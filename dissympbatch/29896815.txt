  Accumulation of amyloid fibrils from β2-microglobulin ( β2M) was first recognized as a characteristic osteoarticular complication in long-term hemodialysis ( HD) patients and called `` HD-related amyloidosis '' ( HRA). However , this syndrome<disease> can also be observed in end-stage renal diseases ( ESRD) patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis , and even in patients with chronic renal<symptom> failure<symptom> before the initiation of dialytic therapy , suggesting that HD is not a direct cause but that accumulation of β2M or some β2M-associated molecules in the body is a common pathogenesis. Currently the term `` dialysis-related amyloidosis '' ( DRA) is widely used for β2M-amyloid ( Aβ2M) amyloidosis associated with ESRD , although DRA patients consist mostly of those undergoing long-term HD. Factors other than β2M accumulation also play a role in the formation/local deposition of Aβ2M and disruption of tissue architecture. Conformational changes of β2M by misfolding/unfolding , and promoting/inhibitory effects induced by other coexisting molecules , advanced glycation and oxidation , and direct cell toxicity have also been documented. Two technological improvements of HD have been the keys to prevent the development and progression of DRA: the efficient removal of β2M by using high-flux membranes<symptom> , high-volume convection and adsorptive column/membrane , as well as the use of biocompatible membranes<symptom> and dialysates ( eg , ultrapure and acetate-free dialysates) have minimized both inflammation<symptom> and β2M production. Epidemiologically , a decrease in the incidence of DRA has recently been reported; however , longer survival of HD patients may contribute to the development of more DRA , though with a delayed onset. In this article , we describe the pathogenesis of DRA , the strategies developed for its prevention and minimization , and the favorable epidemiological data achieved by these efforts.
