  Topical antimicrobials are widely used to control wound<disease> bioburden and facilitate wound<disease> healing; however , the fine balance<symptom> between antimicrobial efficacy and non-toxicity must be achieved. This study evaluated whether an anti-biofilm silver-containing wound<disease> dressing interfered with the normal healing process in non-contaminated deep partial thickness wounds<disease> In an in-vivo porcine wound<disease> model using 2 pigs , 96 wounds<disease> were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 dressing groups: anti-biofilm silver Hydrofiber dressing ( test) , silver Hydrofiber dressing ( control) , or polyurethane film dressing ( control). Wounds<disease> were investigated for 8 days , and wound<disease> biopsies ( n = 4) were taken from each dressing group , per animal , on days 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 after wounding and evaluated using light microscopy. No statistically significant differences were observed in the rate of reepithelialisation , white blood cell infiltration , angiogenesis , or granulation tissue formation following application of the anti-biofilm silver Hydrofiber dressing versus the 2 control dressings. Overall , epithelial thickness was similar between groups. Some differences in infiltration of specific cell types were observed between groups. There were no signs of tissue necrosis<symptom> , fibrosis<disease> , or fatty infiltration in any group. An anti-biofilm silver Hydrofiber wound<disease> dressing did not cause any notable interference with normal healing processes.
