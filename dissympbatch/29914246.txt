  Background/aim: The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostic value of hepcidin level with the white blood cell ( WBC) , C-reactive protein ( CRP) , procalcitonin ( PCT) , and interleukin-6 ( IL-6) levels in pediatric sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom>. Materials and methods: A cohort of 89 individuals were divided into four groups: a healthy control group ( HCG , n = 28) , pediatric intensive care unit control group ( PICUCG , n = 17) , sepsis<disease> group ( SG , n = 23) , and septic shock<symptom> group ( SSG , n = 21). WBC , CRP , PCT , IL-6 , and hepcidin levels were studied in the PICUCG , SG , and SSG , while hepcidin and IL-6 levels were studied in the HCG. Results: In distinguishing the SG and SSG from the HCG , hepcidin sensitivity and specificity were found to be 100 %. Distinguishing between the PICUCG and the SG , hepcidin sensitivity was calculated as 95.6 % and specificity was calculated as 100 %. The sensitivity of WBC , CRP , and PCT was lower than that of hepcidin , but the sensitivity of IL-6 was higher than that of hepcidin. While the specificity of PCT and IL-6 was the same as hepcidin , the specificity of WBC and CRP was lower than that of hepcidin. Conclusion: Hepcidin is a more reliable indicator than WBC and CRP levels in distinguishing children with sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom> from healthy children and nonseptic pediatric ICU patients.
