  Hybrid revascularization combines open lower extremity surgery and endovascular procedures to simultaneously treat atherosclerotic lesions<symptom> on multiple levels in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease ( PAD). Hybrid surgery appears to be a safe strategy for multilevel stenosis revascularization , though the risk of surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> ( SSI) has not been clearly investigated. This study evaluates the development of SSI following common femoral artery endarterectomy ( CFE) and hybrid revascularization procedures. A retrospective study was performed including all patients undergoing CFE , as standalone or as part of a hybrid procedure , due to PAD between January 2013 and December 2016. Preoperative , intraoperative , clinical , and follow-up information was gathered prospectively and reviewed retrospectively. The presence of SSI was recorded based on criteria of the Centre for Disease Control. A total of 229 CFEs were performed. One hundred thirty-two as a standalone procedure , 65 combined with iliofemoral angioplasty , and 32 combined with peripheral angioplasty. Nineteen patients ( 8.3 %) developed an SSI , of which 4 were deep infections. Ten infections ( 7.6 %) occurred in the CFE-only group , 5 ( 7.7 %) in the iliofemoral hybrid group , and 4 ( 12.5 %) in the peripheral hybrid group ( P = 0.65). Five patients ( 2.1 %) required surgery to control the infection. The mean duration of stay was 5 days for patients without SSI versus 20 days for patients who developed an SSI ( P < 0.0001). The hybrid procedure combining open femoral endarterectomy with endovascular revascularization is a safe procedure with no significant differences in infection rates between open surgery , central , or peripheral hybrid revascularization.
