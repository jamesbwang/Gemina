  The aim of this study was to establish the specificity and sensitivity of a simplified screening test based on diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and waist circumference for predicting metabolic syndrome<disease>. Demographic , anthropometric ( waist circumference and systolic and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>) and laboratory ( triglyceride , high-density lipoprotein and fasting glucose) data were collected from a large cohort of Dutch patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder in order to determine whether patients fulfilled the Western criteria of the International Diabetes Federation ( IDF) for metabolic syndrome<disease>. The sensitivity , specificity , likelihood ratio of a positive or negative test outcome and positive and negative predictive values of the simplified test ( only waist circumference and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>) were calculated. Of 252 recruited patients , 55 % met the IDF criteria for metabolic syndrome<disease>. The sensitivity and the specificity of the simplified test were 65 % and 85 % , respectively. The likelihood ratios of positive and negative test outcomes were 4.35 and 0.41 , respectively , and the positive and negative predictive values were 87 % and 67 % , respectively. This simplified screening test did not have diagnostic validity for metabolic syndrome<disease> in a Dutch cohort of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder.
