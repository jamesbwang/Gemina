  Gaucher disease ( GD) and primary myelofibrosis ( PMF) share similar clinical and laboratory features , such as cytopenia<symptom> , hepatosplenomegaly , and marrow fibrosis<disease> , often resulting in a misdiagnosis. We report here the case of a young woman with hepatosplenomegaly , leukopenia<symptom> , and thrombocytopenia<symptom>. Based on bone<disease> marrow ( BM) findings and on liver biopsy showing extramedullary hematopoiesis , an initial diagnosis of PMF was formulated. The patient refused stem cell transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling. Low-dose melphalan was given , without any improvement. Two years later , a BM evaluation showed Gaucher cells. Low glucocerebrosidase and high chitotriosidase levels were indicative for GD. Molecular analysis revealed N370S/complex I mutations. Enzyme replacement therapy with imiglucerase was commenced , resulting in clinical and hematological improvements. Due to an unexpected and persistent organomegaly , PMF combined with GD were suspected. JAK2V617F , JAK2 exon 12 , MPL , calreticulin , and exon 9 mutations were negative , and BM examination showed no marrow fibrosis<disease>. PMF was excluded. Twenty years after starting treatment , the peripheral cell count and liver size were normal , whereas splenomegaly<symptom> persisted. In order to avoid a misdiagnosis , a diagnostic algorithm for patients with hepatosplenomegaly combined with cytopenia<symptom> is suggested.
