  The purpose of this case presentation is to discuss right upper quadrant<symptom> pain<symptom> as an atypical presenting symptom in pulmonary infarction and review the typical computed tomography ( CT) imaging features of pulmonary infarction to improve diagnostic accuracy. Pulmonary infarction results from occlusion of distal arterial vasculature within the lung parenchyma leading to ischemia , hemorrhage<symptom> , and ultimately necrosis<symptom>. Patients with lung infarction typically present with pleuritic<symptom> chest<symptom> pain<symptom> and may have associated signs or symptoms of pulmonary thromboembolism or deep vein thrombosis. In this case study , a 34-yr-old female devoid of any symptoms indicative of either pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis presented with right upper quadrant<symptom> pain<symptom> 1 mo status post open reduction internal fixation for a left ankle fracture. Multiple clinic visits spanning approximately 7 d were significant for a right lower lobe opacity<symptom> seen on CT of the abdomen which was presumed to represent community acquired pneumonia<disease> as a source for the patient 's RUQ pain. The patient presented to the emergency department 1 wk later ( 6 wk following her initial surgery) complaining of left lower extremity swelling and was subsequently diagnosed with a left lower extremity DVT via ultrasound. CT of the pulmonary arteries was negative for PE but identified a right lower lobe opacity<symptom> which in retrospect was consistent with pulmonary infarction.
