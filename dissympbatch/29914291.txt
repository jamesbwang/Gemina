  Development of carcinoid heart disease ( CHD) is the major negative prognostic factor in patients with the carcinoid syndrome<disease>. The only effective treatment is valve replacement. However , the selection of candidates and determination of optimal timing remain unclear. Considerable variability in local screening and treatment strategies exist. In this single-centre study , we retrospectively analysed the diagnostic process and outcome of all CHD patients who underwent valve surgery between 2000 and 2016. We propose a new CHD screening and management algorithm. All patients ( n = 15) , mean age 64 ± 7 , underwent tricuspid valve surgery. In 14 of them ( 93 %) an additional valve was replaced. In only a minority of patients ( 27 %) CHD diagnosis was established by screening. Survival after 1 , 3 , 12 and 24 months was 93 % , 80 % , 53 % and 33 % , respectively. Causes of death included infections and critical illness immediately postoperatively , and tumour progression and right heart<symptom> failure<symptom> in the longer term. There was a trend ( p = .099) towards better preoperative right ventricular function in the patients who survived more than 12 months postoperatively ( TAPSE 20 mm ± 4) compared to those who died between 3 to 12 months after surgery ( TAPSE 16 mm ± 1). The former group had a shorter mean interval from diagnosis of the carcinoid syndrome<disease> to cardiac diagnosis than the latter ( 13 vs. 105 months , p = .014). Mortality after valve replacement for CHD remains high. A probably underestimated cause is late referral for cardiac surgery. We propose a systematic , multidisciplinary approach to all carcinoid syndrome<disease> patients.
