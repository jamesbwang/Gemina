  Activating transcription factor 3 ( ATF3) has been implicated in cardiovascular disease and inflammation<symptom>. This study examined the effects of ATF3 knockout ( KO) on blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , glucose intolerance , dyslipidemia , inflammation<symptom> , and visceral adiposity in mice fed who did and did not consume a high-fructose diet. Male mice were divided into four groups ( N = 15 for each group): the Con ( control) group ( wild-type mice fed a standard chow diet) , Fru group ( wild-type mice fed a high-fructose ( 60 % fructose) diet) , ATF3KO-Con group ( ATF3 KO mice fed a standard chow diet) , and ATF3KO-Fru group ( ATF3 KO mice fed a high-fructose ( 60 % fructose) diet). Experiments were conducted for 8 weeks. Our data demonstrated that ATF3 KO mice have lower systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) levels than do wild-type mice , and that high-fructose diets increase SBP levels in both wild-type and ATF3 KO mice. ATF3 KO in mice increased the serum levels of glucose , insulin , triglycerides , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha , and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 , impaired endothelium-dependent aortic relaxation , increased aorta wall thickness and lipid peroxide , and expanded visceral adiposity. These symptoms resembled those exhibited by the wild-type mice fed a high-fructose diet , which caused hyperglycemia , insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , endothelium-dependent aortic dysfunction , inflammation<symptom> , aorta remodeling , and visceral adiposity. A high-fructose diet among ATF3 KO mice deteriorated metabolic parameters and inflammatory cytokines. The present results therefore suggest that ATF3 deficiency is involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome<disease> and ATF3 might have a therapeutic role in fructose-induced impairment of endothelium-dependent aortic relaxation , a rising of inflammatory cytokines , and metabolic
