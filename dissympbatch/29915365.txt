  Replication initiator 1 ( Repin1) is a zinc finger protein highly expressed in liver and adipose tissue. The Repin1 resides within a quantitative trait locus ( QTL) for body<symptom> weight and triglyceride levels in the rat , and its hepatic deletion in mice results in improved insulin sensitivity and lower body<symptom> weight. Here , we analyzed whether genetic variation within the Repin1 affects parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism. We sequenced REPIN1 in 48 non-related Caucasian subjects. We discovered a 12 base pair deletion ( 12 bp del; rs3832490) , which was subsequently genotyped in two well-characterized cohorts ( N = 3013) to test for associations with metabolic traits. Functional consequences of the variant were investigated in HepG2 cells in vitro. In human cohorts , we show that the 12 bp del associates with improved glucose metabolism ( lower fasting plasma glucose , fasting plasma insulin , and HOMA IR). Cells transfected with the plasmid carrying the 12 bp del variant are characterized by increased GLUT2 and fatty acid translocase<disease> CD36 expression and more lipid droplets. Our data suggest that genetic variation in human REPIN1 plays a role in glucose and lipid metabolism by differentially affecting the expression of REPIN1 target genes including glucose and fatty acid transporters.
