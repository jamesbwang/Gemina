  Metabolic disorders have become among the most serious threats to human health , leading to severe chronic<disease> diseases<disease> such as obesity , type 2 diabetes , and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , as well as cardiovascular diseases. Interestingly , despite the fact that each of these diseases has different physiological and clinical symptoms , they appear to share certain pathological traits such as intracellular stress and inflammation<symptom> induced by metabolic disturbance stemmed from over nutrition frequently aggravated by a modern , sedentary life style. These modern ways of living inundate cells and organs with saturating levels of sugar and fat , leading to glycotoxicity and lipotoxicity that induce intracellular stress signaling ranging from oxidative to ER stress response to cope with the metabolic insults ( Mukherjee , et al. , 2015). In this review , we discuss the roles played by cellular stress and its responses in shaping metabolic disorders. We have summarized here current mechanistic insights explaining the pathogenesis of these disorders. These are followed by a discussion of the latest therapies targeting the stress response pathways.
