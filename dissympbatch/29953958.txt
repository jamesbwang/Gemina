  Amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by an irreversible and extracellular deposition of fibrillar , amorphous protein known as amyloid in different organs and tissues. Amyloid deposits may occur locally in tissues or may involve various organs , resulting in a wide range of clinical manifestations. Amyloidosis of the head and neck is rarely seen and can reflect some plasma cell dyscrasia that affects B lymphocytes. Deposition of amyloid on the tongue is very rare and accounts for less than 9 % of all types of amyloidosis. Amyloid involvement of the tongue is almost always secondary to systemic amyloidosis. We report a 73-year-old female who presented with weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and macroglossia. Firstly , she was diagnosed only with amyloidosis of the tongue. Her general health condition was evaluated , revealing renal dysfunction , anemia<symptom> , hypercalcemia , and hyperphosphatemia. The final diagnosis was systemic amyloidosis with multiple myeloma. The patient was referred for emergency hemodialysis and chemotherapy. Her condition progressed to congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and recurrent urinary and respiratory<disease> infections<disease> After 100 days from diagnosis , the patient died by pulmonary<disease> infection<disease> as a consequence of her weakened state of health. It is important to highlight role of the dentist especially oral pathologist to the evaluation of local alterations that may reflect systemic deterioration of patients.
