  Treatment with anti-TNF- & alpha; ( tumor necrosis<symptom> factor) , one of the pivotal cytokines , was introduced to clinical practice at the end of last century and revolutionized the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) as well as many other inflammatory conditions. Such a treatment may however bring many safety issues regarding infections , tuberculosis<disease> , as well as cardiovascular diseases , including heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Given the central role of proinflammatory cytokines in RA , atherosclerosis , and congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( CHF) , such a treatment might result in better control of the RA process on the one side and improvement of heart function on the other. Unfortunately , at the beginning of this century two randomized controlled trials failed to show any benefit of anti-TNF treatment in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) , suggesting direct negative impact of the treatment on morbidity and mortality in HF patients. As a result the anti-TNF treatment is contraindicated in all patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and a substantial portion of patients with RA and impaired heart function are not able to benefit from the treatment. The role of TNF in CHF and RA differs substantially with regard to the source and pathophysiological function of the cytokine in both conditions , therefore negative data from CHF studies should be interpreted with caution. At least some of RA patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> may benefit from anti-TNF treatment , as it results not only in the reduction of inflammation<symptom> but also contributes significantly to the improvement of cardiac function. The paper addresses the epidemiological data of safety of anti-TNF treatment in RA patients with the special emphasis to basic pathophysiological mechanisms via which TNF may act differently in both diseases.
