  The oral BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax is an effective therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory ( R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL) , including disease with high-risk genomic features such as chromosome 17p deletion ( del ( 17p)) or progressive disease following B-cell receptor pathway inhibitors. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the safety of 400 mg daily venetoclax monotherapy in 350 patients with CLL using an integrated dataset from three phase-I/II studies. Median age was 66 years and 60 % had del ( 17p). Patients had received a median of three prior therapies ( range: 0-15); 42 % previously received ibrutinib or idelalisib. Median duration of exposure to venetoclax was 16 months ( 0-56). In the pooled analysis , the most common adverse events ( AEs) of any grade were diarrhea<disease> ( 41 %) , neutropenia ( 40 %) , nausea<symptom> ( 39 %) , anemia<symptom> ( 31 %) , fatigue<symptom> ( 28 %) , and upper respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( 25 %). The most common grade 3/4 AEs were neutropenia ( 37 %) , anemia<symptom> ( 17 %) , and thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( 14 %). With the current 5-week ramp-up dosing , the incidence of laboratory TLS was 1.4 % ( 2/166) , none had clinical sequelae , and all of these patients were able to ramp-up to a daily dose of 400 mg. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was manageable with growth-factor support and dose adjustments; the incidence of serious infections in these patients was 15 %. Ten percent of patients discontinued venetoclax due to AEs and 8 % died while on study , with the majority of deaths in the setting of disease progression. Venetoclax as a long-term continuous therapy is generally well-tolerated in patients with R/R CLL when initiated with the current treatment algorithm.
