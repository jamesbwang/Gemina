  Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws ( MRONJ) is a known complication of antiresorptive medications with surgical and nonsurgical treatment options. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of nonsurgical therapy using local wound<disease> care on management of MRONJ lesions<symptom>. The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who presented to the University of California-Los Angeles School of Dentistry Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic for evaluation and treatment of MRONJ. The primary predictor variable was wound care score; secondary predictors were demographics ( age , gender) , anatomic location , primary condition , and type and time of antiresorptive treatment. Outcomes assessed were disease resolution and time to disease resolution. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Spearman correlation for continuous and ordinal variables or the Ï‡ One hundred six patients with 117 MRONJ lesions<symptom> were treated using local wound<disease> care; complete disease resolution was observed 71 % of lesions<symptom> , with an additional 22 % of lesions<symptom> undergoing disease improvement. Wound care score was statistically associated with disease resolution and time to resolution , whereas demographics , anatomic site , condition , and type and time of antiresorptive treatment had no effect on resolution. Local wound<disease> care increased the likelihood of MRONJ resolution and decreased the time to disease resolution. This strategy can be used in patients who can not undergo surgery and should be implemented in all patients with MRONJ lesions<symptom> who are managed nonsurgically.
