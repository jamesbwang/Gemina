  To evaluate the cause of NIHF cases referred to a tertiary referral center and to analyze the outcome. A total of 130 cases of fetal hydrops registered during eight-year study period were reviewed. Antenatal ultrasound , blood investigations and postnatal fetal examination were done , and outcome was noted. Out of 130 cases of NIHF , antenatal ultrasound showed the presence of structural malformations in 94/130 ( 72.3 %) , cardiac abnormality was the most common ( 34/130 , 26.1 %) and cystic hygroma was seen in 15/130 ( 11.5 %). Chromosomal abnormality was observed in 15 ( 11.5 %) cases , and Doppler US showed anemia<symptom> in 4/130 ( 3.1 %) cases only. Live born were 25 ( 12.9 %) , and rest all were stillborn or abortion<disease> Later mean gestational age of presentation ( Fetal anemia<symptom> was not a common cause of NIHF in the study population. The early onset of hydrops and presence of structural malformation carry a graver prognosis; type of structural defect also has bearing on outcome.
