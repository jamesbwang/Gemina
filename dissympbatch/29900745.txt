  The coexistence of eosinophilic esophagitis and herpes<disease> simplex<disease> virus in patients has been published in numerous case reports in the last few years. Both entities can be diagnosed simultaneously or one prior to the other , raising a possible causal relationship. Esophageal eosinophilia is a histological finding , and its underlying cause should be investigated. Eosinophilic esophagitis is one of the most common causes of esophageal eosinophilia. Eosinophilic esophagitis is a clinicopathologic disease , which is characterized by dysphagia<symptom> and food impaction. We present a case of a patient with asymtomatic esophageal eosinophilia diagnosed after herpetic esophagitis. Other causes of esophageal eosinophilia were ruled out. Given the recent association between eosinophilic esophagitis and esophagitis due to herpes<disease> simplex<disease> virus , we find ourselves facing a dilemma about assessing the need or not to initiate early treatment.
