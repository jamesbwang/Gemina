  Sepsis<disease> remains a major public health concern , characterized by marked immune dysfunction. Innate lymphoid cells develop from a common lymphoid precursor , but have a role in orchestrating inflammation<symptom> during innate response to infection. Here we investigate the pathological contribution of the group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s) in a murine model of acute septic shock<symptom> ( cecal ligation and puncture). Flow cytometric data revealed that ILC2s increase in number and percentage in the small intestine and in the peritoneal cells , and inversely decline in the liver , at 24 hours following septic insult. Sepsis<disease> also resulted in changes in ILC2 effector cytokine ( IL-13) and activating cytokine ( IL-33) in the plasma of mice and human patients in septic shock<symptom>. Interestingly , the sepsis-induced changes in cytokines were abrogated in mice deficient in functionally invariant NKT cells. Mice deficient in IL-13-producing cells , including ILC2s , had a survival advantage after sepsis<disease> along with decreased morphological evidence of tissue injury and reduced IL-10 levels in the peritoneal fluid. Administration of a suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 ( IL-33R) receptor blocking antibody led to a transient survival advantage. Taken together these findings suggest that ILC2s may play an unappreciated role in mediating the inflammatory response in both mice and humans; further , modulating ILC2 response in vivo may allow development of immunomodulatory strategies directed against
