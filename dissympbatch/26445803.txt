  Atherosclerosis involves activation of the IRAK1/TRAF6/NF-ÎºB inflammatory cascade , which is negatively regulated by miR146a. Previous studies showed that the TT genotype of rs2431697 , located near the miR-146a gene , drives lower miR-146a transcription and predicts adverse cardiovascular events in anticoagulated atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> patients. Moreover , systemic miR-146a administration protects mice from atherosclerosis. Here we evaluated the ability of miR-146a expression in the hematopoietic component to regulate atherosclerosis in low-density lipoprotein receptor-null mice ( Ldlr-/-). Lethally-irradiated Ldlr-/- mice transplanted with bone<disease> marrow from wild-type or miR-146a-null mice were fed an atherogenic diet for 8 and 20 weeks. Irak1 , Traf6 and MIR146A expression were quantified in thoracic aorta by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Aortic plaque size and composition were characterized by Oil-Red staining and immunohistochemistry and leukocyte recruitment by intravital microscopy. Blood cell counts were similar in fat-fed Ldlr-/- mice with or without hematopoietic miR-146a expression. However , plasma cholesterol decreased in fat-fed Ldlr-/- mice transplanted with bone<disease> marrow deficient for miR-146a. Finally , aortic atherosclerosis burden and recruitment of leukocytes into the vessel wall were undistinguishable between the two groups , despite higher levels of Irak1 and Traf6 mRNA and protein in the aorta of fat-fed mice lacking hematopoietic miR-146a expression. miR-146a deficiency exclusively in hematopoietic cells modulates cholesterol levels in plasma and the expression of its targets in the artery wall of fat-fed Ldlr-/- mice , but does not accelerate atherosclerosis. Atheroprotection upon systemic miR-146a administration may therefore be caused by specific effects on vascular cells.
