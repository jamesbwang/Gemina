  Background and aims The prevalence of depression<symptom> is increased among patients with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> ( AP) and Irritable Bowel Syndrome<disease> ( IBS) , but little is known about this association among adolescents in the general population. Furthermore , there is considerable uncertainty about exactly which dimensions of AP and IBS are associated with depression<symptom> The aims of this study were therefore: ( a) to describe the prevalence of AP , IBS and depression<symptom> in a representative sample of adolescents , ( b) to analyze the association of AP and IBS with depression<symptom> and lastly , ( c) to analyze the relationship between depression<symptom> and specific AP and IBS symptom dimensions , i.e. pain intensity , frequency , duration , and distribution , the presence of co-morbid non-abdominal pain , and the specific bowel systems distinguishing IBS from AP in general. Materials and methods Self-reported symptoms of AP ( monthly or more frequent) , IBS ( Rome III 2006 criteria) , co-morbid chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> and depression<symptom> ( The Short Mood and Feeling Questionnaire sum-score ≥ 11) were recorded among 961 adolescents ( mean age 16.1 y and 48.8 % girls) , participating in a population based study in 2010-2011. Multiple logistic regression carried out to analyze the association of AP and IBS with depression<symptom> , adjusting for sex , parental level of education ( < college or ≥ college) and co-morbid chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Among the AP cases , the association of different AP dimensions and of the specific bowel symptoms in IBS with depression<symptom> were analyzed in a stepwise multiple logistic regression model. Results Monthly or more frequent AP was reported by 27 % of the participants ( n = 259) and 8.2 % ( n = 77) met the Rome III IBS criteria. The prevalence of depression<symptom> was 11.5 % ( girls 15.9 % and boys 7.3 %). The prevalence of depression<symptom> was higher among both AP and IBS cases compared to in controls ( 20.5 % , 24.7 % and 8.1 % respectively) , but there was no evidence that depression<symptom> rates differed between the two case groups ( IBS: OR = 2.5 , 95 % CI = 1.6-3.9; AP: OR = 2.4 with 95 % CI = 1.3-4.4 , after adjusting for sex , parental level of education and co-morbid chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>). In the regression analyses within the AP group , the following symptom dimensions were independently associated with depression<symptom>: severe<symptom> abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> intensity ( OR = 4.0; CI = 1.5-10.7) , widespread abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> ( OR = 5.5; CI = 2.6-11.8) and presence of co-morbid chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> ( OR = 3.3; CI = 1.6-6.8). Sex , parental education , and other abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> symptom<symptom> dimensions , including bowel symptoms that distinguish IBS from AP , were not independently associated with depression<symptom> Conclusions and implications The prevalence of depression<symptom> is considerably increased among adolescents with AP and IBS in the general population , in particular among those reporting severe , widespread abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , and co-morbid chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Evaluating these symptom dimensions may be of value for identifying subgroups adolescents with AP and IBS that have greater risk of
