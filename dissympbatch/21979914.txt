  Meier-Gorlin syndrome<disease> ( MGS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the triad of microtia , absent or small patellae and short stature. The other associated clinical features may include developmental delay , congenital pulmonary emphysema , gastro-esophageal reflux , urogenital anomalies , such as cryptorchidism and feeding problems. The facial characteristics during childhood are typical , comprising of a small mouth<symptom> with full lips and micrognathia/retrognathia. The condition is rare affecting about one to nine individuals per million. Mutation in the genes of pre-replication complex involved in DNA-replication is detected in the majority of patients. This impedes the cellular proliferation resulting in a reduction of total cell number and thereby retardation of overall growth. This case report describe the typical dentofacial characteristics in a 5 years old child affected with Meier-Gorlin syndrome<disease> along with other associated anomalies and a multidisciplinary approach for their management.
