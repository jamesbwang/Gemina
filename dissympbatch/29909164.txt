  Why? The potential risks of sport for an ICD recipient include appropriate and inappropriate shocks<disease> , device damage and worsening of the underlying cardiopathy. These risks should be compared to the physical and psychological benefits of exercise. Where? Due to different medico-legal contexts and considering the results of recent studies , the new US guidelines are more permissive than the European guidelines regarding sport practice in ICD recipients. Who? The underlying context ( structural or electrical cardiopathy , psychological impact) should be assessed before any decision is taken. What sport? The intensity and duration of the exercise , the environment , the type of sport ( bodily contact sports or compromising the costoclavicular area) and the potential consequences for the patient or the spectators of a possible loss of consciousness<symptom> must to be anticipated. How? The patient 's information on the consequences of the ICD on his subsequent physical activity must be delivered before the device implantation. In addition , the type and programming of the ICD must be personalized according to the sport. When? The patient should wait at least 6 weeks after ICD implantation to return to leisure sport and after an exercise test has been performed. After a ventricular arrhythmia , the patient must wait 3 months before returning to sport.
