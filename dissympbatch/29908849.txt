  The NATO KAIA Hospital ( Kabul International Airport) , under French command , provided medical support for NATO forces in the Kabul region from 2009 to 2014. Medical assistance to civilians was an additional mission which included support for children who were war injured. The objective of this study was to analyze characteristics of cephalic injuries in children victims of war trauma. A retrospective study was conducted and commenced with the hospital opening ( July 2009) to March 2012 on all children ( < 15 years) with war trauma. We distinguished cephalic lesions<symptom> in cranial ( neuro-surgical) , ophthalmological and neck regions. We analyzed mechanism , region , severity score , surgeries and resuscitation efforts. 217 children were operated on with 81 war traumas ( mean age 10.2 years). 36 children ( 44.4 %) had a cephalic injury. 52.9 % of the injured had an ophthalmological injury , 38.2 % a cranial region injury and 29.4 % a neck lesion<symptom>. Mortality rate was 5.6 % ( 1 hemorrhagic shock<symptom> and 1 cerebral wound<disease>) in this cephalic lesion<symptom> group. Ophthalmic injuries were the most common of cephalic injuries; 19 children of which 7 had a bilateral injury ( 26 eyes). In this group , fragmentary injuries were the most frequent ( 64 % of eyes). In cerebral lesion<symptom> group , the lesions<symptom> were linked to a bullet or a shrapnel in 9 of 13 children. This mechanism systematically caused a crania-cerebral wound<disease>. Explosion ( fragmentary and shrapnel) was the most important in the neck lesions<symptom> ( 7 children of 10). The cephalic lesions<symptom> were the second most common region in children during our experience in Afghanistan. Lack of protection ( helmet) in children may explain the frequency of cephalic
