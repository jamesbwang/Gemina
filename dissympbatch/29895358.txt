  Elevated levels of calprotectin and other inflammatory mediators have been observed in inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> paralleling serum hypozincemia. While a role of zinc in the regulation of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α , interleukin ( IL) -1 β and IL-6 expression has been established , the direct interrelation of zinc and calprotectin ( S100A8/S100A9 heterodimer) expression is so far missing. In the present study , we analyzed mRNA and protein levels of S100A8 and S100A9 in monocytic Mono Mac ( MM) 1 and early myeloid THP-1 and U937 cells to elucidate the effect of zinc deficiency on their expression. We could depict that zinc deficiency alone enhances mRNA and protein expression of calprotectin in myeloid cells , independently from maturity stage. Moreover , pre-existing zinc deficiency augmented lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced calprotectin expression in CD14
