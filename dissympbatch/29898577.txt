  The relationship between nonpulmonary organ<symptom> failure<symptom> and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> ( ARDS) in patients with sepsis<disease> has not been well studied. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with septic bacteremia admitted to the medical intensive care unit ( ICU) of a tertiary academic hospital between January 2013 and December 2016. The study enrolled 125 patients of median age 73.0 years. Urinary ( n = 47) , hepatobiliary ( n = 30) , and pulmonary<disease> infections<disease> ( n = 28) were the most common causes of sepsis<disease>; the incidence of ARDS was 17.6 %. The total number of nonpulmonary organ<symptom> failures<symptom> at the time of ICU admission was higher in patients with ARDS than in those without ( p = 0.011) , and the cardiovascular , central nervous system ( CNS) , and coagulation scores were significantly higher in ARDS patients. On multivariate analysis , apart from pneumonia<disease> sepsis<disease> , the CNS ( odds ratio ( OR) , 1.917; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.097 to 3.348) and coagulation scores ( OR , 2.669; 95 % CI , 1.438 to 4.954) were significantly associated with ARDS development. The 28-day and in-hospital mortality rates were higher in those with ARDS than in those without ( 63.6 vs. 8.7 % , p < 0.001; 72.7 % vs. 11.7 % , p < 0.001) , and ARDS development was found to be an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality. Apart from pneumonia<disease> , CNS dysfunction and coagulopathy were significantly associated with ARDS development , which was an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality.
