  Schistosomiasis is one of the most important neglected tropical diseases. If unrecognised and untreated , the chronic<disease> infection<disease> can lead to irreversible complications. Retrospective observational study aimed at describing clinical history , laboratory findings and imaging presentation of imported schistosomiasis diagnosed at the Centre for Tropical Diseases , Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital of Negrar , Verona , Italy from 2010 to 2014. The aim of our study was to assess differences in demographic characteristics , clinical presentation , laboratory data and ultrasound findings between immigrants/visiting friends and relatives ( VFR) from endemic countries ( endemic group) and expatriates/travellers ( non-endemic group). A total of 272 patients were retrieved: 234 in the endemic and 38 in the non-endemic group. Most of the patients acquired schistosomiasis in Africa ( 97.4 %). Symptoms were reported by 52.9 % of the patients; abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> ( 36 %) , macroscopic hematuria<symptom> ( 11.3 %) , and genito-urinary symptoms ( 7.4 %) being the most frequently reported. Increased IgE and blood eosinophilia were observed in 169 ( 63.8 %) and 130 ( 47.8 %) patients , respectively. The proportion of positive serology was 250/272 ( 91.9 %). The Circulating Cathodic Antigen CCA for Schistosoma mansoni was positive in 14/61 individuals ( 23 %). At microscopy , infected subjects were 103/272 ( 37.9 %). The species of Schistosoma found were S. haematobium ( 47.6 %) , S. mansoni ( 46.6 %) or both ( 5.8 %). Schistosomiasis was classified as confirmed in 103 ( 37.9 %) , probable in 165 ( 60.6 %) and suspected in 4 ( 1.5 %) cases using clinical presentation , laboratory data and ultrasound findings. The infection was further classified based on organ involvement: intestinal ( 17.9 %) , hepatosplenic ( 5.1 %) , urogenital ( 48.9 %) , and indeterminate ( 43.8 %). The comparative analysis of endemic and non-endemic patients highlighted differences in sex and age. Endemic patients had more frequent ova identification ( 41.9 % vs. 13.2 % , P < 0.001) and increased IgE ( 70 % vs. 26.3 % , P < 0.001) when compared with non-endemic. Multivariate analyses showed that younger age , abnormal ultrasound findings and blood eosinophilia were significantly associated with positive microscopy ( OR = 0.94 , OR = 2.12 , OR = 1.98 , respectively). Symptoms , eosinophilia and abnormal ultrasound findings were present in about half of patients , without differences between groups. Many patients had positive serology but negative microscopy , indicating that schistosomiasis might be misdiagnosed. A combination of diagnostic tools may facilitate the diagnosis.
