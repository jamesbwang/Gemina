  The present study designed to evaluate the toxic effect of anatase TiO2 NPs on BALF biochemical changes and liver alteration in rats. Titanium dioxide ( TiO2) nanoparticles ( NPs) are utilized in food color additives and cosmetics worldwide. Humans uptake these nanoparticulate by different routes and may exhibit potential side effects , lags behind the rapid development of nanotechnology. Sixty-three mats rats were used. Included by the control group and the experimental groups treated twice a week with 0.5 , 5 , 50 , 1.5 , 15 , 150 mg/kg of nano-TiO2 ( size 21 nm) , for four consecutive weeks. Animals were sacrificed at 4 days , a month and three months post-instillation. The levels of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor- α ( TNF-α) and macrophage inflammatory protein- 2 ( MIP-2) were measured in the lung homogenate and in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF) supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) and histopathological examination of liver tissue was performed. The results showed that TiO2 NP induces many alterations in the liver structure after 4 days , a month and reduced after 3 months from intratracheal instillation. This included liver heavy infiltration of inflammatory cells , an increase of collagen density in portal triads , beginning of fibrosis<disease> formation and Glisson capsule thickness increase and TiO2 NPs reached the liver tissue after a month from exposure at all doses especially low doses ( 0.5 , 1.5 , 5) mg/kg of TiO2 NPs. The immune system was strongly responded in the groups treated with high doses ( 15 , 50 , 150) mg/kg of TiO2 NP leading to raising the concentration of α-TNF , and MIP-2 in BALF while they decrease in tissue homogenate.
