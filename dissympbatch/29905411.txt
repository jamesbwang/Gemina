  Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) are of increased importance because of their capacity to counteract inflammation<symptom> and suppress host immune responses. The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of MSCs and hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA). Paw swelling was assessed by measuring the thickness of the hind paws using a caliper. Cytokines- interleukin ( IL) -6 , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha ( TNF-α) , transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-β) , and IL-10- and rheumatoid factor ( RF) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) kits. Oxidative stress biomarkers- malondialdehyde ( MDA) and reduced glutathione ( GSH) were assessed. Nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-κB) was detected by the western blot technique. Toll-like receptor-2 ( TLR-2) , matrix metalloproteinase-3 ( MMP-3) and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein-1 ( COMP-1) gene expression were assessed by the real-time quantitative analysis. Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from the bone<disease> marrow ( BM) of rats and HSCs were isolated from human umbilical cord blood ( UCB). Paw edema<symptom> , RA score , RF , cytokine assay , antioxidant state , NF-κB , TLR-2 , MMP3 , and COMP-1 showed improvement in the group that received MSCs compared to the group that received HSCs and the group that received methotrexate. Mesenchymal stem cells are very effective in reducing RA inflammation<symptom>; they are superior to HSC and methotrexate treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells could become a better therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of RA.
