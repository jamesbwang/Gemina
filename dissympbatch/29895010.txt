  Cardiometabolic risk factors like abdominal obesity , hyperglycemia , low high-density lipoprotein ( HDL) cholesterol , elevated triglycerides , and hypertension are defined as metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) , which represents one of the most frequent endocrine disorders particularly in a society with increasing weight problems. As more and more evidence is accumulated that thyroid hormones affect components of the MetS , the present review aims to summarize the rapidly expanding knowledge on the pathophysiological interaction between thyroid hormone status and MetS. The review is based on a PubMed search for combinations of thyroid hormone action and MetS , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , glucose , diabetes mellitus , body<symptom> weight , or visceral fat. A special focus was given for manuscripts published after 2000 but we included seminal papers published before year 2000 as well.
