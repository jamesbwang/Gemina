  PEDV variants , causing severe<symptom> diarrhea<disease> in neonatal suckling piglets with a mortality rate up to 100 % , have being epidemic since late 2010 in china. To meet the pressing need of safe and cost-efficient PED maternal vaccines against PEDV variant , we vaccinated growing piglets with a flagellin-adjuvanted PED vaccine rSF-COE-3D by injection at Houhai acupoint. The vaccination not only enhanced the antibody responses of serum IgG/IgA , mucosal IgA and serum neutralizing antibody , but also improved the production of IFN-Î³ and IL-4. Moreover , rSF-COE-3D could provide a better protection against the challenge of a high pathogenic PEDV variant , with less diarrhea<disease> pigs , less pigs with detectable PEDV shed , lower rank values of feces and less apparent lesions<symptom> and inflammation<symptom> in duodenum of the PEDV infected pigs. The improved protective efficiency of rSF-COE-3D compared with COE was mostly benefited from the enhanced production of serum IgA , mucosal IgA in feces and serum neutralizing antibody titers. Taken together , our data suggest that rSF-COE-3D would be a novel efficient PED vaccine.
