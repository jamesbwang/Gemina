  To evaluate the response of aging rats with sepsis<disease> to two different antibiotic regimens. The study was conducted with 30 aging rats ( 18 month-old) with autologous feces peritonitis<disease> The animals were divided into three groups: Group 0 received no therapeutic intervention ( control) , while Group 1 received a single dose of 40 mg/kg meropenem and Group 2 received a single dose of 20 mg/kg moxifloxacin. The intervention in both Groups was made 6 hours after induction of peritonitis<disease> The animals were followed up to 15 days for evaluating morbidity and mortality. The weights at baseline were similar in all groups. At the end of follow-up , weight<symptom> loss<symptom> was significantly greater ( p = 0.0045) in Group 0 ( non-intervention controls). Culture from a blood sample at the end of follow-up was positive in all the animals in Group 0 , in two animals in Group 1 and in four animals in Group 2. Morbidity/mortality was significantly higher in Group 0 compared to both Groups 1 and 2 ( p = 0.003) but the scores were not significantly different between Groups 1 and 2 ( p = 0.6967). Both antibiotic regimens rendered promising results for the treatment of fecal
