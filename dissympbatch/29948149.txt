  We present the case of a 39-year-old female patient with cystoid macular edema<symptom> of the left eye in the context of sympathetic ophthalmia<disease>. The right eye underwent several surgical interventions of both cornea and retina after ocular trauma and was enucleated after first clinical signs compatible with sympathetic ophthalmia<disease> and after exclusion of other infectious/non-infectious etiologies. The patient was treated with parabulbar triamcinolone injections and intravitreal injections of a dexamethasone slow-release implant with a good clinical course with respect to the macular edema<symptom>. A steroid response did not occur over the treatment period of more than 12 months.
