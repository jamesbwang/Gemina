  COPD Assessment in Primary Care To Identify Undiagnosed Respiratory<disease> Disease<disease> and Exacerbation Risk ( CAPTURE ™) uses five questions and peak expiratory flow ( PEF) thresholds ( males ≤ 350 L/min; females ≤ 250 L/min) to identify patients with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV Data from the CAPTURE development study were used to test its sensitivity ( SN) and specificity ( SP) differentiating mild-to-moderate COPD ( n = 73) from no COPD ( n = 87). SN and SP for differentiating all COPD cases ( mild to severe; n = 259) from those without COPD ( n = 87) were also estimated. The modified Medical Research Council ( mMRC) dyspnea<symptom> scale and COPD Assessment Test ( CAT ™) were used to evaluate symptoms and health status. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT01880177 , https://ClinicalTrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01880177?term=NCT01880177&rank=1. Mean age ( + SD): 61 ( +10.5) years; 41 % male. COPD: FEV CAPTURE ( 450/350) may be useful for identifying symptomatic patients with mild-to-moderate airflow obstruction in need of diagnostic evaluation for COPD.
