  To show that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS) delivered at high frequency over the motor cortex can improve patients with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> syndrome<disease> even if this procedure does not provide an analgesic response. A 77-year-old woman presented with drug-resistant chronic neuropathic pain affecting both lower limbs due to segmental spine compression at T9-T10 level. She underwent an rTMS protocol with an induction phase of 12 rTMS sessions during three weeks and a maintenance phase of 3 additional rTMS sessions for 5 weeks. Stimulation was delivered over the vertex using a MCF-B70 coil at 10Hz and 80 % of rest motor threshold , with 2000 pulses per session. Assessment was based on pain , quality of life , anxiety-depression , and walking abilities. Although pain intensity remained stable throughout the study period ( 8/10 on a numerical rating scale) , the quality of life ( physical and mental components of the SF-36 scale) , anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> scores , and walking capacity dramatically improved at the end of the treatment and up to 6 weeks after the last rTMS sessions. This case shows that repeated sessions of high-frequency motor cortex rTMS delivered on the bihemispheric cortical representation of the lower limb<symptom> muscles can improve daily functioning in patients with chronic neuropathic pain affecting the lower limbs , even in the absence of pain relief. Motor cortex rTMS may have a therapeutic impact in pain patients by acting on different brain circuits and the various induced changes can contribute to overall patient satisfaction in the long-term.
