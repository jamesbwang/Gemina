  To report the safety and efficacy of single-port pars plana anterior vitrectomy. Cincinnati Eye Institute , Cincinnati , Ohio , USA. Retrospective case series. Eyes that had anterior vitrectomy from September 2010 to June 2016 were electronically identified. Charts were reviewed for demographics , history of ocular trauma , underlying ocular or systemic comorbidity , surgical indications , outcomes , and postoperative complications. The mean postoperative follow-up was 10.9 months with a mean patient age of 62.4 years. Three hundred thirty-five eyes ( 97.7 %) were scheduled as planned anterior vitrectomies , whereas 8 eyes ( 2.3 %) were operated on unexpectedly after posterior capsule ruptures. Eighty-two eyes ( 23.9 %) had a history of trauma. Twenty-five eyes ( 7.3 %) had documented postoperative cystoid macular edema<symptom> ( CME) , whereas 7 ( 2.0 %) of these eyes had known preoperative CME. There were 3 eyes ( 0.9 %) with retinal detachments and 1 eye ( 0.3 %) with a retinal tear without detachment. There were no cases of endophthalmitis<disease> and no evidence of residual vitreous prolapse in the anterior chamber in any eye postoperatively. The safety and efficacy profile of a pars plana technique compared favorably against historical data for both coaxial and bimanual limbal clear corneal infusion and cutting. Sutureless pars plana anterior vitrectomy might be considered a safe and reliable solution for the anterior segment surgeon in managing vitreous prolapse during anterior segment surgeries.
