  Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven chronic inflammatory disorder of the arteries , and monocytes and macrophages play a central role in this process. Within the atherosclerotic lesion<symptom> , macrophages can scavenge modified lipids and become the so-called foam cells. We previously reported that the epigenetic enzyme Kdm6b ( also known as Jmjd3) controls the pro-fibrotic transcriptional profile of peritoneal foam cells. Given the importance of these cells in atherosclerosis , we now studied the effect of myeloid Kdm6b on disease progression. Bone<disease> marrow of myeloid Kdm6b deficient ( Kdm6b Lesion<symptom> size was similar in Kdm6b Myeloid Kdm6b deficiency results in more advanced atherosclerosis.
