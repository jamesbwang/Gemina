  The present study was designed to evaluate the relationship between gender and coexisting anxiety<symptom> in patients undergoing coronary artery surgery. Materials and Methods: A total of 137 patients ( 41 women and 96 men with a mean age 66.1 ± 6.0 years) patients underwent state and trait anxiety<symptom> evaluation at baseline ( preoperatively) and at six months after ( postoperatively) coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG). Anxiety<symptom> symptoms were assessed at enrollment using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety<symptom> Inventory ( STAI). Psychological , social , clinical , and surgical data were assessed statistically. Results: There were statistically significant differences between female and male patient characteristics for the mean age , mean education year , and mean body mass index. The women were found to be statistically younger and less educated , and more likely to be overweight , diabetic , and hyperlipidemic. The mean hospitalization time , wound<disease> infection<disease> , and extreme postoperative pain complaints were found to be higher in the female group. 61 patients ( 33 female and 28 male) ( 44.5 %) were classified as presenting clinically significant anxiety<symptom> symptoms ( STAI score of ≥ 40). The female patients ' STAI scores were significantly higher than men in state and trait anxiety<symptom> , both preoperatively and six months postoperatively. Postoperatively , there was not any significant decrease in the level of trait anxiety<symptom> when comparing the level of state anxiety<symptom> in female patients. Conclusion: Even after adjusting for known risk factors for compromised STAI , women do not show the same long-term quality benefits of CABG surgery that men do. The results indicate that the STAI is a valuable instrument for identifying and supporting patients with higher levels of anxiety<symptom> , which can aid in determining patients that may have poor adjustment after CABG surgery.
