  To characterize the clinical features among dogs sustaining rib fractures and to determine if age , type and severity of injury , entry blood lactate , trauma score and rib fracture score were associated with outcome. A retrospective study was performed to include dogs that were presented with rib fractures. Risk factors evaluation included breed , age , body<symptom> weight , diagnosis , presence of a flail chest , bandage use , puncture wound<disease> presence , rib fracture number , location of the fracture along the thoracic wall , hospital stay length , body<symptom> weight , other fractures , pleural effusion<symptom> , pulmonary contusions , pneumothorax and occurrence of an anaesthetic event. A retrospective calculation of an animal trauma triage ( ATT) score , RibScore and Modified RibScore was assigned. Forty-one medical records were collected. Motor vehicular trauma represented 56 % of the rib fracture aetiology , 41 % of patients sustained dog bites and one case was of an unknown aetiology. Significant correlations with risk factors were found only with the ATT score. All patients that died had an ATT score â‰¥ 5. The ATT score correlated positively with mortality ( There was no increased mortality rate in canine patients that presented with the suspected risk factors. The only risk factor that predicted mortality was the ATT score.
