  Erdheim-Chester disease ( ECD) is a rare histiocytosis , characterized by xanthogranulomatous tissue infiltration by foamy histiocytes. Fibrosis<disease> , a histologic hallmark of ECD , is responsible for lesion<symptom> growth and clinical manifestations. Unraveling molecular fibrotic pathway in ECD would allow the identification of new pharmacologic targets. In this study , we evaluated serum and tissue samples from a large cohort of ECD patients focusing on two major pro-fibrotic mediators , TGF-β1 and chemokine ligand 18 ( CCL18). We found a marked increase in CCL18 but not TGF-β1 levels in serum and lesions<symptom> of ECD patients (
