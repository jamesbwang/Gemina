  Boswellia dalzielii is a tall tree ( more than 13 m high) that produces aromatic white flowers. This plant is commonly used in indigenous medicine across Africa against diarrhea<disease> , malaria<disease> , vomiting , inflammation<symptom> and arthritis<disease>. The present study focuses on the anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritis potential of methanol extract of Boswellia dalzielii ( BDME). Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in inflammatory models induced by carrageenan , arachidonic acid , histamine , serotonin , prostaglandin and bradykinin. Anti-arthritis activity was measured using complete Freund 's adjuvant model. Intracellular and extracellular ROS production and proliferation of T-cells were evaluated using chemiluminescence and liquid scintillation counter techniques , respectively. TNF-α and IL-1β production were assessed using ELISA and MTT assay performed for cytotoxicity. BDME revealed a significant anti-inflammatory effect by preventing the development of edema<symptom> caused by carrageenan , arachidonic acid , histamine , serotonin , prostaglandin and bradykinin. For anti-arthritic properties of BDME , the results showed a significant reduction of the joint diameter and a decrease in pain in the treated animals. The extract also showed a noticeable systemic effect , maintaining the values of the evaluated parameters close to normal in treated rats with an inhibition of joint destruction as shown in histopathological analysis. Furthermore , BDME exhibited significant inhibition of extracellular and intracellular ROS production. Still , the extract displayed significant inhibitory activity on T-cell proliferation as well as a reduced production of TNF-α and IL-1β. Boswellia dalzielii could be considered as a promising tract in the prevention and/or management of
