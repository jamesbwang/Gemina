  Influenza<disease> leads to significant cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality-particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease-that may be prevented with a standard influenza<disease> vaccine. However , patients with cardiovascular conditions have a reduced immune response to influenza<disease> vaccine , potentially resulting in reduced effectiveness for preventing clinical events. High-dose vaccine augments immune response in cardiac patients , suggesting that a high-dose influenza<disease> vaccination strategy may further reduce morbidity and mortality. Alternatively , broader coverage with an influenza<disease> vaccine containing an increased number of viral strains is an alternative strategy without direct evaluation. INfluenza<disease> Vaccine to Effectively Stop Cardio Thoracic Events and Decompensated heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( INVESTED) is a pragmatic , randomized , double-blind , parallel-group , active-controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of an annual vaccination strategy of high-dose trivalent versus standard-dose quadrivalent influenza<disease> vaccine in patients with a history of recent heart<symptom> failure<symptom> or myocardial infarction hospitalization. The trial will enroll approximately 9,300 patients over 4 influenza<disease> seasons. The primary hypothesis is that high-dose influenza<disease> vaccine will reduce the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and hospitalization from a cardiovascular or pulmonary cause compared with standard-dose influenza<disease> vaccine within each enrolling season. Approximately 1,300 primary outcome events will provide > 90 % power to detect an 18 % relative risk reduction at a 2-sided Î± level of .05. INVESTED is the largest and longest study to assess whether high-dose influenza<disease> vaccine is superior to standard-dose influenza<disease> vaccine in reducing cardiopulmonary events in a high-risk cardiovascular population ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02787044).
