  Ulcerative colitis<disease> causes recurring intestinal mucosal injury and sustained inflammation<symptom> , increasing the likelihood of colorectal cancer ( CRC) development. Dietary red raspberry ( RB) is a rich source of phytonutrients known to have anti-inflammatory activity; however , the role of RB on CRC prevention in chronic colitis<disease> has not been examined. This study examined the effects of dietary RB supplementation on inflammation<symptom> , epithelium repair , and oncogenic signaling in dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS)- induced chronic colitis<disease> in mice. Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a control or RB ( 5 % of dry feed weight; n = 12/group) diet for 10 wk. Starting from the fourth week , mice were administered 2 repeated cycles of 1 % DSS ( 7-d DSS treatment plus 14-d recovery) and were monitored daily for disease activity index ( DAI) score. Colonic tissues were collected at the end of the study for histochemical , immunohistochemical , and biochemical analysis of inflammation<symptom> , differentiation and proliferation markers. RB supplementation reduced the DAI score and histologic damage ( by 38.9 %; P ≤ 0.01) , expression of inflammatory mediators ( by 20-70 %; P ≤ 0.01) , infiltration of CD4 T cells ( by 50 %; P ≤ 0.05) , and α4β7 integrin and related adhesion molecules ( by 33.3 %; P ≤ 0.01). Furthermore , RB supplementation facilitated epithelium repair , as evidenced by enhanced goblet cell density , expression of transcription factors including Kruppel-like factor 4 ( Klf4) and Hairy and enhancer of split 1 ( Hes1) , terminal differentiation markers , mucin 2 ( Muc2) , and intestinal alkaline phosphatase ( by 20-200 %; P ≤ 0.01). Conversely , proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( by 70 %; P ≤ 0.01) , β-catenin , and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3) signaling ( by 19-33 %; P ≤ 0.05) were reduced by RB supplementation. In addition , RB supplementation enhanced p53 stability ( by 53 %) and reduced oncogenic gene expression ( by 50-60 %). RB supplementation reduced DAI score and the risk of CRC development during recurring colitis<disease> in mice , suggesting that RB is a possible dietary supplement for patients with ulcerative colitis<disease> and related gut
