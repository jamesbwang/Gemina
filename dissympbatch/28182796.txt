  Having access to improved water , sanitation , and hygiene ( WASH) facilities constitute a key component of healthy living and quality of life. Prolonged exposure to insanitary living conditions can significantly enhance the burden of infectious<disease> diseases<disease> among children and affect nutritional status and growth. In this study we examined the prevalence of some common infectious diseases/disease symptoms of childhood among under-five children in Nigeria , and the association between the occurrence of these diseases with household & rsquo; s access to WASH facilities. Types of diseases used as outcome variables included diarrheal , and acute<disease> respiratory<disease> infections<disease> ( fever<disease> and cough<symptom> Access to WASH facilities were defined by WHO classification. The association between diarrhoea<disease> , fever<disease> and chronic<symptom> cough<symptom> with sanitation , and hygiene was analyzed by logistic regression techniques. Results showed that the prevalence of diarrhoea<disease> , fever<disease> and cough<symptom> was respectively 10.5 % ( 95 % CI = 9.7 ⁻ 2.0) , 13.4 % ( 95 % CI = 11.9 ⁻ 14.8) , and 10.4 % ( 95 % CI = 9.2 ⁻ 11.5). In the regression analysis , children in the households that lacked all three types of facilities were found to have respectively 1.32 ( AOR = 1.329 , 95 % CI = 1.046 ⁻ 1.947) , 1.24 ( AOR = 1.242 , 95 % CI = 1.050 ⁻ 1.468) and 1.43 ( AOR = 1.432 , 95 % CI = 1.113 ⁻ 2.902) times higher odds of suffering from diarrhea<disease> , fever<disease> and cough<symptom> The study concludes that unimproved WASH conditions is an important contributor to ARIs and diarrheal morbidities among Nigerian children. In light of these findings , it is recommended that programs targeting to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality from common infectious<disease> diseases<disease> should leverage equitable provision of WASH interventions.
