  Fatigue<symptom> is common among patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD). Pro-inflammatory cytokines are elevated in chronic inflammation<symptom> and can induce `` sickness behaviors '' , such as fatigue<symptom>. Chronic<disease> inflammatory states also lead to growth hormone ( GH) resistance , demonstrated by low levels of Insulin-like Growth Factor ( IGF-1) and elevated GH. This study evaluated the relationship between IGF-1 , pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and fatigue<symptom> in patients with IBD. This prospective study of children with IBD , ages 10-16 years , were recruited from a sub-specialty ambulatory clinic. Participants and their parents completed age-appropriate generic and disease-specific health related quality of life ( HRQOL) instruments. Serum samples obtained at the same encounter were analyzed for Th17 cytokine and IGF-1 levels. HRQOL scores were compared to a healthy sample and HRQOL scores and cytokine levels were compared by IGF-1 z-score quartiles. 67 IBD patients were recruited , median age of 13.7 years ( IQR , 11.7-15.3). 48 ( 72 %) had inactive disease based on Physician Global Assessment. IBD patients reported lower generic HRQOL ( p = 0.0006) and more fatigue<symptom> ( p = 0.0004) than a healthy sample. Patients with IGF-1 z scores in the lowest quartile had significantly lower disease-specific HRQOL ( p = 0.01) and more fatigue<symptom> ( p = 0.02) than the remainder of the cohort. Serum IL-10 , IL-17A , IL-6 , Interferon-Î³ were significantly higher in IBD patients with IGF-1 z scores in the lowest quartile ( p < 0.05). Children with sub-clinical IBD experience more fatigue<symptom> and lower generic HRQOL than healthy children. Lower IGF-1 z scores are associated with more fatigue<symptom> , and this relationship may be mediated through pro-inflammatory cytokines.
