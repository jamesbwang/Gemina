  Up to one third of patients with T-cell large granular lymphocyte<symptom> leukemia<disease> ( T-LGL-leukemia) display symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA). In Crohn 's disease and in psoriasis treatment with TNFα-inhibitors is associated with hepatosplenic γδT-cell-lymphoma and with clonal expansion of γδT-cells , respectively. Here , we determine the prevalence of clonal T-LGL cells in patients with RA and define risk factors for this rare hematologic malignancy. 529 RA-patients were recruited between November , 2013 and August , 2015. Eight color flow cytometry ( FACS) was performed to screen for aberrant T-cell populations of large granular lymphocytes. Molecular analysis of the T-cell receptor was used to confirm the diagnosis in patients with suggestive FACS findings. Electronic patient files were used to determine risk factors. Patients with clonal populations were monitored prospectively for up to 4 years. The median patient age was 61 years , 74 % were female. The median disease duration of RA was 12.0 years. Median DAS28 was 2.8. 69.9 % have ever been treated with biologic DMARDs. We identified clonal T-LGL expansions in 19 patients equaling a prevalence of 3.5 %. The T-LGL cell clone is constant over time in most patients and is significantly associated with the duration of the exposure to TNFα-blocking agents ( p-value 0.01). No other risk factors could be detected. RA-patients with long term exposure to TNFα-blocking agents were at a greater risk of developing clonal expansions of large granular lymphocytes. This finding may prompt clinicians to refrain from using these substances in RA patients with known T-cell aberrations. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
