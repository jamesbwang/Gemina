  In this study , a collagen-induced arthritis<disease> ( CIA) model was established to simulate rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) using two intradermal injections of bovine type II collagen and Freund 's complete adjuvant mixture given at two-week intervals. Subsequently , the transplantation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells ( hUC-MSCs) was used to treat RA and the treatment efficacy , as well as the possible regulatory mechanism underlying hUC-MSC transplantation , was observed. During the study , forty rats were randomly divided into four groups and their blood samples were collected at different time points to measure levels of serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein ( COMP). Based on the symptoms and pathological features of the rats , a total success rate of 83 % was achieved by the treatment. Furthermore , the improvement of joint<symptom> symptoms<symptom> was more obvious when methotrexate and MSC transplantation were used. In summary , it was concluded that MSC transplantation relieved the symptoms of arthritis<disease> by down-regulating the expression of COMP on the synovial membrane and in the serum of CIA rats.
