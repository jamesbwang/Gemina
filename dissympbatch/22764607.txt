  Headache<symptom> secondary to sinonasal disease is still overestimated in the diagnostic pathway of cephalalgia. Contrary to belief , so-called sinus headaches<symptom> are fairly uncommon and seen mostly in acute sinusitis<disease> or acute exacerbations. Even though literature has written extensively about the prevalence of migraines in self-diagnosed or primary care-diagnosed sinus headache<symptom> , there is only a small body of literature regarding the real prevalence of pain and headache<symptom> occurring during acute and chronic sinusitis.We reviewed the current literature and clarified the differences in presentation of pain for acute and chronic sinusitis<disease> , highlighting the higher prevalence of pain in chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps versus with polyps. Furthermore , we stressed the need for a rethinking in the clinical diagnosis of sinusitis<disease> based on pain as a major symptom.
