  Negative pressure wound<disease> therapy ( NPWT) is a widely accepted technique to treat local infectious wounds<disease> of the skin , subcutaneous tissue , fascia , or muscle. Recently , several reports describing the efficacy of NPWT for various types of fistulas<disease> and anastomotic leaks have been published. We herein describe a patient with an open abdominal<disease> wound<disease> due to colonic anastomotic leakage and diffuse peritonitis<disease> , in whom abdominal vacuum sealing ( AVS) as a modified NPWT was useful for the management of this complex wound<disease>. A 32-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with late presenting traumatic diaphragmatic hernia and strangulated ileum complicated by necrosis<symptom> of the ileum and transverse colon. He had a history of cervical spinal cord injury due to suicide attempt 14 years earlier and , as a result of cervical spinal cord injury , he was paralyzed in the lower body. The patient underwent an urgent hernia repair and bowel resection. Postoperatively , he developed severe septic shock<symptom>. On postoperative day ( POD) 6 , wound<disease> dehiscence due to colonic anastomotic leakage with diffuse peritonitis<disease> was diagnosed , but he was unable to undergo re-operation because of refractory severe septic shock<symptom> combined with neurogenic shock<symptom> due to the cervical cord injury. The patient was treated with AVS therapy. He gradually recovered from septic shock<symptom> , and the anastomotic leakage healed after a 2-month period. The wound<disease> dehiscence was also reduced. The patient resumed oral intake on POD 112 and was discharged on POD 190. Although surgical repair would be the best method for the treatment of diffuse peritonitis<disease> due to gastrointestinal perforation or anastomotic leakage , our case suggests that AVS with ` conventional ' drainage is a treatment of choice for open abdominal<disease> wounds<disease> even in the presence of diffuse peritonitis<disease> caused by intestinal anastomotic leakage , especially in patients with poor general medical condition.
