  To evaluate the association between newborn gender and the risk for later pediatric respiratory morbidity. A population based cohort analysis was performed by comparing the risk of long-term respiratory morbidity ( until 18 years of age) according to gender. Respiratory morbidity included hospitalizations involving pneumonia<disease> , asthma , bronchitis<symptom> , bronchiolitis<disease> , upper respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( URTI) , influenza<disease> , and bronchiectasis. Deliveries occurred between the years 1991 and 2014 in a tertiary medical center. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed to compare cumulative respiratory morbidity. A Cox proportional hazards model controlled for confounders. During the study period 240953 newborns met the inclusion criteria. Among them , 118113 were females ( 49.0 %) and 122840 were males ( 51.0 %). During the 18 years of follow-up , 13719 ( 5.7 %) different newborns were hospitalized with respiratory related morbidity. Males had significantly higher rates of respiratory morbidity as compared with females ( 6.4 % vs 4.9 % respectively , P < 0.001 , OR 1.32 , 95 % CI 1.28-1.37). Specifically , pneumonia<disease> , bronchitis<symptom> , asthma , bronchiolitis<disease> , and URTI were significantly more common in males. Males exhibited higher total cumulative respiratory morbidity ( log rank P < 0.001) , as well as higher cumulative morbidity in several sub-categories. These sub-categories included pneumonia<disease> , bronchitis<symptom> , asthma , bronchiolitis<disease> , and URTI ( P < 0.05 in all). The Cox regression model demonstrated male gender to be an independent risk factor for pediatric respiratory morbidity while adjusting for gestational age , birthweight , and other confounders ( HR 1.29 , 95 % CI 1.25-1.34 , P < 0.001). Males are at an increased risk for pediatric respiratory morbidity , independent of obstetrical characteristics such as gestational age and birthweight.
