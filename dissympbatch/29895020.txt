  To assess the feasibility and efficacy of intensity-modulated radiation implemented with helical tomotherapy image-guided with daily megavoltage computed tomography for head and neck cancer. Between May 2010 and May 2013 , 72 patients were treated with curative intent. The median age was 64 years , with 57 % undergoing definitive and 43 % postoperative radiotherapy. Primary tumour sites were oral cavity ( 21 %) , oropharynx ( 26 %) , hypopharynx ( 20 %) , larynx ( 22 %) , and others ( 11 %). Staging included 4 % stage I , 15 % II , 26 % III , 48 % IVa , and 7 % IVb. Radiotherapy was combined with chemotherapy in 64 %. Primary endpoint was locoregional control , and secondary endpoints survival and toxicity. Median follow-up was 20 months , with 11 locoregional recurrences. Three-year disease-free survival was 58 % and overall survival 57 %. In the multivariate analysis , age under 64 years , no extracapsular extension , postoperative radiotherapy , induction chemotherapy , and non-oral cavity tumour were significant favourable prognostic factors for disease-free-survival. The overall incidence of acute grade ≥ 3 toxicities were mucositis 32 % , pain 11 % , xerostomia 7 % , dysphagia<symptom> 53 % , radiodermatitis 44 % , and osteonecrosis 1 %. Late grade ≥ 3 toxicities were fibrosis<disease> 6 % , dysphagia<symptom> 21 % , fistula<disease> 1 % , and skin<symptom> necrosis<symptom> 1 %. Intensity-modulated radiation with helical tomotherapy achieved respectable locoregional control and overall survival , with acceptable toxicity , in head and neck cancer patients.
