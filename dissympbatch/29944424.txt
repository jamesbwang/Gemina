  The genetic skin condition , epidermolysis bullosa ( EB) causes the skin<symptom> to be fragile and blister. As a result , blisters need to be lanced and the skin needs to be dressed with specialist dressings for protection and to promote wound<disease> healing. a prospective case series and product evaluation of the Allevyn â„¢ Gentle Border Lite dressing range was conducted , with four paediatric patients diagnosed with the following types of EB: recessive dystrophic ( generalised severe) , dominant dystrophic , simplex ( generalised severe) and junctional ( localised). Specialist EB nurses at Birmingham Children 's Hospital conducted the evaluation and compiled the case series. Management and outcomes: clinical , patient and health economic outcomes were captured. The outcomes reported suggest an increase in dressing time wear and a reduction in dressing changes when comparing Allevyn Gentle Border Lite dressings to the patient 's regular foam dressing regime. Furthermore , a cost saving measure could be shown. this small case series suggests that the use of the Allevyn Gentle Border Lite dressing range can positively impact the clinical , patient and health economic outcomes of paediatric EB patients.
