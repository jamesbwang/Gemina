  To assess the safety and efficacy of super-mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( SMP) in the treatment of symptomatic lower pole renal stones ( LPSs) after the failure of shockwave lithotripsy ( SWL) or retrograde intrarenal surgery ( RIRS) , we retrospectively evaluated 44 patients with symptomatic LPSs with previously failed SWL or RIRS and consequently underwent SMP from October 2014 to March 2016. The percutaneous renal access was performed 12-14F with C-arm fluoroscopy or ultrasonographic guidance. Stone disintegration was performed using either Holmium laser or pneumatic lithotripter. Perioperative parameters along with operations were assessed in detail. A total of 44 patients ( mean age 49.1 ± 13.7 years) were included in the study. Stone size was 18.4 ± 6.0 mm ( range 9-29) , operative time was 63.9 ± 32.7 min ( range 14-145) and hospital stay was 2.8 ± 1.2 days ( range 1-5). The hemoglobin drop was 12.4 ± 8.8 g/L ( range 0-31) , and no patients required blood transfusion. Complete stone-free status was achieved in 40 ( 90.9 %) patients. Clinically insignificant residual fragments were observed in three ( 6.8 %) patients and only one ( 2.3 %) patient had a 6 mm residual calculus. A total of three minor complications ( urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> , hemorrhage<symptom> resolved by hemostatics and renal colic requiring analgesics) were observed postoperatively. For symptomatic LPSs after the failure of SWL or RIRS , SMP is a safe and efficient auxiliary option and even might be an alternative to SWL or RIRS , while further considering the stone-free rates and stone-related events.
