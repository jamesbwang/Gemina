  OBJECTIVE To characterize and identify factors associated with intraoperative and postoperative complications of maxillectomy in dogs with oral tumors. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. ANIMALS 193 dogs that underwent maxillectomy for oral tumor excision from 2000 through 2011. PROCEDURES Data were extracted from the medical records regarding dog signalment , tumor location and size , histologic findings , clinical stage , maxillectomy category , surgical approach , and additional treatments provided. These factors were examined for associations with recorded intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS The most common intraoperative complication was excessive surgical bleeding ( 103/193 ( 53.4 %)) , for which 44 ( 42.7 %) dogs received an intraoperative blood transfusion. These outcomes were both significantly associated with tumor size and location , maxillectomy type , and surgical approach. Dogs treated with a dorsolateral combined intraoral surgical approach were more likely to have excessive surgical bleeding ( 48/58 ( 83 %)) and had a longer mean duration of surgery ( 106 minutes) than those treated with an intraoral approach ( 29/54 ( 54 %) and 77 minutes , respectively). Complications developing within 48 hours after surgery included epistaxis<symptom> ( 99/193 ( 51.3 %)) , excessive facial swelling ( 71/193 ( 36.8 %)) , facial pawing ( 21/193 ( 10.9 %)) , and difficulty eating ( 22/193 ( 11.4 %)). Complications developing within 48 hours to 4 weeks after surgery included lip trauma ( 22/164 ( 13.4 %)) , oronasal fistula<disease> formation ( 18/164 ( 11.0 %)) , wound<disease> dehiscence ( 18/164 ( 11.0 %)) , and infection ( 13/164 ( 7.9 %)). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Complications associated with maxillectomy in dogs were generally minor. Aggressive surgical planning , preparedness for hemorrhage<symptom> and transfusion , careful tissue dissection , and comprehensive pain control are recommended , particularly for dogs with large , caudally located oral tumors requiring extensive excision.
