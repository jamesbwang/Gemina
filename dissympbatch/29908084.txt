  We aimed to define the clinical features , outcome , and prognostic factors for extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma ( ENKTL) patients in Taiwan. We retrospectively reviewed 101 ENKTL patients diagnosed between February 1998 and October 2015. The median age of 101 patients was 52 years old ( range 22-85); 76.2 % of patients were Ann Arbor stage I/II disease. The 5-year progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) were 49.9 % and 54.8 % , respectively. Patients with log ( EBV-DNA) ≥ 3.8 and bone<disease> marrow hemophagocytosis at diagnosis had inferior PFS and OS. Most stage I/II patients received combined chemoradiotherapy with anthracycline-containing regimen , with overall response rate of 96.7 % , complete response rate 86.9 % , 5-year PFS 65 % , and OS 72 %. The relapse rate was 29.3 % with a short median disease-free survival of 6.2 months. In advanced stage patients , overall response rate was only 13.6 % , with median PFS 2.3 months , and OS 4.8 months. Age ≥ 60 ( HR 3.773 , 95 % CI 1.733-8.215 , P = 0.001) and stage III/IV ( HR 7.785 , 95 % CI 2.312-26.213 , P = 0.001) were unfavorable prognostic factors for PFS and OS by multivariate analyses. Age ≥ 60 and stage III/IV are independent poor prognostic factors for PFS and OS. Early-stage ENKTL patients had good response to combined chemoradiotherapy with anthracycline-containing regimen but with a high relapse rate and short disease-free survival. Anthracycline-containing regimen in advanced stage had poor<symptom> response<symptom> and dismal outcome.
