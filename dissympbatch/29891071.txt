  Hormonal disorders are a source of cerebellar ataxia<symptom> in both children and adults. Normal development of the cerebellum is critically dependent on thyroid hormone , which crosses both the blood-brain barrier and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier thanks to specific transporters , including monocarboxylate transporter 8 and the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1C1. In particular , growth and dendritic arborization of Purkinje neurons , synaptogenesis , and myelination are dependent on thyroid hormone. Disturbances of thyroid hormone may also impact on cerebellar ataxias<symptom> of other origin , decompensating or aggravating the pre-existing ataxia<symptom> manifesting with motor ataxia<symptom> , oculomotor ataxia<symptom> , and/or Schmahmann syndrome<disease>. Parathyroid disorders are associated with a genuine cerebellar syndrome<disease> , but symptoms may be subtle. The main conditions combining diabetes and cerebellar ataxia<symptom> are Friedreich ataxia<symptom> , ataxia<symptom> associated with anti-GAD antibodies , autoimmune polyglandular syndromes<disease> , aceruloplasminemia , and cerebellar ataxia<symptom> associated with hypogonadism ( especially Holmes ataxia/Boucher-Neuh√§user syndrome<disease>). The general workup of cerebellar disorders should include the evaluation of hormonal status , including thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels , and hormonal replacement should be considered depending on the laboratory results. Cerebellar deficits may be reversible in some cases.
