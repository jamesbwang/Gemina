  Many patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhages<symptom> ( ICHs) undergo endotracheal intubation with subsequent mechanical ventilation ( MV) for `` airway protection '' with the intent to prevent aspiration , pneumonias<disease> , and its related mortality. Conversely , these procedures may independently promote pneumonia<disease> , laryngeal trauma , dysphagia<symptom> , and adversely affect patient outcomes. The net benefit of intubation and MV in this patient cohort has not been systematically investigated. We conducted a large single-center observational cohort study to examine the independent association between endotracheal intubation and MV , hospital-acquired pneumonia<disease> ( HAP) , and in-hospital mortality ( HM) in patients with ICH. All consecutive patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of a spontaneous ICH to a tertiary care hospital in Boston , Massachusetts , from June 2000 through January 2014 , who were ≥ 18 years of age and hospitalized for ≥ 2 days were eligible for inclusion. Patients with pneumonia<disease> on admission , or those having brain or lung neoplasms were excluded. Our exposure of interest was endotracheal intubation and MV during hospitalization; our primary outcomes were incidence of HAP and HM , ascertained using International Classification of Diseases-9 and administrative discharge disposition codes , respectively , in patients who underwent endotracheal intubation and MV versus those who did not. Multivariable logistic regression was used to control for confounders. Of the 2,386 hospital admissions screened , 1,384 patients fulfilled study criteria and were included in the final analysis. A total of 507 ( 36.6 %) patients were intubated. Overall 133 ( 26.23 %) patients in the intubated group developed HAP versus 41 ( 4.67 %) patients in the non-intubated group ( p < 0.0001); 195 ( 38.5 %) intubated patients died during hospitalization compared to 48 ( 5.5 %) non-intubated patients ( p < 0.0001). After confounder adjustments , OR for HAP and HM , were 4.23 ( 95 % CI 2.48-7.22; p < 0.0001) and 4.32 ( 95 % CI 2.5-7.49; p < 0.0001) with c-statistics of 0.79 and 0.89 , in the intubated versus non-intubated patients , respectively. In this large hospital-based cohort of patients presenting with an acute spontaneous ICH , endotracheal intubation and MV were associated with increased odds of HAP and HM. These findings urge further examination of the practice of intubation in prospective studies.
