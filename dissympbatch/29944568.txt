  There is a paucity of studies that report complication rates following a subcranial Le Fort III advancement using distraction osteogenesis. The purpose of this study was to identify and describe serious postoperative complications following Le Fort III advancement with distraction osteogenesis , and provide strategies to assist in the resolution of these complications. An observational retrospective study was performed on consecutive patients with Apert , Crouzon , or Pfeiffer syndromes<disease> ( n = 16) who underwent Le Fort III advancement using distraction osteogenesis between 2008 and 2017. Serious complications were defined as frontal bone loss , cerebrospinal fluid leak , meningitis<disease> , seizures<symptom> , or major blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( ie , massive transfusion within the first postoperative day). Three ( 18.7 %) patients presented serious complications , namely cerebrospinal fluid leak ( n = 1; 6.2 %) , seizures<symptom> ( n = 1; 6.2 %) due to a halo-type device trans-pin intracranial migration , and major blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( n = 1; 6.2 %). Adopting well-delineated interventions , all of these complications were resolved without fatality. A Le Fort III advancement has a significant morbidity rate , with 3 of our patients ( 18.7 %) in this study presenting serious complications. Appropriate management reduced this morbidity , and all complications were resolved without fatality.
