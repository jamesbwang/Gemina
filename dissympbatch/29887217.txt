  The dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia<symptom> syndrome<disease> ( DCMA) is a rare mitochondrial disorder characterized by progressive cardiomyopathy , prolonged QT interval and early death in childhood related to intractable heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. We present a case series of 9 children with DCMA who demonstrated functional improvement and favourable left ventricular remodeling only after digoxin was added to their medical therapy. A retrospective review of 46 patients with DCMA followed at the Alberta Children 's Hospital from 2005 to 2017 identified 9 patients who were treated with digoxin and had serial echocardiography data. For each subject , we calculated the difference between baseline and follow-up for left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) , end-diastolic dimension ( LVEDD) , and end-systolic dimension ( LVESD) as determined by echocardiography. Patients were on average 45.6 ± 59 months of age when digoxin was started with a mean LVEF of 40 % ± 11 % when digoxin was started. Seven patients were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEIs) at the time of initiation of digoxin , and all were on β-receptor antagonists ( BB). After being on digoxin for a mean of 11.7 ± 10.9 months , average LVEF improved to 55 % ± 10 % ( P = 0.0005) , and there were significant decreases in the Z-scores for LVEDD ( +2.1 ± 1.9 to +0.65 ± 1.4 , P = 0.02) and LVESD ( +3.83 ± 2.07 to +1.79 ± 1.76 , P = 0.01). In children with DCMA , we report that digoxin seems to have additive beneficial properties when combined with ACEI and BB therapy. This novel observation may have implications for the medical treatment of mitochondrial cardiomyopathies.
