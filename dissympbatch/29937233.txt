  Cocaine use in Australia is increasing , with approximately 2.5 % of the surveyed population having used cocaine. In the USA , levamisole , a widely used anti-helminthic veterinary drug has been increasingly detected as a cutting agent in cocaine seizures<symptom>. Levamisole is known to cause agranulocytosis in humans. We ascertained the prevalence of levamisole-adulterated cocaine , detectable in the urine from patients that had undergone a pathology request for a urine drug screen. We assayed routinely requested urines<disease> that were positive for cocaine on immunoassay with liquid chromatography high resolution quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry ( LC-QToF). We investigated available urine samples from a period of 2 years that had a positive result for cocaine. In addition , we examined samples that were below the cut-off for cocaine on immunoassay. Specimens were analysed for the presence of levamisole and other ` unknown ' drugs. In the period under investigation the laboratory examined 3665 urine samples for cocaine: 1.4 % ( n = 51) of the samples were positive for cocaine by immunoassay and half of these ( n = 26 , 51 %) were further examined by LC-QToF. In addition , we examined 10 samples that were negative by immunoassay ( as defined by AS/NZS 4308:2008). Levamisole was detected in the urine of cocaine users in approximately 75 % of cases. Other illicit drugs were also frequently found in this cohort. The most common illicit drugs detected were methamphetamine , ecstasy and cannabis. Australian cocaine is widely adulterated with levamisole. Cocaine users are at risk of levamisole related health problems in addition to the problems related to cocaine.
