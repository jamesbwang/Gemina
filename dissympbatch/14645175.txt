  We present a minimal skin wound<disease> abdominal myomectomy performed in our hospital and attempt to identify the optimal range of this technique by considering the characteristics of target leiomyomas. In this procedure , we attempted to make the skin wound<disease> as small as possible , with a maximum length of approximately 5 cm. In addition to introducing the minimal skin wound<disease> abdominal myomectomy , we retrospectively collected and analyzed the medical records of 76 patients treated with minimal skin wound<disease> abdominal myomectomy exclusively by the same physician at Maruyama Memorial General Hospital between January 2007 and December 2016. We statistically investigated relationships between ten factors , including body mass index; patient 's age; patient 's parity; administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue; presence of anemia<symptom> the uterine leiomyomas ' number , size , weight , and location; operation time; and blood<symptom> loss<symptom>. First , we introduce a case in which we performed minimal skin wound<disease> abdominal myomectomy for a 36-year-old Japanese patient with a large leiomyoma ( 10 cm in diameter). Then , we assessed the impacts of patient characteristics and leiomyoma characteristics on operation time and blood<symptom> loss<symptom> for this surgical method. In a multivariate analysis , only the number of resected leiomyomas significantly affected massive bleeding. Other factors showed no difference on operation time and the amount of blood<symptom> loss<symptom>. Minimal skin wound<disease> abdominal myomectomy is safe and effective for use in many patients , because only the number of leiomyomas affects the amount of blood<symptom> loss<symptom>. No other factor affected operation time. We suggest the possibility that the expanded use of minimal skin wound<disease> abdominal myomectomy may reduce the number of patients waiting for long periods to undergo laparoscopic surgery and may optimize the use of medical resources in rural areas.
