  Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn ( PPHN) is a complication of several respiratory<disease> diseases<disease> characterized by an elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance with resultant right-to-left shunting of blood and severe hypoxemia<symptom> in the neonatal period. PPHN carries a high rate of morbidity and mortality , particularly in limited-resource settings ( low-income and/or developing country). Echocardiography remains the gold standard for diagnosis of PPHN. Modern therapies such as inhaled nitric oxide , high-frequency oscillatory ventilation , extracorporeal membrane oxygenation , and/or other pulmonary vasodilators agents can reduce the mortality rate of PPHN. Unfortunately , echocardiography and the use of these modern therapies are often difficult for a medical institution to provide for patients in developing countries , even when a timely diagnosis of PPHN has been made. In this review , the practical challenges of timely diagnosis of PPHN and efficient use of available treatment options faced by pediatricians or neonatologists in limited-resource settings are discussed.
