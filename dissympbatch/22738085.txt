  Acute ethanol intoxication has been shown to have contrasting effects on outcomes in sepsis<disease>. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of acute ethanol intoxication on hemodynamics , renal function , brain perfusion and lactate/pyruvate in an ovine sepsis<disease> model. Anesthetized , mechanically ventilated female sheep were randomized to an ethanol group ( n = 7) , which received 1 g/kg ethanol diluted in intravenous ( i.v.) saline infusion or a control group ( n = 7) , which received the same volume of i.v. saline. Both groups received the treatment for a period of 2 h prior to induction of sepsis<disease> by intraperitoneal injection of feces. Other treatment included fluid resuscitation but no vasopressors or antibiotics. Global hemodynamics , renal blood flow , brain cortex laser Doppler flowmetry and microdialysis analyses were recorded hourly. In the ethanol group , blood ethanol concentrations were 137 Â± 29 mg/dL at the time of feces injection and decreased to become undetectable by 12 h. Arterial hypotension<symptom> occurred earlier in the ethanol than in the control group ( 8 ( 7-12) vs. 14 ( 11-20) hours , p = 0.03). Lactate levels increased to > 2 mmol/L earlier in the ethanol group. Renal dysfunction ( 9 ( 6-13) vs. 13 ( 12-15) hours , p = 0.05) and oliguria ( urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/h; 10 ( 7-12) vs. 13 ( 12 , 13) hours , p = 0.01) developed earlier in the ethanol than in the control group. Brain blood flow and lactate/pyruvate were unaffected. There was no significant difference in survival time. Acute ethanol intoxication in this model of peritonitis<disease> resulted in earlier development of shock<symptom> and renal dysfunction but did not alter brain perfusion and metabolism or short-term survival.
