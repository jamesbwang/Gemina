  Venous thrombo-embolic events ( VTE) frequently occur in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC) and contribute to high morbidity and mortality. To determine whether VTE biomarkers are related to cancer , inflammation<symptom> or precancerous states and to assess their relevance to predict VTE in PDAC. We compared VTE biomarkers in patients with PDAC ( Factor VIII , D-dimers , von Willebrand factor , free tissue factor pathway inhibitor and microvesicle-tissue factor ( MV-TF) activity were higher in PDAC patients compared to patients with IPMN or chronic pancreatitis<disease> PDAC patients with metastasis presented higher D-dimers and MV-TF activity compared to patients with localized lesions<symptom> , but elevation of D-dimers was dependent on tumor size. In multivariate analysis , elevated D-dimers ( ≥ 2.16 µg/mL) or MV-TF activity ( ≥ 2.37 pg/mL) were significant risk factors for VTE in PDAC patients , after adjustment for age and sex ( HR 4.9 ( 1.0-23.1) or HR 10.5 ( 1.5-72.4) , mean ( interquartile range) , respectively). Cumulative probability of VTE at 6 months was higher in patients with elevated D-dimers ( 56.3 % vs 15.6 % , VTE biomarkers including D-dimers and MV-TF activity are not related to inflammation<symptom> but rather to cancer process and dissemination. D-dimers and MV-TF activity are associated to future VTE in PDAC patients and could help identify patients who could benefit from thromboprophylaxis.
