  Venous thrombosis is recognized as one of the most important complications of nephrotic syndrome<disease> ( NS). In patients with NS , venous thrombosis may develop in the renal veins , the deep veins of the lower limb , and the inferior vena cava. Here , we describe a case report of an NS patient with multiple venous thrombosis in the right<symptom> renal vein , the left iliac vein , the vena cava inferior , the right atrium , and the pulmonary arteries. Moreover , we describe the successful treatment of multiple venous thrombosis with prolonged thrombolytic treatment in spite of an increased risk of bleeding due to renal biopsy.
