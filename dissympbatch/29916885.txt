  Immediate single-stage direct-to-implant breast reconstruction requires caution owing to the possibility of skin<symptom> necrosis<symptom> and implant failure. Nevertheless , this method has been performed widely for breast reconstruction. This study aimed to analyze the safety of single-stage implant reconstruction by comparing it with 2-stage reconstruction ( TSR). Immediate single-stage reconstructions ( SSRs) and TSRs with a tissue expander , performed from January 2011 to December 2016 , were retrospectively reviewed. Acellular dermal matrix was used in both groups to maintain similar pocket conditions. Risk factors were not considered in patient selection. We enrolled 290 patients including 8 who received bilateral breast reconstruction. A total of 298 breasts<disease> were operated , including 233 SSR cases ( 78 %) and 65 TSR cases ( 22 %). The surgical success ( ie , the implant was maintained without explantation) rate was higher in SSR ( 97 %) than in TSR ( 90.2 %) ( P = 0.03). Two-stage reconstruction had a significantly higher rate of hematoma ( 12.3 % vs 3.4 % , P = 0.005) , seroma ( 41.5 % vs 20.6 % , P = 0.001) , and implant failure ( 9.8 % vs 3.0 % , P = 0.03). However , the rate of skin<symptom> necrosis<symptom> was lower in TSR ( 7.7 % vs 10.3 %) with a trend toward significance ( P = 0.053). The implant salvage rate was higher in SSR ( 61.1 %) than in TSR ( 12.5 %) even after revision operation ( P = 0.013). Single-stage reconstruction yielded a lower complication rate than TSR. Moreover , the high salvage rate of SSR causes less concern about implant failure despite the possibility of revision operation. Therefore , SSR may be considered a frontline method for breast reconstruction without any patient selection interference.
