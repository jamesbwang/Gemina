  Two new series of pyrazolo ( 3,4-d) pyrimidine bearing thiazolidinone moiety were designed and synthesized. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro ( COX-1 and COX-2) inhibitory assay. Compounds that showed promising COX-2 selectivity were further subjected to in vivo anti-inflammatory screening applying formalin induced paw edema<symptom> ( acute model) and cotton-pellet induced granuloma<disease> ( chronic model) assays using celecoxib and diclofenac sodium as reference drugs. The histopathological and ulcerogenic potential were also determined. In vivo anti-inflammatory data showed that compounds 2 , 6 , 7d displayed anti-inflammatory activity higher than both references in the formalin induced paw edema<symptom> model. On the other hand , compounds 2 , 3d , 3e , 7b and 7d displayed anti-inflammatory activity greater than or nearly equivalent to diclofenac sodium in the cotton pellet-induced granuloma<disease> assay. Moreover , most of the tested compounds revealed good gastrointestinal safety profile. Collectively , compounds 2 and 7d were considered as promising candidates in managing both acute and chronic inflammation<symptom> with safe gastrointestinal margin.
