  Although sheep farming has grown in the state of Acre over the past four decades , little is known about occurrences of helminthiases in the herds of this region. The objective of the study was to assess the occurrences of non-intestinal helminthiasis among sheep slaughtered in Rio Branco. A total of 110 sheep livers were inspected from two slaughter batches ( july 2014 and march 2015) in a slaughterhouse in Rio Branco. Livers with macroscopic lesions<symptom> were photographed and were then subjected to histopathological analysis under an optical microscope. The macroscopic lesions<symptom> showed small nodes with inflammatory characteristics and areas of fibrosis<disease> , which appeared to be calcified , thus suggesting a granulomatous reaction. Of the 110 evaluated livers , we noticed 110 nodules<symptom> in total; these nodules<symptom> have an average size of 0.5 cm. The histopathological analysis showed alterations to the architecture of the hepatic lobe , with multiple foci of necrosis<symptom> and polymorphonuclear cells. Two samples revealed the presence of helminths from Nematode class and Capillaria sp. eggs identified by the typical morphology and morphometry. This seems to be the first report of Capillaria sp. in sheep livers in Brazil , and it serves as an important alert regarding animal health surveillance and control and regarding the Capillaria sp. zoonotic role in humans.
