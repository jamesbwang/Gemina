  Predicting outcomes in patients with soft tissue sarcoma<disease> ( STS) is challenging. To improve these predictions , we retrospectively analyzed common nutritional assessment systems , including Glasgow prognostic score ( GPS) , Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index ( GNRI) , neutrophil ⁻ lymphocyte<symptom> ratio ( NLR) , platelet ⁻ lymphocyte<symptom> ratio ( PLR) , and controlling nutritional ( CONUT) score against outcomes in 103 patients with STS , of whom 15 ( 14.6 %) died within 1 year of diagnosis. GPS , GNRI , NLR , PLR , and CONUT scores significantly differed between patients who died within one year and patients who lived longer. Binomial logistic regression analysis showed that male sex , older age at diagnosis , higher GPS , higher stage , and unresectable STS were risk factors for death within a year of diagnosis. Overall survival was evaluated by Cox proportional hazards models , which correlated higher NLR , higher PLR , larger maximum diameter of tumor , higher stage , and unresectable STS with poor prognosis. We next examined prognostic factors in the 93 patients with resectable STS , and found male sex , higher GPS , and higher stage were correlated with poor prognosis in these patients. Our findings suggest that GPS , NLR , and PLR are simple predictors of outcome in patients with STS. Nutritional therapies might improve their GPS and prognosis.
