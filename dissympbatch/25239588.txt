  The aim of the present study was to investigate the computed tomography ( CT) manifestations of Wegener granulomatosis ( WG) in the chest and potential reasons for misdiagnosis. Conventional CT scans and clinical data of 45 patients with WG were retrospectively analyzed. Patients typically presented with multiple system involvement , primarily in the upper and lower respiratory<disease> tract<symptom>. The incidence of thoracic involvement was 75.56 % ( 34/45). Radiographic features were varied between cases in the present study , with the most common features being numerous cavitary nodules<symptom> and masses in the lungs. Cavitations were usually irregular , with uneven wall thickness , partial centrality , fuzzy inner edges and piecemeal necrosis<symptom>. These results indicate that WG typically has multiple system involvement , with the chest being most prominent. Multiple variable-sized cavitary nodules<symptom> with irregular edges and piecemeal necrosis<symptom> were the most notable features revealed using CT scanning; however , in order to give a definitive diagnosis , biopsies should be performed.
