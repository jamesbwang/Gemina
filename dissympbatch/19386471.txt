  Focal Dermal Hypoplasia ( FDH) or Goltz-Gorlin syndrome<disease> is an unusual X-linked dominant syndrome<disease> characterised by anomalies of both ectodermal and mesodermal structures. We present a case report on the management of a 58 year old Caucasian male with Focal Dermal Hypoplasia. This report describes an additional clinical manifestation of an intraosseous mandibular lipoma , which has not been previously described in cases of FDH. Intraosseous lipomas in the head and neck region are reported in only seventeen cases in isolation of any associated syndrome<disease>. Diagnosis was hindered due to similitude with Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome<disease> ( Gorlin-Goltz Syndrome<disease>) which despite similar nomenclature , is an exclusively separate condition This novel finding encourages clinicians to consider unusual differential diagnoses in such cases and highlights the importance of avoiding eponyms to prevent confusion<symptom> with similar conditions.
