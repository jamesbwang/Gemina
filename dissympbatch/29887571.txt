  Dry eye<disease> syndrome<disease> is defined as a disorder of the tear film caused by either a decreased production in tears or a disruption to the stability of the complex tear film , which causes damage to the ocular surface. It has been developed the medicine for dry<symptom> eye<disease> syndrome<disease> focusing anti-inflammation or mucin secretion , however , no treatment has been developed focusing on the effect of elevation of the lacrimal secretion. We recently identified that pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide ( PACAP)- null mice develop dry eye-like symptoms such as corneal keratinization and tear reduction. PACAP receptor ( PAC1-R) immunoreactivity was observed in the acinar cells of the mouse lacrimal gland. PACAP eye drop significantly stimulated tear secretion level , and the effect was suppressed by pretreatment with PAC1-R antagonist or adenylate cyclase inhibitor. PACAP eye drop on the PACAP KO mouse significantly increased the tear secretion , and continuous eye drop suppressed progression of the corneal keratinization. PACAP eye drops increase aquaporin 5 ( AQP5) levels in the membrane of acinar cells in lacrimal glands. AQP5 siRNA treatment significantly attenuates PACAP-induced tear secretion. Based on these results , PACAP might be clinically useful to treat dry eye disorder.
