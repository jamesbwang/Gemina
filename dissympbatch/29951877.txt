  Maternal health and nutritional status influence offspring health and the diseases that may develop in them. The effects of maternal inflammation<symptom> on offspring from the perspective of the inflammatory response and immune changes are not fully understood. We hypothesized that maternal inflammation<symptom> modulates immune and metabolic functions , affecting the pathophysiology of inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> in offspring. This study investigated whether maternal inflammation<symptom> affects the onset of collagen-induced arthritis<disease> ( CIA) , a murine model of human rheumatoid arthritis<disease>. Female DBA/1J mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) 5 days before conception. Male offspring of LPS-treated dams were placed in the maternal LPS group ( MLG). To induce CIA , type II collagen ( CII) was emulsified with Freund 's complete adjuvant and injected twice into each mouse , at 13 and 16 weeks. The offspring were sacrificed at 26 weeks to analyze immunological and metabolic parameters. The degree of joint<symptom> swelling at an early stage of CIA was lower in the MLG than in the control group. From histological analysis , the severity of joint destruction ( severity of arthritis<disease> score) and CII-specific IgG titer were significantly lower in the MLG. However , at 26 weeks , serum interleukin ( IL) -6 levels , an index of CIA disease activity , were significantly higher in the MLG. Moreover , serum leptin levels were lower in the MLG , and a negative correlation between leptin and serum IL-6 was observed. In conclusion , maternal inflammation<symptom> does not merely suppress inflammation<symptom>; it may delay CIA in offspring. The analysis of inflammatory cytokines and leptin concentrations at 26 weeks suggests that the pathophysiology of arthritis<disease> was worsening. This study also suggests that maternal inflammation<symptom> modulates postnatal inflammatory response patterns in offspring.
