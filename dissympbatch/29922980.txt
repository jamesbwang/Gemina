  The management of distal radius fractures needs to be adapted to the increasingly complex traumas in patients with greater functional requirements. The goal remains to restore normal anatomy in order to preserve function. A pre-operative assessment using x-rays and thin-slice CT scans with three-dimensional reconstructions enables the best possible understanding of the fracture prior to surgery and planning of the pre-operative strategy. Arthroscopy is a technique that allows visualisation of the bone fragments and their displacement , as well as their reduction. It is the only tool that allows diagnostic and prognostic assessment of the associated injuries. Arthroscopy is the gold standard for identifying and grading scapholunate injuries. It allows treatment of the lesions<symptom> where necessary and a dynamic appreciation of the stability of the osteosynthesis. Recognition of articular fragmentation patterns and instability features can therefore aid treatment choice to prevent poor outcomes due to malunion and degenerative arthritis<disease>. We recommend arthroscopic-assisted internal fixation for articular fractures for any active patient , not only for young adults , displaced or a gap by more than 2 mm , potential scapholunate ligament injuries , and fractures of the ulnar styloid. A strong initial learning and a minimal experience are recommended to avoid the complications of this invaluable procedure.
