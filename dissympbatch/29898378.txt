  Osteoarthritis ( OA) is characterized by synovitis<symptom> and synovial fibrosis<disease>. Synoviocytes are fibroblast-like resident cells of the synovium that are activated by TGF-Î² to proliferate , migrate and produce extracellular matrix. Synoviocytes secrete hyaluronan ( HA) and proteoglycan-4 ( PRG4). HA reduced synovial fibrosis<disease> in vivo and the Prg4
