  Cellular membranes<symptom> are maintained as closed compartments , broken up only transiently during membrane reorganization or lipid transportation. However , open-ended membranes<symptom> , likely derived from scissions of the endoplasmic reticulum , persist in vaccinia<disease> virus-infected cells during the assembly of the viral envelope. A group of viral membrane assembly proteins ( VMAPs) were identified as essential for this process. To understand the mechanism of VMAPs , we determined the 2.2-Ã… crystal structure of the largest member , named A6 , which is a soluble protein with two distinct domains. The structure of A6 displays a novel protein fold composed mainly of alpha helices. The larger C-terminal domain forms a unique cage that encloses multiple glycerophospholipids with a lipid bilayer-like configuration. The smaller N-terminal domain does not bind lipid but negatively affects lipid binding by A6. Mutations of key hydrophobic residues lining the lipid-binding cage disrupt lipid binding and abolish viral replication. Our results reveal a protein modality for enclosing the lipid bilayer and provide molecular insight into a viral machinery involved in generating and/or stabilizing open-ended
