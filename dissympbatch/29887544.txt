  N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP) has been used for risk stratification in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> or acute coronary syndrome<disease> , but the beyond 5-year predictive value of NT-proBNP for stroke remains an unsettled issue in Asian patients. The aim of the present study was to clarify this point.Methods and Results: We followed 1,198 participants ( 33.4 % men; mean age , 60.5 ± 11.1 years old) in the Japanese general population for a median of 13.0 years. A first stroke occurred in 93 participants. Referencing previous reports , we stratified participants according to NT-proBNP 30.0 , 55.0 , and 125.0 pg/mL. Using the NT-proBNP < 30.0 pg/mL group as a reference , adjusted HR for stroke ( 95 % CI) in the NT-proBNP 30.0-54.9-pg/ mL , 55.0-124.9-pg/ mL , and ≥ 125.0-pg/ mL groups were 1.92 ( 0.94-3.94) , 1.77 ( 0.85-3.66) , and 1.99 ( 0.86-4.61) , respectively. With the maximum follow-up period set at 5 years , the hazard ratio of the NT-proBNP ≥ 125.0-pg/ mL group compared with the < 30.0-pg/ mL group increased significantly ( HR , 4.51; 95 % CI: 1.03-19.85). On extension of the maximum follow-up period , however , the association between NT-proBNP and stroke risk weakened. NT-proBNP was significantly associated with an elevated stroke risk. Given , however , that the predictive power decreased with the number of years after NT-proBNP measurement , NT-proBNP should be re-evaluated periodically in Asian patients.
