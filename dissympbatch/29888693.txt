  Otitis<disease> media<disease> with effusion<symptom> is a clinical manifestation characterised by inflammation<symptom> of middle-ear mucosa. This study investigated the therapeutic effect of erythromycin , clarithromycin , azithromycin and roxithromycin on a histamine-induced animal model of otitis<disease> media<disease> with effusion<symptom>. The animals were divided into five groups , receiving erythromycin , clarithromycin , azithromycin , roxithromycin or saline solution. The guinea pigs in the study groups received erythromycin ( 40 mg/kg/day) , clarithromycin ( 15 mg/kg/day) , azithromycin ( 10 mg/kg/day) or roxithromycin ( 10 mg/kg/day) for 3 days by gastric tube. Four hours after the end of the administration , histamine solution was injected into the right middle ear. The lowest neutrophil density value obtained using stereological techniques was in the azithromycin group ( 0.86 ± 0.25 × 10-5/ μm3) , while the highest value was observed in the control group ( 6.68 ± 3.12 × 10-5/ μm3). The anti-inflammatory properties of clarithromycin , azithromycin and roxithromycin were similar to one another , but better than that of erythromycin. The use of macrolide antibiotics is recommended , as they show antibacterial and anti-inflammatory efficacy in otitis<disease> media<disease> with
