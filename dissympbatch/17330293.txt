  Biqi capsule is a Traditional Chinese Medicine preparation for treating rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) , and clinical studies have indicatedthat its effect may be more beneficial than that of Western medicine. The present study aimed to estimate the efficacy and safety of Biqi capsule alone or combined with methotrexate ( MTX) compared with MTX alone for treating RA by performing a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials. A systematic literature search of studies published until March 2017 was performed. References from relevant studies were screened to obtain additional articles. The results were independently evaluated for relevance , and full-text studies were assessed for eligibility. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias. Out of 558 citations that were initially retrieved , a total of 5 studies comprising 522 patients met the inclusion criteria. The risk of bias of these trials was generally unclear or high. Meta-analysis indicated that Biqi capsule had better effects on C-reactive protein ( standardized mean difference ( SMD) , -7.05; 95 % CI- ( 10.77-3.33)) and tender joint count ( SMD , -3.02; 95 % CI ,- ( 3.81-2.22)) and fewer adverse effects ( AEs) than MTX ( relative risk ( RR) , 0.19; 95 % CI , 0.08-0.43). Biqi capsule plus MTX was superior to MTX in terms of the total effect ( RR , 1.17; 95 % CI , 1.06-1.28) , rheumatoid factor ( SMD , -12.54; 95 % CI ,- ( 16.87-8.20)) , swollen joint count ( SMD , -1.50; 95 % CI ,- ( 1.99-1.01)) , score of joint<symptom> swelling ( SMD -2.07; 95 % CI ,- ( 2.76-1.38)) , tender joint count ( SMD , -2.16; 95 % CI ,- ( 2.86-1.47)) and score of joint<symptom> tenderness<symptom> ( SMD , -4.69; 95 % CI ,- ( 5.92-3.47)). There was no difference in AEs between Biqi capsule plus MTX and MTX ( RR , 0.71; 95 % CI , 0.34-1.50). In conclusion , the present study indicated that compared with MTX , Biqi capsule plus MTX appeared to have more benefits but that Biqi capsule alone was not better for RA patients than MTX. In the other words , Biqi capsule plus MTX is more effective and has fewer AEs compared to MTX. However , the trials selected in the present meta-analysis have various limitations , including the lack of blinding and the short duration of the treatment; therefore , the conclusions are not sufficiently definitive. More randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate the use of Biqi capsule for managing RA.
