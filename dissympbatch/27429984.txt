  Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the commonest histological subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and typically presents as a rapidly enlarging lymph node mass and B symptoms. It is unusual for diffuse large B cell lymphoma to present as carcinomatous polyarthritis which is a type of paraneoplastic arthritis<disease>. We present a case of a 45-year-old Asian man with diffuse large B cell lymphoma presenting with generalized lymphadenopathy<disease> , transient macular rash<symptom> , and migratory polyarthritis involving both upper and lower limb small and large joints. Treatment of the lymphoma but not the routine anti-inflammatory agents resulted in complete resolution of the arthritis<disease> suggesting the paraneoplastic nature. Poor<symptom> response<symptom> to routine therapy for inflammatory arthritis<disease> should lead to early suspicion of paraneoplastic arthritis<disease> which will prompt investigation for an underlying malignancy. Suspicion of carcinomatous polyarthritis should be made in those with migratory polyarthritis and should be thoroughly investigated to exclude underlying malignancy.
