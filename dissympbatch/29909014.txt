  Aortic<disease> aneurysms<disease> represent a major public health burden , and currently have no medical treatment options. The pathophysiology behind these aneurysms<disease> is complex and variable , depending on location and underlying cause , and generally involves progressive dysfunction of all elements of the aortic wall. Changes in smooth muscle<symptom> behavior<symptom> , endothelial signaling , extracellular matrix remodeling , and to a variable extent inflammatory signaling and cells , all contribute to the dilation of the aorta , ultimately resulting in high mortality and morbidity events including dissection and rupture. A large number of researchers have identified non-coding RNAs as crucial regulators of aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> development , both in humans and in animal models. While most work to-date has focused on microRNAs , intriguing information has also begun to emerge regarding the role of long-non-coding RNAs. This review summarizes the currently available data regarding the involvement of non-coding RNAs in aneurysmal aortopathies. Going forward , these represent key potential therapeutic targets that might be leveraged in the future to slow or prevent aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> formation , progression and rupture.
