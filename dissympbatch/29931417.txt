  To correlate patterns of Retrospective database query was performed using codes for knee MRI as well as whole-body PET-CT. Patients with malignant disease involving the knee or hardware were excluded. Patients who had both studies performed within 1 year between 2012 and 2017 were included for analysis. Knee joint osteoarthrosis , meniscal and ligamentous integrity , presence of joint effusion<symptom> , and synovitis<symptom> were assessed and recorded. Bone<disease> marrow edema<symptom> lesions<symptom> ( BMELs) were identified , segmented , and analyzed using volumetric analysis. SUVmax was assessed over the suprapatellar joint space , intercondylar notch and Hoffa 's fat pad. Symptomatic and asymptomatic knees were compared in patients with unilateral symptoms. Twenty-two cases ( 20 patients) with mean age 63.3 years ( range , 36-91 years) were included. Two patients had bilateral pain. The most FDG avid regions in both symptomatic and asymptomatic knees were the intercondylar notch ( SUVmax = 1.84 vs. 1.51) , followed by suprapatellar pouch ( SUVmax = 1.74 vs. 1.29) and Hoffa 's fat pad ( SUVmax = 1.01 vs. 0.87). SUVmax was significantly associated with cartilage loss ( mean modified Outerbridge score) ( r = 0.60 , p = 0.003) and degree of synovitis<symptom> ( r = 0.48 , p = 0023). Overall , mean SUVmax was significantly higher in the presence of a meniscal tear ( 1.83 ± 0.67 vs. 1.22 ± 0.40 , p = 0.030). Nine patients had BMELs ( volume: range = 0.6-27.8 , mean = 7.79) however there was no significant association between BMEL volume and SUVmax. Higher FDG activity correlates with intra-articular derangement and the intercondylar notch represents the most metabolically active region of the knee.
