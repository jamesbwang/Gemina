  Immunoglobulin ( Ig) G4-related pseudotumors of the liver are very rare diseases that are difficult to distinguish from malignant tumors. They can be usually improved by steroid therapy. Actinomycosis<disease> is a chronic , suppurative , granulomatous infection , for which immune suppression is a predisposing factor. It can also mimic malignant tumors. A 67-year-old man presented with mild<symptom> abdominal<symptom> discomfort<symptom> and a 5-kg weight<symptom> loss<symptom> for 3 months. Initially , he visited another hospital and was treated with antibiotics under the assumption of a liver abscess<disease> Symptom was not resolved. He diagnosed as having an IgG4-related pseudotumor of the right lobe of the liver after liver biopsy. Despite 2 months of steroid therapy , the liver mass was aggravated and invaded the right lung , as observed on follow-up computed tomography scan. We performed en bloc resection of the tumor under the assumption that it was a malignant tumor. The pathology of the tumor was revealed as actinomycotic colonies and IgG4-positive plasma cells of the liver. He recovered well and was discharged with ursodeoxycholic acid tablet for 14 days. After 3 months , he underwent postoperative follow-up CT and there was no remarkable finding in remnant left hepatic lobe. Hepatic actinomycosis<disease> and IgG4-related pseudotumors of the liver are both difficult to diagnose. As in our patient , combined diseases are more difficult to diagnose and to determine the optimal treatment. Since immunosuppression therapy of autoimmune diseases can cause and aggravate infection , management must be approached carefully. We can learn that various possibilities must be considered before diagnosing and treating a hepatic mass.
