  Background and aims Burning mouth<symptom> syndrome<disease> ( BMS) and atypical facial<symptom> pain<symptom> ( AFP) are often persistent idiopathic pain conditions that mainly affect middle-aged and elderly women. They have both been associated with various psychiatric disorders. This study examined current and lifetime prevalence of psychiatric axis I ( symptom-based) and II ( personality) disorders in patients with chronic idiopathic orofacial pain , and investigated the temporal relationship of psychiatric disorders and the onset of orofacial pain. Method Forty patients with BMS and 23 patients with AFP were recruited from Turku university hospital clinics. Mean age of the patients was 62.3 years ( range 35-84) and 90 % were female. BMS and AFP diagnoses were based on thorough clinical evaluation , and all patients had undergone clinical neurophysiological investigations including blink reflex and thermal quantitative tests. Current and lifetime DSM-IV diagnoses of axis I and II disorders were made on clinical basis with the aid of SCID-I and II-interviews. The detected prevalence rates and their 95 % confidence intervals based on binomial distribution were compared to three previous large population-based studies. Results Of the 63 patients , 26 ( 41.3 %) had had an axis I disorder that preceded the onset of orofacial pain , and 33 ( 52.4 %) had had a lifetime axis I disorder. Rate of current axis I disorders was 36.5 % , indicating that only about 16 % of lifetime disorders had remitted , and they tended to run chronic course. The most common lifetime axis I disorders were major depression<symptom> ( 30.2 %) , social phobia ( 15.9 %) , specific phobia ( 11.1 %) , and panic disorder ( 7.9 %). Twelve patients ( 19.0 %) had at least one cluster C personality disorder already before the emergence of orofacial pain. Patients with cluster C personality disorders are characterized as fearful and neurotic. None of the patients had cluster A ( characterized as odd and eccentric) or B ( characterized as dramatic , emotional or erratic) personality disorders. The most common personality disorders were obsessive-compulsive personality ( 14.3 %) , dependent personality ( 4.8 %) , and avoidant personality ( 3.2 %). The majority of the patients ( 54 %) had also one or more chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> conditions other than orofacial pain. In almost all patients ( 94 %) they were already present at the onset of orofacial pain. Conclusions Our results suggest that major depression<symptom> , persistent social phobia , and neurotic , fearful , and obsessive-compulsive personality characteristics are common in patients with chronic idiopathic orofacial pain. Most psychiatric disorders precede the onset of orofacial pain and they tend to run a chronic course. Implications We propose that the high psychiatric morbidity , and comorbidity to other chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> conditions , in chronic idiopathic orofacial pain can be best understood in terms of shared vulnerability to both chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> and specific psychiatric disorders , most likely mediated by dysfunctional brain dopamine activity.
