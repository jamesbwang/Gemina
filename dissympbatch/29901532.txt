  The value of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration ( EBUS-TBNA) in the mediastinal staging of lung cancer has been well established. However , data regarding its utility in the diagnosis of intrapulmonary lesions<symptom> has been sparse. This study assesses the sampling utility of convex probe EBUS-visible intrapulmonary lesions<symptom> not visualized by the white-light bronchoscopy. A retrospective analysis of EBUS-TBNA of EBUS-visible intrapulmonary lesions<symptom> was performed between January 2010 and March 2015. Patients with visible endobronchial lesions<symptom> by white-light bronchoscopy were excluded from analysis. Among 108 procedures , the diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA for EBUS-visible intrapulmonary lesions<symptom> was 87 %. Following diagnoses were established: lung cancer ( 73/67 .6 %) , lung metastases ( 10/9 .2 %) , infection ( 5/4 .6 %) , lymphoma ( 1/ < 1 %) , sarcoma/spindle cell sarcoma<disease> or neoplasm ( 3/2 .8 %) , unspecified malignancy ( 1 < 1 %) , and hamartoma ( 1/ < 1 %). EBUS-TBNA was nondiagnostic in 14 ( 13 %); among these , 9 turned out to have benign disease based on additional bronchoscopy samples or other testing and/or follow-up imaging. Five were ultimately diagnosed with a malignant condition: lymphoma ( 1) , epithelioid hemangioendothelioma ( 1) , and non-small cell lung cancer ( 3). The sensitivity and the negative predicted value of EBUS-TBNA for differentiating malignancy from benign disease was 94.7 % and 75 % , respectively , while the accuracy for diagnosing the neoplastic disease was 95.3 %. There was one major bleeding requiring bronchial artery embolization and 1 pneumothorax requiring chest tube drainage. EBUS-TBNA is safe and effective in the diagnosis of EBUS-visible intrapulmonary lesions<symptom>. It should be considered as the diagnostic test of choice in patients with these lesions<symptom> undergoing EBUS-TBNA for the staging of suspected lung cancer.
