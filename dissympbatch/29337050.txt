  Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disease affecting almost 3 million people in the United States and 50 million people worldwide. Despite availability of more than two dozen FDA-approved anti-epileptic drugs ( AEDs) , one-third of patients fail to receive adequate seizure<symptom> control. Specifically , pediatric genetic epilepsies are often the most severe , debilitating and pharmaco-resistant forms of epilepsy. Epileptic syndromes<disease> share a common symptom of unprovoked seizures<symptom>. While some epilepsies/forms of epilepsy are the result of acquired insults such as head trauma , febrile seizure<symptom> , or viral<disease> infection<disease> , others have a genetic basis. The discovery of epilepsy associated genes suggests varied underlying pathologies and opens the door for development of new `` personalized '' treatment options for each genetic epilepsy. Among these , Dravet syndrome<disease> ( DS) has received substantial attention for both the pre-clinical and early clinical development of novel therapeutics. Despite these advances , there is no FDA-approved treatment for DS. Over 80 % of patients diagnosed with DS carry a
