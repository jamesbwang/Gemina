  To explore the role of inducible costimulatory molecule ( ICOS) signaling pathway-mediated Th17 cells polarization in renal damage in essential hypertension. Four-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR) were randomly divided into control ( SHR-C) group and intervention ( SHR-I) group and subjected to intraperitoneal injections of PBS and ICOS monoclonal antibody for 2 weeks , respectively. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> of the rats was monitored using noninvasive tail artery blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> measuring instrument. The percentage of Th17 cells in the splenocytes was analyzed using flow cytometry , and the expression levels of IL-17A mRNA in the rat 's kidneys were detected using RT-PCR. The levels of IL-17A and TGF-β1 in the plasma and kidneys were dynamically detected using ELISA and immunohistochemistry , respectively. Renal pathological changes in the rats were detected using Masson staining. At the age of 10 and 30 weeks , the rats in SHR-C group had a significantly higher blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> than those in SHR-I group ( P < 0.05 or 0.01). In rats in SHR-C group , Th17 cells percentage in the splenocytes and IL-17A mRNA level in the kidney was significantly higher than those in SHR-I group from the age of 6 weeks ( P < 0.05). The expressions of IL-17A and TGF-β1 in the plasma and kidney were significantly higher in SHR-C group than that in SHR-I group at 6 weeks ( P < 0.05). Compared with those in SHR-C group , the rats in SHR-I group showed significant alleviation of renal fibrosis<disease> from the age of 30 weeks ( P < 0.05). The ICOS signaling pathway-mediated Th17 cells polarization plays an important role in renal fibrosis<disease> in hypertensive rats.
