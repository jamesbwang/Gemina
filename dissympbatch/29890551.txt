  Anti-aging protein Klotho is closely associated with a variety of chronic<disease> diseases<disease> and age-related diseases. And Klotho gene deficiency enhances the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR) , resulting in exacerbating streptozotocin-stimulated diabetic glomerular injury and promoting the progression of early diabetic kidney disease ( DKD). However , it has not yet been elucidated that the mechanism of Klotho function on the pathogenesis of diabetic glomerular injury. What 's more , insulin represents the antilipolytic effect via the mTOR-early growth response factor 1 ( Egr1) regulatory axis in mammalian organism. Valsartan reduced the high glucose-activated toll like report 4 ( TLR4) expression and inflammatory cytokines via inhibiting Egr1 expression. In this study , we aim to explore the effects of Klotho on Egr1 expression and TLR4/mTOR pathways activity in high glucose cultured rat mesangial cells ( RMCs) in vitro. Our study revealed that high glucose upregulated Egr1 to aggravate the inflammation<symptom> and fibrosis<disease> in RMCs. And high glucose activates Egr1/TLR4/mTOR regulatory axis in MCs , indicating that one coherent feedforward loop is formed. Anti-aging protein Klotho may attenuate glomerular inflammation<symptom> and fibrosis<disease> to provide protection against diabetic kidney injury via inhibiting the activity of Egr1/TLR4/mTOR regulatory axis in high glucose conditions. This study complements the function mechanism of Egr1/TLR4/mTOR regulatory axis playing in the pathogenesis of DKD , and provides a new direction and theoretical basis for anti-aging protein Klotho in DKD treatment.
