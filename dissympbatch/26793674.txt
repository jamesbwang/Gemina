  Constrictive pericarditis<disease> is a rare presentation. We need a very high index of clinical suspicion to diagnose the disease. It most commonly presents secondary to tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) in the developing world and post-radiation therapy in the developed world. Classically , it presents with symptoms of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and as pericardial thickening or calcification on imaging studies. In hospital settings , constrictive pericarditis<disease> is not usually considered as a differential in patients presenting with pleural effusion<symptom>. According to the literature , associated pleural effusions<symptom> in cases of constrictive pericarditis<disease> could be left-sided. Herein , we present two unusual presentations of cases with bilateral pleural effusions<symptom>. One of our cases developed constrictive pericarditis<disease> with concurrent active tuberculosis<disease> This is a rare presentation because , normally , constrictive pericarditis<disease> is a late complication of tuberculosis<disease> We suggest that when dealing with cases of bilateral pleural effusion<symptom> , the etiology of constrictive pericarditis<disease> should be considered.
