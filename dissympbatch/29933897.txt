  Liver disease in cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> has many causes , with biliary fibrosis<disease> due to abnormal CFTR protein predominating. Assessment requires aetiology to be defined. Biliary fibrosis<disease> may progress to cirrhosis and portal hypertension , which although initially asymptomatic , may cause varices and splenomegaly<symptom>. Monitoring progression includes clinical and ultrasound assessment with endoscopic assessment of varices for those at risk. Extrapolated primarily from longitudinal assessment of viral hepatitis<disease> in adults , non-invasive elastography has a potential role. Evidence is lacking to support intervention strategies , but ursodeoxycholic acid and ligation of varices are widely applied. Indication and timing of liver transplantation are not clearly defined. Multidisciplinary approach is needed to tailor assessment and guide management.
