  Ashwagandha ( Withania somnifera Linn.) a rejuvenative herb has long been used as an immunomodulator in Indian subcontinent. As immunity plays an important role in pathogenesis and treatment of tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) , so role of W. somnifera as an adjuvant has been studied on selected parameter. A randomized , double-blind placebo-control study was conducted in two groups of 60 newly diagnosed sputum<symptom> smear positive pulmonary TB patients on Directly Observed Treatment- short course ( DOTS) regime. W. somnifera root extract or placebo capsules were given as add-on therapy for duration of 12 weeks. Effects on sputum<symptom> conversion , Hemoglobin ( Hb) , body<symptom> weight , Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate ( ESR) , RBC counts , WBC counts , CD4 and CD8 counts , Serum Glutamic-Oxaloacetic Transaminase ( SGOT) , Serum Glutamic-Pyruvic Transaminase ( SGPT) , serum uric acid and HRQL ( Health Related Quality of Life) Index scores were studied. At the end of 8 weeks , sputum<symptom> conversion was seen in 86.6 % patients in study group and 76.6 % in placebo group. At the end of 12 weeks a highly significant increase was seen in both CD4 and CD8 counts in study group. A raised SGOT and SGPT levels ( > 35IU/L) were observed in 16.6 % and 33.3 % patients in study group; 43.33 % and 53.33 % in the placebo group of patients. Elevated serum uric acid levels ( > 6mg/dl) were observed in 20 % and 33.33 % in study and placebo group respectively. Average gain in HRQL score was better in patients of study group. Use of W. somnifera as an adjuvant in conjunction with anti-TB drugs used as DOTS showed a favorable effect on symptoms and immunological parameters in patients with pulmonary TB.
