  Background/aim: Multiple zones of injuries are formed after burns , consisting of a zone of coagulative necrosis<symptom> , a zone of hyperemia<symptom> , and a zone of stasis , in which progressive microcirculatory thrombosis leads to degeneration and deepening of the wound<disease>. We used an experimental rat comb burn model to test the hypothesis that use of low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH) may save the zone of stasis. Materials and methods: Adult female rats were randomly divided two groups: the LMWH group ( n = 8) rats received subcutaneous LMWH injections , while the saline group ( n = 8) rats were injected with the same volume of saline solution by the same route. The zone of stasis was evaluated macroscopically and histologically , and functional capillary density was evaluated. Results: Histological assessments revealed higher macrophage numbers and PML density , fibroblast proliferation , and angiogenesis in the LMWH group than in the saline group. Functional capillary density measurement in the stasis zones revealed no significant difference between the two groups in the first 4 days , although a significant difference in favor of the LMW group was observed in the last 3 days. Conclusion: The results of this experimental study show that LMWH is effective in saving the zone of stasis.
