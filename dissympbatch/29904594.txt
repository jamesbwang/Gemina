  Asthma is a chronic obstructive respiratory<disease> disease<disease> characterised by bronchial inflammation<symptom>. Its biological and clinical features have been widely explored and a number of pharmacological treatments are currently available. Currently several aspects of asthma pathophysiological background remain unclear , and this is represent a limitation for the traditional asthma phenotype approach. In this scenario , the identification of new molecular and clinical biomarkers may be helpful in order to better understand the disease , define specific diagnostic tools and highlight relevant novel targets for pharmacological treatments. Omics technologies offer innovative research tools for addressing the above mentioned goals. However , there is still a lot to do both in the fields of basic research and in the clinical application. Recently , genome-wide association studies , microRNAs and proteomics are contributing to enrich the available data for the identification of new asthma biomarkers. A precise approach to the patient with asthma , particularly with severe uncontrolled asthma , requires new and specific therapeutic targets , but also proper tools able to drive the clinician in tailoring the treatment. On the other hand , there is a need of predictors to treatment 's response , particularly in the field of biological drugs , whose sustainability implies a correct and precise selection of the patients. Translating acquired omics knowledge in clinical practice may address the unmet needs described above , but large-scale studies are required in order to confirm their relevance and effectiveness in daily practice. Thus in our opinion the application of omics is still lagging in the real-life setting.
