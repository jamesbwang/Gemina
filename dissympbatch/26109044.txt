  Elevated vitamin B12 is a sign for liver damage , but its significance in chronic stable heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) is less known. The present study investigated the clinical correlates and prognostic significance of vitamin B12 levels in stable systolic HF. A total of 129 consecutive patients with HF and 50 control subjects were enrolled. Data regarding demographics , clinical signs , therapeutic and conventional echocardiographic measurements were recorded for all patients. Right-sided HF was defined as the presence of at least one of the typical symptoms ( ankle swelling) or specific signs ( jugular venous distention<symptom> or abdominojugular reflux) of right HF. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to determine the independent prognostic determinants of mortality. Baseline B12 levels in HF patients ( n = 129) with and without right sided HF were significantly higher compared to healthy controls ( n = 50): Median 311 pg/mL and 235 pg/mL vs 198 pg/mL , respectively ( Increased B12 in stable HF patients is associated with increased direct bilirubin due to right HF , indicating a cardiohepatic syndrome<disease> , but neither B12 nor folic acid are independently associated with mortality.
