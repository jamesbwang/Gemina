  BACKGROUND Rhabdomyolysis and primary dilated cardiomyopathies without skeletal muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> are rare features of X-linked dystrophinopathies. We report a rare case of an X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy ( XLDCM) presenting with acute rhabdomyolysis and myocarditis<disease> We illustrate the confounding diagnostic influence of a reactivated , persistent EBV myocarditis<disease> as the presumed cause for this patient 's XLDCM. CASE REPORT A 23-year-old Australian man presented with acute rhabdomyolysis and elevated creatine kinase ( CK) levels. He was managed conservatively with intravenous hydration and developed acute<symptom> pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom>. Cardiac MRI and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a dilated cardiomyopathy and viral myocarditis<disease> Extensive sero-logical investigations identified reactivation of EBV , which was presumed to account for his viral myocarditis<disease> The patient recovered and was discharged with down-trending CK levels. Follow-up transthoracic echocardiograms and cardiac MRI showed a persisting dilated cardiomyopathy. His CK continued to remain elevated and his EBV IgM serology remained positive. An inflammatory polymyositis with either a primary autoimmune pathophysiology or secondary to a chronic EBV infection was considered. Oral corticosteroids were trialed and reduced his CK significantly until therapy was ceased. Massively parallel sequencing eventually identified a two-exon deletion targeting Xp21 consistent with the diagnosis of a rare XLDCM. CONCLUSIONS Rhabdomyolysis and co-existing primary dilated cardiomyopathies are rare diagnostic manifestations in a minority of X-linked dystrophinopathies. Chronic viral<disease> infections<disease> and their reactivation may complicate the diagnostic process and incorrectly attribute an inherited cardiomyopathy to an acquired infective etiology. EBV reactivation rarely induces myocarditis<disease> Therefore , primary and unresolving dilated cardiomyopathy with persistently elevated CK must prompt consideration of an underlying dystrophinopathy.
