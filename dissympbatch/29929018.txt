  To evaluate the prevalence of anemia<symptom> among female adolescents and young adults seeking abortion<disease> care at a county hospital , and to determine its associated factors. A cross-sectional retrospective study. John H. Stroger , Jr.. Hospital of Cook County , Chicago , Illinois. Young women ( N = 2916; ages 11-24 years) who underwent first trimester medical or surgical termination in 2016. Hemoglobin concentration at time of presentation , age , gestational age , body mass index , race/ethnicity , education , sexually transmitted infection status , and insurance status. On average , women were 21 ( SD , 2.2) years old , 87 % ( 2545 of 2916) African-American , and 64 % ( 1863 of 2916) were Medicaid recipients. Gestational age at time of presentation ranged from 4 weeks 6 days to 13 weeks 6 days , and 58 % ( 1695 of 2916) had surgical termination. Overall , 16 % ( 451 of 2916) had hemoglobin concentrations of less than 11 g/dL. Categorization of severity showed that 4 % ( 126 of 2916) of women had moderate and 11 % ( 325 of 2916) had mild anemia<symptom> Only 2.6 % of women ( 75 of 2916) had any history of anemia<symptom> , and 91 % ( 412 of 451) of anemic women did not have a preexisting anemia<symptom> diagnosis. Fifteen percent of anemic women ( 51 of 451) had positive sexually transmitted infection screening , but positive status was not associated with anemia<symptom> in crude or multivariable models ( P = .4-.6). In a multivariable model , later gestational age , decreasing body mass index , and multiparity were significantly associated with anemia<symptom> prevalence after adjustment. Our study showed an elevated prevalence of undiagnosed anemia<symptom> Ultimately , the abortion<disease> care setting can be an intersection for continued ambulatory care and provides an important opportunity to diagnose and educate young women on anemia<symptom> management.
