  Upadacitinib is a selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 and was efficacious in phase 2 studies in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis<disease>. We aimed to assess the efficacy of upadacitinib in patients with inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( csDMARDs). This study is a double-blind , placebo-controlled trial at 150 sites in 35 countries. We enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with active rheumatoid arthritis<disease> for 3 months or longer , who had received csDMARDs for at least 3 months with a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before study entry , and had an inadequate response to at least one of the following csDMARDs: methotrexate , sulfasalazine , or leflunomide. Using interactive response technology , we randomly assigned patients receiving stable background csDMARDs ( 2:2:1:1) to receive a once-daily extended-release formulation of upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg , or placebo , for 12 weeks. Patients , investigators , and the funder were masked to allocation. After 12 weeks , patients taking placebo received 15 mg or 30 mg of upadacitinib once daily , according to the prespecified randomisation assignment. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients at week 12 who achieved 20 % improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria ( ACR20) , and a 28-joint disease activity score using C-reactive protein ( DAS28 ( CRP)) of 3 · 2 or less. We did efficacy analyses in the full analysis set of all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug , and used non-responder imputation for assessment of the primary outcomes. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT02675426. Between Dec 17 , 2015 , and Dec 22 , 2016 , 1083 patients were assessed for eligibility , of whom 661 were recruited and randomly assigned to receive upadacitinib 15 mg ( n = 221) , upadacitinib 30 mg ( n = 219) , or placebo ( n = 221). All patients received at least one dose of study drug , and 618 ( 93 %) completed 12 weeks of treatment. At week 12 , ACR20 was achieved by 141 ( 64 %; 95 % CI 58-70) of 221 patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 145 ( 66 %; 60-73) of 219 patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg , compared with 79 ( 36 %; 29-42) of 221 patients receiving placebo ( p < 0 · 0001 for each dose vs placebo). DAS28 ( CRP) of 3 · 2 or less was met by 107 ( 48 %; 95 % CI 42-55) patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 105 ( 48 %; 41-55) patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg , compared with 38 ( 17 %; 12-22) patients receiving placebo ( p < 0 · 0001 for each dose vs placebo). Adverse events were reported in 125 ( 57 %) of 221 patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg , 118 ( 54 %) of 219 patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg , and 108 ( 49 %) of 221 patients receiving placebo. The most frequently reported adverse events ( ≥ 5 % of patients in any group) were nausea<symptom> ( 16 ( 7 %) of 221 in the upadacitinib 15 mg group; three ( 1 %) of 219 in the upadacitinib 30 mg group; and seven ( 3 %) of 221 in the placebo group) , nasopharyngitis ( 12 ( 5 %); 13 ( 6 %); and nine ( 4 %)) , upper respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( 12 ( 5 %); 12 ( 5 %); and nine ( 4 %)) , and headache<symptom> ( nine ( 4 %); seven ( 3 %); and 12 ( 5 %)). More infections were reported for upadacitinib ( 64 ( 29 %) of 221 patients receiving 15 mg and 69 ( 32 %) of 219 patients receiving 30 mg) versus placebo ( 47 ( 21 %) of 221 patients). There were three herpes<disease> zoster<disease> infections ( one ( < 1 %) in the placebo group , one ( < 1 %) in the upadacitinib 15 mg group , and one ( < 1 %) in the upadacitinib 30 mg group) and one primary varicella zoster<disease> virus infection ( one ( < 1 %) in the upadacitinib 30 mg group) , two malignancies ( both in the upadacitinib 30 mg group) , one adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular event ( in the upadacitinib 30 mg group) , and five serious infections ( one ( < 1 %) in the placebo group , one ( < 1 %) in the upadacitinib 15 mg group , three ( 1 %) in the upadacitinib 30 mg group). No deaths were reported during the trial. Patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis<disease> who received upadacitinib ( 15 mg or 30 mg) in combination with csDMARDs showed significant improvements in clinical signs and symptoms.
