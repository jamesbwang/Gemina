  Numerous studies have observed a relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and hypertension , but the effects of metabolic syndrome<disease> on hypertension , and their interaction with obstructive sleep apnea , remain unclear. For this study , a total of 2972 patients were recruited from the Shanghai Sleep Health Study. Data from overnight polysomnography parameters , serum lipids , fasting blood glucose , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and anthropometric measurements were collected. The authors then explored the independent associations and multiplicative and additive interactions of predictors of metabolic syndrome<disease> with hypertension. A positive dose-response relationship was observed between systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and quartiles of fasting glucose , triglyceride , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , body mass index , and apnea-hypopnea index. Furthermore , logistic regression analysis showed that , in men , a high triglyceride level , hyperglycemia , and overweight status ( and their interaction effect on obstructive sleep apnea) were associated with hypertension. Being overweight and hyperglycemic may markedly augment the adverse effect of obstructive sleep apnea on hypertension in men. Therefore , hypertension therapy should be individualized based on the specific comorbidities of each patient.
