  Malan syndrome<disease> is an overgrowth disorder described in a limited number of individuals. We aim to delineate the entity by studying a large group of affected individuals. We gathered data on 45 affected individuals with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis through an international collaboration and compared data to the 35 previously reported individuals. Results indicate that height is > 2 SDS in infancy and childhood but in only half of affected adults. Cardinal facial characteristics include long , triangular face , macrocephaly , prominent forehead , everted lower lip , and prominent chin. Intellectual disability is universally present , behaviorally anxiety<symptom> is characteristic. Malan syndrome<disease> is caused by deletions or point mutations of NFIX clustered mostly in exon 2. There is no genotype-phenotype correlation except for an increased risk for epilepsy with 19p13 .2 microdeletions. Variants arose de novo , except in one family in which mother was mosaic. Variants causing Malan and Marshall-Smith syndrome<disease> can be discerned by differences in the site of stop codon formation. We conclude that Malan syndrome<disease> has a well recognizable phenotype that usually can be discerned easily from Marshall-Smith syndrome<disease> but rarely there is some overlap. Differentiation from Sotos and Weaver syndrome<disease> can be made by clinical evaluation only.
