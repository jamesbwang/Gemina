  Communications between an artery and the bowel are termed arterio-enteric fistulae<disease>. These are uncommon and mainly involve the aorta and duodenum. They can cause fatal haemorrhage. A primary aorto-enteric fistula<disease> has several aetiologies , one of which is post-radiotherapy. 75-year old gentleman presented with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and haemorrhagic shock<symptom>. He had a past history of right colonic cancer treated by resection and radiotherapy. At emergency gastroscopy he became critically unstable and the procedure was unsuccessful to achieve haemostasis. After resuscitation , a CT angiogram confirmed a right ilio-duodenal fistula<disease> between the right common iliac artery and duodenum. Interventional radiology was performed and a covered stent was inserted in the right common iliac artery. The patient recovered and was subsequently discharged from hospital. Three months later , he presented once again with similar massive haematemesis. Despite all efforts to stabilise him , he passed away a few hours after this second admission. This case highlights what could possibly be a limitation of interventional radiology in providing definitive treatment for such a presentation. There are no set guidelines for the management of bleeding aorto-duodenal fistulae<disease> and literature is scarce. This makes it difficult to treat and the outcome is relatively unpredictable. While minimally invasive radiological techniques are invaluable in many areas and life-saving in countless emergency bleeds , cases like these should ideally not be treated by stenting alone. It would be wise to follow arterio-enteric fisula bleeds by definitive open surgical repair.
