  Retinal degeneration is a common cause of irreversible blindness<symptom> and is caused by the death of retinal light-sensitive neurons called photoreceptors. At the onset of degeneration , stressed photoreceptors cause retinal glial cells to secrete neuroprotective factors that slow the pace of degeneration. Leukemia<disease> inhibitory factor ( LIF) is one such factor that is required for endogenous neuroprotection. Photoreceptors are known to release signals of cellular stress , called damage-associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs) early in degeneration , and we hypothesized that receptors for DAMPs or pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs) play a key role in the induction of LIF and neuroprotective stress responses in retinal glial cells. Toll-like receptor 2 ( TLR2) is a well-established DAMP receptor. In our experiments , activation of TLR2 protected both male and female mice from light damage , while the loss of TLR2 in female mice did not impact photoreceptor survival. In contrast , induction of protective stress responses , microglial phenotype and photoreceptor survival were strongly impacted in male TLR2
