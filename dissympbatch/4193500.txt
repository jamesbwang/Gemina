  Climate change is impacting ecosystem structure and function , with potentially drastic downstream effects on human and animal health. Emerging zoonotic diseases are expected to be particularly vulnerable to climate and biodiversity disturbance. Anthrax<disease> is an archetypal zoonosis that manifests its most significant burden on vulnerable pastoralist communities. The current study sought to investigate the influence of temperature increases on geographic anthrax<disease> suitability in the temperate , boreal , and arctic North , where observed climate impact has been rapid. This study also explored the influence of climate relative to more traditional factors , such as livestock distribution , ungulate biodiversity , and soil-water balance<symptom> , in demarcating risk. Machine learning was used to model anthrax<disease> suitability in northern latitudes. The model identified climate , livestock density and wild ungulate species richness as the most influential features in predicting suitability. These findings highlight the significance of warming temperatures for anthrax<disease> ecology in northern latitudes , and suggest potential mitigating effects of interventions targeting megafauna biodiversity conservation in grassland ecosystems , and animal health promotion among small to midsize livestock herds.
