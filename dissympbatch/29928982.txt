  It is a well-known fact that there is significant heterogeneity in the origins of asthma in adults and children. This article examines the roots of asthma across the ages including atopy , the role of the microbiome and viral<disease> infections<disease> , along with comorbidities/confounders such as obesity , aspirin-exacerbated respiratory<disease> disease<disease> ( AERD) , neutrophilic asthma , cigarette smoking and the possibility of an asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) overlap syndrome<disease>. Data was taken from various scientific search engines including PubMed and Science Direct databases. Articles that reviewed information on the origins of asthma in persons of all ages including different phenotypes and genotypes of asthma were used. Asthma is a common and complex<disease> disease<disease> whose origins are likely a combination of both genetic predisposition and environmental exposures. Factors such as the microbiome , other atopic disease , viral<disease> infections<disease> in young children , and other diagnoses such as obesity or AERD are important to consider when creating a treatment plan for patients. Asthma is a disease that is often diagnosed in childhood but can present at any age. There is debate in the field as to whether asthma is one disease or several different diseases that include airway inflammation<symptom> as a key finding. There are risk factors for disease in the environment and thru co-morbidities that likely play significant roles in both the origins of asthma , the development of symptoms , and the response to treatment. These factors are even more important as we look towards the future with the goal of personalized medicine.
