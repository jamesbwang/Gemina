  In this study , the three-dimensional spatial distributions of a number of metabolites involved in regulating symbiosis and biological nitrogen fixation ( BNF) within soybean root nodules<symptom> were revealed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging ( MALDI-MSI). While many metabolites exhibited distinct spatial compartmentalization , some metabolites were asymmetrically distributed throughout the nodule<disease> ( e.g. , S-adenosylmethionine). These results establish a more complex metabolic view of plant-bacteria symbiosis ( and BNF) within soybean nodules<symptom> than previously hypothesized. Collectively these findings suggest that spatial perspectives in metabolic regulation should be considered to unravel the overall complexity of interacting organisms , like those relating to associations of nitrogen-fixing bacteria with host plants.
