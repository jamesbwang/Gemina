  Many gingival lesions<symptom> are not induced by plaque. The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency of biopsied non-plaque-induced gingival lesions<symptom> ( NPIGL) in a Chilean population. One thousand twelve cases of biopsied gingival lesions<symptom> with confirmed anatomopathologic diagnosis were included , from the records of the Oral Pathology Referral Institute ( OPRI) , Faculty of Dentistry , University of Chile , between years 1990 and 2009. The most frequent non plaque-induced gingival lesions<symptom> categories from biopsied cases included hyperplastic lesions<symptom> , malignancies and benign neoplasms. The most frequent diagnoses in each category were fibrous hyperplasia<disease> ( 35.47 %) , squamous cell carcinoma ( 3.85 %) and giant cell fibroma ( 2.08 %) , respectively. From all lesions<symptom> , only 8.3 % fitted in the specified categories of the current classification of periodontal<disease> diseases<disease>. The most frequent biopsied NPIGL were hyperplastic lesions<symptom> and neoplasms. These categories represent relevant lesions<symptom> to be included in a future periodontal classification system to improve the care needs of the patients , as well as early diagnosis and treatment.
