  The p2b domain of Rous sarcoma<disease> virus ( RSV) Gag and the p6 domain of HIV-1 Gag contain late assembly ( L) domains that engage the ESCRT membrane fission machinery and are essential for virus release. We now show that the PPXY-type RSV L domain specifically recruits the BAR domain protein PACSIN2 into virus-like particles ( VLP) , in addition to the NEDD4-like ubiquitin ligase ITCH and ESCRT pathway components such as TSG101. PACSIN2 , which has been implicated in the remodeling of cellular membranes<symptom> and the actin cytoskeleton , is also recruited by HIV-1 p6 independent of its ability to engage the ESCRT factors TSG101 or ALIX. Moreover , PACSIN2 is robustly recruited by NEDD4-2s , a NEDD4-like ubiquitin ligase capable of rescuing HIV-1 budding defects. The NEDD4-2s-induced incorporation of PACSIN2 into VLP correlated with the formation of Gag-ubiquitin conjugates , indicating that PACSIN2 binds ubiquitin. Although PACSIN2 was not required for a single cycle of HIV-1 replication after infection with cell-free virus , HIV-1 spreading was nevertheless severely impaired in T cell lines and primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells depleted of PACSIN2. HIV-1 spreading could be restored by reintroduction of wild-type PACSIN2 , but not of a SH3 domain mutant unable to interact with the actin polymerization regulators WASP and N-WASP. Overall , our observations indicate that PACSIN2 promotes the cell-to-cell spreading of HIV-1 by connecting Gag to the actin cytoskeleton.
