  Anemia<symptom> is the defining feature in most patients with myelodysplastic syndromes<disease> ( MDS) , yet defects in erythropoiesis have not been well characterized. We examined freshly obtained bone<disease> marrow ( BM) samples for stage-specific abnormalities during terminal erythroid differentiation ( TED) from 221 samples ( MDS , n = 205 from 113 unique patients; normal , n = 16) by measuring the surface expression of glycophorin A , band 3 , and integrin α-4. Clinical and biologic associations were sought with presence or absence of TED and the specific stage of erythroid arrest. In 27 % of MDS samples ( 56/205) , there was no quantifiable TED documented by surface expression of integrin α-4 and band 3 by terminally differentiating erythroblasts. Absence of quantifiable TED was associated with a significantly worse overall survival ( 56 vs 103 months ,
