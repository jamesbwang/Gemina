  γδ T cells , αβ T cells , and innate lymphoid cells ( ILCs) are capable of producing interleukin ( IL) -17 A , IL-17F , and IL-22. Among these three families of lymphocytes , it is emerging that γδ T cells are , at least in rodents , the main source of these key pro-inflammatory cytokines. γδ T cells were implicated in multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases , including psoriasis , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis<disease> and uveitis , colitis<disease> , and rheumatoid arthritis<disease>. Recent findings pointed toward a central role of γδ T cells in the pathogenesis of spondyloarthritis ( SpA) , a group of inflammatory rheumatic diseases affecting the axial skeleton. SpA primarily manifests as inflammation<symptom> and new bone formation at the entheses , which are connecting tendons or ligaments with bone. In SpA patients , joint<symptom> inflammation<symptom> is frequently accompanied by extra-articular manifestations , such as inflammatory bowel disease or psoriasis. In humans , genome-wide association studies could link the IL-23/ IL-17 cytokine axis to SpA. Accordingly , antibodies targeting IL-23/ IL-17 for SpA treatment already showed promising results in clinical studies. However , the contribution of IL-17-producing γδ T cells to SpA pathogenesis is certainly not an open-and-shut case. Indeed , the cell types that are chiefly involved in local inflammation<symptom> in human SpA still remain largely unclear. Some studies focusing on blood or synovium from SpA patients reported augmented IL-17-producing and IL-23 receptor-expressing γδ T cells , but other cell types might contribute as well. Here , we summarize the current understanding of how γδ T cells , αβ T cells , and ILCs contribute to the pathogenesis of human and experimental SpA.
