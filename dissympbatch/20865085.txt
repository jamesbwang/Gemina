  We present a case of a 60-year-old female patient who has significant medical history of renal cell carcinoma diagnosed 2 years back and had undergone right nephrectomy and chemotherapy. She presented to the hospital with complaints of abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and jaundice of 2 weeks duration and was found to have periampullary mass lesion<symptom> causing compression of distal common bile duct on imaging with computed tomography of abdomen. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and endoscopic ultrasound showed ampullary mass lesion<symptom> causing biliary obstruction along with abdominal<symptom> lymphadenopathy<disease>. A temporary plastic stent was placed to relieve obstruction. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the periampullary mass along with immunohistochemical staining confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
