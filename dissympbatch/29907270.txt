  Both limb<symptom> muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> and respiratory<symptom> muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> are exceedingly common in critically ill patients. Respiratory<symptom> muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> prolongs ventilator dependence , predisposing to nosocomial complications and death. Limb<symptom> muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> persists for months after discharge from intensive care and results in poor long-term functional status and quality of life. Major mechanisms of muscle injury include critical illness polymyoneuropathy , sepsis<disease> , pharmacologic exposures , metabolic derangements , and excessive muscle loading and unloading. The diaphragm may become weak because of excessive unloading ( leading to atrophy) or because of excessive loading ( either concentric or eccentric) owing to insufficient ventilator assistance.
