  This study tested the hypothesis that Malt1 deficiency in macrophages contributes to dextran sodium sulfate ( DSS)- induced intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> in Malt1-deficient mice. In people , combined immunodeficiency caused by a homozygous mutation in the MALT1 gene is associated with increased susceptibility to bacterial infections and chronic inflammation<symptom> , including severe<symptom> inflammation<symptom> along the gastrointestinal tract. The consequences of Malt1 deficiency have largely been attributed to its role in lymphocytes , but Malt1 is also expressed in macrophages , where it is activated downstream of TLR4 and dectin-1. The effect of Malt1 deficiency in murine macrophages and its contribution to DSS-induced colitis<disease> have not been investigated. Our objectives were to compare the susceptibility of Malt1
