  The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance of different diagnostic tests for histologic chorioamnionitis<disease> in patients at more than 20 weeks of gestation. A systematic search was carried out through MEDLINE , EMBASE , LILACS , CENTRAL and unpublished literature. Observational studies included with pregnant women ( > 20 weeks) with chorioamnionitis<disease> The reference standard was the histopathological study of the placenta , umbilical cord and fetal membranes<symptom>. Two independent researchers extracted data and performed a meta-analysis of diagnostic tests. Twenty-nine articles were included. The studies provided evidence in the form of maternal clinical and serological tests; tests of vaginal fluid , amniotic fluid or the umbilical cord; fetal monitoring and ultrasound tests. To assess the performance of maternal serum CRP , 13 studies were included , showing a combined sensitivity of 68.7 % ( 95 % CI 58 % -77 %) and a combined specificity of 77.1 % ( 95 % CI 67 % -84 %). Maternal leukocytosis was evaluated in four publications , showing a combined sensitivity of 51 % ( 95 % CI 40 % -62 %) and a combined specificity of 65 % ( 95 % CI 50 % -78 %). CRP and maternal leukocytosis , showed a low sensitivity and specificity. The sonographic evaluation of the fetal thymus is also more sensitive for the diagnosis of histologic chorioamnionitis<disease> than the fetal biophysical profile.
