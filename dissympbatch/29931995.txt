  Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease with an uncertain etiology , characterized by the production of non-necrotizing granulomas<disease>. The most frequent presentation is pulmonary and mediastinal , although it might affect any other organ. Hepatic alterations occur in 50 to 65 % of the cases. Nevertheless , it is commonly subclinical or detected during a study of the alteration of liver enzymes. It is very unusual that disease onset occurs as an isolated hepatic tumor. A hepatic biopsy is usually required to confirm the diagnosis. A differential diagnosis must be established via any hepatic granulomatous disease , infectious or autoimmune disease as well as the exclusion of malignancy. We present a clinical case of a female diagnosed with an isolated hepatic sarcoidosis that simulated a unique hepatic metastatic lesion<symptom>. The hepatic biopsy was diagnostic.
