  Inappropriate sinus tachycardia<symptom> ( IST) is a clinical syndrome<disease> , oftentimes debilitating , defined by fast sinus rates ( > 100 b.p.m. at rest or > 90 b.p.m. on average over 24 h and not due to underlying causes) associated with symptoms that may include palpitations , as described in some guidelines and consensus documents. While heart rates may vary by patient , especially based upon gender and age , some individuals experience sinus tachycardia<symptom> or persistent fast sinus rates with no symptoms; these individuals would not necessarily be considered to have the syndrome<disease> of IST. Various explanations for IST have been considered but a definitive common mechanism is not yet known; the true aetiology may be multifactorial. A thorough evaluation of secondary causes of tachycardia<symptom> is required in the work-up of all cases and if found , must be treated before a diagnosis of IST can be made. Finally , effective treatments vary but can include ivabradine , beta-blockers , or calcium channel antagonists; ablation is seldom advised.
