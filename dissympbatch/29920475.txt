  Intrauterine growth retardation ( IUGR) leads to increased predisposition to metabolic syndrome<disease> in adult life but the mechanisms remain obscure. Considering a significant number of functional similarities , IUGR piglets appear to be a good model to study the development of this syndrome<disease> in humans. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ultrastructure and proteomic profile of the liver in IUGR pig neonates to discover early markers of predisposition to obesity and insulin resistance. In our study intestine and liver tissue samples were investigated in 7 day old IUGR and normal body<symptom> weight ( NBW) littermate piglets using histometry , mass spectrometry , in-tissue cytometry analysis and confocal microscopy. Compared to NBW , the liver in IUGR neonates was characterized by a significantly enhanced ratio of Kupffer cells to hepatocytes and insulin receptor abundance as well as higher percentages of cells expressing receptors for adipokines ( resistin and adiponectin) , increased expression of TNF-Î± ( as marker of inflammation<symptom>) , and increased expression of insulin receptor and uncoupling protein 3 ( UCP3). Moreover , NBW and IUGR differed in proteomic profile , including protein metabolism ( proteasomes , cathepsin D , phermitin , phosphoglucomutase) , carbohydrate metabolism ( hexokinase 1 , phosphoglucokinase , galactokinase , aldolase B , glucose-6-phosphate isomerase) , oxidative stress and chromatin organization and DNA uptake ( histones , lamin a/c). Reduction of hepatocyte numbers concomitant with significant modifications of expression of key hormones and enzymes for protein and carbohydrate metabolism in IUGR neonates may predispose to insulin resistance and obesity in adult life.
