  An 18-yr-old , captive-born male Bengal tiger ( Panthera tigris tigris) presented a 1-yr history of chronic and progressive paraparesis<disease> in both hind<symptom> limbs. Lateral and hind<symptom> limb radiographs were revealed normal except for severe spondylosis deformans , forming a bony bridge between the last lumbar and the first sacral vertebra and disc mineralization between the second and third lumbar vertebra. Medical therapies were instituted , including corticosteroids , hydroacupuncture and electroacupuncture. Animal training allowed veterinarians to perform acupuncture safely without having to anesthetize the animal. Animal training made intensive treatment possible. Neither corticosteroids nor hydroacupuncture alone provided much clinical improvement. The tiger reacted positively after electroacupuncture was performed. The tiger began showing clinical improvement after three electroacupuncture treatments and could eventually walk on all four limbs at the end of the treatment.
