  We aimed to assess the predictive value of different T descriptors , including the whole tumour size ( Dwhole) and solid component size ( Dsolid) , in patients with clinical Stage IA adenocarcinoma who underwent sublobar resection. According to computed tomography images in the lung window , T descriptors , Dwhole and Dsolid , were applied. To evaluate the predictive value of these 2 different descriptors in predicting tumour recurrence and pathological malignant behaviours , Cox hazard regression and a receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis , respectively , were used. In total , 247 patients were included. Of these patients , 109 and 138 had ground glass and solid nodules<symptom> , respectively. When the T descriptor was changed from Dwhole to Dsolid , 37 tumours ( 15 %) were downgraded to T1a status from T1b/T1c status. Multivariable Cox analysis showed that Dsolid was an independent risk factor of worse recurrence-free survival ( hazard ratio ( HR) 2.36 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.24-4.47; P = 0.009) , while Dwhole was not ( HR 1.51 , 95 % CI 0.79-2.89; P = 0.215). In the receiver-operating characteristic analysis , the areas under the curves for Dwhole and Dsolid used to identify pathological malignant behaviours were 0.598 and 0.739 , respectively. The T descriptor , which is represented by Dsolid , rather than Dwhole , is a better predictor of tumour recurrence after sublobar resection in clinical Stage IA lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore , our results provide some clues indicating that sublobar resection should be performed cautiously in patients with lung adenocarcinoma manifesting as ground glass nodule<disease> with Dsolid > 2 cm.
