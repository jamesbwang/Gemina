  In this study , we aim to describe the post-sepsis syndrome<disease> from the perspective of the sepsis<disease> survivors. The study is a prospective , observational online international survey. Sepsis<disease> survivors enrolled via social media from 13 September 2014 to 13 September 2016. None. Physiologic , physical and psychological function post-sepsis; and patient satisfaction with sepsis-centered care. 1731 completed surveys from 41 countries were analyzed , with 79.9 % female respondents , age 47.6 Â± 14.4 years. The majority of respondents ( 47.8 %) had sepsis<disease> within the last year. Survivors reported an increase in sensory , integumentary , digestive , breathing , chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , kidney and musculoskeletal problems after sepsis<disease> ( all P-value < 0.0001). Physical functions such as daily chores , running errands , spelling , reading and reduced libido posed increased difficulty ( all P-value < 0.0001). Within 7 days prior to completing the survey , the survivors reported varying degrees of anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> , fatigue<symptom> and sleep disturbance. Sepsis<disease> survivors reported dissatisfaction with a number of hospital support services , with up to 29.3 % of respondents stating no social services support was provided for their condition. Sepsis<disease> survivors suffer from a myriad of physiologic , physical and psychological challenges. Survivors overall reveal dissatisfaction with sepsis-related care , suggesting areas for improvement both in-hospital and post-discharge.
