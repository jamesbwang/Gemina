  Understanding how wild immune variation covaries with other traits can reveal how costs and trade-offs shape immune evolution in the wild. Divergent life history strategies may increase or alleviate immune costs , helping shape immune variation in a consistent , testable way. Contrasting hypotheses suggest that shorter life histories may alleviate costs by offsetting them against increased mortality , or increase the effect of costs if immune responses are traded off against development or reproduction. We investigated the evolutionary relationship between life history and immune responses within an island<disease> radiation of three-spined stickleback , with discrete populations of varying life histories and parasitism. We sampled two short-lived , two long-lived and an anadromous population using qPCR to quantify current immune profile and RAD-seq data to study the distribution of immune variants within our assay genes and across the genome. Short-lived populations exhibited significantly increased expression of all assay genes , which was accompanied by a strong association with population-level variation in local alleles and divergence in a gene that may be involved in complement pathways. In addition , divergence around the eda gene in anadromous fish is likely associated with increased inflammation<symptom>. A wider analysis of 15 populations across the island<disease> revealed that immune genes across the genome show evidence of having diverged alongside life history strategies. Parasitism and reproductive investment were also important sources of variation for expression , highlighting the caution required when assaying immune responses in the wild. These results provide strong , gene-based support for current hypotheses linking life history and immune variation across multiple populations of a vertebrate model.
