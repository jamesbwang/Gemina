  Few studies have assessed the safety and effectiveness of the numerous available chemotherapeutic therapies for geriatric oncology patients. Most safety studies are conducted in large trials , and there is some uncertainty surrounding whether the results would be the same in typical daily use. This retrospective study aims to assess the adverse effects of real-world capecitabine use in elderly patients. We reviewed the records of patients treated with capecitabine in an oncology department of a University Clinic in Nijmegen , The Netherlands. We scored adverse effects such as hand-foot syndrome<disease> and diarrhea<disease> , and dosage adjustments and the reasons for them. In total , 132 patients were included , 69 of whom were aged 70 years or below ( mean age: 57 years) , while 63 were aged older than 70 years ( mean age: 74 years). Patients aged over 70 years experienced more serious adverse effects than younger patients. Grade 2 or 3 hand-foot syndrome<disease> toxicity was experienced by 20.2 % of patients aged younger than 70 years and by 34.9 % of patients older than 70 years ( p = 0.059). Grade 2 , 3 , or 4 diarrhea<disease> was experienced by 17.4 % of the patients aged younger than 70 years but by 31.7 % of the patients aged older than 70 years ( p = 0.044). Dosage was adjusted for 27/69 patients in the younger group and 52/63 patients in the older group ( p = 0.001). The difference in observed adverse effects can not be the sole explanation for the high incidence of observed dose adjustments. A prospective follow-up study of elderly patients using capecitabine outside clinical trials is needed to evaluate the optimum balance<symptom> between adverse effects and efficacy.
