  Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is one of the commonest causes of hospital visit in the neonatal period. When severe , it is a leading cause of irreversible neurological and musculoskeletal disability. Prompt recognition and timely interventions are imperative for a drastic reduction in complications associated with severe hyperbilirubinaemia in newborns. We report a 4-year descriptive and longitudinal study to determine the causes , clinical presentations and long-term outcomes in newborns admitted for severe neonatal jaundice. Newborns admitted and managed for severe neonatal jaundice at the Enugu State University Teaching Hospital during a 4-year period were enrolled and followed up for 2 years. A total of 1920 newborns were admitted during the study period and 48 were managed for severe hyperbilirubinaemia giving an in-hospital incidence rate of 25 ( 95 % CI 18-32) per 1000 admitted newborns. The mean age of onset was 3.4 ± 0.5 days ( range 1-8 days) and hospital presentation from time of first notice was 4.3 ± 0.4 days ( range 1-9 days). The total and unconjugated admission serum bilirubin ranged from 7.1 to 71.1 ( mean 26 ± 2.5 mg/dl) and 4.2 to 46.3 mg/dl ( mean 18.3 ± 9.2) respectively. Earliest sign of severe hyperbilirubinaemia in newborns were: refusal to suck ( 15.2 %) and depressed primitive reflexes ( 24.5 %) while the commonest signs included high pitch cry ( 11.9 %) , convulsion<symptom> and stiffness ( 6.9 %) and vomiting<symptom> ( 6.3 %) in addition to the former signs. The major causes of severe hyperbilirubinaemia were idiopathic ( 33.3 %) , sepsis<disease> ( 35.3 %) , ABO incompatibility ( 17.6 %) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD) deficiency ( 11.8 %). Long-term sequelae on follow-up included delayed developmental milestone attainment , postural deformities , visual and seizure<symptom> disorders. There is urgent need for continued education for mothers , families and healthcare workers on the danger newborns with jaundice could face if not brought early to the hospital for timely diagnosis and management.
