  This study aims to evaluate the percentage of cyto-histologic correlation in patients with a thyroid disease documented through clinical-instrumental , cytological ( FNAB) , histological and surgical examinations. The purpose of this study is also to determine the percentage of disease incidence and evaluating any surgical indication in relation to biological behavior ( benign , malignant or indeterminate lesions<symptom> , occult carcinomas) , sex , and age. Almost all of thyroid neoplasms is manifested through thyroid nodule<disease>. Therefore , clinical evidence of the thyroid nodule<disease> analysis is primarily related to the need to exclude malignant pathology or carcinoma of the thyroid , present in 4-6.5 % of cases. The trial was conducted analyzing the data including cytological and histology thyroid reports recorded from 1 March 2010 to 1 March 2016 , for a total of 5,956 reports. To determine the cyto-histological correlations , have been considered eligible all patients of both sexes , that have performed at least one cytologic exam followed by an histologic exam. Thus , the total number of the cases studied is 554 cases. Cyto-histologic compliance was 93 % with a diagnostic accuracy of 4 % higher than the literature examined. The results thus obtained show , furthermore , that there is a non-negligible percentage of thyroid disease with malignant biological behavior and involvement of male individuals. Therefore , the execution of the FNAB is of utmost importance for the purpose of a correct surgical indication.
