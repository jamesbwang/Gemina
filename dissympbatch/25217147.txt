  The aim of this study was to describe data on epidemiology , ventilatory management , and outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> ( ARDS) in immunocompromised patients. We performed a post hoc analysis on the cohort of immunocompromised patients enrolled in the Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe<disease> Acute<disease> Respiratory<symptom> Failure<symptom> ( LUNG SAFE) study. The LUNG SAFE study was an international , prospective study including hypoxemic patients in 459 ICUs from 50 countries across 5 continents. Of 2813 patients with ARDS , 584 ( 20.8 %) were immunocompromised , 38.9 % of whom had an unspecified cause. Pneumonia<disease> , nonpulmonary sepsis<disease> , and noncardiogenic shock<symptom> were their most common risk factors for ARDS. Hospital mortality was higher in immunocompromised than in immunocompetent patients ( 52.4 % vs 36.2 %; p < 0.0001) , despite similar severity of ARDS. Decisions regarding limiting life-sustaining measures were significantly more frequent in immunocompromised patients ( 27.1 % vs 18.6 %; p < 0.0001). Use of noninvasive ventilation ( NIV) as first-line treatment was higher in immunocompromised patients ( 20.9 % vs 15.9 %; p = 0.0048) , and immunodeficiency remained independently associated with the use of NIV after adjustment for confounders. Forty-eight percent of the patients treated with NIV were intubated , and their mortality was not different from that of the patients invasively ventilated ab initio. Immunosuppression is frequent in patients with ARDS , and infections are the main risk factors for ARDS in these immunocompromised patients. Their management differs from that of immunocompetent patients , particularly the greater use of NIV as first-line ventilation strategy. Compared with immunocompetent subjects , they have higher mortality regardless of ARDS severity as well as a higher frequency of limitation of life-sustaining measures. Nonetheless , nearly half of these patients survive to hospital discharge. ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT02010073. Registered on 12 December 2013.
