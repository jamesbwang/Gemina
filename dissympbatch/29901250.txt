  We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of citicoline add-on therapy in treatment of negative symptoms in patients with stable schizophrenia. In a double-blind and placebo-controlled study , patients with stable schizophrenia ( DSM-5) were randomized to receive either 2,500 mg/day citicoline or placebo in addition to risperidone for 8 weeks. The patients were assessed using the positive and negative syndrome<disease> scale ( PANSS) , the extrapyramidal symptom rating scale ( ESRS) , and Hamilton depression<symptom> rating scale ( HDRS). The primary outcome was the difference in PANSS negative subscale score reduction from baseline to week 8 between the citicoline and the placebo groups. Sixty-six individuals ( out of 73 enrolled) completed the trial. The citicoline group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in negative scores , F ( 1.840 , 118.360) = 8.383 , p = .001 , as well as general psychopathology , F ( 1.219 , 78.012) = 6.636 , p = .008; change in general psychopathology did not remain significant after adjustment , and total PANSS scores , F ( 1.633 , 104.487) = 15.400 , p < .001 , compared with the placebo. HDRS scores and its changes , ESRS score , and frequency of other side effects were not significantly different between the two groups. Citicoline add-on therapy to risperidone can effectively improve the primary negative symptoms of patients with schizophrenia.
