  This report presents the case of an 82 year old male with known dextrocardia and situs inversus totalis who developed increasing dyspnea<symptom> on exertion and was diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement was decided upon requiring deviation from standard techniques for patients with normal anatomy and left-sided aortic arch. We describe two technical differences required for patients with dextrocardia and right-sided aortic arch which facilitate transcatheter aortic valve replacement in this patient group. Dextrocardia is a condition in which there is abnormal embryological looping of the heart such that it is a mirror-image of the usual anatomy. It occurs in less than 1 in 10,000 births and it may be associated with either situs solitus , in which the rest of the organs of the body are in their normal anatomic position , or situs inversus totalis in which all of the body 's organs are in a mirror-image position. Although dextrocardia is associated with other congenital cardiac anomalies as well as Kartagener 's syndrome<disease> it does not usually impair physiology itself thereby allowing many patients to live a normal lifespan.
