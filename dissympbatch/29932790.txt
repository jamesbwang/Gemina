  In Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy ( MDT) , patients with low back pain ( LBP) are classified into subgroups to guide a management strategy. A common subgroup where symptoms improve with lumbar extension is labeled posterior derangement syndrome<disease>. A less common subgroup where symptoms improve with lumbar flexion is labeled anterior derangement syndrome<disease>. The patient was a 23-year-old woman with intermittent LBP and discomfort over the left lower extremity was initially diagnosis with posterior derangement syndrome<disease>. At the initial and second consultations , postural correction and home exercises with lumbar extension were prescribed. However , at the third consultation , sustained lumbar extension revealed worsening of symptoms and function , which resulted in a revised diagnosis of anterior derangement syndrome<disease>. Complete recovery was achieved using exercises with lumbar flexion over 6 weeks. The patient wore the LUMOback in daily life , which is a wearable device measuring pelvic angle and acceleration , for 1 week before the initial MDT consultation and for 6 weeks until discharge. The posture<symptom> scores ( %) is the proportion of time in a week with neutral pelvic tilt. In this patient , the posture<symptom> score decreased greater than a minimum detectable change of 11.7 % when MDT classification changed to anterior derangement. This case report indicates the importance of sustained loading to identify the correct derangement syndrome<disease> , and follow-up sessions to confirm or reject the initial diagnosis by monitoring symptom and functional changes carefully. Habitual posture<symptom> may be associated with reduction and aggravation of symptoms.
