  The functional relevance of OX40 ligand ( OX40L) in the effector phase of crescentic glomerulonephritis<disease> ( GN) is unknown. These studies defined the role of endogenous OX40L during the effector stage of murine crescentic GN. GN was induced by immunization with sheep globulin/adjuvant on Day 0 and injection of sheep anti-mouse glomerular basement membrane immunoglobulin ( Ig) on Day 10. Rat IgG or neutralizing anti-OX40L antibody was administered on Days 10-18 and immune responses and renal injury assessed on Day 20. Compared with naïve animals , OX40L was upregulated in the lymph nodes ( LNs) and on leucocytes and resident non-immune cells in the kidneys of mice with GN. Inhibition of OX40L in GN augmented renal injury , as indicated by increased crescent formation , proteinuria<symptom> and glomerular leucocyte accumulation. In line with increased injury , anti-OX40L treatment increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis of CD4 T cells in the LNs , without affecting LN CD4 cytokine production and CD8 T-cell responses. Blockade of OX40L decreased LN regulatory T-cell ( Treg) proliferation , transforming growth factor β production and foxp3 expression. OX40L inhibition did not affect B cell expansion or circulating antibody levels. In the kidney , neutralization of OX40L augmented interferon γ ( IFNγ) expression by CD4 and CD8 T cells and shifted macrophage polarization towards the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. OX40L is protective during the effector phase of murine crescentic GN by reducing the expansion of CD4 T cells and enhancing Treg responses in the LNs , and by locally inhibiting T-cell IFNγ production and pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype in the kidney.
