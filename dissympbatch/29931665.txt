  Horner 's syndrome<disease> is comprised of a set of symptoms caused by a permanent or transient ipsilateral sympathetic trunk lesion<symptom> or paralysis. It may occur after numerous pathologies in the cervical region , epidural , spinal anaesthesia , and interscalene , transscalene , supraclavicular , or infraclavicular brachial plexus block. The aim of this randomised , prospective clinical study was to evaluate the effect of the interscalene brachial plexus block ( IBPB) technique on the occurrence rate of Horner 's syndrome<disease> and identify contributing risk factors. 108 randomly selected patients of ASA I-III status were scheduled for elective shoulder arthroscopy. The patients received 20 mL of 0.5 % ropivacaine either with ultrasound ( US)- guided IBPB ( U) , peripheral nerve stimulation ( PNS)- confirmation IBPB ( N) , or US-guided , PNS-confirmed IBPB ( dual guidance; NU). We observed that Horner 's syndrome<disease> developed in 12 % of the N group , 6 % of the NU group , and 9 % of the U group. The differences in the rates were not statistically significant ( P = 0.616). Regardless of the technique used to induce IBPB , our study did not demonstrate any particular anthropometric parameter that predisposed the patients to the development of Horner 's syndrome<disease>. Interestingly , our results showed that NU patients with Horner 's syndrome<disease> were significantly younger than NU patients without Horner 's syndrome<disease>. The precision of IBPB by use of the dual guidance technique may reduce the rate of Horner 's syndrome<disease>. The higher water concentration in the prevertebral spaces of younger patients may create better conditions for the diffusion of ropivacaine , which may result in a statistically significant higher HS rate.
