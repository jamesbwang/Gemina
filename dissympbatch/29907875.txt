  Microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome<disease> is a congenital and neurodevelopmental disorder caused by biallelic mutations in the STAMBP gene. Here we identify the novel homozygous mutation located in the SH3 binding motif of STAMBP ( NM_006463.4) ( c. 707C > T: p.Ser236Phe) through whole-exome sequencing. The case patient was a 2-year-old boy showing severe global developmental delay , progressive microcephaly , refractory seizures<symptom> , dysmorphic facial features , and multiple capillary malformations. Immunoblot analysis of patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs) revealed a severe reduction in STAMBP expression , indicating that Ser236Phe induces protein instability. STAMBP interacts with the SH3 domain of STAM and transduces downstream signals from the Jaks-STAM complex. The substitution of Ser236Phe found in the case patient was located in the SH3-binding motif , and we propose the mutation may block STAM binding and subsequently induce STAMBP degradation. Contrary to previously reported STAMBP mutations , the Ser236Phe mutation did not lead to constitutive activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in patient-derived LCLs , as indicated by the expression of phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein , suggesting that it is not the major pathomechanism underlying the disorder in this patient.
