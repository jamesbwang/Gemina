  Kimmerle anomaly is characterised by ossification of the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane with formation of a complete or incomplete bony ridge in the area of the groove for the vertebral artery ( VA) ( ponticulus posticus , PP). In some cases , the bony ridge may also be formed at the level of the VA emerging from the transverse process of the 小1 vertebra ( ponticulus lateralis , PL). The simultaneous one-sided formation of PL and PP is very rare. There are no literature data concerning surgical treatment for compression of the VA due to PL. A 34-year-old female patient presented with the chief complaint of continuous onset of significant dizziness<symptom> to the point of losing consciousness<symptom> while rotating her head<symptom> to the left. Computed tomography angiography of the cervical spine revealed 小1 anomaly with the formation of PP and PL with acute-angled 小-shaped kinking of the VA.. The patient underwent resection of these bony ridges through a minimally invasive lateral ( PP) approach and far-lateral ( PL) approach. The treatment led to significant improvement in quality of life , with disappearance of the pain syndrome<disease> via the 小1 spinal root and absence of bow hunters syndrome<disease> in the postoperative period. To our knowledge , this is the first report on the surgical treatment of VA compression due to PP and PL. The decompression of VA in such cases can be performed via two separated minimally invasive lateral and far-lateral approaches. Active surgical strategies for the treatment of Kimmerle anomaly may significantly improve patients ' quality of life.
