  Aerosol particles emitted from various human activities deteriorate air quality and are suggested to increase public health risk. Numerous studies have emphasized the relationship between the mass and/or number concentration of aerosols ( or commonly known as particulate matter ( PM)) in the atmosphere and the incidence of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases , while very few have examined the deposition efficiency of inhaled particles in the respiratory<disease> tract<symptom>. We present the first examination of particles deposition based on , detailed simulation of aerosol physico-chemical properties by a recently developed particle-resolved aerosol model and the mixing state dependent hygrosocpic growth and deposition computed at particle-level by deposition model. Furthermore , we elucidate the impact of mixing state on deposition efficiency by using a recently introduced aerosol mixing state index. We find that without considering mixing-state-dependent hygroscopic growth of particles leads to overestimation of deposition efficiency; whereas considering an average mixing state leads to underestimation of 5 % to 20 % of soot particle deposition efficiency in human alveoli. We conclude that aerosol mixing state , which evolves during the interaction between atmospheric chemistry and meteorology , is important for the comprehensive evaluation of air quality and its implication to public health requires further investigation.
