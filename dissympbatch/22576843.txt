  A patient with a rare pediatric insulinoma and MEN1 syndrome<disease> was treated by robotic enucleation surgery. We present a case of a 9-year-old girl presenting with repeated loss of consciousness<symptom> , concomitant with a pale face , palpitations , and convulsions<symptom> , which had persisted for 2 years and had been aggravated during the previous 2 months. She was previously misdiagnosed with epilepsy in another hospital. We further examined her while she was hospitalized. By combining her medical history and imaging examination and lab test results , a diagnosis of insulinoma was confirmed. Sanger-directed sequencing on a peripheral blood sample revealed an MEN1 gene mutation , indicating pediatric insulinoma with MEN1 syndrome<disease>. The patient underwent minimally invasive insulinoma enucleation surgery under the Da Vinci robot-assisted system with intraoperative ultrasound ( IOUS) connected. The surgery was successfully completed within 65 min , and the girl recovered well postoperatively and no longer experienced symptoms of hypoglycemia. This is the first report of a case of pediatric insulinoma treated using robotic enucleation. This experience demonstrates the feasibility and safety of combining robotic surgery with the enucleation procedure as an excellent strategy for pediatric insulinoma.
