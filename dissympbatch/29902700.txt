  Ticagrelor reduces cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS). Recent studies demonstrated the expression of P2Y12 on vascular cells including endothelial cells , as well as platelets , and suggested its contribution to atherogenesis. We investigated whether ticagrelor attenuates vascular dysfunction and inhibits atherogenesis in apolipoprotein E-deficient ( apoe Eight-week-old male apoe Ticagrelor treatment for 20 weeks attenuated atherosclerotic lesion<symptom> progression in the aortic arch compared with control ( p < 0.05). Ticagrelor administration for 8 weeks attenuated endothelial dysfunction ( p < 0.01). Ticagrelor reduced the expression of inflammatory molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 , macrophage accumulation , and lipid deposition. Ticagrelor decreased the phosphorylation of JNK in the aorta compared with control ( p < 0.05). Ticagrelor and a JNK inhibitor ameliorated impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation by adenosine diphosphate ( ADP) in wild-type mouse aortic segments. Furthermore , ticagrelor inhibited the expression of inflammatory molecules which were promoted by ADP in HUVEC ( p < 0.001). Ticagrelor also inhibited ADP-induced JNK activation in HUVEC ( p < 0.05). Ticagrelor attenuated vascular dysfunction and atherogenesis through the inhibition of inflammatory activation of endothelial cells. These effects might be a potential mechanism by which ticagrelor decreases cardiovascular events in patients with ACS.
