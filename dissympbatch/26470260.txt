  Heat shock<symptom> proteins ( Hsps) are prominent proteins that greatly contribute to insect survival under stress conditions. In this study , we cloned two Hsp transcripts ( Aohsp70 and Aohsp90) from the grass thrip , Anaphothrips obscurus ( Müller) ( Thysanoptera: Thripidae) , which is a polymorphic winged pest of corn and wheat. The cDNA sequences of Aohsp70 and Aohsp90 are 2382 and 2504 bp long , and encode proteins with calculated molecular weights of 70.02 kDa and 83.40 kDa , respectively. Aohsp90 was highly expressed in adults of both brachypters and macropters. Aohsp70 had different expression patterns in brachypters and macropters and was also highly expressed in the pupae of macropters. After adults were exposed to an ascending series of heat shocks<disease> , the expression of both Aohsp70 and Aohsp90 were up-regulated. In macropters and brachypters , the maximum induced levels of Aohsp70 ( approximately 90-fold and 280-fold , respectively) were higher than Aohsp90 ( approximately 2.4-fold and 1.8-fold , respectively). In addition , the up-regulation of Aohsp70 was significantly higher in brachypters than in macropters. Brachypters had a significantly higher Ltem50 ( 43.2 °C) than macropters ( 42.5 °C) , which implied that brachypters are more tolerant to thermal stress than macropters. This study has shown that the expression patterns of Aohsp70 and Aohsp90 are variable among different life stages and thermal stress induced different levels of expressions in macropterous and brachypterous adults.
