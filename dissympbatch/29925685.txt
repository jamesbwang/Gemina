  The gut-liver axis is of clinical importance as a potential therapeutic target in a wide range of liver diseases; however , the mechanisms underlying interactions between microbial products and immune responses in the liver remain unknown. In this study , we demonstrated that IL-10-producing macrophages contribute to immune tolerance in the inflamed liver under intestinal barrier disruption in a murine tandem model of dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS) colitis<disease> and concanavalin A ( Con A) hepatitis<disease>. Intestinal barrier disruption protected mice from subsequent liver injury , and the severity of colitis<disease> directly affected susceptibility to such injury. The protective effect of DSS-Con A was canceled in gut-sterilized mice , suggesting that gut microbiota play a substantial role in this process. Altered gut microbiota and their metabolites , along with a disrupted intestinal barrier , directly gave rise to immunological permissiveness in the inflamed liver. We identified 1-methylnicotinamide ( 1-MNA) as a candidate metabolite capable of suppressing liver injury with the potential to induce IL-10-producing macrophages. Consistently , expression of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase , which converts nicotinamide to 1-MNA , was upregulated in the liver of DSS-Con A mice , and this effect was abrogated by gut sterilization. Collectively , our results provide a mechanistic insight into the regulation of immunological balance<symptom> in the liver via the gut-liver axis.
