  Spitz nevus commonly appears as a solitary lesion<symptom>. A 12-year-old male patient presented with a 6-month history of several pigmented lesions<symptom> on his trunk and lower extremities. He had undergone chemoradiotherapy and unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation against recurring acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> for 6 years. After that , several pigmented lesions<symptom> abruptly developed on his trunk and lower extremities , and the number of those increased significantly. Pathologically , the diagnosis of multiple Spitz nevi was made. In a clinical correlation , we diagnosed multiple Spitz nevi resulting from such an immunocompromised condition. This is the first description of clinical , dermoscopic , and histopathologic features of multiple Spitz nevi in the hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HSCT) recipient child.
