  Given importance of 22-Fanconi Anemia<symptom> ( FA) proteins together to act in a signaling pathway in preventing deleterious clinical symptoms , e.g. severe bone<disease> marrow failure , congenital defects , an early onset of aging and cancer , studies on each FA protein become increasingly attractive. However , an unbiased and systematic investigation of cellular effects resulting from each FA protein is missing. Here , we report roles of FA complementation C group protein ( FANCC) in the protection from metabolic disorders. This study was prompted by the diabetes-prone feature displayed in FANCC knockout mice , which is not typically shown in patients with FA. We found that in cells expressing FANCC at different levels , there are representative alterations in metabolites associated with aging ( glycine , citrulline , ornithine<disease> , L-asparagine , L-tyrosine , L-arginine , L-glutamine , L-leucine , L-isoleucine , L-valine , L-proline and L-alanine) , Diabetes Mellitus ( DM) ( carbon monoxide , collagens , fatty acids , D-glucose , fumaric acid , 2-oxoglutaric acid , C3) , inflammation<symptom> ( inosine , L-arginine , L-isoleucine , L-leucine , L-lysine , L-phenylalanine , hypoxanthine , L-methionine) , and cancer ( L-methionine , sphingomyelin , acetyl-L-carnitine , L-aspartic acid , L-glutamic acid , niacinamide , phospho-rylethanolamine). We also found that FANCC can act in an FA-pathway-independent manner in tumor suppression. Collectively , featured-metabolic alterations are readouts of functional mechanisms underlying reduced tumorigenicity driven by FANCC , demonstrating close links among cancer , aging , inflammation<symptom> and DM.
