  Leprosy<disease> is a chronic infectious<disease> disease<disease> that mainly affects the skin , mucous<symptom> membranes<symptom> , and peripheral nervous system. The clinical manifestations of leprosy<disease> are numerous and polymorphic with the most frequent signs involving skin and neurological damage. Some of its manifestations , such as joint<symptom> pain<symptom> , are unusual. Its elimination as a public health problem in many countries seems to lead to a lack of practical knowledge among health care personnel and as a consequence a risk of late diagnosis. As in other countries , leprosy<disease> has become rare in Mauritania. We report two cases of misdiagnosed leprosy<disease> in two male patients aged 17 and 65 years. Clinical manifestations included polyarthritis , bilateral plantar perforation , and severely deformed hands and feet in the first case and lichenoid lesions<symptom> , hypopigmented papules , and unilateral bronchial rales<symptom> in the second case. The duration of development and persistence of clinical signs before establishment of correct diagnosis was seven to ten years despite the presence of anesthetic , hypochromic maculopapular skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> and neurologic signs suggestive of leprosy<disease> in both cases. A multilevel chemotherapeutic regimen recommended by the World Health Organization ( WHO) was effective , and the patients ' condition evolved satisfactorily. The scarcity of leprosy<disease> in our health care facilities often leads to a wrong diagnosis. It is imperative to inform physicians to increase their vigilance for appropriate screening and reporting of these cases. The prognosis depends largely on early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
