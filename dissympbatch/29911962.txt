  Evans syndrome<disease> is an uncommon disease characterized by a combination of autoimmune hemolytic<symptom> anemia<symptom> and autoimmune thrombocytopenia<symptom> concomitantly or sequentially with a positive direct Coombs test in the absence of any underlying known cause. Here , we present a case of an adult patient who underwent living-donor liver transplant that was preceded by bone<disease> marrow transplant 20 years earlier from the same HLA identical donor and who received a single-agent immunosuppressive therapy for only 2 months as prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease. Two months after transplant , he developed Evans syndrome<disease> with severe anemia<symptom> and thrombocytopenia<symptom>. After administration of steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin , the patient 's anemia<symptom> and thrombocytopenia<symptom> improved dramatically. Through the 7 years of follow-up , the patient has not developed graft-versus-host disease or acute or chronic rejection. This case demonstrates a rare complication posttransplant and the possibility of functional tolerance of liver grafts after a combined liver and bone<disease> marrow transplant from the same donor.
