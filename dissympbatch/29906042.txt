  Umbilical endometriosis or Villar 's nodule<disease> is uncommon. Incidence goes up to 0.5-1.2 % of all patients with endometriosis. As far as 2012 , only 109 cases of umbilical endometriosis have been reported worldwide , there is no incidence reports in Mexico. Clinically , it 's a solitary node , solid and well defined , colored red , blue or black and it 's ocassionally accompanied by bleeding and dysmenorrhea. The treatment can be medical or surgical and it consists of painkillers , and hormonal suppression using GnRH analogues , hormonal contraceptives , danazol or progesterone. Surgical treatment consists in complete resection of the umbilical lesion<symptom>. The aim of this paper is to present a clinical report case and have a bibliographic review of this pathology. A 34 year-old patient comes to the clinic due to severe umbilical pain of some months , associated with enlargement , swelling and cyclic menstrual bleeding. Escision of the lesion<symptom> is performed and sent to pathology having the diagnosis of umbilical endometriosis. There is no evidence of endometriosic implants under laparoscopic control. Regards of being a rare pathology , umbilical endometriosis must be taken as a differential diagnosis in patients with umbilical lesions<symptom> associated with menstrual cycle pain.
