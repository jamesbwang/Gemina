  Our objective was to examine international similarities and differences in the Dysregulation Profile ( DP) of the Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL) , Teacher 's Report Form ( TRF) , and Youth Self-Report ( YSR) via comparisons of data from many societies. Primary samples were those studied by Rescorla et al. ( 2012): CBCL: N = 69,866 , 42 societies; YSR: N = 38,070 , 34 societies; TRF: N = 37,244 , 27 societies. Omnicultural Q correlations of items composing the DP ( from the Anxious/Depressed , Attention Problems , and Aggressive<symptom> Behavior<symptom> syndromes<disease>) indicated considerable consistency across diverse societies with respect to which of the DP items tended to receive low , medium , or high ratings , whether ratings were provided by parents ( M Q = .70) , adolescents ( M Q = .72) , or teachers ( M Q = .68). Omnicultural mean item ratings indicated that , for all 3 forms , the most common items on the DP reflect a mix of problems from all 3 constituent scales. Cross-informant analyses for the CBCL-YSR and CBCL-TRF supported these results. Aggregated DP scores , derived by summing ratings on all DP items , varied significantly by society. Age and gender differences were minor for all 3 forms , but boys scored higher than girls on the TRF. Many societies differing in ethnicity , religion , political/economic system , and geographical region manifested very similar DP scores. The most commonly reported DP problems reflected the mixed symptom picture of the DP , with dysregulation in mood , attention , and aggression. Overall , societies were more similar than different on DP scale scores and item ratings.
