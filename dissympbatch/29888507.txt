  Fibrosis<disease> is thought to be the main pathophysiology of scleroderma , and myofibroblasts play the main role in abnormal fibrotic pathologies. Altered distribution of dermal dendritic cells ( DDCs) and vascular abnormalities has been reported to relate to the pathogenesis of scleroderma. To investigate fibrotic pathogenesis of morphea ( localized scleroderma) by demonstrating the relative expression and distribution of DDCs and myofibroblasts , we performed immunohistochemical stains using several relevant antibodies. Skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> of 50 patients with morphea and age- , sex- and site-matched normal skin of 50 subjects were evaluated for the following antibodies: CD34 , factor XIIIa ( FXIIIa) , smooth muscle actin ( SMA) , CD31 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1). CD34 stromal stain was significantly lower in patients than controls ( P = 0.000) , while FXIIIa , SMA and VCAM-1 stains were significantly higher in patients than controls ( P = 0.043 , P = 0.000 and P = 0.027 , respectively). In subtype analysis within patients , CD34 stromal stain showed decreasing trends with increasing disease extent and increasing fibrosis<disease> , respectively. CD34 stromal stain showed an inverse correlation and mutually exclusive spatial expression pattern with SMA stain ( r = -0.286 , P = 0.044). The inverse relationship was maintained in each dermal layer analysis , upper and lower dermis ( r = -0.397 , P = 0.004 and r = -0.281 , P = 0.048 , respectively). Mutually exclusive staining patterns of CD34 stromal and SMA stains suggest a phenotypic change of CD34 + DDCs into SMA + myofibroblasts with increasing disease extent and fibrosis<disease> in morphea. Degree of loss of CD34 + DDCs can be a useful marker in predicting the extent and severity of morphea.
