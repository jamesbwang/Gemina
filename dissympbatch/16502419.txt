  Cancer cachexia is characterized by extreme skeletal muscle<symptom> loss<symptom> that results in high morbidity and mortality. The incidence of cachexia varies among tumor types , being lowest in sarcomas<disease> , whereas 90 % of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC) patients experience severe<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom>. How these tumors trigger muscle depletion is still unfolding. Serendipitously , we found that overexpression of Twist1 in mouse muscle progenitor cells , either constitutively during development or inducibly in adult animals , caused severe muscle atrophy with features reminiscent of cachexia. Using several genetic mouse models of PDAC , we detected a marked increase in Twist1 expression in muscle undergoing cachexia. In cancer patients , elevated levels of Twist1 are associated with greater degrees of muscle wasting. Finally , both genetic and pharmacological inactivation of Twist1 in muscle progenitor cells afforded substantial protection against cancer-mediated cachexia , which translated into meaningful survival benefits , implicating Twist1 as a possible target for attenuating muscle cachexia in cancer patients.
