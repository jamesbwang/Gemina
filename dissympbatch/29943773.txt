  Radiotherapy is one of the main treatment options used in pelvic cancers. Ionizing radiation induces damage to surrounding tissues , resulting in disruption of normal physiological functions and symptoms such as diarrhea<disease> , tenesmus<symptom> , incontinence , and rectal bleeding , which can all significantly alter the patient 's quality of life. These patients are at increased risk of developing protein-calorie malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. Therefore , designing a proper nutritional intervention plan , with an optimal proportion of protein , fat , and carbohydrates , is required to reduce or even reverse the patients ' poor nutritional status , increase their tolerance and response to oncology treatment , decrease the rate of complications and improve their quality of life. The aim of this review was to establish a nutritional plan that includes recommendations on macronutrient proportions and micronutrient intake in patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. The following nutritional plan has been recommended in the literature: Energy: 28-31 kcal/kg/day , using the Harris-Benedict formula adjusted for body<symptom> weight in obese patients; protein: 20-30 %; fat: 30-40 %; and carbohydrates: 40-50 %. The maintenance of adequate levels of Vitamin D , Vitamin E , Vitamin A , calcium , magnesium , thiamin , riboflavin , and niacin must be emphasized. Physical activity must also be increased to maintain muscle mass. Nutrient requirements must be established in an integral manner , considering the patient 's age , nutritional status , and the presence of comorbidities. Unnecessary dietary restrictions should be avoided to ensure an adequate nutritional status.
