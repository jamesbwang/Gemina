  The aim of this study is to describe a less aggressive approach to management of positive nipple margin following nipple-sparing mastectomy ( NSM) , allowing for preservation of the nipple-areolar complex ( NAC). A single-institution retrospective chart review was performed for patients undergoing NSM from 1989 to 2017. Positive nipple margin was defined as any residual invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS) within the additional nipple margin. Management included complete NAC removal , subareolar shave biopsy , or observation alone. Primary outcomes included rates of positive nipple margin and local recurrence. A total of 819 breasts<disease> underwent NSM , yielding a total of 32 breasts<disease> ( 3.9 %) with positive nipple margin. Management included 11 ( 34.4 %) subareolar shave biopsies , 15 ( 46.9 %) complete NAC excisions , and 5 ( 15.6 %) with observation alone , plus 1 ( 3.1 %) lost to follow-up. Final pathology after subareolar shave biopsy did not reveal any residual disease , and no patients developed NAC necrosis<symptom> or required NAC removal. Final pathology after NAC excision revealed 3 of 15 with additional disease ( 1 invasive ductal carcinoma , 2 DCIS). Of the five patients who had no subsequent intervention , tumor pathology was DCIS in all cases. One patient received adjuvant radiation therapy. Mean time to intervention was 3.7 Â± 1.9 with mean follow-up of 2.9 years. Management of positive nipple margin after NSM with subareolar shave biopsy is a safe alternative to preserve the NAC.
