  Echo-attenuated plaque ( EA) on intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS) is related to poor outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) in acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) patients. However , the clinical significance of EA in stable angina pectoris ( SAP) patients compared with that in ACS patients remains unclear. We assessed the relationships between EA and unstable plaque characteristics in patients with ACS and SAP. We investigated 609 coronary lesions<symptom> in 609 patients ( 234 with ACS; 375 with SAP) undergoing pre-intervention IVUS and optical coherence tomography ( OCT). The differences in plaque morphology and post-PCI outcomes were assessed according to the clinical status of ACS or SAP and the presence or absence of EA. EA was more frequent in patients with ACS than in those with SAP ( 44.0 % vs. 25.1 % , p < 0.001). SAP-EA lesions<symptom> showed thicker fibrous cap ( 157 ± 97 μm vs. 100 ± 58 μm , p < 0.001) , smaller lipid arc ( 208 ± 76 ° vs. 266 ± 99 ° , p < 0.001) , smaller plaque burden ( 83.0 ± 6.1 % vs. 86.5 ± 4.1 % , p < 0.001) , and lower frequency of transient slow-reflow phenomenon during PCI ( 21.3 % vs. 51.5 % , p < 0.001) than ACS-EA lesions<symptom> , but similar plaque vulnerability compared with ACS-non-EA lesions<symptom>. SAP-EA lesions<symptom> had less frequent OCT-thrombus than ACS-non-EA lesions<symptom> ( 20.2 % vs. 71.2 % , p < 0.001). SAP-EA lesions<symptom> had less plaque vulnerability than ACS-EA lesions<symptom> , but were comparable to ACS-non-EA lesions<symptom>. Less frequent thrombus formation might differentiate SAP-EA lesions<symptom> from ACS-non-EA lesions<symptom>. A combined IVUS and OCT approach might be useful to assess plaque vulnerability in SAP-EA lesions<symptom> compared with ACS
