  An aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> is defined as a balloon-shaped bulging of all three histologic components of the aortic vessel walls ( intima , media and adventitia). This dilation results from vessel weakening owing to remodeling , i.e. due to cystic degeneration of the Tunica media ( Marfan) , progression of atherosclerosis or presence of a bicuspid aortic valve. The growth rate of the aortic diameter varies from patient to patient and may progress until the aneurysm<disease> ultimately ruptures. The role of hemodynamics , i.e. blood flow patterns , and shear stresses that are supposed to intensify during aneurysm<disease> growth are not yet fully understood , but thought to play a key role in the enlargement process. The aim of this study is to characterize the aortic blood flow in a silicone model of a pathological aorta with ascending aneurysm<disease> , to analyze the differences in the blood flow pattern compared to a healthy aortic model , and to single out possible blood flow characteristics measurable using phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) that could serve as indicators for aneurysm<disease> severity. MRI simulations were performed under physiological , pulsatile flow conditions using data obtained from optical three dimensional particle tracking measurements. In comparison to the healthy geometry , elevated turbulence intensity and pressure loss<symptom> are measured in the diseased aorta , which we propose as a complimentary indicator for assessing the aneurysmal severity. Our results shed a light on the interplay between the blood flow dynamics and their contribution to the pathophysiology and possible role for future risk assessment of ascending
