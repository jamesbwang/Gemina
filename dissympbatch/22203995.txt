  T cell function in cancer patients is usually impaired due to the constitutive activation of immune checkpoint inhibitors. This state is known as ` exhaustion<symptom> ' and is often associated with the inefficient control of tumors or persistent infections. In this work , we investigated the role of leukemia<disease> cell-derived microvesicles ( MVs) in T cell exhaustion<symptom>. Following incubation with MVs from various sources , all T cell subtypes exhibited the exhaustion<symptom> phonotype and impaired cytokine secretion in vitro. Mice models also showed the connection between immune checkpoint inhibitors and MV injection. Sequencing and bioinformatics analyses indicated that a number of transcription factors and microRNAs ( miRNAs) were attributable to the dysregulation of pathways and exhaustion<symptom> in T cells. Further work revealed that functional miR-92a-3p , miR-21-5p , miR-16-5p , miR-126 and miR-182-5p in MVs could be delivered into T cells to induce the exhaustion<symptom> phenotype. SerpinB2 , IL-1β and CXCL5 , which are mediators of the NF-κB pathway , were identified as the targets of the miRNAs mentioned above. We demonstrated that leukemia-derived MVs could initiate T cell exhaustion<symptom> via the progressive temporal delivery of multiple exogenous miRNAs into T cells and the subsequent interaction of these miRNAs with their targets. Therefore , MVs can be expected not only to become new indicators of the T cell status in patients but also to be used as novel targets for personalized patient treatment.
