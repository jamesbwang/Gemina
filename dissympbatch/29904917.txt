  The dynamic balance<symptom> between bone resorption and bone formation is crucial to maintain bone mass. Osteoclasts are key cells that perform bone resorption while osteoblasts and osteocytes function in bone formation. Osteoporosis , a bone metabolism disease characterized by bone loss and degradation of bone microstructure , occurs when osteoclastic bone resorption outstrips osteoblastic bone synthesis. The interaction between receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand ( RANKL) and RANK on the surface of bone<disease> marrow macrophages promotes osteoclast differentiation and activation. In this study , we found that lumichrome , a photodegradation product of riboflavin , inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption as determined by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining , immunofluorescence , reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction , and western blot. Our results showed that lumichrome represses the expression of osteoclast marker genes , including cathepsin K ( Ctsk) and Nfatc1. In addition , lumichrome suppressed RANKL-induced calcium oscillations , NFATc1 , NF-κB , and MAPK signaling activation. Moreover , lumichrome promoted osteoblast differentiation at an early stage , as demonstrated by upregulated expression of osteoblast marker genes Alp , Runx2 , and Col1a1. We also found that lumichrome reduces bone loss in ovariectomized mice by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. In summary , our data suggest the potential of lumichrome as a therapeutic drug for osteolytic diseases.
