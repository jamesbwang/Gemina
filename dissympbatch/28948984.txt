  To identify features associated with long-term persistent remission in rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) patients on tapered biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( bDMARD) ( tap-bDMARD) therapy. We carried out a 40-month ( m) extension follow-up study of 77 RA patients from a previous 12 m tap-bDMARD study. Disease activity was assessed at baseline and every 3 months. Doppler US investigation of 42 joints for the presence and grade ( 0-3) of B-mode synovial hypertrophy ( SH) and synovial power Doppler signal ( i.e. , Doppler synovitis<symptom>) was performed before starting the tap-bDMARD strategy by a rheumatologist blinded to clinical and laboratory data. At the 40 m mark , 44 ( 57.1 %) patients failed the tap-bDMARD strategy , while 33 ( 42.9 %) succeeded. Patients who presented a failed tap-bDMARD had significantly longer disease duration , a longer time from symptom onset to synthetic ( s) DMARD start , longer duration of sDMARD treatment , a greater number of sDMARDs , and a higher baseline DAS28 and SDAI than patients with successful tap-bDMARD at 40 months. In logistic regression analysis , the presence of baseline Doppler synovitis<symptom> , a DAS28 â‰¥ 2.2 , and the presence of rheumatoid factor were identified as predictors of tap-bDMARD failure at 40 m. In those patients who succeed tap-bDMARD at 12 m , a smoking habit was significantly more frequently found in tap-bDMARD failures at 40 m. Our results showed that DAS28 and the presence of Doppler synovitis<symptom> , RF and a smoking habit predicted long-term tap-bDMARD failure.
