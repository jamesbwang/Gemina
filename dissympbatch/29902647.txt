  Patients with bile acid diarrhea<disease> ( BAD) are identified based on increased levels of BAs in fecal samples collected over a 48-hr period while on a 100-gram fat diet ( 48-hr BA) , retention of We performed a retrospective study of 64 patients with IBS-D , 30 patients with IBS-constipation , 30 healthy volunteers ( controls). We collected data on fecal weights ( measured over a 48-hr period) , colonic transit over a 24-hr period ( measured by scintigraphy) , and percentages of different BAs in stool<symptom> samples. Colonic transit was measured as the geometric center ( weighted average) of colonic counts on a scale of 1 ( 100 % in ascending colon) to 5 ( 100 % in stool<symptom>). We performed area under the curve ( AUC) analyses to assess the association between result of serum and stool<symptom> tests and high fecal weight ( > 400g/48 hrs) or rapid colonic transit ( > 3.34 , corresponding to isotope geometric center in sigmoid colon). We estimated the prevalence of increased 48-hr fecal BAs among 938 patients with chronic diarrhea<disease> Total fecal 48-hr BA alone , or in combination with percentage of primary fecal BAs , identified patients with increased fecal weight with an AUROC of 0.86. Percentage of primary fecal BA alone identified patients with increased fecal weight with an AUROC of 0.73. Total fecal 48-hr BA alone identified patients with increased colonic transit with an AUROC of 0.65 and percentage of primary fecal BA alone identified patients with increased colonic transit with an AUROC of 0.69; combined data on these features identified patients with increased colonic transit with an AUROC of 0.70. Serum level of C4 identified patients with increased colonic transit with an AUROC of 0.60. Primary BAs > 10 % identified patients with increased fecal weight ( sensitivity 49 % and specificity 91 %) and rapid colonic transit ( sensitivity 48 % and specificity 87 %). Among the patients with chronic diarrhea<disease> , 45.6 % had fecal primary BAs > 10 % and 27 % had increased total fecal BAs ( > 2337 Î¼mol/48 hrs). In a retrospective analysis of patients with IBS-D , we found percentage of primary BAs in fecal samples to provide an alternative to total fecal BAs in identification of patients with BAD or chronic
