  Second-degree burn injury is the most common type of burn injury , which usually takes 2-3 weeks for complete healing. However , such patients suffer with intense<symptom> pain<symptom> associated with development of hyperalgesia and allodynia. Here , we prepare a silver clay patch using montmorillonite clay , betaine , and silver nitrate. Later , the silver clay patches were loaded with fentanyl. Furthermore , the patches were fabricated into burn wound<disease> dressings. The dressings were first subjected to ex vivo skin penetration studies and were later evaluated for thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia using second-degree burn injury rodent model. Our results show that application of fentanyl-loaded dermal clay ( FLDC) dressings for 3 h showed significant increase of paw withdrawal latency ( p < 0.001) against hyperalgesia starting from 30 min after removal of patch to up to 6 h. Similarly , the FLDC dressings also potentiated the paw withdrawal threshold for up to 4 h after application ( p < 0.001). From these studies , we can conclude that FLDC dressings are ideal topical formulations for better management of pain in second-degree burns.
