  The aim of this study was to determine the in-hospital survival of patients referred to the 2 stroke centers in North-West of Iran during a full seasonal year from April 2015. All the consecutive patients with stroke admitted to the 2 main stroke centers at Tabriz ( Imam Reza University Hospital and Razi University Hospital) were recruited in this study. Stroke patients from both ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes were selected based on the registry data and International Classification of Diseases , 10th edition. At admission , details of examination including vital signs , neurologic and systemic examination , Modified Rankin Scale , and Glasgow Coma<symptom> Scale were recorded. Baseline hematological and biochemical parameter assessments as well as computerized tomographic scanning were conducted. Cox regression was used to investigate and detect potential predictors of in-hospital survival. A total of 1,990 patients with stroke were studied. Males comprised 52.1 % ( 1,036) of the subjects. The mean age of the patients was 65.8 years. Three hundred and fifty-seven ( 17.9 %) patients had hemorrhagic stroke vs 1,633 ( 82.1 %) with ischemic stroke. In-hospital case-fatality proportion was 12.5 % ( 95 % CI: 11.1-14). Based on modified Rankin Scale score at admission , 1,377 of 1,990 patients ( 69.2 %) had a poor outcome ( modified Rankin Scale score ≥ 3) at the admission time. The regression analysis showed that at least 7 variables could independently predict hospital survival of patients with stroke including age ≥ 65 years , higher admission modified Rankin Scale score , lower admission Glasgow Coma<symptom> Scale score , hemorrhagic stroke nature , diabetes , having valvular heart disease , and having aspiration pneumonia<disease> The case-fatality of stroke in the present study setting is high and needs to be appropriately addressed through prevention or management of some of these factors such as diabetes , pneumonia<disease> , and valvular heart diseases.
