  To establish stable infliximab-expressing Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO) cells with high tolerance to serum-free culture. Bcl-2 antagonist/killer 1 ( BAK1) , which is a key mediator of the apoptosis pathway , was disrupted , and infliximab , which is a broadly used monoclonal antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis<disease> and other autoimmune diseases , was incorporated into the BAK1 locus of the CHO chromosome using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR)/ Cas genome-editing technique. The activating effects of serum starvation on BAK1 and cytochrome C ( CytC) were suppressed in the genome-edited cells , and the ability of the cells to resist the serum starvation-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis was increased , as indicated by the results of polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) , flow cytometry , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) and high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) analysis. In addition , during subsequent passages , infliximab could be stably produced in the genome-edited CHO cells , and the recombinant antibody could effectively antagonize the cytotoxic effect of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α ( TNFα). A CHO cell line capable of stably expressing infliximab and adapting to serum-free culture was constructed. This work lays the foundation for the development of infliximab biosimilars.
