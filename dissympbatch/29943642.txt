  B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( BCP-ALL) is the most common malignancy in childhood. Despite the high cure-rate , identifying new druggable molecular targets is still of great interest. In a cohort of BCP-ALL pediatric patients , irrespectively of the molecule/karyotype lesions<symptom> found , we recently observed high expression of c-Myc and Che-1/ AATF , which disappears at time of remission. Study of the molecular mechanisms involved in this co-expression revealed that Che-1 expression was crucial for induction of blast-cell proliferation driven by c-Myc. Furthermore , Che-1/ AATF silencing in primary BCP-ALL cell lines improves responsiveness to chemotherapy. These data individuate Che-1 as a possible novel target in the treatment of BCP-ALL able to affect c-Myc-driven tumorigenicity.
