  A referring hospital diagnosed a 57-year-old man with a pancreatic head mass. The initial endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA) was inconclusive because of the small sample size. Endoscopic ultrasonography elastography ( EUS-EG) and contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasonography ( CE-EUS) , conducted at our institute , raised the possibility of mass-forming pancreatitis<disease> or autoimmune pancreatitis<disease> ( AIP). A repeat EUS-FNA revealed inflammatory changes , including a neutrophilic duct injury suggestive of type 2 AIP. The pancreatic lesion<symptom> responded well to the steroid therapy. The present case suggests that EUS-EG and CE-EUS may be useful for diagnostic exclusion of pancreatic cancers , and the combined use of EUS-EG and CE-EUS , with EUS-FNA , may help characterize inflammatory pancreatic
