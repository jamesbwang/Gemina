  Inflammatory<symptom> pain<symptom> is known to severely impact the life quality of patients. Notably , dezocine is widely used for the treatment of pain. Therefore , the current study aimed to examine the effects of dezocine on a complete Freund 's adjuvant ( CFA)- induced inflammatory<symptom> pain<symptom> model in rats and to investigate the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. Rats were randomly divided into three groups , including the control , CFA and dezocine + CFA groups , and then subcutaneously injected with 100 µl saline , subcutaneously injected with 100 µl CFA or pretreated with 1 ml dezocine ( 0.4 µg/kg) at 30 min before CFA injection in the plantar surface of right hind paw , respectively. The paw withdrawal threshold ( PWT) and paw withdrawal latency ( PWL) were measured with a dynamic plantar esthesiometer at 1 day before and 6 h after CFA injection. The ipsilateral lumbar spinal<disease> cords<disease> of all the rats were harvested for detecting the expression profiles of phosphorylated ( p)- p65 , p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( p-ERK1/ 2) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2) , interleukin ( IL) -1 β and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α by western blot analysis and/or reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition , prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2) expression was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Compared with the control group , CFA-induced peripheral inflammation<symptom> downregulated the PWT and PWL values of rats , which were significantly alleviated by dezocine treatment. Furthermore , the protein levels of p-p65 , p-ERK1/ 2 , COX-2 , PGE2 , IL-1β and TNF-α were significantly upregulated following CFA injection , while they were suppressed by dezocine pretreatment. In conclusion , the analgesic effect of dezocine on inflammatory<symptom> pain<symptom> induced by CFA may be associated with the inhibition of the spinal ERK1/2-COX -2 pathway.
