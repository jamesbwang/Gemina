  Congenital ventricular aneurysms<disease> and diverticula are rare congenital heart diseases , currently accessible to prenatal diagnosis. Information on the natural course of ventricular aneurysm<disease> or diverticulum detected during fetal life is limited as there are only few case reports and case series enumerating the defect. We aimed to describe through three cases , the prenatal features and clinical outcomes of fetal cardiac aneurysms<disease>. The first one was diagnosed during the second trimestrer and spontaneous evolution was favorable. The two others were diagnosed in the first trimester with a large and early pericardial<symptom> effusion<symptom> For one , the parents opted for termination of pregnancy at 15 weeks of gestation and the other showed a spontenous regression of the effusion<symptom> and no hemodynamic compromise.
