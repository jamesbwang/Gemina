  Unlike primary myelofibrosis ( PMF) in adults , myelofibrosis in children is rare. Congenital ( inherited) forms of myelofibrosis ( cMF) have been described , but the underlying genetic mechanisms remain elusive. Here we describe 4 families with autosomal recessive inherited macrothrombocytopenia with focal myelofibrosis due to germline loss-of-function mutations in the megakaryocyte-specific immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif ( ITIM)- containing receptor G6b-B ( G6b , C6orf25 or MPIG6B). Patients presented with a mild-to-moderate bleeding diathesis , macrothrombocytopenia , anemia<symptom> , leukocytosis and atypical megakaryocytes associated with a distinctive , focal , perimegakaryocytic pattern of bone<disease> marrow fibrosis<disease>. In addition to identifying the responsible gene , the description of G6b-B as the mutated protein potentially implicates aberrant G6b-B megakaryocytic signaling and activation in the pathogenesis of myelofibrosis. Targeted insertion of human G6b in mice rescued the knockout phenotype and a copy number effect of human G6b-B expression was observed. Homozygous knockin mice expressed 25 % of human G6b-B and exhibited a marginal reduction in platelet count and mild alterations in platelet function; these phenotypes were more severe in heterozygous mice that expressed only 12 % of human G6b-B. This study establishes G6b-B as a critical regulator of platelet homeostasis in humans and mice. In addition , the humanized G6b mouse will provide an invaluable tool for further investigating the physiological functions of human G6b-B as well as testing the efficacy of drugs targeting this receptor.
