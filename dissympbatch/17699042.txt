  To assess the effects of a topical anaesthetic ( TA) and buccal meloxicam ( BM) on behaviour , maximum wound<disease> temperature and wound<disease> morphology following amputation dehorning of beef calves , 50 unweaned Hereford calves were randomly allocated to: ( 1) sham dehorning/ control ( CON , n = 14); ( 2) amputation dehorning ( D , n = 12); ( 3) amputation dehorning with pre-operative buccal meloxicam ( DBM , n = 12); and ( 4) amputation dehorning with post-operative topical anaesthetic ( DTA , n = 12). Videos of the calves were captured for 3 h following treatment. Each calf was later observed for 5 min every hour and the frequency and duration of specific behaviours displayed during these focal periods was recorded. Infrared and digital photographs of dehorning wounds<disease> were collected from all dehorned calves on days 1 , 3 and 7 following treatment. Infrared photographs were used to identify the maximum temperature within the wound<disease> area. Digital photographs were used to score wounds<disease> based on visual signs of inflammation<symptom> and healing , using a numerical rating scale of 1 to 3 , with morphological aspects of inflammation<symptom> increasing and morphological aspects of healing decreasing with progressive scores. CON calves displayed fewer head<symptom> shakes than all dehorned calves at 2 and 3 h following treatment ( P = 0.025). CON and DTA calves displayed less head turns than DBM calves at 2 h following treatment ( P = 0.036). CON calves displayed fewer combined point behaviours than all dehorned calves at 2 h following treatment ( P = 0.037). All dehorning wounds<disease> had a greater maximum temperature on days 3 and 7 compared to day 1 ( P = 0.003). All wound<disease> morphology scores decreased from day 1 to day 3 and wound<disease> morphology scores of DBM and DTA calves increased from day 3 to day 7 ( P = 0.03). Although flystrike may have confounded these observations , no clear effects of TA or BM on behaviour , maximum wound<disease> temperature or wound<disease> morphology following dehorning of calves were observed. Further research is required to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of these products for amputation dehorning of calves.
