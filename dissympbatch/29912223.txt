  Although a new or worsening pericardial<symptom> effusion<symptom> is a diagnostic criterion for pericarditis<disease> , in clinical practice the presence of pericardial<symptom> effusion<symptom> does not necessarily imply the evidence of pericarditis<disease> Up to 40-50 % of cases of pericarditis<disease> do not show the presence of pericardial<symptom> effusion<symptom> ( dry pericarditis<disease> The clinician should first evaluate any related symptoms and signs ( symptomatic vs asymptomatic) , its size and hemodynamic impact , then rule out pericarditis<disease> and the presence of an underlying disease ( e.g. cancer , systemic inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> , renal<symptom> failure<symptom> , hypothyroidism). If no cause is apparent ( `` idiopathic effusion<symptom> '') , the decision to tap should be individualized and based on symptoms. A large , chronic pericardial<symptom> effusion<symptom> may have a good long-term prognosis even without routine drainage.In this paper , we will try to clarify common doubts and outline evidence-based approaches to diagnosis , therapy and follow-up of these patients , also addressing the possible complications and outcomes.
