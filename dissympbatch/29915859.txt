  Subcutaneous<disease> fat necrosis<symptom> of newborn is a form of noninfectious panniculitis. It is an uncommon condition and mostly occurs in full-term infants within first weeks of life that have had a significant condition such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy at the time of birth. Subcutaneous<disease> fat necrosis<symptom> of newborn is usually a self-limiting condition but may be associated with hypercalcemia , which may lead to life threatening levels. Hypercalcemia is a significant reason of subcutaneous fat necrosis<symptom> and needs an intervention involving hyperhydration , calcitonin , diuretics , steroids and sometimes bisphosphonate in resistant cases. Here , we have reported the case of a term infant who developed extensive subcutaneous fat necrosis<symptom> in the first week of life after significant perinatal hypoxic injury. Her condition was complicated by hypercalcemia resistant to prolonged medical treatment with hyperhydration , diuretic and steroid but eventually the infant responded to high doses of calcitonin.
