  Abnormalities in cortical interneurons are closely associated with neurological diseases. Most patients with Foxg1 syndrome<disease> experience seizures<symptom> , suggesting a possible role of Foxg1 in the cortical interneuron development. Here , by conditional deletion of Foxg1 , which was achieved by crossing Foxg1fl/fl with the Gad2-CreER line , we found the postnatal distributions of somatostatin- , calretinin- , and neuropeptide Y-positive interneurons in the cortex were impaired. Further investigations revealed an enhanced dendritic complexity and decreased migration capacity of Foxg1-deficient interneurons , accompanied by remarkable downregulation of Dlx1 and CXCR4. Overexpression of Dlx1 or knock down its downstream Pak3 rescued the differentiation detects , demonstrated that Foxg1 functioned upstream of Dlx1-Pak3 signal pathway to regulate the postnatal development of cortical interneurons. Due to the imbalanced neural circuit , Foxg1 mutants showed increased seizure<symptom> susceptibility. These findings will improve our understanding of the postnatal development of interneurons and help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying seizure<symptom> in patients carrying Foxg1 mutations.
