  Metastasis of breast cancer to mediastinal lymph nodes is common and biopsy of suspicious lesions<symptom> can have important diagnostic , prognostic , and therapeutic implications , particularly with respect to tumor receptor status. Our aim was to show that endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration ( EBUS-TBNA) can be used for the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer and demonstrate reliable receptor evaluation that can result in change of therapy. A retrospective review of consecutive adult patients undergoing EBUS-TBNA from May 2007 to September 2012 was performed. Data collected for patients with a history of breast cancer included patient demographics , tumor pathology , receptor analysis , imaging , and bronchoscopy or surgical results. Sixty-four patients with a history of breast cancer aged from 31 to 81 years underwent EBUS-TBNA for the evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy<disease> of which 16 patients had not been previously treated for their breast cancer with systemic therapy. Eighty suspicious lymph nodes were biopsied measuring 0.8 to 3.1 cm in diameter. Fifty-nine ( 92 %) patients had diagnostic cytology for malignancy or benign lymphoid tissue. Breast malignancy was identified in 33 ( 52 %) patients and 23 ( 70 %) of these had sufficient samples for the evaluation of estrogen , progesterone , and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. Overall 48 % of the patients with receptors analyzed had discordance between the primary tumor and metastasis. EBUS-TBNA is a useful tool for evaluating mediastinal lymphadenopathy<disease> in patients with a history of breast cancer and can provide information on the concordance of receptors status between the primary tumor and metastatic sites in the thorax.
