  Bilateral vestibular weakness<symptom> ( BVW) is a rare cause of imbalance. Patients with BVW complain of oscillopsia. In approximately half of the patients with BVW , the cause remains undetermined; in the remainder , the most common etiology by far is gentamicin ototoxicity , followed by much rarer entities such as autoimmune inner ear disease , meningitis<disease> , bilateral Ménière 's disease , bilateral vestibular neuritis , and bilateral vestibular schwannomas. While a number of bedside tests may raise the suspicion of BVW , the diagnosis should be confirmed by rotatory chair testing. Treatment of BVW is largely supportive. Medications with the unintended effect of vestibular suppression should be avoided.
