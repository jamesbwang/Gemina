  The surgical management of distal intra-articular comminuted fracture of the tibia ( pilon fracture) is difficult because complications frequently develop. The minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis technique is generally accepted for this type of fracture. In this study , complications developed after open reduction and internal fixation using multiple miniplates for accurate reduction of small fracture fragments. Therefore , when we use this technique , we need to pay attention to the development of complications such as nonunion , avascular necrosis<symptom> , and osteomyelitis<disease> by the disruption of both endosteal blood supply by fracture and periosteal blood supply during approach or reduction.
