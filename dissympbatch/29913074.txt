  Megakaryocytes differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone<disease> marrow. The transition of megakaryocytes to platelets is a complex process. Thereby , megakaryocytes extend proplatelets into sinusoidal blood vessels , where the proplatelets undergo fission to release platelets. Defects in platelet production can lead to a low platelet count ( thrombocytopenia<symptom>) with increased bleeding risk. Rho GTPases comprise a family of small signaling G proteins that have been shown to be master regulators of the cytoskeleton controlling many aspects of intracellular processes. The generation of Pf4-Cre transgenic mice was a major breakthrough that enabled studies in megakaryocyte-/ platelet-specific knockout mouse lines and provided new insights into the central regulatory role of Rho GTPases in megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production. In this review , we will summarize major findings on the role of Rho GTPases in megakaryocyte biology with a focus on mouse lines in which knockout strategies have been applied to study the function of the best-characterized members Rac1 , Cdc42 and RhoA and their downstream effector proteins.
