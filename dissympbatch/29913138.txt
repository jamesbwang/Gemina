  It is unknown whether benefits of medical management of urolithiasis outweigh potential side effects of utilized medications including potassium citrate ( Kcit) and thiazide diuretics. Therefore , we sought to evaluate the relationship between Kcit or thiazides and overall stone-related health related quality of life ( HRQOL). Using cross-sectional data from stone forming enrollees in the North American Stone Quality of Life Consortium , we used the Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life questionnaire ( WISQOL) to compare HRQOL between patients treated and not treated with Kcit or thiazide type diuretics. Additionally , the likelihood of gastrointestinal complaints was compared between those prescribed and not prescribed Kcit , and likelihood of fatigue<symptom> and sexual complaints were compared in those prescribed and not prescribed thiazides. Of 1511 subjects ( 787 male , 724 female) , 279 were on Kcit and 238 on thiazides at enrollment. Patients prescribed Kcit had higher HRQOL in each domain vs. those not prescribed Kcit ( p < 0.001). Patients prescribed thiazides had higher HRQOL in each domain compared to those not prescribed a thiazide , all p < 0.01. Those prescribed Kcit were less likely than those not prescribed to report nausea<symptom> , stomach upset or cramps<disease> ( OR 0.57 , p < 0.001). Patients prescribed thiazides were less likely than those not prescribed to report fatigue<symptom> ( OR 0.63 , p = 0.004) or reduced sexual interest/activity ( OR 0.64 , p = 0.005). Among stone-formers , use of Kcit and thiazides is associated with better HRQOL across all WISQOL domains , without increased likelihood of GI complaints and of fatigue<symptom> or sexual complaints , respectively. These findings may be useful when counseling patients regarding initiation of Kcit or thiazides for medical management of nephrolithiasis.
