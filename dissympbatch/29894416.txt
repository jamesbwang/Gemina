  Early prediction of necrotizing pancreatitis<disease> is important for tailoring treatment , but current scoring systems have moderate accuracy and can be calculated only 24 to 48 hours after disease onset. Evaluation of ( micro) circulatory changes in acute pancreatitis<disease> at admission by perfusion computed tomography ( PCT) or angiography could predict necrosis<symptom> earlier. Our aim was to systematically review the evidence for angiographic and PCT prediction of necrotizing pancreatitis<disease> We performed a systematic review and searched MEDLINE and Embase. We included cohort studies addressing pancreatic perfusion for prognostication of severity of acute pancreatitis<disease> and assessed study quality with a tool specific for diagnostic accuracy studies. Six prospective cohorts with 334 patients were included. Sensitivity of PCT for predicting necrosis<symptom> ranged from 71 % to 100 % and specificity from 74 % to 100 %. The only study directly comparing PCT and angiography found a similar sensitivity ( 100 %) but higher specificity for PCT ( 90 % vs 72 %). The included studies had moderate quality. Current studies consistently demonstrate excellent sensitivity and specificity of PCT for early prediction of necrosis<symptom>. The performance found in our review should be confirmed in larger prospective cohorts as published studies have moderate quality. Furthermore , it should be investigated whether early PCT improves disease course.
