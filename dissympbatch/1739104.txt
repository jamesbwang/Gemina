  Fibrillary glomerulonephritis<disease> ( FGN) is an uncommon cause of primary glomerular disease. FGN is usually idiopathic; however , it has been associated with underlying malignancy or autoimmune diseases in some patients as well. The most commonly found autoimmune diseases in FGN patients include Graves ' disease , systemic lupus nephritis , Chron 's disease , and idiopathic thrombocytopenia<symptom> purpura. FGN in a patient with underlying asymptomatic Sjogren 's syndrome<disease> is very rare in the literature , with only two previously reported cases of this association. We present the case of a 75-year-old female with a past medical history of asymptomatic primary Sjogren 's syndrome<disease> and fibromyalgia , who presented to emergency department with a new episode of hypertension. The electron microscopy ( EM) showed randomly arranged nonamyloid fibrillar deposits in the mesangium and glomerular capillary walls , confirming FGN. In this case-based review , we describe in detail the diagnostic work-up , clinical course , and complications in management. We also discuss some of the other nonamyloid fibrillary glomerular diseases.
