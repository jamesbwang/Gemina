  We describe our progress in developing the infrastructure for traceable transient measurements of pressure. Towards that end , we have built and characterized a dual diaphragm shock<symptom> tube that allows us to achieve shock<symptom> amplitude reproducibility of approximately 2.3 % for shocks<disease> with Mach speeds ranging from 1.26 to 1.5. In this proof-of-concept study we use our shock<symptom> tube to characterize the dynamic response of photonic sensors embedded in polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS) , a material of choice for soft tissue phantoms. Our results indicate that the PDMS-embedded photonic sensors response to shock<symptom> evolves over tens to hundreds of microseconds time scale making it a useful system for studying transient pressures in soft tissue.
