  The objective of this study was to assess the effect of the operator 's degree of clinical experience on the residual caries<disease> diagnosis through visual inspection and tactile sensation. The participants were asked about the years of their clinical practice , any further training concerning cariology , their familiarity with the minimal invasive philosophy , and the techniques that they use to remove dental<disease> caries<disease> and detect when to stop the removal of carious tissues. In addition , an Dental students presented statistically significant better sensitivity , than dentists from both age groups , during both visual inspection and tactile sensation of residual caries<disease>. Participants ' ability to diagnose residual caries<disease> during cavity preparation was independent of their years of experience. During the removal of carious lesions<symptom> , with the goal of limiting the sacrifice of healthy structures and the leftover of residual caries<disease> , clinicians should combine a selective removal technique and the attentive visual inspection , with at least one further diagnostic method , aside from the dental explorer. Tactile examination of residual caries<disease> solely with the dental explorer must be used with attention.
