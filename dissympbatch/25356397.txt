  In previous study , we have found intermittent oral levetiracetam ( LEV) can effectively prevent recurrence of febrile seizure<symptom> ( FS). This study aimed to analyze the effects of the preventive on the patients with frequent FS accompanied with epileptiform discharge. Patients with frequent FS were assigned to undergo Electroencephalogram ( EEG). At the onset of fever<disease> , the patients who presented epileptiform discharge were orally administered with LEV with a dose of 15-30 mg/kg per day twice daily for 1 week , thereafter , the dosage was gradually reduced until totally discontinued in the second week. The seizure<symptom> frequency associated with febrile events and FS recurrence rate during a 48-week follow-up were analyzed. among the 19 patients presented epileptiform discharge on EEG , 31.58 % ( 6 of 19) had complex FS , 68.42 % ( 13 of 19) had simple FS. Up to 57.89 % ( 11 of 19) had a family history of seizure<symptom> disorder and 36.84 % ( 7 of 19) had a family history of FS in first-degree relatives. 42.11 % ( 8 of 19) happened the first FS episode at the age < 18 months. 36.84 % ( 7/19) presented generalized spikes , 63.16 % ( 12/19) showed focal spikes. During the 48-week follow-up period , the patients experienced 26 febrile episodes , none of them presented seizure<symptom> recurrence. Intermittent oral LEV can prevent the seizure<symptom> recurrence of FS accompanied with epileptiform discharge in 48-week. However , further randomized controlled trials should be conducted.
