  Skeletal homeostasis is dynamically influenced by the immune system. Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-5 ( LRP5) is a co-receptor of the Wnt signaling pathway , which modulates bone metabolism in humans and mice. Immune disorders can lead to abnormal bone metabolism. It is unclear whether and how LRP5 alters the balance<symptom> of the immune system to modulate bone homeostasis. In this study , we used primary osteoblast to detect the differentiation of osteoblasts in vitro , the immune cells of spleen and bone<disease> marrow of 6-month old LRP5 heterozygote ( HZ) and wild-type ( WT) mice were analyzed by Flow cytometry. We found that LRP5
