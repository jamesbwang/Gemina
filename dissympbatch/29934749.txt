  Lymphoproliferative disorders cause significant morbidity and mortality , either related to the disease itself or therapy complications. Some cases of lymphoma may have vague clinical presentation , especially in the absence of lymphadenopathy<disease> , and a clinical work up may not be conclusive. Our study focuses on autopsy cases of lymphoma patients , emphasizing clinically unsuspected cases. Autopsy records from the last 20 years at our institution were searched , and the clinical parameters were recorded. Fifteen cases of lymphoma were identified , and 5 cases were diagnosed at the time of autopsy. Most B-cell lymphoma cases were mainly nodal disease , while T-cell lymphoma cases had widespread extra-nodal disease. Most deaths in B-cell lymphoma are due to infection/therapy induced immunosuppression , whereas T-cell lymphoma deaths are due to organ infiltration by lymphoma. Postmortem examination may reveal clinically unsuspected lymphoma , especially in rapidly deteriorating patients with vague presentation such as skin<symptom> rash<symptom> , bowel obstruction/bleeding or pacemaker malfunction.
