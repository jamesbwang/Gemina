  Noninvasive ventilation ( NIV) has assumed a central role in the treatment of selected patients with acute<disease> respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> due to exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or acute cardiogenic pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom>. Recent advances in the understanding of physiologic aspects of NIV application through different interfaces and ventilator settings have led to improved patient-machine interaction , enhancing favorable NIV outcome. In recent years , the growing role of NIV in the acute care setting has led to the development of technical innovations to overcome the problems related to gas leakage and dead space , improving the quality of the devices and optimizing ventilation modes.
