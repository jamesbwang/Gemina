  The cornea is unique because of its complete avascularity. Corneal neovascularization ( CNV) can result from a variety of etiologies including contact lens wear; corneal<disease> infections<disease> and ocular surface diseases due to inflammation<symptom> , chemical injury , and limbal stem cell deficiency. Management is focused primarily on the etiology and pathophysiology causing the CNV and involves medical and surgical options. Because inflammation<symptom> is a key factor in the pathophysiology of CNV , corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory medications remain the mainstay of treatment. Anti-VEGF therapies are gaining popularity to prevent CNV in a number of etiologies. Surgical options including vessel occlusion and ocular surface reconstruction are other options depending on etiology and response to medical therapy. Future therapies should provide more effective treatment options for the management of CNV.
