  Benign paroxysmal torticollis<symptom> ( BPT) , benign paroxysmal vertigo<symptom> ( BPV) , and benign tonic upward gaze ( BTU) are characterized by transient and recurrent episodes of neurological manifestations. The purpose of this study was to analyse the clinical relationships between these syndromes<disease> , associated comorbidities , and genetic bases. In this cross-sectional study , clinical data of patients with BPT , BPV , or BTU were collected with a focus on developmental achievements , learning abilities , and rehabilitation. Neuropsychological assessment and genetic testing were performed. Fifty patients ( median age at inclusion 6y) were enrolled. Psychomotor delay , abnormal neurological examination , and low or borderline IQ were found in 19 % , 32 % , and 26 % of the patients respectively. Cognitive dysfunction was present in 27 % of the patients. CACNA1A gene mutation was identified in eight families , and KCNA1 and FGF14 mutation in one family respectively. The identification of a CACNA1A mutation was significantly associated with BTU ( p = 0.03) and with cognitive dysfunction ( p = 0.01). Patients with BPV were less likely to have cognitive dysfunction. Children with BPT , BPV , or BTU are at high risk of impaired psychomotor and cognitive development. These syndromes<disease> should not be regarded as benign and should be considered as part of the spectrum of a neurodevelopmental disorder. Patients with benign paroxysmal torticollis<symptom> ( BPT) , benign paroxysmal vertigo<symptom> ( BPV) , and benign tonic upward gaze ( BTU) have an increased risk of psychomotor delay. These patients also have an increased risk of abnormal neurological examination and cognitive dysfunction. Gene mutations , especially in CACNA1A , were identified in 21 % of the families. BPT , BTU , and BPV should not be regarded as benign. BPT , BTU , and BPV should be considered as part of the spectrum of a neurodevelopmental disorder.
