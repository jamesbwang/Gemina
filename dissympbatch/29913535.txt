  Thrombocytopenia<symptom> is a well-known manifestation of acute tropical infectious<disease> diseases<disease>. The role of platelets in infections has received much attention recently because of their emerging activities in modulation of inflammatory responses , host defense , and vascular integrity. However , while many studies have addressed thrombocytopenia<symptom> in tropical infections , abnormalities in platelet function have been largely overlooked. This is an important research gap , as platelet dysfunction may contribute to the bleeding tendency that characterizes some tropical infections. The development of novel platelet function assays that can be used in thrombocytopenic conditions ( e.g. , flow cytometry assays) has contributed to important new insights in recent years. In this review , the importance of platelets in tropical infections is discussed with special emphasis on the underlying mechanisms and consequences of thrombocytopenia<symptom> and platelet dysfunction in these infections. Special attention is paid to malaria<disease> , a disease characterized by microvascular obstruction in which bleeding is rare , and to infections in which bleeding is common , such as dengue<disease> , other viral hemorrhagic<disease> fevers<disease> , and the bacterial infection leptospirosis<disease> Given the importance of platelet function abnormalities in these infections , the development of affordable assays for monitoring of platelet function in low-resource countries , as well as pharmacologic interventions to prevent or reverse platelet function abnormalities , might improve clinical care and the prognosis of these infections.
