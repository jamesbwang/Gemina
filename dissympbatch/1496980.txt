  The subtelomeric rearrangements are increasingly being investigated in cases of idiopathic intellectual disabilities ( ID) and congenital abnormalities ( CA) but are also thought to be responsible for unexplained recurrent miscarriage ( RM). Such rearrangements can go unnoticed through conventional cytogenetic techniques and are undetectable even with high-resolution molecular cytogenetic techniques such as array comparative genomic hybridization ( aCGH) , especially when DNA of the stillbirth<symptom> or families are not available. The aim of the study is to evaluate the rate of subtelomeric rearrangements in patients with RM. In this cross-sectional study , fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH) , based on ToTelVysion telomeric probes , was undertaken for 21 clinically normal couples exhibiting a `` normal '' karyotype with at least two abortions<disease>. Approximately 62 % had RM with a history of stillbirth<symptom> or CA/ID while the other 38 % had only RM. FISH detected one cryptic rearrangement between chromosomes 3q and 4p in the female partner of a couple ( III: 4) ( 46 , XX , ish t ( 3; 4) ( q28- , p16 +; p16- , q28 +) ( D3S4559 + , D3S4560- , D4S3359 +; D3S4560 + , D4S3359- , D4S2930 +)) who presented a history of RM and family history of ID and CA. Analysis of the other family members of the woman showed that her sisters ( III: 6 and III: 11) and brother ( III: 8) were also carriers of the same subtelomeric translocation t ( 3; 4) ( q28; p16). We conclude that subtelomeric FISH should be undertaken in couples with RM especially those who not only have abortions<disease> but also have had at least one child with ID and/or CA , or other clinically recognizable syndromes<disease>. For balanced and cryptic anomalies , subtelomeric FISH still remains the most suitable and effective tool in characterising such chromosomal rearrangements in RM couples.
