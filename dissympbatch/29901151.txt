  A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that Eph/ephrin signalling may serve a central role in intestinal diseases. However , whether erythropoietin‑producing hepatocellular ( Eph)/ ephrin signalling is associated with the development of post‑infectious irritable bowel syndrome<disease> ( PI‑IBS) is still unknown. In the present study , the role of Eph/Ephrin signalling in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) induced intestinal injury was evaluated in vivo and in vitro. LPS treatment significantly increased the levels of proinflammatory mediators ( monocyte chemoattractant protein‑1 , tumour necrosis<symptom> factor α , interleukin ( IL) 1β , IL‑6 , intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule‑1) , activated the EphA2‑Ephrin A1 , protein kinase B ( Akt) nuclear factor ( NF) κB , Src‑NF‑κB and Wnt/β catenin signalling pathways , and inhibited EphB1‑Ephrin B3 signalling in colon tissues , and primary cultured enteric neuronal and glial cells. Notably , EphA2 monoclonal antibody ( mAb) treatment or Ephrin B3 overexpression could partially alleviate the LPS‑induced upregulation of proinflammatory mediators , and Akt‑NF‑κB , Src‑NF‑κB and Wnt/β catenin signalling pathways. In addition , EphA2 mAb treatment could partially inhibit LPS‑induced inactivation of EphB‑Ephrin B3 signalling , while Ephrin B3 overexpression could abrogate LPS‑induced activation of EphA2‑Ephrin A1 signalling. EphB1/Ephrin B3 signalling may antagonise the EphA2/Ephrin A1‑dependent pathway following LPS treatment. The results associated with the EphA2 signaling pathway , indicated that Eph/ephrin signalling may serve a bidirectional role in LPS‑induced intestinal injury. Eph/ephrin signalling may be a novel therapeutic target for LPS‑induced intestinal injury and potentially PI‑IBS.
