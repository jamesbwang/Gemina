  Uncut Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy ( uRYGJ) was developed to prevent slow peristalsis in the Roux limb after Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy ( RYGJ). This study compared the incidence of Roux stasis syndrome<disease> ( RSS) and severe gastric food stasis in gastric cancer patients who underwent RYGJ or uRYGJ after laparoscopic curative distal gastrectomy. Between January 2006 and June 2012 , 319 patients underwent RYGJ or uRYGJ. After covariates were adjusted by propensity score matching , 39 patients in the RYGJ group and 65 patients in the uRYGJ group were included in the final analysis. RSS was defined as the presence of symptoms , such as nausea<symptom> , vomiting , and abdominal fullness , requiring refasting without ileus or obstruction within 30 days post-surgery. Gastric food stasis was measured endoscopically at 1 and 3 years after gastrectomy. Operative outcomes and morbidities were similar between the two groups , whereas the incidence of RSS was higher in the RYGJ group than in the uRYGJ group , although the difference was not significant ( 7.7 vs. 0 %; odds ratio ( OR) 0.157; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0-1.059 , p = 0.111). Comparison of endoscopic findings revealed that severe gastric stasis 1 year after surgery was significantly less frequent in the uRYGJ group ( 46.2 vs. 13.8 %; OR 0.247; 95 % CI 0.102-0.599 , p = 0.002). The same result was reproduced 3 years after surgery ( 39.4 vs. 15.5 %; OR 0.279; 95 % CI 0.088-0.882 , p = 0.030). Compared with RYGJ , uRYGJ after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy is a safe and effective procedure for preventing severe postoperative gastric food stasis.
