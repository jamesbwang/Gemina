  Many research indicate that the tardive dyskinesia ( TD) is generally linked with long-term antipsychotic therapy for schizophrenia. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF) is a critical role in the protection of catecholaminergic , dopaminergic , and cholinergic neurons. Thus , we examined the serum GDNF levels in schizophrenia patients with TD ( WTD) and without TD ( NTD) and compared with healthy controls ( HC) , respectively. Totally 75 males with schizophrenia were recruited into this study. All were measured by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition , the Positive and Negative Syndrome<disease> Scale , and the Abnormal<symptom> Involuntary<symptom> Movement<symptom> Scale ( AIMS). The patient group was divided into two subgroups: WTD ( n = 32) and NTD ( n = 43) according to the AIMS score. Fifty-three healthy controls matching in age and gender were also enlisted from the region. GDNF levels were examined with sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Analysis of variance indicated significant differences between the three groups ( P = 0.012); GDNF levels in the WTD group were significantly different from those in the NTD ( P = 0.030) and HC ( P = 0.003) groups. Decreased GDNF levels in TD patients indicated that alterations in neurotrophic factors may be involved in the pathophysiology of TD , but the exact mechanisms need further investigation.
