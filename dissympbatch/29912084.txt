  Acute<symptom> pain<symptom> is one of the major complaints reported in pediatric emergency departments and general wards. Recently , both the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicine Agency emitted some warnings regarding the use of opioids , including codeine , in children. The aims of this study were summarizing the main pharmacological aspects of ibuprofen , discussing the current evidence about the use of ibuprofen in different and specific clinical settings , and providing a comparison with acetaminophen and/or codeine , according to available studies. Studies evaluating ibuprofen for the management of acute<symptom> pain<symptom> in children were extracted from the PubMed and MEDLINE database within the period ranging from 1985 through 2017. After discussing safety of ibuprofen and its concomitant use with acetaminophen , the specific indications for the clinical practice were considered. Ibuprofen resulted to be more effective than acetaminophen , and comparable to the combination acetaminophen-codeine , for the control of acute<symptom> pain<symptom> related to musculoskeletal pain. Moreover , similar results have been reported also in the management of toothache and inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> of the oral cavity and pharynx. Ibuprofen resulted to be useful as a first approach to episodic headache<symptom> Finally , the role of ibuprofen in the management of postoperative pain and , particularly , after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy has been reconsidered recently. Ibuprofen resulted to be the most studied nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug in the management of acute<symptom> pain<symptom> in children; in general , it showed a good safety profile and provided evidence of effectiveness , despite some differences according to the specific clinical context.
