  To investigate ethnic differences for moderate-to-severe endometriosis DESIGN: Analysis of a prospective registry , December 2013- December 2016 ( ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT02911090). Women presenting to tertiary referral center for pelvic pain and/or endometriosis. Age greater than 50 , menopausal , or mixed ethnicity. Logistic regression analysis was used to obtain adjusted odds ratios ( aOR) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI) adjusting for potential confounders ( e.g. , age , infertility<symptom> , body-mass-index ( BMI) , previous hormonal use and previous surgery for endometriosis). ( Canadian Task Force Classification II-2). Tertiary referral center PATIENT ( S): A total of 1594 women with pelvic pain and/or endometriosis. None MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Moderate-to-severe endometriosis. On logistic regression , adjusting for potential confounders , East/South East Asians were 8.3 times more likely than Caucasians to have a previous diagnosis of Stage III/IV endometriosis prior to referral ( aOR 8.33 , 95 % CI 3.74-18.57); 2.7 times more likely to have a palpable nodule<disease> ( aOR 2.66 , 95 % CI 1.57-4.52); 4.1 times more likely to have an endometrioma on ultrasound ( aOR 4.10 , 95 % CI 2.68-6.26); and 10.9 times more likely to have Stage III/IV endometriosis at the time of surgery at our center ( aOR 10.87 , 95 % CI 4.34-27.21). Moderate-to-severe endometriosis was more common in women with East or South East Asian ethnicity in our tertiary referral center. This could be explained by East/South East Asians with minimal-mild disease being less likely to seek care , or genetic/environmental differences that increase the risk of more severe disease amongst East/South East Asians.
