  Radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA) in atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) patients can cause various complications and atrioesophageal ( AE) fistula<disease> is one of the most catastrophic complications of RFCA. RFCA registries from 3 cardiovascular centers in the Republic of Korea consisted of 5721 patients undergoing 6724 procedures. Before undergoing RFCA , patients underwent either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. We evaluated clinical , anatomical , and procedural characteristics of patients who developed AE fistula<disease> after RFCA. A total of 10 patients developed AE fistula<disease> after RFCA ( 0.15 % per procedure). All AE fistulas<disease> occurred during first-time RFCA. Eight patients died and mortality rate was 80.0 %. No patients had any gastrointestinal symptom at the time of discharge and mean duration time from RFCA to symptom onset was 23.4 days. Six patients ( 60.0 %) had paroxysmal AF. Substrate modification in addition to pulmonary vein isolation was performed in 4 patients ( 40.0 %). Patients with old age , low body<symptom> weight , and high CHA Posterior wall of LA near left inferior pulmonary vein was the most vulnerable location for AE fistula<disease>. Pulmonary vein isolation was the main lesion<symptom> set associated with AE fistula<disease> and old age , low body<symptom> weight , and high CHA
