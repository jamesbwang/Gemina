  Pulmonary nodular lymphoid hyperplasia<disease> ( PNLH) is a non-neoplastic pulmonary lymphoid disorder that can be mistaken for malignancy on radiography. Herein , we present nine cases of PNLH , emphasizing clinicoradiological findings and histological features. We analyzed radiological and clinicopathological features from the electronic medical records of nine patients ( eight females and one male) diagnosed with PNLH. IgG and IgG4 immunohistochemical staining was performed in three patients. Two of the nine patients had experienced tuberculosis<disease> 40 and 30 years prior , respectively. Interestingly , none were current smokers , although two were ex-smokers. Three patients complaining of persistent cough<symptom> underwent computed tomography of the chest. PNLH was incidentally discovered in five patients during examination for other reasons. The remaining patient was diagnosed with the disease following treatment for pneumonia<disease> Imaging studies revealed consolidation or a mass-like lesion<symptom> in eight patients. First impressions included invasive adenocarcinoma and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue type lymphoma. Aspergillosis was suspected in the remaining patient based on radiological images. Resection was performed in all patients. Microscopically , the lesions<symptom> consisted of nodular proliferation of reactive germinal centers accompanied by infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in various degrees and surrounding fibrosis<disease>. Ultimately , all nine patients were diagnosed with PNLH and showed no evidence of recurrence on follow-up. PNLH is an uncommon but distinct entity with a benign nature , and understanding the radiological and clinicopathological characteristics of PNLH is important.
