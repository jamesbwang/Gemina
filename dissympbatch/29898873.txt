  If the seemingly less invasive semi-flexible pleuroscopes are combined with strategies of conscious sedation and local anesthesia the pleuroscopy has the potential to reach an increasing number of hospital settings. Local experiences can provide valuable information pertaining to the reproducibility of this technique in different scenarios. We performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical records of all patients that had undergone local anesthetic semi-flexible pleuroscopy in our unit between February 2015 and July 2017. Data on demographics , previous biochemical , cytological and histopathological analysis , procedure details , diagnostic and therapeutic results , complications and mortality were collected from all patients. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v23. A total of 30 patients were included. They were mainly male ( 66.7 %) , with a median age of 72 years ( minimum 19 years , maximum 87 years). All presented with exudative pleural effusions<symptom> and the exam was performed for diagnostic reasons. Pleural tissue was obtained in all patients and the overall diagnostic accuracy was 93.3 %. Malignancy was the chief group of diagnosis ( 66.7 %) , followed by pleural tuberculosis<disease> ( 13.3 %). The procedure was well tolerated and self-limited subcutaneous emphysema was the only complication registered ( 13.3 %). No deaths were associated with the procedure. Our results globally overlap those of wider series and reinforce the perception that local anesthetic semi-flexible pleuroscopy is a well-tolerated , safe and highly accurate diagnostic and therapeutic tool which has proved to be both feasible and effective in our experience.
