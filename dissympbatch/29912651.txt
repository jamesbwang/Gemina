  Background Fixed drug eruptions ( FDE) are characterized by recurrent , usually solitary erythematous or dark red macular , plaque or bullous lesions<symptom> , all at the same site. Among the first choices for antidotal treatment in mercury exposure , 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid ( DMPS) is generally a drug with a low incidence of side effects. FDE due to DMPS was not detected in our literature research and so we aimed to present this rare case. Case Report Forty-eight-year-old male patient , gunpowder and explosives factory worker , was admitted to our hospital because of mercury exposure and we started DMPS treatment. On the second day of chelation treatment , swelling and felting on lips and complaints of wound<disease> formation in genital areas started. Annular , purple color plaque on penis with no angioedema was observed. Case was regarded as FDE. Systemic and topical steroid therapy was started after termination of chelation therapy and lesions<symptom> regressed with steroids. Discussion Drug eruptions are substantially common dermatological problems and can be seen in about 2.2 % of inpatients. The most common unexpected effects of DMPS are allergic skin reactions. The clinical state regress rapidly after the cessation of chelation therapy.
