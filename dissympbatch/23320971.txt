  Staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis<disease> ( SAGN) is a rare immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis<disease> associated with active We report the case of a 64-year-old man with alcohol-associated cirrhosis , type 2 diabetes mellitus , and hypertension who presented to hospital with lower back and abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , rectal bleeding , a purpuric lower extremity rash<symptom> , and oliguric acute kidney injury with microscopic hematuria<symptom> and nephrotic-range proteinuria<symptom>. Skin biopsy revealed IgA leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Serum cryoglobulins were positive and there was hypocomplementemia with a low C3 level. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine revealed septic discitis and epidural abscesses<disease> caused by a recent Urgent hemodialysis was initiated along with a prolonged course of intravenous cefazolin. Remarkably , the patient demonstrated a complete recovery of renal function after 2 months of dialysis dependence and successful treatment of the epidural abscesses<disease> This case shows that SAGN can closely mimic the clinical , laboratory , and histological presentation of Henoch-Sch√∂nlein Purpura or cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. Clinical history and kidney biopsy , particularly electron microscopic analysis , are essential to establishing the correct diagnosis to avoid the unnecessary and potentially harmful administration of immunosuppression. Despite the typically poor prognosis of SAGN , this case report illustrates that full renal recovery remains possible with supportive care and eradication of the underlying infection.
