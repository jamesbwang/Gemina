  We present a case of a 76 year-old , non-smoking Honduran female who was referred to our clinic for years of persistent dry<symptom> cough<symptom>. Cardiac evaluation was unremarkable. She denied symptoms of heartburn , allergic rhinitis , and there was no personal or family history of asthma. Her physical exam demonstrated wheezing over the right mid-posterior chest. Spirometry was within normal limits. CT-imaging of the chest demonstrated right middle lobe bronchus and lingular segmental bronchus narrowing with bibasilar atelectasis and mild interlobular septal thickening with prominent mediastinal adenopathy<symptom>. Bronchoscopy showed diffuse airway hyperpigmentation , right middle lobe medial segmental bronchial stenosis and lingular segmental bronchial stenosis. Endobronchial ultrasound demonstrated enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes , and transbronchial needle aspirates revealed necrotic tissue with black anthracotic pigment. Cultures were negative. Post-procedurally , the patient revealed regular use of a wood stove in an enclosed , poorly-ventilated kitchen. Anthracosis is the black discoloration of bronchial mucosa due to deposition of carbon-based particles in the airway , usually related to chronic environmental exposures. It can eventually result in endobronchial and parenchymal fibrosis<disease> and is mostly seen in non-smokers. Burning biomass fuel from wood smoke is a risk factor in the developing world. Symptoms include cough<symptom> , dyspnea<symptom> , and wheezing. Spirometry will usually demonstrate obstruction. CT-based imaging can show intraluminal narrowing , predominantly affecting the right middle and right upper lobe bronchi , resulting in distal segmental collapse. Extrapulmonary findings are rare , but usually are in the form of calcified mediastinal adenopathy<symptom> on CT-based imaging , which allows for differentiation from lung cancer. There is no reliable treatment though bronchodilators can achieve clinical benefit.
