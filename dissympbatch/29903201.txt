  To discuss the risk factors of the gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM) among the re-birth pregnant women. A total of 393 pregnant women with GDM were collected randomly according to the number of the antenatal care manual in the Maternal and Child Health Hospital in Xiamen City. Meanwhile , 393 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance were chosen to be the control group matching withage of the GDM group. Their basic data would be analyzed , including the BMI before pregnancy , the degree of the education , the times of the abortion<disease> , the body<symptom> weight gain during the pregnancy , their parental diabetes history , the birth weight of the last fetal , the history of GDM and so on. The two groups of people were re-birth pregnant women. Single factor analysis showed that among the GDM group , the total body<symptom> weight gain before the 24 th week ( 9. 11 ± 3. 09) kg and the proportion of their mothers with the DM ( 64/393) were both higher than the control group ( 7. 54 ± 2. 95) kg and ( 38/393) , however , the degree of the education was lower than the control group. Paired chi-square analysis showed that the history of macrosomia delivery ( χ ~ 2 = 14. 297 , P = 0. 001) , the history of GDM ( χ ~ 2 = 12. 938 , P = 0. 001) , and abortion<disease> history more than 2 times ( χ ~ 2 = 7. 078 , P = 0. 010) were the risk factors of GDM for those women. Meanwhile , with the increasing of the fetal birth weight , the risk of being the GDM during the second pregnancy was also increasing. When the fetal birth weight reached 3. 8 kg , OR = 3. 467 , the risk value reached a strong correlation. Multiple factors Logistic regression analysis showed those factors of GDM also had statistically significant differences , especially the bodyweight gain before the 24 th week over 10 kg played the most important role during the pregnancy ( OR = 1. 875 , P = 0. 001). The risk factors of the GDM for the re-birth pregnant women concluded the history of GDM , the history of macrosomia , the times of the abortion<disease> over twice , the bodyweight gain before the 24 th week over 10 kg , the low degree of the education , the pregnant women 's mother had the DM. For those pregnant women with fetal birth weight above 3. 8 kg , they should be included in the high risk population of GDM during the next pregnancy.
