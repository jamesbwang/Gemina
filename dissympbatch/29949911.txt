  Lipid assemblies in the form of two dimensional films have been used extensively as biosensing platforms. These films exhibit certain similarities with cell membranes<symptom> , thus providing a suitable means for the immobilization of proteinaceous moieties and , further , a number of intrinsic signal amplification mechanisms. Their implementation in the detection of toxins yielded reliable and fast detectors for in field analyses of environmental and clinical samples. Some examples are presented herein , including aflatoxin and cholera<disease> toxin detection. The conditions and parameters that determine the analytical specifications of the lipid membrane sensors are discussed , advantages and technology bottlenecks are reviewed , and possible further developments are highlighted.
