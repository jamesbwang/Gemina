  Rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) is a systemic autoimmune condition characterized by erosive inflammation<symptom> of the joints. One rare pulmonary manifestation is obliterative bronchiolitis<disease> ( OB) , a small airways disease characterized by the destruction of bronchiolar epithelium and airflow obstruction. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of patients with rheumatoid arthritis-associated obliterative bronchiolitis<disease> ( RA-OB) from 01/01/2000 to 12/31/2015. Presenting clinical features , longitudinal pulmonary function testing , radiologic findings , and independent predictors of all-cause mortality were assessed. Forty one patients fulfilled criteria for diagnosis of RA-OB. There was notable female predominance ( 92.7 %) with a mean age of 57 Â± 15 years. Dyspnea<symptom> was the most common presenting clinical symptom. Median FEV1 was 40 % ( IQR 31-52.5) at presentation , with a mean decline of- 1.5 % over a follow-up period of thirty-three months. Associated radiologic findings included mosaic attenuation and pulmonary nodules<symptom>. A majority of patients ( 78 %) received directed therapy including long-acting inhalers , systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents , and macrolide antibiotics. All-cause mortality was 27 % over a median follow-up of sixty-two months ( IQR 32-113). No distinguishable predictors of survival at presentation were found. RA-OB appears to have a stable clinical course in the majority of patients despite persistent symptoms and severe obstruction based on presenting FEV1.
