  Rett syndrome<disease> is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting the nervous , musculoskeletal and gastroenteric systems. Affected individuals show normal neonatal development for 6-18 months followed by sudden growth arrest , psychomotor retardation and a broad spectrum of clinical features. Sequence variants in MECP2 gene have been identified as the major genetic etiology accounting for 90-95 % of patients. Apart from MECP2 , pathogenic sequence variants and copy number variants of FOXG1 gene lead to congenital type of Rett syndrome<disease> which is a more severe form and characterised by absence of early normal development as seen in classical Rett syndrome<disease>. In this report we describe a female child with global developmental delay , microcephaly and myoclonic seizures<symptom> harbouring a 5 Mb deletion in 14q12 locus resulting in deletion of single copy of brain specific genes FOXG1 , PRKD1 and NOVA1. Whole exome sequencing ruled out any possible role of other pathogenic single nucleotide variants and/or indels as the etiology for the observed phenotype. However , copy number variation analysis from the whole exome data detected a ~ 5 Mb microdeletion at the long arm of chromosome 14q12 region. The deletion was confirmed through array Comparative Genomic Hybridization and validated by quantitative PCR. Further , parents were analysed for mosaicism through metaphase Fluorescence in-situ Hybridisation. Our report broadens the phenotype of atypical Rett syndrome<disease> and reiterates the role of exome sequencing not only in detection of point mutation/small indels but also for detection of large deletions/duplication in coding regions.
