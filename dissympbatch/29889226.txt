  Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) patients may be at risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) due to chronic inflammation<symptom> , hepatotoxic drugs , and alteration of the gut microbiota. Prospective data using accurate diagnostic methods are lacking. We prospectively investigated prevalence and predictors of NAFLD and liver fibrosis<disease> by transient elastography ( TE) with associated controlled attenuation parameter ( CAP) in IBD patients as part of a routine screening program. NAFLD was defined as CAP ≥ 248 dB/m. Significant liver fibrosis<disease> ( stage 2 or higher out of 4) was defined as TE measurement ≥ 7.0 kPa. Predictors of NAFLD and significant liver fibrosis<disease> were determined by logistic regression analysis. A total of 384 patients ( mean age 42.4 years , 45.0 % male , 64.6 % with Crohn 's disease) with no significant alcohol intake were included. Prevalence of NAFLD and significant liver fibrosis<disease> was 32.8 % and 12.2 % , respectively. Independent predictors of NAFLD were older age ( adjusted odds ratio ( aOR) , 1.45; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.15-1.82) , higher body mass index ( BMI; aOR , 1.31; 95 % CI , 1.20-1.42) and higher triglycerides ( aOR , 1.45; 95 % CI , 1.01-2.09). Significant liver fibrosis<disease> was independently predicted by older age ( aOR , 1.38; 95 % CI , 1.12-1.64) and higher BMI ( aOR , 1.14; 95 % CI , 1.07-1.23). Extrahepatic diseases were more common in IBD patients with NAFLD compared with those without , namely chronic kidney disease ( 10.3 vs 2.3 %; P < 0.001) and cardiovascular diseases ( 11.3 vs 4.7 %; P = 0.02). NAFLD diagnosed by TE with CAP is a frequent comorbidity in IBD patients and is associated with extrahepatic diseases. Noninvasive screening strategies could help early diagnosis and initiation of interventions , including weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , correction of dyslipidemia , and linkage to care. 10.1093/ ibd/izy200 _ video1izy200.video15794817619001.
