  Pseudoaneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery ( SMA) is rare and associated with the risk of massive fatal hemorrhage<symptom> and acute mesenteric ischemia. We describe a 43-year-old man with acute pancreatitis<disease> who presented with an SMA pseudoaneurysm measuring 13 Ã— 12 cm in diameter. The pseudoaneurysm originated between the first and second jejunal arteries and drained into the mesenteric vein. The SMA trunk between the first and second jejunal arteries was embolized with detachable coils using microballoon assistance. After coil placement , arteriography showed the collateral circulation and no perfusion delay of the distal SMA. This technique was useful for isolation of the SMA pseudoaneurysm.
