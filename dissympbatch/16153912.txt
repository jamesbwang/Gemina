  Resistance exercise may lead to an aneurysm<disease> due to dangerous levels of systemic hypertension. Thus , a minimized pressure response during exercise may guarantee safer training. For that , we analyzed an interrepetition rest design ( IRD) hypothesizing that it would produce a lower systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) response in comparison with a continuous design ( CD). Additionally , we studied the effect of accumulated repetitions on the increasing SBP rate during the first continuous set. Fifteen healthy participants ( age: 24 ± 2 years; SBP: 113 ± 8 mmHg) performed leg presses , with 40 repetitions and 720 s of total rest , structured in an IRD of individual repetitions ( resting time: 18.5 s) , and in a CD of five sets of eight repetitions ( resting time: 180 s). Analyses reported an increase (
