  A 62-year-old male presented to his treating cardiologist for routine interrogation of his implantable cardiac defibrillator on the background of severe ischemic cardiomyopathy and end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis. The device log revealed multiple paroxysms of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>; however , upon scrutinizing these episodes it was evident that they always corresponded to episodes of hemodialysis while dialyzing through a chronic dialysis catheter , but not while dialyzing via an arteriovenous fistula<disease>. We report the novel finding of inappropriate sensing of current leak from the catheter by a lead with a floating atrial dipole.
