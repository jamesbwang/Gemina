  Chronic<disease> diseases<disease> account for the majority of deaths in Brazil. These include hypertension ( SAH) and diabetes mellitus ( DM) , which are the main causes of chronic kidney disease ( CKD). This study aimed to validate the data of an electronic health record and to point out characteristics of the profile of these users in relation to clinical quality indicators for a pre-dialytic CKD. Retrospective cohort , August/2010 to December/2014. Included users > 18 years , with at least two queries. Variables analyzed: sociodemographic , underlying disease , main medications and main clinical indicators of control. A descriptive analysis was performed and the percentage of users was evaluated in the goals at admission and at the end of the study. Exported , converted and validated data of 1,977 users with average follow-up time of 21 months. Of these , 51.4 % were men , 58 % were > 64 years of age and 81.6 % were overweight. The main medications in use were diuretics ( 82.9 %) , BRAT ( 62 %) , Statin ( 60.7 %) and ACE inhibitors ( 49.9 %). The percentage of users with a decline in the glomerular filtration rate was 33.7 %. Regarding glycated hemoglobin , users with CKD and DM , 36 % were within the initial goal and 52.1 % of the final. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> was at the target for admission at 34.3 % and 49.8 % at the end of follow-up. Validated data are of vital importance for health managers to monitor users. The population of this study is predominantly elderly , obese , requiring multi-professional care to slow the progression of the disease and decrease morbidity and mortality.
