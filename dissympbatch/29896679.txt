  Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer ( EBVaGC) is a representative EBV-infected epithelial neoplasm , which is now included as one of the four subtypes of The Cancer Genome Atlas molecular classification of gastric cancer. In this review , we portray a gastritis-infection-cancer sequence of EBVaGC. This virus-associated type of gastric cancer demonstrates clonal growth of EBV-infected epithelial cells within the mucosa of atrophic gastritis<disease> Its core molecular abnormality is the EBV-specific hyper-epigenotype of CpG island<disease> promoter methylation , which induces silencing of tumor suppressor genes. This is due to the infection-induced disruption of the balance<symptom> between DNA methylation and DNA demethylation activities. Abnormalities in the host cell genome , including phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit Î± ( PIK3CA) , AT-rich interaction domain 1A ( ARID1A) , and programmed death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1) , are associated with the development and progression of EBVaGC. Furthermore , posttranscriptional modulation affects the transformation processes of EBV-infected cells , such as epithelial mesenchymal transition and anti-apoptosis , via cellular and viral microRNAs ( miRNAs). Once established , cancer cells of EBVaGC remodel their microenvironment , at least partly , via the delivery of exosomes containing cellular and viral miRNAs. After exosomes are incorporated , these molecules change the functions of stromal cells , tuning the microenvironment for EBVaGC. During this series of events , EBV hijacks and uses cellular machineries , such as DNA methylation and the miRNA delivery system. This portrait of gastritis-infection-cancer sequences highlights the survival strategies of EBV in the stomach epithelial cells and may be useful for the integration of therapeutic modalities against EBV-driven gastric cancer.
