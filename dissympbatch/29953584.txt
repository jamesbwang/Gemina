  This article reviews the profile of perampanel , a novel noncompetitive α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate ( AMPA) receptor antagonist , and its role as a potential broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug in the treatment of epilepsy. For this narrative review , data were collected using specified search criteria. Articles reporting the evidence for perampanel 's efficacy from preclinical models , phase 3 clinical studies , observational studies , and descriptive evidence were included. AMPA receptors play a key role in mediating the action of glutamate at the excitatory synapse. Preclinical research showed the AMPA receptor blockade to constitute a promising target for antiepileptic drug therapy. In animal models , perampanel proved to be protective against seizures<symptom> and reduce seizure<symptom> severity and duration. Four phase-3 randomized controlled trials ( 3 in patients with focal seizures<symptom> and one in primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures<symptom> in idiopathic generalized epilepsy) have been completed. In focal ( partial) onset seizures<symptom> , perampanel ( 4 , 8 , and 12 mg) significantly reduced seizure<symptom> frequency per 28 days ( 23.3 % -28.8 % vs 12.8 %; P < .01) and responder rates ( ≥ 50 % reduction in seizures<symptom>) ( 28.5 % -35.3 % vs 19.3 %; P < .05) compared with placebo. In primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures<symptom> , perampanel 8 mg resulted in greater reduction in seizure<symptom> frequency per 28 days ( -76.5 % vs -38.4 %; P < .0001) and responder rate ( 64.2 % vs 39.5 %; P = .0019) than placebo. The efficacy , safety , and tolerability of perampanel have been reproduced in real-world clinical practice , and the agent has been shown to be effective in other epilepsy syndromes<disease>. Perampanel is a potentially broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug with a novel mechanism of action that may be a useful addition for patients with epilepsy with various seizure<symptom> types. The availability of novel antiepileptic drugs for epilepsy treatment enables more individualized treatment for these patients.
