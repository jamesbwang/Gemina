  Data from exome sequencing show that a proportion of individuals in whom a genetic disorder is suspected turn out to have not one , but two to four distinct ones. This may require an evolution in our diagnostic attitude towards individuals with complex disorders. We report a patient with splenomegaly<symptom> , pneumopathy , bone changes and fronto-temporal dementia ( FTD). `` Sea-blue histiocytes '' in his bone<disease> marrow pointed to a lysosomal storage disease. Homozygosity for a pathogenic mutation in the SMPD1 gene confirmed Niemann-Pick disease type B ( NPD-B). Mild cognitive impairment and abnormal brain FDG PET were consistent with FTD. We initially tried to fit the skeletal and neurologic phenotype into the NPD-B diagnosis. However , additional studies revealed a pathogenic mutation in the SQSTM1 gene. Thus , our patient had two distinct diseases; NPD-B , and Paget 's disease of bone with FTD. The subsequent finding of a mutation in SQSTM1 gene ended our struggle to explain the combination of findings by a singular `` unifying '' diagnosis and allowed us to make specific therapeutic decisions. SQSTM1 mutations have been reported in association with FTD , possibly because of defective autophagy. Bisphosphonates may be beneficial for PDB , but since they are known to inhibit acid sphingomyelinase activity , we refrained from using them in this patient. While the principle of looking for unifying diagnosis remains valid , physicians should consider the possibility of co-existing multiple diagnoses when clinical features are difficult to explain by a single one. Accurate diagnostic work-up can guide genetic counseling but also lead to better medical management.
