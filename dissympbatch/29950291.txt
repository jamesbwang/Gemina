  Bone<disease> marrow megakaryocytes ( MKs) produce platelets by extending proplatelets into sinusoidal blood vessels. Defects in thrombopoiesis can lead to thrombocytopenia<symptom> associated with increased bleeding tendency. Recently , the platelet disorder congenital autosomal recessive small-platelet thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( CARST) was described which is caused by mutations in the ADAP ( Adhesion and degranulation promoting adaptor protein; synonym: FYB , SLAP130/120) gene , and characterized by microthrombocytopenia and bleeding symptoms. In this study we used constitutive ADAP-deficient mice ( Adap
