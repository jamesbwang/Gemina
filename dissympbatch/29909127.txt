  Burnout and mental disorders have been reported in the financial industry. This study aims to examine the structural validity of the Maslach Burnout Inventory ( MBI) and to investigate the connection between the dimensions of burnout and depressive symptoms in a sample of 1046 bank employees from North Brazil who completed the MBI and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ( PHQ-9. Exploratory factor analysis ( EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA) were used to cross-check the factorial structure of the MBI. One-way analysis of variance and correlation analysis were applied to elucidate the relationship between burnout and depressive symptoms. Both 3-factor and 4-factor oblique solutions were plausible EFA models of the burnout syndrome<disease>. Results of CFA supported the 19-item 4-factor structure as the best fitting model to data , with two exhaustion<symptom> factors ( `` exhausted '' and `` strained '') , depersonalization , and personal accomplishment. The PHQ-9 total score and individual score of depressive items were significantly correlated with all MBI dimensions , notably with the emotional exhaustion<symptom> dimension. The moderate-to-high correlation observed between burnout and depression<symptom> suggest the potential utility of the MBI for evaluating burnout among bank employees as well as to point out the need to evaluate systematically the burnout and depressive symptoms given to their potential association.
