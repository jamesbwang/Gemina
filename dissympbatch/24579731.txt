  Cancer immunoprevention is based on the fact that a functioning immune system controls tumor onset and development in humans and animals , thus leading to the idea that the enhancement of immune responses in healthy individuals could effectively reduce cancer risk later in life. Successful primary immunoprevention of tumors caused by hepatitis<disease> B<disease> and papilloma viruses is already implemented at the population level with specific vaccines. The immunoprevention of human tumors unrelated to infectious<disease> agents<disease> is an outstanding challenge. Proof-of-principle preclinical studies in genetically-modified or in carcinogen-exposed mice clearly demonstrated that vaccines and other immunological treatments induce host immune responses that effectively control tumor onset and progression , eventually resulting in cancer prevention. While a straightforward translation to healthy humans is currently unfeasible , a number of pioneering clinical trials showed that cancer immunoprevention can be effectively implemented in human cohorts affected by specific cancer risks , such as preneoplastic/early neoplastic lesions<symptom>. Future developments will see the implementation of cancer immunoprevention in a wider range of conditions at risk of tumor development , such as the exposure to known carcinogens and genetic predispositions.
