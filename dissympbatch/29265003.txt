  Chronic kidney disease ( CKD) is recognized as a worldwide epidemic. Hypertension commonly coexists with CKD and its prevalence is progressively increasing as kidney function declines. For patients with established CKD and/or diabetes with albuminuria , the updated hypertension guidelines have recommended a blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) goal < 130/80 mmHg. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> level above 130/80 mmHg in CKD patients requires lifestyle modifications and multiple antihypertensive medications. According to recent guidelines , angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE) inhibitors should be the drugs of first choice. Angiotensin II receptor blockers ( ARBs) should be used if the ACE inhibitor is not tolerated. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs consistently reduce albuminuria and slow the decline in kidney function. Dihydropyridine CCBs should not be used as monotherapy in proteinuric CKD patients but always in combination with a RAAS blocker. Diuretics are commonly used and represent the cornerstone in the management of CKD patients. All the other agents are used when treatment with the other primary<disease> agents<disease> have failed. In patients with CKD , an intensive BP goal < 130/80 mmHg has been recommended. We review current treatment options.
