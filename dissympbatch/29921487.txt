  As silver dressings gain more widespread use , it is more likely that patients with silver-based dressings will also undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). In current practice , these dressings are removed prior to imaging due to concerns over heating and image distortion. As dressing changes can be painful , the need to remove dressings simply for MRI may increase pain and contribute to opioid dependency. To examine the need for dressing removal , American Society for Testing and Materials International standards for assessing device deflection and torque were performed on 5 silver containing and 3 non-silver control dressings. Magnetically induced heating and image distortion were examined in a porcine hind<symptom> limb wound<disease> dressed with control and test dressings. The limb was scanned in a clinical high field 3T MRI scanner using a series of standard MRI sequences ( Survey , T
