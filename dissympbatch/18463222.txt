  Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis ( IPA) has been increasingly reported in patients with underlying respiratory<disease> diseases<disease> ( URD). Early diagnosis of IPA is crucial for mortality reduction and improved prognosis , yet remains difficult. Existing diagnostic tools for IPA largely rely on the detection of biomarkers based on serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF) , both of which have their limitations. The use of sputum<symptom> sample is non-invasive , and Aspergillus detection is feasible; however , the usefulness of sputum<symptom> biomarkers for the diagnosis of IPA , especially in patients with URD , has not been systematically studied. This is a prospective diagnostic trial. At least 118 participants will be recruited from respiratory wards and intensive care units. IPA is defined according to the EORTC/MSG criteria modified for patients with URD. Induced sputum<symptom> and blood will be collected , and BALF will be obtained by bronchoscopy. Sputum<symptom> biomarkers , including galactomannan , Aspergillus DNA , triacetylfusarinine and bis ( methylthio) gliotoxin will be determined , and the presence of a JF5 antigen will be examined with a lateral fluid device. The sensitivity , specificity , negative predictive value , positive predictive value and diagnostic odds ratio will be computed for different biomarkers and compared using the McNemar Ï‡ We have developed and verified the feasibility of Aspergillus-related biomarker assays for sputum<symptom>. The study findings will contribute to a novel look at the diagnostic performance of sputum<symptom> biomarkers in IPA and provide important insight into the improvement of the early diagnosis of IPA , particularly in patients with URD. This study has been registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( ChiCTR-DPD-16009070) on 24th of August 2016.
