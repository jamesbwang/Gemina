  The cumulative surgery rate and postoperative relapse of intestinal Behçet 's disease ( BD) have been reported to be high. This study aimed to establish a scoring system based on follow-up endoscopic findings that can predict intestinal BD recurrence after surgery. Fifty-four patients with intestinal BD who underwent surgery due to bowel complications and underwent follow-up colonoscopy were retrospectively investigated. Their clinical data , including colonoscopic findings , were retrieved. Classification A regression tree analysis was used to develop an appropriate endoscopic classification model that can explain the postsurgical recurrence of intestinal BD most accurately based on the following classification: e,0-no lesions<symptom>; e,1-solitary ulcer<disease> ＜ 20 mm in size; e,2-solitary ulcer<disease> ≥ 20 mm in size; and e,3-multiple ulcers<disease> regardless of size. Clinical relapse occurred in 37 patients ( 61.5 %). Among 38 patients with colonoscopic recurrence , only 29 patients had clinically relapsed. In multivariate analysis , higher disease activity index for intestinal BD at colonoscopy ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 1.013; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.005 to 1.021; p = 0.002) and colonoscopic recurrence ( HR , 2.829; 95 % CI , 1.223 to 6.545; p = 0.015) were identified as independent risk factors for clinical relapse of intestinal BD. The endoscopic score was also an independent risk factor of clinical relapse ( p = 0.012). The risk of clinical relapse was higher in the e ,3 group compared to the e ,0 group ( HR , 6.284; 95 % CI , 2.036 to 19.391; p = 0.001). This new endoscopic scoring system could predict clinical relapse in patients after surgical resection of intestinal BD.
