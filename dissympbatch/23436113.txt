  Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis<disease> ( PLE) is a rare disorder of the nervous system associated with malignant disease. It has a subacute onset with the following symptoms: cognitive dysfunction , seizures<symptom> , irritability<symptom> , hallucinations , and short-term memory<symptom> loss<symptom>. Herein , we report the case of a 35-year-old man with PLE , an olfactory neuroblastoma ( ONB) admixed with craniopharyngioma , and serum anti-Hu antibodies. The patient presented with generalized seizures<symptom> , short-term memory<symptom> loss<symptom> , and a polypoid mass located high in the nasal cavity. He underwent surgical resection of the tumor and postoperative chemoradiotherapy with concurrent intra-arterial cisplatin administration. Pathological examination indicated an ONB admixed with craniopharyngioma. The patient 's neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom> gradually diminished after surgery. No evidence of recurrence was observed during a 4-year follow-up. We reported a histologically unusual heterogeneous tumor that comprised ONB and craniopharyngioma. This is the first reported case of PLE with anti-Hu antibodies possibly associated with ONB admixed with craniopharyngioma.
