  Hepcidin is a central regulator of iron homeostasis. Its production is also influenced by systemic inflammation<symptom>. The aims of this study were to compare hepcidin levels in paediatric patients newly diagnosed with Crohn 's disease ( CD) and ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) and to determine the association of hepcidin levels with laboratory and clinical parameters of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) activity. Children with newly diagnosed IBD between January 2012 and September 2016 were enrolled in this comparative cross-sectional study. We analysed levels of serum hepcidin , C-reactive protein , iron , ferritin , soluble transferrin receptors , blood count and faecal calprotectin in all subjects. Serum hepcidin levels were measured by reverse-phase liquid chromatography. The Paediatric Crohn 's Disease Activity Index was used to evaluate CD in children , and Paediatric Ulcerative<disease> Colitis<disease> Activity Index was used for the assessment of UC disease activity. Subjects with CD ( n = 53) had significantly higher serum hepcidin levels compared with subjects with UC ( n = 23)- 22.6 ng/mL ( range 8.5-65.0) versus 6.5 ng/mL ( range 2.4-25.8) ( P < 0.05). Hepcidin was independently associated with ferritin levels in all IBD patients ( P < 0.05). Moreover , there was a significant positive correlation between hepcidin and platelet count ( P < 0.05) in children with CD and a negative correlation between hepcidin and faecal calprotectin ( P < 0.05) in children with UC. Different hepcidin levels between children with newly diagnosed CD and UC suggest the distinct contribution of iron deficiency and/or systemic inflammation<symptom> to anaemia and may help clinicians choose the best anti-anaemic treatment.
