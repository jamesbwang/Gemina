  Previous studies evaluating the clinical benefits of prophylactic antibiotics for severe acute pancreatitis<disease> ( SAP) have generated inconsistent results due to heterogeneities among the study settings. We determined if early prophylactic antibiotics improved the outcomes of SAP patients using a study designed to overcome these previous methodological weaknesses<symptom>. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of SAP patients discharged between July 2010 and March 2016 , using a Japanese nationwide inpatient database. We divided patients into those with early prophylactic carbapenem use ( prophylaxis group) and those without prophylaxis ( control group). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and the secondary outcomes included oral vancomycin use and others. We identified a total of 3354 eligible patients , including 2493 in the prophylaxis group and 861 in the control group. The overall in-hospital mortality was 12.8 %. Prophylactic antibiotics were not significantly associated reduced in-hospital mortality according to Cox regression analysis ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 0.88; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.62-1.23) or instrumental variable analysis ( risk difference , -1.2 %; 95 % CI , -9.8 % -7.4 %). However , prophylactic antibiotic use was significantly associated with oral vancomycin use during hospitalization in a competing-risk model ( subdistribution HR , 1.91; 95 % CI , 1.02-3.56). The present study suggests that routine early prophylactic antibiotic use have no significant clinical benefit in SAP patients but may increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections.
