  A growing bulk of evidence suggests that cholesterol oxidation products , known as oxysterols , are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of major chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , including atherosclerosis , Alzheimer 's disease , and inflammatory bowel disease. Oxysterols are involved in various key steps of these complex processes , mainly thanks to their ability to act through up-regulation of oxidative stress , inflammation<symptom> , and cell toxicity. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the effects induced by these compounds on cells , after their accumulation in the arterial wall , brain , and intestine. This evidence might help to develop innovative strategies to counteract the progression of these chronic inflammatory
