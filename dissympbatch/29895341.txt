  To analyse the clinical outcomes of biodegradable synthetic polyurethane foam versus ribbon gauze and ear wick in the treatment of severe acute otitis<disease> externa. Ninety-two adults with severe acute otitis<disease> externa were randomly assigned to groups receiving ear wick ( n = 28) , ribbon gauze ( n = 34) or biodegradable synthetic polyurethane foam ( n = 30). Clinical efficacy , in terms of otalgia , oedema , erythema and tenderness<symptom> of the external auditory canal , was assessed before packing was applied and at follow up on the 3rd and 7th days of presentation. All packing materials were associated with improved otalgia and oedema on the 3rd day; however , there were significant differences between biodegradable synthetic polyurethane foam and the other packing materials , and there was no significant reduction in tenderness<symptom> in the biodegradable synthetic polyurethane foam group on the 3rd day. In the ribbon gauze and ear wick groups , improvements in all clinical efficacy scores were statistically significant for all pairwise comparisons. The three packing materials were all quite effective in treating severe acute otitis<disease> externa , but ear wick and ribbon gauze were superior to biodegradable synthetic polyurethane foam for relieving signs and symptoms , especially on the 3rd day.
