  Dermatology was consulted in the care of a 58-year-old man with a history of paranoid schizophrenia , neuroleptic malignant syndrome<disease> , a positive purified protein derivative test , and a lack of bathing for approximately 4 years who had been admitted to the hospital because of thick , crusted lesions<symptom> over an increasing portion of his body. Admitted involuntarily , he was disinterested in the history , physical examination , and diagnostic testing. Comorbid schizophrenia presented a unique challenge because he was unable to participate in his care effectively. His story was told through caregivers. Although mostly compliant , the patient was reserved and indifferent , and had little to add even with direct questions.
