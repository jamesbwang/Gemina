  Our aim was to evaluate whether chronic administration of CAF affects the uterus and induces the morphological and molecular changes associated with endometrial hyperplasia<disease>. Female Wistar rats exposed to CAF from weaning for 20 weeks displayed increased energy intake , body<symptom> weight and fat depots , but did not develop metabolic syndrome<disease>. The adult uteri showed an increase in glandular volume fraction and stromal area. The epithelial proliferation rate and protein expression of oestrogen receptor alpha ( ERÎ±) were also increased. The CAF diet enhanced leptin serum levels and the long form of leptin receptor ( Ob-Rb) mRNA expression in the uterus. No changes were detected in either insulin serum levels or those of insulin growth factor I ( IGF-I) mRNA expression. However the levels of IGF-I receptor ( IGF-IR) mRNA were lower in CAF-fed animals. Overall , the results indicate that our rat model of the CAF diet produces morphological and molecular changes associated with uterine hyperplasia<disease> and could predispose to endometrial carcinogenesis.
