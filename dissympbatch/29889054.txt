  The exact etiopathogenesis of fibromyalgia syndrome<disease> ( FM) is still unclear but the pathogenesis of FM is associated with neurogenic inflammation<symptom>. Allergic rhinitis ( AR) is a common inflammatory and immunological disease of the nasal mucosa. As a result , it is known that neurogenic inflammation<symptom> has a role in the pathophysiology of both FM and AR. The aim of this study was to evaluate AR and nasal allergic inflammation<symptom> using nasal mucociliary clearance time ( NMC) in FM patients. Forty-five FM patients and fifty healthy controls were included in the study. In both groups , AR was evaluated by total nasal symptom scoring ( TNSS) and NMC was measured using saccharine transit time test ( STT). TNSS was positive in 9 patients ( 20 %) in the FM group and no positivity in the control group. In FM group , the mean value of TNSS was higher than that of the control group ( p = 0.0001). The average value of STT of FM patients was statistically significantly longer when compared to the control group ( p = 0.0001). The results we obtained suggest that there is a high possibility of coexistence of FM and AR. As a result , the coexistence of AR and FM can not be denied but we believe that comprehensive clinical studies should be conducted on this subject.
