  Background In 2016 tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) was considered the ninth leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause of a single infectious<disease> agent<disease> , with approximately 1.6 million deaths worldwide and a lethality of 15 %. Over 95 % of cases and deaths are in developing countries like Colombia. To describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients who died during TB treatment in a high complexity hospital in Cali , Colombia. We conducted an analytic retrospective cohort during 2007-2016 in FundaciÃ³n Valle del Lili. We included patients with TB diagnosis , who died during TB treatment. From 787 patients with TB , 69 died ( 8.8 %). Fifty nine percent were male , the average of age was 51.9 years. There was diagnosis delay in 51 % of the patients and 74 % presented pulmonary TB. Sixty four percent 64 died in the first 30 days of the TB diagnosis and 61 % of the deaths were attributable to TB. Twenty five percent of patients had TB/HIV coinfection. Elderly patients ( > 65 years old) were associated with death in the first 30 days of TB diagnosis ( p < 0,001). The lethality found in this study was higher than expected ( 8.8 %) , the majority of patients had serious comorbidities. Elderly patients were associated with early death. The main pathophysiological mechanism of death was septic shock<symptom> caused by severe tuberculous
