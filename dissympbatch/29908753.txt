  Emerging evidence indicates that individuals after an episode of acute pancreatitis<disease> ( AP) are at an increased risk of developing metabolic derangements. While the link between general obesity and insulin resistance ( IR) is well established , only a few studies have investigated the association between abdominal obesity and IR. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between abdominal obesity and several indices of IR in individuals after an episode of AP. Patients were eligible for this cross-sectional study if they were previously admitted with a primary diagnosis of AP based on the recent international guidelines. Fasting venous bloods<symptom> were collected to measure glucose , insulin , free fatty acids , glycerol , adiponectin ( AD) , omentin ( OM) , and vaspin ( VAS). The IR indices- HOMA-IR , Adipo-IR , insulin * glycerol ( IG) index , HOMA-AD , HOMA-OM , and HOMA-VAS were calculated. Modified Poisson regression was conducted , with statistical model adjusting for patient- , metabolic- , and pancreatitis-related risk factors. Areas under ROC curve were calculated and Bland-Altman plots were created. Of the 92 individuals recruited , 41 had abdominal obesity. HOMA-IR , IG index , HOMA-OM , and HOMA-VAS were significantly associated with abdominal obesity , both in unadjusted and adjusted models. Area under ROC curves for HOMA-IR , IG index , HOMA-OM , and HOMA-VAS were 0.698 , 0.695 , 0.756 , and 0.735 , respectively. There was a good agreement between observed HOMA-IR values and values obtained from HOMA-OM ( P = 0.733) and HOMA-VAS ( P = 0.595). Individuals with abdominal obesity after AP have a significantly higher IR , independent of diabetes and other covariates. Visceral adipose tissue specific adipokines , omentin and vaspin , hold promise for future clinical investigation of tissue-specific IR.
