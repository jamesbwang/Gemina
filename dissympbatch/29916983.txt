 : Mandibular reconstruction in pediatric patients is controversial. The scant pediatric experience and the infrequent occurrence of this type of pathology in children complicate therapeutic decisions. The literature contains different treatment protocols and describes the bone graft alternatives to be used. This is a retrospective review of patients under the age of 15 who were subjected to resection and reconstruction. A total of 18 patients were included in the study: 8 women and 10 men. The age on the date of diagnosis ranged from 2 years to 13 years and the average was 7 years. Five patients underwent resective surgery for a malign pathology , 7 for a benign pathology , 4 for aggressive<symptom> lesions<symptom> of odontogenic origin , and 1for the effects of a fracture that was complicated by osteomyelitis<disease> In conclusion , treating pediatric patients with tumor pathology requires an experience pediatric team to get good outcomes. Surgeons must consider that pediatric patients are in constant growth and development but that must not be an issue in resection and reconstruction decisions. Literature review shows that , as in adults , free flaps seem to be the criterion standard for big resections in mandibles defects , and are safe to use in pediatric patients.
