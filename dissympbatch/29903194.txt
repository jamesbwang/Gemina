  To assess the prevalence of thyroid nodules<symptom> and explore the risk factors for thyroid nodules<symptom> among the community residents in Zhejiang Province. The residents of twenty-two communities in Zhejiang Province were selectedwith stratified cluster sampling. The cross-sectional survey includes questionnaire , examination on thyroid. The prevalence and related factors of thyroid nodules<symptom> was described , and the possible risk factors for thyroid nodules<symptom> was analyzed with logistic regression. The prevalence of thyroid nodules<symptom> in Zhejiang was 21. 78 % , and the prevalence of a single nodule<disease> was 11. 75 % , which was higher than that of multiple nodules<symptom> ( 10. 03 %). The prevalence of thyroid nodules<symptom> in men was less than women , urban residents higher than rural , and both increased gradually with age. The residents in coastal areas had the highest prevalence of thyroid nodules<symptom> , followed by sub-coastal areas , inland minimum. High education level , consumption of seafood habits , high frequency of anger , the history of thyroid disease and iodine deficiency were potential risk factors for thyroid nodules<symptom> in this surveyed population. The prevalence of thyroid nodules<symptom> in Zhejiang Province was at the middle level , female prevalence was greater than male , and gradully increased with age , the elderly should be the focus of prevention. Although thyroid nodules<symptom> of children was at the lower rate , it should be paid attention due to high risk to develop to malignancy. High education level , consumption of seafood habits , high frequency of anger , the history of thyroid disease and iodine deficiency were potential risk factors for thyroid nodules<symptom> , which need to be confirmed by further epidemiologic study.
