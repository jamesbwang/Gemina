  Well-balanced levels of tyrosine phosphorylation , maintained by the reversible and coordinated actions of protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPs) , are critical for a wide range of cellular processes including growth , diﬀerentiation , metabolism , migration , and survival. Aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation , as a result of a perturbed balance<symptom> between the activities of PTKs and PTPs , is linked to the pathogenesis of numerous human<disease> diseases<disease> , including cancer , suggesting that PTPs may be innovative molecular targets for cancer treatment. Two PTPs that have an important inhibitory role in haematopoietic cells are SHP-1 and SHP-2. SHP-1 , 2 promote cell growth and act by both upregulating positive signaling pathways and by downregulating negative signaling pathways. SHIP is another inhibitory phosphatase that is specific for the inositol phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate ( PIP3). SHIP acts as a negative regulator of immune response by hydrolysing PIP3 , and SHIP deficiency results in myeloproliferation and B-cell lymphoma in mice. The validation of SHP-1 , 2 and SHIP as oncology targets has generated interest in the development of inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for cancers; however , SHP-1 , 2 and SHIP have proven to be an extremely diﬃcult target for drug discovery , primarily due to the highly conserved and positively charged nature of their PTP active site , and many PTP inhibitors lack either appro-priate selectivity or membrane permeability. To overcome these caveats , novel techniques have been employed to synthesise new inhibitors that specifically attenuate the PTP-dependent signaling inside the cell and amongst them; some are already in clinical development which are discussed in this review.
