  Dexmedetomidine , midazolam and propofol are common sedative drugs used in the intensive care unit. Lipopolysaccharides ( LPS) are a potent inducer of human dendritic cells ( DCs) maturation and survival , which induces cytokine production. The present study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanisms of sedative drugs on LPS-induced cytokine production in DCs. The mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic DC2 .4 cell line was used in the present study. The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to measure the viability of cells. Tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α , interleukin ( IL) -1 β , IL-6 , and IL-10 mRNA expression levels and contents were measured using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and ELISA , respectively. The expression levels of proteins associated with nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB) and mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathways were assessed by western blotting. The three sedatives had different roles on TNF-α , IL-1β , IL-6 , and IL-10 mRNA expression levels and content in DCs. Dexmedetomidine promoted inflammatory cytokine production at high clinical concentrations ( 10 , 1 and 0.1 µM) , however suppressed them at the lowest clinical concentration ( 0.001 µM) , which was associated with NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK)- mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) signaling. Midazolam inhibited inflammatory cytokine production via suppression of the NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways. Propofol partly inhibited inflammatory cytokine production , including IL-1β and IL-6 , and the anti-inflammatory effect may result from inhibition of JNK-MAPK , and enhanced NF-κB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-MAPK signaling at clinical concentrations. The present study helped to elucidate the function of sedatives in LPS-induced cytokine production in DCs , which will facilitate rational implementation of these sedatives in patients undergoing tracheal intubation with sepsis<disease> or multiple organ dysfunction
