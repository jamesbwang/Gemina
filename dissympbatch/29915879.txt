  Acute kidney injury ( AKI) is accompanied with life-threatening sepsis<disease>. It is necessary to develop effective therapy agent or strategy for treating AKI. LPS is a primary pathogenic factor that induces sepsis<disease>. Glucose-regulated protein 78 ( GRP78) is closely related to cell injuries. The objective of this study was to examine the role of GRP78 in LPS-induced AKI. Cell counting kit-8 ( CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry ( FCM) were respectively performed to assess the cell viability and apoptosis. Available commercial kits were used to detect the reactive oxygen species ( ROS) contents and the activity of oxidative indicators. The expressions of the relevant factors were determined by real-time PCR ( RT-PCR) and Western blot. The results showed that the expression of GRP78 was apparently increased by LPS treatment , and that the down-regulation of GRP78 by small RNA interference improved the proliferation ability of renal cells in comparison to LPS group. The LPS-induced immune response and oxidative stress was alleviated by the depletion of GRP78. Moreover , the LPS-induced apoptosis was reduced in the GRP78 group by regulating the expression of mitochondrial apoptosis ( Bcl-2 , Bax) and endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress ( CHOP , caspase-12)- associated proteins. In addition , the protective role of GRP78 reduction was partly related to the balance<symptom> of NF-κB/IκB. Down-regulation of GRP78 attenuated LPS-induced AKI through inhibiting immune response/oxidative stress-associated apoptosis.
