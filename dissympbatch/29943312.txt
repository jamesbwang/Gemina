  The Infrapatellar Fat Pad ( IFP) lies between patella , femur , meniscus and tibia and properly fills the space between these structures. This fatty structure facilitates distribution of synovial fluid and may act to absorb impulsive actions generated through the joint. In case of Osteoarthritis ( OA) , IFP is found to be affected by inflammation<symptom> , hypertrophy and fibrosis<disease>. The aim of the present study is to analyze the correlation between microscopic characteristics and mechanical properties of the IFP in healthy and OA conditions. The microscopic anatomy of the IFP was analyzed through histological methods , whose results showed that the IFP affected by OA maintains similar lobules configuration but thicker interlobular septa. Geometrical data together with the morphological analysis of lobules and septa represented the basic data to provide numerical micro-models of the IFP. Numerical analyses were developed to evaluate the mechanical behavior considering the characteristic loading conditions as compressive , torsion and shear actions. The results were applied to identify the parameters of a homogenized hyperelastic constitutive formulation that interprets the IFP mechanics. The constitutive formulation was implemented within a finite element model of the knee , which was applied to evaluate the overall mechanical functionality of the knee structures. The results pointed out the actual mechanical relevance of IFP and the loss of proper stress-strain behavior of the OA IFP under mechanical loads.
