  The aim of this study is to determine the severity of female sexual dysfunction ( FSD) , quality of life , and depression<symptom> status<symptom> in female patients with Cushing 's syndrome<disease> ( CS). This study included 29 sexually active women with CS and 30 healthy age and body mass index matched women. The Female Sexual Function Index ( FSFI) questionnaire , Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory ( BDI) and Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36) were filled by each participant. Plasma levels of FSH , LH , PRL , cortisol , DHEA-S , 17-hydroxyprogesterone , androstenedione , free testosterone , total testosterone and estradiol were measured. Female sexual dysfunction was present in 88.9 % of the women with CS and 24.1 % of the control group. The CS group showed a lower total FSFI score ( 16.6 ( IQR: 5-23)) compared to the healthy women ( 26.8 ( IQR: 25.5-30.4) ( p < 0.001)). The FSFI scores in the arousal , lubrication , orgasm , pain and satisfaction domains were all lower in the women with CS ( p < 0.001). Both summary scores of the SF-36 were reduced in women with Cushing 's syndrome<disease> compared to the control group ( p = 0.001). The BDI scores of patients were significantly higher than those of the control subjects ( p = 0.007). In patients with CS , levels of LH , estradiol , and DHEA-S04 were significantly lower while cortisol ( p < 0.05) , and 17 hydroxyprogestrone levels were higher than control subjects ( p < 0.05). This study showed that majority of the women with CS had FSD. This may be related to the inhibitory effect of cortisol on sex hormones.
