  To investigate the safety and efficacy of Onabotulinum Toxin-A ( BTX-A) injection to the salivary glands under ultrasound guidance for the treatment of sialorrhea in patients with spinal muscular atrophy type I ( SMA I). Prospective case series with four patients with SMA I who received BTX-A injection to parotid<symptom> and submandibular glands for sialorrhea as part of clinical care. All four patients received validated surveys for measuring drooling , including objective measures of number of bib changes , and number of mouth<symptom> wipes before injection and 4-6 weeks after injection. Research was limited to survey completion. Scales included the Drooling Severity and Frequency Scale and the Drooling Impact Scale as well as a new scale used in our clinic , the Posterior Drooling Scales looking at coughing/choking and number of aspiration pneumonias<disease>. There were no adverse events. All four patients showed clinically significant improvements. The improvement in drooling using the DIS was statistically significant ( Paired-t test , t = 3.243 , P = 0.048). All patients improved with number of mouth<symptom> wipes. Ultrasound guided BTX-A injections to the salivary glands may be a safe and effective method of decreasing drooling in patients with SMA I.
