  To compare endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD) outcomes between Eastern<disease> and Western countries. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using PubMed , MEDLINE , Web of Science , CINAHL and EBM reviews to identify studies published between 1990 and February 2016. The primary outcome was the efficacy of ESD based on information about either curative resection , Overall , 238 publications including 84318 patients and 89512 gastrointestinal lesions<symptom> resected using ESD were identified. 90 % of the identified studies reporting ESD on 87296 lesions<symptom> were conducted in Eastern countries and 10 % of the identified studies reporting ESD outcomes in 2216 lesions<symptom> were from Western countries. Meta-analyses showed higher pooled percentage of curative , Eastern countries show better ESD outcomes compared to Western countries. Availability of local ESD expertise and regional outcomes should be considered for decision making to treat gastrointestinal lesions<symptom> with ESD.
