  A 23-year-old , previously healthy female presented with lower abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and mildly elevated creatinine one month following a right ureter stent for non-specific ureteral thickening causing obstruction. On admission , computed tomography ( CT) revealed moderate hydronephrosis of the left kidney that would require stent placement as well. During stent placement , it was noted that the gross appearance of the ureters resembled ureteritis cystica. Biopsies were taken and showed signs of chronic inflammatory changes consistent with this diagnosis. Interestingly , this patient had no obvious medical history suggesting a cause for this process. She had been otherwise healthy with no recurrent episodes of urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> , nephrolithiasis , or sexually transmitted infection. The patient was discharged symptom-free following stent placement and will follow with urology for future stent replacements and clinical monitoring.
