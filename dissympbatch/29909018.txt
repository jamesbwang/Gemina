  Eosinophilic otitis<disease> media<disease> ( EOM) , which is characterized by the accumulation of eosinophils in middle ear effusion<symptom> and the middle ear mucosa , is a refractory type of otitis<disease> media<disease> that is often associated with asthma. Although an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are necessary to prevent the progression of hearing loss in patients with EOM , there are currently no well-established treatments for this condition. We treated a 60-year-old male patient with asthma and EOM. The patient 's asthma was poorly controlled , despite the use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids , long-acting beta-agonist treatment , and the regular use of systemic corticosteroids. Mepolizumab , an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody , was started to treat the patient 's refractory asthma. At 4 months after the initiation of mepolizumab treatment , the patient 's asthma , hearing , and middle ear effusion<symptom> improved. The present case suggests that mepolizumab therapy can control EOM and asthma.
