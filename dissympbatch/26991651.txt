  Quality of tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) microscopy diagnosis is not a guarantee despite implementation of External Quality Assurance ( EQA) service in all laboratories of health facilities. Hence , we aimed at evaluating the technical quality and the findings of sputum<symptom> smear microscopy for acid fast bacilli ( AFB) at health centers in Hararge Zone , Oromia Region , Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was carried out between July 8 , 2014 and July 7 , 2015. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Lot Quality Assurance Sampling ( LQAS) method was put into practice for collecting all necessary sample slides. Data were analyzed by using SPSS ( Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 20 software. P-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Of the total55 health center laboratories which had been assessed during the study period , 20 ( 36.4 %) had major technical errors; 13 ( 23.6 %) had 15 false negative results and 17 ( 30.9 %) had 22 false positive results. Moreover , poor specimen quality , smear size , smear thickness , staining and evenness were indicated in 40 ( 72.7 %) , 39 ( 70.9 %) , 37 ( 67.3 %) , 27 ( 49.1 %) and 37 ( 67.3 %) of the collected samples , respectively. False negative AFB findings were significantly associated with lack of Internal Quality Control ( IQC) measures ( AOR ( Adjusted Odds Ratio): 2.90 ( 95 % CI ( Confidence Interval): 1.25,6.75) and poor staining procedures ( AOR: 2.16 ( 95 % CI: 1.01 , 5.11). The qualities of AFB smear microscopy reading and smearing were low in most of the laboratories of the health centers. Therefore , it is essential to strength EQA program through building the capacity of laboratory professionals.
