  This review proposes revisions to the current classification system for gingival diseases and provides a rationale for how it differs from the 1999 classification system. Gingival inflammation<symptom> in response to bacterial plaque accumulation ( microbial biofilms) is considered the key risk factor for the onset of periodontitis<disease> Thus , control of gingival inflammation<symptom> is essential for the primary prevention of periodontitis<disease> The clinical characteristics common to dental plaque-induced inflammatory gingival conditions include: a) clinical signs and symptoms of inflammation<symptom> that are confined to the gingiva: b) reversibility of the inflammation<symptom> by removing or disrupting the biofilm; c) the presence of a high bacterial plaque burden to initiate the inflammation<symptom>; d) systemic modifying factors ( e.g. , hormones , systemic disorders , drugs) which can alter the severity of the plaque-induced inflammation<symptom> and; e) stable ( i.e. , non-changing) attachment levels on a periodontium which may or may not have experienced a loss of attachment or alveolar bone. The simplified taxonomy of gingival conditions includes: 1) introduction of the term `` incipient gingivitis<disease> '' 2) a description of the extent and severity of gingival inflammation<symptom>; 3) a description of the extent and severity of gingival enlargement and; 4) a reduction of categories in the dental plaque-induced gingival disease taxonomy. Dental plaque-induced gingival inflammation<symptom> is modified by various systemic and oral factors. The appropriate intervention is crucial for the prevention of
