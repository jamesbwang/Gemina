  Mutations in the human transcription factor gene ZEB2 cause Mowat-Wilson syndrome<disease> , a congenital disorder characterized by multiple and variable anomalies including microcephaly , Hirschsprung disease , intellectual disability , epilepsy , microphthalmia , retinal coloboma , and/or optic nerve hypoplasia. Zeb2 in mice is involved in patterning neural and lens epithelia , neural tube closure , as well as in the specification , differentiation and migration of neural crest cells and cortical neurons. At present , it is still unclear how Zeb2 mutations cause retinal coloboma , whether Zeb2 inactivation results in retinal degeneration , and whether Zeb2 is sufficient to promote the differentiation of different retinal cell types. Here , we show that during mouse retinal development , Zeb2 is expressed transiently in early retinal progenitors and in all non-photoreceptor cell types including bipolar , amacrine , horizontal , ganglion , and MÃ¼ller glial cells. Its retina-specific ablation causes severe<symptom> loss<symptom> of all non-photoreceptor cell types , cell fate switch to photoreceptors by retinal progenitors , and elevated apoptosis , which lead to age-dependent retinal degeneration , optic nerve hypoplasia , synaptic connection defects , and impaired ERG ( electroretinogram) responses. Moreover , overexpression of Zeb2 is sufficient to promote the fate of all non-photoreceptor cell types at the expense of photoreceptors. Together , our data not only suggest that Zeb2 is both necessary and sufficient for the differentiation of non-photoreceptor cell types while simultaneously inhibiting the photoreceptor cell fate by repressing transcription factor genes involved in photoreceptor specification and differentiation , but also reveal a necessity of Zeb2 in the long-term maintenance of retinal cell types. This work helps to decipher the etiology of retinal atrophy associated with Mowat-Wilson syndrome<disease> and hence will impact on clinical diagnosis and management of the patients suffering from this
