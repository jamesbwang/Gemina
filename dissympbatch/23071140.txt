  Understanding the complex interaction of risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing common diseases is challenging. The Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project ( CPTP) is a prospective cohort study created as a population-health research platform for assessing the effect of genetics , behaviour , family health history and environment ( among other factors) on chronic<disease> diseases<disease>. Volunteer participants were recruited from the general Canadian population for a confederation of 5 regional cohorts. Participants were enrolled in the study and core information obtained using 2 approaches: attendance at a study assessment centre for all study measures ( questionnaire , venous blood sample and physical measurements) or completion of the core questionnaire ( online or paper) , with later collection of other study measures where possible. Physical measurements included height , weight , percentage body fat and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. Participants consented to passive follow-up through linkage with administrative health databases and active follow-up through recontact. All participant data across the 5 regional cohorts were harmonized. A total of 307 017 participants aged 30-74 from 8 provinces were recruited. More than half provided a venous blood sample and/or other biological sample , and 33 % completed physical measurements. A total of 709 harmonized variables were created; almost 25 % are available for all participants and 60 % for at least 220 000 participants. Primary recruitment for the CPTP is complete , and data and biosamples are available to Canadian and international researchers through a data-access process. The CPTP will support research into how modifiable risk factors , genetics and the environment interact to affect the development of cancer and other chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , ultimately contributing evidence to reduce the global burden of
