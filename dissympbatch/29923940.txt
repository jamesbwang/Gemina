  Acute chest syndrome<disease> is the leading cause of death in children with sickle cell disease and is generally due to respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom>. Epidemiologic factors for a need for mechanical ventilation in children with acute chest syndrome<disease> require further clarification. Retrospective observational study. Nationally representative pediatric inpatient records in the United States by using the Kids ' Inpatient Database for the years 2003 , 2006 , 2009 , and 2012. Patients age less than 20 years old with a discharge diagnosis of acute chest syndrome<disease>. Data were weighted to estimate annual hospitalizations according to hospital characteristics in the United States. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to ascertain factors associated with use of mechanical ventilation , after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. Total hospitalizations for acute chest syndrome<disease> were 5,018 in 2003 , 6,058 in 2006 , 6,072 in 2009 , and 6,360 in 2012. Mechanical ventilation use was associated with comorbidities of obesity ( odds ratio , 3.35; 95 % CI , 1.94-5.78) , obstructive sleep apnea ( odds ratio , 3.72; 95 % CI , 2.23-6.20) , and heart disease ( odds ratio , 2.19; 95 % CI , 1.47-3.27). In addition , nonblack compared with black children ( odds ratio , 1.53; 95 % CI , 1.02-2.31) and the fall season ( p = 0.018) were associated with mechanical ventilation use. Comorbidity of obesity , obstructive sleep apnea , or heart disease could be potentially associated with mechanical ventilation use during an episode of acute chest syndrome<disease>. Prospective observational studies would be required to confirm these findings and infer potential interventions for preventing illness severity.
