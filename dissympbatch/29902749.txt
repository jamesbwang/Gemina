  The influence of nitrogen ( N) deposition on forest<disease> ecosystems largely depend on the N status. Developing threshold and practical indicators for N saturation in subtropical forests , with extremely high N deposition , would both enhance forest<disease> management and the assessments of global N balance<symptom> and carbon ( C) sequestration. Here , we quantified the N mass balance<symptom> and assessed current N status at a number of subtropical forest<disease> sites in South China , using both N content , C/N ratio , and
