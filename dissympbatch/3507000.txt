  Composite resin ( CR) currently is one of the most commonly used material in restoring noncarious cervical<symptom> lesions<symptom> ( NCCL) due to its strength and esthetics color but has microleakage problem. The aim of this study is to compare This an Porcelain cervical inlay restorations demonstrated statistically lesser microleakage depth for the cervical margins ( Porcelain cervical inlays show lesser microleakage than CR which could be alternative treatment option in restoring NCCL with better marginal seal<disease> and esthetics.
