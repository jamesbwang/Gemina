  In situ fenestration may be necessary to preserve branch arteries during thoracic endovascular aortic repair ( TEVAR) when there is an inadequate landing zone. We report the case of a 74-year-old man presenting with recurrent hemoptysis<symptom>. Based on computed tomography ( CT) angiogram and bronchoscopy , diagnosis was aorto-bronchial fistula<disease>. We performed retrograde in situ fenestration with reentry catheter ( Pioneer Plus , Volcano Corporation , San Diego , CA) to preserve the left subclavian artery following TEVAR for aorto-bronchial fistula<disease>. Following this procedure , the patient had a patent left subclavian artery and no evidence of endoleak. The patient had no further episodes of hemoptysis<symptom>. The retrograde in situ fenestration with reentry catheter strategy is an option for patients when carotid-subclavian bypass is deemed unsafe.
