  Vaginal mesh safety information is limited , especially concerning single incision techniques using ultra lightweight meshes for the treatment of anterior pelvic organ prolapse ( POP). To determine the intraoperative and postoperative complication rates after anterior POP repair involving an ultralight mesh ( 19g/m A case series of 218 consecutive patients , operated on between January 2013 and December 2016 in ten tertiary and secondary care centres , was retrospectively analyzed. Eligible patients had POP vaginal repair ( recurrent or not) planned with anterior Restorelle Intraoperative complications were bladder wound<disease> ( 0.5 %) , rectal<disease> wound<disease> ( 0.5 %) , ureteral injuries ( 0.9 %). 98.2 % of the patient did not have per operative complications. We observed one fail of procedure. Early complications mainly included urinary<symptom> retention<symptom> ( 8.7 %) urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> ( 5.5 %) and haematoma ( 2.7 %). One haematoma required surgical treatment and another , embolization. 80.7 % of the patient did not have complications during hospitalization and 80.3 % did not have complication at the follow up visit. None of the analyzed factors ( age , body mass index , surgical history , grade of prolapse or concomitant procedure) was significantly associated with the risk of perioperative complications. A total of 2.8 % patients had grade III complications according Clavien Dindo. None had grade IV or V. This multicentre case-series on the early experience of the use of anterior Restorelle
