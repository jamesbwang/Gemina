  Gastrointestinal multiple metastases of lung cancer are extremely rare. The majority of gastrointestinal metastasis cases are diagnosed at a late stage and the prognosis is extremely poor. This report describes the clinical characteristics and outcomes of a patient with gastrointestinal multiple metastases from squamous-cell lung cancer , with special emphasis on the diagnosis and treatment of metastatic lung cancer. A 61-year-old man who presented with progressive<symptom> abdominal<symptom> distention<symptom> was admitted to our hospital. Radiological examinations showed changes of post-primary pulmonary tuberculosis<disease> and mechanical obstruction of the small bowl. Histopathological findings of gastroscopic examination and biopsy specimens showed a diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma in the body of the stomach. Postoperative histopathology confirmed a gastrointestinal multiple squamous-cell carcinoma in stomach and small bowl. Finally , squamous-cell lung cancer was confirmed by lung biopsy. During his hospitalization urgent surgery was performed because of acute abdomen. The patient underwent a laparotomy with curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer and small bowel partial resection. The patient was recommended with combination chemotherapy of carboplatin and paclitaxel for 3 cycles. Six months later after operation , the patient succumbed to respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom>. We searched the related literature of gastrointestinal metastases from lung cancer and the clinical presentation , site of metastasis , diagnosis , treatment , and survival time in these cases were reviewed. The present study may increase the awareness of early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of metastatic lung cancer of gastrointestinal tract.
