  Deep brain stimulation ( DBS) surgery has proven benefit for several movement disorders and medically-refractory psychiatric conditions and is considered a fairly safe procedure. We sought to determine the national rates , causes , predictors , and outcomes associated with 30-day and 90-day readmission. The Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried ( January-September 2013) using ICD-9-CM codes , identifying patients who underwent DBS for movement disorder ( Parkinson 's disease ( PD) , essential tremor<symptom> ( ET) , or dystonia). Variables included categorical age , gender , insurance , comorbidities , type of movement disorder , length of stay ( LOS) , total costs , and discharge disposition. A total of 3392 DBS patients were identified ( PD ( 70.7 %) , ET ( 25.6 %) , dystonia ( 3.7 %)). The mean age was 64.8 Â± 0.4 years old and 37 % were female. The rates of unplanned readmissions was 1.9 % at 30-days and 4.3 % at 90 days. The overall NRD incidence ( all patient populations) of 30-day readmission is 11.6 %. Readmissions most frequently resulted from surgical complications including hematoma and attention to surgical wounds<disease> Elderly , obese , and those with comorbidities such as history of stroke or CAD are at highest risk. The average LOS , mean total cost , and rate of adverse discharge were worse for 30-day ( 9 days , $ 64,520 , 71.7 %) compared to 90-day readmission ( 6 days , $ 52,183 , 56.5 %). All-cause , unplanned readmission for DBS was 1.9 % within 30-days and 4.3 % within 90-days. Risk factors for readmission in our study , such as advanced age and multiple medical comorbidities , are not unique to DBS. Unplanned readmissions are much rarer following DBS compared to most hospital discharges but can occasionally lead to additional costs and rare complications including hematoma , stroke , and wound<disease> infection<disease> DBS should continue to be viewed as a safe and effective treatment modality for a wide range of neurological ailments.
