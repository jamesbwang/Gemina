  Functional gastrointestinal disorders ( FGIDs) , such as irritable bowel syndrome<disease> ( IBS) and chronic constipation<symptom> ( CC) , are commonly diagnosed conditions in clinical practice which create a substantial global burden. Since the farnesoid X receptor ( FXR) and bile acids ( BAs) are responsible for maintaining homeostasis in the GI tract , any disturbances in the expression of FXR or the composition of BAs may contribute to the development of the GI symptoms. Alterations in the mechanism of action of FXR directly affect the BAs pool and account for increased intestinal permeability and changes in abundance and diversity of gut microbiota leading to intestinal dysmotility. Current review focuses on the correlation between the FXR , BAs and the composition of gut microbiota and its influence on the occurrence of GI symptoms in FGIDs.
