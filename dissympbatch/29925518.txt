  Polycystic kidney disease ( PKD) and other renal ciliopathies are characterized by cysts<symptom> , inflammation<symptom> , and fibrosis<disease>. Cilia function as signaling centers , but a molecular link to inflammation<symptom> in the kidney has not been established. Here , we show that cilia in renal epithelia activate chemokine signaling to recruit inflammatory cells. We identify a complex of the ciliary kinase LKB1 and several ciliopathy-related proteins including NPHP1 and PKD1. At homeostasis , this ciliary module suppresses expression of the chemokine CCL2 in tubular epithelial cells. Deletion of LKB1 or PKD1 in mouse renal tubules elevates CCL2 expression in a cell-autonomous manner and results in peritubular accumulation of CCR2
