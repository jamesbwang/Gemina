  To examine the six-year prognosis of patients with late-life depression<symptom> and to identify prognostic factors of an unfavorable course. The Netherlands Study of Depression<symptom> in Older Persons ( NESDO) is a multisite naturalistic prospective cohort study with six-year follow-up. Three hundred seventy-eight clinically depressed patients ( according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition Text Revision criteria) and 132 nondepressed comparisons were included at baseline between 2007 and 2010. Depression<symptom> was measured by the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology at 6-month intervals and a diagnostic interview at 2- and 6-year follow-up. Multinomial regression and mixed model analyses were both used to identify depression-related clinical , health , and psychosocial prognostic factors of an unfavorable course. Among depressed patients at baseline , 46.8 % were lost to follow-up; 15.9 % had an unfavorable course , i.e. , chronic or recurrent; 24.6 % had partial remission; and 12.7 % had full remission at six-year follow-up. The relative risk of mortality in depressed patients was 2.5 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.26-4.81) versus nondepressed comparisons. An unfavorable course of depression<symptom> was associated with a younger age at depression<symptom> onset; higher symptom severity of depression<symptom> , pain , and neuroticism; and loneliness at baseline. Additionally , partial remission was associated with chronic<disease> diseases<disease> and loneliness at baseline when compared with full remission. The long-term prognosis of late-life depression<symptom> is poor with regard to mortality and course of depression<symptom>. Chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , loneliness , and pain may be used as putative targets for optimizing prevention and treatment strategies for relapse and chronicity.
