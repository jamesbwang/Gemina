  Background Neuropathic pain remains a significant challenge with unsatisfactory therapeutic options. Its pathogenesis may involve the neuropathic triad of neuronal , glial and immune cells. Communication between these cells is possibly perpetuated by mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK)- signaling. For several years , we successfully treated a rectal cancer patient with the epithelial growth factor receptor ( EGFR)- inhibitor cetuximab , for debilitating neuropathic pain due to progressive malignant invasion of the sacral plexus. Here , we report the effect of treatment with various EGFR-inhibitors in five additional patients with severe and long-standing , therapy-resistant neuropathic pain. Methods All patients had well-documented neuropathic pain syndromes<disease> with the following etiologies: inflammatory polyneuropathy , complex regional pain syndrome<disease> type 1 , radiculopathy after failed back surgery , malignant invasion of the sacral plexus by bladder cancer , and phantom limb<symptom> pain<symptom>. All patients were given intravenous ( extracellular) EGFR-inhibitors ( cetuximab , panitumumab) initially , and switched to oral ( intracellular) agents ( gefitinib , erlotinib) after an analgesic effect was obtained. Results Four of the five patients responded , all within 24h of intravenous administration , with a mean decrease in worst pain from 9 to 1 on a 10-point scale. All four EGFR-inhibitors were effective. The clinical courses , including patient-reported pain relief , are prospectively documented with 78-219 days follow-up for those who responded to treatment. Toxicities were transient and manageable. Conclusions/implications EGFR-inhibition resulted in dramatic relief of neuropathic pain. A plausible biological explanation involves the interruption of MAPK-signaling. The role of EGFR-inhibition as a target for the treatment of neuropathic pain appears promising and warrants investigation.
