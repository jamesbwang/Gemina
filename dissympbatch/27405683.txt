  Dengue<disease> fever<disease> during pregnancy is an expanding issue in Southeast Asia; however , the knowledge of adverse effects on mothers and neonates remains limited. Therefore , we aimed to determine the impact of dengue<disease> fever<disease>. The clinical information of 20 patients of dengue<disease> fever<disease> during pregnancy in Vietnam from January 1 , 2015 to December 31 , 2015 was collected and their outcomes were retrospectively investigated. A total of 18 patients ( 90 %) presented with positivity of nonstructural protein 1 , and a primary infection. Additionally , 4 patients ( 20 %) had preterm deliveries and 1 ( 5 %) had a stillborn child. All live-born neonates were discharged from the hospital uneventfully. Also , 6 patients ( 30 %) required platelet transfusion and 3 of them received transfusion before delivery , but there were no maternal death. In addition , 3 cases of patients ( 15 %) developed to postpartum hemorrhage<symptom> ( PPH) , and their platelet concentrations were significantly lower than those of patients without PPH ( 90.0 ( 19.0- 374.0) Ã— 10
