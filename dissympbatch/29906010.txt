  Fixed drug eruption ( FDE) is an adverse drug reaction characterized by the development of well-circumscribed , round , dusky erythematous macules and plaques on cutaneous or mucosal surfaces. The reaction occurs on the same mucosal or cutaneous site with subsequent exposures to the offending drug. Although FDE usually manifests as a single lesion<symptom> , in rare instances , more than one lesion<symptom> may arise and this is referred to as a generalized eruption. Herein , we present a 31year-old man with history of cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> who developed a generalized fixed drug eruption to piperacillin/tazobactam ( Zosyn , Pfizer). We discuss our patient 's course and review causes and outcomes of generalized fixed drug eruptions in the literature.
