  Laminarin , mainly found in the fronds of Laminaria , has antimicrobial characteristics and induces immune responses. However , there are no available information to show the laminarin effect on glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( GOT) and glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( GPT) levels in mice with leukemia<disease> in vivo. Fifty normal BALB/c mice were separated randomly into five groups. Group I mice received normal diet as control. Leukemia<disease> was generated in groups II-V using WEHI-3 cells: Group II mice received normal diet as positive control; group III , IV and V mice received laminarin at 1 , 2.5 and 5 mg/ml with ddH Laminarin did not affect animal appearances , but increased the body<symptom> weight at all doses. It reduced the weight of liver at 2.5 and 5 mg/ml and of spleen at 5 mg/ml. Laminarin increased CD3 ( 2.5 mg/ml) and CD19 ( 1 and 5 mg/ml) cell populations but reduced CD11b ( 5 mg/ml) cell populations , however , these did not affect Mac-3 marker level. Laminarin at 1 mg/ml increased phagocytosis by macrophages from peripheral blood mononuclear cell , but did not affect those from the peritoneal cavity. Laminarin increased NK cell cytotoxic activity at all doses and at a target ratio of 25:1 and 50:1. Laminarin did not affect B-cell proliferation , but at 5 mg/ml significantly reduced T-cell proliferation. Laminarin restored glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase ( 2.5 and 5 mg/ml) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase ( 2.5 mg/ml) levels. Based on these results , we suggest that laminarin can promote immune responses and protect against liver injury.
