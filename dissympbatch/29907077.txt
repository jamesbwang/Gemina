  The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effect of chlorhexidine at different concentration and frequency on ventilator-associated<disease> pneumonia<disease> and microbial colonization in mechanically ventilated patients. Relevant studies in English language were identified by searching data bases between January 2010 and December 2017. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Chlorhexidine with 0.2 % concentration was found to be more effective than the control group ( placebo dental gel and normal saline) in preventing the development of ventilator-associated<disease> pneumonia<disease> in three of the eight studies. Twice-daily application was found to be effective reducing the rate of ventilator-associated<disease> pneumonia<disease> in three studies using 0.2 % and 2 % chlorhexidine. Microbial colonization was found to be less in 2 % chlorhexidine group than herbal mouth<symptom> wash 0.9 % NaCl and 0.2 % chlorhexidine in three studies. Chlorhexidine is an effective intervention in oral care for ventilator-associated<disease> pneumonia<disease> and microbial colonization.
