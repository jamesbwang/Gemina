  This investigation examined the prevalence , symptoms , risk factors , and quality-of-life burden of swallowing disorders in rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) , a chronic , progressive autoimmune inflammatory<disease> disease<disease>. One hundred individuals with RA ( 84 women , 16 men; mean age = 61.1 years , SD = 13.1) were interviewed regarding the presence , nature , and impact of swallowing symptoms and disorders. Associations between swallowing disorders , medical factors , RA disease severity , and quality of life were examined. Forty-one percent of participants reported a current swallowing disorder that began gradually and was longstanding ( most experiencing symptoms on a daily basis for at least 4 years). Symptoms compatible with solid food dysphagia<symptom> contributed disproportionately to reporting a current swallowing disorder. Risk factors for dysphagia<symptom> included a self-reported voice disorder , thyroid problems , esophageal reflux , and being physically inactive. Swallowing disorders increased with self-reported RA disease severity and contributed to a significantly greater burden on overall quality of life. Chronic , longstanding swallowing disorders are common in individuals with RA and appear to increase with disease severity. Those individuals with dysphagia<symptom> reported greater reductions in quality of life as compared to those without , highlighting the need for improved awareness , exploration , and management of swallowing disorders in this population.
