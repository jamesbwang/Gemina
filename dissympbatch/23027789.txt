  To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of acquired long QT syndrome<disease> ( LQTS) on admission to a general Intensive Care Unit ( ICU) , and to assess the risk of LQTS associated with prescribed medications. Prospective observational , cross-sectional study approved by the Institutional Review Board. Between May 2014 and July 2016 , 412 patients > 18 years-old consecutively admitted to the ICU of a university hospital were included. LQTS was defined as a QT interval on the admission electrocardiogram corrected using Bazett 's formula ( QTc) > 460 ms for men and > 470 ms for women. All medications administered within 24 hours before admission were recorded. Logistic regression was used. LQTS prevalence was 27.9 %. In LQTS patients , 70.4 % had â‰¥ 1 LQTS-inducing drug prescribed in the 24 hours prior to ICU admission versus 70.4 % in non-LQTS patients ( p = 0.99). Bradycardia<symptom> and Charlson morbidity index score are independent risk factors for LQTS. Haloperidol ( OR 4.416) , amiodarone ( OR 2.509) and furosemide ( OR 1.895) were associated with LQTS , as well as another drug not yet described , namely clopidogrel ( OR 2.241). The LQTS is highly prevalent in critically ill patients , ICU patients are often admitted with LQTS-inducing medications , and patients with slow heart rate or with high Charlson comorbidity index should be evaluated for LQTS.
