  In this review we compile results cited in reliable journals that show a ratio for the use of pulsed electromagnetic fields ( PEMF) in therapy , indeed. This is true especially for chronically inflamed joints. Furthermore , we try to link this therapeutic approach to the molecular background of chronic inflammation<symptom> and arthritis<disease>. At first we start with the clinical outcome of PEMF therapy. Then , we look for possible triggers and an electromagnetic counterpart that is endogenously inherent in cell biology and in the tissues of interest. Finally , we want to investigate causal molecular and cellular mechanisms of possible PEMF actions. It shows that there are endogenous mechanisms , indeed , which can act as triggers for PEMF like the resting membrane potential as well as resonance mechanisms in charged moieties like membrane transporters. Especially voltage-gated calcium channels can be triggered. These may lead into specific signaling pathways and also may elicit nitric oxide as well as moderate radical reactions , which can ultimately lead to e.g. NFÎºB-like reactions. Concerted in the right way , these reactions can cause a kind of cell protection and ultimately lead to a dampening of inflammatory signals like interleukins.
