  Cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR)- identified late gadolinium enhancement ( LGE) , representing regional fibrosis<disease> , is often used to predict ventricular arrhythmia risk in nonischemic cardiomyopathy ( NICM). However , LGE is more closely correlated with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia<symptom> ( SMVT) than ventricular fibrillation ( VF). We characterized CMR findings of ventricular LGE in VF survivors. We examined consecutively resuscitated VF survivors undergoing contrast-enhanced 1.5 T CMR between 9/2007 and 7/2016. We excluded coronary artery disease , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , amyloid , sarcoid , arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy , and channelopathy. Preexisting implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD) was a CMR contraindication. VF patients were divided into three groups: ( 1) NICM , ( 2) left ventricular ( LV) dilatation with normal LV ejection fraction ( LVEF) , and ( 3) normal LV size and LVEF. Two groups of NICM patients with and without SMVT were examined for comparison. We analyzed 87 VF patients , and found that LGE was seen in 8/22 ( 36 %) with NICM ( LVEF 38 ± 11 % , LV end-diastolic volume index ( LVEDVI) 134 ± 68 mL/BSA) , 11/40 ( 28 %) with LV dilatation and normal LVEF ( LVEDVI 103 ± 17 mL/BSA) , 4/25 ( 16 %) with normal LV size and LVEF. Incidence of LGE in NICM patients without prior ventricular tachycardia/VF ( LVEF 36 ± 12 % , LVEDVI 141 ± 46 mL/body surface area ( BSA)) was 117/277 and was not lower than those with VF and NICM ( 42 % vs 36 %; P = 0.59). By contrast , 22/37 NICM patients with SMVT ( LVEF 42 ± 11 % , LVEDVI 123 ± 48 mL/BSA) were LGE-positive ( 59 % NICM-SMVT vs 36 % NICM-VF; P = 0.04). Most VF survivors with a diagnosis of NICM did not have LGE on CMR and would not have met primary prevention ICD criteria based on LVEF. Absence of LGE may not portend a benign prognosis in NICM. Novel strategies for determining SCD risk in this cohort are required.
