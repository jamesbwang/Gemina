  Acute encephalopathy causes various sequelae , including motor disabilities and intellectual delays. Previous studies reported that cognitive impairments can also occur after acute encephalitis<disease>. Although the incidence of acute encephalopathy is high in Japan , there have been few reports on its sequelae. To characterize the neurological outcomes of pediatric patients who sought motor rehabilitation for motor<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> after acute encephalopathy. Subjects were 26 children who were healthy before suffering from motor<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> following acute encephalopathy and were referred to our pediatric rehabilitation institute during a 9-year period ( August 2007-April 2017). We examined subjects ' neurological status and followed sequelae for at least 8 months. Of 26 individuals , 21 became ambulatory after several months or years during the observation period. Patients who could sit without support within 5 months after the onset of acute encephalopathy were able to walk within several months or years. Patients showing high intensity on T2-weighted sequences or `` bright tree appearance '' in the frontal region took an average of 7 months to develop walking , which was longer than other patients. Among ambulatory subjects , 16 ( 76 %) exhibited mild to moderate intellectual delay with a developmental quotient ( DQ) under 70 , and 20 ( 95 %) exhibited cognitive impairment. There was a significant correlation between DQ scores and motor disability ( p = 0.013 , r = -0.481). Although 80 % of patients who had motor<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> caused by acute encephalopathy and visited out motor rehabilitation outpatient clinic were eventually able to walk , the time taken to develop walking ability depended on which region exhibited magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities. DQ scores and motor disability were significantly correlated.
