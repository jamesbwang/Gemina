  To examine the potential beneficial effect of platelet rich plasma ( PRP) and fibrin sealant ( TISSEEL; Baxter Healthcare Corporation , Deerfield , IL) on bowel wound<disease> healing after shaving of an experimentally induced endometriotic lesion<symptom>. Single-blind , randomized study ( Canadian Task Force classification I). Certified animal research facility. Thirty female Sprague-Dawley rats. Experimental colonic endometriosis was induced by transplanting endometrial tissue to all animals ( first surgery). Thirty rats were then randomized to 1 of 3 groups according to treatment: PRP ( group I , n = 10) , fibrin sealant ( group II , n = 10) , or no agent ( group III , n = 10) was applied after shaving of the endometriotic nodule<disease> ( second surgery). Colonic endometriosis was successfully induced in all subjects. Four days following the second surgery , the animals were euthanized , and microscopic evaluation was performed. The pathologist was blinded to the treatment method. Histopathologic analysis revealed that compared with the control group , collagen disposition was found in significantly higher expression in both the PRP and fibrin sealant groups ( p = .011 and p = .011 , respectively). Distortion of the integrity of the colon layers was statistically more pronounced in the control group compared with the fibrin sealant group ( p = .033) while greater new blood vessel formation was observed in the fibrin sealant group compared with control ( p = .023). No histologic evidence of residual or recurrent disease was detected. Both PRP and fibrin sealant appear to be safe and associated with improved tissue healing during shaving for the excision of colonic endometriosis , attributed to the enhanced collagen disposition , neovascularization , and protection of the integrity of colon layers. Clinical trials are warranted to confirm the feasibility of PRP and fibrin sealant in the clinical setting.
