  Cortical subarachnoid haemorrhage ( cSAH) has multiple aetiologies. No prospective study has reported the long-term progression of the condition. The objective of this study is to describe the clinical and aetiological characteristics of patients with cSAH and to gain insight into prognosis. We performed a prospective , observational , multi-centre study. Data on clinical and radiological variables were collected; during a one-year follow-up period , we recorded data on mortality , dependence , rebleeding , and the appearance of dementia. The study included 34 patients ( mean age , 68.3 years; range , 27-89). The most frequent symptoms were headache<symptom> and focal neurological deficits , which were frequently transient and recurrent. CT scans returned pathological findings in 28 patients ( 85 %). Brain MRI scans were performed in 30 patients ( 88 %) , revealing acute ischaemia in 10 ( 29 %) , old haemorrhage in 7 ( 21 %) , and superficial siderosis in 2 ( 6 %). Aetiology was identified in 26 patients ( 76.5 %): causes were cerebral amyloid angiopathy in 8 , ischaemic stroke in 5 , vasculitis in 4 , reversible posterior encephalopathy in 2 , venous thrombosis in 2 , reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome<disease> in 2 , carotid occlusion in 1 , Marfan syndrome<disease> in 1 , and meningeal carcinomatosis in 1. Three patients died during follow-up ( 2 due to causes related to the cause of cSAH). Three patients developed dementia , 3 had lobar haemorrhages , and one had a second cSAH. The most frequent causes of cSAH in our series were cerebral amyloid angiopathy , ischaemic stroke , and vasculitis. This type of haemorrhage has a worse prognosis than other non-aneurysmal cSAH. There are numerous possible causes , and prognosis depends on the aetiology. In elderly patients , intracranial haemorrhage is frequently associated with cognitive impairment.
