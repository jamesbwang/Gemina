  Hydrocephalus<symptom> , a disorder of impaired cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) homeostasis , often results from an imbalance between CSF production and reabsorption. Rarely , hydrocephalus<symptom> is the consequence of CSF hypersecretion in the context of diffuse villous hyperplasia<disease> of the choroid plexus ( DVHCP). The limited genetic information in previously reported cases suggests a high prevalence of gains of chromosome 9p in this disease , although the critical genes involved in DVHCP pathogenesis have not been identified. Here , we report a patient with syndromic hydrocephalus<symptom> with DVHCP associated with a novel 9p24.3-11.2 triplication and 15q13.2-q13.3 microdeletion. We review the clinical , radiological , and pathological features of DVHCP , as well as its surgical management. A better understanding of the genetic basis of DVHCP could spurn the development of rational , targeted non-surgical hydrocephalus<symptom> treatments.
