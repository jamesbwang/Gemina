  To summarize current evidence on the links between joint hypermobility ( JH) and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes<disease> ( EDS) , with pain and reduced bone mass; to illustrate an updated approach to JH and EDS. In 2017 , a novel classification for EDS and JH has been published. Increasing data demonstrate that pain is a major disability determinator in JH and EDS. Recent findings confirm a complex pathogenesis for pain in JH and EDS and suggest a potential role for joint<symptom> instability<symptom> , central sensitization and small fiber neuropathy. Some papers present bone mass reduction as an associated feature of JH and EDS. The association is preliminary and reflects heterogeneous mechanisms. Assessment of patients with JH/EDS is now well-structured and based on an integrated approach of clinical evaluations and molecular testing. Pain and reduced bone mass are possibly common satellite manifestations of JH/EDS and need expert consult for appropriate interpretation and management.
