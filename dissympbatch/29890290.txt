  Wobbler mice are experimental models for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. As such they show motoneuron degeneration , motor deficits , and astrogliosis and microgliosis of the spinal cord. Additionally , Wobbler mice show increased plasma , spinal cord and brain corticosterone levels and focal adrenocortical hyperplasia<disease> , suggesting a pathogenic role for glucocorticoids in this disorder. Considering this endocrine background , we examined whether the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR) modulator CORT 113176 prevents spinal cord neuropathology of Wobblers. CORT 113176 shows high affinity for the GR , with low or null affinity for other steroid receptors. We employed five-month-old genotyped Wobbler mice that received s.c. vehicle or 30 mg/kg/day for 4 days of CORT 113176 dissolved in sesame oil. The mice were used on the 4th day , 2 h after the last dose of CORT 113176. Vehicle-treated Wobbler mice presented vacuolated motoneurons , increased glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP) + astrocytes and decreased glutamine synthase ( GS) + cells. There was strong neuroinflammation , shown by increased staining for IBA1 + microglia and CD11b mRNA , enhanced expression of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-Î± , its cognate receptor TNFR1 , toll-like receptor 4 , the inducible nitric oxide synthase , NFkB and the high-mobility group box 1 protein ( HMGB1). Treatment of Wobbler mice with CORT 113176 reversed the abnormalities of motoneurons and down-regulated proinflammatory mediators and glial reactivity. Expression of glutamate transporters GLT1 and GLAST mRNAs and GLT1 protein was significantly enhanced over untreated Wobblers. In summary , antagonism of GR with CORT 113176 prevented neuropathology and showed anti-inflammatory and anti-glutamatergic effects in the spinal cord of Wobbler mice.
