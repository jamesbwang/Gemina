  Skin metastases , as a presenting symptom of gastrointestinal malignancies , are very rare and signify aggressive disease. They usually occur after a long period of diagnosis and along with other visceral metastases. We present the case of an 18-year-old male with diffuse subcutaneous metastases as a presenting feature and as the only site of distant metastases due to rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma. They clinically mimic benign skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> and the patient might not present to an oncologist. The diagnosis has to be established by skin biopsy , which will show tumor cell infiltration of the epidermis , dermis , and/or subcutaneous fat. There is no established local treatment for diffuse lesions<symptom>. Systemic chemotherapy indicated for metastatic colon carcinoma was employed with not much favorable response. Irinotecan based chemotherapy also resulted in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome<disease> in this patient. Overall , the disease carries a poor prognosis and with no effective treatment available the survival is less than a year.
