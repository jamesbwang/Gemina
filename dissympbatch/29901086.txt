  Although enteral nutrition therapy for inflammatory bowel disease has been confirmed to be an effective treatment method , the exact mechanism responsible for the effects of enteral nutrition remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of exclusive enteral nutrition ( EEN) against colitis<disease> , and to elucidate the potential mechanisms by inhibiting p65 activation via regulating the p38/mitogen and stress‑activated protein kinase‑1 ( MSK1) pathway. Experiments were performed by establishing dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS) mice colitis<disease> and picrylsulfonic acid solution ( TNBS) induced rat colitis<disease> , and the results demonstrated that EEN treatment attenuated body<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , colon length shortening and colonic pathological damage caused by colitis<disease>. EEN also inhibited inflammatory cells infiltration and decreased myeloperoxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase activities. Furthermore , EEN significantly reduced the production of pro‑inflammatory mediators in serum and the colon. Mechanically , EEN suppressed activation of p65 by inhibiting the p38/MSK1 pathway. In conclusion , the present study demonstrated that EEN attenuated DSS and TNBS‑induced colitis<disease> by inhibiting p65 activation via regulating the p38/MSK1 pathway , thus suggesting that EEN is effective in the treatment of
