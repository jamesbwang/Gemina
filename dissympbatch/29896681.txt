  Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV) is the primary cause of infectious<disease> mononucleosis<disease> and is associated with several malignancies , including nasopharyngeal carcinoma , gastric carcinoma , Hodgkin lymphoma , Burkitt lymphoma , and lymphomas in immunocompromised persons , as well as multiple sclerosis. A vaccine is currently unavailable. While monomeric EBV gp350 was shown in a phase 2 trial to reduce the incidence of infectious<disease> mononucleosis<disease> , but not the rate of EBV infection , newer formulations of gp350 including multimeric forms , viruslike particles , and nanoparticles may be more effective. A vaccine that also includes additional viral glycoproteins , lytic proteins , or latency proteins might improve the effectiveness of an EBV gp350 vaccine. Clinical trials to determine if an EBV vaccine can reduce the rate of infectious<disease> mononucleosis<disease> or posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease should be performed. The former is important since infectious<disease> mononucleosis<disease> can be associated with debilitating fatigue<symptom> as well as other complications , and EBV infectious<disease> mononucleosis<disease> is associated with increased rates of Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple sclerosis. A vaccine to reduce EBV posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease would be an important proof of principle to prevent an EBV-associated malignancy. Trials of an EBV vaccine to reduce the incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma , multiple sclerosis , or Burkitt lymphoma would be difficult but feasible.
