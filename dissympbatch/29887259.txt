  This study investigated the clinical outcomes according to the preoperative nutritional status and to identify factors influencing long-term unrecovered nutritional status. Data were prospectively collected from 355 patients who underwent PD between 2008 and 2014. Nutritional status was evaluated by Mini Nutrition Assessment ( MNA) and patients were classified into group A ( malnourished) , group B ( risk-of-malnutrition) , or group C ( well-nourished). MNA score , complications , body mass index ( BMI) , stool<symptom> elastase level , biochemical parameters , and quality-of-life ( QOL) were collected serially for 1 year. Preoperatively , 60 patients were categorized into group A , 224 into group B , and 71 into group C. Overall complication and pancreatic fistula<disease> were higher in groups A and B compared with group C ( P = 0.003 vs P = 0.004). QOL , biochemical parameters , BMI and stool<symptom> elastase level were lowest in group A preoperatively. BMI and stool<symptom> elastase level remained low after surgery in all groups. Advanced age , low BMI , pre-existing diabetes mellitus , jaundice , exocrine insufficiency and adjuvant therapy were factors influencing long-term unrecovered nutritional status. Preoperative malnourished patients suffer from poor clinical outcomes. Therefore , those with risk factors of malnutrition should be monitored and vigorous efforts are needed to improve their nutrition.
