  Melittin ( MEL) is recognized as a highly potent therapeutic peptide for treating various<disease> human<disease> diseases<disease> including cancer. However , the clinical applications of MEL are largely restricted by its severe hemolytic activity and nonspecific cytotoxicity. Here , it is found that MEL can form a stable supramolecular nanocomplex of â‰ˆ 60 nm with the photosensitizer chlorin e6 ( Ce6) , which after hyaluronic acid ( HA) coating can achieve robust , safe , and imaging-guided tumor ablation. The as-designed nanocomplex ( denoted as MEL/Ce6 @HA) shows largely reduced hemolysis<symptom> and selective cytolytic activity toward cancer cells. Upon laser irradiation , the loaded photosensitive Ce6 can synergistically facilitate the membrane-lytic efficiency of melittin and greatly increase the tumor penetration depth of the complexes in multicellular tumor spheroids. In vivo experiments reveal that MEL/Ce6 @HA can realize enhanced tumor accumulation , reduced liver deposition , and rapid body clearance , which are beneficial for highly efficient and safe chemo-photodynamic dual therapy. This work develops a unique supramolecular strategy for optimized in vivo delivery of melittin and may have implications for the development of peptide-based theranostics.
