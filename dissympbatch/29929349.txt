  Neuropathic cancer pain ( NCP) is caused by nerve damage attributable to the cancer per se , and/or treatments including chemotherapy , radiotherapy , and surgery; the prevalence is reported to be as high as 40 %. The etiologies of NCP include direct nerve invasion or nerve compression by the cancer , neural toxicity , chemotherapy , and radiotherapy. NCP is subdivided into plexopathy , radiculopathy , and peripheral neuropathies , among several other categories. The clinical characteristics of NCP differ from those of nociceptive pain in terms of both the hypersensitivity<disease> symptoms ( burning , tingling , and an electrical sensation) and the hyposensitivity symptoms ( numbness and muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom>). Recovery requires several months to years , even after recovery from injury. Management is complex; NCP does not usually respond to opioids , although treatments may feature both opioids and adjuvant drugs including antidepressants , anticonvulsants , and anti-arrhythmic agents , all of which improve the quality-of-life. This review addresses the pathophysiology , clinical characteristics and management of NCP , and factors rendering pain control difficult.
