  Laminopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases with overlapping phenotypes that are caused by mutations in the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A and C. The most common group of laminopathies affects skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue , and is defined as LMNA-related myopathies ( LMNA-RM). In LMNA-RM patients , muscle histological findings are very variable , ranging from mild and unspecific changes to dystrophic features , sometimes with inflammatory evidence. As recently demonstrated in Duchenne muscular dystrophy , we wondered whether in LMNA-RM muscle tissue the genetic defect might determine the activation of an innate immune response , mainly mediated by Toll-like receptors ( TLRs) , leading to a chronic inflammation<symptom> and contributing to myofiber necrosis<symptom> and fibrosis<disease>. By qPCR , we found a significant up-regulation of TLR7 and TLR9 transcripts in LMNA-RM muscles compared to other myopathic and non-myopathic control muscles. By confocal microscopy we observed a marked TLR7/9 staining on LMNA-RM blood vessels and muscle fibers and , when present , on infiltrating cells. Characterization of TLR7/9 positive inflammatory cells showed a prevalence of CD68 positive macrophages , which were scattered in the tissue or localized close to degenerated muscle fibers and connective tissue deposits , with a minor presence of CD11c myeloid cells , and T lymphocytes. Our results recognize innate immunity as a player in LMNA-RM pathogenesis. Modulation of TLR7/9 signaling pathways and the decrease of macrophage-mediated inflammation<symptom> in LMNA-RM might to be considered as potential therapeutic strategies in LMNA-RM management.
