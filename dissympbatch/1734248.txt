  Acute pancreatitis<disease> is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas manifesting with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and elevated serum levels of pancreatic enzymes. Gallstones and chronic alcohol use are the most commonly described causes. A less studied cause is cholesterolosis , gallbladder polyps that cause mechanical obstruction of the sphincter of Oddi. Here , we present the case of a 55-year-old woman who presented with acute pancreatitis<disease> and was found to have cholesterol polyps in her gallbladder with no evidence of gallstones. The patient underwent cholecystectomy with complete resolution of her symptoms.
