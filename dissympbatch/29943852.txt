  Nummular eczema<disease> in children is a chronic condition characterized by pruritic coin-shaped eczematous lesions<symptom> that affect any part of the body and often become exudative. Mid- to high-potency topical corticosteroids are considered the mainstay treatment , but there are limited data on the use of systemic therapy for nummular eczema<disease> in children. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methotrexate in children with severe nummular eczema<disease>. A retrospective review was undertaken of children with nummular eczema<disease> treated with methotrexate between January 2007 and May 2017. The records of 28 patients ( 24 male , 4 female) with a mean age at the beginning of treatment of 7.8 ± 1.6 years ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 6.1-9.4 years) were reviewed. The median duration of treatment was 12.6 ± 3.3 months ( 95 % CI = 9.2-16 months) , and 14 patients were still undergoing methotrexate therapy at the time of last review. Ten patients ( 35.7 %) had complete or almost complete clearance of eczema<disease> ( > 90 % improvement) , 13 ( 46.4 %) had marked improvement ( 50 % -89 %) , four had mild improvement ( < 50 %) , and one failed methotrexate therapy. Gastrointestinal intolerance ( 21.4 %) and a nonsignificant increase in liver enzymes ( 17.9 %) were the most frequent side effects. No serious adverse events were noted. Methotrexate is an effective , well-tolerated treatment in children with moderate to severe nummular eczema<disease> that has failed to respond to conventional topical therapy.
