  Reduced mobility is a strong risk factor for pressure ulcer<disease> development in a nursing home setting. Despite this , there is a surprising lack of data regarding suitable nursing care beds in general and the prevention of pressure ulcers<disease> provided by lying surface systems in particular. In this context we aimed to assess the mobility of patients using lying surface systems either with spring elements ( SES) and to compare these to conventional systems ( CS; wooden slats or steel bars). This was a prospective , randomized , controlled study in 29 patients with an age range of 54-95 years. Patients were randomly assigned to SES ( n = 15) or CS ( n = 14). The primary objective was to show a statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients with normal ( up to 4 movements per hour) movements as evaluated by the Mobility Monitor We screened a total of 39 patients of which 29 were eligible to be randomized into the two groups and 27 were finally analysed ( SES = 14; CS = 13). The mean age was 81.7 ± 9.5 years , 81.5 % were female and the mean Braden Scale Score 22.4 ± 1.3. We observed no statistically significant difference in the primary evaluation criterion ( proportion of patients with a normal number of movements across 14 nights<symptom>) between the SES group ( 81.4 ± 10.8 %) and the CS group ( 72.9 ± 16.3 %; p = 0.0757). There was a consistent trend for more movements in the normal range in the SES group however , which was observed when the number of hours with normal movement was plotted per night ( p = 0.0004). Measured pressure values showed overall higher values for the lateral compared to the dorsal position with the SES but not the CS forming a `` shoulder '' between 35-55 mmHg in the dorsal position and between 35-45 mmHg in the lateral position. Self-rated comfort was significantly higher with the SES after night 14 ( p = 0.0192) than with CS. The study is not aimed at the hard endpoint pressure ulcer<disease> , but at the physiological<symptom> movement<symptom> profile of patients in bed , which justifies a much smaller number of cases. For elderly nursing home patients it appears that beds with spring elements may be associated with higher normality of body<symptom> movements<symptom> and higher self-rated comfort. The presented study could be a contribution to reduce the care dependency of patients regarding mobility.
