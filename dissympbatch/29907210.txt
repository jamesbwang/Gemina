  Nonoperative management ( NOM) of penetrating solid organ injuries ( SOI) has not been well described in the pediatric population. The objective of this study was to characterize the epidemiology , injury patterns , and factors associated with trial and failure of NOM. This is a retrospective cohort analysis of the National Trauma Data Bank for the period of 2007-2014. The study population included patients ≤ 18 y with penetrating injury to the liver , spleen , or kidney. NOM was defined as no operative intervention ( exploratory laparotomy or operation involving the liver , spleen , or kidney) < 4 h of emergency department arrival. Failed NOM was defined as operative intervention ≥ 4 h after emergency department arrival. Multivariate logistic regression explored clinical factors potentially associated with trial and failure of NOM. Of 943,000 pediatric trauma patients included in the National Trauma Data Bank , 3005 ( 0.32 %) met our inclusion criteria. Median age was 17.0 y; 88.8 % were male. Gunshot wounds<disease> ( GSW) accounted for 71.7 % of injury mechanisms and stab wounds<disease> accounted for the remaining 28.3 %. Median injury severity score was 9 ( interquartile range: 5-13). Two thousand one hundred and twenty-one ( 70.6 %) patients sustained kidney injury , 1210 ( 40.3 %) liver injury , and 159 ( 5.3 %) splenic injury. NOM was pursued in 615 ( 20.5 %) patients. Factors significantly associated with immediate operative intervention included GSW , hypotension<symptom> , and associated hollow viscus injury. Failed NOM was identified in 175 patients ( 28.5 %). Factors significantly associated with failed NOM included GSW , high-grade SOI , and associated hollow viscus injury. Overall mortality was 26 ( 0.9 %). NOM can be safe in a carefully selected group of pediatric patients with penetrating SOI. Future prospective studies are warranted to validate its feasibility.
