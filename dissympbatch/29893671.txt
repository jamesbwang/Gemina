  Whether coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG) should be performed on- or off-pump remains a matter of debate. We aim to present our experience with off-pump CABG. Early clinical outcome and adverse events were analyzed over the time course of the study. Methods: A total of 4310 patients undergoing isolated off- pump CABG from January 2002 until December 2016 at the Malabar Institute of Medical Sciences in India were included. Preoperative , intraoperative , and postoperative , as well as follow-up data were prospectively collected. To analyze the differences of patient characteristics and outcomes over time , five-year periods were created ( early: 2002-2006; middle: 2007-2011; late: 2012-2016). Traditional techniques of quality control monitoring were applied. Results: The mean age of our patients was 59 Â± 9 years , and 13 % ( 533) were female. Postoperative mortality was observed in 0.7 % ( 25) , acute<symptom> renal<symptom> failure<symptom> and stroke in 0.2 % ( 8) each , and mediastinitis<disease> in 1.2 % ( 53) of the patients. Despite the progressive worsening of the patient risk profile , significant improvement in mortality was observed over time , while stroke , acute<symptom> renal<symptom> failure<symptom> , and mediastinitis<disease> remained similar. Continuous quality control monitoring revealed that the system was within the control boundaries for the entire period of the study. The current probability of 30-day mortality or conversion to on-pump CABG is about 0.5 %. Conclusion: Off-pump CABG is safe and effective for patients undergoing CABG. It can provide superior results compared to on-pump CABG , particularly when performed by a dedicated off-pump surgeon.
