  Functional electrical stimulation is used to improve walking speed and reduces falls in people with upper motor neurone foot-drop. Following anecdotal observations of changes in bladder symptoms , an observational study was performed to explore this association further. A total of 47 consecutive patients attending for setup with functional electrical stimulation during a six-month period were asked to complete a questionnaire assessing bladder symptoms ( ICIQ-OAB ( International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Overactive Bladder)) at baseline and three months during routine appointments. In all , 35 ( 75 %) had multiple sclerosis and the other 12 subjects had a total of 9 diagnoses including 3 with stroke. Other conditions included cerebral palsy , motor neurone disease , hereditary spastic<disease> paraparesis<disease> , meningioma and spinocerebellar ataxias<symptom>. Improvement in overactive bladder symptoms was not significant in the whole cohort , however , was significant in patients with multiple sclerosis ( n = 35; mean change in ICIQ-OAB score 1.0 , P = 0.043). Specifically , significant improvements were seen in urgency and urge incontinence in multiple sclerosis patients. There was a significant negative correlation of moderate strength within the multiple sclerosis cohort between baseline walking speed and subsequent change in ICIQ-OAB score ( correlation coefficient of r = -0.40 , P = 0.046). Thus , greater changes in bladder symptoms were seen with lower baseline walking speeds. The results of this exploratory study suggest that functional electrical stimulation use does improve overactive bladder symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis. Further exploration is needed to study this association and explore whether the mechanism is similar to that of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation , a recognized treatment for the overactive bladder.
