  Tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) is one of the major public health problem among contagious diseases in Pakistan. TB diagnosis mainly depends on sputum<symptom> smear microscopy. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of household bleach on sputum<symptom> smear microscopy to concentrate acid fast bacilli for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis<disease>. Sputum<symptom> specimens of 200 suspected TB patients were collected for the study. Smears were prepared from the purulent part of sputum<symptom> sample before and after bleach treatment , heat fixed and stained with the ZN technique. The obtained data were analyzed by chi-squared test using SPSS software. Out of 200 isolates , 22 ( 11 %) patients had positive smears for acid fast bacilli ( AFB) by direct ZN staining. After treatment with household bleach ( NaOCL) and centrifugation , the number of AFB positive patients were increased from 22 ( 11 %) to 37 ( 18.5 %). The bleach-concentration method for sputum<symptom> samples significantly increased the TB detection rate as compared to direct sputum<symptom> smear microscopy. Thus , a shift from direct sputum<symptom> microscopy to bleach-concentration technique should be considered a better method for detection of AFB in sputum<symptom> through smear microscopy.
