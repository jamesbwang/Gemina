  Acute pancreatitis<disease> ( AP) is a common acute abdominal disease accompanied by systemic inflammatory response syndrome<disease> , and could even be complicated by multiple-organ damage. This study aimed to examine whether calycosin , an isoflavone isolated from Radix astragali with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity , could protect against AP induced by cerulein. To this end , Balb/C mice were injected with cerulein ( 50 μg/kg) to establish the animal model of AP. Calycosin ( 25 and 50 mg/kg , p.o.) was administered 1 h prior to the first cerulein injection. After the last injection of cerulein , the mice were sacrificed and blood was obtained for cytokine analysis. The pancreas was removed for morphological examination , myeloperoxidase ( MPO) and malondialdehyde ( MDA) analyses , immunohistochemistry , and western blot analysis. Calycosin treatment reversed the increased serum levels of amylase and lipase , alleviated the pathological damage in the pancreas , and decreased the levels of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α , interleukin ( IL) -6 , and IL-1β in mice with AP. Additionally , calycosin significantly reduced cerulein-induced pancreatic edema<symptom> , inhibited MPO activity and increased superoxide dismutase ( SOD) activity , and inhibited the expression of NF-κB/p65 and phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-κB ( IκBα) and p38 MAPK. These results suggested that calycosin protects against AP by exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects via the p38 MAPK and NF-κB signal pathways. Calycosin 's benefits for AP patients need to be explored further.
