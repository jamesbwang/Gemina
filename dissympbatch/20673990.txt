  Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) are emerging as powerful regulators of adipocyte differentiation and gene expression. However , their significance in adipose tissue metabolism and physiology has not been demonstrated in vivo. We previously identified Blnc1 as a conserved lncRNA regulator of brown and beige adipocyte differentiation. In this study , we investigated the physiological role of Blnc1 in thermogenesis , adipose remodeling and systemic metabolism. We generated fat-specific Blnc1 transgenic and conditional knockout mouse strains and investigated how adipocyte Blnc1 levels are causally linked to key aspects of metabolic health following diet-induced obesity. We performed studies using cultured adipocytes to establish cell-autonomous role of Blnc1 in regulating adipocyte gene programs. Blnc1 is highly induced in both brown and white fats from obese mice. Fat-specific inactivation of Blnc1 impairs cold-induced thermogenesis and browning and exacerbates obesity-associated brown fat whitening , adipose tissue inflammation<symptom> and fibrosis<disease> , leading to more severe insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. On the contrary , transgenic expression of Blnc1 in adipose tissue elicits the opposite and beneficial metabolic effects , supporting a critical role of Blnc1 in driving adipose adaptation and homeostatic remodeling during obesity. Mechanistically , Blnc1 cell-autonomously attenuates proinflammatory cytokine signaling and promotes fuel storage in adipocytes through its protein partner Zbtb7b. This study illustrates a surprisingly pleiotropic and dominant role of lncRNA in driving adaptive adipose tissue remodeling and preserving metabolic health.
