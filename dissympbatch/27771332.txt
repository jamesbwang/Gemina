  Variants in the lipoprotein lipase ( LPL) , apolipoprotein C-II ( APOC2) , apolipoprotein A-V ( APOA5) , GPIHBP1 and LMF1 genes may cause severe hypertriglyceridemia ( HTG) , which is now the second-leading aetiology of acute pancreatitis<disease> in China. The patient and his family were assessed for gene variants by Sanger sequencing of exons and exon-intron junctions of the LPL , GPIHBP1 , APOA5 , APOC2 , and LMF1 genes. Post-heparin blood was collected for LPL mass and activity detection. The patient had suffered from long-term severe hypertriglyceridemia and recurrent abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> for over 30 years , since age 26 , and 3 bouts of acute pancreatitis<disease> Two heterozygous LPL single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) were compound but dislinked: a single-nucleotide substitution ( c. 42G > A) resulting in the substitution of tryptophan with a stop codon ( p.W14X) in one allele , and a single-nucleotide substitution ( c. 835C > G) resulting in a leucine-to-valine substitution ( p.L279 V) in another allele. Only one SNP , p.L279 V , was detected in his son. Post-heparin LPL activity and mass were also lower in the patient. Two heterozygous LPL SNPs , W14X and L279 V , were newly found to be compound but dislinked , which may cause long-term severe hypertriglyceridemia and recurrent acute
