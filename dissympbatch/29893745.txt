  Pain signals are transmitted by multisynaptic glutamatergic pathways. Their first synapse between primary nociceptors and excitatory spinal interneurons gates the sensory load. In this pathway , glutamate release is orchestrated by Ca2 +- sensor proteins , with N-terminal EF-hand Ca2 +- binding protein 2 ( NECAB2) being particular abundant. However , neither the importance of NECAB2 + neuronal contingents in dorsal root ganglia ( DRGs) and spinal cord nor the function determination by NECAB2 has been defined. A combination of histochemical analyses and single-cell RNA-sequencing showed NECAB2 in small- and medium-sized C- and Aδ D-hair low-threshold mechanoreceptors in DRGs , as well as in protein kinase C γ excitatory spinal interneurons. NECAB2 was downregulated by peripheral nerve injury , leading to the hypothesis that NECAB2 loss of function could limit pain sensation<symptom>. Indeed , Necab2-/- mice reached a pain-free state significantly faster after peripheral inflammation<symptom> than did WT littermates. Genetic access to transiently activated neurons revealed that a mediodorsal cohort of NECAB2 + neurons mediates inflammatory<symptom> pain<symptom> in the mouse spinal dorsal horn. Here , besides dampening excitatory transmission in spinal interneurons , NECAB2 limited pronociceptive brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) release from sensory afferents. Hoxb8-dependent reinstatement of NECAB2 expression in Necab2-/- mice then demonstrated that spinal and DRG NECAB2 alone could control inflammation-induced sensory hypersensitivity<disease>. Overall , we identify NECAB2 as a critical component of pronociceptive pain signaling , whose inactivation offers substantial pain relief.
