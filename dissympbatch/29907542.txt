  In the past few months , 2 main streams of research have dominated the panorama of myelodysplastic syndrome<disease> ( MDS) investigations: deepening the insight into the pathogenic role , hierarchy , and prognostic effect of somatic mutations and , as a consequence , into the effect of inherited congenital predisposing conditions and the second , quite interlinked with the first , analyzing inflammation<symptom> and innate immunity in patients with MDS. The research devoted to clarifying the mechanisms of action and mechanisms of resistance to hypomethylating agents has also advanced , mostly resulting from different approaches to the study of DNA methylation. Recent observations have reinforced support for targeted therapies for selected subgroups of MDS patients.
