  Parathyroid glands are the main regulator of body mineral metabolism through parathormone ( PTH) actions on bone and kidney. Experimental evidence suggests that PTH may have non-classical target organs such as adipose tissue , arterial vascular wall , cardiac muscle cells , and adrenal cortex cells , where it may play a role in controlling body energy , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and metabolism. Cardiometabolic features have been investigated in the wide spectrum of clinical parathyroid disorders , from hyperparathyroidism to pseudohypoparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. Indeed , in parathyroid disorders , besides altered PTH secretion , impaired serum calcium levels and vitamin D status occur. Both calcium and vitamin D have been shown to regulate metabolism and to be associated with cardiovascular diseases. However , despite the complexity of parathyroid disorders , features of metabolic syndrome<disease> , such as obesity , insulin resistance , and glucose intolerance , arterial blood hypertension , and dyslipidemia , are frequently diagnosed in primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism as well as in pseudohyperparathyroidism. Here , we reviewed the most consistent data highlighting challenges and providing clinical remarks.
