  Diabetic retinopathy ( DR) is a multifactorial manifestation associated with microvascular complications and is the fourth leading cause of visual impairment and blindness<symptom> world-wide. Current day treatment of DR relies heavily on invasive techniques such as intravitreal injections of therapeutic agents. Unfortunately , intravitreal injections are associated with various complications such as intraocular bleeding , endophthalmitis<disease> , pain and discomfort resulting in poor patient compliance. To date , there has been no non-invasive drug delivery system reported for DR treatment. To address this , we developed a core-shell nanoparticle-based delivery system consisting of a hydrophobic polycaprolactone core and a hydrophilic Pluronic ® F68 shell , loaded with triamcinolone acetonide and evaluated its efficacy in a DR rat model. After being administered as eye drops , the drug loaded nanoparticles significantly improved structural ( retinal thickness and vascular health) and functional activity ( rod and cone function) of retina as compared to DR controls that were treated with the drug alone or placebo nanoparticles. Furthermore , drug loaded nanoparticles reduced retinal inflammation<symptom> as evidenced by a decrease in NF-κB , ICAM-1 and TNFα expression after 20 days of treatment. Similarly , a reduction in glial cell hyperplasia<disease> as evidenced by reduced GFAP expression , and a decrease in microvascular complications as evidenced by a decrease in VEGF secretion and microvascular tuft formation were observed in rat retinas after 40 days of treatment. The combined reduction in retinal inflammation<symptom> and vascular abnormalities , both hallmarks of DR , demonstrates the potential of the nanoparticulate delivery system for use as a topical formulation for treating DR.
