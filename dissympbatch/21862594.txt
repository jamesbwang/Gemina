  Effective therapeutic approaches are urgently required to tackle the alarmingly poor survival outcomes in esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC) patients. EAC originates from within the intestinal-type metaplasia , Barrett 's esophagus , a condition arising on a background of gastroesophageal reflux disease and associated inflammation<symptom>. This study used a druggable genome small interfering RNA ( siRNA) screening library of 6022 siRNAs in conjunction with bioinformatics platforms , genomic studies of EAC tissues , somatic variation data of EAC from The Cancer Genome Atlas data of EAC , and pathologic and functional studies to define novel EAC-associated , and targetable , immune factors. By using a druggable genome library we defined genes that sustain EAC cell growth , which included an unexpected immunologic signature. Integrating Cancer Genome Atlas data with druggable siRNA targets showed a striking concordance and an EAC-specific gene amplification event associated with 7 druggable targets co-encoded at Chr6p21 .1. Over-representation of immune pathway-associated genes supporting EAC cell growth included leukemia<disease> inhibitory factor , complement component 1 , q subcomponent A chain ( C1QA) , and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 ( TREM2) , which were validated further as targets sharing downstream signaling pathways through genomic and pathologic studies. Finally , targeting the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2- , C1q- , and leukemia<disease> inhibitory factor-activated signaling pathways ( TYROBP-spleen tyrosine kinase and JAK-STAT3) with spleen tyrosine kinase and Janus-activated kinase inhibitor fostamatinib R788 triggered EAC cell death , growth arrest , and reduced tumor burden in NOD scid gamma mice. These data highlight a subset of genes co-identified through siRNA targeting and genomic studies of expression and somatic variation , specifically highlighting the contribution that immune-related factors play in support of EAC development and suggesting their suitability as targets in the treatment of EAC.
