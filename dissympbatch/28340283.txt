  Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH) is a rare complication of dasatinib that was approved as a first-line therapy for chronic myelocytic leukemia<disease> ( CML). A 24-year-old man presenting dyspnea<symptom> at rest and leg<symptom> edema<symptom> was admitted to our hospital. He had been diagnosed with CML and prescribed dasatinib for 4 years. Chest X-ray showed significant bilateral pleural effusion<symptom> and heart<symptom> enlargement<symptom>. Echocardiography revealed interventricular septal compression and elevated peak tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient of 66.7 mmHg indicating severe pulmonary hypertension. After the other specific diseases to provoke PAH were excluded , he was diagnosed with dasatinib-induced PAH. Despite discontinuation of dasatinib and intravenous administration of diuretic for two weeks , World Health Organization ( WHO) functional class was still II and mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( PAP) was high at 37 mmHg. Therefore , we administered sildenafil and bosentan together as an upfront combination therapy three weeks after dasatinib discontinuation. Six months later , his symptoms improved to WHO functional class I and mean PAP was decreased to 31 mmHg. Although PAH is a rare complication of dasatinib , symptomatic patients prescribed with dasatinib should have an echocardiogram for PAH screening. Moreover , the upfront combination therapy would be a useful option for symptomatic patients after discontinuation of dasatinib.
