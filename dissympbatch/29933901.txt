  Gamma-hydroxybutyrate ( GHB) is a synthetic drug used mainly for recreational purpose. Although the prevalence of GHB abuse is low in Taiwan , GHB has become increasingly popular in certain subpopulations such as clubbers and men who have sex with men ( MSM). GHB dependence could be associated with severe withdrawal syndrome<disease> including hallucinations and delirium<symptom>. Despite systematic studies on detoxification and management of GHB withdrawal have been performed , no validated measurement for severity of GHB withdrawal syndrome<disease> is available. Here we present a case of GHB withdrawal delirium<symptom> that was treated successfully with fixed and symptom-triggered benzodiazepine dosing regimen based on Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised ( CIWA-Ar) scale. The utilization of CIWA-Ar in such cases could offer useful guidance for benzodiazepine dosing. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first case report of GHB withdrawal delirium<symptom> in Taiwan.
