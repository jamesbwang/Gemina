  Post-pancreatitis diabetes mellitus ( PPDM) is a sub-type of diabetes of the exocrine pancreas that develops after acute or chronic inflammation<symptom> of the pancreas. While pro-inflammatory mileu , glucose metabolism , and lipid metabolism in PPDM have been investigated , little is known about gastrointestinal function in post-pancreatitis setting. This article overviews studies on epidemiology and impact of gastroparesis in the setting of type 1 and type 2 diabetes , with a view to estimating the possible burden of gastrointestinal dysfunction in PPDM. Further , the usefulness of quantifying gastrointestinal dysmotility is discussed. The gastroparesis cardinal symptom index has emerged as a standardised gastrointestinal dysmotility endpoint and its use in individuals after pancreatitis<disease> is justified.
