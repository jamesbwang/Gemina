  The management of hydrocephalus<symptom> represents a neurosurgical challenge. Ventriculoperitoneal ( VP) shunts are usually the treatment of choice for hydrocephalus<symptom>. However , when VP shunt is not an option , ventriculoatrial ( VA) shunt becomes a second choice. VA shunts have special complications such as postoperative neck hematomas , shunt nephritis , and migration of the distal segment. There are two main techniques for the retrieval of migrated VA shunt: either by retrieval of the broken segment by thoracotomy , which is highly invasive , or by transvenous approach. A 9-year-old boy presented with severe cerebral palsy , who was VP shunt dependent since birth. The patient developed generalized cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) ascites with peritonitis<disease> The shunt was externalized and infection was treated with intravenous antibiotics. Two weeks later , and due to previous multiple abdominal procedures , it was decided to go for VA shunt and the procedure went well without complications. One month later , the patient presented to emergency department with neck swelling; shunt x-ray showed shunt breakage at clavicular level and the tip of the shunt was dislodged into the pulmonary artery. Under general anesthesia and after getting informed consent , through femoral vein , VA shunt was retrieved successfully without complications and new VP shunt was inserted. Migration of the distal segment of a broken atrial catheter is rare , but has a significant complication and is major cause of mortality. Endovascular retrieval of migrated shunts is less invasive , is feasible , and prevents further complications. There has been similar case in the adult English literature; however , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first reported case in the English literature of a successful endovascular retrieval of migrated dislodged VA shunt in pediatrics.
