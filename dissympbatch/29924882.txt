  A reduction in trabecular bone mass is often associated with an increase in marrow fat in osteoporotic bones. The molecular mechanisms underlying this inverse correlation are incompletely understood. Here , we report that mice lacking tuberous sclerosis 1 ( Tsc1) in Osterix-expressing cells had a significant decrease in trabecular bone mass characterized by decreased osteoblastogenesis , increased osteoclastogenesis , and increased bone<disease> marrow adiposity in vivo. In vitro study showed that Tsc1-deficient bone<disease> marrow stromal cells ( BMSCs) had decreased proliferation , decreased osteogenic differentiation , and increased adipogenic differentiation in association with the downregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Mechanistically , TSC1 deficiency led to autophagy suppression and consequent Notch1 protein increase , which mediated the GSK3β-independent β-catenin degradation. Together , our results indicate that Tsc1 controls the balance<symptom> between osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation of BMSCs. © 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
