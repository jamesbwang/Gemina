  Pain occurs with optic neuropathies associated with inflammatory central nervous system diseases ( MS and NMO) , idiopathic intracranial hypertension and spontaneous hypotension<symptom> , giant cell arteritis , immunomediated systemic<disease> diseases<disease> , compressive lesions<symptom> , or infective disorders. Pain can precede the onset of visual loss in acute optic neuritis , it can be irradiated to the orbital region in giant cell arteritis and parasellar compressive optic neuropathies , or it may be located to the back of the eye with posterior scleritis. History of symptoms together with complete neuro-ophthalmological examination must guide the differential diagnosis and neuroimaging. Painful visual loss due to different pathophysiological mechanisms requires specific treatment and prognosis.
