  An F-FDG PET/CT was performed on a 43-year-old woman with photosensitive skin<symptom> rash<symptom> , abnormal liver function , and pancytopenia , which demonstrated prominent hepatomegaly , splenomegaly<symptom> , and diffuse liver F-FDG avidity.

X-linked erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthase gene analysis proved the diagnosis of X-linked protoporphyria.
