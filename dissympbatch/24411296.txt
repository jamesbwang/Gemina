  Metastasis of non-gynaecological tumours to the cervix is a rare event , and metastasis from breast cancer is even rarer , with only a limited number of such cases reported in the literature to date. We herein report the case of an 86-year-old female patient who had undergone mastectomy and axillary lymphadenectomy for invasive ductal cell breast carcinoma 2 years prior , followed by adjuvant hormonal therapy with letrozole. During hospitalization for anemia<symptom> associated with an inflammatory syndrome<disease> and abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> with menorrhagia<symptom> , an abdominal ultrasound examination revealed a suspicious uterine mass with irregular contours and abnormal vascularization with associated increase of the blood level of cancer antigen 15-3 to 34 kU/l. The histological and immunohistochemical analysis of a cervical biopsy sample discover a secondary lesion<symptom> metastatic from the primary ductal cell breast carcinoma. The metastatic tissue was hormone-negative , which was compatible with disease progression during hormonal therapy. Considering the multiple metastasis , comorbidities , unfavourable performance status and the quick deterioration of the patient 's clinical condition , only best supportive care was administered.
