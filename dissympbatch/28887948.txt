  γδ T lymphocytes maintain skin homeostasis by balancing keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation with the destruction of infected or malignant cells. An imbalance in skin-resident T cell function can aggravate skin-related autoimmune diseases , impede tumor eradication , or disrupt proper wound<disease> healing. Much of the published work on human skin T cells attributes T cell function in the skin<symptom> to αβ T cells , while γδ T cells are an often overlooked participant. This review details the roles played by both αβ and γδ T cells in healthy human skin and then focuses on their roles in skin diseases , such as psoriasis and alopecia areata. Understanding the contribution of skin-resident and skin-infiltrating T cell populations and cross-talk with other immune cells is leading to the development of novel therapeutics for patients. However , there is still much to be learned in order to effectively modulate T cell function and maintain healthy skin homeostasis.
