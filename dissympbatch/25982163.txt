  The traditional fear that every case of acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> will eventually perforate has led to the generally accepted emergency appendicectomy with minimized delay. However , emergency and thereby sometimes night-time surgery is associated with several drawbacks , whereas the consequences of surgery after limited delay are unclear. This systematic review aimed to assess in-hospital delay before surgery as risk factor for complicated appendicitis<disease> and postoperative morbidity in patients with acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease>. PubMed and EMBASE were searched from 1990 to 2016 for studies including patients who underwent appendicectomy for acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> , reported in two or more predefined time intervals. The primary outcome measure was complicated appendicitis<disease> after surgery ( perforated or gangrenous appendicitis<disease> other outcomes were postoperative surgical-site infection and morbidity. Adjusted odds ratios ( ORs) were pooled using forest<disease> plots if possible. Unadjusted data were pooled using generalized linear mixed models. Forty-five studies with 152 314 patients were included. Pooled adjusted ORs revealed no significantly higher risk for complicated appendicitis<disease> when appendicectomy was delayed for 7-12 or 13-24 h ( OR 1 · 07 , 95 per cent c.i. 0 · 98 to 1 · 17 , and OR 1 · 09 , 0 · 95 to 1 · 24 , respectively). Meta-analysis of unadjusted data supported these findings by yielding no increased risk for complicated appendicitis<disease> or postoperative complications with a delay of 24-48 h. This meta-analysis demonstrates that delaying appendicectomy for presumed uncomplicated appendicitis<disease> for up to 24 h after admission does not appear to be a risk factor for complicated appendicitis<disease> , postoperative surgical-site infection or morbidity. Delaying appendicectomy for up to 24 h may be an acceptable alternative for patients with no preoperative signs of complicated
