  Serum IL-22 levels are increased in patients with atopic dermatitis<disease> , which commonly precedes asthma in the atopic march. Epicutaneous sensitization in mice results in T We sought to determine the role of IL-22 in antigen-driven airway allergic inflammation<symptom> after inhalation challenge in epicutaneously sensitized mice. Wild-type ( WT) and Il22 Epicutaneous sensitization preferentially elicited an IL-22 response compared with intraperitoneal immunization. Intranasal challenge of mice epicutaneously sensitized with OVA elicited in the lungs Il22 mRNA expression , IL-22 production , and accumulation of CD3 Epicutaneous sensitization promotes generation of antigen-specific IL-22-producing T cells that promote airway inflammation<symptom> and AHR after antigen challenge , suggesting that IL-22 plays an important role in the atopic march.
