  Biologicals targeting the interleukin ( IL) -1 β or IL-6 pathway are becoming prime choices for the treatment of children with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis<disease> ( sJIA). Up to 1 in 3 sJIA children receiving such treatment continues to have inflammatory activity and to require supra-physiological glucocorticoid doses which may reduce growth velocity for years and may lead to an extremely short stature for age , if not for life. Currently , there is no long-term proposal to normalize the adult height of these children with sJIA. We present long-term ( up to 10 years) , proof-of-concept evidence that the adult stature and adipose body composition of short sJIA children can be normalized with a hormonal combination strategy: ( i) pubertal onset is postponed with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog ( triptorelin) until a minimum height is reached , or until prepubertal growth is exhausted , and ( ii) height gain is promoted with growth hormone ( ≈ 50 μg/kg/day) , once inflammation<symptom> is under control and high glucocorticoid doses are no longer needed. The latter treatment takes advantage of the window of relative glucocorticoid deficiency , which is known to open after prolonged glucocorticoid administration , and to be uniquely favorable to height gain. A long-term combination of biological and hormonal treatments for short sJIA children can be guided by a simple concept that involves ( i) postponement of pubertal development and ( ii) growth-promoting therapy after the episodes of major inflammation<symptom> and high-dose glucocorticoid treatment. Limited long-term experience in short sJIA children suggests that this strategy leads consistently- albeit late- to a normal adult stature.
