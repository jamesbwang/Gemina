  Clinical gingival inflammation<symptom> is a well-defined site-specific condition for which several measurement systems have been proposed and validated , and epidemiological studies consistently indicate its high prevalence globally. However , it is clear that defining and grading a gingival inflammatory condition at a site level ( i.e. a `` gingivitis<disease> site '') is completely different from defining and grading a `` gingivitis<disease> case '' ( GC) ( i.e. a patient affected by gingivitis<disease> , and that a `` gingivitis<disease> site '' does not necessarily mean a `` GC ''. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the evidence on clinical , biochemical , microbiologic , genetic markers as well as symptoms associated with plaque-induced gingivitis<disease> and to propose a set of criteria to define GC. A universally accepted case definition for gingivitis<disease> would provide the necessary information to enable oral health professionals to assess the effectiveness of their prevention strategies and treatment regimens; help set priorities for therapeutic actions/programs by health care providers; and undertake surveillance. Based on available methods to assess gingival inflammation<symptom> , GC could be simply , objectively and accurately identified and graded using bleeding on probing score ( BOP %) CONCLUSIONS: A patient with intact periodontium would be diagnosed as a GC according to a BOP score ≥ 10 % , further classified as localized ( BOP score ≥ 10 % and ≤ 30 %) or generalized ( BOP score > 30 %). The proposed classification may also apply to patients with a reduced periodontium , where a GC would characterize a patient with attachment loss and BOP score ≥ 10 % , but without BOP in any site probing ≥ 4 mm in depth.
