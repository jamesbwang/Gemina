  Respiratory exposure to multiwalled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNT) or asbestos results in fibrosis<disease>; however , the mechanisms to reach this end point may be different. A previous study by our group identified pulmonary effects and significantly altered messenger RNA ( mRNA) signaling pathways following exposure to 1 , 10 , 40 , and 80 µg MWCNT and 120 µg crocidolite asbestos on mouse lungs over time at 1-month , 6-month , and 1-year postexposure following pulmonary aspiration. As a continuation to the above study , this current study took an in-depth look at the signaling pathways involved in fibrosis<disease> development at a single time point , 1 year , and exposure , 40 µg MWCNT , the lowest exposure at which fibrosis<disease> was pathologically evident. The 120 µg asbestos exposure was included to compare MWCNT-induced fibrosis<disease> with asbestos-induced fibrosis<disease>. A previously validated computational model was used to identify mRNAs with expression profiles matching the fibrosis<disease> pathology patterns from exposed mouse lungs. mRNAs that matched the pathology patterns were then input into ingenuity pathway analysis to determine potential signaling pathways and physiological disease functions inherent to MWCNT and asbestos exposure. Both MWCNT and asbestos exposure induced changes in mouse lungs regarding gene expression , cell proliferation , and survival , while MWCNT uniquely induced alterations in pathways involved in oxidative phosphorylation , mitochondrial dysfunction , and transcription. Asbestos exposure produced unique alterations in pathways involved in sustained inflammation<symptom>. Although typically considered similar due to scale and fiber-like appearance , the different compositional properties inherent to either MWCNT or asbestos may play a role in their ability to induce fibrosis<disease> after pulmonary exposure.
