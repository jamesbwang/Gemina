  Hemorrhagic shock<symptom> is the second leading cause of death in blunt trauma and a significant cause of mortality in non-trauma patients. The increased use of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta ( REBOA) as a bridge to definitive control for massive hemorrhage<symptom> has provided promising results in the trauma population. We describe an extension of this procedure to our hemodynamically unstable non-trauma patients. This is a retrospective review of patients requiring REBOA for end stage non-traumatic abdominal<symptom> hemorrhage<symptom> from our tertiary care facility. After excluding patients with trauma , supradiaphragmatic bleed and thoracic/abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysms<disease> , demographics , etiology of bleed , REBOA placement specifics , complications and outcomes were reviewed. From August 2013 to August 2016 , 11 patients were identified requiring REBOA placement for hemodynamic<symptom> instability<symptom> from non-traumatic abdominal<symptom> hemorrhage<symptom>. Average patient age was 54.9 ( SD 15.2). Sixty-four percent suffered cardiac arrest prior to REBOA , with mean shock<symptom> index of 1.29. Average time from diagnosis of shock<symptom> ( MAP â‰¤ 65) or signs of bleeding to placement of REBOA was 177 min. The leading etiologies of hemorrhage<symptom> were ruptured visceral aneurysm<disease> and massive upper gastrointestinal bleed. REBOA was placed by both acute care and vascular surgeons. The procedure was mainly completed in the operating room in 82 % of the patients and at the bedside in 18 %. One patient expired before operative repair. Definitive surgical control of the source of bleeding was obtained by open surgical approach ( n = 6) and combined surgical and endovascular approach ( n = 4). In-hospital survival was 64 %. There were no local complications related to REBOA placement. Similar to the trauma population , REBOA is an adjunctive technique for proximal control of bleeding as well as resuscitation in end stage non-traumatic intra-abdominal hemorrhage<symptom>. We propose an algorithmic approach to REBOA use in this population and a larger prospective review is necessary to determine both the timing of REBOA placement and which non-traumatic patients may benefit from this technique.
