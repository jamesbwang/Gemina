  To evaluate relationships between psychiatric symptoms , acceptance , and migraine-related disability in a sample of people with migraine presenting at a tertiary care headache<symptom> center. Migraine is a chronic<disease> disease<disease> that can be severely disabling. Despite a strong theoretical basis and evidence in other pain conditions , little is known about relationships between acceptance , psychiatric symptoms , and migraine-related disability. Ninety patients with physician-diagnosed migraine completed surveys assessing demographics , headache<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , severe migraine-related disability ( Migraine Disability Assessment Scale total score dichotomized at â‰¥ 21) , depression<symptom> ( Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and anxiety<symptom> symptoms ( Generalized Anxiety<symptom> Disorder-7) , and acceptance ( Chronic<symptom> Pain<symptom> Acceptance Questionnaire; subscales: Pain Willingness and Activity Engagement). Participants ( 77.8 % white , non-Hispanic; 85.6 % women; and 50.0 % with a graduate level education) reported an average headache<symptom> pain<symptom> intensity of 6.7/ 10 ( SD = 2.0). One-third ( 36.0 %) reported chronic migraine , and half ( 51.5 %) reported severe migraine-related disability. Lower acceptance was associated with severe migraine-related disability , t ( 54) = 4.13 , P < .001. Higher activity engagement was associated with lower average headache<symptom> pain<symptom> intensity ( r = -.30 , P = .011). Higher acceptance was associated with lower levels of depression<symptom> ( r = -.48 , P < .001) and anxiety<symptom> symptoms ( r = -.37 , P = .003). Pain willingness and activity engagement serially mediated relationships between depression<symptom> symptoms and severe migraine-related disability ( indirect effect = 0.05 , 95 % CI = 0.01 , 0.15) , and between anxiety<symptom> symptoms and severe migraine-related disability ( indirect effect = 0.12 , 95 % CI = 0.02 , 0.31). Results provided preliminary support for a theoretical pathway by which psychiatric symptoms may influence migraine-related disability , in part , through their relationships with pain willingness and activity engagement.
