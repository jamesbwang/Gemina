  Current medicine and medical science puts great effort into elucidating the basis of chronicity and finding appropriate treatments for inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>; however , the mechanisms driving aberrant immune responses are mostly unknown and deserve further study. Of particular interest is the identification of checkpoints that regulate the function and differentiation of pro-inflammatory cells during pathogenesis , along with means of their modulation for therapeutic purposes. Natural killer group 2 , member D ( NKG2D) is a potent activator of the immune system , known as a sensor for `` induced-self '' ligands , i.e. , cellular danger signals that , in the context of chronic inflammation<symptom> and autoimmunity , can be presented by cells being exposed to an inflammatory cytokine milieu , endoplasmic reticulum stress , or cell death. Engagement by such ligands can be translated by NKG2D into activation or co-stimulation of NK cells and different subsets of T cells , respectively , thus contributing to the regulation of the inflammatory response. In this review , we discuss the current knowledge on the contribution of the NKG2D-NKG2DL signaling axis during intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> , type 1 diabetes , multiple sclerosis , and rheumatoid arthritis<disease> , where the role of NKG2D has been associated either by aberrant expression of the receptor and its ligands and/or by functional data in corresponding mouse models.
