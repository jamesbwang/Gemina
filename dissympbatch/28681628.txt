  Fibromyalgia Syndrome<disease> ( FMS) is a condition considered to represent a prototype of central sensitization syndrome<disease> , characterized by chronic widespread pain and along with symptoms of fatigue<symptom> , non-restorative sleep and cognitive difficulties. FMS can be induced by trauma , infection or emotional stress with cumulative evidence that dissociation is relatively frequent in FMS patients. Two randomized controlled trials have shown that hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBOT) can induce neuroplasticity and be effective in patients suffering from FMS. In this paper we present , for the first time , case series of female fibromyalgia patients who , in the course of HBOT , suddenly recalled repressed traumatic memories of childhood sexual abuse ( CSA). The surfacing of the repressed ( dissociative) memories decades after the sexual abuse events was sudden and utterly surprising. No psychological intervention was involved. As the memories surfaced , the physical pain related to FMS subsided. In one patient who had brain single photon emission CT ( SPECT) before and after HBOT , the prefrontal cortex appeared suppressed before and reactivated after. The 3 cases reported in this article are representative of a total of nine fibromyalgia patients who experienced a retrieval of repressed memory during HBOT. These cases provide insights on dissociative amnesia and suggested mechanism hypothesis that is further discussed in the article. Obviously , prospective studies can not be planned since patients are not aware of their repressed memories. However , it is very important to keep in mind the possibility of surfacing memories when treating fibromyalgia patients with HBOT or other interventions capable of awakening dormant brain regions.
