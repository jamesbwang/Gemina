  Corticosteroid-dependent dermatitis<disease> ( CDD) is an inflammation<symptom> caused by long-term repeated inappropriate external use of corticosteroids. Tripterine is a natural product from the root of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook.f. This study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of tripterine on LPS-induced inflammatory injury in HaCaT cells. In this study , different concentrations ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 μM) of tripterine and 10 μM of LPS were used to treat HaCaT cells. The expression of miR-146a was altered by transfection. Cell viability , apoptosis , and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-6 and TNF-α) were detected by CCK-8 , flow cytometry analysis , qRT-PCR and ELISA , respectively. The expression levels of apoptosis-related and JNK/ NF-κB-related proteins were tested by western blotting. We found that 3 and 4 μM of tripterine significantly decreased cell viability. Tripterine alleviated LPS-induced reduction of cell viability , increase of apoptosis and the release of IL-6 and TNF-α in HaCaT cells. miR-146a was down-regulated by LPS exposure , while tripterine attenuated this impact. Further , inhibition of miR-146a abolished the protective effect of tripterine on cell damage triggered by LPS. Finally , tripterine deactivated JNK and NF-κB pathways through up-regulation of miR-146a. These results demonstrated that tripterine could attenuate LPS-induced inflammatory injury and deactivate JNK and NF-κB pathways by up-regulation of miR-146a. This study will provide a theoretical basis for further study of tripterine in CDD.
