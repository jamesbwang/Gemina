  ureteral stump syndrome<disease> is defined as a recurrent urinary<disease> infection<disease> , low<symptom> abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and haematuria in patients with a history of nephrectomy. Its incidence is low and the symptoms are non-specific. The aim of our paper was to present our results with endoscopic treatment of symptomatic ureteral remnants. We performed a retrospective study of patients with ureteral remnant syndrome<disease> after nephrectomy treated in our centre between 2004 and 2015. We present a series of 10 patients. The patients were treated endoscopically with electrofulguration of the ureter and edges of the affected meatus , with subsequent injection of filler material into the suburetheral submucosa to aid in the coaptation of the ureteral remnant walls. The mean age at treatment was 2 years. The right ureteral remnant was treated in 6 patients and the left in 4. Seven meatuses were ectopic and 3 orthotopic. Follow-up was 8 years. After endoscopic treatment only 2patients relapsed. Endourological treatment of ureteral stump syndrome<disease> is a simple , safe , rapid and effective option that can be performed as an outpatient , for orthotopic and ectopic stumps. It does not compromise subsequent open resection of the ureteral remnant if required , and therefore we believe that it should be considered a valid alternative for the initial treatment of this disorder.
