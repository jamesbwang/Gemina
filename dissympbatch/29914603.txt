  Depression<symptom> is likely to be a factor in the low global rates of successful treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis<disease> ( MDR-TB) due to poor adherence to treatment. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of depression<symptom> among patients being treated for MDR-TB in Pakistan , explore rates of depression<symptom> over the course of treatment and identify risk factors for depression<symptom> This cross-sectional study analysed health care service data from 12 treatment sites following a single screening event using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 ( PHQ-9). Logistic regression models were used to identify associations. Data were collected from 1279 patients with MDR-TB. The proportion of MDR-TB patients with depression<symptom> was 42.8 % ( 95 % CI 40.1-45.5). Rates of depression<symptom> varied according to duration of treatment , with the highest proportion ( 53.2 %) found in those who were in months 10-12 of treatment. The odds of depression<symptom> in women were higher than for men ( adjusted odds ratio ( aOR) 1.84 , 95 % CI 1.46-2.33). The odds of depression<symptom> were higher in patients living in concrete-built houses than in those living in mud-built houses ( aOR 1.37 , 95 % CI 1.03-1.82). Depression<symptom> is common in MDR-TB patients , and should be screened for and treated within MDR-TB treatment programmes.
