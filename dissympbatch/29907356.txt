  Several studies have examined the effect of vegetarian diets ( VD) on metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) or its components , but findings have been inconsistent. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) and observational studies to assess the association between VD and MetS or its components ( systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( DBP) , fasting glucose triglycerides , waist circumference ( WC) , HDL-cholesterol ( HDL-C)) in adults. The Cochrane Library , EMBASE , PubMed , Web of Science , and Scopus were searched. RCTs , cohort studies and cross-sectional studies evaluating the effects of VD on MetS or its components in adults , with omnivore diet as control group , were included. Random effects meta-analyses stratified by study design were employed to calculate pooled estimates. A total of 71 studies ( n = 103 008) met the inclusion criteria ( 6 RCTs , 2 cohorts , 63 cross-sectional). VD were not associated with MetS in comparison to omnivorous diet ( OR 0.96 , 95 % CI 0.50-1.85 , p = 0.9) according to meta-analysis of five cross-sectional studies. Likewise , meta-analysis of RCTs and cohort studies indicated that consumption of VD were not associated with MetS components. Meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies demonstrated that VD were significantly associated with lower levels of SBP ( mean difference ( MD) -4.18 mmHg , 95 % CI -5.57 to -2.80 , p < 0.00001) , DBP ( MD -3.03 mmHg , 95 % CI -4.93 to -1.13 , p = 0.002) , fasting glucose ( MD -0.26 mmol/L , 95 % CI -0.35 to -0.17 , p < 0.00001) , WC ( MD -1.63 cm , 95 % CI -3.13 to -0.13 , p = 0.03) , and HDL-C ( MD -0.05 mmol/L , 95 % CI -0.07 to -0.03 , p < 0.0001) in comparison to omnivorous diet. Heterogeneity of effects among cross-sectional studies was high. About , one-half of the included studies had high risk of bias. VD in comparison with omnivorous diet is not associated with a lower risk of MetS based on results of meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies. The association between VD and lower levels of SBP , DBP , HDL-C , and fasting glucose is uncertain due to high heterogeneity across the cross-sectional studies. Larger and controlled studies are needed to evaluate the association between VD and MetS and its components.
