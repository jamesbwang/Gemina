  The markers of metabolic syndrome<disease> can prompt the development of metabolic syndrome<disease> and are associated with worse graft function among transplant recipients. Studies have shown that exercise might be effective in reducing incidence rate of metabolic syndrome<disease> components in nontransplant patients. However , there is no sufficient evidence to determine whether exercise training is safe or effective for markers of metabolic syndrome<disease> among solid organ transplant recipients. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of exercise training programs for risk markers of metabolic syndrome<disease> and to further evaluate its long-term effects in solid organ transplant recipients. We systematically reviewed all randomized trials comparing the outcomes of exercise training in organ transplant recipients. The Cochrane Library , Joanna Briggs Institute EBP Database , PubMed , Embase , Web of Science Core Collection , ProQuest Health & Medical Complete , and SinoMed databases were searched to June 2017. The meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3. In total , 13 eligible trails involving 464 patients were included. Recipients who engaged in an exercise program after transplantation showed significant reductions in fasting blood glucose , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , triglycerides , and body mass index and a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein. But found no significant changes in new-onset diabetes , systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , total cholesterol , or low-density lipoprotein. Exercise training may be a promising intervention for markers of metabolic syndrome<disease> in transplant recipients. Further research is required to determine essential aspects of exercise according to organ transplantation type for effects on markers of metabolic
