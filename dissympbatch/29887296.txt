  Congenital scrotal agenesis ( CSA) is an extremely rare condition with fewer than 10 cases reported in the literature. These patients are often further complicated by undescended testicles as well as systemic developmental disorders. Herein , we report our experience and an innovative surgical technique for creation of a neo-scrotum in three children. We evaluated the records of three children in our database who were labeled as having an absent ( 1 patient) or severely underdeveloped scrotum ( 2 patients). Patients were aged 6 , 14 , and 16 months. All patients were uncircumcised , and the decision was made to create a neo-scrotum using the foreskin. The prepuce was harvested on a pedicle of dartos and transposed over the perineal cleft to create a neo-scrotal pouch. The flap was allowed to heal for 12-14 weeks , at which time the orchidopexy was performed. The follow-up to the surgery was 5 years , 3 years , and 6 months , respectively. There were no instances of flap necrosis<symptom> , dehiscence , or wound<disease> infection<disease> The three children had a capacious , aesthetically pleasing scrotal sac , which in all cases accommodated both testicles. In our experience , a well-vascularized preputial skin flap rotated to the perineum based on its ventral dartos pedicle provides an excellent source of tissue for creation of a neo-scrotum. We believe that the esthetic outcome of our technique rivals that of other reported techniques.
