  To compare the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT) and lifestyle modification ( LS) versus LS alone on weight , depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms , and stress response in women with polycystic ovary syndrome<disease> ( PCOS) , overweight/obesity , and depressive symptoms. A 16-week pilot randomized clinical trial. Tertiary-care PCOS center. Overweight/obese women with PCOS and depressive symptoms. Weekly CBT ( n = 7) or contact only/no therapy ( n = 8) for 8 weeks. Both groups received weekly LS for 16 weeks. Changes in weight , depression<symptom> ( Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression<symptom> Scale ( CES-D)) , anxiety<symptom> ( State-Trait Anxiety<symptom> Inventory ( STAI)) , quality of life ( Polycystic Ovary Syndrome<disease> Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire ( PCOSQ)) , laboratory tests , and response to a Trier Social Stress Test ( TSST). The CBT+LS group lost more weekly weight ( -0.35 kg/wk vs. -0.16 kg/wk) compared with the LS group. Overall , the CBT+LS group lost 3.2 kg versus 1.8 kg for the LS group. The CBT+LS group had greater improvement in PCOSQ at 8 weeks ( +3.7 vs. +1.2 points). In the overall cohort , STAI and CES-D decreased by -0.27 points per week and -0.31 points/wk , respectfully , and total and free T decreased at week 8. Heart rate response to TSST was lower at 15 minutes after stressor in the CBT+LS group. Weekly CBT+LS for 8 weeks compared with LS alone resulted in significant weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and improved quality of life in overweight/obese women with PCOS and depressive symptoms. These interventions were associated with a decreased autonomic response to a laboratory stressor , suggesting a potential link between CBT , weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , and modulation of the stress response.
