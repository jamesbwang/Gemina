  Gastroparesis following resection of a fourth ventricle tumor has never been reported in the literature. We report a unique case of gastroparesis following resection of a fourth ventricle ependymoma in a child. A 14-year-old boy presented with 12-day history of headache<symptom> , nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom>. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a tumor in the fourth ventricle. He underwent a posterior median craniotomy and total removal was achieved. Histology revealed an anaplastic ependymoma ( WHO Grade III). Three days after surgery , the patient complained of upper<symptom> abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom>. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed dilatation of the stomach. Gastroscopy revealed moderate gastritis<disease> , without gastric outlet obstruction. Nine days after surgery , he had a jejunal feeding tube ( J-tube) placed for nutritional support. After the patient 's oral intake improved and he could keep up with his nutritional requirements , the J-tube was discontinued 19 days after surgery. At the 2-months follow up , the patient had no neurological or gastrointestinal complaints. In conclusion , we report the first case of gastroparesis following resection of a fourth ventricle ependymoma in a child. Gastroparesis can recover spontaneously. We suspect that this may be due to reversible injury of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus.
