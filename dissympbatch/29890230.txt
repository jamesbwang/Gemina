  Snakes belonging to the genus Naja ( Elapid family) , also known as `` spitting cobras '' , can spit venom towards the eyes of the predator as a defensive strategy , causing painful and potentially blinding ocular envenoming. Venom ophthalmia<disease> is characterized by pain , hyperemia<symptom> , blepharitis , blepharospasm and corneal erosions. Elapid venom ophthalmia<disease> is not well documented and no specific treatment exists. Furthermore , accidental ejection of venom by non-spitting vipers , as Bothrops , also occurs. The Ex vivo Eye Irritation Test model ( EVEIT) has enabled important progress in the knowledge of chemical ocular burns. Considering the lack of experimental animal model , we adapted the EVEIT to study venom ophthalmia<disease> mechanisms. Ex vivo rabbit corneas<symptom> were exposed to venoms from spitting ( Naja mossambica , Naja nigricollis) and non-spitting ( Naja naja , Bothrops jararaca and Bothrops lanceolatus) snakes , and rinsed or not with water. The corneal thickness and the depth of damage were assessed using high-resolution optical coherence tomography ( HR-OCT) imaging and histological analysis. All Naja venoms induced significant corneal edema<symptom> , collagen structure disorganization and epithelial necrosis<symptom>. Corneas<symptom> envenomed by African N. mossambica and N. nigricollis venoms were completely opaque. Opacification was not observed in corneas<symptom> treated with venoms from non-spitting snakes , such as the Asian cobra , N. naja , and the vipers , B. jararaca and B. lanceolatus. Moreover , Bothrops venoms were able to damage the epithelium and cause collagen structure disorganization , but not edema<symptom>. Immediate water rinsing improved corneal<symptom> status<symptom> , though damage and edema<symptom> could still be observed. In conclusion , the present study shows that the EVEIT model was successfully adapted to set a new experimental ex vivo animal model of ophthalmia<disease> , caused by snake venoms , which will enable to explore new therapies for venom
