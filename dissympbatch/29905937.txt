  Myelodysplastic syndromes<disease> ( MDS) encompass a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by a broad clinical spectrum related to ineffective hematopoiesis leading to unilineage or multilineage cytopenias<symptom> , with a high propensity for transformation to acute myeloid leukemia<disease>. Iron overload has been recently identified as one of the important conditions complicating the management of these diverse disorders. The accumulation of iron is mainly related to chronic transfusions; however , evidence suggests a possible role for ineffective erythropoiesis and increased intestinal absorption of iron , related to altered hepcidin and growth differentiation factor-15 levels in the development of hemosiderosis in patients with MDS. In addition to its suggested role in the exacerbation of ineffective erythropoiesis , multiple reports have identified a prognostic implication for the development of iron overload in patients with MDS , with an improvement in overall survival after the initiation of iron chelation therapy. This review includes a detailed discussion of iron overload in patients with MDS whether they are undergoing supportive therapy or curative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , with a focus on the mechanism , diagnosis , and effect on survival as well as the optimal management of this highly variable complication.
