  7,3 ' ,4 '- Trihydroxyisoflavone ( 734THI) , a secondary metabolite derived from daidzein in soybean , possesses several biological activities , including antioxidant , skin whitening and anti-atopic dermatitis<disease> properties , but the poor aqueous solubility of 734THI has limited its application in medicine and cosmetic industry. The aim of the present study was to improve the physicochemical properties of 734THI using planetary ball mill preparation under a solvent-free process to improve its solubility and anti-pollutant activity. 734THI nanoparticle powder ( 734THIN) was successfully prepared by the planetary ball mill technique using polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 as the excipient. 734THIN effectively increased the aqueous solubility and cellular uptake of 734THI by improving its physicochemical properties , including particle size reduction , crystalline-amorphous transformation and intermolecular hydrogen bonding with polyvinylpyrrolidone K30. In addition , 734THIN inhibited the overexpression of COX-2 and MMP-9 by downregulating MAPK pathway signaling in particulate matter-exposed HaCaT keratinocytes , while raw 734THI in PBS with low aqueous solubility did not show any anti-inflammatory or antiaging activity. 734THIN may be used as an additive in anti-pollutant skin care products for preventing particulate matter-induced inflammation<symptom> and aging in skin.
