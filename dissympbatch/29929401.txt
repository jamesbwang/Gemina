  There are insufficient data on the aetiologic factors underlying splenic infarction ( SI). Therefore , there is no consensus regarding the appropriate diagnostic approach. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients admitted with SI from 1/2004 to 12/2014. Medical records were screened for the clinical presentation , underlying causes , associated medical conditions and methods of patient evaluation. We found 89 subjects with 90 episodes of SI. Presentation of SI was characterized by abdominal , flank and chest<symptom> pain<symptom> ( 82.2 % , 18.9 % , 7.8 % , respectively); leukocytosis ( in 67 % of tested subjects); elevated LDH ( 72 %) , CRP ( 97.5 %) and D-Dimer ( 100 %). The main underlying mechanisms were cardioembolic ( 54.4 %) , vascular ( 20 %) , haematologic disorders ( 15.6 %) and multiple causes ( 21.1 %). Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> and atherosclerosis were common in older patients ( age > 70 yrs) while antiphospholipid syndrome<disease> occurred exclusively in younger individuals. SI was the presentation of previously unknown medical conditions in 38 % of patients. Abdominal CT , ECG , echocardiography and blood cultures demonstrated the highest diagnostic yield. Contributing factors are identified in the majority of SI patients. We recommend CT , ECG , echocardiography and blood cultures in all cases. Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> should be sought in older patients , while APLS and haematologic disorders should be suspected in younger ones.
