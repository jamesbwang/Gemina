  Spinal muscular atrophy is a genetic neuromuscular disease characterised by muscle atrophy , hypotonia , weakness<symptom> , and progressive<symptom> paralysis<symptom>. Usually , these patients display increased fat mass deposition and reductions in fat-free mass and resting energy expenditure-an unfavourable condition that facilitates the development of obesity. However , weight management of these patients remains poorly described. Hence , the aim of this case report was to describe the clinical presentation and weight management of a 31-year-old male patient with spinal muscular atrophy type III , class I obesity , and metabolic syndrome<disease> treated for 1 year by means of a personalised multistep cognitive-behavioural treatment for obesity. The treatment produced a weight<symptom> loss<symptom> of 7.2 kg ( 7.1 %) , which was associated with a marked improvement in both the patient 's self-reported general conditions and obesity-related cardiometabolic profile , and no adverse effects in terms of spinal muscular atrophy ( i.e. , reductions in fat-free mass or resting energy expenditure).
