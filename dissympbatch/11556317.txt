  We investigated the clinical progress and bacteriological characteristics of infectious adverse events ( AEs) following acupuncture and compared patient characteristics between serious and non-serious outcome groups. A retrospective observational study was conducted in 1,174 patients with infectious complications associated with acupuncture at the emergency department ( ED) in a tertiary hospital in Korea between 2010 and 2014. Serious outcome was defined as development of septic shock<symptom> , admission to intensive care unit ( ICU) or attaining permanent morbidity. Forty-eight patients had certain causality and cellulitis<disease> , necrotizing fasciitis<disease> and osteomyelitis<disease> were common in order. Among them , 9 patients ( 18.8 %) were categorized into serious outcome group , and they showed devastating outcomes such as septic shock<symptom> ( n = 2) , ICU admission ( n = 4) , and permanent sequelae ( n = 5). The serious group had delayed admission to the ED after acupuncture ( 30.0 ( 4.0-55.0) vs. 3.0 ( 1.0-10.0) days , The infectious AEs after acupuncture may cause serious outcomes. Patients and primary physicians should be aware of the risk of infectious complications and make efforts to prevent them.
