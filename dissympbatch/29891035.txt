  We evaluated the effect of time spent in the emergency department ( ED) and process of care on mortality and length of hospital stay in patients with sepsis<disease> or septic shock<symptom>. An observational cohort study was conducted on 117 patients who came through the University of Louisville Hospital ED and subsequently were directly admitted to the intensive care unit ( ICU). Variables of interest were time in the ED from triage to physical transport to the ICU , from triage to antibiotic ( s) ordered , and from triage to antibiotic ( s) administered. Expected mortality was calculated according to the University Health System Consortium Database. Primary and secondary outcomes were in-hospital death and hospital length of stay in days , respectively. We found no significant association between time in the ED and mortality between survivors and nonsurvivors ( 5.5 versus 5.7 hours , P = 0.804). After adjusting for expected mortality , a 22 % increase in mortality risk was found for each hour delay from triage to antibiotic ( s) ordered; a 15 % increase in mortality risk was observed for each hour from triage to antibiotic ( s) given. Both time from triage to antibiotic ( s) ordered ( hazard ratio ( HR) = 0.8 , P = 0.044) and time from triage to antibiotic ( s) delivery ( HR = 0.79 , P = 0.0092) were independently associated with an increased hospital stay ( HR = 0.79 , P = 0.0092). Though no significant association between mortality and ED time was demonstrated , we observed a significant increase in mortality in septic patients with both delays in antibiotic ( s) order and administration. Delay in care also resulted in increased hospital stays both overall and in the ICU.
