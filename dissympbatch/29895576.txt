  Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia ( CML) presenting with isolated Central Nervous System ( CNS) blast crisis is an uncommon entity. A 22-year-old man , diagnosed with chronic phase CML in 2011 and was in haematological and cytogenetic remission until July 2016 , had acute onset headache<symptom> and vomiting with meningeal signs and was admitted elsewhere , investigated by brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) analysis and suspected to have tubercular meningitis<disease> , for which steroids and antitubercular medications were started. The patient 's sensorium further deteriorated , and Ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery was done for hydrocephalus<symptom> by a neurosurgeon. After 2 months of the illness , he was admitted to our hospital with a persistent headache<symptom> , vomiting and altered sensorium. CSF for cytospin confirmed myeloid blasts. He was still in haematological remission. So , a diagnosis of isolated CNS blast crisis was made. The patient was started on triple intrathecal chemotherapy and cranial radiotherapy. He had improvement with treatment and is still in remission.
