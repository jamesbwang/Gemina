  Carotid blowout syndrome<disease> ( CBS) is a catastrophic complication of aggressive treatment of head and neck cancer. Early detection of bleeding points with embolization is a life-saving procedure; however , some bleeding points may be difficult to identify. Our aim was to determine whether guidewire manipulation ( GWM) could be used to verify bleeding point locations in patients with CBS. Of the 92 patients with CBS referred for embolization in a 5-year period , 14 men and one woman ( mean age 58 years) had bleeding points at locations that could not be definitely determined. We used GWM to verify the presence of these bleeding points. We assessed the anatomy of the ruptured arteries , technical details of GWM , and the angiographic and clinical outcomes. Bleeding points were difficult to detect because of the presence of small arterial pouches ( n = 6) or multiple small arterial pouches ( n = 9) in the unilateral or bilateral carotid arteries. Bleeding point locations were accurately identified using GWM in the internal carotid artery ( n = 7) , carotid bulb ( n = 4) , or common carotid artery ( n = 4). Balloon-assisted GWM was applied in one patient. Fiber coils ( n = 15) and/or liquid adhesives ( n = 2) were used to occlude the affected artery. Endovascular management was technically successful in all patients and resulted in immediate cessation of hemorrhage<symptom> without recurrence in a mean 22-month clinical follow-up. GWM is a simple and effective method for verifying bleeding points in ruptured arteries and preventing erroneous occlusion by embolization.
