  In Ethiopia , Multi-drug resistant Tuberculosis<disease> ( MDR-TB) is one of the major public health problems that need great attention. Time to sputum<symptom> culture conversion is often used as an early predictive value for the final treatment outcome. Although guidelines for MDR-TB are frequently designed , medication freely provided , and centers for treatment duly expanded , studies on time to sputum<symptom> culture conversion have been very limited in Ethiopia. This study was aimed at determining the time to sputum<symptom> culture conversion and the determinants among MDR-TB patients at public Hospitals of the Amhara Regional State. A retrospective follow up study was conducted between September 2010 and December 2016. Three hundred ninety two MDR-TB patients were included in the study. Parametric frailty models were fitted and Cox Snell residual was used for goodness of fit , which the Akaike 's information criteria was used for model selection. Adjusted hazard ratio ( AHR) with a 95 % confidence interval ( CI) was reported to show the strength of association. Out of the 392 participants , sputum<symptom> culture changed for 340 ( 86.7 %) during the follow up period. The median culture conversion time in this study was 65 ( 60-70 days). Alcohol drinking ( AHR = 3.79 , 95 % CI = 1.65-8.68) , sputum<symptom> smear grading +2 ( AHR = 0.39 , 95 % CI 0.19-0.79) , smear grading +3 ( AHR = 0.30 , CI = 0.14-064) , cavitations ( AHR = 0.36 , 95 % CI = 0.19-0.68) , and consolidation ( AHR = 0.29 , CI = 0.13-0.69) were the determinants of time to sputum<symptom> culture conversion. In this study , time to sputum<symptom> culture was rapid as compared to 4 months WHO recommendation. Alcohol drinking , sputum<symptom> smear grading , cavitations and consolidations were found to be the determinants of time to sputum<symptom> culture conversion. Therefore , providing a special attention to patients who had baseline radiological finding is recommended , high bacillary load and patients with a history of alcohol intake at baseline should be given priority.
