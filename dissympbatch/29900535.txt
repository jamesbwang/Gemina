  Untargeted , high-throughput proteomics methodologies have great potential to aid in identifying biomarkers for the diagnosis of periodontal<disease> disease<disease> The application of such methods to the discovery of candidate biomarkers for the resolution of periodontal inflammation<symptom> after periodontal therapy has been investigated. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected from 10 patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis<disease> at baseline and 1 , 5 , 9 and 13 weeks after completion of mechanical periodontal treatment. Clinical indices of periodontal<disease> disease<disease> , including probing depth , recession , clinical attachment level and bleeding on probing , were recorded at baseline and 13 weeks. Samples were analyzed using an online liquid chromatography-nanoelectrospray-hybrid ion trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Spectra were processed with the PILOT_PROTEIN proteomics software suite. Clinical parameters were significantly improved 13 weeks after treatment ( Wilcoxon signed ranks test , P < .05). From the substantial number of identified proteins , a small subset was extracted by filter methods that included temporal pattern matching , logistic function fitting and mixed-integer linear optimization. This subset includes azurocidin , lysozyme C and myosin-9 as candidate biomarkers prominent at baseline and alpha-smooth muscle actin as prominent 13 weeks after treatment. Cross-validation studies yielded average predictive accuracy and area under the curve of 0.900 and 0.930 , respectively. High-throughput proteomic analysis can contribute to identifying endpoints of periodontal therapy. These candidate biomarkers should be evaluated for clinical efficacy.
