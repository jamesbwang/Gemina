  Advances in medical research has resulted in successful treatment of many life-threatening infectious<disease> diseases<disease> as well as autoimmune and lifestyle-related diseases , increasing life-expectancy of both the developed and developing world. As a result of a growing ageing population , the focus has also turned on chronic<disease> diseases<disease> which seriously affect the quality of older patient life. Xerostomia ( dry<symptom> mouth<symptom>) is one such condition , which leads to bad oral health and difficulty in consumption of dry foods and speech. Saliva substitutes are used to ease symptoms. However , they often do n't work properly and objective comparison of saliva substitutes to mimic natural salivary functions does not exist. The study thus aims to develop an ex vivo friction assay simulating dry<symptom> mouth<symptom> conditions and facilitating objective comparison of saliva substitutes. A reciprocating sliding tongue-enamel system was developed and compared to a PDMS ( polydimethylsiloxane)- PDMS friction system. The tongue-enamel system , but not the PDMS-PDMS model , showed high mucin-containing saliva ( unstimulated and submandibular/sublingual saliva) to give higher Relief than mucin-poor lubricants ( water , parotid<symptom> saliva , Dentaid Xeros) and correlated well ( r = 0.97) with in vivo mouth<symptom> feel. The tongue-enamel friction system mimicked dry<symptom> mouth<symptom> conditions and relief and seems suited to test agents meant to lubricate desiccated oral surfaces.
