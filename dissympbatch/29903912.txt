  Cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) 1 is a multi-factorial disease in which dysfunction of protease-antiprotease balance<symptom> plays a key role. The current CF therapy relies on dornase alfa , low dose macrolide antibiotics , hypertonic saline and antibiotics , and does not address the high neutrophil elastase ( NE) activity observed in the lung and sputum<symptom> of CF patients. Our hypothesis is that variants of heparin , which potently inhibit NE but are not anticoagulant , would help restore the protease-antiprotease balance<symptom> in CF. To realize this concept , we studied molecular principles governing the effectiveness of different heparins , especially 2-O ,3-O-desulfated heparin ( ODSH) , in the presence of sputum<symptom> components and therapeutic agents. Using sputa from CF patients and an NE activity assay , we found that heparins are ineffective if used in the absence of dornase. This is true even when mucolytics , such as DTT or N-acetyl cysteine , were used. Computational modeling suggested that ODSH and DNA compete for binding to an overlapping allosteric site on NE , which reduces the anti-NE potential of ODSH. NE inhibition of both DNA and ODSH is chain length dependent but ODSH chains exhibit higher potency per unit residue length. Likewise , ODSH chains exhibit higher NE inhibition potential in comparison to DNA chains in the presence of saline. These studies suggest fundamental differences in DNA and ODSH recognition and inhibition of NE despite engaging overlapping sites , which offer unique insights into molecular principles that could be used in developing anti-protease agents in the presence of current treatments , such as dornase and hypertonic saline.
