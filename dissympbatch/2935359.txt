  Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD) and/ or Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA) often complain about sleepiness , fatigue<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> However , common screening questionnaires , like Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS) , Fatigue<symptom> Severity Scale ( FSS) and Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale ( HADS) have not been previous evaluated in patients with overlap-coexisting COPD and OSA-syndrome versus patients with OSA alone. Our study compared ESS , FSS and HADS between patients with overlap syndrome<disease> and patients with OSA , before and after treatment with Continuous Positive Airways Pressure ( CPAP). We examined 38 patients with coexisting COPD and OSA versus 38 patients with OSA-only and 28 subjects without respiratory<disease> disease<disease> , serving as controls. All patients underwent pulmonary function tests ( PFTs) , oximetry and overnight polysomnography and completed the questionnaires , before and after 3 months of CPAP therapy. The two patient groups did not differ significantly in terms of age , Body Mass Index ( BMI) , neck , waist and hip circumferences , and arterial blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> values. They also had similar comorbidities. They differed significantly , as expected , in PFTs ( Forced Vital Capacity-FVC , 2.53 ± 0.73 vs 3.08 ± 0.85 lt , p = 0.005 , Forced Expiratory Volume in 1sec-FEV1 , 1.78 ± 0.53 vs 2.60 ± 0.73 lt/min , p < 0.001) and in daytime oximetry ( 94.75 ± 2.37 vs 96.13 ± 1.56 % , p = 0.007). ESS , HADS-Anxiety and HADS-Depression scores did not differ statistically significant between these two groups , whereas overlap syndrome<disease> patients expressed significantly more fatigue<symptom> ( FSS) than OSA-only patients , a finding that persisted even after 3 months of CPAP therapy. We conclude that sleepiness , anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> were similar in both groups , whereas fatigue<symptom> was more prominent in patients with overlap syndrome<disease> than in sleep apneic patients and did not ameliorate after treatment.
