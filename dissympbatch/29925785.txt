  Silkworm excrement ( SE) , is used as a traditional antirheumatic medicine in China. The present study was designed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of water fraction of SE ( ST) and ethanol fraction of SE ( CT) at two different doses on adjuvant induced arthritis<disease> ( AA) rats. Arthritis<disease> severity was evaluated by body<symptom> weight , paw thickness , histological changes and index of paws oedema and spleen. Serum samples were collected for estimation of biochemical indicators and cytokines. In addition , a metabonomic method based on the ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) had been established to investigate the holistic efficacy of SE by serum and urine. Multivariate statistical approaches , such as partial least-squares discriminant analysis ( PLS-DA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures squares-discriminant analysis ( OPLS-DA) were built to evaluate the therapeutic effects of SE and find potential biomarkers and metabolic pathways. Administration with SE significantly ameliorated the AA severity , including body<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , paw swelling , histological changes and the levels of biochemical index. 33 endogenous metabolites had been identified ( 10 in serum and 23 in urine) in the AA rats. Urinary and serum metabolic profiling revealed that the metabolites underpin the metabolic pathway including nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism; pentose and glucuronate interconversions; TCA cycle; beta-Alanine metabolism; purine metabolism and glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. The altered metabolites could be regulated closer to normal level after SE intervention. The results suggested SE possesses substantial anti-arthritic activity and demonstrated that metabonomics is a powerful tool to gain insight in the mechanism of SE formula in therapy.
