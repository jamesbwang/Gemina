  Psoriasis is a chronic , hyper-proliferative dermatological condition associated with joint<symptom> symptoms<symptom> known as psoriatic arthritis<disease> ( PsA). In a 2013 review , the total economic burden of PsA was estimated at $ 51.7- $ 63.2 billion. The economic burden of moderate to severe psoriasis patients has reduced significantly with the advent of biologics , but there remains a dearth of real-world evidence of the impact of treatment persistence on the economic burden of moderate to severe psoriasis and/or PsA patients. To evaluate the overall and psoriasis and/or PsA-related health care utilization and costs among patients who were persistent versus those nonpersistent on index biologic among the moderate to severe psoriasis and/or PsA population. Adult patients with ≥ 2 claims with diagnosis of psoriasis and/or PsA during the period of November 2010-October 2015 were identified from the U.S. Department of Defense database; the first diagnosis date during November 2011-October 2014 was defined as the index date. As of the index date , patients were considered to have moderate to severe psoriasis or PsA if they had ≥ 1 nontopical systemic therapy or phototherapy during the 1-year pre- or 1-month post-index date. Persistence to index therapy , defined as the first biologic used ( etanercept , adalimumab , ustekinumab , infliximab) on or within 30 days post-index date , was determined based on the biologic dosing schedule and a 90-day gap. Generalized linear models were used to compare the health care utilization and costs between persistent and nonpersistent patients during the 1-year post-index period. A total of 2,945 moderate to severe psoriasis and/or PsA patients were identified. Of those , 1,899 ( 64.5 %) were persistent and 1,046 ( 35.5 %) were nonpersistent. Compared with nonpersistent patients , persistent patients were older ( 49.2 vs. 45.5 years; P < 0.001) and more likely to be male ( 52 % vs. 45 %; P < 0.001). More persistent patients were diagnosed with dyslipidemia ( 40 % vs. 35 %; P = 0.002) , had lower antidepressant use ( 23.4 % vs. 27.4 %; P < 0.001) , and had lower anxiolytic use ( 30 % vs. 37 %; P < 0.001) compared with nonpersistent patients. After adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics , nonpersistent patients had higher total medical costs ( $ 12,457 vs. $ 8,964; P < 0.001) compared with persistent patients , and ambulatory visits ( 23.9 vs. 21.4; P = 0.007) were a major contributor. Approximately 40 % of the total overall medical costs were attributed to psoriasis and PsA. Although persistent patients incurred higher pharmacy costs ( $ 10,684 vs. $ 7,849; P < 0.001) due to higher biologic use and the potentially high per-unit cost of biologics , their psoriasis- and/or PsA-related medical costs were significantly lower than those of nonpersistent patients ( $ 3,395 vs. $ 5,041; P < 0.001). Total overall costs combining medical and pharmacy costs were similar between the cohorts ( $ 22,678 vs. $ 21,477; P = 0.122). Moderate to severe psoriasis and/or PsA patients who were persistent on index biologic treatment had higher pharmacy utilization and costs , albeit with lower medical costs and similar total costs , compared with nonpersistent patients.
