  Foot-and-mouth disease ( FMD) is an acute , highly contagious viral<disease> disease<disease> of domestic and wild cloven-hoofed animals , caused by FMD virus ( FMDV). An FMD outbreak can cause major production losses<symptom> and have significant implications for trade. Vaccination can assist in controlling the disease , and emergency vaccination using high antigen payload vaccines ( > 6 PD50/dose) is considered an important control approach in the event of an outbreak. In recent years there has been a divergence of serotype A viruses in South East Asia ( SEA) into several distinct genetic and antigenic clusters. Numerous variants were found to poorly match serotype A vaccines commonly included in international antigen banks. This study examined the ability of single vaccination with high-potency monovalent A22 IRQ vaccine to protect sheep following challenge with the A/VIT/15/ 2012 strain , just four days following vaccination. The vaccine proved effective at limiting clinical disease but did not prevent infection.
