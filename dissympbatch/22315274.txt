  Despite dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT) including potent P2Y12 inhibitors , recurrent ischaemic events occur in a significant number of patients after acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) , warranting new antithrombotic strategies. Combinations of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant ( NOAC) with antiplatelet therapy have been tested in several large phases II and III randomised trials. Overall , current evidence suggests that the use of NOACs on top of DAPT after ACS reduces the rate of recurrent ischaemic events , albeit at the price of increased risk for major bleeding. In the particular field of patients with ACS and atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> , NOACs may be associated with reduced bleeding complications compared with vitamin K antagonist. Further randomised trials evaluating low-dose NOAC combined with single antiplatelet therapy are warranted.
