  Medications and self care products may have adverse effects on the gingiva. These adverse effects can be divided into inflammation<symptom> , intrinsic discolouration , irritation , trauma , cytotoxicity , lichenoid reaction , and proliferation. This article deals with the first 6 types of adverse effects mentioned: a subsequent article will deal with the last type mentioned. Since contraceptives were introduced , there have been indications that they cause or promote gingivitis<disease> , but with the current contraceptives this adverse effect is rarely seen. Intrinsic discolouration of the gingiva has been reported when using Staloral Â® , minocycline , contraceptives and hydroxychloroquine. Irritation and trauma of the gingiva are seen when self care products containing carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide are used for external tooth whitening , or which have analgesic potential , such as acetylsalicylic acid and hydrogen peroxide or oral rinses containing alcohol.
