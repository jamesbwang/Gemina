  An increasing number of drugs including monoclonal antibodies and small molecules , either anti-inflammatory or immunity-enhancing , have been developed to treat human<disease> diseases<disease> and the number of medications in these classes is likely to expand in the future. The two most commonly used categories of such therapies are the anti-inflammatory group ( anti- tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF) Î± , anti-interleukins/interleukin receptors , and anti-integrin bodies) and the anti-tumoral agents ( immune checkpoint inhibitors , anti-CD20 , and anti-endothelial growth factor). Although the anti-inflammatory biologics have brought about a revolutionary effect in the management of a variety of autoimmune disorders including rheumatologic diseases , inflammatory bowel disease , and inflammatory dermatological diseases , their ability to induce colitis<disease> in patients without a prior history of colitis<disease> or exacerbate quiescent colitis<disease> has been increasingly and unexpectedly recognized. While the use of immune-augmenting monoclonal antibody therapies results in a significant survival benefit in a subset of patients with malignancies , these monoclonal antibodies also have the ability to cause colitis<disease> through an apparent autoimmune mechanism. Colitis<disease> associated with these medications may demonstrate multiple histologic patterns including increased apoptosis ( graft versus host disease ( GVHD)- like) , autoimmune enteropathy pattern , acute colitis<disease> pattern , ischemic colitis<disease> , inflammatory bowel disease pattern , either ulcerative colitis-like , Crohn 's disease-like , or fulminant colitis-like. In addition , anti-inflammatory biologics are known to cause or reactivate latent infections such as tuberculosis<disease> and increase the risk for malignancies including high-grade lymphomas as well as indolent lymphoproliferative disorders. Thus , the differential diagnosis for colitis<disease> in patients receiving therapeutic anti-inflammatory biologics or anti-tumoral agents can be broad. Optimal diagnosis and treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach. This review aims to provide an overview of the literature on the clinical features , histology , and treatment of these newly recognized anti-inflammatory biologic and anti-tumoral immune therapy-induced colitises<disease> and hopes this outlines will raise the vigilance of all clinicians of these entities.
