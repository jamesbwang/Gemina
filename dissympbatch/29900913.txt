 : Oral submucous fibrosis<disease> ( OSMF) is a most prevalent potentially malignant disorder associated with betel quid chewing frequently observed in the Indian population. The present study conducted is much of a keen interest because there is much new information , both in the press and the medical literature , about the benefits of fresh fruits and vegetables and antioxidants ( such as lycopene and curcumin) for both prevention and treatment of diseases. As clinicians , we often prescribe medications with significant adverse effects , and certainly , if armed with evidence to support using such antioxidants as safer therapeutic alternatives for treatment of OSMF. The aim of the study was to compare and evaluate the efficacy of lycopene and curcumin given orally in clinically diagnosed OSMF patients. Sixty patients were divided randomly into two groups Group A and Group B. After fulfilling the eligibility criteria , sixty patients were randomly allotted based on fishbowl method into thirty each. This technique eliminated the selection bias arising in the study. Group A individuals were treated with 4 mg of lycopene and Group B individuals were given 300 mg of curcumin thrice daily for 3 months. Both the groups were assessed in terms of mouth<symptom> opening and burning sensation. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS Version 16.0 statistical Analysis Software. In Group A , the initial burning sensation was 65.83 ± 3.98 % , and in Group B , it was 62.33 ± 5.22 % ( visual analog scale). After 3 months , there was complete cessation of burning sensation in both the groups. Burning sensation between the groups was statistically nonsignificant ( P > 0.05). In Group A , mean mouth<symptom> opening at baseline ( 1 Lycopene showed better results than curcumin in improving mouth<symptom> opening; both the drugs were equally effective in decreasing burning sensation in OSMF patients.
