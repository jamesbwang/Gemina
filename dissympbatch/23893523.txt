  Pericarditis<disease> is an inflammatory heart disease , which may be idiopathic or secondary to autoimmune or auto-inflammatory diseases and often leads to severe or life-threatening complications. Colchicine and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs represent the mainstay of treatment , whereas use of corticosteroids is associated with recurrence of disease flares. While effective and safe anti-inflammatory therapies remain an unmet clinical need , emerging clinical and experimental evidence points at a promising role of inhibition of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 ( IL-1). We thus evaluated treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra in a case of extremely severe pericarditis<disease> with cardiac tamponade and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> secondary to Erdheim-Chester disease ( ECD) , a rare clonal disorder of macrophages characterized by rampant inflammation<symptom> and multiorgan involvement. A 62-year-old man was admitted to the Emergency Department with severe pericardial<symptom> effusion<symptom> requiring the creation of a pleuro-pericardial window. A whole-body contrast-enhanced computed tomography pointed at a diagnosis of ECD with involvement of the heart and pericardium and of the retroperitoneal space. Over the following days , an echocardiography revealed a closure of the pleuro-pericardial window and a relapse of the pericardial<symptom> effusion<symptom> Treatment with anakinra , the recombinant form of the naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist , was started at a standard subcutaneous dose of 100 mg/day. After 2 days , we observed a dramatic clinical improvement , an abrupt reduction of the inflammatory markers , and a reabsorption of the pericardial<symptom> effusion<symptom> Anakinra was maintained as monotherapy , and the patient remained asymptomatic in the absence of disease flares for the following year. Recent studies point at inhibition of IL-1 activity as an attractive treatment option for patients with refractory idiopathic recurrent pericarditis<disease> Anakinra treatment may also have a role in patients with pericarditis<disease> in the setting of systemic inflammatory disorders , such as ECD.
