  HTLV-1 may cause severe diseases such as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic<disease> paraparesis<disease> ( HAM/TSP) and infective dermatitis<disease> associated to HTLV-1 ( IDH). The clinical characteristics and progression of 25 early onset HAM/TSP associated or not to IDH were described. Following-up 37 IDH patients with neurological examinations , 54 % developed HAM/TSP. To these cases were added five cases of juvenile HAM/TSP. The patients were HTLV-1 + and were submitted to dermatological and neurological examinations. Diagnosis of HAM/TSP was performed according to Osame et al ( 1990) and Castro-Costa et al ( 2006) criteria. Twenty-one patients were classified as definite HAM/TSP by both criteria , three as probable HAM/TSP by Osame et al and another as probable HAM/TSP according to Castro-Costa et al.. Median age at onset of neurological manifestations was 9 years for the IDH/HAM/TSP group and 16 years for the HAM/TSP group ( p = 0.045). In 12 patients , the onset of neurological manifestations occurred when they were less than 10 years of age. In the group IDH/HAM/TSP , the neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom> always begun during the period of activity of IDH. The progression of HAM/TSP evaluated in 17 cases was heterogeneous and three had rapid progressive course. The juvenile HAM/TSP may occur very early and also presents marked female predominance. Progression of IDH to HAM/TSP before 19 years of age is frequent ( 54 %). Rapid progressive form may also occur in early HAM/TSP. As juvenile IDH and HAM/TSP are due to vertical transmission through breastfeeding , it is very important to avoid this pathway of infection.
