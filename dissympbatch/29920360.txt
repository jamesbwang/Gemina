  Traditional herbal formula Gyejibokryeong-hwan ( GJBRH; Guizhifuling-wan , Keishibukuryo-gan) consisting five medicinal herbs has been used to treat uterine disorders , gynecological diseases and blood stasis syndrome<disease> in Asia. We evaluated the safety of GJBRH in Crl: CD Sprague-Dawley ( SD) rats over a period of 13 weeks. To confirm the stability of the components of GJBRH , we analyzed the component contents in GJBRH at different storage periods , using high-performance liquid chromatography. Male and female SD rats were orally administered with GJBRH at doses of 0 , 1000 , 2000 and 5000 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks and assessed after a 4-week recovery period. Mortality , changes in body<symptom> weight and food consumption , organ weights , hematology and serum biochemistry were monitored during the experimental period , along with clinical observations , ophthalmological examinations , urinalysis and histopathology. There were no significant differences among the eight marker compounds in GJBRH according to storage period. No significant GJBRH-treatment-related toxicological changes were observed in mortality or ophthalmological examinations in either sex. However , soft feces were observed in the male 5000 mg/kg/day group. In addition , there were significant changes in body<symptom> weight and food consumption in both male and female rats treated with GJBRH at a dose of 5000 mg/kg/day. In the hematological examinations , we found a significant increase in white blood cells , neutrophils and fibrinogen in the 5000 mg/kg/day groups. In the urinalysis , a decrease in the total protein and albumin and an increase in the ovalbumin/globulin ratio were observed in both male and female rats treated with GJBRH at a dose of 5000 mg/kg/day. Histopathological examinations revealed erosion/ulcers and dilated glands in the stomachs of males from the 5000 mg/kg/day group , and squamous cell hyperplasia<disease> and epithelial atrophy was observed in the stomachs of both male and female rats treated with GJBRH at a dose of 5000 mg/kg/day. The no-observed-adverse-effect level ( NOAEL) was 2000 mg/kg/day for both sexes.
