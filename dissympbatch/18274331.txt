  Intralesional bleomycin scelro-therapy has become a favored line of treatment for macrocystic lymphatic malformations. However the need for multiple sessions is a drawback associated with this treatment modality. Our aim is to document whether multiple session of intra- lesional sclero-therapy is necessary for complete resolution of cystic lymphatic malformation. Intralesional bleomycin under Ultrasound guidance was used for macrocystic lymphangioma at concentration of 3mg/ml but not exceeding the total dose ( 1mg/kg) body<symptom> weight for single session or cumulative dose of 5mg/kg. In all cases intralesional sclerosant ( ILS) was installed under proper aseptic precaution in operation theatre in general anesthesia or sedation depending on the site or size of lesion<symptom> and age of the patient. Age of patients at the time of enrolment in study ranged from 3 months to 18 years. Clinical examination was the main stay of diagnosis which was supplemented by USG and/or computed tomography. Compression of the lesion<symptom> site was done for few hours wherever it was possible after the ILS session. A total of 21 patients included in our study. The age ranged from 3 months to 18 years. Male to female ratio was 8:13. The most common site of involvement was neck and axilla followed by anterior chest wall and nape of the neck. Complete resolution after single session was observed in 90.5 % cases where as surgery was required in 9.5 % case. Major complication was observed in one patient , who had intralesional bleeding which was managed conservatively. Transient<symptom> pain<symptom> and fever<disease> was observed in 23.8 % of cases. Only two patient required surgical intervention where one had persistent subcutaneous fibrotic nodule<disease> and other one did not respond to ILS. Intralesional bleomycin is an effective treatment for macrocystic lesion<symptom> , and complete resolution may be achieved by single session of ILS if proper principle are followed.
