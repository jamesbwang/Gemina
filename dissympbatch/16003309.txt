  The aim of this paper is to study the outcome of single-layer end to side dunking pancreatojejunostomy technique in 32 patients of malignant pancreatic disease undergoing Whipple 's surgery in a tertiary care oncology centre in India. From January 2013 to January 2016 , 32 consecutive patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy for malignant diseases were analysed retrospectively. All the patients underwent standard Whipple 's operation. Pancreatojejunostomy was established in a single-layer end to side dunking manner with PDS 4-0. Various patient data , i.e. preoperative symptoms and demography , intra-operative time , blood<symptom> loss<symptom> and need of blood transfusion , postoperative hospital stay and complications , were noted. Mean operative time was 3.5 h approximately. Mean blood<symptom> loss<symptom> was 328 ml approx ( range 150-600 ml). Postoperative delayed gastric emptying was observed in 8 ( 25 %) patients. Three ( 9.4 %) patients developed superficial surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> Mean hospital stay was 16.5 days ( range 13-20 days). There were no pancreatic leak or fistula<disease> and no perioperative mortality. It is a feasible technique. It achieved zero leak rates , zero mortality and minimal morbidity without compromising any oncologic principles.
