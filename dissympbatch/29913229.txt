  Essential oils of herbal origin are widely used in the treatment of diseases of the upper and lower respiratory<disease> tract<symptom> primarily due to their antibacterial and antiviral effects. Menthol , the major component of the essential oil of mint ( Mentha) species , exhibits antispasmodic activity , which might result in improved lung function. In a randomized experiment , 106 healthy participants received nebulized peppermint , eucalyptus , or rosemary essential oil for 15 min or no treatment ( control). None of the essential oils had an impact on the measured spirometric variables ( forced vital capacity , peak expiratory flow , the ratio of the volume of air forcibly blown out in the first second to forced vital capacity). Participants ' expectations regarding the effects of essential oils did not affect their objective performance , however , they predicted perceived ( subjective) changes. Perceived and measured changes were not connected with each other. In conclusion , inhaled rosemary , peppermint , and eucalyptus essential oils ' subjective ( perceived) effect on spirometry is mediated at least partly by expectations.
