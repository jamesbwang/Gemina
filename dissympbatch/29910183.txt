  Muscular symptoms , including stiffness , myalgia<symptom> , cramps<disease> , and fatigue<symptom> , are present in the majority of the patients with hypopituitarism , adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism , but rhabdomyolysis , the rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle , is a rare manifestation. In most patients who develop rhabdomyolysis , precipitating factors , such as strenuous exercise or use of lipid-lowering drugs , can be identified. We report the case of a 23-year-old male with primary hypopituitarism who developed acute renal impairment ( AKI) with rhabdomyolysis after strenuous physical activity ( push-ups). His blood test confirmed marked hypopituitarism. Severe elevation of serum CK consistent with rhabdomyolysis was noted and an elevated creatinine indicated AKI and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome<disease> ( MODS). Patient 's condition improved significantly after continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT) , glucocorticoid hormone replacement therapy and aggressive hydration. MODS with rhabdomyolysis in patients with hypothyroidism is quite rare and we expect that this case report adds to the existing literature on this subject. We also emphasize that thyroid and adrenal gland status should be evaluated in patients with unexplained AKI , MODS and presenting with the symptoms of muscle<symptom> involvement<symptom>. We respectively reviewed 23 patients with hypopituitarism , adrenal Insufficiency and hypothyroidism induced rhabdomyolysis who were involved in the past 40 years relevant literatures. We report a successfully treated case of rhabdomyolysis , which is a rare but potentially serious complication of hypopituitarism. Screening for endocrine abnormality in patients with elevated muscle enzymes should be considered , since an early diagnosis and prompt treatment is essential to prevent rhabdomyolysis and its consequences.
