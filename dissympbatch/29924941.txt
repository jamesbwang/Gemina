  Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH) is a devastating disease characterized by progressive vasoconstriction and obliterative vascular remodeling that leads to right heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( RHF) and death. Current therapies do not target vascular remodeling and RHF , and only result in modest improvement of morbidity and mortality. To determine whether targeting HIF-2α with a HIF-2α-selective inhibitor could reverse PAH and RHF in different rodent PAH models. HIF-2α and its downstream genes in lung samples and pulmonary arterial endothelial cells ( PAECs) and smooth muscle cells ( SMCs) from idiopathic PAH ( IPAH) patients as well as different rodent PAH models. A HIF-2α selective inhibitor was used in human lung microvascular endothelial cells and in Egln1Tie2Cre mice , and Sugen 5416/hypoxia or monocrotaline-exposed rats. Upregulation of HIF-2α and its target genes were observed in lung tissues and isolated PAECs from IPAH patients and three distinct rodent PAH models. Pharmacological inhibition of HIF-2α by the HIF-2α translation inhibitor C76 reduced right ventricle systolic pressure ( RVSP) and RV hypertrophy and inhibited RHF and fibrosis<disease> as well as obliterative pulmonary vascular remodeling in Egln1Tie2Cre mice and Sugen 5416/hypoxia PAH rats. Treatment of monocrotaline-exposed PAH rats with C76 also reversed RVSP , RV hypertrophy and pulmonary vascular remodeling , prevented RHF , and promoted survival. These findings demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of HIF-2α is a promising novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of severe vascular remodeling and right heart<symptom> failure<symptom> in PAH patients.
