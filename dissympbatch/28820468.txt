  Inflammation<symptom> contributes heavily to the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis<disease> , cirrhosis , and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Inflammation<symptom> is probably a promising target for treatment of liver diseases. The natural products are considered as the potential source of new drug discovery and their pharmacological effects on hepatic inflammation<symptom> have been widely reported. In this review , the natural products with anti-hepatic inflammatory properties are summarized based on their pharmacological effects and mechanisms , which are related to the suppression on the inflammation<symptom> mediators including cytokines and chemokines , pattern recognition receptors , the activated transcriptional factors , and the potential regulatory factors. The clinical evidence is also summarized.
