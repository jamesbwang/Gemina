  Multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNT) have been reported to promote lung inflammation<symptom> and fibrosis<disease>. The commercial demand for nanoparticle-based materials has expanded rapidly and as demand for nanomaterials grows , so does the urgency of establishing an appreciation of the degree of health risk associated with their increased production and exposure. In this study , we examined whether MWCNT inhalation elicited pulmonary eosinophilic inflammation<symptom> and influenced the development of allergic airway inflammatory responses. Our data revealed that instillation of FA21 MWCNT into the airways of mice resulted in a rapid increase , within 24 h , in the number of eosinophils present in the lungs. The inflammatory response elicited was also associated with an increase in the level of cysteinyl leukotrienes ( cysLTs) present in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. CysLTs were implicated in the airway inflammatory response since pharmacological inhibition of their biosynthesis using the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor Zileuton resulted in a marked reduction in the severity of inflammation<symptom> observed. Moreover , FA21 MWCNT entering the airways of mice suffering from house dust mite ( HDM)- elicited allergic lung inflammation<symptom> markedly exacerbated the intensity of the airway inflammation<symptom>. This response was characterized by a pulmonary eosinophilia , lymphocyte<symptom> infiltration , and raised cysLT levels. The severity of pulmonary<symptom> inflammation<symptom> caused by either inhalation of MWCNT alone or in conjunction with HDM allergen correlated with the level of nickel present in the material , since preparations that contained higher levels of nickel ( FA21 , 5.54 % Ni by weight) were extremely effective at eliciting or exacerbating inflammatory or allergic responses while preparations containing lower amounts of nickel ( FA04 , 2.54 % Ni by weight) failed to initiate or exacerbate pulmonary<symptom> inflammation<symptom>. In summary , instillation of high nickel MWCNT into the lungs promoted eosinophilic inflammation<symptom> and caused an intense exacerbation of pre-existing allergic airway inflammation<symptom> by facilitating cysLT biosynthesis. These findings suggest that exposure to airborne MWCNT is likely to have adverse inflammatory effects in individuals suffering from atopic asthma and , in this context , further investigation of the therapeutic effects of pharmacological agents that block leukotriene synthesis is warranted.
