  Interleukin-35 ( IL-35) has recently been identified as an immunosuppressive cytokine that has been used as a potential therapy for chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. However , there remains a paucity of data regarding its potential benefits after integration into mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs). We used a dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS)- induced colitis<disease> mice model and treated them with IL-35-MSCs , MSCs or saline. The body<symptom> weight was recorded daily and inflammatory processes were determined. Cytokine secretion by lamina propria lymphocytes ( LPLs) and percentage of regulatory T cells ( Tregs) were also measured. The data showed that mice in the two treated groups recovered their body<symptom> weight more rapidly than mice treated with saline in the later stage of colitis<disease>. The colon lengths of IL-35-MSC-treated mice were markedly longer than those in the other two groups and the inflammation<symptom> reduced significantly. Furthermore , the percentage of Foxp3 + Tregs increased significantly and the level of proinflammatory cytokines produced by LPLs decreased significantly in the IL-35-MSC-treated group. The results demonstrate that IL-35-MSCs could ameliorate ulcerative colitis<disease> by down-regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
