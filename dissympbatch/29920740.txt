  Sessile serrated adenoma/polyp ( SSA/P) is regarded as a genetically homogeneous entity , with most lesions<symptom> harboring the BRAF V600E mutation. The present study aimed to reappraise the genetic heterogeneity of SSA/Ps and its clinicopathological significance. We performed next-generation sequencing of 272 SSA/Ps without dysplasia and evaluated morphologic and molecular features associated with the respective genotypes. BRAF V600E , BRAF non-V600E , KRAS , and NRAS mutations were found in 223 ( 82.0 %) , 3 ( 1.2 %) , 28 ( 10.3 %) , and 1 lesion<symptom> ( 0.4 %) , respectively. Notably , all lesions<symptom> with BRAF non-V600E mutations had either KRAS or NRAS mutations concurrently. Twenty SSA/Ps ( 7.4 %) were negative for these mutations. KRAS-mutated SSA/Ps were more often located in the distal colon ( 42 %) compared to those with the BRAF V600E mutation ( 14 %). Histologically , minimally serrated crypts and goblet cell-rich crypts were more common in KRAS-mutated and mutation-negative SSA/Ps. However , in most instances , SSA/Ps lacking the BRAF V600E mutation were morphologically indistinguishable from those with the BRAF V600E mutation. MUC5AC and MUC6 expression was common regardless of the mutation status , but more extensive in SSA/Ps with the BRAF V600E mutation. CpG island<disease> methylator phenotype-high was more frequent in SSA/Ps with the BRAF V600E mutation ( 60 %) , followed by mutation-negative SSA/Ps ( 40 %) , and KRAS-mutated SSA/Ps ( 16 %). The present study confirmed the common presence of the BRAF V600E mutation in SSA/Ps , but also demonstrated a degree of molecular heterogeneity of SSA/Ps. SSA/Ps with and without the BRAF V600E mutation showed slightly different but overlapping histological and molecular features. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
