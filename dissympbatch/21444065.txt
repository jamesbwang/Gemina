  A 44 year old man who presented with a history of chest<symptom> pain<symptom> and dyspnoea was found to have an aneurysm<disease> of the aortic root , aortic valve insufficiency , and coarctation of the aorta. The patient underwent a single stage procedure to treat the aortic root , valve and coarctation with a composite valved conduit and extra-anatomic bypass of the coarctation. The modified Cabrol technique was necessary to attach the coronary buttons due to grossly abnormal anatomy. The patient made a remarkable recovery and was discharged on the 8th post-operative day. This case report highlights the feasibility and efficacy of performing a single stage procedure on complex coarctation with associated cardiac defects. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of the modified Cabrol technique being used in this particular setting.
