  Advancing age is associated with impairments in numerous physiological systems , leading to an increased risk of chronic<disease> disease<disease> and disability , and reduced healthspan ( the period of high functioning healthy life). The plasma metabolome is thought to reflect changes in the activity of physiological systems that influence healthspan. Accordingly , we utilized an LC-MS metabolomics analysis of plasma collected from healthy young and older individuals to characterize global changes in small molecule abundances with age. Using a weighted gene correlation network analysis , similarly expressed metabolites were grouped into modules that were related to indicators of healthspan , including clinically-relevant markers of morphology ( body mass index , body fat , lean mass) , cardiovascular health ( systolic/diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , endothelial function) , renal function ( glomerular filtration rate) , and maximal aerobic exercise capacity in addition to conventional clinical blood markers ( e.g. , fasting glucose and lipids). Investigation of metabolic classes represented within each module revealed amino acid and lipid metabolism as significantly associated with age and indicators of healthspan. Further LC-MS/MS targeted analyses of the same samples were used to identify specific metabolites related to age and indicators of healthspan , including methionine and nitric oxide pathways , fatty acids and ceramides. Overall , these results demonstrate that plasma metabolomics profiles in general , and amino acid and lipid metabolism in particular , are associated with aging and indicators of healthspan in healthy adults.
