  To investigate the effect of asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis on clinical outcomes of patients undergoing trans urethral resection of prostate due to benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease>. A total of 514 patients were enrolled in the study. Clinical parameters and pathological results were compared before and one year after surgery. Of the patients 310 were diagnosed with purely benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> and the others were diagnosed with both prostatic inflamation ( cathegory IV) and benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease>. No statistical significance was observed between two groups among the parameters including age , prostate volume and post voiding residue ( P > 0.05). Patients with prostate inflammation<symptom> presented higher preoperative International Prostate Symptom Score and lower Qmax values when compared to those without inflammation<symptom> before trans urethral resection of prostate. Asymptomatic prostate inflammation<symptom> can lead to worsen lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary flow rate in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease>. Furthermore , the improvement of the complaints after surgery was worse in patients with asymptomatic prostate inflammation<symptom>. Further well designed prospective-randomised studies are needed to support our findings.
