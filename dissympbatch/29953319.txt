  Immunomodulatory monoclonal IgG1 antibodies developed for cancer and autoimmune disease have an inherent risk of systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vitro cytokine release assays are currently used to predict cytokine release syndrome<disease> ( CRS) risk , but the validation of these preclinical tools suffers from the limited number of characterized CRS-inducing IgG1 antibodies and the poor understanding of the mechanisms regulating cytokine release. Here , we incubated human whole blood from naïve healthy volunteers with four monoclonal IgG1 antibodies with different proven or predicted capacity to elicit CRS in clinic and measured cytokine release using a multiplex assay. We found that , in contrast to anti-CD52 antibodies ( Campath-1H homolog) that elicited high level of multiple inflammatory cytokines from human blood cells in vitro , other IgG1 antibodies with CRS-inducing potential consistently induced release of a single tested cytokine , interferon ( IFN)- γ , with a smaller magnitude than Campath. IFN-γ expression was observed as early as 2-4 h after incubation , mediated by natural killer cells , and dependent upon tumor necrosis<symptom> factor and FcγRIII. Importantly , the magnitude of the IFN-γ response elicited by IgG1 antibodies with CRS-inducing potential was determined by donor FcγRIIIa-V158F polymorphism. Overall , our results highlight the importance of FcγRIIIa-dependent IFN-γ release in preclinical cytokine release assay for the prediction of CRS risk associated with therapeutic IgG1 antibodies.
