  The roles of clinical etiology and symptoms , imaging findings and biochemical parameters in predicting the prognosis of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome<disease> ( PRES) have not been well-characterized. We perform a meta-analysis of all published studies to assess the value of various risk factors in predicting the prognosis of PRES. Searches of the PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane Library , and Web of Science databases were performed to identify the eligible studies. The odds ratios ( ORs) with their corresponding 95 % confidence interval ( CI) for related risk factors were used to calculate the pooled estimates of the outcomes. Six studies with 448 cases were included in the meta-analysis. Hemorrhage<symptom> was associated with high risk for poor outcome in patients with PRES. Toxemia<symptom> of pregnancy ( pre-eclampsia/eclampsia) was associated with improved outcome in PRES patients. Cytotoxic edema<symptom> was noted to be related to poor outcome , but did not show statistical significance. The pooled OR for hemorrhage<symptom> , pre-eclampsia/eclampsia , cytotoxic edema<symptom> was 4.93 ( 95 % CI: 3.94-6.17; P < 0.00001) , 0.24 ( 95 % CI: 0.15-0.40; P < 0.00001) and 2.59 ( 95 % CI: 0.84-7.99; P = 0.10) , respectively. PRES patients with hemorrhage<symptom> or cytotoxic edema<symptom> are likely to have poor outcomes. Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia is associated with reduced risk of poor outcome in patients with PRES.
