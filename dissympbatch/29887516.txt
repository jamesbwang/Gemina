  This paper argues that Chronic<symptom> Fatigue<symptom> Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis<disease> ( CFS/ME) constitutes a biopolitical problem , a scientific object which needs to be studied , classified and regulated. Assemblages of authorities , knowledges and techniques make CFS/ME subjects and shape their everyday conduct in an attempt to increase their supposed autonomy , wellbeing and health. CFS and CFS/ME identities are however made not only through government , scientific , and medical interventions but also by the patients themselves , a biosocial community who collaborates with scientists , educates itself about the intricacies of biomedicine , and contests psychiatric truth claims. CFS/ME is an illness trapped between medicine and psychology , an illness that is open to debate and therefore difficult to manage and standardise. The paper delineates different interventions by medicine , science , the state and the patients themselves and concludes that CFS/ME remains elusive , only partially standardised , in an on-going battle between all the different actors that want to define it for their own situated interests.
