  Metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) is a constellation of high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , hyperglycemia , obesity , and dyslipidemia. Its presence makes the patient more prone for cardiovascular events. Its prevalence has been documented as 11 % -41 %. The present study was undertaken to find out the demographic profile of the MetS in Kanpur region of northern India. This is a hospital based , cross-sectional study with adequate sample size. Out of the randomly selected 420 patients ( 232 males and 188 females) , 172 cases ( 61 males and 111 females) were found to have MeTS adopting the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. The overall prevalence of MeTS was found to be 40.9 % ( 26.2 % of total males and 59 % of total females). Among the 172 cases of MeTS , females were more than males ( 64.5 % vs. 35.4 %). Maximum numbers of MeTS cases were in the age range of 50-59 years ( 55/172 = 31.9 %) followed by 40-49 years ( 50/172 = 29 %) , > 60 years ( 35/172 = 20.3 %) , 30-39 years ( 30/172 = 17.4 %) , and < 30 years ( 2/172 = 1.1 %). In the total study population of 420 cases , hyperglycemia was the most common ( 29.2 %) and hyperglycemia , obesity , and high triglyceride were significantly higher prevalence in females. Among the participants of 111 cases of MeTS , hyperglycemia was the most common ( 71.5 %) and high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and low high density lipoprotein was significantly higher among males. The prevalence of MetS was more than 40 % and its prevalence in < 40 years age group is rapidly increasing. Its high time to be more active physically , before fatal cardiovascular events.
