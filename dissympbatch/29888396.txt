  Hypersensitivity<disease> to metals as a cause of implant-related complications has been a subject of controversy. Projections indicate an increase in the frequency of joint replacements of between 300 % and 600 % by the year 2030; therefore , this issue is of considerable interest. To evaluate sensitization to implant materials in patients with implant-related complications , to identify allergens , and to clarify whether hypersensitivity<disease> is a relevant cause. Patients with implant-related complications or a positive history of contact allergy and planned total joint replacements referred for allergological investigation between 2004 and 2017 were retrospectively analysed. In total , 311 patients were included. A positive patch test reaction to a metal was seen in 64.4 % of preoperative patients and in 54.6 % of patients with implant-related complications. Common alloy metals such as cobalt , chromium and titanium gave positive reactions in up to 2.9 % of patients with implant-related complications. None of the patients with skin<symptom> changes<symptom> had a positive patch test reaction to an implant metal. Other factors , such as the type of replaced joint and mechanical stress , seem to be more relevant for implant-related complications. Sensitization to metals or other materials seems to rarely play a role , and is overestimated.
