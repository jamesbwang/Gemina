  Sepsis‑associated encephalopathy ( SAE) is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome<disease> of which the precise associated mechanisms remain unclear. Synoviolin ( Syvn1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in conditions associated with chronic inflammation<symptom> , including rheumatoid arthritis<disease> , obesity , fibrosis<disease> and liver cirrhosis. However , the role of Syvn1 in acute<symptom> inflammation<symptom> is not clear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of Syvn1 in a septic mouse model induced by cecal ligation/perforation ( CLP). Metabolome analysis revealed that kynurenine ( KYN) , a key factor for the development of neuroinflammation , was increased in CLP‑induced septic mice. Notably , KYN was not detected in CLP‑induced septic Syvn1‑deficient mice. KYN is converted to kynurenic acid ( KYNA) by kynurenine aminotransferases ( KATs) , which has a neuroprotective effect. The expression of KAT4 was significantly increased in Syvn1‑deficient mice compared to that in wild‑type mice. Promoter analysis demonstrated that Syvn1 knockdown induced the KAT4 promoter activity , as assessed by luciferase reporter activity , whereas Syvn1 overexpression repressed this activity in a dose‑dependent manner. Furthermore , the KAT4 promoter was significantly activated by the transcriptional factors , NF‑E2‑related factor 2 and peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor coactivator 1β , which are targets of Syvn1‑induced degradation. In conclusion , the results of the current study demonstrates that the repression of Syvn1 expression induces the conversion of neurotoxic KYN to neuroprotective KYNA in a CLP‑induced mouse model of sepsis<disease> , and that Syvn1 is a potential novel target for the treatment of SAE.
