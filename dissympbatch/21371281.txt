  Patients with acute stroke are at high risk for infection. These infections are associated with unfavourable outcome after stroke. A prediction rule can identify the patients at the highest risk for strategies to prevent infection. We aim to develop a prediction rule for post-stroke pneumonia<disease> and other infections in patients with acute stroke. We used data from the Preventive Antibiotics in Stroke Study , a multicentre randomised trial comparing preventive ceftriaxone vs. standard stroke care in patients with acute stroke. Possible predictors for post-stroke pneumonia<disease> or infection were selected from the literature. Backward elimination logistic regression analysis was used to construct prediction rules for pneumonia<disease> or infection. Internal validation was performed and a risk chart was constructed. We adjusted for preventive antibiotic use. Pneumonia<disease> was diagnosed in 159 of the 2538 included patients , and infection in 348. Pneumonia<disease> was predicted by higher age , male sex , pre-stroke disability , medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , more severe stroke , dysphagia<symptom> and intracerebral haemorrhage ( rather than ischaemic stroke). Infections were predicted by higher age , male sex , history of diabetes , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , more severe stroke , dysphagia<symptom> , use of bladder catheter , preventive antibiotic use and intracerebral haemorrhage. With the prediction rule developed , risks for pneumonia<disease> ranged from 0.4 % to 56.2 % and from 1.8 % to 88.0 % for infection. Discrimination of the score was good ( C-statistic , 0.84; 95 % CI: 0.81-0.87 and 0.82; 95 % CI: 0.79-0.84 for pneumonia<disease> and infection). The Preventive Antibiotics in Stroke Study pneumonia<disease> and infection rule identify patients at the highest risk for post-stroke pneumonia<disease> or infection and may be used for future studies and novel therapies , after confirmation in an external population.
