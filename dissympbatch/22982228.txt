  Inflammation<symptom> and its associated cell signaling events have been well documented in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis<disease>. However , the potential for interleukin ( IL) -32 and its associated signaling to provoke an inflammatory response or to contribute in the pathogenesis of psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis<disease> are still in early phase. This study determined the role of IL-32 and nuclear transcription factor ( NF)- κB in patients with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis<disease>. Levels of IL-32 were determined in the plasma samples of patients with plaque psoriasis , psoriatic arthritis<disease> , and normal healthy subjects by human IL-32-specific Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. To investigate the role of a transcription factor in these patients , activated NF-κBp65 levels were determined in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) by highly sensitive NF-κB transcription factor kit. The levels of IL-32 in the plasma samples of plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis<disease> patients were found to be significantly higher as compared with the levels of IL-32 present in the normal human plasma samples ( This study shows the role of IL-32 and NF-κB in plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritic patients. Results indicate that IL-32 and NF-κB promote inflammation<symptom> in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis<disease>. Disruption of IL-32 or NF-κB signaling event might provide a novel target for the management of plaque psoriasis and psoriatic
