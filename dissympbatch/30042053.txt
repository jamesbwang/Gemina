  Liver disease is a significant health problem worldwide with mortality reaching around 2 million deaths a year. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease ( ALD) are the major causes of chronic liver disease. Pathologically , NAFLD and ALD share similar patterns of hepatic disorders ranging from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis , fibrosis<disease> and cirrhosis. It is becoming increasingly important to identify new pharmacological targets , given that there is no FDA-approved therapy yet for either NAFLD or ALD. Since the evolution of liver diseases is a multifactorial process , several mechanisms involving parenchymal and non-parenchymal hepatic cells contribute to the initiation and progression of liver pathologies. Moreover , certain protective molecular pathways become repressed during liver injury including signaling pathways such as the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP) pathway. cAMP , a key second messenger molecule , regulates various cellular functions including lipid metabolism , inflammation<symptom> , cell differentiation and injury by affecting gene/protein expression and function. This review addresses the current understanding of the role of cAMP metabolism and consequent cAMP signaling pathway ( s) in the context of liver health and disease. The cAMP pathway is extremely sophisticated and complex with specific cellular functions dictated by numerous factors such abundance , localization and degradation by phosphodiesterases ( PDEs). Furthermore , because of the distinct yet divergent roles of both of its effector molecules , the cAMP pathway is extensively targeted in liver injury to modify its role from physiological to therapeutic , depending on the hepatic condition. This review also examines the behavior of the cAMP-dependent pathway in NAFLD , ALD and in other liver diseases and focuses on PDE inhibition as an excellent therapeutic target in these conditions.
