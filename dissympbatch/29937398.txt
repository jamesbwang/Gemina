  Recessive inherited disorder lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase ( LCAT) deficiency causes severe hypocholesterolemia and nephrotic syndrome<disease>. Characteristic lipoprotein subfractions have been observed in familial LCAT deficiency ( FLD) with renal damage. We described a case of acquired LCAT deficiencies with literature review. The lipoprotein profiles examined by gel permeation-high-performance liquid chromatography ( GP-HPLC) and native 2-dimensional electrophoresis before and after prednisolone ( PSL) treatment. Here we describe the case of a 67-year-old man with severely low levels of cholesterol. The serum LCAT activity was undetectable , and autoantibodies against it were detected. The patient developed nephrotic syndrome<disease> at the age of 70 years. Renal biopsy revealed not only membranous glomerulonephritis<disease> but also lesions<symptom> similar to those seen in FLD. We initiated PSL treatment , which resulted in remission of the nephrotic syndrome<disease>. In GP-HPLC analysis , lipoprotein profile was similar to that of FLD although lipoprotein X level was low. Acquired LCAT deficiencies are extremely rare with only 7 known cases including ours. Patients with undetectable LCAT activity levels develop nephrotic syndrome<disease> that requires PSL treatment; cases whose LCAT activity levels can be determined may also develop nephrotic syndrome<disease> , but spontaneously recover. Lipoprotein X may play a role in the development of renal impairment in individuals with FLD. However , the effect might be less significant in individuals with acquired LCAT deficiency.
