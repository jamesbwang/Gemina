  Acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) is closely related to unstable plaques and secondary thrombosis. The inflammatory cells in plaques and their inflammatory products may be the cause for plaque instability and ruptures. The study aimed to disclose the changes of inflammatory factors including serum intracellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1) , chitinase-3-like protein 1 ( YKL-40) , and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 ( Lp-PLA2) in patients with ACS and its clinical significance. A total of 120 patients with coronary heart disease ( CHD) were categorized into 2 groups: 69 with ACS and 51 with stable angina pectoris ( SAP); 20 patients with chest<symptom> pain<symptom> and normal angiography served as a control group. The 120 patients with CHD were categorized into single-vessel disease group , double-vessel disease group , and three-vessel disease group based on the number of coronary artery stenosis. The severity of coronary artery stenosis was quantified based on coronary angiography using Gensini score. They were further divided into mild CHD group with its Gensini score < 26 ( n = 36) , moderate CHD group with its Gensini score being 26-54 ( n = 48) and severe CHD group with its Gensini score > 54 ( n = 36). Serum levels of ICAM-1 , YKL-40 , and Lp-PLA2 of different groups were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Correlation between ICAM-1 , YKL-40 , Lp-PLA2 , and Gensini score was analyzed. The levels of serum inflammatory factors ICAM-1 , YKL-40 , and Lp-PLA2 were significantly higher in the ACS group than those in control group and SAP group ( all P < 0.05); and compared with control group , no significant difference was observed in terms of the serum ICAM-1 , YKL-40 , and Lp-PLA2 levels in the SAP group ( P > 0.05). The levels of serum ICAM-1 , YKL-40 , and Lp-PLA2 were not significantly different among control group , single-vessel disease group , double-vessel disease group , and three-vessel disease group ( all P > 0.05). The levels of serum ICAM-1 , YKL-40 , and Lp-PLA2 were not significantly different among control group , mild CHD group ( Gensini score < 26) , moderate CHD group ( Gensini score 26-54) , and severe CHD group ( Gensini score > 54) ( all P > 0.05). Nonparametric Spearman correlation analysis showed that the levels of serum ICAM-1 , YKL-40 , and Lp-PLA2 were not correlated with the Gensini score in CHD patients ( r = 0.093 , r = -0.149 , and r = -0.085 , all P > 0.05; respectively). The serum levels of ICAM-1 , YKL-40 , and Lp-PLA2 were correlated with different clinical types of CHD , but not well correlated the severity and extent of artery stenosis , suggesting that ICAM-1 , YKL-40 , and Lp-PLA2 might be involved in occurrence of instability of atherosclerotic plaque , and might reflect the severity of CHD mostly through reflecting the plaque stability.
