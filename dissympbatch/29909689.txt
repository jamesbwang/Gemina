  Intra-articular ( IA) injections are commonly used to treat knee arthritis<disease> pain<symptom>; however , whether their efficacy generalizes to ankle arthritis<disease> remains debatable. We aimed to evaluate the evidence for IA therapies in the management of this patient population. We performed a literature search for observational and randomized controlled trials ( RCTs). Treatments included corticosteroids ( CS) , hyaluronic acid ( HA) , platelet-rich plasma ( PRP) , and mesenchymal stem cells ( MSC). We extracted study details , patient demographics , treatment characteristics , efficacy outcomes , and safety. When feasible , data from RCTs were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were calculated. A P value < .05 was considered statistically significant. We identified 27 studies ( 1085 patients). Ankle OA , rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) , and hemophilic arthropathy populations were examined. The majority of studies were observational ( 20 studies); the only RCTs were those evaluating HA. Case series demonstrated favorable results in terms of symptomatic relief with CS , HA , PRP , and MSC injections; however , the effects of CS may only be short term and the evidence on MSCs was limited to 1 study with 6 ankle OA patients. Pooled results ( 3 RCTs , 109 patients) suggested significantly improved Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale scores with HA over saline at 6 months , with a mean difference of 12.47 points ( 95 % CI 1.18-23.77 , P = .03). Evidence from small trials favors HA and PRP injections for the treatment of pain associated with ankle osteoarthritis. However , the relative efficacy of all injectable therapies is far from definitive and warrants further high-quality comparative trials. Level III , systematic review.
