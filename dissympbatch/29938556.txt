  Mesenchymal dysplasias or inherited connective tissue diseases are the group of diseases with deficiency of various components of connective tissue. Connective tissue disorders can affect different organs: skeleton , sight organ , skin , lungs , heart. But the most dangerous is vascular wall insufficiency leading to high risk of hemorrhage<symptom> , especially during pregnancy and delivery due to hemodynamic and hormonal effects on the walls of the modified vessels Aim: to evaluate the risk of complications during the pregnancy and delivery in patients with mesenchymal dysplasias. Fifty-six pregnancies in patients with mesenchymal dysplasias , including subclinical forms of diseases: 23 with Marfan syndrome<disease> ( I group) , 22 with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome<disease> ( II group) and 11 with Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome<disease> ( hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) ( III group) of the age from 18 to 36. The study included retrospective analysis ( for the period from 1993 to 2005) and prospective study. Results of study showed high risk of life-threatening complications during pregnancy and delivery , especially the risk of hemorrhage<symptom> and cardiovascular complications. In all the patients we observed the progression of bleeding or development of bleeding in new localizations ( epistaxis<symptom> in 27 patients , easy brushing in 22 , skin and mucosa telangiectasia in 20 , gastrointestinal bleedings<symptom> in 4 , haemoptysis in 4 , hematomas for minor traumas in 14 , conjunctivas hemorrhages<symptom> in 5). The pathogenesis of bleeding in such patients has mixed pattern: besides vascular wall pathology coagulation deficiency plays some role. The preferred delivery method for such patients is caesarean section. Deep vaginal ruptures and serious hemorrhage<symptom> accompany vaginal delivery.
