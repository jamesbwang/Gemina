  Stroke is a major cause of disability and death in the United States and across the world , and the incidence and prevalence of stroke are expected to rise significantly due to an aging population. Obstructive sleep apnea , an established independent risk factor for stroke , is a highly prevalent disease that is estimated to double the risk of stroke. It remains uncertain whether non-apnea sleep disorders increase the risk of stroke. Areas covered: This paper reviews the literature describing the association between incident stroke and sleep apnea , rapid eye movement<symptom> sleep behavior disorder , restless legs syndrome<disease> , periodic limb<symptom> movements<symptom> of sleep , insomnia , and shift work. Expert commentary: Trials of continuous positive airway pressure for stroke prevention in sleep apnea patients have been largely disappointing , but additional trials that target populations not yet optimally studied are needed. Self-reported short and long sleep duration may be associated with incident stroke. However , abnormal sleep duration may be a marker of chronic<disease> disease<disease> , which may itself be associated with incident stroke. The relationship between non-apnea sleep disorders and incident stroke deserves further attention. Identification of specific non-apnea sleep disorders or sleep problems that convey an increased risk for stroke may provide novel targets for stroke prevention.
