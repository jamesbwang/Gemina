  This study aims to investigate the association of pentraxin 3 ( PTX3) with neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio ( NLR) rather than the disease activity score 28 using C-reactive protein in rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA). The study included 59 RA patients ( 11 males , 48 females; mean age 53.79 ± 13.55 years; range 40 to 66 years) and 20 healthy controls ( 5 males , 15 females; mean age 50.41 ± 6.11 years; range 43 to 56 years). Complete blood count tests were recorded and NLR and platelet/ lymphocyte<symptom> ratio were calculated. PTX3 and interleukin-6 levels were examined in serum samples. Disease activity of RA patients was assessed by disease activity score 28. Demographic characteristics were similar between the two groups , with no statistically significant difference in terms of sex , age , and body mass index ( p > 0.05). NLR , PTX3 and interleukin-6 levels were higher in patients with RA than the control group ( p < 0.05). While erythrocyte sedimentation rate had a positive correlation with mean platelet volume , we found no correlation between NLR and other parameters of disease activity , PTX3 , and interleukin-6. We found no correlation between PTX3 and disease activity score 28 or NLR , although PTX3 levels were higher in RA patients than the controls. As a result , we were unable to establish a relationship between PTX3 and disease activity , directly or indirectly. To our knowledge , our study was the first to investigate the relationship between PTX3 and NLR.
