  Pre-operative embolization is an effective treatment strategy for hypervascular intracranial and skull base tumors. However , neurological complications resulting from tumor swelling , cranial nerve ischemia , or hemorrhage<symptom> can occur after embolization. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neurological complications following pre-operative embolization and minor adverse events including fever<disease> , headache<symptom> , or increasing inflammation<symptom> , which are common after embolization for abdominal tumors ( i.e. , post-embolization syndrome<disease> , PES). We retrospectively reviewed 39 consecutive patients with pre-operative embolization for intracranial and skull base tumors. Neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom> and minor adverse events were regularly observed after embolization. The degree of devascularization was evaluated using enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. We also evaluated changes in peritumoral edema<symptom>. Neurological complications occurred in eight cases , five of whom had exacerbation of existing neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , which occurred concurrent with a general inflammatory response. We termed this clinical condition post-embolization neurological<disease> syndrome<disease> ( PENS). The mean time to neurological<symptom> symptom<symptom> onset was 37.2 h after embolization. PENS was self-limiting in all cases but one , which required emergency surgery. The remaining three cases were diagnosed with cranial nerve ischemia. PENS is an important neurological complication after pre-operative embolization , which should be distinguished from ischemic or hemorrhagic complications. PES is a minor complication with favorable prognosis , whereas PENS should be considered as a dangerous clinical sign that may require emergency treatment. Further experiments are needed to elucidate the pathology of PENS.
