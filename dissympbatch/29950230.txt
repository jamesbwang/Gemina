  To explore the relationship between driver mutations and clinical characteristics in patients with Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph) negative myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPN) , so as to provide evidence for diagno-sis and treatment of the disease. The clinical data of 410 patients with classic Ph negative MPN including 150 cases of polycythemia vera ( PV) , 188 cases of essential thrombocythemia ( ET) and 72 cases of primary myelofibrosis ( PMF) from January 2013 to December 2016 in Fujian Medical University Union Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The PCR or DNA sequencing were used for JAK2 V617F , JAK2 exon12 , CALR and MPL W515L/K mutation analyses , and follow-up information on patients was updated by direct phone call or follow-up in outpatient. Among the 410 patients with Ph negative MPN , 136 ( 33.2 %) cases were asymptomatic at diagnosis. 389 cases were sequenced and JAK2 V617F was detected in 87.1 % ( 122/140) of PV , 64.1 % ( 118/184) of ET , 64.6 % ( 42/65) of PMF; JAK2 exon 12 mutation in 1 case of PV; MPL W515L/K mutation in 1 case of ET and PMF , respectively; CALR mutation in 18 ( 9.8 %) cases of ET and 5 ( 7.7 %) cases of PMF. JAK2 V617F mutated PV patients ocourred in older age: the white blood cell count , platelet count and incidence of splenomegaly<symptom> were higher than JAK2-negative PV cases ( P < 0.05). Compared with JAK2 V617F mutated ET patients , CALR mutated ET cases displayed younger age , lower leukocyte count , higher platelet count and lower incidence of thrombosis; JAK2-negative ET cases had younger age , lower leukocyte count , lower hemoglobin level , higher platelet count and lower incidence of thrombosis ( P < 0.05). The incidence of splenomegaly<symptom> in JAK2 V617F or CALR mutated PMF patients was both higher than that in JAK2-negative PMF cases , but the incidence of leukemia<disease> transformation in JAK2-negative PMF patients was higher than that in JAK2 V617F mutated cases ( P < 0.05). The types of driver mutations are closely related with the clinical features and prognosis in Ph
