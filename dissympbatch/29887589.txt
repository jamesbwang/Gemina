  A 66-year-old man was hospitalized for diverticular bleeding of the colon. Anticoagulant drugs ( Dabigatran and Beraprost sodium) , which had been taken for chronic underlying atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> , were interrupted for three days. After two months , he presented with acute pancreatitis<disease> and a pancreatic pseudocyst. The contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed an atrial thrombus and localized splenic infarction. Consequently , we suspected ischemic acute pancreatitis<disease> secondary to thrombus. Anticoagulant drug interruption and the resultant local ischemia were potential factors contributing to ischemic
