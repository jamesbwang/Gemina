  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy ( TTC) , also known as transient left ventricular ballooning syndrome<disease> , is a stress-induced-cardiomyopathy. It is precipitated by emotional or physical stress and is characterized by normal coronary arteries and transient regional wall motion abnormalities. Variants of TTC include apical ballooning syndrome<disease> and , less commonly , mid , basal , and local variants. New onset heart<symptom> failure<symptom> or acute coronary syndromes<disease> are a common presentation of TTC. Arrhythmias such as VT , VF , and torsade de pointes have also been reported. We present here a 42-year-old man with an inverted Takotsubo variant with pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> and transient accelerated idioventricular rhythm. He was initially admitted in the Emergency Department for acute and non-complicated appendicitis<disease> Coronary angiogram showed normal coronary arteries and left ventriculography revealed a reverse variant of TTC. The patient had completely recovered. Myocarditis<disease> was ruled out by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
