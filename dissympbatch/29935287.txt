  Pattern recognition receptors can recognize pathogens , and then cells are induced to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon by multiple signaling pathways. Nevertheless , excessive inflammation<symptom> disrupts immune homeostasis , thereby inducing autoimmune and inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>. Thus , the regulation of immune responses is extremely important for host to keep homeostasis. In this study , we found that miR-19a plays a negative regulator in MyD88-mediated NF-ÎºB signaling pathway by targeting MyD88 in miiuy croaker. Furthermore , over-expression of miR-19a in macrophages suppresses the expression of MyD88 and its downstream signaling genes of IRAK1 , IRAK4 and TRAF6 , whereas , the inhibitor of miR-19a has opposite effect. This study can increase our knowledge and help us to furthermore understand miRNAs regulatory mechanism in teleost fish.
