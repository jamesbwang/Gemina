  Guselkumab , a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin 23 , has been approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Psoriatic arthritis<disease> is a common comorbidity of psoriasis with an umet need for novel treatments. We assessed the efficacy and safety of guselkumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis<disease>. We did a randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase 2a trial at 34 rheumatology and dermatology practices in Canada , Germany , Poland , Romania , Russia , Spain , and the USA. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older with active psoriatic arthritis<disease> and plaque psoriasis affecting at least 3 % of their body surface area , with three or more of 66 tender joints and three or more of 68 swollen joints , who had an inadequate response or intolerance to standard treatments. We randomly assigned patients ( 2:1) via a central interactive web-response system using computer-generated permuted blocks with a block size of six , stratified by previous anti-tumour necrosis<symptom> factor-α use , to receive subcutaneous guselkumab 100 mg or placebo at week 0 , week 4 , and every 8 weeks thereafter for 24 weeks. Patients , investigators , and site staff were masked to treatment assignment until final database lock at week 56. At week 16 , patients with less than 5 % improvement in swollen and tender joint counts were eligible for early escape to ustekinumab. At week 24 , the remaining placebo-treated patients crossed over to receive guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 24 , 28 , 36 , and 44 and guselkumab-treated patients received a placebo injection at week 24 , followed by guselkumab injections at weeks 28 , 36 , and 44. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with at least 20 % improvement at week 24 in signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis<disease> according to American College of Rheumatology criteria ( ACR20) in the modified intention-to-treat population ( ie , all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment). Safety analyses included patients according to the study drug received. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT02319759. Between March 27 , 2015 , and Jan 17 , 2017 , we randomly assigned 149 patients to treatment: 100 to guselkumab and 49 to placebo. 17 ( 35 %) of 49 patients in the placebo group and ten ( 10 %) of 100 patients in the guselkumab group were eligible for early escape to ustekinumab at week 16. 29 ( 59 %) of 49 patients in the placebo group crossed over and received guselkumab at week 24. Three ( 6 %) of 49 patients in the placebo group , one ( 3 %) of 29 patients who crossed over from placebo to guselkumab , and six ( 6 %) of 100 patients in the guselkumab group discontinued study treatment before week 44. 58 ( 58 %) of 100 patients in the guselkumab group and nine ( 18 %) of 49 patients in the placebo group achieved an ACR20 response at week 24 ( percentage difference 39 · 7 % ( 95 % CI 25 · 3-54 · 1); p < 0 · 0001). Between week 0 and week 24 , 36 ( 36 %) of 100 guselkumab-treated patients and 16 ( 33 %) of 49 placebo-treated patients had at least one adverse event. The most frequent adverse event was infection in both groups ( 16 ( 16 %) of 100 patients in the guselkumab group vs ten ( 20 %) of 49 patients in the placebo group). The prevalence of adverse events between week 0 and week 56 in guselkumab-treated patients ( 51 ( 40 %) of 129) indicated no disproportional increase with longer guselkumab exposure. No deaths occurred. Guselkumab , a novel anti-interleukin 23p19 antibody , significantly improved signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis<disease> and was well tolerated during 44 weeks of treatment. The results of this study support further development of guselkumab as a novel and comprehensive treatment in psoriatic arthritis<disease>. Janssen Research & Development.
