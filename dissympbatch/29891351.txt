  In March 2009 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration licensed an inactivated Vero cell culture-derived Japanese<disease> encephalitis<disease> vaccine ( JE-VC ( IXIARO ®)) for use in persons aged ≥ 17 years. In 2013 , licensure was extended to include children aged ≥ 2 months. A previous analysis reviewed adverse events reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS) from May 2009 through April 2012. We reviewed adverse events reported to VAERS following JE-VC administered from May 1 , 2012 through April 30 , 2016. Adverse event reporting rates were calculated using 802,229 doses distributed. During the 4-year period , 119 adverse event reports were received for a reporting rate of 14.8 per 100,000 doses distributed. Nine ( 8 %) adverse events were classified as serious for a reporting rate of 1.1 per 100,000 distributed. The most commonly reported event was hypersensitivity<disease> ( n = 24; 20 %) for a rate of 3.0 per 100,000 doses distributed; 1 anaphylaxis event was reported. Ten ( 8 %) neurologic events were reported for a rate of 1.2 per 100,000 doses distributed; 2 events were classified as seizures<symptom>. Sixty-three ( 53 %) adverse events occurred after a first dose of JE-VC. Eighty ( 67 %) adverse events occurred after administration of JE-VC with other vaccines. Eleven ( 9 %) adverse events were reported in children; 1 was considered serious. These data continue to support the generally favorable safety profile of JE-VC. Reporting rates of adverse events were similar to those of the previous analysis. Although reporting rates of adverse events in children could not be calculated , there were low numbers of reported events in this age group. Post-licensure adverse event surveillance for this relatively new vaccine continues to be important to monitor adverse event reporting rates and identify possible rare serious events.
