  Myelodysplastic syndrome<disease> ( MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem cells , characterized by dysplastic hematopoiesis and dysregulated immune system resulting in various clinical conditions. Paraneoplastic inflammatory syndromes<disease> , which are well known to be associated with MDS , show response to immune-modulated therapy and often disappear during the course of hematologic management. Azacitidine ( 5-Aza) was shown to prolong survival of high-risk MDS patients , however , the effects of 5-Aza on paraneoplastic inflammation<symptom> in MDS have yet to be elucidated. 5-Aza was administered to a 60-year-old man with MDS accompanying Sweet 's syndrome<disease> at a dose of 75 mg/m
