  Autoimmune metaplastic atrophic gastritis<disease> is a chronic progressive inflammatory condition. The clinical spectrum includes pernicious anemia<symptom> , atrophic gastritis<disease> , antibodies to parietal cell antigens and intrinsic factor , achlorhydria , hypergastrinemia and carcinoma. It is rare in paediatric cohorts. We present the case of a boy with metaplastic atrophic gastritis<disease> in whom immune dysregulation , polyendocrinopathy , enteropathy , X-linked ( IPEX) syndrome<disease> was confirmed by FOXP3 gene mutation. The patient was referred to the hospital at the age of 3 years with recurrent emesis , diarrhoea<disease> and malnutrition. His elder brother died at 9 years of age from acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> and renal tubular acidosis. The patient was allergic to cow milk formula and noodles. Oesophagegastroduodenoscopy revealed redness , erosion and edema<symptom> throughout the stomach; whitish granules in the duodenal bulb; and edema<symptom> in the second part of the duodenum. Biopsies showed extensive villous atrophy and goblet cell depletion in the duodenum. He was diagnosed with type-1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM) during the treatment of methylprednisolone. Serum antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase and pancreatic islets were detected. The patient 's FOXP3 gene was sequenced; this identified that the patient was hemizygous for a pathogenic variant ( NM_014009.3: c. 748_750del ( p.Lys250del)). Metaplastic atrophic gastritis<disease> is rarely reported in patients with IPEX. Clinical gastroenterologists should be aware of IPEX syndrome<disease> when facing the complex syndromes<disease> of metaplastic atrophic gastritis<disease> and endocrinopathy.
