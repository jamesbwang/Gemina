  To investigate the DNA methylation profiles of immune response-related genes in apical periodontitis<disease> ( AP) lesions<symptom>. The methylation profiles on the cytosine-phosphate-guanine ( CpG) regions of 22 gene promoters involved in inflammation<symptom> and autoimmunity were assessed in 60 human AP lesions<symptom> and 24 healthy periodontal ligaments ( controls) using a pathway-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction array ( EpiTect ® Methyl Signature PCR Array Human Inflammatory Response). Differentially methylated genes were subsequently assessed for their mRNA expression. Data analyses ( One-way anova , Tukey 's multiple comparisons tests and Mann-Whitney tests) were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 software. P values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Significant DNA hypermethylation was observed for CXCL3 and FADD gene promoters in AP lesions<symptom> when compared to control tissues ( P < 0.001) and among other genes ( P < 0.05). In contrast , IL12B and IL4R were associated with significant hypomethylation in comparison to other genes ( P < 0.05). IL12B , IL4R , CXCL3 and FADD had differential mRNA expression in AP lesions<symptom> and controls ( P < 0.001). Differential methylation profiles of immune response-related genes , such as FADD , CXCL3 , IL12B and IL4R , may have an influence on individual AP susceptibility and patient treatment outcomes , through their potential contributions to altered expression of disease-relevant genes. Methylation and/or genetic variations in additional genes may also contribute to the dynamics of AP development and should be considered in future studies.
