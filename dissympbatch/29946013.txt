  Anemia<symptom> after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> is common and potentially modifiable. Here , we first evaluate the effect of anemia<symptom> on neurological outcome and death and second , study the effects of packed red blood cell transfusion on outcome. A secondary analysis on 413 subjects in the CONSCIOUS-1 study ( Clazosentan to Overcome Neurological Ischemia and Infarction Occurring After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage<symptom>). Multivariable logistic regression identified independent risk factors for anemia<symptom> and determined the effect of anemia<symptom> on neurological outcome and death , while adjusting for selected covariates. Optimal predictive thresholds for hemoglobin levels were determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Finally , patients were pseudorandomized to transfusion using propensity score matching to study the effect of transfusions on outcome. Anemia<symptom> , defined as hemoglobin < 10 g/dL , was present in 5 % of patients at presentation , in 29 % of patients after aneurysm<disease> securing ( days 1-3) , and in 32 % of patients during the peak delayed cerebral ischemia risk period ( days 5-9). Anemia<symptom> after aneurysm<disease> securing ( odds ratio , 1.96; 95 % confidence interval , 1.07-3.59; P = 0.03) and during the delayed cerebral ischemia window ( odds ratio , 2.63; 95 % confidence interval , 1.46-4.76; P = 0.0014) was independently associated with poor neurological outcome. Anemia<symptom> postaneurysm securing ( odds ratio , 3.50; 95 % confidence interval , 1.15-10.62; P = 0.027) but not during the delayed cerebral ischemia window was associated with death. Using propensity score-matched cohorts , we found that transfusion of anemic patients did not improve long-term outcome ( P = 0.8) or mortality rates ( P = 0.9). Transfusion of patients with a hemoglobin concentration > 10 g/dL was associated with improved neurological outcomes ( odds ratio , 0.09; 95 % confidence interval , 0.002-0.72; P = 0.015) , with no differences in mortality. Anemia<symptom> after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> is associated with poor long-term neurological outcome and death. Transfusion of packed red blood cells is beneficial for patients who are not considerably anemic beforehand , suggesting further work needs to define the threshold but also the time period of anemia<symptom> that is sufficient and necessary to contribute to poor outcomes.
