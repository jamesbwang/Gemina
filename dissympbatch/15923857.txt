  Large and ulcerating skin tumors have become a rarity in the modern Western world. However , these conditions can cause serious life-threatening complications. The case of a 60-year-old male Caucasian patient is reported , who had suffered from an extensive basal cell carcinoma in the right shoulder region for several years. The patient kept the lesion<symptom> secret from his friends and family and delayed presentation to health care services. After an episode of tumor-related heavy bleeding , the patient was referred to our clinic and received a radical surgical tumor resection-followed by defect coverage with a latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap. An alternative treatment option that could be offered to the patient would have been a mutilating surgical procedure with an arm amputation. By using this plastic reconstructive surgical technique , the main function of the shoulder joint was conserved. The presented case demonstrates options for defect coverage of problematic wounds<disease> in anatomically complex body regions-like the shoulder-by using a functional reconstruction using myocutaneous flaps.
