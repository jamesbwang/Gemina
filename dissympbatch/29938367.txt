  Pathological nipple discharge ( PND) is associated with serious clinical and diagnostic issues. Fiberoductoscopy ( FDS) is a new diagnostic option in PND patients. This study summarizes our initial experience of FDS for the management of PND patients in a single center in Poland and assesses its safety. A total of 256 women with PND were included in this prospective , case-controlled , single-center study between 2006 and 2014. Of the 250 patients who underwent FDS , 154 had mammary duct lesions<symptom> and 96 had no visible lesions<symptom>. Subsequently , 129 patients with lesions<symptom> identified by FDS underwent microductectomy and the lesions<symptom> were pathologically evaluated. The mean duration of FDS examination was 17 min. The most frequent intraductal lesion<symptom> was amputation of a duct ( 35.1 %) , followed by circular narrowing or hyperplasia<disease> ( 22.7 %). Final histological findings were unremarkable in 11.6 % of cases , whereas mammary duct papilloma , duct ectasia , and ductal carcinoma in situ were detected in 71.3 , 10.9 , and 6.2 % of cases , respectively. FDS is an innovative method for visualizing intraductal mammary lesions<symptom> and allows accurate selection of mammary ducts with suspicious lesions<symptom> that require surgical removal in women with PND.
