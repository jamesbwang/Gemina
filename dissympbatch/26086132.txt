  Ectotherms choose the best thermal conditions to mount a successful immune response , a phenomenon known as behavioral fever<disease> The cumulative evidence suggests that behavioral fever<disease> impacts positively upon lymphocyte<symptom> proliferation , inflammatory cytokine expression , and other immune functions. In this study , we have explored how thermal choice during infection impacts upon underpinning molecular processes and how temperature increase is coupled to the immune response. Our results show that behavioral fever<disease> results in a widespread , plastic imprint on gene regulation , and lymphocyte<symptom> proliferation. We further explored the possible contribution of histone modification and identified global associations between temperature and histone changes that suggest epigenetic remodeling as a result of behavioral fever<disease> Together , these results highlight the critical importance of thermal choice in mobile ectotherms , particularly in response to an infection , and demonstrate the key role of epigenetic modification to orchestrate the thermocoupling of the immune response during behavioral
