  Chronic renal<symptom> failure<symptom> ( CRF) is often accompanied by increased oxidative stress and euthyroid sick syndrome<disease> ( ESS). The cause of ESS is unknown , and it is unknown whether there exists a link between oxidant stress and ESS in CRF patients. Therefore , we aim to investigate oxidative stress and type 1 deiodinase ( DIO1) expression , which plays the key role in the ESS in CRF patients. In-patients with CRF were divided into the two group: Group 1 is ESS patients consisting of 60 patients with low free triiodothyronine ( FT3) and Group 2 consisting of 60 patients with normal FT3. Group 3 consisted of 60 healthy volunteers recruited as controls. The baseline clinical parameters of patients were evaluated with standard routine methods in a clinical laboratory. Serum levels of 8-isoprostane and DIO1 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between oxidative stress , DIO1 and FT3. The concentrations of serum 8-Isoprostane in Group 1 and Group 2 were substantially higher than that of Group 3 ( p < 0.05) , however there was no significant difference between Group 1 and Group 2 ( p = 0.516). The serum DIO1 level was higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 and Group 3 ( p < 0.001). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that the DIO1 concentration and FT3 level were not associated with the concentration of serum 8-Isoprostane. CRF patients showed elevated oxidative stress. The CRF patients without ESS showed higher expression of DIO1 than patients with ESS and the control group. The concentration of serum 8-Isoprostane was not correlated with FT3 and DIO1 levels.
