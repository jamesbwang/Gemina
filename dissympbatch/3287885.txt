  Non-cardiac chest<symptom> pain<symptom> ( NCCP) is recurrent angina pectoris-like pain without evidence of coronary heart disease in conventional diagnostic evaluation. The prevalence of NCCP is up to 70 % and may be detected ( in this order) at all levels of the medical health care system ( general practitioner , emergency department , chest<symptom> pain<symptom> unit , coronary care). Reduction of quality of life due to NCCP is comparable , and partially even higher , to that caused by cardiac chest<symptom> pain<symptom>. Reasons for psychological strain are symptom recurrence in approximately 50 % , nonspecific diagnosis with resulting uncertainty , and insufficient integration of other medical disciplines in the diagnostic workup. The management of patients with chest<symptom> pain<symptom> has to be multidisciplinary because non-cardiac causes may be frequently encountered. Especially gastroenterological expertise is required since the cause of chest<symptom> pain<symptom> is gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD) in 50-60 % , hypercontractile esophageal motility disorders with nutcracker/jackhammer esophagus or diffuse esophageal spasm or achalasia in 15-18 % , and other esophageal alterations ( e.g. , infectious esophageal inflammation<symptom> , drug-induced ulcers<disease> , rings , webs , eosinophilic esophagitis) in 32-35 %. This review highlights the importance of regular interdisciplinary ward rounds and management of chest<symptom> pain<symptom> units.
