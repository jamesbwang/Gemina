  Avascular necrosis<symptom> ( AVN) of the talus can be a cause of significant disability and is a difficult problem to treat. The most common cause is a fracture of the talus. We have done a systematic review of the literature with the following aims: ( 1) identify and summarize the available evidence in literature for the treatment of talar AVN , ( 2) define the usefulness of radiological Hawkins sign and magnetic resonance imaging in early diagnosis , and ( 3) provide patient management guidelines. We searched MEDLINE and PUBMED using keywords and MESH terminology. The articles ' abstracts were read by two of the authors. Forty-one studies met the inclusion criteria of the 335 abstracts screened. The interventions of interest included hindfoot fusion , conservative measures , bone grafting , vascularized bone graft , core decompression , and talar replacement. All studies were of Level IV evidence. We looked to identify the study quality , imprecise and sparse data , reporting bias , and the quality of evidence. Based on the analysis of available literature , we make certain recommendations for managing patients of AVN talus depending on identified disease factors such as early or late presentation , extent of bone involvement , bone collapse , and presence or absence of arthritis<disease>. Early talar AVN seems best treated with protected weight bearing and possibly in combination with extracorporeal shock<symptom> wave therapy. If that fails , core decompression can be considered. Arthrodesis should be saved as a salvage procedure in late cases with arthritis<disease> and collapse , and a tibiotalocalcaneal fusion with bone grafting may be needed in cases of significant bone loss. Role of vascularized bone grafting is still not defined clearly and needs further investigation. Future prospective , randomized studies are necessary to guide the conservative and surgical management of talar AVN.
