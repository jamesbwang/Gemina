  To evaluate the incidence of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome<disease> ( OSAHS) , explore the structural changes in pharyngeal soft tissue underlying OSAHS development and analyze the correlation between hormone levels and pharyngeal soft tissue changes in patients with untreated acromegaly. Twenty-five patients with untreated acromegaly were prospectively enrolled. Pituitary hormones were tested , sellar magnetic resonance imaging was confirmed , overnight polysomnography was conducted , and upper airway computed tomography was performed on these patients. Patients with untreated acromegaly had a high incidence of OSAHS ( 52.0 % , 13/25). The average age of the patients with OSAHS was 12 years older than that of patients without OSAHS ( 47.0 ± 8.5 years vs. 35.1 ± 9.5 years , p = 0.003). The posterior pharyngeal<symptom> soft<disease> tissues were thicker in four different planes , including the planes of the soft palate , uvula , tongue and epiglottis ( p = 0.003 , 0.008 , 0.027 , and 0.003 , respectively) , and the soft palate ( p = 0.024) was more hypertrophic in patients with acromegaly presenting with OSAHS than patients without OSAHS. The posterior pharyngeal<symptom> wall thickness ( cm) positively correlated with the serum insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1) level ( ng/ml) in the planes of the soft palate ( slope = 0.001 , p = 0.006) and epiglottis ( slope = 0.002 , p = 0.039). OSAHS is a common complication in patients with untreated acromegaly , and advanced age is a risk factor. Posterior pharyngeal<symptom> soft<disease> tissue thickening and soft palate hypertrophy are structural changes underlying OSAHS development in patients with acromegaly. Higher IGF-1 levels predict an increase in the posterior pharyngeal<symptom> soft<disease> tissue thickness in patients with acromegaly.
