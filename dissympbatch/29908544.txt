  T cell exhaustion<symptom> is an immunosuppressive mechanism which occurs in chronic viral<disease> infections<disease> , solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Exhausted T cell has increased the expression of inhibitory receptors , and functional impairment. In this study , we investigated the expression from some of those inhibitory receptors being Programmed death 1 ( PD-1) , T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing molecules 3 ( TIM-3) and CD244 on T cells from Iranian acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) patients. Peripheral blood samples were collected from Iranian newly diagnosed AML patients and flow cytometric analysis was accomplished for cell surface expression of PD-1 , TIM-3 , and CD244 on T lymphocytes. Functionality and proliferation assay were done in the presence of anti-PD-1 and anti-CD244 blocking antibodies. Immunophenotyping of T cells showed a significant increase of PD-1 and CD244 expression on CD4 + and CD8 + T cells of AML patients. Whereas blockade of PD1 and CD244 increased the proliferation of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes of AML patients but IFN-Î³ production was not significantly increased. In conclusion , our data indicate that CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from AML patients appeared to be exhausted and blockade of some immune checkpoints can improve the proliferation of those cells.
