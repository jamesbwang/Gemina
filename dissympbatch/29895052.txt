  Nowadays whooping cough<symptom> ( pertussis<disease> represents one of the most prevalent vaccine-preventable diseases in Western countries; even more , it is currently on rise. In many countries , the use of acellular pertussis<disease> adult vaccine in combination with tetanus<disease> and diphtheria<disease> toxoids ( Tdap) is recommended for women during pregnancy to protect newborns in the first months of life , when they are too young to be vaccinated. In Italy , vaccination of women during the third trimester of pregnancy is included in the national immunization programme ( PNPV 2017-2019) , though up to now , this vaccination strategy has not been efficiently implemented. In view of the public health importance of pertussis<disease> , particularly in young infants , we undertook this review to summarise the existing evidence on immunogenicity , effectiveness , safety and uptake of pertussis<disease> vaccine in expectant mothers to protect newborns from pertussis<disease> There is an increasing evidence that supports the safety , immunogenicity and effectiveness of Triaxis ® e Boostrix ® pertussis<disease> vaccination during pregnancy to protect infants before they receive their primary immunisations. In particular , both vaccines showed 90 % effectiveness in the reduction of pertussis<disease> disease and hospitalization in newborns , with 95 % effectiveness in the reduction of deaths. In Italy , the implementation of antenatal vaccination against pertussis<disease> is needed to narrow the gap between the recommendation of the PNPV and the prevention strategies actually offered by the public health system. To reach a good level of vaccine coverage , providers ' recommendations are critical. Hence , extensive education of vaccine givers and all primary and secondary healthcare professionals who have any contact with pregnant women is needed.
