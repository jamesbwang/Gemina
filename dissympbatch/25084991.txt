  Recent studies have shown a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MSyn) in vegetarians ( VEG) despite the inconclusive evidence from others. To verify the association between diet and other lifestyle characteristics and the prevalence of MSyn , cardiovascular risk factors ( CRF) , and Framingham Risk Score ( FRS) in apparently healthy VEG and omnivorous ( OMN) men. In this cross-sectional study , 88 apparently healthy men ≥ 35 years , 44 VEG and 44 OMN , were assessed for anthropometric data , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , blood lipids , glucose , C-reactive protein ( CRP) and FRS. To test the association between lifestyle and MSyn , Student t test , chi-square test , and multiple logistic regression model were used. A significance level of 5 % was considered in all statistical analyses. Several CRF were significantly lower in VEG than in OMN: body mass index , systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , fasting serum total cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol , apolipoprotein b , glucose , and glycated hemoglobin ( all p < 0.05). The FRS mean was lower in VEG than in OMN ( 2.98 ± 3.7 vs 4.82 ± 4.8 , p = 0.029). The percentage of individuals with MSyn was higher among OMN than among VEG ( 52.3 vs. 15.9 %) ( p < 0.001). The OMN diet was associated with MSyn ( OR: 6.28 95 % CI 2.11-18.71) and alterations in most MSyn components in the multiple regression model independently of caloric intake , age and physical activity. The VEG diet was associated with lower CRF , FRS and percentage of individuals with MSyn.
