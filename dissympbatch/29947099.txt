  To compare the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin vs glimepiride as add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. This 52-week , multicentre , double-blind , active-controlled study ( NCT02471404) randomized ( 1:1:1) patients ( n = 939; HbA1c 7.5 % -10.5 %) on metformin monotherapy ( â‰¥ 1500 mg/day) to add-on dapagliflozin 10 mg , dapagliflozin 10 mg plus saxagliptin 5 mg , or glimepiride 1 to 6 mg ( titrated). The primary efficacy end point was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 52. Baseline mean age , diabetes duration and HbA1c were 58.4 years , 7.0 years and 8.3 % , respectively. Adjusted mean HbA1c change from baseline was -1.20 % with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin and -0.82 % with dapagliflozin , vs -0.99 % with glimepiride ( mean dose at Week 52 , 4.6 mg). Changes in body<symptom> weight ( -3.2 kg and -3.5 kg vs +1.8 kg) and systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP; -6.4 mm Hg and -5.6 mm Hg vs -1.6 mm Hg) were significantly greater with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin and dapagliflozin than with glimepiride. FPG decreased significantly with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin compared with glimepiride ( -2.1 mmol/L vs -1.5 mmol/L) and was similar with dapagliflozin ( -1.6 mmol/L) compared with glimepiride. Confirmed incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower with dapagliflozin regimens than with glimepiride ( 0 and 1 vs 13 patients) and fewer patients required rescue. Genital<disease> infections<disease> were more frequent with dapagliflozin; other AE profiles were similar. Dapagliflozin , saxagliptin and metformin improved glycaemic control compared with glimepiride plus metformin; add-on of dapagliflozin alone showed efficacy similar to that of glimepiride. Both dapagliflozin regimens decreased body<symptom> weight and SBP , with a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia compared with glimepiride.
