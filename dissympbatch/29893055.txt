  Cipatinib is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor against both EGFR and HER2/neu. This phase I trial was conducted to assess the safety , dose-limiting toxicities ( DLTs) , and maximum-tolerated dose of cipatinib in HER2-positive patients with advanced breast cancer. Eligible adults with advanced breast cancer were administered cipatinib 200 mg/day ( n = 3) as an initial dose , with escalating dosages of 400 mg ( n = 4) , 800 mg ( n = 2) , 1200 mg ( n = 3) , 1400 mg ( n = 3) , 1600 mg ( n = 3) , and 1800 mg ( n = 2) in 21 day cycles. DLTs were monitored until the end of cycle 2. Physical examinations , vital signs , blood sampling for hematology , clinical chemistry , and pharmacokinetics were performed throughout the trial. Of the 26 subjects enrolled , 23 completed the trial. A total of 143 adverse events ( AEs) were reported , of which 87 were associated with cipatinib treatment and comprised: neutropenia ( 38 %) , hypertriglyceridemia ( 15 %) , fatigue<symptom> ( 15 %) , nausea<symptom> ( 12 %) , fever<disease> ( 19 %) , and myocardial ischemia ( 19 %). Six AEs were graded 3-4 ( neutropenia , increases in aspartate aminotransferase , and total bilirubin , fatigue<symptom> , dizziness<symptom> and nodal tachycardia<symptom>) , but none of the AEs observed were considered to be DLTs. This tolerability study revealed that despite a mild toxicity profile , cipatinib was well tolerated up to the anticipated maximum dosage of 1800 mg/m
