  Hemolytic-uremic<disease> syndrome<disease> ( HUS) is defined as the triad of nonimmune hemolytic<symptom> anemia<symptom> , thrombocytopenia<symptom> , and acute<symptom> renal<symptom> failure<symptom> , in which the underlying lesions<symptom> are mediated by systemic thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA). The atypical HUS ( aHUS) can be considered a subtype of HUS that is rare in childhood and has a worse prognosis. Recent findings have established that the TMA in aHUS are consequences of the disregulation of the complement activation , leading to endotelial damage mediated by the complement terminal pathway .1 , 2 Likewise , previous research suggests an important role for the deregulation of the alternative complement cascade in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) .3 , 4 We report the case of a patient with ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) who developed aHUS during a flare-up of her chronic<disease> disease<disease>. This association is extremely infrequent and had been previously reported in only 1 patient .5.
