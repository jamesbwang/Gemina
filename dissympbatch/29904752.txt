  One-step self-etch adhesives are among the most popular adhesives to directly bond composite to tooth tissue , mainly because of their perceived ease-of-use. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the clinical performance of a HEMA-free 1-step self-etch adhesive ( 1SEa) , as compared with a 3-step etch-and-rinse adhesive ( 3E & Ra). 267 non-carious cervical<symptom> lesions<symptom> in 52 patients were restored with a microhybrid composite Gradia Direct ( GC) , bonded in random order either with the HEMA-free 1SEa G-Bond ( GB; GC) or the considered gold-standard 3E & Ra Optibond FL ( OFL; Kerr). The restorations were evaluated after 6 months , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 and 9 years of clinical service for retention , marginal adaptation , marginal discoloration , caries<disease> occurrence and tooth sensitivity. Statistical analysis was done using a logistic regression model with generalized estimating equations ( 2-way GEE model). The patient recall rate at 9 years was 82.6 %. The overall clinical success rate was 80.3 % and 79.5 % for GB and OFL , respectively. In total , 47 restorations ( 23 GB , 24 OFL) failed because of retention loss , severe marginal defects and/or discoloration and/or caries<disease>. A similar retention rate of 89.7 % was recorded for both adhesives GB and OFL. Slight marginal defects and superficial marginal discoloration , though both still clinically acceptable , were significantly more observed at the incisal enamel side of GB ( 92.4 % and 52.1 % , respectively) than OFL ( 59.6 %; 30.8 %) restorations ( p < 0.05). After 9 years of clinical service , class-V restorations bonded with the HEMA-free 1SEa performed clinically equally successful as those bonded with the 3E & Ra. However , more marginal deterioration , though still clinically acceptable , was recorded at the incisal enamel side for the 1SEa.
