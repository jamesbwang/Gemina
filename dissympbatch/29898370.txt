  Normal hematopoiesis is sustained through a carefully orchestrated balance<symptom> between hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC) self-renewal and differentiation. The functional importance of this axis is underscored by the severity of disease phenotypes initiated by abnormal HSC function , including myelodysplastic syndromes<disease> and hematopoietic malignancies. Major advances in the understanding of transcriptional regulation of primitive hematopoietic cells have been achieved , however , the post-transcriptional regulatory layer that may impinge on their behavior remains underexplored by comparison. Key players at this level include RNA binding proteins ( RBPs) , which execute precise and highly coordinated control of gene expression through modulation of RNA properties that include its splicing , polyadenylation , localization , degradation or translation. With the recent identification of RBPs having essential roles in regulating proliferation and cell fate decisions in other systems , there has been an increasing appreciation of the importance of post-transcriptional control at the stem cell level. Here we discuss our current understanding of RBP-driven post-transcriptional regulation in HSC , its implications for normal , perturbed and malignant hematopoiesis , as well as the most recent technological innovations aimed at RBP-RNA network characterization at the systems level. Emerging evidence highlights RBP-driven control as an underappreciated feature of primitive hematopoiesis , the greater understanding of which has important clinical implications.
