  Stereoelectroencephalography-guided radiofrequency thermocoagulation ( SEEG-guided RF-TC) is a super-selective procedure. Hippocampus has a limited volume and is widely accessible to SEEG so that SEEG-guided RF-TC could be an alternative to the anterior temporal lobectomy ( ATL) in case of temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE) syndrome<disease>. To compare seizure-free rate at 1-year follow-up between patients undergoing SEEG-guided RF-TC and patients undergoing ATL in TLE over a 15-year period. All patients had a drug-resistant epilepsy and underwent SEEG after non-conclusive phase I investigations suspecting a TLE. Two groups were selected according to the procedure which the patients underwent ( ATL or SEEG-guided RF-TC); TLE had to be confirmed by SEEG in the two groups. The primary outcome was seizure<symptom> freedom at 1 year. The secondary outcome was response ( at least 50 % reduction of seizure<symptom> frequency) at 1 year. In case of persistent seizures<symptom> after SEEG-guided RF-TC , ATL was performed. A total of 21 patients underwent SEEG-guided RF-TC and 49 ATL. At 12 months , none of the patients of the SEEG-guide RF-TC group was seizure<symptom> free , while 37 ( 75.5 %) in the ATL group were so ( p < 0.001). Ten patients ( 47.6 %) were responders after 12 months of follow-up after SEEG-guided RF-TC; all patients in the ATL group who were seizure<symptom> free were responders. SEEG-guided RF-TC is not as effective as ATL in TLE. As no memory<symptom> impairment<symptom> following SEEG-guided RF-TC was found , patients with dominant mesial involvement for whom hippocampectomy is not an option could benefit from the technique.
