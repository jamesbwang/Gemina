  Filariasis<disease> is traditionally diagnosed on finding microfilaria in peripheral blood smear and in cases of occult filariasis<disease> by immunological tests. Clinically , it presents with a wide range of symptoms and signs. We present two cases of filariasis<disease> presenting with renal symptoms warranting kidney biopsy. Histopathology of both revealed microfilaria in the glomerular capillary loop. First case was a 23-year-old male who presented with complaints of passage of milky urine. Second case was a 36-year-old female patient who presented with complaints of gross hematuria<symptom>. Urine examination revealed nephrotic range proteinuria<symptom> in both patients. Subsequently they underwent guided kidney biopsy for the evaluation of nephrotic range protienuria. Histopathology of both revealed microfilaria in the glomerular capillary loop. However , neither of the two cases showed proliferative changes in the glomeruli. To conclude , diagnosis of filariasis<disease> on kidney biopsy by identifying microfilaria is very rare. High index of suspicion is required to diagnose filariasis<disease> due to its wide range of clinical presentation and laboratory findings.
