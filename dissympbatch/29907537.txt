  Giardiasis is one of the most common gastrointestinal<disease> infections<disease> of humans and animals attributable to complex of eight morphologically identical genetic assemblages , further divided into sub-assemblages. Disease is common for a wide range of hosts and genetic characterization is needed for better understanding of multifaceted epidemiology for this protozoan parasite. The aim of this study was to identify genetic heterogeneity in assemblages and sub-assemblages of Giardiaduodenalis circulating among the children population living in deprived socioeconomic conditions. A total of 333 stool<symptom> samples from children in eastern Slovakia were collected during the period of 2015-2016 and analysed by molecular methods. Molecular characterization of G. duodenalis was performed by sequence analysis of triose phosphate isomerase gene ( tpi) and glutamate dehydrogenase gene ( gdh). G. duodenalis DNA was detected in 21 samples ( 6.3 %) , out of which 14 isolates ( 66.7 %) belonged to assemblage B , 4 isolates ( 19.0 %) to sub-assemblage AII and 3 isolates ( 14.3 %) corresponded to assemblage F. As regards the determination of sub-assemblages of assemblage B , 4 isolates were characterized as sub-assemblage BIII and 6 isolates as sub-assemblage BIV. This study is the first finding of cat specific assemblage F in man not only in Slovakia , but also in Europe. The absence of molecular data about G. duodenalis in companion animals in Slovakia establishes a strong need for further investigation for potential sources of giardiasis and understanding the epidemiology will help to improve the preventive strategies in eradication of infection in this population.
