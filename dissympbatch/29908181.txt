  Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ( PPARγ) , a ligand activated nuclear transcription factor , is constitutively expressed in alveolar macrophages of healthy individuals. PPARγ deficiencies have been noted in several lung diseases including the alveolar macrophages of pulmonary sarcoidosis patients. We have previously described a murine model of multiwall carbon nanotubes ( MWCNT) induced pulmonary<symptom> granulomatous<symptom> inflammation<symptom> which bears striking similarities to pulmonary sarcoidosis , including the deficiency of alveolar macrophage PPARγ. Further studies demonstrate alveolar macrophage PPARγ deficiency exacerbates MWCNT-induced pulmonary granulomas<disease>. Based on these observations we hypothesized that activation of PPARγ via administration of the PPARγ-specific ligand rosiglitazone would limit MWCNT-induced granuloma<disease> formation and promote PPARγ-dependent pathways. Results presented here show that rosiglitazone significantly limits the frequency and severity of MWCNT-induced pulmonary granulomas<disease>. Furthermore , rosiglitazone attenuates alveolar macrophage NF-κB activity and downregulates the expression of the pro-inflammatory mediators , CCL2 and osteopontin. PPARγ activation via rosiglitazone also prevents the MWCNT-induced deficiency of PPARγ-regulated ATP-binding cassette lipid transporter-G1 ( ABCG1) expression. ABCG1 is crucial to pulmonary lipid homeostasis. ABCG1 deficiency results in lipid accumulation which promotes pro-inflammatory macrophage activation. Our results indicate that restoration of homeostatic ABCG1 levels by rosiglitazone correlates with both reduced pulmonary lipid accumulation , and decreased alveolar macrophage activation. These data confirm and further support our previous observations that PPARγ pathways are critical in regulating MWCNT-induced
