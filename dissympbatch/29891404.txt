  Seasonal influenza-associated neurological complications had high mortality and morbidity rates in recent studies. We reported influenza-associated encephalitis/encephalopathy in children during 2014-2017 in Taiwan , focusing on neurological presentations , neuroimaging correlations , and critical care managements. During January 1st 2014 to June 30th 2017 , pediatric patients reported to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control surveillance system for severe complicated influenza<disease> infections in the hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Children with influenza-associated encephalitis/encephalopathy were inspected for clinical presentations , laboratory data , neuroimaging studies , treatment modalities , and neurological outcomes. Ten children with median age 5.9 years were enrolled for analysis. Influenza-associated encephalitis/encephalopathy appeared in the spring and summer , with a delayed peak comparing with the occurrence of pneumonia<disease> and septic shock<symptom>. The neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom> developed rapidly within median 1 day after the first fever<disease> episode. All patients had consciousness<symptom> disturbance. Seven patients ( 70 %) had seizures<symptom> at initial presentation , and six of them had status epilepticus. Anti-viral treatments were applied in all patients , with median door-to-drug time 0.9 h for oseltamivir and 6.0 h for peramivir. Multi-modality treatments also included steroid pulse therapy , immunoglobulin treatment , and target temperature management , with 85.2 % of the major treatments administered within 12 h after admission. Nine of the ten patients recovered without neurological sequelae. Only one patient had epilepsy requiring long-term anticonvulsants and concomitant cognitive decline. In highly prevalent area , influenza-associated encephalitis/encephalopathy should be considered irrespective of seasons. Our study suggested the effects of timely surveillance and multi-modality treatments in influenza-associated encephalitis/encephalopathy.
