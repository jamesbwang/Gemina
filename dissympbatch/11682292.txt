  Primary pulmonary angiosarcoma is a rare disease. Here , we report the case of primary pulmonary angiosarcoma diagnosed computed tomographic pulmonary angiography ( CTPA) and discuss its specific imaging characteristics. A 46-year-old man was admitted for cough<symptom> and shortness of breath. Thoracic CTPA images demonstrated a high-attenuation lesion<symptom> surrounding by a halo sign in upper lobe of right lung , and the dilated vessel was also seen in lower lobe of right lung. The sign of `` hillside sign '' was observed on CTPA. It was diagnosed with primary pulmonary angiosarcoma. Right thoracotomy and right upper lobe lobectomy were performed. Five years later , the patient dead of complete occlusion of the pulmonary artery owing to tumor recurrence. Although primary pulmonary angiosarcoma is a rare disease with atypical early clinical symptoms , and it is often misdiagnosed as pulmonary embolism and pulmonary<disease> infection<disease> Therefore , it is important to recognize the CTPA imaging characteristics of primary pulmonary angiosarcoma and Surgical resection should be performed to prolong the patients ' lifetime.
