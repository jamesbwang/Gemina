  Anderson-Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene that result in deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. The worldwide incidence of Fabry 's disease is reported to be in the range of 1 in 40,000-117,000 , although this value may be a significant underestimate given under recognition of symptoms and delayed or missed diagnosis. Deficiency in alpha-galactosidase A causes an accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids such as globotriaosylceramide ( Gb3) in lysosomes within various tissues including the vascular endothelium , kidneys , heart , eyes , skin and nervous system. Gb3 accumulation induces pathology via the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines , growth-promoting factors and by oxidative stress , resulting in myocardial extracellular matrix remodelling , left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH) , vascular dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis<disease>. Cardiac involvement manifesting as ventricular hypertrophy , systolic and diastolic dysfunction , valvular abnormalities and conduction tissue disease is common in AFD and is associated with considerable cardiovascular morbidity and mortality from heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , sudden cardiac death and stroke-related death.
