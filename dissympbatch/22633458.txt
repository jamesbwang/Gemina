  Activated platelets release micromolar concentrations of the chemokine CXCL4/Platelet Factor-4. Deposition of CXCL4 onto the vascular endothelium is involved in atherosclerosis , facilitating monocyte arrest and recruitment by an as yet , unidentified receptor. Here , we demonstrate that CXCL4 drives chemotaxis of the monocytic cell line THP-1. Migration and intracellular calcium responses induced by CXCL4 were pertussis<disease> toxin-sensitive , implicating a GPCR in signal transduction. Cell treatment with chondroitinase ABC ablated migration , suggesting that cis presentation of CXCL4 by cell surface glycosaminoglycans to a GPCR is required. Although CXCR3 has been previously described as a CXCL4 receptor , THP-1 cells were unresponsive to CXCR3 ligands and CXCL4-induced migration was insensitive to a CXCR3 antagonist , suggesting that an alternative receptor is involved. Interrogating CC-class chemokine receptor transfectants , we unexpectedly found that CXCL4 could induce the migration of CCR1-expressing cells and also induce CCR1 endocytosis. Extending our findings to primary human monocytes , we observed that CXCL4 induced CCR1 endocytosis and could induce monocyte chemotaxis in a CCR1 antagonist-sensitive manner. Collectively , our data identify CCR1 as a previously elusive monocyte CXCL4 receptor and suggest that CCR1 may play a role in inflammation<symptom> where the release of CXCL4 is implicated.
