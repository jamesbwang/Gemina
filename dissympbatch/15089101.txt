  Chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> including migraine is associated with structural and functional changes in the somatosensory cortex. Previous reports proposed two-point discrimination ( TPD) as a measurement for cortical alterations. Limited evidence exists for tactile acuity in the neck and no data is available for migraine. To introduce a standardized protocol for the measurement of TPD in the upper cervical spine , 51 healthy participants were investigated with a newly developed paradigm which was evaluated for intra-rater reliability. The same protocol was applied by two further examiners to 28 migraine patients and 21 age- , and gender-matched healthy controls to investigate inter-rater reliability and between group differences. Results indicated excellent intra-rater ( right ICC Surprisingly , migraine patients showed increased TPD thresholds in the upper cervical spine interictally. Although a body of evidence supports that hypersensitivity<disease> is part of the migraine attack , the current report indicates that interictally , migraine patients showed worse tactile acuity similar to other chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> populations. This has been hypothesized to indicate structural and functional re-organisation of the somatosensory cortex.
