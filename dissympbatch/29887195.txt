  Acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( AHF) accounts for a significant number of emergency department ( ED) visits , and the disease may present along a spectrum with a variety of syndromes<disease>. This review evaluates several misconceptions concerning heart<symptom> failure<symptom> evaluation and management in the ED , followed by several pearls. AHF is a heterogeneous syndrome<disease> with a variety of presentations. Physicians often rely on natriuretic peptides , but the evidence behind their use is controversial , and these should not be used in isolation. Chest radiograph is often considered the most reliable imaging test , but bedside ultrasound ( US) provides a more sensitive and specific evaluation for AHF. Diuretics are a foundation of AHF management , but in pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> , these medications should only be provided after vasodilator administration , such as nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin administered in high doses for pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> is safe and effective in reducing the need for intensive care unit admission. Though classically dopamine is the first vasopressor utilized in patients with hypotensive cardiogenic shock<symptom> , norepinephrine is associated with improved outcomes and lower mortality. Disposition is complex in patients with AHF , and risk stratification tools in conjunction with other assessments allow physicians to discharge patients safely with follow up. A variety of misconceptions surround the evaluation and management of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> including clinical assessment , natriuretic peptide use , chest radiograph and US use , nitroglycerin and diuretics , vasopressor choice , and disposition. This review evaluates these misconceptions while providing physicians with updates in evaluation and management of AHF.
