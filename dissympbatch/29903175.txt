  To study the prevalence and family factors on metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MS) in children and adolescents for Chongqing City. Multi-stage cluster sampling was used to recruit 1309 children and adolescents between 10 and 17 years old for physical examination ( height , weight , waist circumference and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>) , blood biochemical examination ( fasting plasma glucose , triglyceride , total cholesterol , high density lipoprotein cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol) and questionnaire for family factors ( breast feeding , delivery mode , birth weight , education of parents , height and weight of parents , family history of hypertension and diabetes , and so on). MS was diagnosed by the definition of metabolic syndrome<disease> and prophylaxis and treatment proposal in Chinese children and adolescents. The prevalence of MS on children and adolescents in Chongqing city was 5. 5 % , and among normal weight , overweight , and obese groups were 0. 6 % , 13. 8 % and 41. 2 % , respectively. Univariate analysis showed BMI of father ( χ ~ 2 = 8. 237 , P = 0. 016) , BMI of mother ( χ ~ 2 = 8. 978 , P = 0. 011) , occupation of father ( χ ~ 2 = 7. 742 , P = 0. 021) , occupation of mother ( χ ~ 2 = 6. 578 , P = 0. 037) and family history of hypertension ( χ ~ 2 = 7. 684 , P = 0. 006) were associated with MS. Logistic regression analysis showed father 's overweight ( OR = 1. 956 , 95 % CI 1. 176-3. 254) , mother 's obesity ( OR = 2. 934 , 95 % CI 1. 230-6. 999) and family history of hypertension ( OR = 1. 867 , 95 % CI 1. 139-3. 059) were risk factors for MS.
