  Empty follicle syndrome<disease> ( EFS) is a disorder associated with female infertility<symptom> and presents as a complete failure to retrieve oocytes during ART cycles despite normal follicle development and careful aspiration. To date , only two EFS cases have been reported with homozygous missense mutations in the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor ( LHCGR) gene , and both cases showed normal estradiol ( E2) production during ovulation induction. The molecular genetic mechanisms of EFS remain unknown. Herein , we report two novel homozygous inactivating LHCGR mutations , c. 736 C > T ( p.Q246 *) and c. 846dupT ( p.R283 *) , in two female EFS patients from unrelated consanguineous families. The probands had impaired E2 production during the ART process , which differs from previously reported EFS cases. The inactivating mutations not only led to EFS in the two female probands , but also resulted in 46 , XY disorder of sex development ( 46 , XY DSD) in their male siblings. As far as we know , this is the first report of LHCGR mutations leading to both EFS and 46 , XY DSD within the same pedigree. Our findings provide researchers and clinicians with a better understanding of phenotype-genotype correlations between EFS and 46 , XY DSD and the LHCGR gene.
