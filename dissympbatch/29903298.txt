  To explore the relationship between abdominal obesity and dyslipidemia in postmenopausal women. Based on the project of 2014 community comprehensive intervention for prevention of chronic<disease> diseases<disease> in Suzhou Industrial Park , 2 000 residents in a community were randomly selected. Among them , a total of 323 women with natural menopause for more than 12 months were observed. Height , body<symptom> weight , waist circumference , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and plasma levels of triglycerides ( TG) level , total cholesterol ( TC) level , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) level and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C) were measured. Abdominal obesity was diagnosed by waist circumference ( â‰¥ 85 cm) according to Criteria of Weight for Adults. Hyperglycemia was diagnosed by TG , TC , HDL-C and LDL-C in Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Dyslipidemia in Chinese Adults ( 2007). Relationship between abdominal obesity and dyslipidemia was analyzed by Logistic regressionmethod. The incidences of abdominal obesity and dyslipidemia were13. 6 % ( 44/323) and 29. 7 % ( 96/323) , respectively. The rate of dyslipidemia was significantly higher in abdominal obesity group than in the control group ( 43. 2 % vs27. 6 % , P = 0. 036). Waist circumference was positively correlated with TG ( r = 0. 28 , P < 0. 01) and LDL-C ( r = 0. 20 , P < 0. 01) , and negatively correlated with HDL-C ( r = -0. 26 , P < 0. 01). The multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that abdominal obesity had significantly increased risk of dyslipidemia ( OR = 2. 07 , 95 % CI 1. 04-4. 13 , P = 0. 039). The OR for TG and HDL-C were 3. 81 ( 95 % CI 1. 69-8. 60 , P = 0. 001) and 3. 19 ( 95 % CI 1. 36-7. 52 , P = 0. 008) , respectively. Abdominal obesity is likely to be a risk factor for dyslipidemia in postmenopausal women.
