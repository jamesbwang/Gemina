  Left atrial ( LA) fibrosis<disease> promotes atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) , may predict poor radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA) outcome , and may be assessed invasively using electroanatomical mapping ( EAM). Speckle tracking echocardiography ( STE) enables quantitative assessment of LA function. The aim was to assess the relationship between LA fibrosis<disease> derived from EAM and LA echocardiographic parameters as well as biomarkers of fibrosis<disease> in patients with AF. Sixty-six patients ( 64 % males , mean age 56 ± 10) with nonvalvular AF treated with first RFCA were prospectively studied. Seventy-three percent of patients were in sinus rhythm at the time of examination. LA geometry , systolic , and diastolic function were assessed. In STE global , peak atrial longitudinal ( PALS) and contractile ( PACS) strain were calculated. LA stiffness index ( LAs)- the ratio of E/e ' to PALS- was assessed. The EAM of LA was build using Carto System before RFCA. Low amplitude potentials area ( LAPA) was quantitatively analyzed and expressed as a percentage of LA surface using the cut-off < 0.5 mV to detect potential sites of fibrosis<disease>. The serum concentrations of MMP-9 , PIIINP , and TGFβ1were estimated before RFCA. Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between LA diastolic function parameters: PALS ( -0.54 , P < .001) , LAs ( 0.65 , P < .001) , and LAPA in patients who were in sinus rhythm. Also LA volume significantly correlated with LAPA ( 0.44 , P < .002). None of biomarkers correlated with LAPA. Left atrial diastolic parameters derived from STE correlate well with the extent of LA fibrosis<disease>. Thus , STE may be useful in the noninvasive assessment of LA fibrosis<disease> and selection of candidates for RFCA.
