  Propofol infusion syndrome<disease> ( PRIS) is a rare syndrome<disease> originally described in critically ill children undergoing long-term ( > 48 h) propofol infusion at high doses ( > 4 mg/kg/h). Severe metabolic acidosis , rhabdomyolysis , renal<symptom> failure<symptom> and fatal cardiac failure are the features. Herein , we present a case of a newborn who developed PRIS after a single bolus dose of propofol at 3.2 mg/kg/do , developing rhabdomyolysis and severe metabolic acidosis , with a successful outcome after medical therapy.
