  Mesalazine is a drug routinely used in ulcerative colitis<disease> and usually has few side effects. There have been reports of uncommon cases of severe mucocutaneous damage , such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome<disease> ( SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN) , induced by salicylates. It is important to diagnose these promptly due to the high morbidity and mortality rates. We describe the case of a 46-year-old female with ulcerative proctitis<disease> , who developed SJS following topical mesalazine use. The lesions<symptom> responded well to intravenous corticosteroids after discontinuation of the drug.
