  Vascular pineal malformations are rare and technically demanding lesions<symptom>. Because the locations of these lesions<symptom> , endovascular techniques and radiosurgery have been increasingly used in the recent decades to accomplish safe occlusion. Nevertheless , microsurgical treatment may be required sometimes. We present a retrospective review of the vascular pineal malformations operated by the senior author. Moreover , we report illustrative cases for the various types of vascular lesions<symptom> with a careful analysis of the different microsurgical stages. Eighteen patients with pineal vascular lesions<symptom> were operated on between 1980 and 2015: 6 patients had vein of Galen malformations , 5 plexiform arteriovenous malformations , 6 cavernous malformations , and 1 patient had a ruptured medial posterior choroidal artery aneurysm<disease>. A complete resection and occlusion was possible in all vascular malformations. The pineal region is an infrequent but challenging location for vascular lesions<symptom>. A careful and stepwise operative strategy for the different types of vascular lesion<symptom> is paramount to accomplish an effective and safe microsurgical treatment when other alternatives fail or are not available.
