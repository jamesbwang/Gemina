  Immune thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( ITP) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease characterized by low platelet count that has been associated with a number of chronic<disease> infections<disease> but rarely described as a manifestation of Whipple 's disease ( WD). We present a case of Whipple 's disease in a patient initially diagnosed with ITP. A 46-year old male in the fifth decade of life presented with presumed idiopathic ITP and was treated with several therapies including corticosteroids , rituximab , and thrombopoietin receptor agonists. Several years later , he developed weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and worsening arthralgias.

His diagnosis of WD , as a cause of secondary ITP , came a full 8 years after he was discovered to have thrombocytopenia<symptom> and over 4 years after he was diagnosed with ITP. WD is an uncommon , multiorgan system disease caused by the actinomycete
