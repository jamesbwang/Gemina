  Daptomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic approved for treatment of gram-positive skin and soft<disease> tissue<disease> infections<disease> We present a case of an 89-year-old man who presented with fever<disease> , shortness of breath and nonproductive cough<symptom> on week 4 of starting daptomycin for infective endocarditis<disease> Computerized tomography scan showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates predominantly affecting the lower lobes. He also had peripheral eosinophilia of 6 %. He was diagnosed with eosinophilic pneumonia<disease> secondary to daptomycin use. His symptoms improved with discontinuation of daptomycin and initiation of corticosteroids. Clinical correlation of pneumonia-like presentation with recent use of daptomycin should make physicians rule out this rare adverse effect for early institution of correct treatment.
