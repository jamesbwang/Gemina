  Background Few studies have examined persistent pain after reduction mammaplasty , and sensory<symptom> changes<symptom> remain a controversial subject with studies reporting both reduced , improved , and unchanged skin sensitivity following surgery. The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence , character , and impact of sensory<symptom> changes<symptom> and persistent pain following breast reduction surgery and to assess possible causes and predictors of persistent sensory<symptom> changes<symptom> and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Methods In May 2010 , a detailed questionnaire was mailed to all 109 patients who underwent reduction mammaplasty at the Department of Plastic Surgery , Aalborg Hospital from September 2004 to February 2010. Ninety patients ( 83 %) returned the questionnaire; mean age was 48.7 years ( SD 14.7); and mean time since surgery was 27.7 months. Results Eight patients reported that they had sensory abnormalities in the breasts<disease> before surgery , which normalized or improved in four , remained unchanged in one , and worsened in three patients following surgery. Forty-nine patients ( 54 %) reported sensory<symptom> changes<symptom> in the nipple-areola complex or skin as a consequence of surgery. Sixty-nine patients reported having pain before surgery ( most often in the neck/back) , which was completely relieved in 42 % and partially in 43 %. Twenty-five patients ( 28 %) reported having pain in the breasts<disease> as a consequence of the operation: 20 % had chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> ( defined as constant pain or pain at least once weekly for at least 3 months) and 7 % had moderate to severe<symptom> pain<symptom>. In more than half of the patients , the pain was compatible with neuropathic pain. Patients with pain tended to be less satisfied with the surgery than those without pain ( p = 0.07 , Mann-Whitney U test). Young age , time since surgery , complications to surgery and sensory abnormalities before surgery were significantly related to pain. Conclusion Reduction mammaplasty relieved neck and back pain in most patients , but the surgery is associated with a risk of developing new sensory abnormalities and persistent neuropatic pain. Implications The clinical implication of this study is that reduction mammaplasty may sooth preexisting neck- and back pain , but may lead to a new condition in the patient with chronic sensory<symptom> changes<symptom> and pain in the
