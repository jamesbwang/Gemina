  Kawasaki disease shock<symptom> syndrome<disease> ( KDSS) is an uncommon presentation of Kawasaki disease ( KD). KDSS has been associated with more severe markers of inflammation<symptom> , coronary abnormalities and IVIG resistance. A retrospective , descriptive study of children with KDSS in two hospitals was performed. Relevant articles about KD and shock<symptom> were collected , demographic data , clinical presentation , laboratory variables , echocardiogram findings , treatment and special features were analyzed when available. Twelve patients diagnosed with KDSS were retrospectively reviewed from two centers in Mexico , along with 91 additional cases from the literature. Sixty patients presented with complete KD ( 68 %) , and 45.6 % ( 45/103) of the patients had unusual KD manifestations. The most frequent diagnosis at the time of admission was toxic shock<symptom> syndrome<disease> ( TSS) ( 20 patients). Sixteen of them presented coronary artery abnormalities. Overall , abnormalities in the coronary arteries were documented in 72.8 % of the patients. The mortality rate was 6.8 %. The presence of coronary aneurysms<disease> showed a statistically significant positive correlation with male gender , IVIG-resistance , inotropic treatment , cardiac failure , abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and neurological manifestations. IVIG-resistant patients showed higher values of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR). Abdominal manifestations , hypoalbuminemia and elevated CRP are constant findings. Multisystemic involvement with atypical presentation in KDSS is frequent. An important differential diagnosis is TSS. Mechanical ventilation , gastrointestinal and neurological manifestations were associated with IVIG-resistance and the presence of coronary aneurysms<disease>. The first line of treatment includes IVIG and corticosteroids in pulses , and in severe cases infliximab , anakinra , cyclosporine or plasmapheresis are alternative treatment options.
