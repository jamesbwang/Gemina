  Liver fibrosis<disease> is a health challenge requiring alternative therapeutic approaches. Cilostazol is a selective phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor and possesses antioxidant , anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties. Sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1) is a member of the silent information regulator 2 family. Cilostazol upregulates SIRT1 expression. Cilostazol protects against the cholestatic liver insults caused by bile duct obstruction. Involvement of SIRT1 pathway in this protective effect has not been studied yet. So , we hypothesized that SIRT1 signaling may have a role in cilostazol protective effects against bile duct ligation-induced liver damages. Rats were subjected to common bile duct ligation then treated with cilostazol ( 9 mg/kg or 27 mg/kg) in the presence or absence of specific SIRT1 inhibitor EX527. Cilostazol improved liver function , reduced inflammation<symptom> , enhanced antioxidant status , ameliorated cholestatic liver injury and upregulated hepatic SIRT1. However , these protective effects were abrogated by EX527 , suggesting that SIRT1 signaling may have a role in these effects. In conclusion , cilostazol in a dose-dependent way produced hepatoprotective effects via anti-inflammatory , antioxidant , antifibrotic effects which were mediated , in part , through SIRT1 upregulation.
