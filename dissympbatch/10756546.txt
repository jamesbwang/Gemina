  Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> is a highly prevalent cardiac arrhythmia and the most important cause of embolic stroke. Although genetic studies have identified an increasing assembly of AF-related genes , the impact of these genetic discoveries is yet to be realized. In addition , despite more than a century of research and speculation , the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying AF have not been established , and therapy for AF , particularly persistent AF , remains suboptimal. Current antiarrhythmic drugs are associated with a significant rate of adverse events , particularly proarrhythmia , which may explain why many highly symptomatic AF patients are not receiving any rhythm control therapy. This review focuses on recent advances in AF research , including its epidemiology , genetics , and pathophysiological mechanisms. We then discuss the status of antiarrhythmic drug therapy for AF today , reviewing molecular mechanisms , and the possible clinical use of some of the new atrial-selective antifibrillatory agents , as well as drugs that target atrial remodeling , inflammation<symptom> and fibrosis<disease> , which are being tested as upstream therapies to prevent AF perpetuation. Altogether , the objective is to highlight the magnitude and endemic dimension of AF , which requires a significant effort to develop new and effective antiarrhythmic drugs , but also improve AF prevention and treatment of risk factors that are associated with AF complications.
