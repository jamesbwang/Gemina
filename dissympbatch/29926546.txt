  Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL) is a necessary procedure for diagnosis of various lung diseases. High-flow nasal cannula ( HFNC) oxygen delivery was recently introduced. This study aimed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of HFNC oxygen supply during BAL procedure in patients with acute<disease> respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> ( ARF). Patients who underwent BAL while using HFNC at a partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen ( PaO ₂/ FiO ₂; PF) ratio of 300 or below among patients who had been admitted from March 2013 to May 2017 were retrospectively investigated. Thirty-three BAL procedures were confirmed. Their baseline PF ratio was 166.1 ± 46.7. FiO ₂ values before , during , and after BAL were 0.45 ± 0.12 , 0.74 ± 0.19 , and 0.57 ± 0.14 , respectively. Flow ( L/min) values before , during , and after BAL were 26.5 ± 20.3 , 49.0 ± 7.2 , and 40.8 ± 14.2 , respectively. Both FiO ₂ and flow during and after the procedure were significantly different from those before the procedure ( both p < 0.001). Oxygen saturation levels before , during , and after BAL measured by pulse oximeter were 94.8 ± 2.9 , 94.6 ± 3.5 , and 95.2 ± 2.8 % , respectively. There were no significant differences in oxygen saturation among the three groups. Complications of BAL procedure included transient hypoxemia<symptom> , hypotension<symptom> , and fever<disease> However , there was no endotracheal intubation within 24 hours. Baseline PF ratio in `` without HFNC '' group was significantly higher than that in `` with HFNC '' group. There were no differences in complications between the two groups. The use of HFNC during BAL procedure in ARF patients was effective and safe. However , there were no significant differences in oxygen saturation level and complications comparing `` without HFNC '' group in mild ARF. More studies are needed for moderate to severe ARF patients.
