  22q11 .2 microduplication is a relatively recently recognized syndrome<disease>. Findings in affected individuals range from apparent normality to a wide variety of systemic and ocular conditions. We describe the association between 22q11 .2 microduplication and juvenile glaucoma in two brothers. We reviewed ophthalmological , genetic , and hematological medical records of two patients and their unaffected mother. A 2.07 Mb interstitial duplication in 22q11 .21 and a smaller 182 kb duplication in 22q11 .23 were identified in both subjects. Patient 1 showed an initial intraocular pressure ( IOP) of 15 mmHg in right eye ( RE) and 32 mmHg in left eye ( LE) under maximum medical treatment. Deep sclerectomy surgery in LE was converted to trabeculectomy due to a macroperforation of the trabeculo-descemetic membrane. Postoperatively , the patient developed persistent hypotony with retinal folds , while IOP in RE increased to 28 mmHg. Trabeculectomy in RE was also complicated by persistent hypotony. Autologous blood<symptom> injection<symptom> was performed , resulting in an increase in both visual acuity and IOP. Patient 2 presented with an IOP of 29 mmHg in RE and 33 mmHg in LE. We planned an elective trabeculectomy and added orally administered acetazolamide. The patient developed bilinear cytopenia<symptom> that contraindicated the surgical procedure. After hematologic normalization , the patient underwent trabeculectomy in LE , causing persistent hypotony. We performed deep sclerectomy surgery in RE , without any significant intra- or post-operative complications. 22q11 .2 microduplication syndrome<disease> can be associated with juvenile glaucoma. Trabeculectomy may be complicated by persistent hypotony. Deep sclerectomy appears to be a better surgical option , although the presence of a thin sclera<symptom> may result in conversion to trabeculectomy.
