  Dental pulp is a highly vascularized and innervated tissue that provides sensitivity and vitality to the tooth. Chronic caries<disease> results in an infected pulp tissue prone to necrosis<symptom>. Existing clinical treatments replace the living pulp tissue with a non-responsive resin filling resulting in loss of tooth vitality. Tissue engineering approaches to dental pulp tissue regeneration have been investigated to preserve tooth vitality and function. However , a critical criterion is the choice of growth factors that may promote mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and more importantly , vascularization. But , the problems associated with growth factor dosage , delivery , safety , immunological and ectopic complications affect their translatory potential severely. The purpose of this study is to develop , characterize and evaluate a biomimetic native extracellular matrix ( ECM) derived dual ECM scaffold that consists of a pulp-specific ECM to promote MSC attachment , proliferation and differentiation and an endothelial ECM to promote migration of host endothelial cells and eventual vascularization
