  A 52-year-old woman diagnosed with mycosis<disease> fungoides was referred for F-FDG PET/CT before treatment for the evaluation of disease severity. The patient also underwent Ga-pentixafor PET/CT for further evaluation. FDG uptake was observed in cervical , axillary , and pelvic lymph nodes and multiple widespread skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> throughout the body , suggestive of extensive involvement of mycosis<disease> fungoides. All lesions<symptom> were visually identifiable with high target-to-background ratio on Ga-pentixafor PET/CT which demonstrated marked CXCR4 expression in all lesions<symptom> that were detected using F-FDG PET/CT.
