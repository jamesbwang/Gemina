  Purpose To evaluate the sensitivity , specificity , and diagnostic odds ratios of US , CT , and MRI as second-line imaging modalities after initial US for assessing acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> in children and adults. Materials and Methods A literature search was conducted in Medline and Embase to identify articles that used surgery or histopathologic examination alone or in combination with clinical follow-up or chart review to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of second-line imaging modalities. The quality of articles was assessed by using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 and the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy tools. Results For studies of children , the number of studies and patients were as follows: US , six studies and 548 patients; CT , nine studies and 1498 patients; MRI , five studies and 287 patients. For studies of adults , the number of studies and patients were as follows: US , three studies and 169 patients; CT , 11 studies and 1027 patients; MRI , six studies and 427 patients. Pooled sensitivities and specificities of second-line US for diagnosis of appendicitis<disease> in children were 91.3 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 83.8 % , 95.5 %) and 95.2 % ( 95 % CI: 91.8 % , 97.3 %) , respectively; and in adults , the pooled sensitivities and specificities were 83.1 % ( 95 % CI: 70.3 % , 91.1 %) and 90.9 % ( 95 % CI: 59.3 % , 98.6 %) , respectively. Regarding second-line CT in children , the pooled sensitivities and specificities were 96.2 % ( 95 % CI: 93.2 % , 97.8 %) and 94.6 % ( 95 % CI: 92.8 % , 95.9 %); and in adults , the pooled sensitivities and specificities were 89.9 % ( 95 % CI: 85.4 % , 93.2 %) and 93.6 % ( 95 % CI: 91.2 % , 95.3 %) , respectively. Regarding second-line MRI in children , pooled sensitivities and specificities were 97.4 % ( 95 % CI: 85.8 % , 100 %) and 97.1 % ( 95 % CI: 92.1 % , 99.0 %); and in adults , the pooled sensitivities and specificities were 89.9 % ( 95 % CI: 84.8 % , 93.5 %) and 93.6 % ( 95 % CI: 90.9 % , 95.5 %) , respectively. Conclusion Second-line US , CT , and MRI have comparable and high accuracy in helping to diagnose appendicitis<disease> in children and adults , including pregnant women. All three modalities may be valid as second-line imaging in a clinical imaging pathway for diagnosis and management of
