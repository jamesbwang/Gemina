  To develop and validate the first patient-reported outcome measure ( PROM) to quantify vision-related dizziness<symptom>. Dizziness<symptom> is a common , multifactorial syndrome<disease> that causes reductions in quality of life and is a major risk factor for falls , but the role of vision is not well understood. Potential domains and items were identified by literature review and discussions with experts and patients to form a pilot PROM , which was completed by 335 patients with dizziness<symptom>. Rasch analysis was used to determine the items with good psychometric properties to include in a final PROM , to check undimensionality , differential item functioning , and to convert ordinal questionnaire data into continuous interval data. Validation of the final 25-item instrument was determined by its convergent validity , patient , and item-separation reliability and unidimensionality using data from 223 patients plus test-retest repeatability from 79 patients. 120 items were originally identified , then subsequently reduced to 46 to form a pilot PROM. Rasch analysis was used to reduce the number of items to 25 to produce the vision-related dizziness<symptom> or VRD-25. Two subscales of VRD-12-frequency and VRD-13-severity were shown to be unidimensional , with good psychometric properties. Convergent validity was shown by moderately good correlations with the Dizziness<symptom> Handicap Inventory ( VRD-25 is the only PROM developed to date to assess vision-related dizziness<symptom>. It has been developed using Rasch analysis and provides a PROM for this under-researched area and for clinical trials of interventions to reduce vision-related
