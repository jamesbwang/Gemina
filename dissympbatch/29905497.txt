  Epstein-Barr virus-associated smooth-muscle tumors are rare tumors seen in immunocompromised patients. Most cases occur in the context of AIDS and organ transplantation , and very rarely in the setting of congenital immunodeficiency , with only 5 case reports of the latter published so far in the literature. The authors report the case of a previously healthy 8-year-old girl with headaches<symptom> and precocious puberty who was found to have a large skull base lesion<symptom>. There was a synchronous left adrenal lesion<symptom>. She underwent resection of the skull base lesion<symptom> and a left adrenalectomy. Thorough evaluation for immunodeficiency was negative for a known congenital immunodeficiency<disease> syndrome<disease>. She had a short course of intravenous immunoglobulin and has had no recurrence of disease or new lesions<symptom> in the 17 months since presentation. Continued surveillance for the development of opportunistic infections and new or recurrent lesions<symptom> is warranted in this case. Repeat surgery for surgically accessible tumors or chemoradiation would be recommended for any additional
