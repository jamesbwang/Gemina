  Psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> with dramatic responses to TNF-α inhibitors. TNF-α is mainly produced by macrophages. However , how macrophage polarization contributes to psoriasis remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of macrophage polarization in psoriasis. 8 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis ( Male/Female: 4/4 , average age: 47.9 years old) and 8 healthy controls ( Male/Female: 4/4 , average age: 49.3 years old) were recruited. Their peripheral CD14 + monocytes were isolated with magnetic beads and then were differentiated into macrophages. The differential macrophage polarization was compared among normal controls , psoriatic patients before and after TNF-α inhibitors. The U937 cells were used to investigate the mechanisms by which TNF-α altered the macrophage polarization. The ratio of M1 to M2a macrophage polarization was higher in psoriatic patients comparing with that in controls. The decreasing M1/M2a ratio was parallel to decreasing PASI severity score after adalimumab treatment. Consistently , TNF-α blockage decreased M1/M2a ratio in U937 cells. The induction of STAT1 and IRF-1 in polarized U937 M1 cells was inhibited by TNF-α inhibitor. However , STAT1 and/or IRF-1 interference could not resume M1 polarization. In skin , the increased M1 and M2 infiltration in lesions<symptom> returned to baseline after successful treatment with TNF-α inhibitor. Increased M1 polarization is associated with higher disease severity in psoriasis , resuming to baseline after successful treatment by TNF-α inhibitors. TNF-α blockage inhibits M1 polarization through STAT1- and IRF-1-independent pathways. Macrophage polarization may contribute to disease progression in psoriasis.
