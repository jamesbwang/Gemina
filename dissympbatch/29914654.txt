  Some studies indicate that noncomplicated acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> might be treated exclusively with antibiotics instead of an appendectomy. This study was undertaken to assess outcomes in elderly veterans and to determine if operative intervention would lead to substantial complications such that a nonoperative strategy should be investigated. A retrospective , single-institution analysis was conducted of patients who underwent an appendectomy at the VA North Texas Health Care System over a period of 12 years ( from July 2005 to June 2017). Patients who underwent an appendectomy for cancer , interval appendectomy , exploratory laparotomy for perforated appendicitis<disease> , or appendectomy as part of another major operation were excluded from the study. Patients were then grouped as elderly ( ≥ 60 years old) and young ( < 60 years old) , and differences in outcome were assessed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were also performed to determine if age and comorbid conditions were independent predictors of complications in both cohorts. Of patients who underwent an appendectomy for acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> ( n = 257 , male = 90.7 % , age = 45.4 ± standard deviation 15.6 years , body mass index = 30.3 ± 6.3 kg/m
