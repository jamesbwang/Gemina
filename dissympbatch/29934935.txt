  Immune dysregulation is a defining feature of myelodysplastic syndromes<disease> ( MDS). Recently , several studies have further defined the complex role of immune alterations within MDS. Herein , we will summarize some of these findings and discuss the therapeutic strategies currently in development. Immune alterations in MDS are complex , heterogeneous , and intertwined with clonal hematopoiesis and stromal cell dysfunction. Inflammation<symptom> in MDS proceeds as a vicious cycle , mediated in large part by secreted factors , which induce cell death and activate innate immune signaling. Therapeutic targeting of this variable immune dysregulation has led to modest responses thus far , but incorporation of the growing repertoire of immunotherapy brings new potential for improved outcomes. The immune milieu is variable across the spectrum of MDS subtypes , with a changing balance<symptom> of inflammatory and suppressive cellular forces from low- to high-risk disease.
