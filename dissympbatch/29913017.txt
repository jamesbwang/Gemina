  Aggregated α-synuclein is believed to be central to the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease ( PD). PRX002/RG7935 ( PRX002) is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to target aggregated forms of α-synuclein , thereby inhibiting neuron-to-neuron transfer of presumed pathogenic forms of α-synuclein , potentially resulting in neuronal protection and slowing disease progression. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple intravenous infusions of PRX002 in patients with idiopathic PD. Multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multiple ascending-dose trial at 8 US study centers from July 2014 to September 2016. Eligible participants were aged 40 to 80 years with mild to moderate idiopathic PD ( Hoehn and Yahr stages 1-3). Participants were enrolled into 6 ascending-dose cohorts and randomly assigned to receive PRX002 ( 0.3 mg/kg , 1.0 mg/kg , 3.0 mg/kg , 10 mg/kg , 30 mg/kg , or 60 mg/kg) or placebo. Participants received 3 intravenous infusions every 4 weeks of PRX002 or placebo and were monitored during a 24-week observational period. Safety and tolerability assessments included physical and neurological examinations , laboratory tests , vital signs , and adverse events. Pharmacokinetic parameters included maximum PRX002 concentration , area under the curve , and half-life. Of the 80 participants , most were white ( 97.5 %; n = 78) and male ( 80 %; n = 64); median ( SD) age was 58 ( 8.4) years. PRX002 was generally safe and well tolerated; no serious or severe PRX002-related treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) were reported. The TEAEs experienced by at least 5 % of patients receiving PRX002 , irrespective of relatedness to study drug , were constipation<symptom> ( 9.1 %; n = 5) , infusion reaction ( 7.3 %; n = 4) , diarrhea<disease> ( 5.5 %; n = 3) , headache<symptom> ( 5.5 %; n = 3) , peripheral edema<symptom> ( 5.5 %; n = 3) , post-lumbar puncture syndrome<disease> ( 5.5 %; n = 3) , and upper respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( 5.5 %; n = 3). No antidrug antibodies were detected. Serum PRX002 levels increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner; mean terminal elimination half-life was similar across all doses ( 10.2 days). Rapid dose- and time-dependent mean reductions from baseline vs placebo in free serum α-synuclein levels of up to 97 % were seen after a single infusion at the highest dose ( F78 ,284 = 1.66; P = .002) , with similar reductions after 2 additional infusions. Mean cerebrospinal fluid PRX002 concentration increased with PRX002 dose and was approximately 0.3 % relative to serum across all dose cohorts. Single and multiple doses of PRX002 were generally safe and well tolerated and resulted in robust binding of peripheral α-synuclein and dose-dependent increases of PRX002 in cerebrospinal fluid , reaching cerebrospinal fluid concentrations that may be expected to engage extracellular aggregated α-synuclein in the brain. Findings support the design of an ongoing phase 2 clinical study ( NCT03100149). ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02157714.
