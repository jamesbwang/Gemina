  There is great variation in cytopenias<symptom> in cirrhotic patients with same severity and hypersplenism and their causative factors are not clear. Recent studies have highlighted the role of gut microbiome in regulation of constant and emergency hematopoiesis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics can disrupt the homeostatic or adaptive microbiota in cirrhosis , leading to impaired hematopoiesis and a higher susceptibility to infections. We studied all patients with cirrhosis with cytopenia<symptom> ( anemia<symptom> , leucopenia , and/or thrombocytopenia<symptom>) , admitted in the Institute of Liver & Biliary Sciences , between January 2016 and July 2017 , who underwent a bone<disease> marrow examination. The effect of the different antimicrobial agents on peripheral blood counts and bone<disease> marrow cellularity was assessed. A total of 196 patients ' data was analyzed for this study. Patients on antimicrobials (
