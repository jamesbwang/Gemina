  The aim of this study was to describe maternal and fetal outcomes after pregnancy complicated by peripartum cardiomyopathy ( PPCM). We included women that had subsequent pregnancy ( SSP) after PPCM and assessed maternal prognosis and pregnancy outcomes , in-hospital up to one week after discharge. Clinical and echocardiographic data were collected comparing alive and deceased women. Factors associated with pregnancy outcomes were assessed. Twenty-nine patients were included , with a mean age of 26.7 ± 4.6 years and a mean gravidity number of 2.3 ± 0.5 of. At the last medical control before subsequent pregnancy , there was no congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , the mean left ventricular diastolic diameter ( LVDD) was 53 ± 4 mm and the left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) was ≥ 50 % in 13 cases ( 44.8 %). Maternal outcomes were marked by 14 deaths ( 48.3 %). Among the factors tested in univariate analysis , LVEF at admission had an excellent receiver-operating characteristic ( ROC) curve to predict maternal mortality ( AUC = 0.95; 95 % CI 0.87-1 , p < 0.001) , with a cut off value of < 40 % ( sensitivity = 93 % and specificity = 87 %). Concerning fetal outcomes , baseline LVEF had the best area under the curve ( AUC) to predict abortion<disease> or prematurity among all variables ( AUC = 0.75; 95 % CI 0.58-092 , p = 0.003) , with a cut-off value of < 50 % ( sensitivity = 79 % , specificity = 67 %). SSP outcomes are still severe in our practice. Maternal mortality remains high and is linked to ventricular systolic function at admission ( due to pregnancy) , while fetal outcomes are linked to baseline LVEF before pregnancy.
