  In this study , we evaluated the ovicidal and larvicidal activity of protein preparations obtained from Cassia fistula<disease> L. and Combretum leprosum Mart. leaves on the gastrointestinal parasites of goats. Protein preparations were obtained after the extraction of C. fistula<disease> L. and C. leprosum Mart. leaves , followed by protein fractionation ( with ammonium sulfate saturation percentages of 30 % , 30 % -60 % , and 60 % -90 %) and dialysis , which resulted in protein fractions ( called F1 , F2 , and F3 , respectively). The fractions were evaluated by egg hatching ( the eggs were recovered in stool<symptom> samples from naturally infected goats) and larval development tests. The results reveled that the inhibition of hatching of eggs caused by the protein fractions of C. fistula<disease> ( 38 %) were similar to that of the control drug , thiabendazole. In addition , the fractions of C. fistula<disease> caused significant inhibition ( 61-69 %) of larval development also. However , C. leprosum did not reveal significant inhibition of egg hatching and larval development. We conclude that C. fistula<disease> L. showed better ovicidal and larvicidal activity against endoparasites.
