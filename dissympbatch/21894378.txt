  Parasitic eosinophilic meningitis<disease> is rarely observed in infants. The diagnosis of this disease is complicated by its atypical and severe clinical manifestations. An infant presented to our hospital with high fever<disease> and irritability<symptom> , as well as refusal to walk. Cerebrospinal fluid collected through lumbar puncture showed increased eosinophil count and third-stage Angiostrongylus cantonensis larvae. Eosinophilic meningitis<disease> was suspected. We started empiric treatment with levamisole ( 14 mg bid , 2.5 mg/kg · day) and prednisone ( 17.5 mg qd , 1.5 mg/kg · day). All of the infant 's symptoms were resolved approximately 72 hours after treatment. The patient fully recovered from her illness after completing 4 weeks of levamisole and prednisolone treatment. A. cantonensis is the most common cause of parasitic eosinophilic meningitis<disease> cases in Southeast Asia. Physicians treating infants who live in areas where A. cantonensis is endemic and who present with irritability<symptom> , abnormal motor function , and elevated eosinophil count should be aware of the disease to provide timely and rational therapy to the patients.
