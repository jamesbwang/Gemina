  Copper homeostasis can be altered by inflammation<symptom>. This study aimed to investigate the alteration of serum copper homeostasis and to explore its clinical significance in patients with chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> ( CHB). Thirty-two patients with CHB and 10 aged- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. Analyses included serum levels of total copper ( TCu) , copper ions ( Cu) , small molecule copper ( SMC) , ceruloplasmin ( CP) , Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 ( SOD1) , urinary copper , and the activities of serum CP and SOD1.The serum TCu and urinary copper levels in patients with CHB were significantly higher than the controls ( P = .04 and .003) , while the serum Cu was lower than the controls ( P = .0002). CP and SOD1 activities in the serum were significantly lower in patients with CHB compared to controls ( P = .005) despite higher serum concentrations. In addition , serum alanine aminotransferase inversely correlated with serum CP activity ( P = .0318 , r = -0.4065). Serum copper homeostasis was altered in this cohort of patients with CHB. The results suggest increased oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant capability in patients with CHB , in addition to necroinflammation. These results may provide novel insights into the diagnosis and treatment of patients with CHB.
