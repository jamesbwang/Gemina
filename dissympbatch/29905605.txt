  Frey syndrome<disease> is one of the important complications of parotid<symptom> surgery. Placing a barrier between the parotid<symptom> gland and the skin flap is considered to be effective for preventing this syndrome<disease> by blocking misdirected regeneration of nerve fibers. Neoveil is nonwoven polyglycolic acid ( PGA) felt that is used as absorbable reinforcing material. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of this PGA felt as a barrier for preventing Frey syndrome<disease>. A total of 19 patients who underwent superficial parotidectomy from 2012 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Application of PGA felt ( n = 9) or sternocleidomastoid flap ( SCMF) transfer ( n = 10) was performed to prevent Frey syndrome<disease>. The total operating time , intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , operating time after parotidectomy , and postoperative drainage volume were compared between the 2 groups. The operating time after parotidectomy was significantly shorter in the PGA felt group than in the SCMF group ( 43.7 ± 10.7 vs 57.8 ± 15.7 minutes). The total operative time was shorter and the drainage volume was smaller in the PGA felt group than those in the SCMF group without statistical significance ( 210.1 ± 43.4 vs 234.3 ± 52.7 minutes and 80.6 ± 36.8 vs 118.8 ± 83.9 mL). Neither Frey syndrome<disease> nor other major complications occurred in either group. Use of PGA felt successfully prevented Frey syndrome<disease> , while being technically simpler and more rapid compared with SCMF transfer.
