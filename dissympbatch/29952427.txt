  The differentiation of cystic lesions<symptom> located in the sellar-suprasellar region is a significant problem in clinical practice because of the similarities in their clinical , radiological , and even histopathological picture. Arriving at the right diagnosis is vital for taking appropriate therapeutic decisions. The most frequent clinical manifestation of lesions<symptom> located in the sellar-suprasellar region is headache<symptom> It often co-exists with symptoms of anterior pituitary gland insufficiency or hyperprolactinaemia caused by compression of the pituitary stalk. Diabetes insipidus , obe-sity , mental disorders , and circadian rhythm disorders may be associated with lesions<symptom> penetrating the suprasellar space. It is extremely important to rule out the possible coexistence of pituitary microadenoma and Rathke 's cleft cyst<symptom> , which became possible with the use of ยนยน C-methionine positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( C-MET PET/CT). Reports from literature indicate that pituitary microadenoma may coexist with Rathke 's cleft cyst<symptom> in 10 % of patients. Cystic lesions<symptom> of the sellar-suprasellar region should also be differentiated from a cystic pituitary adenoma or abscess<disease> The first-choice therapy in symptomatic cystic lesions<symptom> of the sellar-suprasellar region is neurosurgery , which usually relieves headache<symptom> and improves vision impairment , while less frequently restores normal pituitary function. In suprasellar lesions<symptom> , neurosurgery may trig-ger or aggravate pre-existing symptoms of damage to the hypothalamus. Patients undergoing neurosurgery for cystic lesions<symptom> located in the sellar-suprasellar region should be monitored for a few years due to their high recurrence rate , potential malignant transformation of these lesions<symptom> , and possible adenoma development through metaplasia. The advent of targeted therapy of the BRAF/MEK pathway is associated with new therapeutic opportunities for patients with craniopharyngiomas.
