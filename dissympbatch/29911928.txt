  Sterile alpha motif and HD domain-containing protein 1 ( SAMHD1) is a mammalian dNTP hydrolase that acts as a negative regulator in the efficacy of cytarabine treatment against acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML). However , the role of SAMHD1 in AML development and progression remains unknown. We have reported that SAMHD1 knockout ( KO) in the AML-derived THP-1 cells results in enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis , but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we show that SAMHD1 KO in THP-1 cells increased PI3K activity and reduced expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K activity reduced cell proliferation specifically in SAMHD1 KO cells , suggesting that SAMHD1 KO-induced cell proliferation is mediated via enhanced PI3K signaling. However , PI3K inhibition did not significantly affect SAMHD1 KO-reduced apoptosis , implicating the involvement of additional mechanisms. SAMHD1 KO also led to enhanced phosphorylation of p27 at residue T157 and its mis-localization to the cytoplasm. Inhibition of PI3K activity reversed these effects , indicating that SAMHD1 KO-induced changes in p27 phosphorylation and localization is mediated via PI3K-Akt signaling. While SAMHD1 KO significantly enhanced THP-1 cell migration in vitro , SAMHD1 KO attenuated the ability of THP-1 cells to form subcutaneous tumors in xenografted immunodeficient mice. This effect correlated with significantly increased expression of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α ( TNF-α) in tumors , which may suggest that TNF-α-mediated inflammation<symptom> could account for the decreased tumorigenicity in vivo. Our findings implicate that SAMHD1 can regulate AML cell proliferation via modulation of the PI3K-Akt-p27 signaling axis , and that SAMHD1 may affect tumorigenicity by downregulating
