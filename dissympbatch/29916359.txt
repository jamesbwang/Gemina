  Although foreign body ingestion is a common occurrence , perforation and penetration of the gastrointestinal tract is unusual and the development of a hepatic<symptom> abscess<symptom> is even more rare. The authors describe two cases of fish bone perforation of the gastrointestinal tract with hepatic perforation and abscess<disease> formation , from distinctive age groups and varying presentation , although both developed septic shock<symptom>. The lack of history of ingestion of foreign bodies , non-specificity of both clinical presentation and complementary examinations all play a role in delaying the diagnosis and therefore in the prognosis itself.
