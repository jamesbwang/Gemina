  This data depicts the clinical evaluation of collagen membrane in oral mucosal defects due to oral submucous fibrosis<disease> and leukoplakia. This data comprised of 10 patients in the age group of 20-60 ( 3 male and 2 female patients with grade III and grade IV oral submucous fibrosis<disease> and 5 male patients with oral leukoplakia with a size of 3-5 cm in diameter). The parameters such as pain , swelling , allergy , biodegradability of collagen membrane , degree of re-epithelisation , degree of contracture , mouth<symptom> opening and wound<disease> size were assessed after the placement of collagen membrane in oral mucosal defects. There is less data regarding the usage of collagen membrane as a biological dressing material to cover mucosal defects ( Rastogi et al. , 2009) ( 1).
