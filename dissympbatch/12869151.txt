  Nevus lipomatosis cutaneous superficialis ( NLCS) is a rare hamartoma of mature adipose tissue characterized by solitary or multiple , soft , skin-colored or yellowish lobules that may coalesce to give rise to plaques with a cerebriform surface. There are two clinical types: ( 1) multiple lesions<symptom> that are usually presented in a segmental distribution and ( 2) a solitary papule or nodule<disease>. To study the clinical and histopathological features of 5 Saudi patients with NLCS. A retrospective analysis of clinical data and histopathological findings of 5 cases of NLCS in King Khalid University Hospital between January 2011 and November 2016. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the clinical case files. Slides and tissue blocks were retrieved. H&E- and EVG-stained slides were studied in all cases. We identified 5 patients with NLCS , of whom 4 were female. The average age at diagnosis was 36 years. The mean duration of the lesion<symptom> was 4.4 years. The most common location was the lower part of the body. Most of the cases were diagnosed as skin papilloma before skin biopsy. Surgical excision was effective and no recurrence was observed. This is the first study about this rare type of skin tumor in Saudi Arabia and highlights the need for awareness of this clinical condition among dermatologists.
