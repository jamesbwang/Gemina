  Depression<symptom> is common in schizophrenia and associated with negative outcomes. Previous studies have identified heterogeneity in treatment response in schizophrenia. We aimed to investigate different trajectories of depression<symptom> in patients suffering from psychosis and predictors of change in depressive symptoms during antipsychotic treatment. Two hundred and twenty-six patients > 18 years acutely admitted due to psychosis were consecutively included and the follow-up was 27 weeks. The Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia ( CDSS) sum score was the primary outcome. Latent growth curve ( LGCM) and Growth Mixture Models ( GMM) were conducted. Predictors were the Positive sum score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome<disease> Scale for Schizophrenia ( PANSS) , Schizophrenia spectrum/non-spectrum psychoses , gender and being antipsychotic naive at inclusion. We found support for three depression-trajectories , including a high- ( 14.7 %) , a low depression-level ( 69.6 %) class and a third depressed class quickly decreasing to a low level ( 15.7 %). Change in CDSS was associated with change in PANSS positive score in all time intervals ( 4 weeks: b = 0.18 , p < 0.001 , 3 months: 0.21 , p < 0.023 , 6 months: 0.43 , p < 0.001) and with a diagnosis within schizophrenia spectrum but not with antipsychotic naivety or gender. The schizophrenia-spectrum patients had less depressive symptoms at inclusion ( -2.63 , p < 0.001). In conclusion , an early responding and a treatment refractory group were identified. The treatment-refractory patients are candidates for enhanced anti-depressive treatment , for which current evidence is limited. The post-psychotic depression<symptom> group was characterized by depressive symptoms in the acute phase as well. We could not identify differentiating characteristics of the depression<symptom> trajectories.
