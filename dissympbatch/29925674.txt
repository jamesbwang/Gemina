  Improved biomass cookstoves may help reduce the substantial global burden of morbidity and mortality due to household air pollution ( HAP) that disproportionately affects women and children in low and middle income countries ( LMICs). Systematic review and meta-analysis of ( quasi-) experimental studies identified from 13 electronic databases ( last update: 6 April 2018) , reference and citation searches and via expert consultation. LMICs PARTICIPANTS: Women and children INTERVENTIONS: Improved biomass cookstoves MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( LBW) , preterm birth , perinatal mortality , paediatric acute<disease> respiratory<disease> infections<disease> ( ARIs) and COPD among women. We identiÔ¨Åed 53 eligible studies , including 24 that met prespecified design criteria. Improved cookstoves had no demonstrable impact on paediatric lower ARIs ( three studies; 11560 children; incidence rate ratio ( IRR) = 1.02 ( 95 % CI 0.84 to 1.24)) , severe pneumonia<disease> ( two studies; 11061 children; IRR = 0.88 ( 95 % CI 0.39 to 2.01)) , LBW ( one study; 174 babies; OR = 0.74 ( 95 % CI 0.33 to 1.66)) or miscarriages , stillbirths<symptom> and infant mortality ( one study; 1176 babies; risk ratio ( RR) change = 15 % ( 95 % CI -13 to 43)). No ( quasi-) experimental studies assessed preterm birth or COPD. In observational studies , improved cookstoves were associated with a significant reduction in COPD among women: two studies , 9757 participants; RR = 0.74 ( 95 % CI 0.61 to 0.90). Reductions in cough<symptom> ( four studies , 1779 participants; RR = 0.72 ( 95 % CI 0.60 to 0.87)) , phlegm<symptom> ( four studies , 1779 participants; RR = 0.65 ( 95 % CI 0.52 to 0.80)) , wheezing/breathing difficulty ( four studies; 1779 participants; RR = 0.41 ( 95 % CI 0.29 to 0.59)) and conjunctivitis<disease> ( three studies , 892 participants; RR = 0.58 ( 95 % CI 0.43 to 0.78)) were observed among women. Improved cookstoves provide respiratory and ocular symptom reduction and may reduce COPD risk among women , but had no demonstrable child health impact. PROSPERO: CRD42016033075.
