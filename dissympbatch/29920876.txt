  This cohort study aimed to investigate the association between irritable bowel syndrome<disease> ( IBS) and the risk of developing psychiatric disorders. Utilizing the National Health Insurance Research Database ( NHIRD) of Taiwan , IBS patients were identified and compared with age , sex , and index year-matched controls ( 1:3). Of the IBS subjects , 3934 in 22 356 ( 17.60 % , or 1533.68 per 100 000 person-years) developed psychiatric disorders when compared with 6127 in 67 068 ( 9.14 % , or 802 per 100 000 person-years) in the non-IBS control group. Fine and Gray 's survival analysis revealed that the study subjects were more likely to develop psychiatric disorders. The crude hazard ratio ( HR) is 3.767 ( 95 % CI: 3.614-3.925 , P < .001) , and the adjusted HR is 3.598 ( 95 % CI: 3.452-3.752 , P < .001) in the risk of developing psychiatric disorders after being adjusted for age , sex , comorbidities , geographical area of residence , urbanisation level of residence , and monthly insurance premiums. The cohort study revealed that IBS subjects were associated with an increased risk of anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> , bipolar , and sleep disorders. This cohort study , using NHIRD , shows evidence support that patients with IBS have a 3.6-fold risk of developing psychiatric disorders. Other large or national datasets should be done to explore to underlying mechanisms.
