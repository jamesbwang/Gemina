  Detection of lung nodules<symptom> is critical in CAD systems; this is because of their similar contrast with other structures and low density , which result in the generation of numerous false positives ( FPs). Therefore , this study proposes a methodology to reduce the FP number using a deep learning technique in conjunction with an evolutionary technique. The particle swarm optimization ( PSO) algorithm was used to optimize the network hyperparameters in the convolutional neural network ( CNN) in order to enhance the network performance and eliminate the requirement of manual search. The methodology was tested on computed tomography ( CT) scans from the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative ( LIDC-IDRI) with the highest accuracy of 97.62 % , sensitivity of 92.20 % , specificity of 98.64 % , and area under the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve of 0.955. The results demonstrate the high performance-potential of the PSO algorithm in the identification of optimal CNN hyperparameters for lung nodule<disease> candidate classification into nodules<symptom> and non-nodules , increasing the sensitivity rates in the FP reduction step of CAD systems.
