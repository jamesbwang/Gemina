  Eysenhardtia polystachya is used for the empirical treatment of cancer , infections , diarrhea<disease> , inflammation<symptom> , and pain. This study identified , using GC-MS , the main chemical components in an ethanol extract of E. polystachya branches and leaves ( EPE) and tested its cytotoxic , antimicrobial , anti-diarrheal , anti-inflammatory , and antinociceptive effects. The in vitro and in vivo toxicity of EPE was evaluated using the comet assay in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC) and the acute toxicity test in mice , respectively. The cytotoxic and the antimicrobial effects were performed using the MTT assay and the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC) test , respectively. The levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated macrophages were measured to evaluate the in vitro anti-inflammatory effects of EPE. The antidiarrheal ( castor oil test , small intestine transit , and castor oil-induced enteropooling) , and anti-inflammatory activities ( TPA and carrageenan) of EPE were also performed. The antinociceptive actions of EPE were carried out with the following tests: acetic acid , formalin , and hot plate. The hypnotic and locomotor effects were analyzed using pentobarbital and a rotarod system , respectively. The main component in EPE was D-pinitol ( 26.93 %). The antidiarrheal and antinociceptive effects of D-pinitol were also evaluated. EPE showed low in vitro toxicity ( DNA damage in PBMC at concentrations higher than 200 Âµg/ml) , and low in vivo toxicity ( LD
