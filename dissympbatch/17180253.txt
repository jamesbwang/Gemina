  Postoperative duodenal-cutaneous fistula<disease> represents a rare and very complex problem. In most cases operative management becomes necessary , but only after local and systemic stabilization and sepsis<disease> control. A 39-year-old man was admitted for surgical management of laparostomy and pyloro-duodenostomy of the first ( DI) and second ( DII) duodenal segments with one year of evolution , as a complication of several surgical interventions. The patient had been previously submitted to surgical interventions in another institution for: 1- lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage: treated with total colectomy; 2- upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage: performed a pyloroduodenotomy and pyloroplasty; 3- evisceration: abdominal wall closure; 4- biliary peritonitis<disease> due to pyloroplasty dehiscence: submitted to laparotomy with placement of a gastrostomy tube and pyloroduodenostomy tube; 5- intestinal haemorrhage through the pyloroduodenostomy tube: inconclusive exploratory laparotomy plus laparostomy; 6- gastrointestinal haemorrhage and shock<symptom>: submitted to jejunal segmental resection ( haemorrhagic mucous nodule<disease>); 7- several complications related to drainage , fistulae<disease> and celiostomy. After initial medical treatment for local and systemic stabilization during four months , the following surgical procedures were performed: antrectomy; duodenectomy of DI and the suprapapillary part of DII; T-L gastrojejunostomy; duodenojejunostomy ( DII and DIII) L-L at 40 cm of the gastrojejunal anastomosis; T-L jejunojejunostomy; abdominoplasty with a mesh and fibrin glue application; primary cutaneous closure. A multitubular drain was positioned near the duodeno-jejunal anastomosis and a suction drain was positioned in the subcutaneous space. The patient was discharged at the 60th postoperative day , asymptomatic and with a weight gain of 10 kg.
