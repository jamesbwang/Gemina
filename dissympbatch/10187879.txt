  Despite the progress in the management of cerebral arterial aneurysms<disease> , subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( SAH) remains the major cause of neurological disability. While SAH-related deaths usually occur as a result of brain<symptom> impairment<symptom> due to hemorrhage<symptom> , permanent neurological deficits are caused by cerebral ischemia due to edema<symptom> and spasm of cerebral arteries. Additionally , ~ 20 % -30 % of patients with SAH develop secondary cardiomyopathy; this phenomenon is known as neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy ( NSC) , which is associated with increased mortality and poor long-term prognosis. Levosimendan is a new inotropic drug that causes calcium sensitization of troponin C , thus increasing contraction force of myofilaments. The drug also causes opening of ATP-dependent potassium channels in vascular smooth muscles , which results in dilatation of veins and arteries , including cerebral arteries. To date , there have been several reports of levosimendan application in patients with SAH and neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy , and the effect of the drug on vasospasm has been previously advocated. This paper presents a case report of a 57-year-old patient with massive SAH , where levosimendan was used for reducing vasospasm.
