  The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with the surgical treatment of Thai patients with septic<disease> arthritis<disease> This retrospective cohort study used a university hospital database in Thailand to identify 450 adult patients with confirmed septic<disease> arthritis<disease> Data related to baseline characteristics , clinical and laboratory findings , treatment , and outcomes were collected. A multivariate analysis identified the factors related to surgical treatment. The patients had a mean age ( ± SD) of 53.6 ( ± 17.8) years , and 51 % were male. Surgical drainage was performed on 332 patients ( 74 %). The factors identifed as relating to the need for surgical drainage included preexisting joint disease ( odds ratio ( OR) , 2.6; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.3-4.9) , hip involvement ( OR , 36.3; 95 % CI , 4.1-320.5) , abscess<disease> formation ( OR , 5.6; 95 % CI , 1.1-27.1) , osteomyelitis<disease> ( OR , 4; 95 % CI , 1.1-14.9) , and positive synovial fluid culture ( OR , 3.8; 95 % CI , 2-7.2). In contrast , patients who were treated with steroids ( OR , 0.2; 95 % CI , 0.1-0.4) or had septic shock<symptom> ( OR , 0.31; 95 % CI , 0.13-0.83) were less likely to undergo surgery. This model correctly predicted 35 % of cases. Patients treated with surgical drainage had a significant longer length of stay ( median ( interquartile range) , 21 ( 11-34) days vs 14 ( 7-24) days; P < 0.0001) and were less likely to achieve complete recovery ( 26 % vs 53 % , P < 0.0001). However , the mortality rate was lower ( 2.4 % vs 10.2 %). Patients with septic<disease> arthritis<disease> who had underlying joint disease , hip involvement , abscess<disease> formation , osteomyelitis<disease> , and organisms in their synovial fluid were more likely to undergo surgical intervention with a significantly prolonged length of stay but had a lower mortality rate.
