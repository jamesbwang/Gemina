  Habitual toothbrushing with fluoridated toothpaste followed by rinsing with antibacterial mouthwashes is a method to maintain good oral hygiene and to diminish the occurrence and severity of dental<disease> caries<disease> and periodontal<disease> disease<disease> However , our understanding of how antimicrobial agents in mouthwashes affect fluoride-mediated caries<disease> lesion<symptom> remineralization is still poor. The objectives of this in vitro study were a) to determine the effects of the waiting period of chlorhexidine ( CHX) rinsing after fluoride toothpaste use and b) to further determine the effect of the type of toothpaste surfactant ( sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS) or cocamidopropyl betaine ( CAPB)) on caries<disease> lesion<symptom> remineralization associated with CHX rinsing. Caries<disease> lesions<symptom> were formed in bovine enamel specimens and assigned to 10 treatment groups ( n = 18) based on Vickers surface microhardness ( VHN). Lesions<symptom> were then pH-cycled for 10 days with daily regimen comprised of twice daily toothpaste slurry treatments ( 1150 ppm fluoride , with SDS or CAPB) , followed by CHX solution treatments ( 0 , 15 , 30 or 60 minutes following slurry treatment or no CHX treatment ( negative control)). VHN was measured again and the extent of lesion<symptom> remineralization calculated ( ∆ VHN). ∆ VHN with SDS-toothpaste was significantly lower than with CAPB-toothpaste , indicating more remineralization for the CAPB-toothpaste. ∆ VHN with 0-minute waiting time was significantly lower than with 30-minute waiting time and with negative control. The absence of CHX as an adjunct to fluoride toothpastes led to greater remineralization of enamel lesions<symptom> compared with the immediate use of CHX treatment for both SDS- and CAPB-toothpastes. CAPB-toothpastes indicated significantly greater remineralization than SDS-toothpastes , and can be suggested for patients at high risk of caries<disease>. A 30-minute waiting time for CHX treatment is recommended after brushing.
