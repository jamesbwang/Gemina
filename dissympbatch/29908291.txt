  Bronchial asthma ( BA) is a common chronic respiratory<disease> disease<disease> that has exhibited a rising global incidence in recent years. Glucocorticoids are used for the treatment of BA. Emerging evidence has demonstrated the roles of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF-α) , interleukin-8 ( IL-8) and eosinophil cationic protein ( ECP) in BA. The present study investigated whether TNF-α , IL-8 and ECP were associated with the clinical stages and severity of BA and the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of BA. A total of 199 patients with BA and 174 healthy individuals were included in this study. Patients with BA underwent glucocorticoid treatment , and the TNF-α , IL-8 and ECP levels and lung functions of the subjects were measured. The correlations of the TNF-α , IL-8 and ECP levels with BA severity , clinical staging and lung functions were assessed. We investigated whether the TNF-α , IL-8 and ECP levels aided in evaluating the efficacy of using glucocorticoids for the treatment of BA. TNF-α , IL-8 and ECP exhibited high levels in patients with BA , and glucocorticoid treatment notably decreased these levels. The TNF-α , IL-8 and ECP levels were positively correlated with the clinical stages and severity of BA and negatively correlated with lung function. TNF-α , IL-8 and ECP can be used as serum markers to predict the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of BA. The key findings of this study collectively support a role for TNF-α , IL-8 and ECP in BA development , and TNF-α , IL-8 and ECP can be used as serum markers of glucocorticoid efficacy in BA.
