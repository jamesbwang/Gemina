  Footwear contact dermatitis<disease> is a common problem with multifactorial exogenous , as well as endogenous , etiologies. Patch testing is the gold standard for detection of the possible contactants. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 108 outpatients over a period of 18 months. Demographic data comprising age , sex , and occupation were collected. Details of clinical and laboratory investigations were used to define the incriminating ingredient ( s) , subsequently confirmed by patch test using Indian standard and footwear series approved by the Contact and Occupational Dermatitis<disease> Forum of India. Reading and interpretation were carried out according to the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group ( ICDRG) guidelines. Of the 108 patients , 64 were girls or women and 44 boys or men. Although footwear contact dermatitis<disease> affected all age groups , most individuals were 21 to 40 years old. The morphology and distribution of the lesions<symptom> were very specific. Patch testing was helpful , the primary sensitizing agent being mercapto mix , followed by mercaptobenzothiazole , potassium dichromate , and paraphenylenediamine. Footwear contact dermatitis<disease> is an extraordinary entity , requiring a high level of expertise ( or knowledge) to determine its etiology through history , clinical examination , and patch testing.
