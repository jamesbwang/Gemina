  Prostate biopsy complications have important consequences that may affect patient compliance with re-biopsy schemes; however , this has not been studied in earnest. Thus , we evaluated whether previous prostate biopsy-related complications and the type of complication were associated with repeat prostate biopsy compliance in a clinical trial with study-mandated systematic biopsies. Retrospective analysis of 4,939 men ages 50-75 who underwent a 2-year prostate biopsy and were recommended to undergo the 4-year prostate re-biopsy in the Reduction by Dutasteride of prostate cancer Events ( REDUCE) study. The analyzed biopsy complications were: hematuria<symptom> , urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( UTI) , acute urinary<symptom> retention<symptom> ( AUR) and hematospermia. A total of 260 ( 5.3 %) men had a 2-year prostate biopsy-related complication , including 180 ( 3.6 %) hematuria<symptom> , 36 ( 0.7 %) UTI , 26 ( 0.5 %) AUR , and 102 ( 2.1 %) hematospermia. A total of 474 ( 9.6 %) men were noncompliant with the 4-year re-biopsy. In univariable analysis , any previous complication ( OR = 1.56 , 95 % CI = 1.08-2.24 , P = 0.018) , UTI ( OR = 2.72 , 95 % CI = 1.23-6.00 , P = 0.013) , AUR ( OR = 4.24 , 95 % CI = 1.83-9.81 , P = 0.016) and hematospermia ( OR = 1.78 , CI = 1.03-3.06 , P = 0.037) were associated with re-biopsy noncompliance. Hematuria<symptom> was not associated with re-biopsy noncompliance ( OR = 1.19 , CI = 0.74-1.91 , P = 0.483). Results were unchanged in multivariable analysis ( any complication: OR = 1.65 , 95 % CI = 1.08-2.26 , P = 0.018; UTI: OR = 2.62 , 95 % CI = 1.07-3.21 , P = 0.029; AUR: OR = 4.51 , 95 % CI = 1.93-10.54 , P = 0.001; hematospermia: OR = 1.85 , 95 % CI = 1.07-3.21 , P = 0.029; hematuria<symptom>: OR = 1.19 , 95 % CI = 0.74-1.93 , P = 0.472). In men undergoing repeat prostate biopsy , a previous biopsy-related complication and the type of complication were associated with lower compliance with re-biopsy schemes. Patients experiencing biopsy-related complications are ideal candidates to receive interventions regarding the importance of prostate re-biopsy to prevent noncompliance.
