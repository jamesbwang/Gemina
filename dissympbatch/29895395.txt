  It is unknown whether serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines would be high in children with early childhood caries<disease> ( ECC). This study investigated the association between serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines and severity of caries<disease> in preschoolers younger than 72 months. A case-control study was performed with a random sample of 72 children with ECC and 80 caries-free children. The explanatory variables were serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines ( IL-6 , TNF-α , and NGAL) and the outcome was severity of ECC ( number of decayed teeth). Thecrudeanalyses were used toestimate the association between each cytokine and ECC. Then , the analyses were adjusted for socioeconomic factors , excess weight and sugar sweetened beverages consumption using Poisson regression models. The estimated coefficients were expressed as Means Ratio ( MR) , with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI). In the crude analyses , the highest tertiles of IL-6 ( MR = 1.47 , IC = 1.09-2.00 , p = 0.012) , TNF-α ( MR = 1.33 , CI = 1.00-1.78 , p = 0.040) and NGAL ( MR = 2.20 , CI = 1.39-3.49 , p = 0.001) were associated to ECC. After adjustment , the highest tertiles of IL-6 levels ( MR = 1.54 , IC = 1.13-2.10 , p = 0.005) , and NGAL ( MR = 1.71 , CI = 1.04-2.80 , p = 0.032) remained associated to ECC; while TNF-α was no longer associated to ECC ( MR = 1.31 , CI = 0.98-1.75 , p = 0.066). Higher serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines were associated to severity of caries<disease> in preschoolers , suggesting that chronic inflammation<symptom> underlies ECC.
