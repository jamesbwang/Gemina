  A cholecystocolonic fistula<disease> ( CCF) is a late complication following repeated episodes of chronic inflammation<symptom> of the gallbladder in contact with the hepatic flexure , and it might cause a biliary ileus in the colon , causing an intestinal obstruction , and if left untreated , a life threatening disease. a 49-year-old female patient presented with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and bowel obstruction due to a gallstone impaction on the sigmoid colon as consequence of a cholecystocolonic fistula<disease>. An enterolithotomy was performed , and the patient evolved favorably. She was discharged without complications on the 5th Postoperative day ( POD). Clinical signs of CCF are usually minimal , and a preoperative diagnostic of CCF is rare , and it often presents with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , nausea<symptom> , vomiting , diarrhea<disease> , weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , and malabsorption. In the vast majority of patients presenting with CCF and biliary ileus , the stone is located within the sigmoid colon , accompanied with a concomitant disease at this point , with diverticulosis being the most common occurrence. A cholecystocolonic fistula<disease> with a gallstone colonic ileus must be suspected in an elderly , and female , patient presenting with cholelithiasis and with intestinal obstruction. Treatment should not be delayed , and correction of the intestinal obstruction ought to be the basis of the treatment.
