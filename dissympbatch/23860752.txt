  To study structural changes in naïve and surgically treated corneas<symptom> of aniridia patients with advanced aniridia-related keratopathy ( ARK). Two naïve corneal buttons from patients with advanced ARK submitted to penetrating keratoplasty for the first time , one corneal button from an ARK patient that had undergone a keratolimbal allograft ( KLAL) , two corneal buttons from ARK patients who had previously undergone centered or decentered transplantation and were now retransplanted and two adult healthy donor control corneas<symptom> were processed for immunohistochemistry. Antibodies against extracellular matrix components in the stroma and in the epithelial basement membrane ( collagen I and IV , collagen receptor α11 integrin and laminin α3 chain) , markers of fibrosis<disease> , wound<disease> healing and vascularization ( fibronectin , tenascin-C , vimentin , α-SMA and caveolin-1) , cell division ( Ki-67) and macrophages ( CD68) were used. Naïve ARK , KLAL ARK corneas<symptom> and transplanted corneal buttons presented similar histopathological changes with irregular epithelium and disruption or absence of epithelial basal membrane. There was a loss of the orderly pattern of collagen lamellae and absence of collagen I in all ARK corneas<symptom>. Vascularization was revealed by the presence of caveolin-1 and collagen IV in the pannus of all ARK aniridia corneas<symptom>. The changes observed in decentered and centered transplants were analogous. Given the similar pathological features of all cases , conditions inherent to the host seem to play an important role on the pathophysiology of the ARK in the long run.
