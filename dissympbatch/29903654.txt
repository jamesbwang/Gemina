  Allergic contact dermatitis<disease> ( ACD) is a highly prevalent inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> of the skin. As a result of the complex etiology in ACD , therapeutic compounds targeting refractory pruritus in ACD lack efficacy and lead to numerous side effects. In this study , we investigated the anti-pruritic effects of oxymatrine ( OMT) and explored its mechanism of action in a mouse model of ACD. 72 male SPF C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into control group , ACD model group , dexamethasone positive control group ( 0.08 mg kg OMT treatment significantly decreases the skin<symptom> inflammation<symptom> and scratching bouts. It rescues defects in epidermal keratinization and inflammatory cell infiltration in ACD mice. Administration of OMT significantly reduced levels of IFN-γ , IL-13 , IL-17A , TNF-α , IL-22 and mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-1β. Furthermore , it increased the percentage of Treg cells in peripheral blood of ACD mice. We have demonstrated that OMT exhibits anti-pruritic and anti-inflammatory effects in ACD mice by regulating inflammatory mediators. OMT might emerge as a potential drug for the treatment of pruritus and skin<symptom> inflammation<symptom> in the setting of ACD.
