  The long-term use of adefovir and tenofovir-antiviral medications commonly used to treat chronic hepatitis<disease> B-can be associated with proximal renal tubular dysfunction resulting in significant hypophosphatemic osteomalacia. However , there have been few reports about pathological fractures requiring surgical stabilization in cases of antiviral drug-induced hypophosphatemic osteomalacia. We present the case of a 51-year-old man who sustained bilateral pathological hip fractures associated with antiviral drug-induced hypophosphatemic osteomalacia. To treat a lamivudine-resistant hepatitis-B viral<disease> infection<disease> , the patient received adefovir for 7 years followed by tenofovir for the subsequent 3 years. He had suffered from polyarthralgia and generalized weakness<symptom> for 2 years prior to presentation at our clinic. Misdiagnosis and inadequate management of his condition accelerated weakness<symptom> of the bone matrix and ultimately induced pathological fractures. The patient was managed via cementless total hip arthroplasty on the left hip and internal fixation on the right hip. This case highlights that orthopaedic surgeons should consider the possibility of hypophosphatemic osteomalacia if patients receiving antiviral drugs complain of polyarthralgia and generalized
