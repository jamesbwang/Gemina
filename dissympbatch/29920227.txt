  Bladder outlet obstruction ( BOO) and the ensuing clinical lower urinary tract dysfunction are common in elderly patients. BOO is accompanied by urodynamic changes in bladder function and leads to organ fibrosis<disease> and ultimately loss of contractility. Comprehensive transcriptome analysis of bladder samples from human patients with different urodynamically defined phenotypes of BOO revealed tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α as the top upstream signaling pathway regulator. Herein , we validated next-generation sequencing and pathway analysis in cell-based models using bladder smooth muscle and urothelial cells exposed to TNF-α. miRNA profiling and transcriptome analysis of TNF-α-treated bladder smooth muscle cells revealed striking similarities with human BOO. Using a comparative approach , TNF-specific and TNF-independent pathways were delineated in human biopsy specimens. Concomitant down-regulation of smooth muscle cell-specific miRNAs and smooth muscle markers after TNF-α treatment was in accordance with the loss of contractility in humans in advanced obstruction-induced bladder remodeling. The expression levels of four abundant TNF-regulated miRNAs were modulated; the compensatory up-regulation of miR-199a-5p reduced NF-κB signaling. Essential hubs of TNF-α signaling pathways mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase ( apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1) and inhibitor of nuclear factor κ B kinase subunit β ( IκB kinase β) were targeted by miR-199a-5p. miR-199a-5p might be part of a negative feedback loop , reducing the impact of TNF , whereas its down-regulation in acontractile bladders from BOO patients advances the disease. The compensatory up-regulation of miR-199a-5p together with TNF-α inhibition may be therapeutically beneficial.
