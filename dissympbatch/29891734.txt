  To describe the anatomical and functional outcomes of the novel LVP keratoprosthesis ( Kpro) , developed as an alternative to the modified osteo-odonto keratoprosthesis ( MOOKP) , in eyes with end-stage corneal blindness<symptom> where conventional corneal surgeries are contraindicated. This prospective case series included 58 eyes of 56 patients ( 12 children and 44 adults) with severe bilateral keratopathy and completely dry , dermalised ocular surfaces who underwent unilateral LVP Kpro implantation from 2012 to 2016. In this two-stage procedure , an ocular surface labial mucous membrane grafting was performed , followed for 3 months by the implantation of the device under the engrafted mucosal flap. The primary outcome measures were anatomical retention rate and improvement in best corrected visual acuity ( BCVA). The secondary outcome measure was rate of occurrence of complications. Mean postoperative follow-up was 2.5 ± 1.1 years. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed an anatomical retention rate of 90.8 % ± 3.9 % at 1 year , 80 % ± 5.7 % at 2 years and 76.6 % ± 6.5 % at 3-5 years. The survival rates were comparable in children and adults ( 91 % vs 72 % at 5 years , p = 0.258). About 61.5 % of eyes maintained 20/400 or better vision and median BCVA improved from perception of light to 20/70 at 1 year postoperatively ( p < 0.0001). Complications like retroprosthetic membrane formation , glaucoma , vitritis , endophthalmitis<disease> and panophthalmitis occurred in 43 % , 26 % , 22 % , 12 % and 3 % of the eyes , respectively. The LVP Kpro is an effective procedure for the treatment of end-stage corneal blindness<symptom> in completely dry eyes. The LVP Kpro can be particularly useful in situations where the MOOKP is contraindicated or difficult to perform.
