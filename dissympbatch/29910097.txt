  We describe two Finnish siblings in whom an incidentally detected elevated creatine kinase activity eventually led to a diagnosis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy ( Type C12; MDDGC12). When diagnosed at age 10 and 13 years , they were mildly affected with a slow or non-progressive disease course. The main symptoms comprised infrequent hip cramps<disease> triggered by flexion , neck<symptom> cramps<disease> triggered by yawning , transient growing pains<symptom> , calf hypertrophy and mild proximal<symptom> muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom>. Their cognitive and motor developments were unremarkable and they were physically active. Whole-exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous mutations , both of which were novel , in the protein O-mannosyl kinase ( POMK) gene in both siblings; a missense mutation , p.Pro322Leu ( c. 965C > T) , and a nonsense mutation , p.Arg46Ter ( c. 136C > T). The results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing , showing that the parents were heterozygous carriers of one mutation each. This report adds to the literature by providing phenotype and genotype data on this ultra-rare POMK-related dystroglycanopathy.
