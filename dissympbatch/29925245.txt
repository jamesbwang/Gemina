  To develop an adequate model using reliable clinical and physical factors to predict pediatric obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome<disease> ( OSAS). Complete anthropometric measurements including BMI z score , tonsil size grading , and updated Friedman tongue position ( uFTP) were evaluated. Subjective assessments of clinical symptoms/signs , including snoring visual analog scale ( VAS) , nasal obstruction , and mouth<symptom> breathing , were recorded. Eighty-eight children ( 57 boys and 31 girls , mean age = 9.0 years) were confirmed to have OSAS by comprehensive polysomnography ( PSG). When the aforementioned variables were analyzed individually , the results indicated that snoring VAS , nasal obstruction , mouth<symptom> breathing , and BMI z score were reliable predictors of apnea/hypopnea index ( AHI/h) values ( correlation coefficient r = 0.386 , P < .001; r = 0.416 , P < .001; r = 0.255 , P = .02; and r = 0.243 , P = .02 , respectively). When all significant factors were included in the stepwise multiple linear regression analysis , the final predictive model is: Pediatric AHI = 0.108 + 0.103 snoring VAS + 0.894 nasal obstruction + 0.207 BMI z score ( F = 4.06 , P = .01). The proposed noninvasive , simple , inexpensive , and easy to perform screening tool could be used to predict pediatric OSAS. An abnormal calculated AHI may prompt clinical physicians to conduct further PSG diagnostics and treatment.
