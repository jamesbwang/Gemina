Risk of bias was carried out by two reviewers using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Paule-Mandel random-effects meta-analyses of Relative Risks ( RRs) and their 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were calculated.ResultsSixteen trials were included with 2,778 participants ( mean age 8.4 years). There was no significant difference in caries<disease> incidence or sealant retention rate for: mouth<symptom> side; maxilla vs mandible; or tooth type for: 1st permanent molar vs 2nd permanent molar; 1st permanent molar vs 2nd primary molar or 1st primary molar vs 2nd primary molar ( very low to low quality evidence). However , there was a difference between 1st permanent molars and premolars where sealed premolars were significantly less likely to develop caries<disease> or sealant loss ( low to moderate evidence quality). ConclusionsFissure sealants seem to perform similarly for sealant retention and caries<disease> rate for different sides of mouth<symptom> , arches and tooth types apart from between 1st permanent molars and premolars , where premolars have more favourable results. The quality of the evidence however , is very low to moderate and this should be borne in mind when interpreting the results.
