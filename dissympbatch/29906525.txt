  IL-13 has an important role in atopic dermatitis<disease> ( AD) pathogenesis. Tralokinumab is a fully human mAb that potently and specifically neutralizes IL-13. We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. In this phase 2b study ( NCT02347176) , 204 adults were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive 45 , 150 , or 300 mg of subcutaneous tralokinumab , or placebo , every 2 weeks for 12 weeks with concomitant topical glucocorticoids. Coprimary end points were change from baseline in Eczema<disease> Area Severity Index score and percentage of participants with an Investigator 's Global Assessment response ( 0/1 score and reduction of â‰¥ 2 grades from baseline) at week 12. At week 12 , 300 mg of tralokinumab significantly improved change from baseline in Eczema<disease> Area Severity Index score versus placebo ( adjusted mean difference , -4.94; 95 % CI , -8.76 to -1.13; P = .01) , and a greater percentage of participants achieved an Investigator 's Global Assessment response ( 26.7 % vs 11.8 %). Greater responses were found in participants with greater concentrations of biomarkers of increased IL-13 activity. Participants treated with 300 mg of tralokinumab demonstrated improvements in SCORAD , Dermatology Life Quality Index , and pruritus numeric rating scale ( 7-day mean) scores versus placebo. Upper<symptom> respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> was the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse event reported as related to study drug in the placebo ( 3.9 %) and pooled tralokinumab ( 3.9 %) groups. Tralokinumab treatment was associated with early and sustained improvements in AD symptoms and an acceptable safety and tolerability profile , thereby providing evidence for targeting IL-13 in patients with AD.
