  The crossed limbs stent graft technique is regularly employed to treat abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> patients with unfavorable aneurysm<disease> necks<symptom> or widely splayed common iliac arteries. This article numerically evaluates the hemodynamic performance of the crossed limbs strategy by analyzing numerical simulations and conducting experiments using two series of idealized bifurcated stent grafts with different cross angles and cross positions. Results demonstrated that the absolute helicity at outlets decreased with increased cross angles and increased with decreased cross positions. The time-averaged wall shear stress remained approximately unchanged , whereas the oscillating shear index and relative resident time decreased slightly when the cross angle increased and cross position decreased in iliac grafts. Additionally , both numerical and in vitro experimental results indicate the displacement force acting on the stent graft gradually increased as cross angles increased and cross positions decreased. Results further indicated that strip areas with a high oscillating shear index and high relative resident time , which may be vulnerable to thrombosis formation , exist along the outer surface of the iliac artery grafts. Given this information , the optimal crossed limbs configuration may contain a small cross angle and low cross position; however , low cross positions may increase the risk of migration.
