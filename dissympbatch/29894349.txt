  Systemic capillary leak syndrome<disease> ( SCLS) is an idiopathic vascular hyperpermeability that leads to profound<symptom> hypotension<symptom> , hypoalbuminemia , and hemoconcentration. Sixty years since its inauguration into literature , SCLS is still elusive , underdiagnosed , and profoundly dangerous. Few authors have documented anesthetic implications of classical acute SCLS , a form with complete recovery between exacerbations. However , minimal information is available about chronic SCLS , continuous generalized edema<symptom> with or without exacerbations. Both forms are postulated to have similar pathogenesis , yet clinical differences are noteworthy , warranting variations in perioperative management. We present a patient with chronic SCLS who underwent general and regional anesthesia for elective surgery.
