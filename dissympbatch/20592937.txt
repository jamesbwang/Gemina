  A bronchobiliary fistula<disease> , or a biliobronchial fistula<disease> ( BBF) , is a rare condition. It results from an abnormal connection between the biliary and bronchial trees , and is characterized by pathognomonic bilious sputum<symptom> with suspicious pneumonia<disease> Traditionally , an infectious<disease> disease<disease> , such as a hydatid infection , has been known to cause a BBF , but BBFs have recently become associated with tumors. In every case , procedures and treatments differ between centers , from simple conservative management to invasive surgical procedures. This case report presents two patients who had BBF after liver resection. Symptoms of each patients were treated and controlled successfully by percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage tube insertion. We hope that this report helps in the management of BBF in other cases.
