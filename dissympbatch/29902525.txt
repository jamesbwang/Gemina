  Propolis is known for its antioxidant , immune response modulating , and wound<disease> healing effects. In the present study in order to determine the bone healing capacity of the propolis extract , a critical sized , nonunion , radial bone defect model was repaired in rat , using chitosan and demineralized bone matrix ( DBM) scaffolds along with propolis extract. Seventy-two radial bone defects in 36 healthy male rats were randomly divided into 6 groups ( n = 12/group). The groups included autograft , defect or untreated group , chitosan , DBM , chitosan and propolis ( chitosan-propolis) , and DBM and propolis ( DBM-propolis). The bone repairing capability was characterized using radiography at 28th , 42nd and 56th postoperative days. Gross morphologic , histopathologic , histomorphometric and biomechanical examinations were performed following euthanasia at the 56th post-operative day. The DBM-propolis group , showed better structural and biomechanical properties compared to the untreated , DBM , chitosan and chitosan-propolis groups. The defect site in the chitosan and untreated groups were mainly restored by fibrous connective tissue while the lesions<symptom> in the autograft group were mostly filled by cartilage and a lesser amount of woven bone. The woven bone , and the hyaline cartilage were the main constituents of the newly formed tissues in the DBM-propolis group , at the 56th day after injury. The results of this study showed that percutaneous injection of diluted aqueous propolis extract in the bone defect ( 25 mg/defect) can improve bone formation in the critical radial bone defect in rat. Since there was no significant difference between the autograft and DBM-propolis group , probably this therapeutic strategy has high potential in augmentation of autologous bone grafting.
