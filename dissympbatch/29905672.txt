  Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated as a key cellular event leading to organ dysfunction in sepsis<disease>. Our objective is to measure changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics in subjects with early presentation of sepsis<disease> to provide insight into the incompletely understood pathophysiology of the dysregulated host response in sepsis<disease>. Prospective observational study SETTING:: Single site tertiary academic emergency department SUBJECTS:: We enrolled a total of 48 subjects were enrolled in the study , 10 with sepsis<disease> or septic shock<symptom> , 10 with infection without sepsis<disease> , 14 older and 14 younger healthy controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) were measured with high-resolution respirometry ( OROBOROS O2K). The median age in patients with sepsis<disease> , infection only , older control and younger controls were 63 , 34 , 61 , and 39 years old , respectively. In the Sepsis<disease> group , the median 1st 24-hour SOFA score was 8 , and the initial median lactate was 4.2 mmol/dL , compared to 1.1 in the Infection Group. The 30-day mortality of the sepsis/septic shock<symptom> group was 50 % , with a median length of stay of 7-days. The Sepsis Group had significantly lower routine and Max respiration<symptom> when compared to the other groups as well as uncoupled Complex I respiration<symptom>. There was also a significant decrease in ATP-linked respiration<symptom> along with the Spare Reserve Capacity in the Sepsis Group when compared to the other group. There were no age-related differences in respiration<symptom> between the Older and Younger control group. Bedside measurement of mitochondrial respiration<symptom> can be minimally invasive and performed in a timely manner. Mitochondrial dysfunction , detected by decreased oxygen consumption utilized for energy production and depleted cellular bioenergetics reserve.
