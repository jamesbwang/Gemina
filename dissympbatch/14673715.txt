  This randomized controlled trial ( RCT) aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of thoracolumbar burst fractures ( TLBFs) treated with open reduction and internal fixation via the posterior paraspinal muscle approach ( PPMA) and the post-middle approach ( PA). Patients with a traumatic single-level TLBFs ( T10-L2) , treated at our hospital between December 2009 and December 2014 , were randomly allocated to Group A ( PPMA) and Group B ( PA). Sex , age , time from injury to surgery , the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale score ( ASIAIS) , comorbidities , vertebral level , pre- and postoperative kyphotic angle ( KA) , visual analog scale ( VAS) pain score , and the Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI) scores were included in the analysis. Operative time , intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , x-ray exposure time , postoperative drainage volume , superficial<disease> infection<disease> , and occurrence of deep infection were documented. The patients were followed up at 2 weeks; 1 , 3 , and 6 months; 1 and 2 years; and every 6 months thereafter. Radiological assessments were performed to assess fracture union and detect potential loosening and breakage of the pedicle screws and rods at each follow-up. Postoperative VAS and ODI scores were used to evaluate the clinical outcomes. A total of 62 patients were enrolled ( 30 in Group A and 32 in Group B , respectively). The operative time ( P < .001) and x-ray exposure time ( P < .001) in Group A were significantly longer than those in Group B. However , compared to Group B , there were less intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( P < .001) , lower postoperative drainage volume ( P < .001) , lower VAS scores ( 2-week ( P = .029) , 1-month ( P = .023) , 3-month ( P = .047) , and 6-month follow-up ( P = .010)) , and lower ODI scores ( 2-week , P = .010; 1-month , P < .001; 3-month , P = .028; and 6-month follow-up , P = .033) in Group A. Although PPMA required a longer operative time and x-ray exposure time , PPMA provided several advantages over PA , including less intra-operative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> and lower postoperative drainage volume , and greater satisfaction with postoperative pain relief and functional improvement , than PA , especially at the 6-month follow-up after surgery. Further high-quality multicenter studies are warranted to validate our findings.
