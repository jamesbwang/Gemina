  Transfixation pin casts ( TPC) may be useful in management of fractures in ruminants. A retrospective study was conducted to report the uses , complications , and outcomes of TPC in ruminant fracture stabilization. Twenty-five cattle , 7 goats , and 7 sheep with long bone fractures managed with TPC met the inclusion criteria. Long-term outcome was assessed from telephone interviews with owners. Thirty-one animals ( 79 %) survived to removal of external coaptation and return to the farm. Common complications included pin-hole osteitis and disuse osteopenia. Common complications resulting in death or euthanasia included osteomyelitis<disease> and non-union and pin tract fracture. Animals with increased body<symptom> weight had a greater odds of dying or being euthanized. Cattle had a decreased odds of dying or being euthanized compared with goats and sheep. Long-term follow-up was available for 20 patients , 17 of which returned to intended use and 12 of which had no residual
