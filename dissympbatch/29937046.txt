  Renal cell carcinomas ( RCCs) are a heterogeneous group of tumors derived from the epithelial cells of the nephron. In recent years the genetic landscape of these tumors has been detailed , leading to progress in mouse modeling of the human<disease> disease<disease>. In parallel , substantial advancements have been made in describing the transcriptional programs of normal nephron cell types and how they respond to renal insults. Integrating these research fields may provide a deeper understanding of renal tumor initiation and progression , and provide leads that can be conveyed into mouse models that faithfully recapitulate the different RCC subtypes. We summarize here the genetic lesions<symptom> and molecular pathways that define RCC subtypes and discuss how these relate to cell-of-origin and renal repair programs.
