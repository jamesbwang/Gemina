  Joint hypermobility is a common , primarily benign finding in the general population. However , in a subset of individuals joint hypermobility causes a range of clinical problems mainly affecting the musculoskeletal system and , to a lesser extent , extra-articular disorders. Joint hypermobility often appears as a familial trait and is shared by several inherited connective tissue disorders , including the hypermobility subtype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome<disease> ( hEDS) and benign joint hypermobility syndrome<disease> ( BJHS/JHS). Although joint hypermobility has primarily been thought of as a rheumatological disorder , increasing evidence shows significant associations between both hEDS and BJHS with specific extra-articular disorders. To date , the strongest associations of these 2 conditions are with anxiety<symptom> disorders , orthostatic tachycardia<symptom> , various functional gastrointestinal ( GI) disorders and pelvic and bladder dysfunction. This review article focuses on GI disorders associated with both hEDS and BJHS. The aim of this review is to evaluate existing research and literature regarding associations between JHS ( hEDS/BJHS) and GI disorders. Our goal is to raise awareness of BJHS/JHS and hEDS as an explanation for chronic unexplained symptoms and functional GI disorders as well as to review the current standard tests available for proper evaluation of GI symptoms in these patients.
