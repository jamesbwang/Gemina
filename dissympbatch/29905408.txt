  Osteoarthritis ( OA) is one of degenerative and chronic<disease> diseases<disease> of articular joints. Articular cartilage is an avascular tissue , and its primary cellular component is chondrocytes. The main characteristic of OA is non-classic inflammation<symptom> and cartilage degeneration. Ginkgolide B ( GB) is a component of Ginkgo biloba which has diverse bioactivities. The present study uses an in vitro experimental model to detect the underlying anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects of GB and provides a new way for future clinical therapy of OA. Rat chondrocytes were isolated , cultured and treated with 1 Î¼g/mL lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) and/or different concentrations of GB. Cell Counting Kit-8 ( CCK-8) was used to test the cell viability of chondrocytes , and chondrocytes apoptosis was detected using a cell apoptosis kit. Collagen-II and aggrecan expression were detected by immunohistochemistry. Relative expression of genes was detected by real-time PCR and western blot. Ginkolide B did not inhibit chondrocyte proliferation , and ginkgolide B inhibited LPS induced matrixdegradation in chondrocytes. Ginkgolide B also reversed LPS-induced collagen-II and aggrecan decreased in chondrocytes via upregulated synthesis-related gene expression and downregulated matrix-degrading enzyme gene expression. Furthermore , we found that ginkgolide B significantly inhibited LPS-induced MAPK pathway activation. The results of our study suggest that ginkgolide B exerted anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects in LPS-induced chondrocytes , and might be an underlying therapy for OA afterwards.
