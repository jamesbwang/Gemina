  Laparoscopy is perceived as the state-of-the-art technique for a wide variety of operations but is contraindicated by comorbidities such as respiratory<disease> diseases<disease>. We present the case of a patient affected by asthma who underwent a successful three-trocar low-pressure pneumoperitoneum under spinal anesthesia. A 58 year-old male with symptomatic gallstones had partly-controlled asthma and respiratory allergies. Potential bronchospasm was avoided by a less invasive laparoscopic technique. Under spinal anesthesia open pneumoperitoneum was achieved at the umbilicus. Two more trocars were inserted. A cholecystectomy was performed in 90 minutes keeping the patient in a supine position and the pneumopneumoperitoneum at 8 mmHg. The post-operative course was uneventful. Discharge to home occurred on day two. Laparoscopy is contraindicated in the presence of hemodynamic<symptom> instability<symptom> and inability of the patient to tolerate laparoscopic surgery. Asthma is caused by bronchoconstriction from a myriad possible stimuli requiring a specific anesthetic plan. Spinal anesthesia under low<symptom> pressure<symptom> pneumoperitoneum is a safe alternative to general anesthesia in high risk candidates. In experienced hand , a three-trocar cholecystectomy is safe and feasible. Our patient represented a challenging case due to a partly-controlled asthma. Bronchospasm under general anesthesia was prevented by spinal anesthesia to keep a spontaneous physiologic respiration<symptom> , irrigation of the right subdiaphragmatic surface with lidocaine to control right shoulder pain , safe dissection by three trocars , a pneumoperitoneum at 8 mmHg , the supine position to prevent significant physiologic changes and minimize diaphragmatic irritation.
