  Regular airway clearance by chest physiotherapy and/or exercise is critical to lung health in cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF). Combination of cycling exercise and chest physiotherapy using the Flutter ® device on sputum<symptom> properties has not yet been investigated. This prospective , randomized crossover study compared a single bout of continuous cycling exercise at moderate intensity ( experiment A , control condition) vs a combination of interval cycling exercise plus Flutter ® ( experiment B). Sputum<symptom> properties ( viscoelasticity , yield stress , solids content , spinnability , and ease of sputum<symptom> expectoration) , pulmonary diffusing capacity for nitric oxide ( DLNO) and carbon monoxide ( DLCO) were assessed at rest , directly and 45 min post-exercise ( recovery) at 2 consecutive visits. Primary outcome was change in sputum<symptom> viscoelasticity ( G ' , storage modulus; G '' , loss modulus) over a broad frequency range ( 0.1-100 rad.s 15 adults with CF ( FEV The additional use of the Flutter ® to moderate intensity interval cycling exercise has no measurable effect on the viscoelastic properties of sputum<symptom> compared to moderate intensity continuous cycling alone. Elevations in diffusing capacity represent an acute exercise-induced effect not sustained post-exercise.
