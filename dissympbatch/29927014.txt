  First bite syndrome<disease> is a well-recognized complication of parapharyngeal space surgery. There are no reported cases of protracted first bite syndrome<disease> and subsequent diagnosis of a primary squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC) of the parotid<symptom>. We present the case of a 73-year-old man with no surgical history and 9 years of first bite syndrome<disease> who was ultimately diagnosed with a primary SCC of the parotid<symptom>. Diagnostic workup , including MRI and biopsy , along with oncologic treatment , were performed. Surgical treatment confirmed malignancy and also resulted in complete resolution of the first bite syndrome<disease>. First bite syndrome<disease> without prior surgery may warrant further diagnostic workup with imaging to evaluate for salivary gland pathology. When no radiographic mass lesion<symptom> is detected but the patient displays protracted symptoms unresponsive to conservative therapy , one should maintain an index of suspicion for malignancy , especially in the presence of symptom escalation.
