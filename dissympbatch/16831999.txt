  Limited intimal tears ( LITs) of the aorta ( Class 3 dissection variant) are the least common form of aortic pathology in patients presenting with acute aortic syndrome<disease> ( AAS). LITs are difficult to detect on imaging and may be underappreciated. This study sought to describe the frequency , pathology , treatment , and outcome of LITs compared with other AAS , and to demonstrate that LITs can be detected pre-operatively by contemporary imaging. The authors retrospectively reviewed 497 patients admitted for 513 AAS events at a single academic aortic center between 2003 and 2012. AAS were classified into classic dissection ( AD) , intramural hematoma , LIT , penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer<disease> , and rupturing thoracic aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease>. The prevalence , pertinent risk factors , and detailed imaging findings with surgical and pathological correlation of LITs are described. Management , early outcomes , and late mortality are reported. Among 497 patients with AAS , the authors identified 24 LITs ( 4.8 % of AAS) in 16 men and 8 women ( 17 type A , 7 type B). Patients with LITs were older than those with AD , and type A LITs had similarly dilated ascending aortas as type A AD. Three patients presented with rupture. Eleven patients underwent urgent surgical aortic replacement , and 2 patients underwent endovascular repair. Medial degeneration was present in all surgical specimens. In-hospital mortality was 4 % ( 1 of 24) , and in total , 5 patients with LIT died subsequently at 1.5 years ( interquartile range ( IQR): 0.3 to 2.5 years). Computed tomography imaging detected all but 1 LIT , best visualized on volume-rendered images. LITs are rare acute aortic lesions<symptom> within the dissection spectrum , with similar presentation , complications , and outcomes compared with AD and intramural hematoma. Awareness of this lesion<symptom> allows pre-operative diagnosis using high-quality computed tomography angiography.
