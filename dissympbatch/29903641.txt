  Chest tomosynthesis has been suggested as a suitable alternative to CT for follow-up of pulmonary nodules<symptom>. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possibility of detecting pulmonary nodule<disease> growth using chest tomosynthesis. Simulated nodules<symptom> with volumes of approximately 100 mm Area under the curve values ranging from 0.65 to 1 were found. The lowest area under the curve values were found when there was a mismatch in nodule position relative to the reconstructed image plane between the two examinations. Nodule<disease> size and dose level affected the results. The study indicates that chest tomosynthesis can be used to detect pulmonary nodule<disease> growth. Nodule<disease> size , dose level , and mismatch in position relative to the image reconstruction plane in the baseline and follow-up examination may affect the precision.
