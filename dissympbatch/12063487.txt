  Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis<disease> ( IGD) was first described in 1993 by Ackerman as a cutaneous reactive disease in patients with arthritis<disease>. Since then , numerous cases associated with different hematological and rheumatic disorders have been reported. IGD is a polymorphic entity that usually involves the upper part of the trunk. Histologically , it is defined as a diffuse dermal histiocytic infiltrate of different densities surrounded by fragmented collagen. We report the case of a 56-year-old man with pruritic papules affecting neck , proximal arms and thorax associated with weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and chronic<symptom> fatigue<symptom> for six months. Two punch biopsies were taken and the specimens showed lymphohistiocytic interstitial infiltrates with fragmented collagen and elastic fibers in dermis. IGD was diagnosed as first manifestation of a rare chronic myeloproliferative hematologic disorder ( cMPD) with rearrangement of beta-receptor for platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGFRB). After two months of imatinib , lesions<symptom> regressed completely.
