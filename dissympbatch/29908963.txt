  Werner syndrome<disease> ( WS) is a premature aging disorder caused by mutations in a RecQ-family DNA helicase , WRN. Mice lacking part of the helicase domain of the WRN orthologue exhibit many phenotypic features of WS , including metabolic abnormalities and a shorter lifespan. Yet , little is known about the impact of WRN mutations on the central nervous system in both humans and mouse models of WS. In the current study , we have performed a longitudinal behavioral assessment on mice bearing a Wrn helicase deletion. Behavioral tests demonstrated a loss of motor activity and coordination , reduction in perception , increase in repetitive behavior , and deficits in both spatial and social novelty memories in Wrn mutant mice compared to age-matched wild type mice. These neurological deficits were associated with biochemical and histological changes in the brain of aged Wrn mutant mice. Microglia , resident immune cells that regulate neuronal plasticity and function in the brain , were hyper-ramified in multiple regions involved with the behavioral deficits of Wrn mutant mice. Furthermore , western analyses indicated that Wrn mutant mice exhibited an increase of oxidative stress markers in the prefrontal cortex. Supporting these findings , electron microscopy studies revealed increased cellular aging and oxidative stress features , among microglia and neurons respectively , in the prefrontal cortex of aged Wrn mutant mice. In addition , multiplex immunoassay of serum identified significant changes in the expression levels of several pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Taken together , these findings indicate that microglial dysfunction and neuronal oxidative stress , associated with peripheral immune system alterations , might be important driving forces leading to abnormal neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom> in WS thus suggesting potential therapeutic targets for interventions.
