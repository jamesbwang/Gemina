  To clearly define transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathies ( TTR-FAPs) fulfilling definite clinical and electrophysiologic European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society criteria for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ( CIDP). From a cohort of 194 patients with FAP , 13 of 84 patients ( 15 %) of French ancestry had late-onset demyelinating TTR-FAP. We compared clinical presentation and electrophysiology to a cohort with CIDP and POEMS ( polyneuropathy , organomegaly , endocrinopathy , monoclonal protein , and skin<symptom> changes<symptom>) syndrome<disease>. We assessed nerve histology and the correlation between motor/sensory amplitudes/velocities. Predictors of demyelinating TTR-FAP were identified from clinical and electrophysiologic data. Pain , dysautonomia , small fiber sensory<symptom> loss<symptom> above the wrists , upper limb<symptom> weakness<symptom> , and absence of ataxia<symptom> were predictors of demyelinating TTR-FAP ( Misleading features of TTR-FAP fulfilling criteria for CIDP are not uncommon in sporadic late-onset TTR-FAP , which highlights the limits of European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society criteria. Specific clinical aspects and marked electrophysiologic axonal loss are red flag symptoms that should alert to this diagnosis and prompt
