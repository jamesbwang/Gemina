  Non-adherence to standard fasting guidelines may result in perioperative complications. We aimed to determine the association between pre-operative over-fasting and post-operative vomiting<symptom> amongst children undergoing bone<disease> marrow aspiration under general anaesthesia. A prospective cohort study was conducted from May 2015 to April 2016 in children undergoing bone<disease> marrow aspiration under general anaesthesia and their caregivers. Children fasted for â‰¥ 3 hours from last clear fluid intake constituted the exposed group ( The mean ( standard deviation) duration time of fasting of the exposed and non-exposed groups were 7.2 ( 2.4) and 2.2 ( 0.3) h , respectively. Thirty-two ( 15.8 %) children in the exposed group and 17 ( 8.4 %) children in the non-exposed group developed post-operative vomiting<symptom>. The relative risk of developing post-operative vomiting amongst over-fasting children was 1.9 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.1-3.3 , Over-fasting is a significant risk factor to develop post-operative vomiting<symptom> in paediatric anaesthetic practice.
