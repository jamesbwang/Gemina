  Introduction Rapid globalization has produced a growing demand for the chronic care management of overseas populations living in medically underserved areas. This study investigated the utilization pattern of telehealth counselling among overseas Koreans with high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and evaluated the relationships between mobile self-monitoring application and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> reduction. Methods A global chronic management programme consisting of lifestyle modification and self-monitoring blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> was launched to provide a telehealth counselling service for Koreans with high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> living in Vietnam from August 2016 to December 2017. During the first telehealth session , doctors educated patients on lifestyle modifications using a mobile self-monitoring application and checked the change of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in a follow-up telehealth visit. We examined utilization patterns and compared the blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> change among the mobile self-monitoring group versus the control group using Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Results A total of 234 patients with systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> of more than 130 mmHg or diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> of more than 80 mmHg were registered , installed the mobile app and were provided with automated blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> devices with the telehealth counselling service by Korean doctors. A follow-up telehealth counselling session was provided at three months. Only 15 % ( 36/234) received two or more telehealth counselling sessions. Significant differences were found in the mean change of systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> at three months in the monitoring group and the non-monitoring group ( -16.0 vs. -5.7 , p = 0.008). Discussion In this unique telehealth study , a mobile self-monitoring application was associated with significantly reducing systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> levels in three months. Encouraging patients via a mobile application that includes a self-monitoring function might have the potential for self-managing chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , especially in resource-limited environments.
