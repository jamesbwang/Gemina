  ( 1) To develop an evaluation grid to provide a systematic interpretation of calves ' articular radiographs , ( 2) to describe radiographic lesions<symptom> of septic<disease> arthritis<disease> in dairy calves less than 6 months of age , ( 3) to investigate potential associations between demographic data or synovial bacteriological culture results and radiographic lesions<symptom> ( 4) to determine whether an association is present between radiographic lesions<symptom> , their severity and the long-term outcome. Medical records of 54 calves less than 180 days old treated for septic<disease> arthritis<disease> between 2009 and 2014 with radiographic images performed in the first 2 days after admission were reviewed. Most common radiographic findings were increased articular joint space height ( An evaluation grid designed for veterinarians can facilitate systematic reading of articular radiographs and can be used for dairy calves with a presumptive diagnosis of septic<disease> arthritis<disease> This diagnostic tool may aid in establishing a prognosis and decision-making process in terms of treatment.
