  The prognostic value of the acute phase protein Pentraxin 3 ( PTX-3) is not well evaluated in patients with septic shock<symptom> , which reveal an unacceptably high short- and long-term mortality. New Sepsis-3 definitions are not yet implemented in most biomarker studies. Therefore , this study assesses the prognostic value of PTX-3 for short- and mid-term mortality in patients with sepsis<disease> or septic shock<symptom> , as defined by the latest definitions , treated at a medical intensive care unit ( ICU). The study includes 213 ICU patients with clinical criteria of sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom>. Plasma levels of PTX-3 , procalcitonin ( PCT) and interleukin-6 were measured on day 1 , 3 , and 8. All-cause mortality was followed up to 30 days and at 6 months. On all three days , PTX-3 levels were able to discriminate non-survivors from survivors at 30 days and 6 months ( AUC range: 0.59- 0.70; 95 % CI: 0.52- 0.79; p ≤ 0.02). Highest PTX-3 levels within the fourth quartiles during the first week of ICU treatment were associated with an increased mortality rate at 30 days ( OR = 7; 95 % CI: 2.0- 23.5; p ≤ 0.002) and at 6 months ( OR = 5; 95 % CI: 2.1- 11.4; p ≤ 0.006). Additionally , the prognostic value of PTX-3 was proven for all patients as well as in subcohorts of patients with sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom> , according to Sepsis-3 criteria , both in univariate and multivariate analyses for 30-day and 6-months all-cause mortality , especially predicting all-cause mortality in septic shock<symptom> ( HRs range: 1.0- 2.9; 95 % CI: 0.3- 5.1; p ≤ 0.03). PTX-3 offers prognostic value for the prediction of short- and mid-term all-cause mortality in patients suffering from sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom> according to the latest Sepsis-3 criteria.
