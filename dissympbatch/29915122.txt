  Identifying the causal pathogens of pneumonia<disease> complicating stroke is challenging , and antibiotics used are often broad spectrum , without recourse to the microbiological cause. We aimed to review existing literature to identify organisms responsible for pneumonia<disease> complicating stroke , before developing a consensus-based approach to antibiotic treatment. A systematic literature review of multiple electronic databases using predefined search criteria was undertaken , in accordance with Cochrane and PRISMA ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidance. Published studies of hospitalized adults with ischemic stroke , intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> , or both , which identified microbiological etiologies for pneumonia<disease> complicating stroke up to January 1 , 2017 , were considered. Analysis included summary statistics and random-effects meta-analysis where appropriate. Fifteen studies ( 40 % ischemic stroke , 60 % ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom>) involving 7968 patients were included. Reported occurrence of pneumonia<disease> varied considerably between studies ( 2 % -63 %) with a pooled frequency of 23 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 14 % -34 %; Although the analysis was limited by small and heterogeneous study populations , limiting determination of microbiological causality , this review suggests aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci are frequently associated with pneumonia<disease> complicating stroke. This supports the need for appropriately designed studies to determine microbial cause and a consensus-based approach in antibiotic usage and further targeted antibiotic treatment trials for enhanced antibiotic stewardship.
