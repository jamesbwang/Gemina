  The distal posterior inferior cerebellar artery ( PICA) is a rare site of aneurysm<disease> formation. Only small case series and case reports regarding surgical treatment are found in the literature.The PICA is divided into 5 segments ( anterior medullary , lateral medullary , tonsilomedullary , telovelotonsillary , and cortical) , and the distal ones represent the most complex , due to anatomic variations. We present a case of a 69-yr-old female patient who has suffered from a sudden and intense occipital headache<symptom> , associated with nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom>. CT scan showed intraventricular hemorrhage<symptom> , and further investigation with MRI and MR Angiography revealed a small distal PICA aneurysm<disease> , at the superior part of the medial aspect of the left cerebellar tonsil. Digital angiography has demonstrated the aneurysm<disease> at the tonsilomedullary segment of the PICA. In this 3-dimensional video , the authors show the microsurgical clipping of a saccular distal PICA aneurysm<disease> in the close relation to a choroidal branch , performed by median suboccipital craniotomy. Step-by-step of the dissection , relevant surrounding anatomy and aneurysm<disease> clipping is demonstrated. The patient signed the Institutional Consent Form , which allows the use of his/her images and videos for any type of medical publications in conferences and/or scientific articles.
