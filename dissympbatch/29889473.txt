  Atrial myxoma is a rare cause of stroke. In this report we present the case of a 52-year-old female patient who went to hospital suffering from a headache<symptom> Her neurological examination was normal except for a positive Babinski sign on the left. In the superolateral of the right , a Sylvian fissure consistent with a thrombosed aneurysm<disease> was detected using computerised tomography ( CT). Diffusion MRI showed an acute infarction on the right MCA area. Transthorasic Echocardiography and ECG were normal. A -16 × 4 mm-sized fusiform perpendicular aneurysm<disease> on the M2 segment Sylvian curve of right MCA and a -6 × 4 mm-sized dissecting aneurysm<disease> on P3 segment of the left posterior cerebral artery ( PCA) were observed in cerebral angiography. Transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE) demonsrated a large mass with a suspected size of 2 × 2 × 1.5 cm on the left atrium. The mass was resected and on the eighth day after the operation , she had a temporary vision loss<symptom> and hyperintensity on the T1 sequence was interpreted as laminary necrosis<symptom> suspected on Cranial MRI. In follow up , she was stable with 300 mg acetylsalicylic acid treatment. The main treatment is surgical resection in stroke caused by atrial myxoma.
