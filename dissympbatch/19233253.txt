  Simulated otitis<disease> media<disease> with effusion<symptom> reduces intracochlear pressures comparable to umbo velocity. Otitis<disease> media<disease> with effusion<symptom> is a common cause of temporary hearing loss , particularly in children , producing deficits of 30 to 40 dB. Previous studies measured the effects of simulated effusion<symptom> on ossicular mechanics; however , no studies have measured cochlear stimulation directly. Here , we compare pressures in the scala vestibuli and tympani to umbo velocity , before and after induction of simulated effusion<symptom> in cadaveric human specimens. Eight cadaveric , hemi-cephalic human heads were prepared with complete mastoidectomies. Intracochlear pressures were measured with fiber optic pressure probes , and umbo velocity measured via laser Doppler vibrometry ( LDV). Stimuli were pure tones<symptom> ( 0.1-14 kHz) presented in the ear canal via a custom speculum sealed with a glass cover slip. Effusion<symptom> was simulated by filling the mastoid cavity and middle ear space with water. Acoustic stimulation with middle ear effusion<symptom> resulted in decreased umbo velocity up to ∼ 26 dB , whereas differential pressure ( PDiff) at the base of the cochlea decreased by only ∼ 16 dB. Simulating effusion<symptom> leads to a frequency-dependent reduction in intracochlear sound pressure levels consistent with audiological presentation and prior reports. Results reveal that intracochlear pressure measurements ( PSV and PST) decrease less than expected , and less than the decrease in PDiff. The observed decrease in umbo velocity is greater than in the differential intracochlear pressures , suggesting that umbo velocity overestimates the induced conductive hearing loss. These results suggest that an alternate sound<symptom> conduction pathway transmits sound<symptom> to the inner ear during
