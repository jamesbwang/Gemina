  Introduction Patients exposed to whiplash trauma are at risk of developing pain and dysfunction of the neck and shoulder. Although rarely discussed in the literature , some patients also develop autonomic dysfunction. Case presentation A previously healthy 41-year-old woman was involved in a `` head-on '' car crash. During the following 3 years she developed severe and complex post-traumatic pain syndrome<disease> , which consisted of neck<symptom> pain<symptom> , lumbar pain , sensory-motor dysfunction , and myoclonic muscular contractions. Despite pharmacotherapy , physiotherapy , and rehabilitation , her condition worsened , resulting in severe disability. Fourteen years after the car crash , an interventional pain therapy program was started , which consisted of sympathetic ganglion impar block and medial branch blocks of facet joints at different levels. These treatment strategies ultimately normalized her sensory-motor dysfunction , reduced her autonomic dysfunction , and stopped the myoclonic muscular contractions. Conclusion This case highlights a possible interaction between the pain-generating facet joints , the somatosensory nervous system , and the autonomic/sympathetic nervous systems. The case also highlights the importance of identifying autonomic dysfunction in patients with persisting pain syndromes<disease>. Implications This complex case shows that many clinical phenomena can not be explained using our present knowledge of pain mechanisms. We hope that readers who have observed similar cases can learn from our case , and are encouraged to publish their observations.
