  This study was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of hepatocyte-derived microRNA ( miRNA) -122 in acute and chronic hepatitis<disease> of dogs. A total of 26 dogs presented at Veterinary Teaching Hospital , Faculty of Veterinary Medicine , Cairo University , 16 dogs out of 26 showing clinical signs of hepatic insufficiency were subjected to clinical , ultrasonographic , hematobiochemical and ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy for cytological and histopathological investigations. On the basis of these results , 7 dogs out of 16 dogs were found to be suffering from acute hepatitis<disease> and 9 dogs suffering from chronic hepatitis<disease>. 10 clinically healthy dogs were kept as control. Serum hepatocyte-derived miRNA-122 was analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in all dogs. The dogs suffering from acute hepatitis<disease> manifested jaundice , vomiting , and depression<symptom> while dogs with chronic hepatitis<disease> manifested anorexia<symptom> , abdominal distension , weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , and melena<symptom>. Hematological parameters showed normocytic normochromic anemia<symptom> and thrombocytopenia<symptom> in both acute and chronic hepatitis<disease> groups. Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) , and total bilirubin were significantly higher than control values in acute hepatitis<disease>. In chronic hepatitis<disease> , total protein and albumin were significantly lower than control values with normal ALT , AST , ALP , and gamma-glutamyltransferase values. Ultrasonography revealed a diffuse decrease in hepatic echogenicity in acute hepatitis<disease> while the increase in hepatic echogenicity and anechoic ascetic fluid in chronic hepatitis<disease>. Cytology revealed hepatic vacuolar degeneration and histopathology revealed necrosis<symptom> and apoptosis of hepatocyte in acute hepatitis<disease> while revealed massive fibrous tissue proliferation in hepatic parenchyma in chronic hepatitis<disease>. Serum miRNA-122 analysis , normalized for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression revealed a significant increase in acute hepatitis<disease> accompanied with elevation in ALT and AST , while in chronic hepatitis<disease> , elevation of serum miRNA-122 was accompanied with ALT and AST of the normal range. Serum hepatocyte-derived miRNA-122 is of diagnostic value and highly stable blood indicator for the detection of hepatocellular injury in dogs than aminotransferases , especially in cases where aminotransferases do not exceed normal serum level.
