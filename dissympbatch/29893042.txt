  Low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight has been associated with subsequent risks of obesity and certain chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , but evidence for this association is limited for Chinese population. We analyzed data from two population-based prospective cohort studies , the Shanghai Women 's Health Study and the Shanghai Men 's Health Study to examine the association. Information on self-reported birth weight was collected at the baseline in-person interview. Anthropometric measurements were taken at the study enrollment. Information on T2DM diagnoses was self-reported , and diagnoses of hypertension were based on self-reports and measured blood<symptom> pressures<symptom> at baseline and follow-up surveys. 11 515 men and 13 569 women provided information on their birth weight and were included in this study. Nonlinear associations were observed for birth weight with baseline body mass index ( BMI) , waist circumference ( WC) , waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR) and waist-to-height ratio ( WHtR) ( p values for nonlinearity < 0.05) , and low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight was linked with lower BMI , smaller WC , but larger WHR and WHtR. An excess risk of T2DM was observed for low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( < 2500 g) versus birth weight of 2500-3499 g since baseline ( HR: 1.17; 95 % CI: 0.92-1.49) and birth ( 1.29; 1.07-1.54) , whereas the HRs for hypertension were 1.13 ( 1.01-1.27) and 1.20 ( 1.11-1.30) , respectively. The risk of the diseases decreased as birth weight increased up to ~ 4000 grams; further increases in birth weight did not convey additional benefits. Our results suggest that low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight , an index of poor intrauterine nutrition , may influence health risks later in life in Chinese population.
