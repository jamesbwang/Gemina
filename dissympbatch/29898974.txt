  To update the 2004 American Academy of Neurology guideline for managing treatment-resistant ( TR) epilepsy with second- and third-generation antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs). 2004 criteria were used to systemically review literature ( January 2003 to November 2015) , classify pertinent studies according to the therapeutic rating scheme , and link recommendations to evidence strength. Forty-two articles were included. The following are established as effective to reduce seizure<symptom> frequency ( Level A): immediate-release pregabalin and perampanel for TR adult focal epilepsy ( TRAFE); vigabatrin for TRAFE ( not first-line treatment); rufinamide for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome<disease> ( LGS) ( add-on therapy). The following should be considered to decrease seizure<symptom> frequency ( Level B): lacosamide , eslicarbazepine , and extended-release topiramate for TRAFE ( ezogabine production discontinued); immediate- and extended-release lamotrigine for generalized epilepsy with TR generalized tonic-clonic ( GTC) seizures<symptom> in adults; levetiracetam ( add-on therapy) for TR childhood focal epilepsy ( TRCFE) ( 1 month-16 years) , TR GTC seizures<symptom> , and TR juvenile myoclonic epilepsy; clobazam for LGS ( add-on therapy); zonisamide for TRCFE ( 6-17 years); oxcarbazepine for TRCFE ( 1 month-4 years). The text presents Level C recommendations. AED selection depends on seizure/syndrome type , patient age , concomitant medications , and AED tolerability , safety , and efficacy. This evidence-based assessment informs AED prescription guidelines for TR epilepsy and indicates seizure<symptom> types and syndromes<disease> needing more evidence. A recent Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) strategy allows extrapolation of efficacy across populations; therefore , for focal epilepsy , eslicarbazepine and lacosamide ( oral only for pediatric use) as add-on or monotherapy in persons â‰¥ 4 years of age and perampanel as monotherapy received FDA approval.
