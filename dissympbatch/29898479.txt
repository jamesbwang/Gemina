  Irritable bowel syndrome<disease> ( IBS) in humans is described as the recurrent presence of gastrointestinal signs , without gross histopathologic evidence of inflammation<symptom> and of other morphologic lesions<symptom>; however , it is a syndrome<disease> not unanimously defined in veterinary medicine. There is some evidence that dysmotility could be related to stressors in some dogs that present with clinical signs ( e.g. chronic idiopathic large-bowel diarrhea<disease> that share overlapping aspects with human IBS. The authors hypothesize that an IBS-like condition , similar to that described in humans , might also be present in dogs. Nevertheless , the diagnostic path for canine IBS needs to be further elucidated and its pathogenesis better defined for a more rational therapeutic approach.
