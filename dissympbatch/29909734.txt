  To assess the prevalence of patients whose anatomy would be potentially amenable to percutaneous cholecystoenteric lumen-apposing metallic stents ( LAMS) insertion from a population of acute cholecystitis<disease> patients. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography images in 100 consecutive adult patients with acute cholecystitis<disease> were reviewed retrospectively. Feasibility of LAMS placement percutaneously or with endoscopic ultrasound guidance was defined as the presence of a straight and unobstructed trajectory from the skin<symptom> to the gallbladder , and between the gallbladder and the gastric antrum , or the proximal duodenum , measuring ≤ 2 cm , respectively. The gallbladder was within 2 cm of the gastric antrum or proximal duodenum without intervening structures in 95 of 100 patients ( 95 %). Percutaneous LAMS appeared anatomically feasible in 90 of 100 patients ( 90 %). Mean ± SD shortest inner-inner wall distance between the gallbladder and the adjacent proximal gastrointestinal tract was 1.20 ± 0.43 cm. The closest location for percutaneous LAMS was between the gallbladder and duodenum in 87 of the feasible cases ( 97 %). The percutaneous approach was transhepatic in 89.5 % , and extrahepatic in 10.5 %. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided LAMS appeared feasible in 95 of 100 patients , including 5 of the 10 percutaneously unfeasible cases. The other 5 patients appeared unfeasible due to colonic interposition or other intervening structures. LAMS appeared anatomically feasible percutaneously in 90 % of acute cholecystitis<disease> patients. The shortest and most direct path for percutaneous LAMS was transhepatic and cholecystoduodenal. Percutaneously placed LAMS may be an attractive alternative to percutaneous cholecystostomy.
