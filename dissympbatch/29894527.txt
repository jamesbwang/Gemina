  The isomorphic response is the appearance of new lesions<symptom> from a preexisting skin condition at a site of trauma. Discoid lupus erythematosus ( DLE) may develop on traumatized skin and also may arise at sites of a prior cutaneous eruption. We report the case of a 20-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) and DLE who developed a painful , multidermatomal , vesicular rash<symptom> on the left breast and back consistent with herpes<disease> zoster<disease> ( HZ) during treatment with systemic immunosuppression. Four months after the HZ resolved , the patient developed new-onset DLE lesions<symptom> within the prior HZ-affected dermatomes. Our case is one of few reports of an isomorphic response in an immunosuppressed young woman with a history of SLE and DLE. When HZ presents in this patient population , close monitoring of the HZ-affected sites for any evidence of DLE is recommended. Topical corticosteroids should be applied to the involved areas at the earliest appearance of such lesions<symptom> to further prevent potentially scarring DLE
