  This work was aimed to study skin blood perfusion , vasomotion and vascular responses of the Wistar-Kyoto rats ( WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR) in different stages of age using spectral. Laser-Doppler flowmetry ( LDF) was used to examine the ears<disease> and limbs of WKY ( 12 and 48 weeks old) and SHR ( 12 and 48 weeks old). The skin blood flow oscillations ( SBFOs) were studied by wavelet spectral analysis of LDF tracings. Then , we observed that old groups showed decreased perfusion and SBFO in the ears<disease> of both SHR and WKY. The SHR showed obviously lower postocclusive reactive hypera ( PORH) ratio at the same age. A decreased peak-time occurred in the SHR of old age group. After PORH test , a statistically significant increase was observed within all subintervals in the absolute amplitude of 12-week WKY and only within IV and III subintervals in the absolute amplitude of 12-week SHR. But , the absolute amplitude of 48-week WKY and SHR showed no statistically significant increase within all subintervals. Results indicated that local regulating function of peripheral vascular was impaired in rat with hypertension and aging.
