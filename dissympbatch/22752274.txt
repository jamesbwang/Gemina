  The aim of the study was to assess serum C-reactive protein ( CRP) level immediately after minimally invasive esophagectomy ( MIE) as a surrogate of surgical invasiveness in patients who underwent esophagectomy. In total , 104 patients were enrolled in the study: 37 patients underwent MIE in the left lateral decubitus position ( MIE-LP) and 67 patients underwent MIE in the prone position ( MIE-PP). Serum CRP levels were assessed on POD 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 after MIE , and were compared with surgical outcomes and duration of systemic inflammatory response syndrome<disease> ( SIRS) to investigate less invasiveness of the MIE. Reduced serum CRP level on POD 1 was associated with PP during MIE ( P < 0.001) and decreased blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( P = 0.03). MIE-PP was identified as a significant independent predictor of reduced CRP level on POD 1 ( odds ratio 3.65 , P = 0.042). CRP level on POD 7 was associated with gender ( P = 0.02) , position of MIE ( P = 0.011) , blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( P = 0.02) , and respiratory complications and/or anastomotic leakage ( P < 0.001). Postoperative respiratory and/or anastomotic complication was identified as a significant predictor of elevated serum CRP level on POD 7 ( odds ratio 3.44 , P = 0.048). Shorter duration of SIRS was shown in the patients with reduced serum CRP level on POD 1 and 7 ( P = 0.03 and P < 0.001 , respectively). Serial assessments of serum CRP level immediately after MIE may be a possible indicator that can reflect surgical invasiveness and postoperative complications.
