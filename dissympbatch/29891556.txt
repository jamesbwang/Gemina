  Genetic and immunological evidence clearly points to a role for T cells in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA). Selective targeting of such disease-associated T cell clones might be highly effective while having few side effects. However , such selective targeting may only be feasible if the same T cell clones dominate the immune response at different sites of inflammation<symptom>. We leveraged high-throughput technology to quantitatively assess whether different T cell clones dominate the inflammatory infiltrate at various sites of inflammation<symptom> in this prototypic autoimmune disease. In 13 RA patients , we performed quantitative next-generation sequencing-based human TCRβ repertoire analysis in simultaneously obtained samples from inflamed synovial tissue ( ST) from distinct locations within one joint , from multiple joints , and from synovial fluid ( SF) and peripheral blood ( PB). Identical TCRβ clones dominate inflammatory responses in ST samples taken from different locations within a single joint and when sampled in different joints. Although overall ST-SF overlap was comparable to higher ST-ST values , the overlap in dominant TCRβ clones in ST-SF comparisons was much lower than ST-ST and comparable to the low ST-PB overlap. In individual RA patients , a limited number of TCRβ clones dominate the immune response in the inflamed ST regardless of the location within a joint and which joint undergoes biopsy; in contrast , there is limited overlap of ST with SF or PB TCR repertoires. This limited breadth of the T cell response in ST of the individual RA patient indicates that development of immunotherapies that selectively modulate dominant T cell responses might be feasible.
