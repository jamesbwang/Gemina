  The article presents the results of our own studies to determine the criteria for the adverse variants of the course of infectious<disease> mononucleosis<disease> ( IM) in children. The study was conducted in the regional children 's infectious clinical hospital in Kharkov. 161 children aged three to fifteen years were under observation with diagnosis of infectious moninucleosis. Out of 161 ill children , 140 ( 86.9 %) had moderate severity of disease , and 21 ( 13.1 %) had severe forms. All children were prescribed standard clinical and laboratory-instrumental examinations. The diagnosis of IM was verified by PCR ( detection of VEB DNA in the blood) and ELISA ( anti-VEB Ig M and Ig G). In 140 children ( 86.9 %) IM proceeded sharply , smoothly ( the first group) , in 21 ( 13.1 %)- unfavorably ( wave and/ or prolonged course)- the second group. The groups were comparable according to age , the severity of the disease and other parameters. All children received therapy according to approved protocols ( Order of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine No. 354 of 09.07.2004). Immune status of children was assessed by determining the relative contents of CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + , CD16 + , CD19 + blood cells with appropriate monoclonal antibodies , serum IgA , IgM , IgG concentration by Mancini and interleukin ( IL) -1 β cytokine response and- 4 , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF α) is a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Based on the results of observations , it was established that the prognostically unfavorable criteria of IМ at the stages of manifestation of disease include: generalized lymphadenopathy<disease> involving 5-6 groups of lymph nodes and a significant increasing of them , purulent tonsillitis<disease> , marked increasing of size of liver and spleen on the background of anemia<symptom> , thrombocytopenia<symptom> , neutropenia and the absence of atypical mononuclears in the complete blood count. There is a depression<symptom> of the cellular link and an increase in the humoral mechanisms of immune responses in case of development of adverse course of IM.
