  To evaluate non-intravenously enhanced low-dose computed tomography with oral contrast ( LDCT) for the assessment of pregnant women with right<symptom> lower quadrant<symptom> pain<symptom> , when magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) is not immediately available. One hundred and thirty-eight consecutive pregnant women with acute<symptom> abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> were admitted in our emergency centre. Thirty-seven ( 27 %) of them , with clinical suspicion of acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> , underwent abdominal ultrasonography ( US). No further examination was recommended when US was positive for appendicitis<disease> , negative with low clinical suspicion or showed an alternative diagnosis which explained the clinical presentation. All other patients underwent LDCT ( < 2.5 mSv). Standard intravenously enhanced CT or MRI was performed when LDCT was indeterminate. Eight ( 22 %) of 37 US exams were reported normal , 25 ( 67 %) indeterminate , 1 ( 3 %) positive for appendicitis<disease> , 3 ( 8 %) positive for an alternative diagnosis. LDCT was obtained in 29 ( 78 %) patients. It was reported positive for appendicitis<disease> in 9 ( 31 %) , for alternative diagnosis in 2 ( 7 %) , normal in 13 ( 45 %) and indeterminate in 5 ( 17 %). Further imaging ( standard CT or MRI) showed appendicitis<disease> in 2 of these 5 patients , was truly negative in 1 , indeterminate in 1 and falsely positive in 1. An appendicitis<disease> was confirmed at surgery in 12 ( 32 %) of the 37 patients. The sensitivity and the specificity of the algorithm for appendicitis<disease> were 100 % ( 12/12) and 92 % ( 23/25) , respectively. The proposed algorithm is very sensitive and specific for detection of acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> in pregnant women; it reduces the need of standard CTs when MRI is not available as second-line imaging. • In pregnant women , US is limited by an important number of indeterminate results • Low-dose CT can be used after an inconclusive US for the diagnosis of appendicitis<disease> in pregnant women • An algorithm integrating US and low-dose CT is highly sensitive and specific for appendicitis<disease> in pregnant women.
