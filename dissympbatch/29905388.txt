  Granuloma<disease> faciale ( GF) is a rare chronic dermatosis with still unknown etiopathology , which usually presents a solitary , asymptomatic , smooth reddish-brown to violaceous plaques or nodules<symptom> on the face. Various therapeutic approaches , including topical application of corticosteroid or tacrolimus and removal with laser , cryotherapy and surgery have been attempted; however , the outcome has been inconsistent. Herein , we report a case of perinasal nodular GF who repeatedly underwent surgical excisions after the failure of laser treatment. Despite its nomenclature , GF does not manifest granulomatous tissue and the lesion<symptom> is histopathologically characterized by dense dermal cell infiltration devoid of granulomatous changes and not distinguished by a clear border , which partially explains the difficulty of complete removal in our case. Review of the published work delineated that GF could be largely divided into two clinical subsets: plaque and nodular types. The plaque type GF could be responsive to topical tacrolimus , an approach preferentially adopted nowadays , while nodular type GF was often resistant to topical therapies and required surgical or laser removal. The latter subset often arose around the nose. For this location , surgical excision with sufficient removal margin is sometimes technically difficult when an aesthetically acceptable outcome is expected , explaining the basis for local recurrence. Postoperative recurrence could be observed after years of disease-free period. These observations indicated that the need for respective treatment strategies for the management of distinctive GF subsets. Of note , a multidisciplinary approach combining radical resection and additional supportive intervention with long-term follow up may be required for perinasal and nodular GF.
