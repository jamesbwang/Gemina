  Balneotherapy is the treatment of disease by bathing in thermal spring water. This therapy has been used for centuries and remains a popular form of treatment for dermatologic and rheumatologic diseases today. Although the favorable climates of balneotherapy thermal centers have known beneficial effects on psoriasis and atopic dermatitis<disease> , the thermal spring waters themselves can also potentially decrease skin<symptom> inflammation<symptom>. The addition of phototherapy to balneotherapy , or balneophototherapy , further enhances the anti-inflammatory effects of thermal spring water. We have reviewed the literature on balneotherapy in the treatment of skin diseases , as well as describing their use in three different treatment sites , each with unique climates and chemical properties of the mineral water used in balneotherapy-the Dead Sea in Israel and Jordan , the La Roche-Posay Thermal Center in France , and the Blue Lagoon in Iceland.
