  Sleeve lobectomy ( SL) makes it possible to resect centrally located lung carcinoma oncological correct while protecting healthy lung tissue. However , this procedure is often limited with conventional video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery , due to the limited mobility of the rigid and long instruments and the limited visualization. Therefore , these interventions are often still performed in the open conventional technique with the well-known disadvantages. Particularly in the reconstruction of the respiratory<disease> tract<symptom> , precise sewing must be performed in a small space to avoid stenosis of the different diameter of the lumina. Robotic surgery offers several advantages through an enlarged three-dimensional view and flexibility of the robotic instruments , which are particularly evident when sewing. So far , there are only a few reports of robotic SL. Here , we describe our experience of performing robotic SL with four arms on both , the currently available DaVinci Xi
