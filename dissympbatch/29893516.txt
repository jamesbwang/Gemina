  Crohn 's disease ( CD) and ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) typically clinically manifest with symptoms like chronic diarrhea<disease> , cramps<disease> , abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , and rectal bleeding. However , symptoms of abnormal anorectal function seem to be of equal importance , regardless of the presence or absence of perianal disease. The aim of this study was to assess stool<symptom> patterns and the prevalence of symptoms of disordered anorectal function , particularly urgency and fecal incontinence , and their severity in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases ( IBDs). Thirty-three patients with CD and 38 patients with UC completed a questionnaire. A push/strain maneuver was performed on all patients and 20 controls. Thirty-three patients had more than 3 bowel movements a day; 44 had loose/watery stools<symptom>. Two patients had fewer than 3 bowel movements a week , 8 had hard/lumpy stools<symptom> , and 3 used laxatives. Excessive straining and incomplete evacuation were reported by 17 and 38 patients , respectively. Fifty-two patients complained of urgency and 32 of tenesmus<symptom>. Significantly , more UC patients than CD patients had urgency at least once a day ( p < 0.04). The following symptoms were reported by patients in the following numbers: fecal incontinence ( 31) , passive ( 20) and urge incontinence ( 16) , incontinence to gas ( 24) , as well as liquid ( 33) and solid stool<symptom> ( 7). Stool/gas discrimination was defective in 28 patients. Eleven patients had to wear pads. Everyday functioning was worsened because of urgency/tenesmus in 39 patients and because of fecal incontinence in 28 patients. The push/strain maneuver was abnormal in 12 patients with CD , 15 patients with UC and 1 control subject. The differences between the 2 study groups and the controls were significant ( p < 0.03 and p < 0.01). A majority of patients with IBD complain of urgency. Fecal incontinence is reported by over 50 % of patients. Both worsen patients ' everyday functioning. A relevant proportion of patients have symptoms consistent with constipation<symptom> , which is in connection with an abnormal push/strain maneuver in more than 1/3 of them.
