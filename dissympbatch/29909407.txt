  Cushing syndrome<disease> ( CS) is a rare disease in children , frequently associated with subtle or periodic symptoms that may delay its diagnosis. Weight gain and growth failure , the hallmarks of hypercortisolism in pediatrics , may be inconsistent , especially in ACTH-independent forms of CS. Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease ( PPNAD) is the rarest form of ACTH-independent CS , and can be associated with endocrine and nonendocrine tumors , forming the Carney complex ( CNC). Recently , phenotype/genotype correlations have been described with particular forms of CNC where PPNAD is isolated or associated only with skin<symptom> lesions<symptom>. We present four familial series of CS due to isolated PPNAD , and compare them to available data from the literature. We discuss the clinical and molecular findings , and underline challenges in diagnosing PPNAD in childhood.
