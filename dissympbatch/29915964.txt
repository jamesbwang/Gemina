  Pleural effusion<symptom> is a common finding both in patients with benign and malignant diseases of pleura and lung with diagnostic thoracentesis establishing the diagnosis in the majority of cases. The diagnostic thoracentesis can be done either blindly or under the guidance of ultrasound or computed tomography. However , minimal pleural effusion<symptom> is difficult to sample even under image guidance. Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS) is known to detect smaller volume of pleural effusion<symptom> and , thus , can help in guiding thoracentesis. To analyze the safety and efficacy of EUS-guided diagnostic thoracentesis in patients with undiagnosed minimal pleural effusion<symptom> retrospectively. Retrospective analysis of the data of patients with minimal pleural effusion<symptom> , who underwent EUS-guided transesophageal diagnostic thoracentesis over last 2 years , was performed. Thirteen patients ( 11 male; mean age 46.7 Â± 16.2 years) with undiagnosed minimal pleural effusion<symptom> underwent successful EUS-guided transesophageal diagnostic thoracentesis using a 22-G needle. Seven ( 53 %) patients had fever<disease> on presentation whereas two presented with cough<symptom> and loss of appetite<symptom>. Eight to 54 mL fluid was aspirated with an attempt to completely empty the pleural cavity. There were no complications of the procedure. EUS-guided diagnostic thoracentesis is a safe and effective alternative for evaluating patients with minimal pleural
