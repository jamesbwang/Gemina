  To increase the knowledge of central nervous system ( CNS) imaging features in deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 ( DADA2) by examining magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) studies of a relatively large number of patients. We retrospectively examined neuroimages of 12 patients ( 7 male , 5 female) diagnosed with DADA2. The mean age of the patients at the time of initial brain MRI was 16.7 Â± 10.2 years. Seven patients ( 58.3 %) fulfilled the classification criteria of polyarteritis nodosa. Brain MRI studies were assessed with respect to findings of ischemia , intracranial hemorrhages<symptom> , focal parenchymal signal abnormalities , cerebral/cerebellar volume loss , and abnormal contrast enhancement. Angiographic studies of 7 patients were evaluated for the signs of vasculitis. The most frequent finding was acute and/or chronic lacunar ischemic lesions<symptom> in the brainstem and/or deep gray matter ( n = 9 , 75 %). Six patients ( 50 %) revealed MRI findings compatible with recurrent ischemic attacks. Small nodular contrast enhancement ( n = 2 , 16.6 %) , acute putaminal hemorrhage<symptom> ( n = 1 , 8.3 %) and findings compatible with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome<disease> ( n = 1 , 8.3 %) were also detected. Slight-to-moderate diffuse cerebral and/or cerebellar volume loss ( n = 7 , 58.3 %) , decreased T1 signal of the bone<disease> marrow ( n = 6 , 50 %) and optic atrophy ( n = 1 , 8.3 %) were the other findings on brain MRI. The only abnormal angiographic finding was reduced caliber of the right distal posterior cerebral artery in MRA of a patient ( 14.6 %). DADA2 should be included in the differential diagnosis of young patients presenting with ischemic and/or hemorrhagic lesions<symptom> located in the brainstem and deep gray matter , especially if they have a family history or additional systemic abnormalities.
