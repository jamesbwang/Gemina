  Acute pancreatitis<disease> ( AP) in most patients takes a course of self-limiting local inflammation<symptom>. However , up to 20 % of patients develop severe AP ( SAP) , associated with systemic inflammation<symptom> and/or pancreatic necrosis<symptom>. Early prediction of SAP allows for the appropriate intensive treatment of severe cases , which reduces mortality. Serum interleukin-6 ( IL-6) has been proposed as a biomarker to assist early diagnosis of SAP , however , most data come from studies utilizing IL-6 measurements with ELISA. Our aim was to verify the diagnostic usefulness of IL-6 for the prediction of SAP , organ<symptom> failure<symptom> , and need for intensive care in the course of AP using a fully automated assay. The study included 95 adult patients with AP of various severity ( 29 mild , 58 moderately-severe , 8 severe) admitted to a hospital within 24 h from the onset of symptoms. Serum IL-6 was measured using electochemiluminescence immunoassay in samples collected on admission and on the next day of hospital stay. On both days , patients with SAP presented the highest IL-6 levels. IL-6 correlated positively with other inflammatory markers ( white blood cell and neutrophil counts , C-reactive protein , procalcitonin) , the markers of renal injury ( kidney injury molecule-1 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) , and the markers of endothelial dysfunction ( angiopoietin-2 , soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1). IL-6 on admission significantly predicted SAP , vital organ<symptom> failure<symptom> , and the need for intensive care or death , with areas under the receiver operating curve between 0.75 and 0.78 , not significantly different from multi-variable prognostic scores. The fully automated assay allows for fast and repeatable measurements of serum IL-6 , enabling wider clinical use of this valuable biomarker.
