  Integration of hypofractionated body radiotherapy ( H-RT) into immune checkpoint inhibitor ( ICI) therapy may be a promising strategy to improve the outcomes of ICIs , although sufficient data is lacking regarding the safety and efficacy of this regimen. We , hereby , reviewed the safety and efficacy of this combination in 59 patients treated with H-RT during or within 8 weeks of ICI infusion and compared results with historical reports of ICI treatment alone. Most patients had RCC or melanoma. Median follow-up was 11 months. Most patients received either Nivolumab alone or with Ipilimumab; 83 % received stereotactic RT and 17 % received conformal H-RT. Any grade adverse events ( AEs) were reported in 46 patients , and grade 3-4 in 12 patients without any treatment-related grade 5 toxicity. The most common grade 3 AEs were fatigue<symptom> and pneumonitis<disease>. Grade 3-4 toxicities were higher with ICI combination and with simultaneous ICIs. Overall , most any-grade or grade ≥ 3 AE rates did not differ significantly from historically reported rates with single-agent or multi-agent ICIs. Toxicity did not correlate with H-RT site , dose , fraction number , tumor type , or ICI and H-RT sequencing. Median progression-free survival was 6.5 months. Objective response rate ( ORR) was 26 %; 10 % had complete response ( CR). Median duration of response was 9.4 ± 4.6 months. H-RT of lung lesions<symptom> was more likely to achieve CR than other sites. H-RT of bone lesions<symptom> had a lower ORR than non-bone H-RT. In conclusion , combining body H-RT with ICIs is safe and promising. Prospective validation is warranted.
