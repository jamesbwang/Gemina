  Improving the quality of life is part of the global agenda. The focus is predominantly on prevention of socially significant diseases. Combating dental caries-related diseases is a top priority as it has a huge impact on people 's social lives. Therefore , the purpose of the work was to study the changes in the molecular composition of saliva from subjects with multiple caries<disease> lesions<symptom> using spectroscopic methods of analysis to identify potential tissue markers of caries<disease> development for predictive , preventive and personalised medical services. The molecular composition of mixed saliva ( oral fluid) from subjects with and without multiple caries<disease> was analysed with the use of spectroscopic techniques , FTIR with synchrotron radiation for the excitation. The IR spectra of the oral fluid as well as the calculated mineral-organic , carbon-phosphate , Amide II/Amide I and protein/thiocyanate ratios were compared between subjects with and without multiple caries<disease>. This complex analysis of the obtained experimental data determined that the molecular composition of the oral fluid from those with multiple caries<disease> differed from those without caries<disease>; the organic-mineral balance<symptom> in the oral fluid of those with multiple caries<disease> shifted towards a reduction in the mineral complexes , accompanied by an increase in the organic component. The thiocyanate content increased more than twofold , accompanied by increased carboxyl groups of esters , lipids and carbohydrates. The detected features in the IR spectra of mixed saliva as well as the calculated changes in the ratios between organic and inorganic components can be used as biomarkers of cariogenesis in the oral cavity , as a diagnostic criterion in the analysis of the oral fluid samples.
