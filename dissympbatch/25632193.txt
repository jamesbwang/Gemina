  The epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) varies in different countries. This study aimed to assess phenotype , medications , prevalence and incidence of IBD in the State of Espírito Santo , Brazil. Patients with IBD who utilized the Public Medication-Dispensing System of the Department of Health of Espírito Santo , between August 2012 and July 2014. Of 1484 active patients , 1048 were analyzed , which included patients of all ages. The prevalence of IBD was 38.2 per 100,000 inhabitants , with ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) being 24.1 per 100,000 and Crohn 's disease ( CD) , 14.1 per 100,000. The incidence of IBD was 7.7 per 100,000 inhabitants/year ( UC- 5.3/ 100,000 inhabitants/year and CD- 2.4/ 100,000 inhabitants/year). Out of the 1048 patients analyzed , 669 had UC ( 63.84 %) , 357 had CD ( 34.06 %) , and 22 had unclassified inflammatory bowel disease ( UIBD; 2.10 %). There were 48/1048 ( 4.5 %) pediatric patients ( 16 years of age or younger). On the UC phenotype ( n = 654) , we observed left-sided colitis<disease> in 247 ( 37.7 %) , pancolitis in 209 ( 31.9 %) , and proctitis<disease> in 198 patients ( 30.2 %). Pancolitis was more frequent in pediatric patients ( p = 0.007). CD showed a homogeneous distribution between ileitis<symptom> ( L1) , colitis<disease> ( L2) , and ileocolitis ( L3). Regarding the CD behavior ( n = 352) observed the inflammatory type ( B1) in 176 ( 50 %); fistulizing ( B3) in 75 ( 21.2 %) , isolated type ( B3) in 29 ( 8.2 %) , and perianal fistulizing type ( B3p) in 46 ( 13.1 %). Biologic therapies were used in 154/357 ( 43.3 %). The prevalence of the IBD in the state of Espírito Santo , Brazil was higher than in two other brazilian studies. There was high utilization of biologic therapies in patients with CD.
