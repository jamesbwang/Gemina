  Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom> ( HF) and end stage renal disease ( ESRD) are associated with increased morbidity , mortality , and are responsible for an immense economic burden. We sought to evaluate the impact of ESRD in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> by using a national cohort. This is a retrospective cohort study using the National Inpatient Sample ( NIS) of patients hospitalized with HF from 2010 to 2014. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Multivariate regression was used for the statistical analysis. We identified a total 1,587,172 patients with systolic HF and 1,316,220 with diastolic HF. Patients with systolic HF and ESRD had higher in-hospital mortality ( 4.6 % vs 2.7 % OR: 1.86 , p < 0.001). The in-hospital mortality in diastolic HF and ESRD was 2.7 % vs 2.5 % in those without ESRD ( OR: 1.11 , p = 0.03). Patients with systolic HF and ESRD had significantly higher rates of ICU admissions ( OR: 1.56 , p < 0.001) , mean length of stay ( +1.5 days , p < 0.001) , median hospital costs ( p < 0.001) , and acute<disease> respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> ( OR: 1.58 , p < 0.001). Similarly , patients with diastolic HF and ESRD also had significantly higher rates of ICU admissions ( OR: 1.59 , p < 0.001) , acute<disease> respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> ( OR: 1.54 , p < 0.001) , mean length of stay ( +1.1 days , p < 0.001) , and median hospital costs ( p < 0.001). ESRD is associated with significantly increased in-hospital mortality in HF but the increase is nearly two-fold ( 86 %) for systolic HF and very modest ( 11 %) in diastolic HF. However , hospital costs , ICU admissions , acute<disease> respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> , and length of stay are similarly higher for patients with both systolic and diastolic HF and ESRD.
