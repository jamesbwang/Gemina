  To investigate pathogenesis , diagnosis , and treatment of crush syndrome<disease> of chest and arm. Between January 2010 and January 2015 , 5 cases of crush syndrome<disease> of chest and arm caused by pressing oneself in a coma<symptom> after CO poisoning<disease> or alcoholic intoxication were treated. There were 4 males and 1 female with an average age of 36.7 years ( range , 28-46 years). Two patients involved left upper limb and chest , while the other three patients involved right upper limb and chest. The crushed time ranged from 4 to 12 hours ( mean , 7 hours). All 5 cases received emergency decompression and vacuum sealing drainage ( VSD). After surgery , the patients were transferred to Intensive Care Unit to receive continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT). The wounds<disease> were repaired with skin grafts after the patients ' condition were stable. The hospitalization time was 26-48 days ( mean , 33 days). Necrosis<symptom> of the skin graft occurred in 1 case , which cured after debridement and skin graft again. The skin graft survived in the other cases and the wounds<disease> healed by first intension. Five patients were followed up 12-18 months ( mean , 15 months). At last follow-up , the results were excellent in all 5 cases according to the assessment criteria proposed by GU Yudong. The patients got full recovery of their upper limb activities and sensation. All the patients returned to the normal life and work. CO poisoning<disease> , drunkenness , and pressing oneself together will lead the crush syndrome<disease> to severe and rapid progress. The key of the treatment is a comprehensive therapy including a thorough and rapid tension reduction to save the limb function , CRRT , and correction of anemia<symptom> and electrolyte imbalance.
