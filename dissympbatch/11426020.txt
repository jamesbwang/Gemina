  Absolute cardiovascular risk of an individual with rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) is greater when compared to the general population , and several factors have proven to be important for the development of coronary artery disease ( CAD) in these patients , including factors related to the underlying disease , such as the systemic inflammatory response , drugs used in its treatment , and a higher prevalence of traditional risk factors for CAD. Our aim is to describe the recognition and control frequencies of systemic arterial hypertension ( SAH) , dyslipidemia , and diabetes mellitus ( DM) in RA patients. Patients with RA answered a questionnaire focused on their general knowledge of the risk factors for CAD , as well as on the recognition of the risk factors that they possess. The patient 's information , collected from a structured medical record , was reviewed to evaluate the control of risk factors. Hundred and thirty-four patients were included in the study. One patient was excluded due to the impossibility of reviewing her medical records. Therefore , 133 patients remained in the study. Patients had a mean ( SD) age of 57.3 ( 12.9) years. SAH was diagnosed in 88 subjects , with a recognition frequency of 89.8 % , and 63.3 % had desirable blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control. Seventy-two patients were diagnosed with dyslipidemia; 68.1 % recognized that they had dyslipidemia and 69.4 % achieved desirable LDL-c control. Twenty-two patients had DM; 90.9 % admitted being diabetic and 40.9 % had desirable glycemic control. The frequencies of the CAD risk factor recognition and control were high in comparison to those described for the general population.
