  Sacral neoplasms often present as large masses that often require sacrectomy. Multiple sacral nerve roots may be compromised post-sacrectomy and postoperative complications may result in impaired mobility , pain , orthostasis , and neurogenic bowel and bladder. CASE # 1: 58 year-old female with a sacral solitary fibrous tumor underwent a high-level sacrectomy and bilateral gluteal muscle flaps. Her rehabilitation course included management of pain , orthostasis , and neurogenic bowel and bladder. CASE # 2: 67 year-old male with sacral chordoma underwent high-level sacrectomy and bilateral gluteal muscle flaps. His rehabilitation course was complicated by refractory orthostatic hypotension<symptom> , pain , and wound<disease> impairment , which resulted in slow rehabilitation progression and bowel and bladder training. Progression of activity in both cases was limited by surgical restrictions to support wound<disease> healing. Multidisciplinary efforts after a sacrectomy are vital to successful rehabilitation. Highly functional outcomes are seen , including independent bowel and bladder management and return to preoperative ambulatory status.
