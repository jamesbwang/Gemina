  To investigate the protective effect of exendin-4 against diabetic cardiomyopathy in mice and explore the underlying mechanism. C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into normal control group with normal diet and diabetic group with high-fat diet for 4 weeks before streptozotocin injection. The successfully established diabetic mouse models were divided into diabetic group with exendin-4 treatment and diabetic control group for daily treatment with intraperitoneal injection of 1 nmol/kg exendin-4 and saline of equivalent volume for 8 weeks , respectively. The physiological parameters such as blood glucose and body<symptom> weight were recorded. RT-PCR was used to examine the transcription levels of genes related with myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis<disease> and the genes related with mitochondrial functions including PGC1α , NRF and CytoC. The expressions of oxidative stress markers and Sirt1/PGC1 proteins were measured using Western blotting. and HE staining was used to observe the myocardial structural changes in the mice. Compared with the normal control mice , the mice in diabetic control group showed significantly increased blood glucose and blood lipid levels ( P < 0.001) , which were obviously improved by Exendin-4 treatment. The expressions of ANP , BNP , TGFβ1 , CytoC1 and NOX1 were significantly increased ( P < 0.05) while Sirt1 , PGC1α , NRF and SOD1 expression were markedly decreased in the myocardial tissue of the diabetic mice ( P < 0.05). Exendin-4 treatment resulted in obviously reduced expressions of ANP , BNP , TGFβ1 , CytoC1 and NOX1 ( P < 0.05) and increased expressions of Sirt1 , PGC1α , NRF and SOD1 ( P < 0.05) in the diabetic mice. Exendin-4 protects against myocardial injury in diabetic mice by improving mitochondrial function and inhibiting oxidative stress through the Sirt1/PGC1α signaling pathway.
