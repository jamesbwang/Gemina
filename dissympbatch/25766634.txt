  We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic value of quantification of myocardial flow reserve ( MFR) with positron emission tomography ( PET) in orthotopic heart transplant patients. We retrospectively identified orthotopic heart transplant patients who underwent rubidium-82 cardiac PET imaging. The primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death , acute coronary syndrome<disease> , coronary revascularization , and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> hospitalization. Cox regression was used to evaluate the association of MFR with the primary outcome. The relationship of MFR and cardiac allograft vasculopathy severity in patients with angiography within 1 year of PET imaging was assessed using Spearman rank correlation and logistic regression. A total of 117 patients ( median age , 60 years; 71 % men) were identified. Twenty-one of 62 patients ( 34 %) who underwent angiography before PET had cardiac allograft vasculopathy. The median time from orthotopic heart transplant to PET imaging was 6.4 years ( median global MFR , 2.31). After a median of 1.4 years , 22 patients ( 19 %) experienced the primary outcome. On an unadjusted basis , global MFR ( hazard ratio , 0.22 per unit increase; 95 % confidence interval , 0.09-0.50; MFR assessed by cardiac rubidium-82 PET imaging is a predictor of cardiovascular events after orthotopic heart transplant and is associated with cardiac allograft vasculopathy severity.
