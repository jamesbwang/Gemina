  Medulloblastoma is the most common posterior fossa tumor of childhood typically within the fourth ventricle. However , extra-axial medulloblastoma in posterior fossa is an uncommon diagnosis. We report a case in a 33-month-old male who presented with repeated complaints of abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , intermittent emesis , and diarrhea<disease> , and diagnosed with right cerebellar extra-axial medulloblastoma , which was surgically resected. Majority of the reported extra-axial medulloblastoma in posterior fossa in the United States are located in the cerebellopontine angle. However , to the best of our knowledge , our case is the first to document medulloblastoma occurring exclusively in the cerebellar hemispheric extra-axial space rather than the cerebellopontine angle. Although the diagnosis can present as a radiological dilemma , a systematic multimodality imaging approach can aid in narrowing the differential diagnosis and timely management. In this case report , we will discuss the imaging characteristics , differential diagnosis , and management strategies , alongside a brief review of the world literature of extra-axial medulloblastoma.
