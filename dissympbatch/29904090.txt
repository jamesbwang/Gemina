  Tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) is a preventable and curable infection , but remains a significant cause of death. The dental team is likely to encounter patients with a history of TB , however , at present there is limited guidance available to inform the provision of oral healthcare for this patient group. This may lead to confusion<symptom> with delays in care. There is a potential health risk posed to patients and co-workers by a member of the dental team who becomes infected. TB has the potential to be a major issue for oral healthcare in the United Kingdom ( UK). This paper discusses the implications for both patient care and management of the dental team.
