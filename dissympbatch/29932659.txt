  Liposome carriers for delivering small interfering RNA ( siRNA) into target cells are of tremendous importance because the siRNA-based therapy offers a completely new approach for treating a wide range of diseases , including cancer and viral<disease> infections<disease>. In this paper , we employ the state-of-the-art computer simulations to get an atomic-scale insight into the interactions of siRNA with zwitterionic ( neutral) lipids. Our computational findings clearly demonstrate that siRNA does adsorb on the surface of a neutral lipid bilayer. The siRNA adsorption , being rather weak and unstable , is driven by attractive interactions of overhanging unpaired nucleotides with choline moieties of lipid molecules. It is the presence of the unpaired terminal nucleotides that underlies a drastic difference between siRNA and DNA; the latter is not able to bind to the zwitterionic lipid bilayer. We also show that adding divalent Ca ions leads to the formation of stable siRNA-lipid system complexes; these complexes are stabilized by Ca-mediated aggregates of siRNA and lipid molecules rather than by the overhanging siRNA nucleotides. Furthermore , the molecular mechanism of interactions between siRNA and the lipid bilayer in the presence of divalent cations seems to involve exchange of Ca ions between the outer mouth<symptom> of the major groove of siRNA and the lipid/water interface. Overall , our findings contribute significantly to a deeper understanding of the structure and function of liposome carriers used for siRNA delivery and can be used as a theoretical basis for further development of siRNA-based therapeutics.
