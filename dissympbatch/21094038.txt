  The present study reports on the efficacy and safety of adjuvant docetaxel in real-life patients with early-stage breast cancer. This is a prospective , multicenter , post-marketing study that evaluates the efficacy and safety of docetaxel-based regimens in patients with early breast cancer treated between 2007 and 2012. A total of 698 female breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant docetaxel-based regimens were included in this study. Docetaxel monotherapy was administered in 4.2 % , whilst most patients received polychemotherapy. Non-hematological adverse events included skin reactions in 32.7 % of the subjects. Multiple adverse events were reported and most commonly included asthenia<symptom> ( 66.5 %) , alopecia ( 43.4 %) , and diarrhea<disease> ( 24.2 %). It is noteworthy that no fatal toxicities occurred. Several hematological adverse events were reported during treatment , with anemia<symptom> being the most common. The results of this real-life experience , characterized by a relatively large sample size and long follow-up , confirm that docetaxel is effective and well tolerated in early-stage breast cancer patients.
