  Acute diarrheal diseases are causes of global public health concern , especially in developing countries. A variety of diarrhea-associated microbial species , including bacteria , viruses , and protozoa , have been recognized. Simplified methods for detecting a wide range of diarrheagenic enteric microbes can clarify the etiology and aid in the diagnosis of diarrheal diseases. Here , we report a quantitative real-time ( q) PCR-based method for simultaneous detection of 24 targets from 19 microbes suspected of causing diarrhea<disease> in stool<symptom> specimens. We first selected the 24 oligonucleotide primer sets and hydrolysis probes conjugated with the fluorescent reporter dyes FAM , NED , or ABY , along with an internal control , and the passive reference dye ROX to establish a single-plate panel assay. The 12-duplex qPCR panel showed high linearity , with R
