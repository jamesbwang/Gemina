  In the current study , we sought to evaluate the diagnostic efficacies of conventional ultrasound ( US) , contrast-enhanced US ( CEUS) , combined US and CEUS and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) in detecting focal solid breast lesions<symptom>. Totally 117 patients with 120 BI-RADS category 4A-5 breast lesions<symptom> were evaluated by conventional US and CEUS , and MRI , respectively. SonoVue was used as contrast agent in CEUS and injected as an intravenous bolus; nodule<disease> scan was performed 4 minutes after bolus injection. A specific sonographic quantification software was used to obtain color-coded maps of perfusion parameters for the investigated lesion<symptom> , namely the time-intensity curve. The pattern of contrast enhancement and related indexes regarding the time-intensity curve were used to describe the lesions<symptom> , comparatively with pathological results. Histopathologic examination revealed 46 benign and 74 malignant lesions<symptom>. Sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy of US in detecting malignant breast lesions<symptom> were 90.14 % , 95.92 % , and 92.52 % , respectively. Meanwhile , CE-MRI showed sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy of 88.73 % , 95.92 % , and 91.67 % , respectively. The area under the ROC curve for combined US and CEUS in discriminating benign from malignant breast lesions<symptom> was 0.936 , while that of MRI was 0.923 , with no significant difference between them , as well as among groups. The time-intensity curve of malignant hypervascular fibroadenoma and papillary lesions<symptom> mostly showed a fast-in/fast-out pattern , with no good correlation between them ( kappa < 0.20). In conclusion , the combined use of conventional US and CEUS displays good agreement with MRI in differentiating benign from malignant breast
