  Innate , inflammatory responses towards persistent Opisthorchis viverrini ( OV) infection are likely to contribute to the development of cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA) , a liver cancer that is rare in the West<disease> but prevalent in Greater Mekong Subregion countries in Southeast Asia. Infection results in the infiltration of innate immune cells into the bile ducts and subsequent activation of inflammatory immune responses that fail to clear OV but instead may damage local tissues within the bile ducts. Not all patients infected with OV develop CCA , and so tumourigenesis may be dependent on multiple factors including the magnitude of the inflammatory response that is activated in infected individuals. The purpose of this review is to summarize how innate immune responses may promote tumourigenesis following OV infection and if such responses can be used to predict CCA onset in OV-infected individuals. It also hypothesizes on the role that Helicobacterspp. , which are associated with liver fluke infections , may play in activation of the innate the immune system to promote tissue damage and persistent inflammation<symptom> leading to CCA.
