  The aim of this work was a retrospective assessment of the quality of treatment , depending on the severity of polymorbidity ( PM) in patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) before admission to acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS). Retrospectively , 105 patients were included in the analysis ( 54 men ( 51,4 %) , mean age 65,94 ± 9,34 years) who had AF before hospitalization for ACS. The index of polymorbidity ( IPM) was assessed by ME Charlson et al. ( 1987) in the modification of H. Quan et al. ( 2005). The M ± σ , the Student 's coefficient , χ2 were calculated. Patients were ranked according to the IPM: the moderate degree of PM was revealed in 40 % , the severe degree of PM- in 60 % of patients. The group with a moderate degree of PM included patients aged 58,91 ± 6,95 years , in the group with a severe degree of PM age was 70,63 ± 7,65 years ( p.
