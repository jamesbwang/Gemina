  Close contact investigation is the essential key in tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) case finding and an effective strategy for TB control program within any society. In this prospective study , 1186 close family contacts of hospitalized TB patients ( index) in a referral TB hospital in Tehran-Iran were passively studied. These people were studied to rollout TB infection and disease. Demographic characteristics , clinical and laboratory data of these individuals were reviewed and summarized for analysis. A total of 886 ( 74.4 %) close-family contacts completed their investigation. The index TB patients of these individuals were sputum<symptom> smear negative for acid-fast bacilli in 137 cases ( 11.6 %) and the rest were smear positive. A total of 610 ( 68.8 %) close-family contact ruled out for TB infection or disease ( Group I). A total of 244 cases ( 27.5 %) had latent TB infection ( Group II) and active TB ( Group III) was confirmed in 32 cases ( 3.6 %). A significant difference was shown for female gender , signs and symptoms , family size , and positive radiological finding between Group I and Group II. The study of index parameter including positive sputum<symptom> smear/culture did not reveal any significant difference , but positive cavitary lesion<symptom> significantly more has seen in active TB group ( This study emphasizes on sign and symptoms and radiological finding in TB contact investigation , where index parameters including positive smear/culture , does not implicate any priority. Although cavitary lesions<symptom> in index patient have more accompanied by active TB , close contact study should include all of TB indexes. This investigation should include chest radiography for these individuals.
