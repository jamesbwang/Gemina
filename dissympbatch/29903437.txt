  More than a century after the description of its cardinal components , the cerebellar motor syndrome<disease> ( CMS) remains a cornerstone of daily clinical ataxiology , in both children and adults. Anatomically , motor cerebellum involves lobules I-V , VI , and VIII. CMS is typically associated with errors in the metrics of voluntary movements and a lack of coordination. Symptoms and motor signs consist of speech deficits , impairments of limb<symptom> movements<symptom> , and abnormalities of posture/gait. Ataxic dysarthria<symptom> has a typical scanning ( explosive with staccato) feature , voice has a nasal character , and speech is slurred. Cerebellar mutism is most common in children and occurs after resection of a large midline cerebellar tumor. Ataxia<symptom> of limbs includes at various degrees dysmetria ( hypermetria: overshoot , hypometria: undershoot) , dysdiadochokinesia , cerebellar tremor<symptom> ( action tremor<symptom> , postural tremor<symptom> , kinetic tremor<symptom> , some forms of orthostatic tremor<symptom>) , isometrataxia , disorders of muscle<symptom> tone ( both hypotonia and cerebellar fits) , and impaired check and rebound. Handwriting is irregular and some patients exhibit megalographia. Cerebellar patients show an increased body sway with a broad-based stance ( ataxia<symptom> of stance). Gait is irregular and staggering. Delayed learning of complex motor skills may be a prominent feature in children. CMS is currently explained by the inability of the cerebellum to handle feedback signals during slow movements and to create , store , select , and update internal models during fast movements. The cerebellum is embedded in large-scale brain networks and is essential to perform accurate motor predictions related to body dynamics and environmental stimuli. Overall , the observations in children and adults exhibiting a CMS fit with the hypothesis that the cerebellum contains neural representations reproducing the dynamic properties of body , and generates and calibrates sensorimotor predictions. Therapies aiming at a reinforcement or restoration of internal models should be implemented to cancel CMS in cerebellar ataxias<symptom>. The developmental trajectory of the cerebellum , the immature motor behavior in children , and the networks implicated in CMS need to be taken into account.
