  Fluid therapy guided by cardiac output measurements is of particular importance for adequate cerebral perfusion and oxygenation in neurosurgical patients. We examined the usefulness of a noninvasive electrical velocimetry ( EV) device based on the thoracic bioimpedance method for perioperative hemodynamic monitoring in patients after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom>. In total , 18 patients who underwent surgical clipping or endovascular coiling for ruptured aneurysms<disease> were examined prospectively. Simultaneous cardiac index ( CI) measurements obtained with EV ( CIEV) and reference transpulmonary thermodilution ( CITPTD) were compared. A total of 223 pairs of data were collected. A significant correlation was found between CIEV and CITPTD ( r = 0.86; P < 0.001). Bland and Altman analysis revealed a bias between CIEV and CITPTD of -0.06 L/min/m , with limits of agreement of ± 1.14 L/min/m and a percentage error of 33 %. Although the percentage error for overall data was higher than the acceptable limit of 30 % , subgroup analysis during the postoperative phase showed better agreement ( 23 % vs. 42 % during the intraprocedure phase). Four-quadrant plot and polar plot analyses showed fair-to-poor trending abilities ( concordance rate of 90 % to 91 % , angular bias of +17 degrees , radial limits of agreement between ± 37 and ± 40 degrees , and polar concordance rate of 72 % to 75 %) , including the subgroup analysis. Absolute CI values obtained from EV and TPTD are not interchangeable with TPTD for perioperative use in subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> patients. However , considering the moderate levels of agreement with marginal trending ability during the early postoperative phase , this user-friendly device can provide an attractive monitoring option during neurocritical care.
