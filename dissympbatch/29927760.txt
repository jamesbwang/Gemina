  A 3-year-old pediatric patient with previously diagnosed Pelizaeus-Merzbacher syndrome<disease> presented for outpatient dental restoration. Given the infrequency of this demyelinating disorder , an anesthetic plan was tailored to address the patient 's hypotonia and aspiration risk , as well as minimize potential complications including seizures<symptom> , hemodynamic<symptom> instability<symptom> , and postoperative respiratory support. Multimodal analgesia , along with an appropriate ventilation strategy and normothermia , allowed the patient to successfully undergo a general anesthetic and be safely discharged home the same day.
