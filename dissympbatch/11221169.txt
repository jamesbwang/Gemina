  We describe the unique case of a child with pneumonia<disease> presenting with acute scoliosis and abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , without any typical features of the disease.A 10-year-old girl presented to the emergency department on 3 consecutive days with right-sided abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> There were no associated features , in particular , no fevers<symptom> or respiratory<symptom> symptoms<symptom>. On the first 2 presentations , observation , examination , and blood test findings were unremarkable. Chest x-ray and abdominal ultrasound were also normal. On the third presentation a marked scoliosis was noted and abdominal examination revealed right-sided tenderness<symptom> with rebound. The patient was admitted and a computed tomographic scan of the abdomen arranged. Unexpectedly , this revealed a right lower lobe pneumonia<disease> and associated pleural effusion<symptom>. Despite treatment , the parapneumonic effusion<symptom> enlarged rapidly and she developed respiratory distress , necessitating transfer to a tertiary centre.The diagnosis of pneumonia<disease> can be challenging because of a lack of respiratory signs , the masking of systemic features by antipyretic effects of first-line analgesics , and a high rate of false-negative chest radiographs. The development of acute scoliosis should lead the clinician to strongly consider pneumonia<disease> in such circumstances.
