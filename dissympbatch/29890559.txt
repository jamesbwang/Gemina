  Eosinophilic colitis<disease> is a rare clinical condition that belongs to the group of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders. Its occurrence can be primary or secondary to infection , medications , or autoimmune/hematological conditions. We present a case of a young female adult with severe chronic<symptom> fatigue<symptom> syndrome<symptom> , widespread chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , including functional abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , who developed severe eosinophilic colitis<disease> following successive treatments with gabapentin and pregabalin. On both occasions , symptoms manifested as abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , diarrhea<disease> , and eosinophilia and improved upon discontinuation of the medications. Magnetic resonance imaging of the small bowel demonstrated an ascending colon colitis<disease> , and endoscopic investigations confirmed florid colitis<disease> mainly in the ascending colon with biopsies demonstrating a dense eosinophilic infiltrate with micro-abscesses. Serum eosinophil counts correlated well with the timing of the agents ' administration. There was no other organ involvement. Symptoms improved upon discontinuation of the drugs and steroid administration. Eosinophilic colitis<disease> is an exceptionally rare entity and its mechanism of action is still unclear. Suspicion of eosinophilic colitis<disease> should be raised if a patient presents with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , diarrhea<disease> , and peripheral eosinophilia following treatment with pregabalin or gabapentin.
