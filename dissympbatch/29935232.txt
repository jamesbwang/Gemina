  Individuals with Down syndrome<disease> ( DS) , a genetic condition due to triplication of Chromosome 21 , are characterized by intellectual disability that worsens with age. Since impairment of neurogenesis and dendritic maturation are very likely key determinants of intellectual disability in DS , interventions targeted to these defects may translate into a behavioral benefit. While most of the neurogenesis enhancers tested so far in DS mouse models may pose some caveats due to possible side effects , substances naturally present in the human diet may be regarded as therapeutic tools with a high translational impact. Linoleic acid and oleic acid are major constituents of corn oil that positively affect neurogenesis and neuron maturation. Based on these premises , the goal of the current study was to establish whether treatment with corn oil improves hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent memory in the Ts65Dn model of DS. Four-month-old Ts65Dn and euploid mice were treated with saline or corn oil for 30 days. Evaluation of behavior at the end of treatment showed that Ts65Dn mice treated with corn oil underwent a large improvement in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Evaluation of neurogenesis and dendritogenesis showed that in treated Ts65Dn mice the number of new granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and their dendritic pattern became similar to those of euploid mice. In addition , treated Ts65Dn mice underwent an increase in body and brain<symptom> weight. This study shows for the first time that fatty acids have a positive impact on the brain of the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. These results suggest that a diet that is rich in fatty acids may exert beneficial effects on cognitive performance in individuals with DS without causing adverse effects.
