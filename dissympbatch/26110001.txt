  The aim of the present study was to assist rheumatologists in differentiating hypophosphatemic osteomalacia ( HO) from mimic rheumatology diseases. Clinical data was obtained from 9 patients with acquired HO , initially misdiagnosed as mimic rheumatologic diseases. The data were retrospectively analyzed and a literature review was performed. The etiology of the cases was as follows: Adefovir dipivoxil-induced Fanconi syndrome<disease> was present in 6 of the cases , 2 were tumors and 1 case was chronic nephropathy. The chief complaint was thoracic or back pain and arthralgia , followed by progressive<symptom> muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> and dramatic movement limitation. All patients were transferred to 3-6 hospitals for extended periods due to misdiagnosis with conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis , chronic arthritis<disease> , lumbar disc disease , osteoporosis and somatoform disorder. Hypophosphatemia was observed in the patients and bone scans revealed diffusely decreased tracer uptake , with multiple hot spots of fractured sites and involved joints. Furthermore , patients ' bone density was markedly low compared with the normal range for their age and sex. In the present study , 6 of the patients recovered when adefovir dipivoxil was stopped. In 1 case , hypophosphatemia was ameliorated following tumor resection. The remaining patients , 1 with sub-skull tumor and 1 with chronic kidney disease , had poor prognoses due to incurable diseases. In conclusion , diagnosing HO is challenging for rheumatologists and physicians. Basic examinations of electrolyte balance<symptom> and bone mineral density should be performed , as should tumor screening and a careful collection of patient medical history and drugs in young patients with unexplained thoracic or back pain and muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom>. Removing any secondary etiology , such as drugs may dramatically improve the patients clinical manifestations and result in an improved prognosis.
