  Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( anti-NMDAR) encephalitis<disease> is a well-recognised disorder , first fully characterised in 2007. The long-term sequelae reported thus far include relapses with typical , as well as partial aspects of the well-defined neuropsychiatric syndrome<disease>. Rarely , isolated atypical symptoms ( diplopia<symptom> , ataxia<symptom> and tremor<symptom>) have been reported as relapse phenomenon. We report a case of a patient with a remote history of likely anti-NMDAR encephalitis<disease> with the longest follow-up reported in the literature to date ( 22 years). The relapse presentation was of a purely upper motor neuron syndrome<disease> with a primary lateral sclerosis-like picture.
