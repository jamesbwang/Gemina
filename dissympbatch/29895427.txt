  Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG) is considered as a first line treatment for morbid obesity around the globe. Leakage and subsequent gastric fistula<disease> is the most dreadful complication , which may lead to serious morbidity and even mortality. To assess the safety and efficacy of fibrin glue application in the setting of gastric fistula<disease> after LSG. University hospital , Israel. Twenty-four morbidly obese patients ( mean age = 42.2 yr , mean body mass index = 42 kg/m There were no complications except abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> in 2 patients associated with fever<disease> in 1. Both resolved within 1 to 2 days. Fistula<disease> closure was achieved in all patients but 1 ( 95.8 %). Closure was accomplished after a single application in 9 patients ( 39 %) , 2 applications in 8 , 3 applications in 3 , 5 applications in 2 , and 6 applications in 1. All patients were followed with a mean time of 42.3 months ( range , 20-46). Although in most patients there was a need for multiple applications , our experience indicates that percutaneous fluoroscopic application of Fibrin glue under endoscopic visualization proved to be a simple , tolerable , and highly effective method for the treatment of selected patients with gastric fistula<disease> after LSG.
