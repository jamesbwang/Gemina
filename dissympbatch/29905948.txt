  Water and protein are major constituents of shrimp<disease> , any changes in protein and the state of water influence the quality of shrimp<disease>. Therefore , a study to examine the law of moisture migration and protein denaturation under different freezing and thawing conditions is important. The proton density images of thawed frozen-shrimp revealed that the water loss during quick-freezing was much greater than that during slow freezing or microfreezing. At room temperature ( 25 Â°C) , the water loss from brine-thawing was more than still-water thawing and still-water thawing was more than thawing spontaneously. Freezing-thawing resulted in uniform water redistribution in shrimp<disease> muscle. Nuclear magnetic resonance technology ( low field magnetic imaging) was used to directly monitor the dynamic processes of fluidity state in shrimp<disease> and indirectly monitor protein denaturation and thereby determine the optimal method of freezing-thawing shrimp<disease>. Our research showed that microfreezing preservation minimized weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , juice leakage and protein denaturation in shrimp<disease> muscle during thawing. Water is one of the major components in most organs and is an important factor that influences the shrimp<disease> muscle quality. Water migration patterns and subsequent effects on the shrimp<disease> muscle under different freezing and thawing conditions were examined using low field nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR) technology. This research provides a theoretical foundation for shrimp<disease> processing plants to improve the freezing and thawing process to obtain optimal quality and flavor of shrimp<disease> products.
