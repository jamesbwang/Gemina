  Rapid eye movement<symptom> ( REM) sleep behavior disorder ( RBD) is characterized by repeated episodes of REM sleep-related vocalizations and/or complex motor behaviors. Definite diagnosis of RBD is based on history and polysomnography , both of which are less accessible due to the lack of trained specialists and high cost. While RBD may be associated with disorders like narcolepsy , focal brain lesions<symptom> , and encephalitis<disease> , idiopathic RBD ( iRBD) may convert to Parkinson 's disease ( PD) and other synucleinopathies in more than 80 % of patients and it is to date the most specific clinical prodromal marker of PD. Identification of individuals at high risk for development of PD is becoming one of the most important topics for current PD-related research as well as for future treatment trials targeting prodromal PD. Furthermore , concomitant clinical symptoms , such as subtle motor impairment , hyposmia , autonomic dysfunction , or cognitive difficulties , in subjects with iRBD may herald its phenoconversion to clinically manifest parkinsonism. The assessment of these motor and non-motor symptoms in iRBD may increase the sensitivity and specificity in identifying prodromal PD subjects. This review evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of individual rating scales and validated single items for screening of RBD and the role and accuracy of available clinical , electrophysiological , imaging , and tissue biomarkers in predicting the phenoconversion from iRBD to clinically manifest synucleinopathies.
