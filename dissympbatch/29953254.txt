  Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) is a complex disorder that is associated with significant morbidity. While many recent advances have been made with new diagnostic and therapeutic tools , a deeper understanding of its basic pathophysiology is needed to continue this trend towards improving treatments. By utilizing an unbiased , high-throughput transcriptomic analysis of two well-established mouse models of colitis<disease> , we set out to uncover novel coding and non-coding RNAs that are differentially expressed in the setting of colonic inflammation<symptom>. RNA-seq analysis was performed using colonic tissue from two mouse models of colitis<disease> , a dextran sodium sulfate induced model and a genetic-induced model in mice lacking IL-10. We identified 81 coding RNAs that were commonly altered in both experimental models. Of these coding RNAs , 12 of the human orthologs were differentially expressed in a transcriptomic analysis of IBD patients. Interestingly , 5 of the 12 of human differentially expressed genes have not been previously identified as IBD-associated genes , including ubiquitin D. Our analysis also identified 15 non-coding RNAs that were differentially expressed in either mouse model. Surprisingly , only three non-coding RNAs were commonly dysregulated in both of these models. The discovery of these new coding and non-coding RNAs expands our transcriptional knowledge of mouse models of IBD and offers additional targets to deepen our understanding of the pathophysiology of IBD.
