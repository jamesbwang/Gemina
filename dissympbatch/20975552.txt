  Glycemic excursions are commonly seen in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit ( ICU) and are related to adverse outcomes. Glycemic gap is a marker of this excursion in patients with diabetes. It can be used to predict adverse outcomes in patients with diabetes admitted to the ICU. It is calculated by subtracting A1C-derived average glucose ( ADAG) = ( ( 28.7 × HbA1c) -46.7) from plasma glucose at admission. Objective of this study was to correlate glycemic gap and adverse outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM) admitted to the ICU. We conducted an ambispective study to include patients with type 2 DM admitted to the ICUs from July 2015 to June 2016. The following adverse outcomes were recorded: Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome<disease> ( MODS) , acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> ( ARDS) , shock<symptom> , upper gastrointestinal ( UGI) bleed , acute kidney injury ( AKI) , and acute<disease> respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> ( ARF). A total of 200 patients were enrolled , with a mean age ± standard deviation of 62 ± 11.24 years , and 64.5 % were males. The median ( interquartile range) duration of hospital stay and ICU stay were 8 ( 6-12) days and 4 ( 3-7) days , respectively. The most common primary diagnosis was cardiovascular ( 39.5 %) followed by neurological ( 16.5 %) , infection at diagnosis ( 16.5 %) , respiratory ( 14 %) , gastrointestinal ( 7.5 %) , and others ( 6 %). A higher glycemic gap was associated with occurrence of MODS ( This study showed that higher glycemic gap levels were associated with an increased risk of MODS , ARDS , shock<symptom> , UGI bleed , AKI , and ARF. Glycemic gap is a tool that can be used to determine prognosis in patients with diabetes admitted to the ICU.
