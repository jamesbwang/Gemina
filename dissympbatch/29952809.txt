  Pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR) is recommended for bronchiectasis , but there is little evidence of its efficacy in these patients. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of PR in normally nourished patients with noncystic fibrosis<disease> bronchiectasis compared with the effect of PR plus an oral nutritional supplement ( PRONS). A single-center randomized controlled trial , parallel treatment design in which participants were randomly assigned to receive PR for 12 wk or PR plus a high-protein nutritional supplement enriched with beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate. Outcome assessments were performed at baseline , 12 and 24 wk including cardiopulmonary exercise testing , health-related quality of life ( HRQOL) , bronchorrhea , dyspnea<symptom> , psychological symptoms , spirometry , and exacerbations. Thirty patients were randomized into 2 groups of 15 participants. In both groups , cardiopulmonary exercise testing , HRQOL , dyspnea<symptom> , and spirometry parameters significantly increased from baseline at 3 and/or 6 mo.. PR improved exercise capacity , HRQOL , and respiratory parameters. The use of PRONS did not have a significant effect on the results.
