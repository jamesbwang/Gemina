  Cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by CFTR mutations. It is characterized by high NaCl concentration in sweat<symptom> and the production of a thick and sticky mucus , occluding secretory ducts , intestine and airways , accompanied by chronic inflammation<symptom> and infections of the lungs. This causes a progressive and lethal decline in lung function. Therefore , finding the mechanisms driving the high susceptibility to lung<disease> infections<disease> has been a key issue. For decades the prevalent hypothesis was that a reduced airway surface liquid ( ASL) volume and composition , and the consequent increased mucus concentration ( dehydration<symptom> , create an environment favoring infections. However , a few years ago , in a pig model of CF , the Na
