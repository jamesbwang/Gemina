  We report a case of cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome<disease> accompanied by postoperative intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> following blood flow reconstruction for quasi-moyamoya disease associated with Graves ' disease that had caused cerebral infarctions. A 44-year-old woman presented with repeated sensory impairment of the fingers on the left hand and weakness<symptom> of the right<symptom> lower limb and multiple cerebral infarctions developed in the bilateral frontal lobes. Magnetic resonance angiography and cerebral angiography suggested quasi-moyamoya disease. On hospitalization , untreated Graves ' disease was identified and treated first. Revascularization was performed in the region of the right middle cerebral artery , where reduced cerebral blood flow and depressed vascular reactivity persisted half a year after treatment of Graves ' disease , but postoperative cerebral hemorrhage<symptom> appeared after 5 days due to hyperperfusion syndrome<disease> around the anastomotic site. Lethal hyperperfusion syndrome<disease> following revascularization of quasi-moyamoya disease associated with Graves ' disease appears very rare and has not been reported previously.
