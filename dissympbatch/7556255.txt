  Jugular bulb anomalies are asymptomatic lesions<symptom> commonly seen in routine practice. However , some patients with jugular bulb anomalies may present with symptoms such as tinnitus<symptom> or conductive hearing loss ( CHL). A 9 year old boy complained right sided hearing disturbance without any vestibular symptoms. Pure tone audiometry ( PTA) revealed a mild right sided conductive hearing loss. Otoscopy showed a red-purplish mass like lesion<symptom> in his right middle ear cavity , which was regarded as hypervascular tumor. Based on otoscopic findings , preliminary differential diagnoses included jugular bulb anomaly , hemotympanum , cholesterol granuloma<disease> and paraganglioma. We performed contrast enhanced computed tomography of the temporal bone ( TBCT). CT scan showed and enhancing lesion<symptom> which was bulging from his right jugular foramen to the middle ear with dehiscent jugular bulb. The lesion<symptom> showed the same degree of contrast enhancement with the venous vasculature. This lesion<symptom> contacted with the tympanic membrane , incudostapedial joint and round window , which might be attributable to interruption of sound transmission mechanics. Otherwise there was no evidence of mass or trauma related lesions<symptom> in the temporal bone. Although most of jugular bulb anomalies are asymptomatic , patients may present with conductive hearing loss due to the interference of sound transmission mechanics.
