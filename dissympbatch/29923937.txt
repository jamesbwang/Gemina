  To assess pulmonary functions of children who received mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom>. Longitudinal study. PICU and Pediatric Pulmonology Clinic of a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India. All children , 5-12 years old , ventilated for acute hypoxemic respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> in PICU from July 2012 to June 2013 and survived. The baseline admission variables recorded were as follows: age , sex , duration of illness , primary diagnosis at admission , Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score , lung injury score , mechanical ventilation parameters , oxygenation indices , and duration of PICU stay. The children were followed up twice , at 3 and 9-12 months , after discharge from PICU and evaluated for any residual respiratory<symptom> symptoms<symptom> and signs , pulse oximetry , chest radiograph , 6-minute walk test , peak expiratory flow rate , and spirometry. Age , sex , duration of illness , primary diagnosis , Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score , lung injury score , mechanical ventilation parameters , oxygenation indices ( PaO2/FIO2 ratio and oxygenation index) , and duration of PICU stay were recorded from patient records. Twenty-nine children ( 25 boys and four girls; mean ( SD) age , 8.4 ( 2.4) yr) were followed up at 3.5 ( ± 1.2) and 10.6 ( ± 2.7) months after discharge from PICU. Recurrent respiratory<symptom> symptoms<symptom> were noted in 37.9 % patients ( 11/29) during first and in none during second follow-up. None had limitation of physical activity or need of supplemental oxygen. Chest examination was normal in all , except one during first follow-up , but 13.8 % ( 4/29) had abnormal chest radiograph during first follow-up. Nearly all children could perform 6-minute walk test although mean distance walked increased significantly from first ( 352 ± 66.7 m) to second follow-up ( 401 ± 60.7 m; p = 0.002). Abnormal spirometry was seen in 82.7 % ( 24/29) versus 18.5 % ( 5/27) children during first and second follow-up visits , respectively ( p = 0.0001). Most cases had restrictive abnormality ( 58.6 % vs 11.1 %; p = 0.002) during first and second follow-up , respectively. There was no correlation between pulmonary functions and lung injury scores , oxygenation indices ( PaO2/FIO2 ratio and oxygenation index) , and mechanical ventilation parameters. Significant number of children ventilated for acute hypoxemic respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> had subclinical pulmonary function abnormality , without limiting physical activity , which improved over time. Further research on this topic with a larger sample size and patient categorization according to recent pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> definition is needed.
