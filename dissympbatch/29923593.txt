Hintonia latiflora ( Hl) is a tree native to the American continent belonging to the Rubiaceae family and its stem bark is empirically used mainly to treat diabetes and malaria<disease> supplements containing Hl are sold in America and Europe without medical prescription , thus scientific information regarding its toxicity as a consequence of a regular consumption is needed. In the present study , the histopathological effect of 200 and 1000 mg/kg of Hintonia latiflora methanolic stem bark extract ( HlMeOHe) was evaluated in the small bowel , liver , pancreas , kidneys and brain of CD-1 male mice after oral sub-acute treatment for 28 days. No histopathological alterations were observed in the brain and small bowel of the treated animals; however , mice presented diarrhea<disease> from day 2 of treatment with both doses. No histological changes were observed in the tissues collected from the animals treated with 200 mg/ kg , except for the liver that depicted periportal hepatitis<disease>. Animals treated with the higher dose showed in the liver sections hydropic degeneration , hepatitis<disease> and necrosis<symptom> , kidney sections depicted tubular necrosis<symptom> and in pancreas sections , hydropic degeneration of the pancreatic islets was observed. In conclusion , HlMeOHe damaged the liver with an oral dose of 200 mg/kg , and at 1000 mg/kg injured the kidneys and pancreas of the CD-1 male mice.
