  Cerebellar mutism most commonly , but not exclusively , develops in children after surgery for midline cerebellar or intraventricular tumors in the posterior fossa , typically medulloblastoma. Cerebellar mutism syndrome<disease> ( CMS) comprises a complex set of neurologic and neurocognitive signs and symptoms , the cardinal and central component of which is an initially profound but usually reversible speech disorder. As such , CMS is currently recognized as an extreme form of the so-called cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome<disease> ( Schmahmann syndrome<disease>). The putative cause of CMS is a substantial surgical injury to the proximal components of the bilateral efferent cerebellar pathways , disrupting cerebellar input to the supratentorial brain. The resultant cerebellocerebral diaschisis may lead to supratentorial cortical perfusion depression<symptom> with frontal predominance. The speech disorder is , therefore , likely an apraxia. As our understanding of the mechanism and the clinical spectrum of CMS evolves , clinically useful preoperative risk stratification schemes , adjustments to surgical strategies and techniques , and possible early therapeutic-rehabilitative measures are being sought and developed to reduce the burden of this severe and particularly handicapping chronic morbidity on affected individuals and their families.
