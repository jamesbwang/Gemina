  α-Mangostin ( αMN) is a xanthone present in the pericarp of Garcinia mangostana Linn. which is mentioned in Ayurveda and is a widely used functional food supplement. However , its anti-inflammatory mechanism is not well studied. Hence , we used in silico , in vitro and in vivo models to provide information of the mechanism on how αMN could prevent inflammation<symptom>. Firstly , molecular docking was used to find out the binding energy of αMN with NFκB and COX proteins. Secondly , LPS induced RAW 264.7 cells were used to measure the production of cytokines , the prevention of translocation of NFκB and the inhibition of COX-1 and -2 enzymes. Finally , carrageenan-induced peritonitis<disease> was used in vivo to check cytokine release , leukocyte migration and vascular permeability. The in silico modelling had showed that αMN has the lowest binding energy with COX-2 and NFκB proteins. αMN has been found to inhibit the production of PGE2 and nitric oxide , and iNOS protein expression. TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines were inhibited significantly ( p < 0.05) at 8 and 14 μg ml-1 concentration. αMN at higher doses inhibits the translocation of NFκB together with suppressing the COX-2 enzymes , but not COX-1. αMN inhibited the total leukocyte migration , predominantly , neutrophils in vivo. The level of TNFα and IL-1β was significantly ( p < 0.05) reduced in the peritoneal fluids as measured by ELISA analysis. Taken together , these results demonstrate that αMN acts well as an anti-inflammatory agent via inhibiting the hallmark mechanisms of inflammation<symptom>. It can be considered as a potential alternative lead compound. In addition , the current results support the traditional use of this fruit pericarp as a functional food.
