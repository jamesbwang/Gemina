  Within the cattle fever<disease> tick quarantine zone along the Rio Grande , a steady displacement of native vegetation by Arundo donax L. has been occurring for over a century. Arundo rapidly grows to a height of 3-6 m creating a dense wall of vegetation impeding surveillance and interception of stray cattle breaching the cattle fever<disease> tick quarantine from Mexico. Additionally , arundo monocultures may decrease the number and diversity of predatory beetles feeding on cattle fever<disease> ticks. To compare predatory beetle abundance and diversity within and between arundo and native vegetation , beetles were trapped at 10 locations twice a month for 16 mo ( = 38,400 trap nights<symptom>) in the cattle fever<disease> tick quarantine zone along the Mexico-American border between Brownsville and Del Rio , TX. In total , 766 beetles were trapped , which included 34 genera and 43 species. Native vegetation provided more beetles , greater species richness , and increased biological diversity. Thus , greater beetle diversity was found in the more complex native vegetation compared with arundo stands. However , because predatory beetle sample numbers were modest , it is unlikely these mostly polyphagous , opportunistic arthropod predators would apply much pressure on tick populations , leading us to conclude that beetle predation would have little effect on tick populations in native vegetation or within stands of arundo.
