  To test the hypothesis that insulin resistance is associated with depression<symptom> risk in polycystic ovary syndrome<disease> ( PCOS). Secondary analysis of data from a multicenter randomized trial. Multicenter university-based clinical practices. Seven hundred thirty-eight women with PCOS by modified Rotterdam criteria seeking pregnancy enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing clomiphene citrate versus letrozole. The Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Patient Health Questionnaire was self-administered to identify depression<symptom> using a validated algorithm at enrollment. Demographic and anthropometric data were collected , and serum assays were performed. Insulin resistance was estimated using the homeostatic model of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR) , with a cutoff of > 2.2 considered abnormal. Demographic , endocrine , and metabolic parameters associated with depression<symptom> In a univariate logistic regression analysis , elevated HOMA-IR was associated with 2.3-fold increased odds of depression<symptom> ( odds ratio ( OR) = 2.32; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.28-4.21). This association remained significant after controlling for age and body mass index ( adjusted OR ( aOR) = 2.23; 95 % CI , 1.11-4.46) and in a model including additional potential confounders ( aOR = 2.03; 95 % CI , 1.00-4.16). Insulin resistance has a strong and independent association with depression<symptom> in PCOS and may serve as a physiologic mediator. Our findings corroborate a growing body of evidence linking insulin resistance to depressed mood. The association between insulin resistance and depressed mood warrants further investigation to elucidate mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets.
