  De Garengeot hernia was first described in 1731. It is rare type of hernia and there is no established mode of treatment for it to date. This work has been reported in line with the SCARE criteria ( Agha et al. , 2016). We present a case of a 72 years old male with a non-reducible right inguinal swelling diagnosed to be a femoral hernia with congested appendix within. There are less than 100 cases like this reported to date in the literature. Acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> within the femoral hernia is not a common problem to cross paths with. Prompt early treatment is recommended and directed at repairing the hernia after appendectomy. The method of treatment is controversial and not well established due to the scarcity of cases but open repair without mesh is the preferred approach. De Garengeot hernia is a rare hernia to encounter. Imaging modalities are a major tool in early diagnosis and early prompt surgery is crucial in preventing major complications that may lead to unnecessary morbidity and mortality.
