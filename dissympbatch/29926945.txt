  While plaque-induced gingivitis<disease> is one of the most common human inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> , several non-plaque-induced gingival diseases are less common but often of major significance for patients. The non-plaque-induced gingival lesions<symptom> are often manifestations of systemic conditions , but they may also represent pathologic changes limited to gingival tissues. A classification is proposed , based on the etiology of the lesions<symptom> and includes: Genetic/Developmental disorders; Specific infections; Inflammatory and immune conditions and lesions<symptom>; Reactive processes; Neoplasms; Endocrine , Nutritional and metabolic diseases; Traumatic lesions<symptom>; and Gingival pigmentation.
