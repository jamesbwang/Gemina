  The present study aimed to investigate the long-term risk of hemorrhagic stroke ( HS) in patients with infective endocarditis<disease> ( IE). Using a register-based nationwide cohort of 9 million Danes , we propensity score-matched patients with left-sided IE from 1977 to mid-2015 with IE-free individuals ( 1:10). Follow up started one year after the IE diagnosis. Hazard ratios ( HRs) for HS in IE patients compared to the matched cohort were estimated using Cox regression. During follow-up of 5,735 IE patients with left sided IE from one year after IE diagnosis and up to 37 · 5 years ( median 6 · 3 years) , 103 cases of HS were observed. Compared to the matched cohort , IE patients had higher long-term risk of HS ( HR 1 · 47; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1 · 20-1 · 80; p = 0.0002). The risk of HS was particularly increased in patients within the lowest propensity score quartile ( HR 2 · 60; 95 % CI 1 · 89-3 · 58). Mediation analyses suggested that the increased HS risk could be explained by an indirect effect of insertion of a mechanical heart valve , atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> or treatment with anticoagulants. The cumulative risk of HS 30 years after start of follow-up was 3 · 0 % in IE patients. IE does not directly increase the long-term risk of HS. The apparent excess risk of HS in patients with previous IE was explained by mediating factors; mechanical heart valve insertion , atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> and anticoagulation medication.
