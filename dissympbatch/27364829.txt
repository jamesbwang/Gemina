  Developing new methods to treat heart diseases is always a focus for basic research and clinical applications. Existing drugs have strong side-effects and also require lifetime administration for patients. Recent attempts of using nanoparticles ( NPs) in treating atherosclerosis in animals and some heart diseases such as heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and endocarditis<disease> have provided hopes for better drug delivery and reducing of drug side-effects. In this mini-review , we summarize the present applications of using gold nanoparticles ( GNPs) as a new drug delivery system in diseased hearts and of the assessment of toxicity in using GNPs. We suggest that conjugating existing clinical drugs with GNPs is a favorable choice to provide `` new and double-enhanced '' potentiality to those existing drugs in treating heart diseases. Other applications of using NPs in the treatment of heart diseases including using drugs in nano-form and coating drugs with a surface of relevant NP are also discussed.
