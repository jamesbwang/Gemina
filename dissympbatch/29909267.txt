  The aim of this study was to make an accurate diagnosis of pyriform sinus fistula<disease> ( PSF) for prenatal diagnosis. Medical records were reviewed for all 35 pyriform sinus fistula<disease> patients presenting between 2011 and 2017. Ultrasonography ( US) , fetal magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) and karyotyping were offered during gestation , while computer tomography ( CT) and barium esophagography were performed after birth. Patients included 21 males ( 60 %) and 14 females ( 40 %) with a sex ratio of 1.5:1. The lesion<symptom> was located on the left side in 32 ( 91.4 %) cases , the right side in 2 ( 5.7 %) , and was bilateral ( 2.8 %) in only one case. The sensitivity of CT , MRI , ultrasonography and barium esophagography were 100 % ( 35/35) , 69.2 % ( 9/13) , 22.9 % ( 8/35) , and 80 % ( 20/25) , respectively. If the diagnosis was correct , there was almost no recurrence after treatment. Karyotype analysis of all fetuses was normal. Pyriform sinus fistula<disease> is more commonly seen in the left side. Compared with ultrasonography , MRI has more advantages in prenatal diagnosis , and it is more accurate in postpartum CT examination. The outcome of children with pyriform sinus fistula<disease> may be guarded when it correct diagnosis.
