  This study , for the first time , aimed to assess the effects of fermented camel milk ( FCM) on glycemic and inflammatory parameters related to metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) , an aggregation of cardiometabolic risk factors , in adolescents. In a double-blind , randomized crossover trial , overweight/obese adolescents ( fulfilling MetS criteria , aged 11-18 years) were randomly assigned to receive FCM 250 cc per day for an 8-week period , a 4-week washout , and then diluted cow 's yogurt ( DCY) 250 cc/day for another 8-week period , or the reverse sequence. Fasting blood sugar ( FBS) , fasting insulin , insulin resistance by three equations , incretin hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP) , and glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP1) as well as inflammatory markers such as interleukin 6 ( IL6) and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha ( TNF-Î±) were measured before and after each of the four periods. A 3-day food record and physical activity questionnaire were completed before each period. Statistical analyses were done using Minitab and SPSS software considering the significance level of 0.05. Twenty-four participants with a mean ( standard deviation) age of 13.77 ( 1.87) years ( range: 10.45-16.25 years) ( 58 % girls) completed the study. It resulted in nonsignificant mean reduction in IL6 ( -18.28 pg/mL ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): -47.48; 10.90); According to preliminary positive influences of FCM on inflammatory markers , and findings related to glucose metabolism , we suggest conducting further studies on its clinical impacts.
