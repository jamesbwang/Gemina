  Refractory ceramic fibers ( RCFs) are amorphous fibers that belong to a class of materials termed synthetic vitreous fibers ( SVFs) , also called man-made mineral fibers ( MMMFs) , which includes alkaline earth silicate wool , glass wool , rock ( stone) wool , slag wool , and special-purpose glass fibers. RCFs are more durable and biopersistent than several other SVFs , although very much less biopersistent than either amosite or crocidolite asbestos. Chronic inhalation studies indicated that rats and hamsters exposed to RCF fibers developed fibrosis<disease> and tumors. Epidemiological studies at the University of Cincinnati funded by the Industry indicated that exposed workers; ( 1) exhibited symptoms ( e.g. , dyspnea<symptom>) similar to those reported in other dust-exposed populations , ( 2) developed statistically , but not clinically , significant deficits in certain measures of pulmonary function in a cross sectional study , but no excessive decline in a longitudinal study , and ( 3) a dose related increase in pleural plaques , but no interstitial fibrosis<disease>. The 2003 mortality study indicated no incremental lung cancer and no cases of mesothelioma. RCF producers developed a comprehensive industry wide product stewardship program ( PSP) beginning in the late 1980s. In conjunction with the PSP , there has been a progressive decrease in the TWA concentration of fibers by manufacturers and end-users. The research program has successfully produced more soluble fibers and undertaken efforts to develop larger diameter fibers. The results of the ongoing epidemiology studies confirm that occupational exposure to RCF is associated with the development of pleural plaques and minor decrements in lung function , but no interstitial fibrosis<disease> or incremental lung cancer.
