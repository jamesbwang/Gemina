  Epicardial adipose tissue ( EAT) is associated with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) , but the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to examine , using human left atrial appendage ( LAA) samples , the interactive relationship between the EAT profile and atrial myocardial fibrosis<disease> through histologic and biochemical analyses. LAA samples were obtained from 59 consecutive AF patients during cardiovascular surgery. In histologic analysis , adipose tissue , atrial myocardial fibrosis<disease> , EAT fibrosis<disease> , macrophage infiltration , and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α ( Hif-1α) expression were evaluated in LAA sections. In biochemical analysis , proinflammatory/fibrotic proteins in EAT , total collagen in left atrial<symptom> ( LA) myocardium , angiopoietin-like protein-2 ( Angptl2)- related proteins in EAT , and proinflammatory/fibrotic proteins in serum were evaluated. Histology revealed that the severity of fibrotic remodeling of EAT was associated with LA myocardial fibrosis<disease>. Immunohistochemical and electron microscopic findings revealed that fibrotic remodeling of EAT was associated with infiltration of macrophages and myofibroblasts. Protein concentration analysis demonstrated that the total collagen in the LA myocardium was positively correlated with proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines/chemokines , including interleukin-6 , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α , vascular endothelial growth factor , and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in EAT. The proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines/chemokines in EAT and the total collagen in the LA were also positively correlated with Angptl2 in EAT. Our study demonstrated that fibrotic remodeling and cytokines/chemokines in peri-LA EAT were associated with atrial myocardial fibrosis<disease> as a substrate of AF. Our results also suggested that overexpression of Hif-1α and Angptl2 may be involved in these processes.
