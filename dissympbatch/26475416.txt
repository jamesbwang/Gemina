  Activation of the renin-angiotensin system ( RAS) is associated with hypertension and heart disease. However , how RAS activation causes cardiac lesions<symptom> remains elusive. Here we report the involvement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in this process. In rats with chronic infusion of angiotensin II ( Ang II) , eight Wnt ligands were induced and β-catenin activated in both cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. Blockade of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by small molecule inhibitor ICG-001 restrained Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy by normalizing heart size and inhibiting hypertrophic marker genes. ICG-001 also attenuated myocardial fibrosis<disease> and inhibited α-smooth muscle actin , fibronectin and collagen I expression. These changes were accompanied by a reduced expression of atrial natriuretic peptide and B-type natriuretic peptide. Interestingly , ICG-001 also lowered blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> induced by Ang II. In vitro , Ang II induced multiple Wnt ligands and activated β-catenin in rat primary cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. ICG-001 inhibited myocyte hypertrophy and Snail1 , c-Myc and atrial natriuretic peptide expression , and abolished the fibrogenic effect of Ang II in cardiac fibroblasts. Finally , recombinant Wnt3a was sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte injury and fibroblast activation in vitro. Taken together , these results illustrate an essential role for Wnt/β-catenin in mediating hypertension , cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis<disease>. Therefore , blockade of this pathway may be a novel strategy for ameliorating hypertensive heart disease.
