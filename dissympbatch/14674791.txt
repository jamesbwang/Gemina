  We investigated the pharmacokinetic ( PK) and pharmacodynamic ( PD) parameters of linezolid in patients who had suffered cerebral hemorrhage<symptom> after lateral ventricular drainage. Ten patients with cerebral hemorrhage<symptom> after lateral ventricular drainage with stroke-associated pneumonia<disease> who were given linezolid were enrolled. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) samples were taken at appropriate intervals after the first administration of linezolid and assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC). Then , PK parameters were estimated , and a Monte Carlo simulation was used to calculate the probability of target attainments ( PTAs) for linezolid achieving the PK/PD index at different minimal inhibitory concentrations ( MICs). The maximum concentration of linezolid in plasma and CSF was reached at 1.00 h and 3.10 h , respectively. The average penetration of linezolid in CSF was 56.81 %. If the area under the plasma concentration vs time curve from zero to the final sampling time ( AUC For patients with infection of the central nervous system and who are sensitive to the drug , the usual dosing regimens of linezolid can achieve a good therapeutic effect. However , for critically ill or drug-resistant patients , an increase in dose , the frequency of administration , or longer infusion may be needed to improve the curative effect.
