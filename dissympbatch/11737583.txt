  Birt-Hogg-Dube ' Syndrome<disease> ( BHDS) is a rare genetic disorder in humans characterized by skin hamartomas , lung cysts<symptom> , pneumothorax , and increased risk of renal tumors. BHDS is caused by mutations in the BHD gene , which encodes for Folliculin , a cytoplasmic adapter protein that binds to Folliculin interacting proteins-1 and -2 ( Fnip1 , Fnip2) as well as the master energy sensor AMP kinase ( AMPK). Whereas kidney-specific deletion of the Bhd gene in mice is known to result in polycystic kidney disease ( PKD) and renal cell carcinoma , the roles of Fnip1 in renal cell development and function are unclear. In this study , we utilized mice with constitutive deletion of the Fnip1 gene to show that the loss of Fnip1 is sufficient to result in renal cyst<symptom> formation , which was characterized by decreased AMPK activation , increased mTOR activation , and metabolic hyperactivation. Using RNAseq , we found that Fnip1 disruption resulted in many cellular and molecular changes previously implicated in the development of PKD in humans , including alterations in the expression of ion and amino acid transporters , increased cell adhesion , and increased inflammation<symptom>. Loss of Fnip1 synergized with Tsc1 loss to hyperactivate mTOR , increase Erk activation , and greatly accelerate the development of PKD. Our results collectively define roles for Fnip1 in regulating kidney development and function , and provide a model for how loss of Fnip1 contributes to PKD and perhaps renal cell carcinoma.
