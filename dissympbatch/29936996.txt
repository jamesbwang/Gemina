  The optimal timing of appendectomy for acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> has been analyzed with mixed results. We hypothesized that delayed appendectomy would be associated with increased 30-d morbidity and mortality. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for all patients undergoing nonelective appendectomy from 2012 to 2015 with a postoperative diagnosis of appendicitis<disease> Patients were grouped based on hospital day ( HD) of operation. Primary outcomes included 30-d mortality and major complications. Logistic regression was performed to determine predictors of major morbidity and mortality. From 2012 to 2015 , 112,122 patients underwent appendectomy for acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease>. Appendectomies performed on HD 3 had significantly worse outcomes as demonstrated by increased 30-d mortality ( 0.6 %) and all major postoperative complications ( 8 %) in comparison with operations taking place on HD 1 ( 0.1 %; 3.4 %) or HD 2 ( 0.1 % , P < 0.001; 3.6 % , P < 0.001). In subgroup analysis , open operations had significantly higher mortality and major postoperative complications , including organ/space surgical<disease> site<disease> infections<disease> ( 4.6 % open versus 2.1 % laparoscopic; P < 0.001). Patients with decreased baseline physical status by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status class had the worst outcomes ( 1.5 % mortality; 14 % major complications) when operation was delayed to HD 3. Logistic regression revealed higher American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status class and open operations as predictors of major complications; however , HD was not ( P = 0.2). Data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program demonstrate similar outcomes of appendectomy for acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> when the operation is performed on HD 1 or 2; however , outcomes are significantly worse for appendectomies delayed until HD 3. Increased complications in this group are likely not attributable to HD of operation , but rather decreased baseline health status and procedure type.
