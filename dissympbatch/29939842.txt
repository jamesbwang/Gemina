  This article reports a case of Kawasaki disease ( KD) and its rapid fatal course in a 5-year-old boy , who 3 days before hospitalization demonstrated fever<disease> and diffuse erythema in the face , neck , and torso , as well as swelling and pain below the right earlobe. During the admission , he was diagnosed with mumps<disease> and suspected scarlet fever<disease> Abnormal laboratory findings included elevated values of procalcitonin , C-reactive protein , and interleukin 6. Sudden death occurred 8 days after admission. Autopsy confirmed the cause of death to be pericardial tamponade due to a ruptured , inflamed aneurysm<disease> of the left anterior descending coronary artery. We believe that any typical clinical sign of KD whenever associated with elevated indices of inflammation<symptom> should set off suspicion of KD and further permit cardiovascular examination. This would contribute to distinguishing KD from other diseases with similar clinical signs in order to accelerate appropriate treatment.
