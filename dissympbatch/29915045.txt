  Although certain dogma portrays amyloid fibrils as drivers of neurodegenerative disease and neuroinflammation , we have found , paradoxically , that amyloid fibrils and small heat shock<symptom> proteins ( sHsps) are therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis<disease> ( EAE). They reduce clinical paralysis and induce immunosuppressive pathways , diminishing inflammation<symptom>. A key question was the identification of the target for these molecules. When sHsps and amyloid fibrils were chemically cross-linked to immune cells , a limited number of proteins were precipitated , including the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( α7 NAChR). The α7 NAChR is noteworthy among the over 20 known receptors for amyloid fibrils , because it plays a central role in a well-defined immune-suppressive pathway. Competitive binding between amyloid fibrils and α-bungarotoxin to peritoneal macrophages ( MΦs) confirmed the involvement of α7 NAChR. The mechanism of immune suppression was explored , and , similar to nicotine , amyloid fibrils inhibited LPS induction of a common set of inflammatory cytokines while inducing Stat3 signaling and autophagy. Consistent with this , previous studies have established that nicotine , sHsps , and amyloid fibrils all were effective therapeutics in EAE. Interestingly , B lymphocytes were needed for the therapeutic effect. These results suggest that agonists of α7 NAChR might have therapeutic benefit for a variety of
