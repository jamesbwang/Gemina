  A 6-minute walk work ( 6MWW) , that is the product of distance walked at the 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT) multiplied by body<symptom> weight , has been suggested as an appropriate variable for estimating functional capacity. Under the hypothesis that 6MWW strongly correlates with expiratory muscle strength ( P A cross-sectional study was carried out at the Regional Referral Centre for Cystic<disease> Fibrosis<disease> , where patients with cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> attending their regular follow-up , aged 18 years or older with mild-to-normal lung disease , were asked to participate. Dietitians determined nutritional status before subjects performed spirometry and static measurement of respiratory muscles. The 6MWT was performed as the last study procedure. Spearman correlation test was used to correlate P Twenty-five cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> subjects aged 18-30 years and with FEV Increased functional exercise tolerance is related to higher static expiratory pressure in patients with mild-to-normal cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> lung disease. Difference in exercise performance might reflect a possible difference in body composition that needs to be further investigated.
