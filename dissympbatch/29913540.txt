  Surgical principles for treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee include bone<disease> marrow stimulation techniques ( i.e. arthroscopic microfracturing) and transplantation techniques ( i.e. autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral transplantation). On the basis of increasing scientific evidence , indications for these established therapeutical concepts have been specified and clear recommendations for practical use have been given. Within recent years , matrix-augmented bone<disease> marrow stimulation has been established as a new treatment concept for chondral lesions<symptom>. To date , scientific evidence is limited and specific indications are still unclear. The present paper gives an overview of available products as well as preclinical and clinical scientific evidence. On the basis of the present evidence and an expert consensus from the `` Working Group on Tissue Regeneration '' of the German Orthopaedic and Trauma Society ( DGOU) , indications are specified and recommendations for the use of matrix-augmented bone<disease> marrow stimulation are given. In principle , it can be stated that the various products offered in this field differ considerably in terms of the number and quality of related studies ( evidence level). Against the background of the current data situation , their application is currently seen in the border area between cell transplantation and bone<disease> marrow stimulation techniques , but also as an improvement on traditional bone<disease> marrow stimulation within the indication range of microfracturing. The recommendations of the Working Group have preliminary character and require re-evaluation after improvement of the study situation.
