  Protein overload of proximal tubular cells ( PTCs) can promote interstitial injury by unclear mechanisms that may involve activation of innate immunity. We investigated whether prolonged exposure of tubular cells to high protein concentrations stimulates innate immunity , triggering progressive interstitial inflammation<symptom> and renal injury , and whether specific inhibition of innate or adaptive immunity would provide renoprotection in an established model of massive proteinuria<symptom> , adriamycin nephropathy ( ADR). Adult male Munich-Wistar rats received a single dose of ADR ( 5 mg/kg , iv) , being followed for 2 , 4 , or 20 weeks. Massive albuminuria was associated with early activation of both the NF-κB and NLRP3 innate immunity pathways , whose intensity correlated strongly with the density of lymphocyte<symptom> infiltration. In addition , ADR rats exhibited clear signs of renal oxidative stress. Twenty weeks after ADR administration , marked interstitial fibrosis<disease> , glomerulosclerosis , and renal functional loss were observed. Administration of mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF) , 10 mg/kg/day , prevented activation of both innate and adaptive immunity , as well as renal oxidative stress and renal fibrosis<disease>. Moreover , MMF treatment was associated with shifting of M from the M1 to the M2 phenotype. In cultivated NRK52-E cells , excess albumin increased the protein content of Toll-like receptor ( TLR) 4 ( TLR4) , NLRP3 , MCP-1 , IL6 , IL-1β , Caspase-1 , α-actin , and collagen-1. Silencing of
