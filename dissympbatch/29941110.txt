  The aim of the present study was to compare the immunoexpression of CD34 , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1) , and podoplanin and the presence of mast cells with clinical , demographic , radiologic , and histologic features from periapical granulomas<disease> , periapical cysts<symptom> , and residual cysts<symptom>. Thirty-one lesions<symptom> ( 5 granulomas<disease> , 15 periapical cysts<symptom> , and 11 residual cysts<symptom>) were selected. Histologic sections in silanized slides were used for the immunohistochemical reactions. The analysis of the images was performed by using an optical microscope , and data were analyzed with 5 % significance ( P < .05). Cysts<symptom> presented atrophic and hyperplastic epithelium in 11 cases ( 35.5 %) and 15 cases ( 48.8 %) , respectively ( P > .05). The intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate was similar when comparing the 3 groups ( P > .05). CD34 and podoplanin expression and the presence of mast cells were similar when comparing the 3 groups; ICAM-1 expression was more intense in granulomas<disease> than cysts<symptom> ( P < .05). There were no statistically significant differences associated with the expression of the evaluated markers according to the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate. There were no differences in the expression of CD34 and podoplanin and in the presence of mast cells when the 3 groups were compared. ICAM-1 expression was more common in periapical
