  Metabolic syndrome<disease> has been associated with psoriasis in cross-sectional studies , but data from prospective studies are sparse. To prospectively examine whether metabolic syndrome<disease> and its components are associated with risk of incident psoriasis in a large population-based study using objective measurements of cardiovascular disease risk factors. We used data from two consecutive surveys of the HUNT Study , Norway ( HUNT2 , 1995-1997 , and HUNT3 , 2006-08). A total of 34 996 women and men aged â‰¥ 20 years without psoriasis in HUNT2 were followed up in HUNT3 , and 374 incident psoriasis cases were identified. We used Cox regression to estimate adjusted relative risk ( RR) of incident psoriasis with 95 % confidence interval ( CI). Metabolic syndrome<disease> was associated with an RR for psoriasis of 1.66 ( 95 % CI 1.30 , 2.14). To explore the influence of adiposity on this association , we first excluded waist circumference from the definition of metabolic syndrome<disease> ( adjusted RR = 1.54; 95 % CI 1.14 , 2.07) and then adjusted for body mass index ( RR = 1.33; 95 % CI 0.97 , 1.81). Analyses of the separate components of metabolic syndrome<disease> showed positive associations with risk of psoriasis for waist circumference , triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein ( HDL) cholesterol , but not for blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and blood glucose. There was also an increased risk of psoriasis for high total cholesterol. The increased risk associated with high triglycerides , HDL cholesterol and total cholesterol was attenuated after adjusting for body mass index. In this large prospective study from a general population , we found that metabolic syndrome<disease> was associated with increased risk of incident psoriasis , and our results suggest that this positive association could , at least partly , be attributed to adiposity.
