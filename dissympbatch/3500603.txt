  Hepatic sclerosing hemangioma , a very rare benign tumor , is characterized by fibrosis<disease> and hyalinization occurring in association with degeneration of a hepatic cavernous hemangioma. Such atypical hemangiomas can be diagnosed incorrectly as primary or metastatic malignancies based on imaging characteristics. We present herein a rare case of giant and multiple hepatic sclerosing hemangiomas that are difficult to differentiate from hepatic malignancies and review the relevant literature. The patient was a 48-year-old male who was found to have multiple hepatic tumors and a giant tumor ( 67 Ã— 53 mm) superior to the inferior vena cave by an abdominal ultrasonography during a routine medical examination. The patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluations and diagnosis of the multiple hepatic tumors. Dynamic CT showed low-density tumors in the delayed phase suggestive of membrane-covered lesions<symptom>. EOB-MRI demonstrated a mass with low-signal intensity mass on T1-weighted images and areas of high-signal intensity on T2-weighted images and a hypointense mass in the hepatobiliary phase , which showed high intensity on DWI-based ADC map. FDG-PET showed no accumulation of ( Differentiation of multiple sclerosing hemangiomas from other hepatic malignant tumors , such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma , metastatic liver cancer , and scirrhous hepatocellular carcinoma characterized by abundant fibrous stroma , is difficult because the radiological findings are very similar. Inclusion of hepatic sclerosing hemangioma in the differential diagnosis of multiple liver tumors could enable optimal management; this possibility is important to consider before planning invasive therapies.
