  Thoracic outlet syndrome<disease> ( TOS) describes a group of disorders that are due to a dynamic compression of blood vessels or nerves , between the clavicle and first rib or cervical vertebral nerve roots. Individuals with TOS typically experience upper limb<symptom> pain<symptom> , numbness , tingling , or weakness<symptom> that is exacerbated by shoulder or neck<symptom> movement<symptom>. The causes of TOS vary , and can include abrupt movements , hypertrophy of the neck musculature , and anatomical variations in which the brachial plexus roots pass through this musculature , edema<symptom> , pregnancy , repeated overhead motions , the blockage of an artery or vein , or abnormal<symptom> posture<symptom> To understand the complexity of this condition , an analysis of shoulder anatomy and mechanics are needed to help describe limitations and the subsequent pathophysiology of TOS. Several treatment options are available , including surgery , medications , and exercise. A comprehensive study of shoulder anatomy and biomechanics , and knowledge of the benefits of exercise , may help clinicians and healthcare practitioners determine the most appropriate treatment plan for an individual with TOS.
