  Golimumab ( GOL) is registered for moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC). Data on the use of GOL in daily clinical practice are limited. Currently , it is unclear which factors are predictive of a favorable outcome. The goals of this study were to evaluate the mid-term outcome of GOL ( week 26) in patients with moderate to severe UC and to determine predictors of favorable outcome. Patients included in the SMART study ( NCT02155335) were evaluated for their mid-term outcome. Demographic data , disease characteristics , and medical history were recorded retrospectively. Data on disease activity based on total Mayo score , previous and concomitant medication , GOL dosing , mucosal healing ( Mayo 0 or 1) , adverse events ( colectomy , hospitalization) , and biomarkers ( C-reactive protein , fecal calprotectin , hemoglobin , and albumin) were collected at baseline and weeks 2 , 6 , 14 , 26 , and 52. GOL was dosed at 200 and 100 mg at weeks 0 and 2 , respectively , and 50 mg ( < 80 kg body<symptom> weight) or 100 mg ( ≥ 80 kg body<symptom> weight) every 4 weeks thereafter. The primary end point was steroid-free GOL continuation at week 26. From the 91 evaluable patients ( 42 % female; median age , 42 years; median disease duration , 5 years) , 4 % were active smokers , 25 % had extensive colitis<disease> , and 38 % had an endoscopic Mayo score of 3 at baseline. The median ( interquartile range ( IQR)) baseline Mayo score was 9 ( 8-10). Although 75 % of patients had previously failed immunomodulators ( IMMs) , the majority ( 87 %) were anti-tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF) naïve. GOL was started in combination with IMM in 40 % and steroids in 64 %. The median ( IQR) duration of GOL therapy during follow-up was 35.7 ( 11.4-105.7) weeks. Twenty-six weeks after GOL induction , 37 patients ( 41 %) were steroid-free and still on GOL , of whom 8 ( 21.6 %) required GOL dose optimization. Short-term mucosal healing ( STMH) at week 14 was evaluated in 60 % of the patients. Considering the whole cohort , only 40 % achieved STMH. No predictors could be retained of short-term treatment outcome. In multivariate analysis , STMH was predictive of steroid-free GOL continuation at week 26 ( odds ratio ( OR) , 5.56; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.90-16.29; P = 0.002) and week 52 ( OR , 9.38; 95 % CI , 2.68-32.84; P < 0.001). In patients continuing GOL after week 14 , STMH was predictive of intervention-free survival ( OR , 2.05; 95 % CI , 1.09-3.86; P = 0.026) and discontinuation-free survival ( OR , 3.47; 95 % CI , 1.58-7.58; P = 0.002). During follow-up , 78 % needed an intervention , 68 % discontinued GOL , and 3 patients needed a colectomy. Real-life data confirm the moderate effectiveness of GOL on the mid-term in active UC , but therapeutic interventions are frequently needed. Short-term mucosal healing predicts a favorable outcome. 10.1093/ ibd/izy219 _ video1izy219.video15798038438001.
