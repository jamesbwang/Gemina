  Although decompressive fasciotomy is a limb-saving procedure in the setting of acute compartment syndrome<disease> , it leaves a large wound<disease> defect with tissue edema<symptom> and skin retraction that can preclude primary closure. Numerous techniques have been described to address the challenge of closing fasciotomy wounds<disease> This study reports our experience with fasciotomy closure using rubber bands ( RBs) for external tissue expansion. Patients were informed about RB closure and split-thickness skin graft options. Only patients who opted for RB closure and had wounds<disease> that could not be approximated using the pinch test underwent the procedure. Starting from the apex and progressively advancing , the RBs were applied to the skin edges at 3 to 4 mm intervals using staples. The RBs were advanced by twisting back-and-forth to create a criss-cross pattern. One week after application , fasciotomy wounds<disease> were closed primarily or underwent further RB application , based on clinical assessment of adequacy of skin advancement , compartment tension , and perfusion. Review of a prospectively maintained database was performed , including demographics , comorbidities , etiology , wound<disease> and operative details , hospital stay , and complications. Seventeen consecutive patients with 25 wounds<disease> ( 22 fasciotomy and 3 other surgical wounds<disease> were treated using the RB technique. Average wound<disease> length and width measured 15.7 cm ( range , 5-32 cm) and 5.2 cm ( range , 1-12 cm) , respectively. Locations of wounds<disease> included forearm ( n = 12 , 48.0 %) , leg ( n = 7 , 28.0 %) , hand ( n = 4 , 16.0 %) , elbow ( n = 1 , 4.0 %) , and hip ( n = 1 , 4.0 %). Eighteen of 25 wounds<disease> ( 72.0 %) were closed primarily after 1 RB application. Additional RB application was required for 5 wounds<disease> to achieve primary closure. Between stages , patients were discharged home if they did not have other conditions requiring in-hospital stay. No complications were observed , and no revision surgeries were required. Patient satisfaction was 100 % , and all indicated that they would choose the RB technique over skin grafting. The modified RB technique is a simple , safe , and cost-effective alternative for treating fasciotomy and other surgical defects resulting in high patient satisfaction and good cosmetic outcome , without the need for split-thickness skin graft or flap coverage.
