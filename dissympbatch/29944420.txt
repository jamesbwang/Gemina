  Cotard 's Syndrome<disease> ( CS) , among the noncognitive changes in the forms of dementia , is a seldom-found manifestation ( 1). This syndrome<disease> is characterized by the delusion of having lost organs ( the individual experiences huge changes in the body and believes that he/she no longer has one or more organs) and by nihilistic delusion ( the individual believes he/she or everyone in the world has died or been destroyed) ( 2). In 1880 , Jules Cotard ( 1840-1889) described a clinical condition that he believed corresponded to a new subtype of depression<symptom> , which he called anxious melancholia. He proposed that a state of acute<symptom> depression<symptom> and morbid anxiety<symptom> could foster the development of structured delusions of hypochondria. Two years later he referred to the same clinical condition using the term délires des négations for the first time ( 3). The eponym CS was only introduced in 1893 by Emil Regis , who stated that Cotard had not described a new clinical entity but rather a syndrome<disease>- a cluster of symptoms that could also be found in other mental illnesses apart from depression<symptom> and in which anxiety<symptom> was the central characteristic ( 4). The most prominent symptoms found in an analysis of one hundred cases were: depressed mood ( 89 %) , nihilistic delusion ( 69 %) , anxiety<symptom> ( 65 %) , delusion of guilt ( 63 %) , delusion of immortality ( 55 %) and hypochondriacal delusions ( 58 %) ( 12). Currently , CS is not classified as an isolated disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5) of the American Psychiatric Association or in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ( ICD-10). There is a growing consensus to consider it a secondary syndrome<disease> of an underlying disorder , of which the most associated disorders are: unipolar depression<symptom> , bipolar depression<symptom> and primary psychotic disorders. Other conditions have also been described , such as dementia , severe intellectual disability , cerebrovascular accident , brain tumor , and Parkinson 's disease , among others ( 5).
