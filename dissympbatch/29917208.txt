  Type 1 cardiorenal syndrome<disease> ( CRS) is an acute<symptom> renal<symptom> failure<symptom> in patients with acute decompensated heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with an incidence of 24 % to 45 %. The aim of our study was to investigate the significance of new renal biomarkers to predict type 1 CRS. The study included 111 patients with acute decompensated heart<symptom> failure<symptom> diagnosed at the Istanbul Medical Faculty Emergency Department between 2014 and 2016 , and 24 healthy volunteers. All urine samples were stored at -80 °C after centrifugation. Samples were run according to the instructions of TIMP-2 , ILGF-7 , KIM-1 , and IGFBP-7 ELISA kits. Diuretic treatments were then administered with intravenous administration of at least 80 mg furosemide per day. Follow-up biochemical and spot urine specimens were taken after 72 hours. For statistical analysis , SPSS version 21.0 statistical software was used. Significance was evaluated at p < 0.05. The baseline creatinine level was measured as 1.33 ± 0.39 mg/dL in the heart<symptom> failure<symptom> group. It was seen that 67 % ( 75) of the patients had increased creatinine levels and developed type 1 CRS. ILGF-7 , TIMP-2 , and ( ILGF-7 * TIMP-2) values were significantly higher in patients with cardiorenal syndrome<disease> when we separated the two groups as patients with and without cardiorenal syndrome<disease> ( 0.40 ( 0.25-0.71) , p1: 0.049/ 2.40 ( 1.42-3.70) , p2: 0.003/ 1.15 ( 0.29-2.43) , p3: 0.001). Renal tubular markers reveal promising developments in the pathophysiology of cardiorenal syndrome<disease> in light of recently obtained data. Renal tubular biomarkers may have the potential to be a predictor of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and cardiorenal
