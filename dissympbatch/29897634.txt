  Spitzoid neoplasms pose diagnostic difficulties because their morphology is not consistently predictive of their biologic potential. Recent advances in the molecular characterization of these tumours provide a framework by which they can now begin to be categorized. In particular , spitzoid lesions<symptom> with ALK rearrangement have been specifically associated with a characteristic plexiform growth pattern of intersecting fascicles of amelanotic spindled melanocytes. We report a case of an 87-year-old man with a 3-cm nodule<disease> on his mid-upper back comprised of an intradermal proliferation of fusiform amelanotic melanocytes arranged in intersecting fascicles with occasional peritumoural clefts. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated diffuse , strong expression of SOX10 and S100 by the tumour cells and diffuse , weak to moderate cytoplasmic positivity for ALK , suggestive of ALK rearrangement. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed no ALK rearrangements but instead revealed â‰¥ 3 intact ALK signals in 36 % of the tumour cells , confirming ALK copy number gain. To our knowledge , this is the first reported case of a plexiform spitzoid neoplasm exhibiting ALK copy number gain instead of ALK rearrangement. This case suggests that ALK copy number gain is a novel mechanism of ALK activation but with the same characteristic histopathologic growth pattern seen among ALK-rearranged spitzoid neoplasms.
