  Adverse effects of linezolid are typically limited to diarrhea<disease> , nausea<symptom> , and headache<symptom> when shorter durations are used; however , as extended durations of linezolid therapy are increasingly more common , additional monitoring parameters should be considered in these patients. We describe a unique case of hypoglycemia , lactic acidosis , and pancreatitis<disease> related to an extended duration of linezolid therapy. A 52-year-old woman presented with altered<symptom> mental<symptom> status<symptom> , abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , and hypotension<symptom> following six weeks of linezolid and ertapenem therapy. Laboratory data revealed an initial blood glucose of 40 mg/dL and metabolic acidosis secondary to lactic acidosis. Finally , her abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> on admission was likely related to an enlarged pancreas noted on computed tomography of her abdomen. Due to suspected linezolid toxicity , the patient received two intermittent hemodialysis sessions to remove linezolid and correct the metabolic acidosis. Given limited data on long-term monitoring of patients receiving extended durations of linezolid therapy , we suggest periodic monitoring of lactate , arterial blood gas , and blood glucose. If patients present with this triad of symptoms secondary to linezolid therapy , adverse effects should be treated with dextrose and intravenous thiamine while reserving hemodialysis for those with metabolic acidosis refractory to thiamine.
