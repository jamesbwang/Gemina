  Primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG) is a complex<disease> disease<disease> and a leading cause of irreversible blindness<symptom> , and its underlying pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Proteomic characterization of the protein composition of aqueous humor ( AH) may identify prognostic candidate proteins involved in pathogenesis and progression of the disease. To delineate the possible mechanisms that lead to POAG , this study adopted state-of-art mass spectrometric technique and analyzed AH of POAG and their respective controls. In total , more than 1000 proteins were identified with false discovery rate of less than 1 %. Numerous proteins of complement cascade , immunoglobulin , neuronal and amyloidogenic proteins , which were part of processes like acute-phase and inflammatory response , humoral immune and acute inflammatory response , regulation of complement activation and protein processing were identified. Proteins of complement system underwent significant changes , which correlate to pathogenic events characterizing POAG , including altered complement cascade , astrocyte activation , neural degeneration , and apoptosis. Further , protein modification such as deamidation of complement subcomponent was noted , particularly in POAG. Proteomic analysis of AH allows a better understanding of the mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of POAG.
