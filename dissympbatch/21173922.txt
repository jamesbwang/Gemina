  Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia<disease> ( IPEH) is an uncommon benign vascular disease characterized by endothelial cell proliferation and papillary formation within the lumen of blood vessels arising from an organizing thrombus. The occurrence of this uncommon lesion<symptom> is about 2 % of all vascular tumors. IPEH mostly occurs in the 5th decade of life , and there is no gender or age predilection. Nevertheless , some studies have suggested that IPEH is more common in women than in men. The clinical features are mostly asymptomatic , and the lesion<symptom> is typically characterized as a small , firm , slightly elevated mass with red to blue discoloration of the overlying skin. The main diagnosis of the lesion<symptom> is based on histological examination. The most common locations of IPEH are head and neck , fingers , and trunk. The occurrence of IPEH in the urethra is extremely rare , with only a few cases having been reported in the literature. We describe a 70-year-old woman with a complaint of dysuria and urethral bleeding of 3 days ' duration. Clinically , the lesion<symptom> was a palpable firm mass in the urethra. Urethrocystoscopy illustrated a dark mass , a few millimeters in size , with bleeding. Histologic findings revealed dilated blood vessels with multiple papillary projections into the lumen. Thus , based on these findings , a final diagnosis of Masson 's tumor was confirmed. According to clinical and radiographic findings , this lesion<symptom> is similar to malignant lesions<symptom> and its accurate diagnosis is based on microscopic findings. Therefore , awareness of the microscopic characteristics of this tumor is very important for clinicians to rule out the presence of malignant vascular lesions<symptom> and to avoid unnecessarily aggressive therapy.
