  High-dose penicillin therapy is effective in approximately 90 % of pneumococcal pneumonia<disease> cases diagnosed based on urinary pneumococcal antigen tests or Gram staining at admission. The efficacy of high-dose penicillin therapy for pneumococcal pneumonia<disease> diagnosed based on an initial comprehensive assessment comprising a syndromic approach , Gram staining of sputum<symptom> and urinary pneumococcal antigen testing was investigated. Seventy adult patients diagnosed with pneumococcal pneumonia<disease> based on an initial comprehensive assessment and treated with high-dose penicillin G at admission were included. The median patient age was 76.5 years , and 37.1 % of the patients were women. The urinary pneumococcal antigen test was positive in 67.1 % of all patients , and Gram staining of sputum<symptom> showed that gram-positive cocci were dominant in 58.6 % of the patients. The primary outcome was treatment success based on vital signs until day 6. Treatment with high-dose penicillin G was effective in 87.1 % of the patients ( 95 % CI 79.1-95.2 %) , and the proportion of patients who received other antibiotics because of treatment failure with penicillin G was only 5.7 %. The efficacy of high-dose penicillin G treatment for pneumococcal pneumonia<disease> diagnosed based on a comprehensive assessment at admission may be comparable to that in previous reports.
