  Wilson 's disease ( WD) is an inherited disorder in which defective biliary excretion of copper leads to its accumulation , particularly in the liver and brain. Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) is a multi-system disorder that can manifest in any system. Cases with concomitant WD and SLE , unrelated to treatment with penicillamine , have been rarely reported. We report a case of a young woman who had typical neuropsychiatric symptoms and laboratory tests results of WD. She also had concomitant massive hematuria<symptom> and proteinuria<symptom> , fever<disease> , multiple positive autoimmune antibodies , hypocomplementemia , abnormal lumbar puncture findings and evidence of Sj√∂gren syndrome<disease> , which are all rare in WD. Hence , we considered the diagnosis of SLE. Tapering of steroid dosage also confirmed the diagnosis. Wilson 's disease and SLE have varied clinical manifestations. Herein , we reported a rare case in which the two conditions concomitantly existed. In clinical practice , differential diagnosis of the two diseases is necessary for patients with hepatic , neurological , and psychiatric manifestations.
