  The rare syndrome<disease> of perioral myoclonia with absences ( POMA) is described as a specific type of idiopathic generalized epilepsy in which absence seizures<symptom> are accompanied by prominent perioral myoclonus as a consistent symptom. We present a 52-year-old man who was referred to our department due to treatment-resistant epilepsy. Typical seizures<symptom> were described as rhythmic twitching<symptom> of the lips which started at six years old , and his first convulsive seizure<symptom> occurred at around 20 years old. Based on video-EEG recordings , we present two distinct EEG patterns accompanied by slight differences in clinical manifestations , which appear to be atypical of POMA. Firstly , consciousness<symptom> was preserved during seizures<symptom> , with no manifestation of absences. Secondly , regarding the EEG features , in some of the seizures<symptom> , the perioral motor<symptom> symptoms<symptom> were tonic rather than myoclonic. The defining features of POMA are discussed in relation to this case.
