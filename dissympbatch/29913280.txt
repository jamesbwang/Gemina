  Caspase-mediated apoptosis and inflammation<symptom> contribute to progression of liver disease. Emricasan is a pan-caspase inhibitor that reduced serum markers of apoptosis and liver inflammation<symptom> in patients with hepatitis<disease> C<disease> and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH). We performed a multicenter study of 86 patients with cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh class A or B; mean score , 6.9; 38 % with alcohol-associated cirrhosis , 29 % with HCV-associated cirrhosis , and 23 % with NASH) and model for end-stage liver disease ( MELD) scores of 11-18 ( mean , 12.8). Patients were randomly assigned to groups given placebo ( n = 42) or emricasan ( 25 mg , n = 44) , twice daily for 3 months; subjects then received open-label emricasan ( 25 mg) twice-daily for 3 months. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in serum levels of cleaved keratin 18 ( CK-18) at month 3. Seventy-four patients completed the 3-month study period ( 40 given emricasan and 34 given placebo); 69 patients received open-label emricasan for 3 months afterward. At the 3-month timepoint , emricasan significantly reduced mean MELD ( P = .003) and Child-Pugh ( P = .003) scores in subjects with high MELD scores ( 15 or more) , compared with placebo , with significant reductions in INR ( 95 % CI , -0.2882 to -0.0866) and total bilirubin ( 95 % CI , -1.5069 to -0.0823) vs placebo. There were no significant differences between emricasan and placebo groups in mean MELD ( P = .466) or Child-Pugh ( P = .124) scores overall at 3 months compared to placebo. Of patients with high MELD scores , 6/9 given emricasan ( 67 %) had a reduction of 2 points or more at month 3 , compared with 2/10 given placebo ( 20 %). Serum levels of full-length CK-18 ( P = .02) and caspase 3/7 ( P < .001) , but not cleaved CK-18 ( P = .092) , decreased significantly at 3 months in the emricasan vs placebo group. Emricasan was well tolerated , and adverse events were balanced between groups. Emricasan 's effects were generally maintained or increased after 6 months of treatment. In a randomized trial of patients with cirrhosis , we found 3 months treatment with emricasan to improve liver function , compared with placebo , reducing MELD and Child-Pugh scores , INR , and total bilirubin in patients with MELD scores â‰¥ 15.
