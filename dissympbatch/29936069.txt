  In healthy lungs , epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC) is regulated by short , palate , lung , and nasal clone 1 ( SPLUNC1). In cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) , ENaC is hyperactivated in part due to a loss of SPLUNC1 function. We have developed SPX-101 to replace the lost function of SPLUNC1 in the CF lung. Expression of SPLUNC1 was determined in sputum<symptom> from healthy and CF donors. Stability of SPLUNC1 , S18 ( the ENaC regulatory domain of SPLUNC1) , and SPX-101 was determined in sputum<symptom> from CF donors and towards neutrophil elastase. Activity of SPX-101 after exposure to CF sputum<symptom> was determined in airway epithelial cells from CF donors and in the βENaC transgenic mouse model. SPLUNC1 protein expression is significantly reduced in CF as compared to healthy sputum<symptom>. SPLUNC1 is rapidly degraded in CF sputum<symptom> as well as by a number of individual proteases known to be found in the sputum<symptom>. SPX-101 , but not S18 , is stable in CF sputum<symptom>. Finally , SPX-101 retains its ability to internalize ENaC , regulate airway surface liquid height , and increase survival of βENaC mice after exposure to CF sputum<symptom>. Our results demonstrate that SPX-101 , but not SPLUNC1 or S18 , is stable in CF sputum<symptom>. These results support the therapeutic development of SPX-101 for the treatment of
