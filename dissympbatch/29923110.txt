  This pilot pre-and post-intervention study investigated the effects of a short-term aquatic exercise programme on physiological outcomes , symptoms and exercise capacity in women with chronic<symptom> fatigue<symptom> syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis<disease> ( CFS/ME). Eleven women ( 54.8 Â± 12.4 year) volunteered for the 5-week program; an initial 20-min aquatic exercise session then two self-paced 20-min sessions per week for 4 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention outcomes were physiological measures , 6 min Walk Test ( 6MWT) , perceived exertion ( RPE) , hand grip strength , Sit-to-Stand , Sit-Reach test , Apley 's shoulder test , FACIT questionnaire , and 24-h post-test tiredness and pain scores ( 0-10 visual analogue scale). Heart rates , RPE , 24- and 48-h post-session tiredness/pain scores were recorded each session. 6MWT distance increased by 60.8 m ( p = 0.006) , left hand grip strength by 6 kg ( p = 0.038) , Sit-Reach test by 4.0 cm ( p = 0.017) , right shoulder flexibility by 2.9 cm ( p = 0.026) , FACIT scores by 8.2 ( p = 0.041); 24-h post-test tiredness and pain decreased by 1.5 and 1.6 , respectively ( p = 0.002). There were significant post-intervention increases in exercising heart rates ( 6MWT 4- and 6-min time points) , oxygen saturation at 2-min , and reduced RPE at 4-min. Weekly resting and exercising heart rates increased significantly during the study but RPE decreased; immediately post- and 24-h post-session tiredness decreased significantly. There were no reports of symptom exacerbation. Five weeks of low-moderate intensity aquatic exercise significantly improved exercise capacity , RPE and fatigue<symptom>. This exercise mode exercise may potentially be a manageable and safe physical activity for CFS/ME patients.
