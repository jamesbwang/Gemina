  To investigate 1‑year outcomes with routine prasugrel treatment after acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) in a large-scale registry. The Rijnmond Collective Cardiology Research registry is a prospective , observational study that enrolled 4,258 consecutive ACS patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) with 1‑year follow-up. Patients received prasugrel as first-choice antiplatelet agent , except for increased bleeding risk patients in which clopidogrel was recommended. Events were validated by an independent clinical endpoint committee. A total number of 2,677 patients received prasugrel at discharge after the index event. Eighty-one percent of the target population was on prasugrel treatment at hospital discharge. At 1 year , the primary endpoint , a composite of all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction , occurred in 2.4 % of patients receiving prasugrel. All-cause mortality occurred in 1.0 % , myocardial infarction in 1.5 % , target-vessel revascularisation in 3.1 % , stent thrombosis in 0.6 % , and stroke in 0.5 % of the patients treated with prasugrel. Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction defined major bleeding episodes not related to coronary artery bypass grafting were observed in 1.4 % of patients receiving prasugrel. In routine practice , a tailored approach of prasugrel prescription in ACS patients undergoing PCI , resulted in low ischaemic and low<symptom> bleeding<symptom> rates up to 1 year post PCI.
