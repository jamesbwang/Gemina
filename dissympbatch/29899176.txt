  This study compared agar gel immunodiffusion ( AGID) protocols for diagnosing equine infectious anemia<symptom> Two commercial testing kits were used: one following the Japanese Act on Domestic Animal Infectious<disease> Diseases<disease> Control and one following the World Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE) manual. From 651 samples tested , both protocols gave identical results for 647 samples ( 23 samples tested positive; 624 tested negative). Non-specific reactions were observed in 21 samples testing negative by the Japanese protocol , but none were observed with the OIE protocol. The kappa coefficient value was 0.962 , indicating almost perfect agreement between the two protocols. This study found no difference in diagnostic agreement between the two protocols , but the OIE protocol produced non-specific reactions less frequently than the Japanese protocol.
