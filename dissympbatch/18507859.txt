  Osteoarthritis ( OA) is the most common form of arthritis<disease> involving major structural changes of peripheral joints and local or systemic inflammation<symptom> and in lack of therapeutic approaches because of complexity of underlying molecular basis. Our previous work showed that HS6ST2 , an enzyme involved in the transfer of sulfate , is downregulated in cartilage tissues of OA patients compared with normal donors , but little is known about its regulatory mechanism. In this study , we demonstrated that the expression of HS6ST2 was lower in OA-damaged cartilage than smooth cartilage from the same patient. In chondrocytes , HS6ST2 could be targeted by miR-23b-3p , which was higher expressed in OA-damaged cartilage. Under TNF-Î± stimulation , the expression of HS6ST2 was found inversely correlated with the expression of miR-23b-3p. Downregulation of HS6ST2 regulated by overexpression of miR-23b-3p and siRNAs against HS6ST2 could enhance the protein level of MMP13 and aggravate the matrix degradation in chondrocytes. Increased expression of MMP13 depended on activity of p38 MAPK rather than total p38 MAPK level and was abrogated by HS6ST2 overexpression. Together , the results indicated that downregulated HS6ST2 targeted by miR-23b-3p promotes matrix degradation by activating p38 MAPK in chondrocytes and OA cartilage.
