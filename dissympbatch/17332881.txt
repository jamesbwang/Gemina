  Despite being a cardinal experimental model , the induction of cirrhosis in rats by repeated exposure to carbon tetrachloride ( CCl4) has low reproducibility. Here , we compared two models of cirrhosis induced by orogastric administration of CCl4 once ( CCl4-1xWk) or twice a week ( CCl4-2xWk) for 12 weeks in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Control rats received water instead of CCl4. Both CCl4 protocols similarly attenuated body<symptom> weight gain ( p < 0.01 vs. Control). Although both CCl4 protocols increased hepatic fibrosis<disease> , portal hypertension and splenomegaly<symptom> , the magnitude of these alterations was higher and more consistent in CCl4-2xWk rats. Importantly , two CCl4-1xWk rats did not develop cirrhosis versus a 100 % yield of cirrhosis in CCl4-2xWk rats. The CCl4-2xWk protocol consistently induced liver atrophy together with hematological , biochemical and coagulation abnormalities characteristic of advanced cirrhosis that were absent in CCl4-1xWk rats. Ascites occurred in 20 % and 80 % of rats in theCCl4-1xWk and CCl4-2xWk groups ( p < 0.01). All rats showed normal renal function , arterial blood gases and stable systemic hemodynamics. The total dose of CCl4 and mortality rate were similar in both protocols. The CCl4-2xWk protocol , therefore , was highly reproducible and effective for the induction of experimental cirrhosis within a confined time , representing a valuable advance for liver research.
