  Mechanical ventilation ( MV) is often used to maintain life in patients with sepsis<disease> and sepsis-related acute lung injury. However , controlled MV may cause diaphragm weakness<symptom> due to muscle injury and atrophy , an effect termed ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction ( VIDD). Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4) and nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB) signaling pathways may elicit sepsis-related acute inflammatory responses and muscle protein degradation and mediate the pathogenic mechanisms of VIDD. However , the mechanisms regulating the interactions between VIDD and endotoxemia are unclear. We hypothesized that mechanical stretch with or without endotoxin treatment would augment diaphragmatic structural damage , the production of free radicals , muscle proteolysis , mitochondrial dysfunction , and autophagy of the diaphragm via the TLR4/NF-κB pathway. Male C57BL/6 mice , either wild-type or TLR4-deficient , aged between 6 and 8 weeks were exposed to MV ( 6 mL/kg or 10 mL/kg) with or without endotoxemia for 8 h. Nonventilated mice were used as controls. MV with endotoxemia aggravated VIDD , as demonstrated by the increases in the expression levels of TLR4 , caspase-3 , atrogin-1 , muscle ring finger-1 , and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II. In addition , increased NF-κB phosphorylation and oxidative loads , disorganized myofibrils , disrupted mitochondria , autophagy , and myonuclear apoptosis were also observed. Furthermore , MV with endotoxemia reduced P62 levels and diaphragm muscle fiber size ( P < 0.05). Endotoxin-exacerbated VIDD was attenuated by pharmacologic inhibition with a NF-κB inhibitor or in TLR4-deficient mice ( P < 0.05). Our data indicate that endotoxin-augmented MV-induced diaphragmatic injury occurs through the activation of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway.
