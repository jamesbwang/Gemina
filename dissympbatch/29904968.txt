  Topical cantharidin is a commonly used treatment for molluscum<disease> contagiosum<disease> ( MC). However , studies validating its safety and efficacy are limited. We conducted a 6-week , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial with subsequent open-label extension to assess the safety and effectiveness of cantharidin in treating pediatric MC. Ninety-four participants with MC were randomized to receive cantharidin or placebo , with or without occlusion. The primary outcome was complete lesion<symptom> clearance. Secondary outcomes included post-treatment lesion<symptom> count , adverse events , and side effects. No significant differences between the study arms , including baseline lesion<symptom> count , were observed. The overall mean ( SD) baseline lesion<symptom> count was 22.2 ( 12.9). The number of participants achieving total clearance is as follows: 7/23 ( 30.4 %) in the cantharidin only arm , 10/24 ( 41.7 %) in the cantharidin with occlusion arm , 2/25 ( 8.0 %) in the placebo with occlusion arm , and 3/22 ( 13.6 %) in the placebo only arm. Post hoc analysis demonstrated that 17/47 ( 36.2 %) participants in the combined cantharidin arms achieved clearance compared to 5/47 ( 10.6 %) in the placebo arms ( P = 0.0065). The mean ( SD) lesion<symptom> count change from baseline was -5.1 ( 12.2) in the placebo only arm; the mean change ( SD) was -17.4 ( 12.8) in the cantharidin only arm ( P = 0.0033) and -15.9 ( 11.6) in the cantharidin with occlusion arm ( P = 0.0101). No serious adverse events or side effects were observed. Topical cantharidin was well-tolerated and associated with the resolution of MC.
