  Central pancreatectomy ( CP) has been used sparingly because the spectrum of indications is quite narrow. The author has modified the procedure of CP in such a way to avoid distal pancreatic segment drainage , in addition to reserving the patient euo-insulinemic. Between March 2010 and January 2015 , 41 cases have been recruited. Cases presented with blunt abdominal trauma showing central pancreatic transection with or without duodenal transection have been recruited. Technique of CP has been modified to enable sparing distal pancreatic drainage procedure. The study describes a case series where the modified technique in the field of pancreatic surgery is applied on trauma patients through both laparoscopic and open approaches according to patients ' hemodynamic stability. There was no pancreatic fistula<disease> , deficiency nor any of the major complications related to the traditional CP technique. None of the cases developed pancreatic necrosis<symptom> or fistula<disease> , steatorrhea or showed picture of diabetes mellitus. The new technique has used the available anatomic and functional pancreatic facts to revolute sparing the distal pancreatic drainage procedure.
