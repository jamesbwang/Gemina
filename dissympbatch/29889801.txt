  The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficiency and side effects of mifamurtide in childhood osteosarcoma ( OS). In total , 477 doses of 2 mg/m intravenous ( IV) mifamurtide , along with paracetamol as a premedication , were given to 15 patients with primary nonmetastatic OS after complete surgical resection and to 3 patients with progressive OS. The most common side effects encountered in the patients were chills<symptom> and fever<disease> ( 17/18). These reactions were observed in 4 patients during the administration of each dose , in a single patient during the last administration , and in the remaining 12 patients during the first or initial 2 administrations. Headache<symptom> , myalgia<symptom> , and arthralgia were observed in 2 patients during each infusion. Headache<symptom> was observed in 1 patient with additional hearing loss during the first 2 infusions. One patient had back pain occuring within the first infusion. Of the 15 patients with primary nonmetastatic OS and treated with the addition of mifamurtide to chemotherapy , 13 showed a complete remission , and 2 patients were still under treatment with a complete remission. Of 3 patients with progressive disease , 2 died while the disease progressed further in the third case over a 51-month period. The 3-year overall survival and event-free survival distributions were 87.5 % ( mean follow-up time , 46.12; 95 % confidence interval , 37.79-52.45 mo) and 75.6 % ( mean follow-up time , 31.30; 95 % confidence interval , 26.54-36.06 mo) , respectively. We consider that mifamurtide therapy is a safe and well-tolerated agent in childhood OS.
