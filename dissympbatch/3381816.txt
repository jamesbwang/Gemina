  Beh√ßet disease ( BD) is an inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent oral aphthous ulcers<disease> , genital ulcers<disease> , ocular lesions<symptom> , and skin<symptom> lesions<symptom>. Complication of amyloidosis in patients with BD is rare. Here , we report a case of BD with immunoglobulin light chain ( AL)- amyloidosis manifested as hematochezia. A 61-year-old man developed sudden hematochezia due to bleeding from multiple small colonic ulcers<disease>; AL-amyloid deposition was found on immunohistochemical examination of biopsy specimen of colonic ulcer<disease>. Systemic investigation revealed cardiac disfunction with cardiomegaly and progressive renal dysfunction , which indicated the presence of systemic AL-amyloidosis. Based on the findings of colonic ulcers<disease> with cardiac and renal<symptom> involvement<symptom> , a diagnosis of systemic AL-amyloidosis complicated by incomplete BD was established. He was treated with increased dose of oral prednisolone ( 20 mg/day) , colchicine and mesalazine , because he was reluctant to receive aggressive chemotherapy ( melphalan and dexamethasone) or autologous stem cell transplantation. Colonic ulcers<disease> completely diminished after treatment , however , he died because of severe urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> and progressive renal<symptom> failure<symptom> after one year of gastrointestinal ( GI) manifestations. Our case shows that patients with BD may have GI manifestations due not only to entero-BD but also due to GI amyloidosis.
