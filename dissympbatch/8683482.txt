  The cavernous sinus ( CS) is a paired venous sinus that runs along either side of the pituitary gland on the floor of the calvarium. Cavernous sinus syndrome<disease> ( CSS) refers to deficits in more than one of the cranial nerves III , IV , V , and VI , as they are in close association in this region. The purpose of this study was to identify the presenting complaints , neurologic findings , diagnosis , and outcomes in dogs and cats with confirmed cavernous sinus syndrome<disease> ( CSS). Medical records between 2002 and 2015 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were neurologic signs consistent with CSS and advanced imaging and/or post-mortem examination. Thirteen dogs and 2 cats were included. Twelve dogs received advanced imaging. Post-mortem examination was performed on 2 cats and 3 dogs. Dogs were 6 -13 years ( mean = 10.8 years) of age and comprised of several different breeds. Both cats were male neutered domestic shorthair , ages 3 and 14 years. Presenting complaints included mydriasis<symptom> ( N = 4) , behavior changes ( N = 3) , hyporexia ( N = 3) , ptosis<symptom> ( N = 2) , ataxia<symptom> ( N = 2) , pain ( N = 2) , weakness<symptom> ( N = 2) , lethargy<symptom> ( N = 2) , and one each of epiphora , ocular swelling , polydipsia , seizures<symptom> , facial muscle atrophy , dysphagia<symptom> , and head tilt. Neurologic signs included ophthalmoparesis/plegia ( N = 13) , reduced/absent pupillary light response ( N = 11) , mydriasis<symptom> ( N = 10) , reduced/absent corneal<symptom> sensation<symptom> ( N = 7) , ptosis<symptom> ( N = 6) , reduced facial<symptom> sensation<symptom> ( N = 2) , and enophthalmos ( N = 1). Thirteen patients had a mass lesion<symptom> within the cavernous sinus , 6 of which were confirmed neoplastic via histopathology. Median survival time for the 4 patients treated with radiation therapy was 1035 days ( range 150-2280). Median survival for the 4 patients that received medical treatment was 360 days ( range 7-1260 days) , and for the 5 non-treated patients 14 days ( range 0-90 days). In conclusion mydriasis<symptom> and ophthalmoplegia<symptom> are common signs of CSS. A mass lesion<symptom> within the CS is the most common cause. Survival time may be improved with radiation therapy.
