  Sepsis<disease> with severe systemic inflammation<symptom> remains a great challenge for the intensive care unit in clinics. Although biomarkers have been identified to diagnose , monitor and predict these syndromes<disease> , novel therapeutic approaches are required for the amelioration of symptoms of sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom>. The present study demonstrated that interleukin ( IL) -31 was able reduce the mortality rate of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced sepsis<disease> with the reduction of inflammatory cytokines in the sera. IL-31 also inhibited IL-1Î² production in the peritoneal lavage fluid in LPS-induced or cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis<disease>. The
