  Early pregnancy failure is a common complication in pregnancies. It can be managed medically as well as surgically. Lately there has been an emphasis on medical management of early pregnancy failure. Misoprostol , a Prostaglandin E1 analogue has been found to be safe and effective in treatment of early pregnancy failure. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study that was conducted at the department of gynaecology and obstetrics , Ayub teaching hospital Abbottabad from Jan 2015 to Dec 2016. A total of 81 pregnant women with early pregnancy failure were enrolled in the study. Misoprostol was administered in a dose of 800 Î¼g PO and repeated every 3 hours for a maximum of three doses if and when required. Misoprostol was effective in 60 ( 74.07 %) patients and it resulted in complete expulsion of products of conception. The remainder needed surgical evacuation. There was a low incidence of side effects with nausea<symptom> being the most common ( 4.94 %) followed by PV bleeding ( 3.70 %) , abdominal<disease> cramps<disease> ( 3.70 %) and diarrhoea<disease> ( 2.47 %). Misoprostol is a safe and effective treatment option for the management of early pregnancy failure.
