  Diverticular disease of sigmoid colon can rarely be complicated by a connective track to urinary bladder. Pneumaturia and fecaluria are the pathognomonic symptoms. Resection surgery is the preferred treatment to overcome the renal sequellae of the disease. The purpose of this study is to propose a guiding classification to help general surgeons during surgical management of diverticular disease complicated by sigmoidovesical fistula<disease> ( SVF). The data of 40 cases with colovesical fistula<disease> due to diverticular disease of sigmoid colon were retrospectively analyzed. Clinicopathological variables , imaging reports , types of treatment and patient outcome were evaluated. There were 36 men ( 90 %) and four women ( 10 %) in which the ages ranged from 32 to 79 with a mean of 58.1 years. Pneumaturia was the most common presenting symptom in 38 cases ( 95 %) followed by urinary<symptom> symptoms<symptom> in 35 cases ( 87.5 %) then fecaluria in 33 cases ( 82.5 %). 37 patients underwent surgical resection while three patients were in poor general condition to withstand major resection. 16 patients underwent one stage resection and anastomosis , 16 patients were managed by two stage procedure and the remaining 5 patients were treated by three stages operation. Adequately performed CT followed by colonoscopy is the mainstay for diagnosis. Type 1 SVF should be treated in a single stage by complete resection and immediate anastomosis without a stoma. Type 2 cases are best managed in two stages while those with type 3 SVF are emergently managed by three stage procedure. Treatment of type 4 should be individualized.
