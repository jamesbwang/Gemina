  The geriatric population in intensive care units ( ICUs) has recently increased. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of initial complete blood count ( CBC)- related parameters and nutritional status on morbidity and mortality in geriatric ICU patients. A retrospective analysis was made of geriatric patients admitted to our tertiary adult ICU for 1 year. Patients with a length of stay ( LOS) of < 48 h , with hematological malignancy or age < 65 years age were excluded from the study. Initial albumin level was considered to reflect nutritional status. The prevelance and risk factors of mortality and microbiologically documented infection ( MDI) were analysed. The study included a total of 243 patients with a mean age of 78.96 Â± 6.62 years. The overall mortality rate was 40.7 %. The most common cause for admission was acute<disease> respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> and sepsis<disease> ( 17.2 % vs. 16.8 %). The most common MDI sources were lower respiratory<disease> tract<symptom> , bloodstream , and urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease>. Patients with thrombocytopenia<symptom> on admission had a higher mortality rate than patients with normal platelet count ( P = 0.019). The initial albumin level of non-survivors was significantly lower than that of survivors ( P = 0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between albumin level and LOS ( r = -0.157; P = 0.000). Patients with hypoalbuminemia ( albumin < 3.2 g/dL) at the time of diagnosis had higher mortality , LOS and MDI rates than those with normal albumin levels ( P < 0.05). There was no significant relationship between any other CBC-related parameter and infection and mortality ( P > 0.05). Thrombocytopenia<symptom> and hypoalbuminemia may be considered as major risk factors for morbidity and mortality in critically ill elderly patients.
