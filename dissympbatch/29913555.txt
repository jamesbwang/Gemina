  The pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy remains enigmatic. Damage to the vasa nervorum may be responsible for this disorder. Recently , we showed that secretoneurin ( SN) induces angiogenesis in hindlimb and myocardial ischemia. Moreover , beneficial effects were observed in wound<disease> healing. We therefore hypothesized that SN therapy may ameliorate diabetic neuropathy. We used db/db mice as animal model for neuropathy. Gene therapy was accomplished by intramuscular injection of SN plasmid along the sciatic nerve. Sciatic nerve<symptom> motor and sensory conduction velocities were then measured for 9 wk. Nerve conduction velocities showed normal values in heterozygous mice for the observational period , but were severely reduced in homozygous mice in which velocities were significantly improved by SN , but not by control plasmid gene therapy. The reaction time in the tail-flick test improved significantly in SN-treated animals. The induction of growth of vasa nervorum seems to be part of the underlying mechanism. In addition , SN positively affected Schwann cell function in vitro and induced activation of important signaling pathways. Our observations suggest that SN exerts beneficial effects on nerve function in vivo and on Schwann cells in vitro. It therefore may be a promising treatment option for diabetic neuropathy.-Theurl , M. , Lener , D. , Albrecht-Schgoer , K. , Beer , A. , Schgoer , W. , Liu , Y. , Stanzl , U. , Fischer-Colbrie , R. , Kirchmair , R.
