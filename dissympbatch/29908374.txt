  Matrix metalloproteinase-9 , Nitric oxide and inflammation<symptom> plays a role in the pathogenesis of poly cystic ovary syndrome<disease> ( PCOS). Even though these parameters are altered in PCOS , the effect of clomiphene citrate on them has not been studied till date. The present study was done to assess the effect of clomiphene citrate on matrix metalloproteinase-9 , nitric oxide and interleukin-10 levels in women with PCOS. 72 women diagnosed with PCOS were enrolled in the study. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 , nitric oxide and interleukin-10 levels were compared at baseline and after three weeks following Clomiphene citrate treatment. Clomiphene citrate increases both nitric oxide ( p = 0.03) and interleukin-10 ( p < 0.001) levels and reduces matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels ( p < 0.001) in women with PCOS. It also improves the ovulation rate ( 52.8 %) and clinical pregnancy rate ( 19.4 %) in PCOS. Also there was a significant reduction in matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels in both the ovulatory ( p < 0.001) and conceived groups ( p = 0.024) compared to non ovulatory and non conceived group. There was no difference in nitric oxide and interleukin-10 levels in ovulatory and conceived groups compared to non ovulatory and non conceived group. We conclude that clomiphene citrate increases the levels of nitric oxide and interleukin-10 and decreases the matrix metalloproteinase- 9 levels and improves the ovulation rate and clinical pregnancy rate in PCOS.
