  Urolithiasis has been reported in up to 1.8 % of patients after renal transplantation. Limited data are available regarding the treatment of such patients owing to this low prevalence. To analyse a consecutive series of 2115 renal transplantations to elucidate the prevalence of renal graft stones ( RGS) and their treatment. A retrospective review was performed of a consecutive series of renal transplants from 1983 to 2017. Demographic and specific data regarding symptomatology , diagnosis , and treatment of RGS were recorded. Quantitative and qualitative variables were described. Differences in clinical variables were evaluated using unpaired t test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. In total , 51 patients ( 2.4 %) were diagnosed with de novo RGS. Mean stone size was 9 Â± 6.5 mm , 31.4 % being multiple stones. The distal ureter was the most common location ( 49 %). Treatment modalities were extracorporeal shock<symptom> wave lithotripsy ( ESWL; 43.1 %) , active surveillance ( 25.4 %) , retrograde ureteroscopy ( URS; 17.6 %) , antegrade URS ( 3.9 %) , percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( 3.9 %) , open approach ( 3.9 %) , and urine alkalisation ( 2 %). Seven ( 13.7 %) patients developed complications: two haematuria , three urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> , one steinstrasse , and one sepsis<disease>. Median follow-up was 72 mo.. Overall stone-free rate was 52.9 %. No significant differences were observed between mean glomerular filtration rate before and after treatment ( p = 0.642). There were no cases of graft loss. Limitations include the retrospective nature of the study and limited number of patients. RGS is an uncommon complication. ESWL , endoscopic surgery , and surveillance have been used to treat or follow up such patients. In well-selected patients , endourological surgery appears to achieve better outcomes. RGS does not have a long-term impact on graft function or graft survival. It is uncommon to develop stones in the transplant kidney. If such stones are properly diagnosed , several minimally invasive treatment options can yield good results while maintaining good renal function.
