  Genetic heterogeneity of common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes<disease> is frequently considered. The present study conducted a focused analysis of potential candidate or susceptibility genes for common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes<disease> using multi-gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing. This study included patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy , juvenile absence epilepsy , and epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures<symptom> alone. We identified pathogenic variants according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines and identified susceptibility variants using case-control association analyses and family analyses for familial cases. A total of 57 patients were enrolled , including 51 sporadic cases and 6 familial cases. Twenty-two pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants of 16 different genes were identified. CACNA1H was the most frequently observed single gene. Variants of voltage-gated Ca2 + channel genes , including CACNA1A , CACNA1G , and CACNA1H were observed in 32 % of variants ( n = 7/22). Analyses to identify susceptibility variants using case-control association analysis indicated that KCNMA1 c. 400G > C was associated with common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes<disease>. Only 1 family ( family A) exhibited a candidate pathogenic variant p. ( Arg788His) on CACNA1H , as determined via family analyses. This study identified candidate genetic variants in about a quarter of patients ( n = 16/57) and an average of 2.8 variants was identified in each patient. The results reinforced the polygenic disorder with very high locus and allelic heterogeneity of common GGE syndromes<disease>. Further , voltage-gated Ca2 + channels are suggested as important contributors to common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes<disease>. This study extends our comprehensive understanding of common genetic generalized epilepsy
