  Epileptic<symptom> seizures<symptom> frequently occur in people with multiple sclerosis ( MS) and are thought to represent a manifestation of cortical pathology. However , at present , seizures<symptom> are not considered to be a typical clinical presentation of demyelination. In this case series , we identified four people , who presented with seizures<symptom> as a sole presenting feature , with demyelinating imaging abnormalities that satisfy current diagnostic criteria for a clinically isolated syndrome<disease> ( CIS) or early MS. Based on this case series , we propose that people presenting with de novo seizures<symptom> , with concurrent radiological abnormalities suggestive of demyelination could potentially be considered to have a CIS.
