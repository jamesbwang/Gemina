  Au-Kline syndrome<disease> ( AKS , OMIM 616580) is a multiple malformation syndrome<disease> , first reported in 2015 , associated with intellectual disability. AKS has been associated with de novo loss-of-function variants in HNRNPK ( heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein K) , and to date , only four of these patients have been described in the literature. Recently , an additional patient with a missense variant in HNRNPK was also reported. These patients have striking facial dysmorphic features , including long palpebral fissures , ptosis<symptom> , deeply grooved tongue , broad nose , and down-turned mouth<symptom>. Patients frequently also have skeletal and connective tissue anomalies , craniosynostosis , congenital heart malformations , and renal anomalies. In this report , we describe six new patients and review the clinical information on all reported AKS patients , further delineating the phenotype of AKS. There are now a total of 9 patients with de novo loss-of-function variants in HNRNPK , one individual with a de novo missense variant in addition to 3 patients with de novo deletions of 9q21 .32 that encompass HNRNPK. While there is considerable overlap between AKS and Kabuki syndrome<disease> ( KS) , these additional patients demonstrate that AKS does have a distinct facial gestalt and phenotype that can be differentiated from KS. This growing AKS patient cohort also informs an emerging approach to management and health surveillance for these patients.
