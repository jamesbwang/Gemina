  Sepsis<disease> can result in severe organ injury by provoking inflammatory cascades and oxidative stress. Several studies are currently underway to find a drug with anti-inflammatory effects to prevent mortality and morbidity during sepsis<disease>. The present study was undertaken to assess the effects of metformin on oxidative stress and antioxidant status in sepsis<disease> induced by the Cecal Ligation and Puncture ( CLP) method. Male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups ( n = 10): sham , CLP , and 50 and 100 mg/kg metformin-treated CLP groups. After 12 hr , blood samples were collected and lung tissue was removed for histopathological study to detect tissue damage and degree of inflammation<symptom> based on neutrophil infiltration and assay of the oxidative stress biomarkers superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , total antioxidant capacity ( TAC) , malondialdehyde ( MDA) , myeloperoxidase ( MPO) , glutathione peroxidase ( GPx) , and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1). The MPO activity and MDA level were decreased in the metformin-treated groups ( It was concluded that metformin protects lung tissue against sepsis-induced oxidative damage , and this protective effect may be more related to its anti-inflammatory and reduced neutrophil accumulation and less to its anti-oxidative properties.
