  The prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders ( FGIDs) in Argentinean children and adolescents has not yet been studied. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of FGIDs among children and adolescents in Argentina using the Rome III diagnostic criteria. A total of 483 children , 12-18 years of age , from 3 private schools and 3 public schools , were included in the study. Each child completed the Spanish version of the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-Rome III) , which is an age-appropriate and previously validated instrument for diagnosing FGIDs according to the Rome III criteria. Sociodemographic data ( age , sex , type of school , family structure and size , family history of gastrointestinal disorders) and data on stressful life events were also obtained. The mean age of the population studied was 15 years ( standard deviation 1.74 , range 12-18 , 52.8 % boys). Of the respondents , 229 children ( 47.4 %) attended private school and 254 children ( 52.6 %) attended public school. In total , 82 children ( 17.0 %) were diagnosed with an FGID , according to the Rome III criteria. Abdominal migraine ( 16.4 %) was the most common diagnosis , followed by irritable bowel syndrome<disease> ( 7.0 %) , functional constipation<symptom> ( 6.4 %) , and aerophagia ( 5.6 %). Girls suffered significantly more from FGIDs than boys ( 22.4 vs. 12.2 % , P = .0032). Children attending private school had significantly more FGIDs than children in public schools ( 20.5 vs. 13.8 % , P = .0499). FGIDs are common among Argentinean children and adolescents.
