  Defects in mucus and intestinal epithelia can lead to intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> in colitis<disease>. Reduced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPAR Chronic colitis<disease> was induced in C57BL/6 mice by administration of dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS) for 27 days. Three days before DSS treatment , mice were treated with the PPAR The colitis<disease> based on disease activity index and colonic histopathology was significantly ameliorated in the DSS + Ro group. Additionally , mice in the DSS + Ro group had a thicker mucous layer than those in DSS + NS group , and muc2 mRNA expression was elevated significantly along with the mouse atonal homolog , SAM-pointed domain-containing Ets-like factor , and anterior gradient 2 genes. Moreover , tight junctions were up-regulated , whereas long myosin light chain kinase and phosphorylation of the myosin II light chain were lower in DSS + Ro mice. Similarly , after HT-29 and Caco-2 cells were treated by LPS or LPS + Ro , PPAR Our results demonstrate that activated PPAR
