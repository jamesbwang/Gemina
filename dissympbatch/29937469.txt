  Several epidemiological studies have determined the relationship between diabetes and the incidence and/or prevalence of recently identified comorbid conditions ( cancer , periodontal<disease> disease<disease> , fracture , cognitive impairment , and depression<symptom> These relationships may vary by country or race/ethnicity. We aimed to systematically review studies in this field conducted with the Japanese population because such a review in the Japanese population has never been undertaken. We conducted systematic literature searches in PubMed and Ichushi-Web databases for studies published until December 2016. Studies comparing the incidence and/or prevalence of the comorbidities among the Japanese population were included. The studies were classified as integrated analyses , cohort studies , case-control studies , or cross-sectional studies. We identified 33 studies ( cancer: 17 , periodontal<disease> disease<disease> 5 , fracture: 5 , cognitive impairment: 4 , and depression<symptom> 2). Although several cohort studies and meta-analyses had assessed the development of cancer in diabetes , there was scant epidemiological evidence for the other conditions. Indeed , only one cohort study each had been conducted for periodontal<disease> disease<disease> , fracture , and cognitive impairment , whereas other evidence was cross-sectional , some of which was induced from baseline characteristic tables of studies designed for other purposes. In Japan , there is insufficient evidence about the relationship between diabetes and the incidence/prevalence of periodontal<disease> disease<disease> , fracture , cognitive impairment , and depression<symptom> By contrast , several cohort studies and integrated analyses have been conducted for the relationship with cancer. Further studies should be undertaken to estimate the contribution of diabetes on the incidence/prevalence of comorbidities that may be specific to the Japanese population.
