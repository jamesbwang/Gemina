  The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term outcome of simple trapeziectomy by a single surgeon and to compare this with pre-operative function. Two hundred and five patients completed the shortened disabilities of the arm , shoulder and hand questionnaire ( QuickDASH) and the EuroQoL five-dimensional questionnaire ( EQ-5D) scores at a mean of 8.2 ( range 3.5-17) years after simple trapeziectomy. There were no pre-operative scores available , so case controls were selected from our prospective database to compare pre- and post-operative patient-reported outcome measures. The mean QuickDASH score of the post-operative matched group was 37 ( SD 17.0) and the mean EQ-5D was 0.56 ( SD 0.31). The mean QuickDASH score of the pre-operative group was 54 ( SD 17.0). The mean difference in QuickDASH between the pre- and post-operative groups was 17 ( 95 % CI: 8 to 26 , p = 0.0003). This study demonstrated a significant and sustained improvement in patient-reported function after simple trapeziectomy. It supports that simple trapeziectomy is a simple , safe and effective treatment for advanced trapeziometacarpal joint<symptom> arthritis<disease>. IV.
