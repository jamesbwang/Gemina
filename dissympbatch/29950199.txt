  To investigate the expression of LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) and to analyze the relation of LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 expression levels with clinicopathological features. A total of 68 patients with AML were enrolled in the study , 48 out of them were suffered from acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) and 20 reached to complete remission ( CR) , 30 age-matched patients with iron-deficient anemia<symptom> were included in control group , the peripheral blood samples of all the patients were collected , and the real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR ( qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 , meanwhile , the correlation of its expression with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis was analyzed. The expression of LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 in AML patients was significantly higher than that in the patient with complete remission and iron-deficient anemia<symptom> ( F = 14.67 , P < 0.01). The expression of LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 was not significantly different between 20 cases of AML-CR and 30 cases of iron-deficient anemia<symptom> ( P > 0.05). The expression of LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 was associated with NCCN risk grade and survival status in patients with AML. The median overall survival time was significantly shorter in patients with high expression of LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 than that in patients with low expression ( P < 0.05). LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 may be involved in the regulation of AML. Expression of LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 and NCCN risk score can be used as biomarkers of prognosis in the patients with AML and may be a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for AML patients.
