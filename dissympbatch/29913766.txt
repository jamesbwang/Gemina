  Introduction Correctly identifying chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> patients with posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) is important because the comorbidity of a chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> condition and PTSD is found to compromise treatment success. In addition , the existence of PTSD is associated with pain sensitisation , elevated levels of pain , and disability. Furthermore , the diagnostic criteria for PTSD has changed dramatically in the last two decades which has had a profound impact on the reported prevalence rates of PTSD in chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> samples. To our knowledge , no study has employed the DSM-IV criteria for estimating the prevalence of PTSD in chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> patients referred consecutively for multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation. Aim The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of significant traumatic stressors and PTSD in chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> patients referred consecutively to multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation. We wanted to investigate whether specific pain diagnoses were more related to PTSD than others. Moreover , we investigated the possible association of altered sensory processing ( hypersensitivity<disease> or hyposensitivity) and PTSD. Methods Data were collected from two Scandinavian multidisciplinary pain centres ( Denmark and Finland). All patients referred consecutively were assessed for PTSD and sensitisation at admission. A total of 432 patients were assessed , of which 304 ( DK , N = 220 , female n = 144; FIN , N = 84 , female n = 44) were admitted and consented to participate. All patients had to be diagnosed with a non-malign chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> condition lasting for at least 6 months ( median = 6.0 years). The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire was employed to measure PTSD symptoms , using the DSM-IV criteria. To measure altered sensory processing , anaesthetists performed quantitative sensory testing on admission. Patients were asked to report if cold , brush , and pinprick mechanical stimulation resulted in decreased or increased sensation or pain. Results stimulation resulted in decreased or increased sensation or pain. A high prevalence of PTSD was found in both consecutive samples. Using the DSM-IV criteria , 23 % fulfilled the criteria for a possible PTSD diagnosis. There were no gender differences in PTSD. The three most reported traumatic events: traffic accidents , serious illness personally or in the family , and the actual loss of someone , were reported as the primary traumatic events by almost 50 % of those with PTSD. No particular pain diagnosis was significantly related to PTSD. However , hypersensitivity<disease> to cold and hyposensitivity to brush were significantly associated with PTSD. Discussion The prevalence of PTSD in the present study was 23 %. Earlier studies finding a lower prevalence rate of PTSD may reflect the use of older diagnostic criteria for PTSD or other estimates , for instance PTSD symptom cut-off scores. Conclusion The study emphasised the importance of screening all chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> patients for PTSD at admission for pain rehabilitation , using up to date diagnostic tools. Implications Untreated PTSD may exacerbate or maintain the pain condition and negatively affect outcome of pain rehabilitation.
