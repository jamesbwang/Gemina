  Prurigo is defined by the presence of chronic pruritus and multiple localized or generalized pruriginous lesions<symptom>. The aim of this study was to assess the psychological burden of prurigo in patients of European countries. In this multicentre European study , 3635 general dermatology outpatients and 1359 controls were included. Socio-demographic data and answers to questionnaires ( regarding quality of life , general health , anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> and suicidal ideation) were collected. There were 27 patients with prurigo; of these , 63 % were men , and the mean age was 58.6 years. Among patients with prurigo , 10 of 27 ( 37 %) suffered from anxiety<symptom> and 8 of 27 ( 29 %) from depression<symptom> Suicidal ideation was reported in 5 of 27 ( 19 %) patients , and for four of these five patients , suicidal ideation was related to their skin disease. These frequencies were higher in the 10 commonest dermatological diseases ( including psoriasis , atopic dermatitis<disease> and leg ulcers<disease>). The impact on quality of life was severe , with a mean Dermatologic Life Quality Index ( DLQI) of 12.4 , with an extreme impact on quality of life for 23 % of patients and a very large impact for 27 % of patients. The psychological comorbidities of prurigo are common , greater than those of other skin diseases , and their impact on quality of life is significant. Thus , it is important to study this condition and to find new treatments.
