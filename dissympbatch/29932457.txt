  Epidermolysis bullosa simplex<disease> generalized severe is a genetic disorder caused by mutation in KRT5 or KRT14 genes. Usually considered as a mechanical disease , recent data argue for additional inflammatory mechanisms. The aim of this study was to assess the inflammation<symptom> in the skin of patients with EBS. A first immunohistochemical retrospective study was performed on frozen skin samples from 17 EBS-gen sev patients. A second multicenter prospective study was conducted on 10 patients with severe EBS-gen sev. Blister fluid and epidermis were processed for immunochemistry analysis and quantitative real time PCR. Cytokine expression was analyzed in blister fluid and compared with controls. Histological analysis showed a constant dermal perivascular CD4 + lymphocytes infiltrate in skin biopsies of blister ( n = 17) as well as in rubbed skin ( n = 5) , an epidermal infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils in 70 % of cases and an increased immunostaining for CXCL9 and CXCL10 in blistering skin. High levels of Th17 cytokines were detected in lesional skin. Three adult patients with EBS-gen sev were treated with apremilast with a dramatic improvement of skin blistering and good tolerance. Our study demonstrates the importance of inflammation<symptom> in EBS-gen sev patients and underlines the key role for Th17 cells in its pathogenesis. In addition , this study provides promising new therapeutic approaches for this disabling disorder. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
