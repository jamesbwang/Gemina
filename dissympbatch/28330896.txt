  The success of dendritic cell ( DC)- based immunotherapeutics critically hinges on the capacity of the vascularly administered cells to enter tissues. Transendothelial migration ( TEM) is dictated by an ordered cascade of receptor/ligand interactions. In this study , we examined the key molecular effectors of TEM of human monocyte-derived DCs ( mo-DCs) generated by clinically relevant methods: CD14 selection ( CD14-S) and plastic adherence selection ( PA-S). Without chemokine input , CD14-S cells undergo greater TEM than PA-S cells over TNF-Î±-stimulated HUVECs. TEM of CD14-S mo-DCs is E-selectin/very late Ag-4 ( VLA-4) dependent , and engagement of E-selectin ligands activates VLA-4 on CD14-S mo-DCs but not on PA-S mo-DCs. E-selectin binding glycoforms of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 ( PSGL-1) ( i.e. , cutaneous lymphocyte<symptom> Ag ( CLA)) and CD44 ( i.e. , hematopoietic cell E-selectin/L-selectin ligand ( HCELL)) are both expressed on CD14-S mo-DCs , but only CLA is expressed on PA-S mo-DCs. To elucidate the effect of CD44 or PSGL-1 engagement , mo-DCs were pretreated with their ligands. Ligation of CD44 on CD14-S mo-DCs triggers VLA-4 activation and TEM , whereas PSGL-1 ligation does not. HCELL expression on CD14-S mo-DC can be enforced by cell surface exofucosylation , yielding increased TEM in vitro and enhanced extravasation into bone<disease> marrow in vivo. These findings highlight structural and functional pleiotropism of CD44 in priming TEM of mo-DCs and suggest that strategies to enforce HCELL expression may boost TEM of systemically administered CD14-S mo-DCs.
