  To determine the genetic etiology and clinical characteristics of 2 boys featuring development delay ( DD). Routine chromosomal banding was performed to analyze the karyotypes of the patients and their parents. Single nucleotide polymorphism array ( SNP array) analysis was employed to identify pathogenic deletion/duplication of chromosomes , and quantitative real-time PCR ( qPCR) was performed to confirm the results. Patient 1 showed a global developmental delay , especially impaired language development , seizures<symptom> , behavioral problems belonging to the autism spectrum and mild facial dysmorphism. Patient 2 mainly presented with severely delayed speech and moderate intellectual disability , but did not have obvious facial dysmorphism and autistic-like behavior. The diagnosis of 22q13 syndrome<disease> was established based on identification of a heterozygous microdeletion at chromosome 22q13 .33 in both patients ( 69 kb and 587 kb , respectively) by the SNP array analysis. Both patients had deletions of SHANK3 and ACR , which are located at the end of 22q. Quantitative real-time PCR verified that the deletion of SHANK3 gene in both patients were de novo in origin. Two cases of 22q13 deletion syndrome<disease> have been diagnosed by SNP array analysis. Deletion of SHANK3 gene may be the major contributor to the clinical manifestations of the patients. SNP array analysis can facilitate discovery of microdeletions , which has played an important role in the diagnosis and genetic counseling for the family.
