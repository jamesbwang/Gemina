  Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy ( HPOA) is a paraneoplastic manifestation of gastric and , more frequently , lung carcinomas. It is characterized by extremity pain , clubbing , arthritis<disease> and periostitis of the long bones. Periostitis is the hallmark of HPOA and can be revealed with bone scintigraphy. Whole-body bone scintigraphy ( WBBS) is very sensitive during the active lesion<symptom> period and WBBS findings usually precede that of plain radiography. WBBS can also show improvement in the first 6 months following treatment , thus making it an important technique in the management and follow-up of these patients. While HPOA findings are usually seen in the lower extremities , involvement of both upper and lower extremities is a rare condition. In this case report , it is aimed to present findings of a 67-year-old male patient with lung cancer and complaint of extremity pain. We report on this patient to draw attention to HPOA of both upper and lower extremities.
