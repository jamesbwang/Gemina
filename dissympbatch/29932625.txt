  Inhibiting ice accumulation on surfaces is an energy-intensive task and is of significant importance in nature and technology where it has found applications in windshields , automobiles , aviation , renewable energy generation , and infrastructure. Existing methods rely on on-site electrical heat generation , chemicals , or mechanical removal , with drawbacks ranging from financial costs to disruptive technical interventions and environmental incompatibility. Here we focus on applications where surface transparency is desirable and propose metasurfaces with embedded plasmonically enhanced light absorption heating , using ultrathin hybrid metal-dielectric coatings , as a passive , viable approach for de-icing and anti-icing , in which the sole heat source is renewable solar energy. The balancing of transparency and absorption is achieved with rationally nanoengineered coatings consisting of gold nanoparticle inclusions<disease> in a dielectric ( titanium dioxide) , concentrating broadband absorbed solar energy into a small volume. This causes a > 10 Â°C temperature increase with respect to ambient at the air-solid interface , where ice is most likely to form , delaying freezing , reducing ice adhesion , when it occurs , to negligible levels ( de-icing) and inhibiting frost formation ( anti-icing). Our results illustrate an effective unexplored pathway toward environmentally compatible , solar-energy-driven icephobicity , enabled by respectively tailored plasmonic metasurfaces , with the ability to design the balance<symptom> of transparency and light absorption.
