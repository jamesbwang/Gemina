  Acute kidney injury ( AKI) is one of the most important complications of bothropic poisoning<disease> and its early identification remains challenging. The nephrotoxicity of Bothrops insularis venom ( BinsV) was previously described by our research group. In this study , we continued to evaluate the effect of BinsV on kidney function in mice and LLC-MK2 proximal tubule cells , evaluating KIM-1 protein as an early AKI biomarker. Male Swiss mice were inoculated with BinsV intramuscularly and observed for 24 h in a metabolic cage model. Urine and blood were collected for biochemical analyses and the kidneys were examined for oxide-reducing balance<symptom> and submitted to histological analysis. LLC-MK2 cells incubated with BinsV were assessed for cell viability and cell death mechanism by flow cytometry. Histological analysis of the kidneys indicated AKI and the oxide-reducing analyses demonstrated a decreasing in reduced glutathione ( GSH) levels and an increasing on Malondialdehyde ( MDA) levels. BinsV was cytotoxic to LLC-MK2 and the cytometry analyses suggested necrosis<symptom>. Within 24 h after the envenomation , urinary creatinine did not increase , but the urinary levels of KIM-1 increased. In conclusion , we found AKI evidence in the kidney tissue and the increase in the KIM-1 levels suggest it can be used as an early AKI biomarker.
