  The cardiac fibroblast plays a central role in tissue homeostasis and in repair after injury. With aging , dysregulated cardiac fibroblasts have a reduced capacity to activate a canonical transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β)- Smad pathway and differentiate poorly into contractile myofibroblasts. That results in the formation of an insufficient scar after myocardial infarction ( MI). By contrast , in the uninjured aged heart fibroblasts are activated and acquire a pro-fibrotic phenotype that leads to interstitial fibrosis<disease> , ventricular stiffness , and diastolic dysfunction , all conditions that may lead to heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. There is an apparent paradox in aging , wherein reparative fibrosis<disease> is impaired but interstitial , adverse fibrosis<disease> is augmented. This could be explained by analyzing the effectiveness of signaling pathways in resident fibroblasts from young versus aged hearts. While defective signaling by transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β) leads to insufficient scar formation by myofibroblasts , enhanced activation of the ERK1/2 pathway may be responsible for interstitial fibrosis<disease> mediated by activated fibroblasts.
