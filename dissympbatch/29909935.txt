  Sedentary behavior and low physical activity are associated with incident diabetes , cardiovascular disease , and early mortality. Previous studies have examined associations between chronic kidney disease ( CKD) and physical activity , but little is known about the role of sedentary time. Cross-sectional national survey. A nationally representative sample of adults ( n = 8,444) participating in the Canadian Health Measures Survey 's ( CHMS) activity monitoring component ( 2007-2013). Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR). Sedentary time ( total sedentary minutes/total wear time) measured using triaxial accelerometry. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression for quartiles of sedentary time and linear regression for sedentary time measured on a continuous scale were performed in the entire study population and in the subgroup with CKD. Mean proportion of sedentary time ranged from 58 % ( least sedentary quartile: Q1) to 81 % ( most sedentary quartile: Q4). Lower eGFR , older age , lower serum albumin level , higher blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and higher body mass index were independently associated with a higher proportion of sedentary time. Patients with eGFRs < 45mL/min/1 .73 m Cross-sectional design precluded evaluation of longitudinal outcomes and establishment of the causal nature of observed associations. Small sample of individuals with advanced CKD. In this cross-sectional survey , reduced eGFR was strongly and independently associated with greater sedentary time. This risk was further heightened by the presence of diabetes and arthritis<disease>. Studies to determine causes for sedentary behavior and assess the feasibility and value of interventions to reduce sedentary time in CKD are needed.
