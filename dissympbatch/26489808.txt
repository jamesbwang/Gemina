  Asian Indian women are predisposed to develop obesity , metabolic syndrome<disease> and vitamin D deficiency. Relationship of vitamin D deficiency with blood glucose levels has not been explored in Asian Indian women with pre-diabetes. We evaluated the associations of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D concentrations among adult women with the pre-diabetes residing in North India ( Delhi). This cross-sectional population-based study involved 797 women with pre-diabetes aged 20-60 years. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , body mass index ( BMI) , fasting blood glucose ( FBG) , extent of sun exposure and serum 25 ( OH) D levels were assessed. For purpose of analysis , serum 25 ( OH) D levels ( nmol/L) were categorized in quintiles as follows: 0-21.5 ( first quintile) , 21.51-35.60 ( second quintile) , 35.61-46.50 ( third quintile) , 46.51-62.30 ( fourth quintile) and > 62.31 ( fifth quintile). The prevalence ( %) of vitamin D deficiency , insufficiency and sufficiency was 68.6 , 25.9 and 5.5 , respectively. Mean age ( p = 0.004) , systolic ( p = 0.05) and diastolic ( p = 0.04) blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , weight ( p = 0.03) , BMI ( p = 0.04) and FBG ( p = 0.02) were significantly higher in subjects with vitamin D deficiency as compared with those with vitamin D insufficiency and sufficiency. Unadjusted mean values of FBG were significantly decreased in fourth ( p = 0.02) and fifth quintiles ( p = 0.030) of 25 ( OH) D levels as compared with second quintile. Furthermore , after adjusting for age and family income FBG levels were significantly increased in first quintile ( compared with fourth ( p = 0.012) and fifth ( p = 0.018) quintiles) and second quintile ( compared with fourth ( p = 0.003) and fifth ( p = 0.004) quintiles) of 25 ( OH) D levels , respectively. Lower vitamin D levels are associated with higher blood glucose values in Asian Indian women with pre-diabetes. These findings need confirmation in case-control and prospective studies.
