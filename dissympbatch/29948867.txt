  Radiation-induced ureteral stricture disease poses significant surgical challenges. Ureteral substitution with ileum has long been a versatile option for reconstruction. We evaluated outcomes in patients undergoing ileal ureter replacement for ureteral reconstruction due to radiation-induced ureteral stricture versus other causes. Between July 1989 and June 2013 , 155 patients underwent consecutive ileal ureter creation. The study cohort included 104 patients with complete data sets and at least 7 months of follow up. Records were retrospectively reviewed with regard to demographics , indications , complications , and renal deterioration. Surgical indications included radiation-induced stricture in 23 ( 22 %) and non-radiation-induced stricture in 81 ( 78 %). Comparing ileal ureter substitution due to radiation versus other stricture etiologies , no statistical significance was observed in regard to age ( 45.6 vs. 51.2 , p = 0.141) , hospital length of stay in days ( 8.8 vs. 7.7 , p = 0.216) , percent GFR loss ( MDRD-4 vs. -5 % , p = 0.670 and CKD-EPI-7 vs. -6 % , p = 0.914) , 30-day surgical complications ( 26.1 vs. 30.1 % , p = 0.658) , metabolic acidosis ( 8.7 vs. 1.2 % , p = 0.059) , and renal<symptom> failure<symptom> requiring dialysis ( 4.3 vs. 1.2 % , p = 0.337). Fistula<disease> formation ( 13.0 vs. 3.7 % , p = 0.095) , partial small bowel obstructions ( 21.7 vs. 7.4 % , p = 0.063) , and small bowel obstructions requiring reoperation ( 13.0 vs. 1.2 % , p = 0.033) approached or reached statistical significance. Using Kaplan-Meier methodology , there was no difference in time to worsening renal outcome between the radiation and non-radiation groups ( p > 0.05). Ureteral substitution with ileum is an effective reconstructive option for radiation-induced ureteral strictures in carefully selected patients.
