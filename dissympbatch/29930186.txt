  A 45-year-old man without previous comorbidity presented to us with acute onset right-sided flank pain for last 14 hours. His general physical and systemic examination was unremarkable , and there were no clinical signs of peritonitis<disease> The ultrasonography did not reveal any evidence of nephrolithiasis or hydronephrosis. His contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed hypoattenuated areas of right kidney and evidence of right<symptom> renal artery thrombosis. He was immediately shifted to cardiac catheterisation lab , and his renal angiography showed thrombotic occlusion of right<symptom> renal artery. The bolus dose of streptokinase ( 250000 IU) was given locally in renal artery by right judkins catheter followed by systemic infusion of streptokinase ( 100000 IU/hour) for 24 hours. After that he was started on low molecular weight heparin. Repeat renal angiography done after 5 days showed completely normal right<symptom> renal artery. His cardiac and thrombophilia work up was negative , and he was discharged on antiplatelets , oral anticoagulants and statins.
