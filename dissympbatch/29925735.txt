  Hexavalent chromium ( Cr ( VI)) compounds are recognized as carcinogens in the respiratory<disease> tract<symptom> , giving rise to cancers of the lung , nose and nasal sinuses , especially in certain occupational environments. Inhalation exposure of Cr ( VI)- containing particles , dusts and fumes commonly occurs in chromium-related occupational environments , such as chromium production , plating , welding of chromium-containing metals and alloys , electroplating , chromium-containing pigments and paints. Epidemiological surveys of chromium compounds have shown strong associations between exposure to Cr ( VI) and mortality due to lung cancer , as well as positive associations with cancers of the nose and nasal cavity. Nasal symptoms , such as nasal irritation , ulceration and perforation of the nasal septum , nasal turbinate engorgement and hypertrophy , are important signs for the early diagnosis of lung cancer and cancers of the nose and nasal cavity in those with an occupational history of Cr ( VI) exposure. Cr ( VI) exposure in the workplace remains a serious problem as a cause of lung cancer and cancers of nose and nasal cavity , especially in relatively small enterprises that use chromium compounds. Appropriate protection for workers should be considered in occupations that involve exposure to chromium compounds.
