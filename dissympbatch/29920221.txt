  Psoriasis is an inflammatory autoimmune skin disorder possessing a complex etiology related to genetic and environmental triggers. Keratinocytes show a potential role for the origin of psoriasis. In this study , we estimated the efficiency of 2 anthranilate derivatives- ( E) -4- ( N- ( 2- ( 1- ( hydroxyimino) ethyl) phenyl) sulfamoyl) phenyl pivalate ( HFP031) and butyl 2- ( 2- ( 2-fluorophenyl) acetamido) benzoate ( HFP034)- on psoriasis amelioration in a mouse model. The results showed that topical treatment with both compounds could attenuate epidermal thickness and scaling in an imiquimod ( IMQ)- induced psoriasis mouse model via decreased expression of cytokines and chemokines ( C-X-C chemokine ligand ( CXCL) 1 and CXCL2) , leading to the reduction of neutrophilic abscess<disease> in the skin. The in vivo cutaneous absorption of HFP034 was 7.6-fold greater than that of HFP031. Both compounds caused negligible irritation on healthy mouse skin. In addition , we examined the effect of the anthranilate derivatives on chemokine expression in IMQ-treated HaCaT keratinocytes. Our results elucidated a mechanism for anti-inflammatory activity of HFP034 that involved the elevation of intracellular cAMP concentration , suppression of NF-ÎºB activity , and attenuation of neutrophil chemoattractant expression. These results suggest that HFP034 could increase the cutaneous concentration of cAMP to suppress neutrophil infiltration into the skin. Topically applied HFP034 may demonstrate a potential for future clinical application as a novel therapy for psoriasis treatment.-Lin , Z.-C. , Hsieh , P.-W. , Hwang , T.-L. , Chen , C.-Y. , Sung , C.

Topical application of anthranilate derivatives ameliorates psoriatic inflammation<symptom> in a mouse model by inhibiting keratinocyte-derived chemokine expression and neutrophil infiltration.
