  To detect potential mutations of the glutamate receptor subunit ( GRIN2A) gene and delineate the clinical-genetic characteristics of patients with epilepsy-aphasia spectrum ( EAS) disorders. One hundred twenty two patients with Landau-Kleffner syndrome<disease> ( LKS) , epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep ( CSWS) , benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes ( BECT) and BECT variants were recruited. Potential mutations of the GRIN2A gene were screened with Sanger sequencing. And clinical-genetic characteristics for all patients were analyzed. The patients have included 9 LKS , 26 CSWS , 42 BECT variants and 45 BECT. The mean age of onset of seizure<symptom> or aphasia<symptom> was 5 years old ( 10 months to 11 years). Mutation screening has detected 4 possible pathogenic missense mutations including c. 2278G > A ( p.G760S) , c. 4153G > T ( p.D1385Y) , c. 1364G > A ( p.C455Y) and c. 691T > C ( p.C231R) in four unrelated probands , which comprised one case with LKS and three with BECT variants. The mutation rate was 11.1 % ( 1/9) for LKS and 7.2 % ( 3/42) for BECT variants. No GRIN2A mutation was found in the 26 patients with CSWS and 45 patients with BECT. Among the 122 probands , 25 ( 20.5 %) patients without a GRIN2A mutation had a positive family history of febrile seizures<symptom> or epilepsy. GRIN2A mutation do exist in EAS patients , but with a relatively low rate. A proportion of EAS patients without a GRIN2A mutation have a positive family history , which suggested a complex mechanism for EAS.
