  This study investigated the relationship between drinking behavior ( alcohol consumption frequency , average alcohol intake per drinking session) and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) and its components ( central obesity , raised triglycerides , decreased HDL cholesterol , raised blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , raised fasting plasma glucose) in Korean men and women above the age of 20. Our study employed data from the Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey ( KNHANES) for the years 2007-2013. The study population consisted of a total of 16,507 Korean males and 22,548 females; 30.0 % ( n = 4908) of all males and 29.8 % ( n = 6663) of all females were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome<disease>. Relative to abstaining males , males who consumed alcohol more than 2-3 times per week ( OR: 1.32 , 95 % CI: 1.04-1.66) , as well as those who consumed more than 10 drinks per drinking session ( OR: 1.71 , 95 % CI 1.41-2.08) had greatly increased odds risk of MetS. Alcohol consumption frequency was not associated with increased odds risk of MetS for females , however. Relative to abstaining females , females who consumed just 3-4 drinks per session had a 17 % increased odds risk of MetS ( OR: 1.17 , 95 % CI: 1.02-1.35). Females consuming more than 10 drinks per drinking session ( OR: 1.91 , 95 % CI 1.44-2.52) were likely to have a 91 % increase in odds risk of MetS. For males , alcohol consumption frequency was associated with high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and high fasting plasma glucose levels , while average alcohol intake per drinking session was associated with central obesity , high triglyceride levels , high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and high fasting plasma glucose. For females , alcohol intake per session was associated with central obesity , high triglycerides , raised blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and high fasting plasma glucose. Frequent alcohol consumption and high alcohol intake per drinking session were associated with higher prevalence of MetS and its components for Korean men; alcohol intake per drinking session only was associated with higher prevalence of MetS and its components for Korean women.
