  While bubble continuous positive airway pressure ( bCPAP) is commonly used in low- and middle-income countries ( LMIC) to support neonates with respiratory distress , there are limited non-invasive support options for non-neonatal children. To demonstrate safety of a new device designed to support children during respiratory distress in LMIC. A paediatric bCPAP device was designed called SEAL-bCPAP ( Simplified Ear-plug Adapted-bCPAP). SEAL-bCPAP is constructed from inexpensive , easily obtainable materials. The nasal prong interface was modified from previously described neonatal bCPAP set-ups using commercial ear-plug material to improve nasal seal<disease>. A prospective interventional study was conducted to evaluate safety in children with respiratory distress treated with SEAL-bCPAP. Patients aged 30 days to 5 years presenting to a hospital in northern Uganda from July 2015 to June 2016 were screened. Those with moderate-severe respiratory distress and/or hypoxia despite nasal cannula oxygen were eligible for study. Enrolled patients were supported with SEAL-bCPAP until respiratory improvement or death. Complications attributable to SEAL-bCPAP were recorded. Clinical outcomes were compared with historical control pre-trial data. Eighty-three of 87 enrolled patients were included in the final analysis. No patients had significant SEAL-bCPAP complications. Five patients had mild complications which resolved ( four with nasal irritation and one with abdominal<symptom> distention<symptom>). Trial patients had significant ( p < 0.0001) improvement in their TAL score , respiratory rate and O The SEAL-bCPAP device is safe for treatment of respiratory distress in non-neonatal children in LMIC. There is a trend toward decreased mortality that should be evaluated with adequately powered clinical trials.
