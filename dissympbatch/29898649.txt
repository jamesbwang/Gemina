  Cancer cachexia , one of the metabolic syndromes<disease> caused by cancer , is a devastating and miserable condition encountered in more than 50 % of terminal cancer patients presenting with significant weight<symptom> loss<symptom> associated with skeletal muscle atrophy and fat loss. Though cachexia may account for up to 20 % of cancer deaths , no significant treatment is still lacking and is of urgent unmet medical need in cancer treatment. Therefore , understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms is essential for anticipating therapeutic approaches. Since the primary events driving cachexia are mediated via either the central nervous system related- or inflammation<symptom> related-anorexia , hypoanabolism , and hypercatabolism , therapy usually targets nutritional support to compensate reduced food intake along with some anti-inflammatory agents to cover specific inflammation-related metabolic derangement , and encourages exercise to supplement reduced physical activity , but all proven to be not so effective so far. Therefore , combination therapies such as a standard multi-modal package including an anorexic agent , megestrol acetate , and anti-inflammatory agent coupled with the development of potential novel therapeutics promise a new era in rescuing patients from cancer cachexia. In this review , we propose the potential application of BPC157 , one of the active cytoprotective agents isolated from gastric juices for cancer cachexia. Before clinical trial , we introduced the evidence showing BPC157 rescued from cancer cachexia supported with explored mode of actions.
