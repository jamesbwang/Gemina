  Macrophages are prominent cells in acute and chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>. Recent studies highlight a role for macrophage proliferation post monocyte recruitment in inflammatory conditions. Using an acute peritonitis<disease> model , we identify a significant defect in macrophage proliferation in mice lacking leukocyte transmembrane protease ADAM17. The defect is associated with decreased levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 ( CSF-1) in the peritoneum , and is rescued by intraperitoneal injection of CSF-1. Cell surface CSF-1 ( csCSF-1) is one of the substrates of ADAM17. We demonstrate that both neutrophils and macrophages are major sources of csCSF-1. Furthermore , acute shedding of csCSF-1 following neutrophil extravasation is associated with elevated expression of iRhom2 , a member of the rhomboid-like superfamily , which promotes ADAM17 maturation and trafficking to the neutrophil surface. Accordingly , deletion of hematopoietic iRhom2 is sufficient to prevent csCSF-1 release from neutrophils and macrophages , and to prevent macrophage proliferation. In acute<symptom> inflammation<symptom> , csCSF-1 release and macrophage proliferation are self-limiting due to transient leukocyte recruitment and temporally restricted csCSF-1 expression. In chronic inflammation<symptom> such as atherosclerosis , the ADAM17-mediated lesional macrophage proliferative response is prolonged. Our results demonstrate a novel mechanism whereby ADAM17 promotes macrophage proliferation in states of acute and chronic
