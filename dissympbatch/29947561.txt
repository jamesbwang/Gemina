  Low physical activity has long been identified as a risk factor for coronary heart disease. The aim of this study was to determine the factors that influence changes in the physical activity of patients following an acute coronary syndrome<disease> event. The prospective , inferential cohort design recruited patients admitted to hospital following an acute coronary syndrome<disease> event across five research sites. Physical activity was assessed using the short form international physical activity questionnaire. Data were collected at baseline and 3 months on 380 patients. The sample profile was: 21 % women; body mass index 28 ± 4.6; unstable angina 36 %; ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction 25 %; non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction 39 % and a mean age of 63 ± 11.8. There was a significant improvement in physical activity at 3 months ( n = 380 , t = -3.704 , P ≤ 0.001). All regression models , baseline , 3 months and change in physical activity were significant ( p ≤ 0.001). Low physical activity was associated with: at baseline not having health insurance , older age and depression<symptom> at 3 months not having health insurance , not in employment and low baseline physical activity; and improvement in physical activity was associated with low physical activity at baseline and not being in employment. While physical activity improved significantly , 45 % did not reach guideline recommendation levels at 3 months post-event. Physical activity change was little influenced by sociodemographic , clinical , psychological and behavioural factors , suggesting the need to look elsewhere such as behavioural change and improved processes across the care divide to improve physical activity in this at-risk population.
