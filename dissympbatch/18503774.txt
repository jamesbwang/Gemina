  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) , the most common cause of liver disease , affects approximately 75 to 100 million Americans. Patients with concurrent NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus have a higher risk of progressing to advanced fibrosis<disease> and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis compared to non-diabetics. Lifestyle modifications , including weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , remain the mainstay of treatment for NAFLD , as there are no medications currently indicated for this disease state. Anti-diabetic pharmacologic therapies aimed at improving insulin sensitivity and decreasing insulin production have been studied to determine their potential role in slowing the progression of NAFLD. In this review , we focus on the evidence surrounding anti-diabetic medications and their ability to improve disease progression in patients with NAFLD.
