  Sepsis<disease> is a major global health problem and represents a challenge for physicians all over the world. The knowledge of sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom> is a topic of interest among the scientific community and society in general. New guidelines for management of sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom> were developed in 2016 , providing an update on this area. In Sepsis-3 new definitions for sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom> were published. The purpose of this narrative review is to discuss and compare the new criteria of 2016 with the old criteria , purposing at the same time an alternative approach for this topic. SOFA criteria ( Sequential Organ<symptom> Failure<symptom> Assessment Score) are more complete , but too extensive and usually difficult to apply outside the intensive care units , therefore inducing potentially delay in the proper treatment. We purpose combined criteria for the selection of sepsis<disease> patients. Initially , we could apply qSOFA ( quick Sepsis<disease> Related Organ<symptom> Failure<symptom> Assessment) criteria , due to its easy application , associated with the SIRS ( systemic inflammatory response syndrome<disease>) criteria , allowing to select the patients who are infected and need faster treatment. In that way we would use the best of old and newest criteria , allowing the early selection of patients who are infected and require faster treatment , while the search for a better and faster tool continues.
