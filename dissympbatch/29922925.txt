  Assessing the efficacy of single high-intensity focused ultrasound ( HIFU) ablation in benign thyroid nodules<symptom> beyond 12 months. One hundred and eight patients underwent single HIFU treatment. Extent of nodule shrinkage ( by volume reduction ratio ( VRR)) and obstructive symptom score ( by 0-10 visual analogue scale ( VAS)) were evaluated for 24 months after treatment. VRR ( %) was calculated based on the formula: ( baseline volume- volume at visit)/ ( baseline volume) × 100. Binary logistic regression was performed to evaluate factors associated with 24-month treatment success ( VRR ≥ 50 %). After treatment , the mean ( ± SD) VRR at 3 , 6 , 12 ,18 and 24 months were 51.32 ± 20.71 % , 62.99 ± 22.05 % , 68.66 ± 18.48 % , 69.76 ± 17.88 % and 70.41 ± 17.39 % , respectively , while the median ( IQR) VAS at baseline , 6 , 12 and 24 months was gradually lowered from 4.0 ( 2.0) , 2.0 ( 1.0) , 2.0 ( 1.0) to 1.0 ( 2.0) , respectively. Sixty-three ( 58.3 %) nodules<symptom> had a further volume reduction ( i.e. > 4.5 %) from 12 to 24 months , while 22 ( 20.4 %) nodules<symptom> had a volume increase of > 4.5 % from 12 to 24 months. Small pre-ablation nodule<disease> volume was a significant determinant for treatment success at 24 months ( OR = 1.045 , 95 % CI = 1.021-1.092 , p = 0.038). A majority of nodules<symptom> had further volume reduction beyond 12 months after single HIFU ablation , but since one-fifth of nodules<symptom> had a notable volume increase beyond 12 months , a longer period of surveillance would be necessary. Small pre-ablation nodule<disease> volume was a significant factor determining 24-month treatment success. • Small but significant nodule<disease> shrinkage continues beyond 12 months after single treatment. • Obstructive symptom continues to improve beyond 12 months after single treatment • Smaller-sized nodules<symptom> have a greater chance of treatment success at 24 months.
