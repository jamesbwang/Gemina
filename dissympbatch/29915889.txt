  Although liposarcomas are the most common soft tissue sarcomas<disease> , their intracranial variants are extremely rare. Here , we present a case of a primary intracranial myxoid liposarcoma in a 23-year-old Japanese man who presented with generalized seizures<symptom> and a mass in the left frontal lobe. The tumor was totally removed , and histological analyses pointed to liposarcoma. Thirteen years after his initial treatment , the patient presented with right-side weakness<symptom> and local recurrence of tumor was discovered. Histology from the second resection confirmed the diagnosis of myxoid liposarcoma. Shortly after the second resection , progressive , new intracranial lesions<symptom> were observed and despite a third resection , extensive intracerebral invasion by the tumor proved fatal. The histological features of myxoid liposarcoma were essentially similar with each recurrence , but the aggressive tumor behavior after the second operation did not align with expectations based on histological classification.
