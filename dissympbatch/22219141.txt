  Synovitis<symptom> , acne , pustulosis , hyperostosis , and osteitis ( SAPHO) syndrome<disease> is an autoinflammatory disorder without standardized treatment. Janus kinase ( JAK) inhibitors can block a range of cytokines and might possess significant anti-inflammatory activity. Here , we report the first case of efficacious treatment of refractory SAPHO syndrome<disease> with the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib. A 44-year-old woman presented with arthralgia in the right wrist and complained of having difficulty in doing housework. Symptoms were unresponsiveness to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs , and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor inhibitors. A diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome<disease> was made based on previous dermatological and osteoarticular manifestations and bone scintigraphy findings. Oral treatment with tofacitinib at 5 mg twice daily in combination with the basic methotrexate treatment was initiated. After 4 weeks of using tofacitinib , the patient reported marked improvement of symptoms and also reported being competent in completing housework. The efficacy of JAK inhibitors in treating refractory SAPHO syndrome<disease> should be noted.
