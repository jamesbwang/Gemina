  Patients exposed to long acting anticoagulant rodenticides ( LAARs) are typically administered large amounts of oral vitamin K1 ( VK1) to counteract life-threatening anti-coagulant effects. While VK1 treatment effectively prevents mortality , additional methods are needed to reduce the long duration of VK1 treatment which can last for months at high expense. We developed a model of brodifacoum ( BDF) poisoning<disease> , one of the most potent LAARs , in adult male New Zealand White ( NZW) rabbits. The LD50 for oral BDF was determined to be 192 Î¼g/kg , similar to that calculated for adult rats. However , in contrast to rats , NZW rabbits exhibited severe internal hemorrhage<symptom> including in the brain , symptoms which mimic what occurs in cases of human poisoning<disease>. Similar to warfarin , BDF and other LAARs undergo enterohepatic recirculation which contributes to their long half-lives. We therefore tested effects of cholestyramine ( CSA) , an FDA-approved bile sequestrant , on BDF-induced mortality. When given daily ( 0.67 gm/kg , oral) starting the day of BDF administration , CSA reduced mortality from 67 % to 11 %. At the same CSA prevented the increase in clotting time , and reduced the decrease in core body temperature due to BDF. Given its excellent safety record and that it is approved for children older than 6 years , these findings suggest CSA could be considered as an adjunct to VK1 for treatment of LAAR
