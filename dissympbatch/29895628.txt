  A 37-year-old male presented with cough<symptom> , dyspnea<symptom> , significant weight<symptom> loss<symptom> ( 45 pounds) and subacute fever<disease> for the past two months. Physical examination revealed inspiratory and expiratory wheezing bilaterally. A normal S1 , S2 and a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper parasternal border with respiratory variation were found during cardiac auscultation. Kidney and bone<disease> marrow biopsy reported a high grade B cell lymphoma. Echocardiography and cardiac CT findings consisted of multiple intracardiac masses affecting the right ventricular ( RV) outflow track , RV apex , medial portion of the right atrium and posterior left atrium , as well as mild impairment of the RV systolic function. The masses in the RV outflow track caused partial obstruction ( Pulmonary Valve peak velocity 2.3 m/s) with a RV systolic pressure of 43 mmHg. The infiltrative mass in the interatrial septum extended into both the right and left atrial cavities. The right superior pulmonary vein was occluded. This patient was treated with aggressive chemotherapy and had a good clinical response that resulted in mass size reduction after the first course of chemotherapy. Multimodality imaging techniques such as echocardiography , cardiac CT and PET scan can provide complementary information to better evaluate , stage and manage these patients.
