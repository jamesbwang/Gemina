  This case report describes a rare presentation of presumed brain stem tuberculoma in a 28-year-old male who presented with acute onset of third cranial nerve palsy with contralateral hemiparesis<symptom> ( Weber syndrome<disease>) and upgaze palsy. Isolated midbrain tuberculoma is rare , presenting with varied clinical manifestations and radiological findings posing as a diagnostic dilemma. Weber syndrome<disease> is commonly caused by midbrain infarct secondary to occlusion of branches of the posterior cerebral artery and rarely from a tuberculoma. The patient is a case of disseminated tuberculosis<disease> with granuloma<disease> in midbrain causing pressure effect , thereby presenting with features consistent with Weber syndrome<disease> and upgaze palsy. The patient had good recovery with antitubercular treatment and systemic steroids.
