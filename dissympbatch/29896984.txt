  Cachexia has been recognized for a long time as an adverse effect of cancer. It is associated with reduced physical function , reduced tolerance to anticancer therapy , and reduced survival. This wasting syndrome<disease> is mainly known for an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle leading to progressive functional impairment and is driven by a variable combination of reduced food intake and abnormal metabolism. Cytokines derived from host immune system or the tumor itself is believed to play a role in promoting cancer cachexia. Circulating levels of cytokines , including IL-1α , IL-6 , and TNFα have been identified in cancer patients but they probably only represent a small part of a changed and abnormal metabolism. Murine models have shown that browning of white adipose tissue ( WAT) takes place early in the progression of cancer cachexia. Thus , browning of white adipose tissue is believed to be a strong contributor to the increased energy expenditure common in cachectic patients. Despite the severe implications of cancer cachexia for the patients and extensive research efforts , a more coherent and mechanistic explanation of the syndrome<disease> is lacking , and for many clinicians , cancer cachexia is still a vague concept. From a lung cancer perspective this commentary reviews the current knowledge on cancer cachexia mechanisms and identifies specific ways of clinical management regarding food intake , systemic inflammation<symptom> , and muscular dysfunction. Much of what we know comes from preclinical studies. More translational research is needed for a future cancer cachexia screening tool to guide clinicians , and here possible variables for a cancer cachexia screening tool are considered.
