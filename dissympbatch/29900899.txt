  Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis ( ABPA) is underdiagnosed and underevaluated routinely because of clinical and radiological overlap with tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) , especially in tropical setting with high TB burden countries like India. ABPA is the best-recognized manifestation of Aspergillus-associated hypersensitivity<disease> to Aspergillus antigens in patients with long-standing atopic asthma. ABPA with varied clinical presentation has been reported to occur in 20 % of asthmatic patients admitted to hospitals and in 5 % of all rhinitis cases. In this case report , we documented middle age male with known asthma case for many years with constitutional symptoms such as cough<symptom> , fever<disease> , and shortness of breath diagnosed as TB and received anti-TB treatment for 4 weeks. Finally , we confirmed as a case of ABPA and documented complete clinical and radiological response to medical treatment with antifungals and systemic corticosteroids.
