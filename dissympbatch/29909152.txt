  Noninfectious fevers<symptom> are common early after T cell-replete HLA haploidentical ( haplo) peripheral blood transplants and have been associated with cytokine release syndrome<disease> and overall mortality. However , less is known regarding the incidence and associations of early fever<disease> after bone<disease> marrow transplantation ( BMT) with post-transplant cyclophosphamide ( PTCy). We hypothesized that early fever<disease> would be associated with myeloablative conditioning ( MAC) , because of its relative increase in tissue damage augmenting antigen presentation and class II HLA-mismatching because of recognition of antigen-presenting cells by CD4
