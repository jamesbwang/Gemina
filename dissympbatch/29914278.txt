  To assess the relation between maternal , fetal and neonatal outcomes and different forms of hypertensive disorders associating pregnancy in women needed intensive care units ( ICU) admission. A prospective case control study conducted on 1238 women admitted to hypertensive intensive care unit at three university hospitals. They were classified into four groups. Group I included 472 women with severe preeclampsia ( PE) , Group II included 243 women with eclampsia ( E); Group III included 396 women diagnosed with E associated with HELLP syndrome<disease> and Group IV included 127 women diagnosed as HELLP syndrome<disease>. All women received magnesium sulfate to prevent and/or control convulsions<symptom> and nifedipine to control their blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. Primary outcome parameter was maternal mortality. Other outcomes included maternal morbidities , fetal and neonatal outcome. There was a significant difference among the study groups regarding the need for blood transfusion ( 58.1 , 70 , 84.3 and 42.5 % respectively , p < 0.001) , Number of transferred units ( 2.4 ± 1 , 2.9 ± 0.9 , 3.4 ± 1.1 and 3.5 ± 0.8 respectively , p < 0.001) , placental abruption ( 23.3 , 16.5 , 30.3 and 19.7 % respectively , p < 0.001) , Pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> ( 14.8 , 22.6 , 19.9 and 34.6 % respectively , p < 0.001) , Multiple complications ( 12.5 , 12,3 , 19.9 and 26 % respectively , p < 0.001) and Maternal Mortality ( 1.9 , 4.1,6.1 and 5.5 % respectively , p < 0.001). Regarding fetal and neonatal outcome , there was a significant difference among the 4 groups regarding Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes , Neonatal birth weight , NICU admission , NICU admission days , IUGR , Perinatal death , RDS , IVH , Sepsis<disease> and the need for Mechanical Ventilation ( p < 0.001). Higher rate of vaginal delivery was reported in women with HELLP ( 40.9 %) and severe PE ( 39.8 %) and higher rates of performing CS in women with eclampsia ( 77.8 %). Maternal mortality is significantly related to delivery with CS , younger maternal age with lower parity and the presence of placental abruption or pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom>. For groups 3,4 , which included HELLP cases , there are significant differences between both groups as regard HELLP classes according to Mississibi classification , also significant differences were seen between both groups as regard , materanal mortality , abruptio placenta , pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> , multiple organ damage , NICU admission , perinatal deaths and need for mechanical ventilation. Both maternal mortality and morbidity ( placental abruption , need for blood transfusion) are significantly higher in women with HELLP syndrome<disease> worsens to become class 1 regardless of whether eclampsia is present or not.
