  Patients with cancer who develop sepsis<disease> have a markedly higher mortality than patients who were healthy prior to the onset of sepsis<disease>. Potential mechanisms underlying this difference have previously been examined in two preclinical models of cancer followed by sepsis<disease>. Both pancreatic cancer/pneumonia and lung cancer/cecal ligation and puncture ( CLP) increase murine mortality , associated with alterations in lymphocyte<symptom> apoptosis and intestinal integrity. However , pancreatic cancer/pneumonia decreases lymphocyte<symptom> apoptosis and increases gut apoptosis while lung cancer/CLP increases lymphocyte<symptom> apoptosis and decreases intestinal proliferation. These results can not distinguish the individual roles of cancer versus sepsis<disease> since different models of each were used. We therefore created a new cancer/sepsis model to standardize each variable. Mice were injected with a pancreatic cancer cell line and three weeks later cancer mice and healthy mice were subjected to CLP. Cancer septic mice had a significantly higher 10-day mortality than previously healthy septic mice. Cancer septic mice had increased CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells , associated with decreased CD4 T cell apoptosis 24 hours after CLP. Further , splenic CD8 + T cell activation was decreased in cancer septic mice. In contrast , no differences were noted in intestinal apoptosis , proliferation or permeability , nor were changes noted in local bacterial burden , renal , liver or pulmonary injury. Cancer septic mice thus have consistently reduced survival compared to previously healthy septic mice , independent of the cancer or sepsis<disease> model utilized. Changes in lymphocyte<symptom> apoptosis are common to cancer model and independent of sepsis<disease> model whereas gut apoptosis is common to sepsis<disease> model and independent of cancer model. The host response to the combination of cancer and sepsis<disease> is dependent , at least in part , on both chronic co-morbidity and acute illness.
