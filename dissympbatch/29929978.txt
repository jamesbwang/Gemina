  Toll-like receptors ( TLRs) are a family of pattern-recognition receptors involved in innate immunity. Previous studies have shown that TLR2 inhibition protects the heart from acute stress , including myocardial infarction and doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in animal models. However , the role of TLR2 in the development of aging-associated heart<symptom> failure<symptom> is not known. In this work , we studied aging-associated changes in structure and function of TLR2- deficient mice hearts. Whereas young TLR2-KO mice did not develop marked cardiac dysfunction , 8- and 12-months-old TLR2-KO mice exhibited spontaneous adverse cardiac remodeling and cardiac dysfunction in an age-dependent manner. The hearts of the 8-months-old TLR2-KO mice had increased fibrosis<disease> , cell death , and reactivation of fetal genes. Moreover , TLR2-KO hearts displayed reduced infiltration by macrophages , increased numbers of myofibroblasts and atrophic cardiomyocytes , and higher levels of the atrophy-related ubiquitin ligases MuRF-1 and Atrogin-1. Mechanistically , TLR2-deficiency impaired the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway , leading to hyperactivation of the transcription factor forkhead box protein O1 ( FoxO1) , and , in turn , to elevated expression of FoxO target genes involved in regulation of muscle wasting and cell death. AS1842856-mediated chemical inhibition of FoxO1 reduced the expression of the atrophy-related ubiquitin ligases and significantly reversed the adverse cardiac remodeling , while improving the contractile functions in the TLR2-KO mice. Interestingly , TLR2 levels decreased in hearts of older mice , and activation of TLR1/2 signaling improved cardiac functions in these mice. These findings suggest that TLR2 signaling is essential for protecting the heart against aging-associated adverse remodeling and contractile dysfunction in mice.
