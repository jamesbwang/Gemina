  Macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF) is an important cytokine for which an increasing number of functions is being described in the pathogenesis of inflammation<symptom> and cancer. Nevertheless , the availability of potent and druglike MIF inhibitors that are well-characterized in relevant disease models remains limited. Highly potent and selective small-molecule MIF inhibitors and validation of their use in relevant disease models will advance drug discovery. In this review , we provide an overview of recent advances in the identification of MIF as a pharmacological target in the pathogenesis of inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> and cancer. We also give an overview of the current developments in the discovery and design of small-molecule MIF inhibitors and define future aims in this field.
