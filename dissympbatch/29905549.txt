  20 % of trauma deaths occur late after the injury. It is usually the result of sepsis<disease> , multi-system organ<symptom> failure<symptom> , or other complications. In Polytrauma induced sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom> patients , antibacterial management is crucial. The knowledge of recent aspects of treatment is decreasing the costs and the resistance of pathogens , morbidity and mortality. Different models of treatment are suggested by authors , basically they are depended on: the patients age , there health condition , the factors of immunodeficiency , at the location of infection and others. Using the key words , the search engines produced articles. The review was made on the studies about Polytrauma induced sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom> patients , about their antimicrobial treatment dosage and duration , about the source control and about the methods of early identification of pathogens ( Bacteria and Candida). The advantages and disadvantages of early identification were also studied. Also the role if biomarkers were also reviewed. Based on the review , recommendations are given about the recent principles of antibacterial treatment of Polytrauma induced sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom> patients.
