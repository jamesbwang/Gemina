  Cannabinoid receptors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha ( PPAR-α) are gaining recognition as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of skin disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of cannabinoid type 1 and 2 receptors ( CBR1 and CBR2) and PPAR-α in feline skin and verify whether changes occur in the course of hypersensitivity<disease> dermatitis<disease>. Twelve privately owned cats. Skin samples were obtained from five healthy cats with no skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> and seven cats clinically diagnosed with hypersensitivity<disease> dermatitis<disease>. Haematoxylin and eosin stained skin sections were investigated for histopathological changes. Indirect immunofluorescence for CBR1 , CBR2 and PPAR-α was performed on paraffin-embedded sections , and antibody specificity tested by Western blot analysis. Skin samples from cats with hypersensitivity<disease> dermatitis<disease> were all histopathologically diagnosed with eosinophilic dermatitis<disease>. CB receptors and PPAR-α were distributed throughout the skin in both healthy and allergic cats. In normal feline skin , these receptors were mainly distributed in the epithelial compartment. Receptor expression increased in hypersensitivity<disease> compared to healthy skin , with the main distribution changes being suprabasal for CBR1 , dermal for CBR2 and marked expression of PPAR-α in hyperplastic epidermis and perivascular infiltrate. Increased expression of cannabinoid receptors in the skin of cats with hypersensitivity<disease> dermatitis<disease> suggests an endogenous protective strategy and may support the use of natural cannabinoid receptor or PPAR-α agonists to treat feline
