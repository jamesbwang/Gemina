  None In this study , which was conducted on 660 samples , a 2- step strategy was used. In the first step , glutamate dehydrogenase ( GDH) was detected in stool<symptom> samples by enzyme-linked immunofluorescent assay ( ELFA). In the second step , GDH positive samples were tested for Of the 660 samples screened , toxin was detected in 8.8 % ( 58/660) by ELFA and 9.7 % ( 64/660) by NAAT. GDH was detected in 23.8 % ( 157/660) and toxin in 36.9 % ( 58/157) of the GDH positives. Most of the toxin positive patients were on one or more antibiotics prior to developing diarrhoea<disease> The implicated antibiotics were meropenem , amikacin , colistin and cephalosporins. Diabetes , hypertension , use of proton pump inhibitors , previous hospitalization , malignancy and chemotherapy were found to be the risk factors in our study. Prevalence of GDH was 23.8 % ( 157/660) by ELFA. Toxin prevalence was 9.7 % ( 64/660). Detection rates of
