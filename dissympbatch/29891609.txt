  Solithromycin is a novel fluoroketolide antibiotic which was under investigation for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia<disease> ( CABP). A phase 1 study was performed to characterize the pharmacokinetics ( PK) and safety of solithromycin in children. Eighty-four subjects ( median age , 6 years ( age range , 4 days to 17 years)) were administered intravenous ( i.v.) or oral ( capsules or suspension) solithromycin ( i.v. , 6 to 8 mg/kg of body<symptom> weight; capsules/suspension , 14 to 16 mg/kg on days 1 and 7 to 15 mg/kg on days 2 to 5). PK samples were collected after the first and multidose administration. Data from 83 subjects ( 662 samples) were combined with previously collected adolescent PK data (
