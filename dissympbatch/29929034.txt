  Cerebral cavernous malformations ( CCMs) are present in up to 0.5 % of the general population. While CCMs have been considered congenital lesions<symptom> , numerous reports have observed de novo formations in patients with the familial form of CCM and in patients after cranial radiotherapy. Outside of these circumstances , there is scant evidence as to the potential etiologies of CCM. We present a 48-year-old woman with a medical history of endometrial hyperplasia<disease> concomitant endometrial polyps demonstrating a large de novo CCM , which grew to a large size in a period of 20 months. A previous MRI showed no abnormalities. This CCM exhibited aggressive biological behavior characterized by recurrent overt bleeding and seizure<symptom>. Histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of CCM. Here , we discuss the growth mechanisms of these lesions<symptom>. Given the patient 's medical history and imaging findings , we propose that de novo CCMs can arise directly from angiogenic proliferation , secondary to BCL-2 overexpression from underlying causes. We hypothesize that inappropriate secretion of estrogen could have set off a genetic cascade with attendant endothelial proliferation. Thus , female hormones may play an important role in influencing the biological behavior of CCMs. The relationship between estrogen and CCM needs further investigation.
