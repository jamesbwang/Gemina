  Aging is characterised by a gradual loss of the functional reserve. This , along with the fostering of sedentary habits and the increase in risk factors , causes a deterioration of antioxidant defences and an increase of the circulatory levels of inflammatory and oxidative markers , boosting a low-rate chronic inflammation<symptom> , defined as inflamm-aging. This phenomenon is present in the aetiopathology of chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , as well as in cognitive deterioration cases associated with aging. The objective of this review is to describe the modulation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of physical exercise of moderate intensity and volume in the elderly. Evidence of its effectiveness as a non-pharmacological resource is presented , which decreases some deleterious effects of aging. This is mainly due to its neuroprotective action , the increase in circulating anti-inflammatory markers , and the improvement of antioxidant defence derived from its practice.
