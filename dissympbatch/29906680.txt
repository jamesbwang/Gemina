  Updated multi-institutional database studies assessing perioperative risk factors on 30-day morbidity and mortality after skull base surgeries are limited. We aim to identify perioperative risk factors and report the incidence of 30-day morbidity and mortality in adult patients after skull base surgery. We queried the 2007-2016 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement program database to identify patients who underwent anterior , middle , or posterior skull base surgery. We performed multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with 30-day morbidity and mortality. Postoperative events were compared between propensity score matched cohorts ( no morbidity versus 30-day morbidity). The final analysis included 1028 adult ( ≥ 18 years old) patients. The incidence of 30-morbidity and mortality was 14.6 % and 1.6 % , respectively. Postoperative ventilator dependence ( 52.9 %) followed by pneumonia<disease> ( 23.5 %) and unplanned intubation ( 23.5 %) had the highest prevalence among those with 30-day mortality. The adjusted odds of 30-day morbidity was significantly higher among patients with functional dependency , American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status ≥ 4 , hyponatremia , and anemia<symptom> ( p < 0.05). The adjusted odds of 30-day mortality was significantly increased among patients with sepsis<disease> , bleeding disorder , disseminated cancer , and older age ( p < 0.05). Clinical perioperative factors are significantly associated with 30-day morbidity and mortality after skull base surgery. The reported rate of 30-day morbidity and mortality was similar to earlier studies and therefore highlights the need for continued quality improvement.
