  This study measured patient outcomes among symptomatic patients with superficial chronic venous insufficiency who were treated with retrograde ultrasound-guided polidocanol microfoam 1 % in a community setting. Between March 2015 and June 2017 , 250 symptomatic patients with C2-C6 chronic venous insufficiency received polidocanol microfoam 1 % and were followed for 16 ± 7 months. Sixteen of the 250 patients ( 6.4 %) had skin<symptom> ulcers<disease> , and 56 ( 22.4 %) were treated previously with thermal or surgical interventions. All patients underwent a duplex ultrasound venous incompetence study to map perforators and veins to be treated. Incompetent veins were accessed with a micropuncture needle distal to the midthigh perforator , approximately 10 cm above the knee fold. The leg was then elevated 45 °. Under ultrasound guidance , the incompetent greater saphenous vein was closed with polidocanol microfoam 1 %. A second injection was administered through the same catheter directing the microfoam to flow in a retrograde fashion through the incompetent venous valves to the ankle. All patients completed the initial treatment; 55 ( 22.0 %) required planned secondary treatment during the follow-up period for residual venous reflux in the below-knee greater saphenous vein. Complete elimination of venous valvular reflux and symptom improvement was documented in 236 patients ( 94.4 %). Minor adverse events included asymptomatic deep vein thrombi ( n = 2) , common femoral vein thrombus extension ( n = 1) , and superficial venous thrombi ( n = 4). Of the 16 patients with skin<symptom> ulcers<disease> , 10 were C6 patients and 80 % experienced wound<disease> closure within 4 weeks of treatment. Retrograde administration of polidocanol microfoam 1 % is a safe and effective treatment with important clinical benefit for superficial venous insufficiency in community practice.
