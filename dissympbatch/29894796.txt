  As antibiotics predispose travelers to acquiring multidrug-resistant intestinal bacteria , they should no longer be considered a mainstay for treating travelers ' diarrhea<disease> It has been claimed that stand-by antibiotics are justified as a means to avoid visits to local healthcare providers which often lead to polypharmacy. We revisited the traveler data of 316 prospectively recruited volunteers with travelers ' diarrhea<disease> by retrieving from questionnaires and health diaries information on antibiotic use , stand-by antibiotic carriage , and visits with local healthcare. Multivariable analysis was applied to identify factors associated with antibiotic use. Among our 316 volunteers with travelers ' diarrhea<disease> , however , carrying stand-by antibiotics seemed not to reduce the rate of healthcare-seeking; on the contrary , antibiotic use was more frequent among stand-by antibiotic carriers ( 34 %) than non-carriers ( 11 %). Antibiotics were equally taken for severe and incapacitating travelers ' diarrhea<disease> , but compared to non-carriers , stand-by antibiotic carriers resorted to medication also for mild/moderate ( 38 % vs. 4 %) and non-incapacitating disease ( 29 % vs. 5 %). Antibiotic use was associated with stand-by antibiotic carriage ( OR 7.2; 95 % CI 2.8-18.8) , vomiting<symptom> ( OR 3.5; 95 % CI 1.3-9.5) , incapacitating diarrhea<disease> ( OR 3.6; 95 % CI 1.3-9.8) , age ( OR 1.03; 95 % CI 1.00-1.05) , and healthcare visit for diarrhea<disease> ( OR 465.3; 95 % CI 22.5-9633.6). Carriage of stand-by antibiotics encouraged less cautious use of antibiotics. Recommendations involving prescription of antibiotics for all travelers require urgent revision.
