  Cardiac surgery of the newborn and infant with complex congenital heart disease ( CHD) is associated with a high rate of intraoperative bleeding complications. CHD-related anatomic features such as valve stenoses or patent arterial ducts can lead to enhanced shear stress in blood stream and thus cause acquired von Willebrand syndrome<disease> ( aVWS). To evaluate the intraoperative incidence and impact of aVWS after cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB) in neonates and infants with complex CHD. We conducted a survey of patients aged < 12 months undergoing complex cardiac surgery in our tertiary referral center. Twelve patients , whose blood samples were analyzed for aVWS before CPB and immediately after discontinuation of CPB on a routine basis , were eligible for the analysis. Von Willebrand factor antigen ( VWF: Ag) , ristocetin cofactor activity ( VWF: RCo) , collagen binding activity ( VWF: CB) , VWF: multimers and factor VIII activity ( FVIII: C) were determined. aVWS was diagnosed by VWF multimer analysis in 10 out of 12 patients ( 83 %) prior to surgery and intraoperatively at the end of CPB in 8 out of 12 patients ( 66 %). Ten patients received VWF/FVIII-concentrate intraoperatively as individual treatment attempts during uncontrolled bleeding. They tolerated it well without intraoperative thrombotic events. One patient suffered a transient postoperative cerebral sinuous vein thrombosis. aVWS is of underestimated incidence in complex CHD surgery. These data may offer a new approach to reduce the risk for severe<symptom> bleedings<symptom> and to achieve haemostasis during high risk pediatric cardiac surgery by tailoring the substitution of von Willebrand factor concentrate.
