  Fever<disease> remains a major public health problem. In Burkina Faso , more than half of febrile children are considered not to be infected by malaria<disease> This study prospectively assessed probable ( treatable) causes of fever<disease> in Burkinabe children. A prospective study was conducted among febrile children ( ≥ 37.5 °C) under 5 years of age presenting at four health facilities and one referral hospital in rural Burkina Faso. From each participant , blood was collected for malaria<disease> microscopy and culture , urine for dipstick testing and culturing if tested positive for leucocytes and nitrite , stool<symptom> for rotavirus/adenovirus testing , culture and parasitology , and a nasopharyngeal swab for culture. In total 684 febrile children were included in the study. Plasmodium<disease> falciparum<disease> malaria<disease> was found in 49.7 % ( 340/684) of the participants and non-malaria infections in 49.1 % ( 336/684) of children. The non-nalaria infections included gastro-intestinal infections ( 37.0 %) , common bacterial pathogens of nasopharynx ( 24.3 %) , bacterial bloodstream infections ( 6.0 %) and urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> ( 1.8 %). Nearly 45 % ( 154/340) of the malaria<disease> infected children were co-infected with non-nalaria infections , but only 3.2 % ( 11/340) of these co-infections could be considered as a possible alternative cause of fever<disease> In contrast , in the malaria<disease> microscopy negative children 18.0 % ( 62/344) of the infections could be the probable cause of the fever<disease> Pathogens were not isolated from 23.7 % ( 162/684) of the febrile cases. Malaria<disease> remains the most common pathogen found in febrile children in Burkina Faso. However , a relative high number of febrile children had non-malaria infections. The correct diagnosis of these non-malaria fevers<symptom> is a major concern , and there is an urgent need to develop more point-of-care diagnostic tests and capacities to identify and treat the causes of these
