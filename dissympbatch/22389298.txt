  Unlike western world , gallstones and hypertriglyceridemia ( HTG) are among the first two etiologies of acute pancreatitis<disease> ( AP) in China. But yet , detailed differences in clinical features and outcomes between hypertriglyceridemia and biliary acute pancreatitis<disease> have not been well described. This retrospective study enrolled 730 acute pancreatitis<disease> patients from July 1 , 2013 to October 1 , 2016 in Jinling Hospital. The causes of the study patients were defined according to specific diagnostic criteria. The clinical features and outcomes of patients with hypertriglyceridemia acute pancreatitis<disease> ( HTG-AP) and biliary acute pancreatitis<disease> ( BAP) were compared in terms of general information , disease severity , laboratory data , system complications , local complications , and clinical outcome. In the enrolled 730 AP patients , 305 ( 41.8 %) were HTG-AP , and 425 ( 58.2 %) were BAP. Compared to BAP , the HTG-AP patients were found to be younger , with higher body mass Index ( BMI) , and much higher proportion of diabetes , fatty liver and high fat diet. Besides that , HTG-AP patients had significantly higher C-reactive protein ( CRP) ( p < 0.01) and creatinine ( p = 0.031) , together with more acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> ( ARDS) ( p = 0.039) , acute kidney injury ( AKI) ( p < 0.001) , deep venous thrombosis ( p = 0.008) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome<disease> ( MODS) ( p = 0.032) in systematic complications. As for local complications , HTG-AP patients had significantly less infected pancreatitis<disease> necrosis<symptom> ( p = 0.005). However , there was no difference in mortality , hospital duration and costs between the groups. HTG-AP patients were younger , more male , having high fat diet and with higher BMI compared to BAP patients. The prevalence of AKI/ARDS/DVT/ MODS in HTG-AP patients was higher than BAP patients , while BAP patients had a greater possibility in development of infected pancreatitis<disease> necrosis<symptom> ( IPN). According to the multivariate analysis , only the complication of AKI was independently related with the etiology of HTG , however , BMI contributes to AKI , ARDS and DVT.
