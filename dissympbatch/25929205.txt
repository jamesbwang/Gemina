  The aim of this study is to investigate the usefulness of flexion-extension ( dynamic) radiographs in evaluating the severity of disc degeneration and disc protrusion in cervical magnetic resonance image ( MRI). Patients complaining of neck or arm<symptom> pain<symptom> with no prior surgical history and who had undergone both cervical MRI and dynamic radiographs were included in this study. The following patients were excluded: those who had any history of trauma , autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis<disease> or ankylosing spondylitis , prior cervical fracture or prior cervical spine surgery. Based on these criteria , 161 patients who visited our department for neck<symptom> pain<symptom> or upper extremity radicular symptoms were initially included retrospectively. Among them , 69 patients were excluded due to the lack of cervical MRI or dynamic radiographs. Therefore , a total of 92 patients were included for analysis in this study. The maximal diameter of disc protrusion in sagittal or axial MRI , the severity of cervical disc degeneration , and segmental horizontal displacement in dynamic cervical radiographs are the main outcome measurements. In the results of this study , the extension radiograph of C5/6 had the highest sensitivity ( 93.33 %) and specificity ( 100 %) in predicting cervical disc protrusion followed by C4/5 ( sensitivity; 77.28 % , specificity 92.86 %) among the dynamic radiographs. Segmental horizontal displacement at the C3/4 , C4/5 , and C5/6 level in the neutral and extension radiographs had a significant correlation with the severity of cervical disc degeneration in MRI ( P < .05). At the C6/7 level , however , only extension radiograph had a significant correlation with the severity of cervical disc degeneration in the MRI ( P < .05). In conclusion , if MRI is not available in a primary clinical setting , dynamic cervical radiographs may be useful in predicting the severity of degenerative disc and disc protrusion in cervical MRI. Among the dynamic cervical radiographs , the extension radiograph was the most sensitive for predicting the severity of cervical disc degeneration and disc protrusion , especially at the C3/4 , C4/5 , C5/6 , and C6/7 levels in MRI.
