  Two adult sibling red-handed tamarins ( Saguinus midas) presented with weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and multifocal skin masses. A skin biopsy revealed pyogranulomatous dermatitis<disease> with intrafollicular Demodex sp. mites. Subsequent skin scrapes confirmed the presence of live mites within lesions<symptom>. Initial treatment with topical and oral ivermectin was unsuccessful , and lesions<symptom> continued to progress. A single dose of fluralaner ( Bravecto Â® , Merck Animal Health , Kenilworth , New Jersey , 07033 , USA; 28.125 mg po) was administered to each animal approximately 5 mo after initial presentation. Lesions<symptom> resolved over the next 3 mo , and all follow-up skin scrapes were negative for both animals. No adverse effects were noted. A single oral administration of fluralaner at 30-35 mg/kg appears adequate and safe for the treatment of generalized demodicosis in red-handed tamarins.
