  Tributyltin chloride ( TBT) is an obesogen associated with various metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions after in utero exposure. However , few studies have evaluated TBT 's obesogenic effect on adult ovaries. In this study , we assessed whether TBT 's obesogenic effects resulted in adult ovarian adipogenesis and other reproductive abnormalities. TBT was administered to adult female Wistar rats , and their reproductive tract morphophysiology was assessed. We further assessed the ovarian mRNA/protein expression of genes that regulate adipogenesis. Rats exposed to TBT displayed abnormal estrous cyclicity , ovarian sex hormone levels , ovarian follicular development and ovarian steroidogenic enzyme regulation. Rats exposed to TBT also demonstrated abnormal ovarian adipogenesis with increased cholesterol levels , lipid accumulation , and PPARγ , C/EBP-β and Lipin-1 expression. A negative correlation between the ovarian PPARγ expression and aromatase expression was observed in the TBT rats. Furthermore , TBT exposure resulted in reproductive tract atrophy , inflammation<symptom> , oxidative stress and fibrosis<disease>. Ovarian dysfunctions also co-occurred with the uterine irregularities. Abnormal ovarian adipogenic markers occurring after TBT exposure may be associated with uterine irregularities. A positive correlation between the ovarian cholesterol levels and uterine inflammation<symptom> was observed in the TBT rats. These findings suggest that TBT leads to ovarian obesogenic effects directly by abnormal adipogenesis and/or indirectly through adult reproductive tract irregularities.
