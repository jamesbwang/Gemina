  Neonatal seizures<symptom> represent a significant health burden on the term and preterm neonatal population and are linked to poor long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Currently , there are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved antiepileptic drugs for neonates , and authors of the medical literature have yet to reach a consensus on the most adequate approach to neonatal seizures<symptom>. Topiramate is readily used in the adult and older pediatric population for the management of migraines and partial-onset seizures<symptom>. Topiramate continues to gain favor among pediatric neurologists who often recommend this medication as a third-line treatment of neonatal seizures<symptom>. We report our recent experience with 4 preterm neonates , born between 2015 and 2017 , who developed radiographic signs of necrotizing enterocolitis<disease> after receiving topiramate for seizures<symptom>. Each was given oral topiramate for the treatment of electrographic and clinical seizures<symptom> and developed the subsequent diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis<disease> , with abdominal<symptom> distention<symptom> , hemoccult-positive stools<symptom> , and radiographic signs of intestinal distention<symptom> and pneumatosis. More research regarding the risk factors of topiramate use in premature infants is needed.
