  Despite reports of pulmonary toxicity due to styrene , guidelines on acceptable styrene exposure levels have been based on risk of cancer and central nervous system and liver toxicity and not on respiratory effects. Many reports have linked exposure to styrene vapor in occupational settings to various forms of non-malignant pulmonary disorders including bronchiolitis<disease> , hypersensitivity<disease> pneumonitis<disease> , and occupational asthma. We report two cases in which the same tasks performed in a single workplace resulted in exposure to styrene vapor with subsequent development of acute<disease> respiratory<symptom> symptoms<symptom> associated with impaired gas exchange and imaging and histopathologic findings consistent with bronchiolitis<disease> and organizing pneumonia<disease> Both patients gradually recovered once their workplace exposure to styrene was terminated. Clinicians , employers , and insurers should be aware of the potential for pulmonary toxicity from exposure to styrene.
