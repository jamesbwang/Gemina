  Oncologic treatments may lead to the development of paronychia<disease> , which may cause severe<symptom> pain<symptom> and disability. However , a detailed objective scoring system is lacking. To develop an objective scoring system to quantify the severity of paronychia<disease> and also examine the correlation of this score with a pain index and patients ' quality of life. A novel scoring system for paronychia<disease> related to oncologic treatments ( SPOT) , consisting of four parameters , namely redness , oedema , discharge and granulation tissue , was designed to assess the severity of paronychia<disease> The visual analogue scale ( VAS) and Dermatology Quality of Life Index ( DLQI) were recorded , and their association with the SPOT scores was analysed. Ninety patients were enrolled from three medical centres in Taiwan. Severity of paronychia<disease> was determined by the scores of SPOT. Patients in the severe group had higher DLQI scores ( severe vs. mild: P = 0.0018; severe vs. moderate: P = 0.0015). Both the DLQI and pain index scores were significantly higher in patients with higher dominant hand SPOT scores. The SPOT scores demonstrated the association of the paronychia<disease> severity with DLQI and pain. It may thus be useful in clinical practice and future studies.
