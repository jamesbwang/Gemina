  Melittin , a major component of bee venom , is a water-soluble toxic peptide of which a various biological effects have been identified to be useful in anti-tumor therapy. In addition , Melittin also has anti-parasitic , anti-bacterial , anti-viral , and anti-inflammatory activities. Therefore , it is a very attractive therapeutic candidate for human<disease> diseases<disease>. However , melittin induces extensive hemolysis<symptom> , a severe side effect that dampens its future development and clinical application. Thus , studies of melittin derivatives and new drug delivery systems have been conducted to explore approaches for optimizing the efficacy of this compound , while reducing its toxicity. A number of reviews have focused on each side , respectively. In this review , we summarize the research progress on the anti-tumor effects of melittin and its derivatives , and discuss its future potential clinical applications.
