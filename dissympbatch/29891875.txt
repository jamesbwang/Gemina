  Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome<disease> represents about 10-20 % of pediatrics ' nephrotic syndrome<disease>. The regeneration of glomerular barrier seems pivotal for cessation of proteinuria<symptom>. Nephronectin ( NPNT) plays a major role in nephrogenesis , signal transduction , and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. This study aims to preliminary assess NPNT as potential noninvasive biomarker of glomerular regeneration and its ability to identify steroid resistance. In this case control study , 80 retrospectively selected patients with nephrotic syndrome<disease> were enrolled in addition to 40 healthy controls. Forty patients were steroid sensitive ( SSNS) and the other 40 patients were steroid-resistant ( SRNS) , NPTN concentration was measured using ELISA and NPNT mRNA expression was assayed using real-time PCR. NPTN concentrations were significantly higher in SSNS than both SRNS and controls ( The means were 4.64 ± 3.05 , 0.69 ± 0.44 , and 1.63 ± 0.59 , respectively). Moreover , NPTN concentrations were significantly lower in SRNS than controls. NPTN was significantly overexpressed in SSNS compared to both SRNS and controls ( the means were 10.82 ± 7.39 , 1.19 ± 0.94 , and 1.04 ± 0.10 , respectively) with no statistically significant difference between SRNS and controls. ROC curves analysis showed that both NPNT expression and NPNT serum level are of promising diagnostic performance ( ROC
