  Several types of thoracic complications can be associated with severe acute pancreatitis<disease> Some are very common , such as pleural effusion<symptom> , whilst some others are very rare although life threatening , such as enzymatic mediastinitis<disease> ( EM). Only a few cases of EM ( when related to acute pancreatitis<disease> have been described in the literature. Here we describe the case of a 76-year-old female who developed acute<disease> respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> and atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> during the postoperative period after an open pancreatic necrosectomy , due to an EM episode. The mediastinal collection was drained by thoracotomy , following an improvement of the patient 's general condition. This is the first case of EM following surgical management for acute necrotizing pancreatitis<disease> EM is a rare but life threatening complication that usually requires surgery.
