  Although the role of jumping ability in female volleyball players is well recognised , the effect of fatigue<symptom> on this ability is not well known. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a series of block jumps ( BJ) on jumping ability and whether it varies by performance level. Ten elite ( EG) and 11 amateur ( AG) female volleyball players performed a fatigue<symptom> intervention consisting of 45 BJ , being tested for squat jump ( SJ) , countermovement jump ( CMJ) and BJ before and after the intervention. Elasticity index ( EI): ( 100 × ( CMJ- SJ)/ SJ) and upper limbs coordination index ( ULCI<disease>): ( 100 × ( BJ- CMJ)/ CMJ) were calculated. After the intervention , EG showed a decrease of 4.40 % in BJ height (
