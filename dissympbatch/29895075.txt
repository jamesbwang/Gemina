  Primary aldosteronism ( PA) is an increasingly identified cause of secondary hypertension. PA can be caused by an aldosterone-producing adenoma or by bilateral adrenal hyperplasia<disease> , generally treated by adrenalectomy or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists , respectively. Recent studies suggest that PA is associated with more psychological symptoms and lower levels of well-being. The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations between subtype of PA and psychological symptoms and well-being after specific treatment. We analyzed the outcomes of the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form and the Symptom Checklist in 160 patients ( mean age 57 years; 74.3 % males) with PA , comparing the scores for psychological symptoms and well-being between both subtypes of PA.. Additionally , we performed subgroup analyses based on gender , age , time since initiation of treatment , and co-morbidity. Moreover , we compared the results with published norm scores. Mean follow-up after adrenalectomy or start of medication was four years and two months. Depressive symptoms , anxiety<symptom> and obsessive-compulsive thoughts and well-being did not differ between subtypes of PA.. Subgroup analysis did not reveal any differences , except for women with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia<disease> who scored higher on the anxiety<symptom> subscale than women after adrenalectomy. Compared to the general population , patients with treated PA reported more psychological symptoms. In contrast , well-being did not differ significantly from norm scores. Subtype and treatment of PA were no important determinants of psychological symptoms and well-being on the long-term. We suggest that physicians should be alert for psychological symptoms , as these were more frequently present in patients with PA..
