  To improve the detection of peritumoral changes in GBM patients by exploring the relation between MRSI information and the distance to the solid tumor volume ( STV) defined using structural MRI ( sMRI). Twenty-three MRSI studies ( PRESS , TE 135 ms) acquired from different patients with untreated GBM were used in this study. For each MRSI examination , the STV was identified by segmenting the corresponding sMRI images using BraTumIA , an automatic segmentation method. The relation between different metabolite ratios and the distance to STV was analyzed. A regression forest<disease> was trained to predict the distance from each voxel to STV based on 14 metabolite ratios. Then , the trained model was used to determine the expected distance to tumor ( EDT) for each voxel of the MRSI test data. EDT maps were compared against sMRI segmentation. The features showing abnormal values at the longest distances to the tumor were: % NAA , Glx/NAA , Cho/NAA , and Cho/Cr. These four features were also the most important for the prediction of the distances to STV. Each EDT value was associated with a specific metabolic pattern , ranging from normal brain tissue to actively proliferating tumor and necrosis<symptom>. Low EDT values were highly associated with malignant features such as elevated Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr. The proposed method enables the automatic detection of metabolic patterns associated with different distances to the STV border and may assist tumor delineation of infiltrative brain tumors such as GBM.
