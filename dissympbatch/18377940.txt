  Providing safe drinking-water to human civilization is indispensable; it is one of the most cost-effective means of reducing the disease burden of diarrhea<disease> Unfortunately , water supply quality monitoring from public water treatment plants ( WTPs) is often neglected or taken for granted. To determine the produced water quality , WTPs in Sarawak , Malaysia were assessed for their protozoa removal ability. A self-administered questionnaire based on the regulations in the Drinking-water Standards for New Zealand ( DWSNZ) was developed. Optional 10-liter raw water samples were collected from willing WTPs for the detection of protozoan cysts<symptom>. Routine physical and microbial testing of WTP parameters were also requested for raw water quality overview. Two of the nine assessed WTPs achieved three log credits in the treatment component , one of which belonged to Peninsular Malaysia. No log credits were obtained in the other tested components for any samples. Most of the WTPs employed `` Coagulation , Sedimentation , and Filtration '' using rapid gravity filters without enhancement (
