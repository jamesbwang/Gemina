  Perioperative use of cefazolin has been associated with severe allergic reactions , and patients are usually labelled as allergic to penicillin afterwards. The aim of our study was to describe a group of patients with immediate reactions to cefazolin , with proven selective hypersensitivity<disease> reactions. Systematic review of all patients followed at our drug centre with cefazolin-related reactions , between January 2012 and December 2016. All patients were investigated according to the European Network for Drug Allergy ( ENDA) recommendations through skin testing ( major and minor penicillin determinants , penicillin , amoxicillin , cefazolin , cefuroxime and ceftriaxone) and oral challenges tests. We included 7 patients ( median age 40 years) with perioperative anaphylactic reactions immediately after cefazolin injection , 4 with hypotension<symptom> and 1 with Kounis syndrome<disease> ( KS) type I. The presence of a selective IgE-mediated hypersensitivity<disease> through positive skin tests to cefazoline has been proven in all patients. Two patients experienced systemic reactions during skin testing. All patients were successfully challenged with amoxicillin , and they tolerated cefuroxime. Cefazolin can be responsible for immediate severe allergic reactions in perioperative setting , including KS. Allergological workup is essential for an accurate diagnosis and to explore cross-reactivity between cefazolin and other beta-lactams. Our experience confirmed that patients with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity<disease> reactions to cefazolin can tolerate other beta-lactams. This selective pattern of clinical reactivity may be explained by its particular chemical structure , whose R1 side-chain is different from other beta-lactams.
