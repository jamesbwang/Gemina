  Chronic<disease> otitis<disease> media<disease> with effusion<symptom> ( COME) is characterized by persistent middle ear effusions<symptom> that are in most cases highly viscous , but some patients present with serous fluid. This study aimed at comprehensively characterizing the macromolecular composition of mucoid vs. serous middle ear effusions<symptom> ( MEEs). MEEs from patients with COME were analyzed for proteins by mass spectrometry ( MS) and western blot techniques , total DNA quantity , bacterial DNA ( 16S sequencing) , and cytokine content. Proteomics datasets were studied in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( IPA). Mucoid samples showed a global tendency of increased pro-inflammatory mediators. Interleukin-1β ( IL-1β) and IL-10 were significantly more abundant in serous samples ( p < 0.01). Mucoid samples had higher DNA quantity ( p = 0.04) , more likely to be positive in MUC5B protein ( p = 0.008) and higher peptide counts ( 12,786 vs. 2225) , as well as an overall larger number of identified proteins ( 331 vs. 177) , compared to serous. IPA found the mucoid sample dataset to be related to immune cell function and epithelial remodeling , whereas the serous sample dataset showed acute responses and blood-related proteins. Interestingly , serous samples showed more bacterial DNA than mucoid ones , with less bacterial genera variability. This study demonstrates divergent immune responses in children with COME by effusion<symptom> quality.
