  Hippo signalling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that controls organ size by regulating cell proliferation , survival , apoptosis , and stem cell self-renewal. In addition , Hippo signalling is profoundly implicated in intestinal regeneration and cancer. However , its roles in the pathogenesis of Crohn 's disease ( CD) remain largely unexplored. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) was performed to identify the deregulated molecules in Hippo signalling. Expression of the highly upregulated Yes-associated protein 1 ( YAP) was subsequently examined by qRT-PCR , western blotting , and immunohistochemistry in the intestinal tissues of CD patients and the colons of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid ( TNBS)- induced colitis<disease> mice. The microRNAs ( miRNAs) predicted to target YAP were explored by transfection of miR-590-5p mimics or inhibitors and analyzed by luciferase reporter assay. The roles of the miR-590-5p/ YAP axis in CD and colorectal cancer were studied in experimental colitis<disease> mice and colorectal cancer cell lines. YAP mRNA was significantly upregulated in intestinal epithelial cells in CD patients and TNBS-induced colitis<disease> mice. MiR-590-5p suppressed YAP expression by directly targeting the YAP 3 '- untranslated region in Caco-2 cells and SW620 cells. Upregulation of miR-590-5p in colon reduced YAP level and its downstream targets in intestinal epithelial cells ( IECs). Treatment of miR-590-5p or YAP inhibitor Verteporfin alleviated experimental colitis<disease>. Targeting the miR-590-5p/ YAP axis inhibited cell proliferation and invasiveness of colorectal cancer ( CRC) cells in vitro. Our results suggest that miR-590-5p inhibits intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> in mouse colon and tumourigenesis of colorectal cancer cells by inhibiting YAP. The miR-590-5p/ YAP axis may be an important novel mechanism in the pathogenesis of CD and colorectal cancer.
