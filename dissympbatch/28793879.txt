  Although influenza<disease> may cause death in the geriatric population , the best method for predicting mortality in this population is still unclear. We retrospectively recruited older people ( ≥ 65 yr) with influenza<disease> visiting the emergency department ( ED) of a medical center between January 1 , 2010 , and December 31 , 2015. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify independent mortality predictors and then developed a prediction score. Four hundred nine older ED patients with a nearly equal sex ratio were recruited. Five independent mortality predictors were identified: severe<symptom> coma<symptom> ( Glasgow Coma<symptom> Scale score ≤ 8) , past histories of cancer and coronary artery disease , elevated C-reactive protein levels ( > 10 mg/dl) , and bandemia ( > 10 % band cells). We divided the patients into three mortality risk and disposition groups: ( 1) low risk ( 1.1 %; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.5-3.0 %); ( 2) moderate risk ( 16.7 %; 95 % CI , 9.3-28.0 %); and ( 3) high risk ( 40 %; 95 % CI , 19.8-64.2 %). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit of the GID score were 0.86 and 0.578 , respectively. The GID score is an efficient and simple tool for predicting mortality in older ED patients with influenza<disease> Further studies are warranted to validate its use.
