  Mycosis<disease> fungoides ( MF) is the most common form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Persistent antigenic stimulation has been claimed to play a role in the development of this malignancy. We aimed to show the role of sulfur mustard in the pathogenesis of MF. A 45-year-old man with MF is introduced herein. He was a victim of chemical exposure in 1987 during the Iran-Iraq war. He developed skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> 3 years after exposure to sulfur mustard gas at the age of 21. Seven years after his exposure to sulfur mustard gas , a biopsy from the posterior distal part of his calf , which was injured and had bulla , revealed MF. Later , he developed more lesions<symptom> on his extremities , trunk , and abdomen. On his previous admission , his left eyebrow was involved. A punch biopsy specimen was obtained from his eyebrow lesion<symptom> , which rendered diffuse infiltration of atypical lymphocyte<symptom> cells with some convoluted nuclei and scant cytoplasm admixed with lymphocytes , histiocytes , and mast cells compatible with the nodular stage of MF. At his last admission , a biopsy was obtained from the plaque lesions<symptom> on his left thigh , and a TCR-Î³ gene rearrangement of the paraffin block of the plaque lesions<symptom> revealed positive monoclonality. All the findings supported the MF diagnosis. We concluded that sulfur mustard could be a risk factor for MF development.
