  Ovarian carcinoma is not a single disease , but rather a collection of subtypes with differing molecular properties and risk profiles. The most common of these , and the subject of this work , is high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma ( HGSC). In this population-based study we identified a cohort of 441,382 women resident in Western Australia who had ever been admitted to hospital in the State. Of these , 454 were diagnosed with HGSC. We used Cox regression to derive hazard ratios ( HRs) comparing the risk of disease in women who had each of a range of medical diagnoses and surgical procedures with women who did not. We found an increased risk of HGSC associated with a diagnosis of pelvic<disease> inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> ( PID) ( HR 1.47 , 95 % CI 1.04-2.07) but not with a diagnosis of infertility<symptom> or endometriosis with HRs of 1.12 ( 95 % CI 0.73-1.71) and 0.82 ( 95 % CI 0.55-1.22) respectively. A personal history of breast cancer was associated with a three-fold increase in the rate of HGSC. Increased parity was associated with a reduced risk of HGSC in women without a personal history of breast cancer ( HR 0.57; 95 % CI 0.44-0.73) , but not in women with a personal history of breast cancer ( HR 1.48; 95 % CI 0.74-2.95). Our finding of an increased risk of HGSC associated with PID lends support to the hypothesis that inflammatory processes may be involved in the etiology of HGSC.
