  Integrin , alpha9 subunit ( hereinafter , alpha9) has been identified as a novel putative therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA). Support for this target comes from the observations that alpha9 is overexpressed both in the joints of RA patients and in animal models of arthritis<disease>. In the experimental models , the increase in alpha9 expression precedes the onset of arthritic symptoms. The current study presents data on the pharmacological profile of an anti-alpha9 antibody in a collagen-induced arthritis<disease> ( CIA) mouse model. Administration of an alpha9-blocking antibody in CIA mice suppressed the development of arthritis<disease> and significantly decreased plasma level of activated fibroblast-like synoviocyte ( FLS)- derived biomarkers without reducing the formation of anti-type II collagen antibodies. While anti-alpha9 antibody administration significantly suppress the accumulation of immune cells in arthritic joints it had no effect on immune cell number in the spleen. Furthermore , in non-arthritic mice , alpha9 had no inhibitory effect in either a mixed lymphocyte<symptom> reaction ( MLR) or in a delayed type hypersensitivity<disease> ( DTH) reaction. These results suggest that blocking alpha9 exerts its anti-arthritic effect through suppression of FLS-activation via a non-immune mediated mechanism. Finally , therapeutic administration of anti-alpha9 antibody alleviated established arthritis<disease> in CIA mice. Our data provide evidence that alpha9 blockade is a promising therapy for joint<symptom> inflammation<symptom> with minimal systemic immunomodulation.
