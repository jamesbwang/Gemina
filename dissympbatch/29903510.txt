  Patient-reported outcomes are measured in chronic<disease> disease<disease> states to inform intervention and management decisions while minimizing negative outcomes. We hypothesized that health-related quality of life in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A would be worse than the general US population but similar to other chronic<disease> diseases<disease>. Adults ≥ 18 years with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A were recruited to complete the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29-item questionnaire ( n = 45). Scores based on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System T-score metric were compared with the general US population and with cohorts with low back pain , cancer , congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , major depressive disorder , rheumatoid arthritis<disease> , neuroendocrine tumors , primary hyperparathyroidism , and MEN1. Compared with US normative data , multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A patients reported worse anxiety<symptom> ( 58.2 ± 12.0 , P < .0001) , depression<symptom> ( 55.4 ± 12.0 , P < .01) , fatigue<symptom> ( 61.4 ± 10.8 , P < .0001) , pain interference ( 54.0 ± 11.5 , P < .05) , and sleep disturbance ( 56.9 ± 2.7 , P < .001) , as well as significantly lower physical functioning ( 45.7 ± 9.3 , P < .01) and ability to participate in social roles ( 46.4 ± 9.7 , P < .05). Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A patients reported greater fatigue<symptom> than patients with cancer ( P < .0001) , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P = .01) , rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( P = .0002) , neuroendocrine tumors ( P = .0007) , and primary hyperparathyroidism ( P < .0001) but higher physical functioning compared with patients with rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( P = .02) , low back pain , congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( P < .0001). This study is the first to use the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System to compare patient-reported outcomes between multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A and other chronic conditions. Individuals with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A reported worse health-related quality of life in all 7 domains compared with US normative data. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A patients reported greater fatigue<symptom> but greater physical function compared with several other conditions. Prospective longitudinal evaluation of patient-reported outcomes in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A should be conducted to identify treatments associated with the highest health-related quality of life.
