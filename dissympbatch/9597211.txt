  The complex pathogenesis of sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom> involves myocardial depression<symptom> , the pathophysiology of which , however , remains unclear. In this study , cellular mechanisms of myocardial depression<symptom> were addressed in a clinically relevant , large animal ( porcine) model of sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom>. Sepsis<disease> was induced by fecal peritonitis<disease> in eight anesthetized , mechanically ventilated , and instrumented pigs of both sexes and continued for 24 h. In eight control pigs , an identical experiment but without sepsis<disease> induction was performed.
