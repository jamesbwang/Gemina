  In male-to-female genital sex reassignment surgery , the clitoris , its prepuce , and the labia minora remain among the most difficult structures to construct. We describe the authors ' clitoroplasty and vulvoplasty technique. All patients who underwent male-to-female sex reassignment surgery at a single center , between June 2012 and June 2016 , were prospectively included. The standard pedicled island<disease> neurovascular flap of the glans penis was harvested in a letter M fashion with attached preputial skin. The central triangle of the M was used for the neoclitoris formation. Labia minora and the clitoral prepuce were created with both legs of the M and the preputial skin attached to it. Tactile and erogenous sensitivity was evaluated. Ninety-seven patients were included ( mean age , 32 years; range , 17-54 years). All clitoroplasties and vulvoplasties were completed in the same surgical stage as the vaginoplasty. There were no cases of deep or total flap necrosis<symptom>. Eight patients developed partial and superficial<disease> skin<symptom> necrosis<symptom> of the flap; one presented an abscess<disease> in labia majora , and another patient had urethral hematoma; both required drainage. None of the complications left any sequelae. At 6 months ' follow-up all patients maintained tactile and erogenous sensitivity. The proposed technique represents an aesthetic refinement of the previously described pedicled glans penis flap by allowing the creation of a sensate neoclitoris , its preputial hood , and labia minora with excellent outcomes in the same surgical stage as the sex reassignment.
