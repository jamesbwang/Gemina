  Management of tracheal stenosis remains controversial. Endoscopic interventions commonly provide immediate relief of symptoms , but are associated with high recurrence rates. In contrast , high success rates have been reported in patients undergoing tracheal resection. However , well-defined indications and contraindications for tracheal resection are lacking and previous studies commonly ignore patient-related outcomes ( e.g. dyspnoea). We aimed to evaluate the outcome of tracheal resection at our institution and identify risk factors for complications. All adult patients undergoing tracheal resection at Aarhus University Hospital between January 2009 and September 2016 were included RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were included. The most frequent aetiologies for tracheal stenosis were previous tracheostomy ( n = 8) , prolonged intubation ( n = 3) , a combination of the two ( n = 5) , and intraluminal tumour ( n = 7). Sixteen patients underwent high tracheal resection , seven patients low tracheal resection , and four patients partial cricotracheal resection. Surgical success ( no dyspnoea and no need for additional intervention) was achieved in 74 % of patients. Four of six patients undergoing resection because of malignant disease were recurrence-free during the follow-up period. Fifteen ( 56 %) patients suffered complications ( transient or permanent). Four ( 15 %) patients had recurrent stenosis and underwent reintervention. Other permanent complications included idiopathic hoarseness<symptom> ( 15 %) , unilateral recurrent nerve palsy ( 11 %) , and dysphagia<symptom> ( 7 %). Previous treatment ( endoscopic and open surgery) ( OR = 5.5 , p = 0.06) and chronic<disease> diseases<disease> ( OR = 8.3 , p = 0.02) were associated with increased risk for complications. Tracheal resection was efficient treatment for the alleviation of dyspnoea in adults with tracheal stenosis. However , complications were frequent and careful preoperative patient selection and information are crucial.
