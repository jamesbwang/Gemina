  Diabetes is associated with various complications and reduced quality of life. Of the many complications , some are life-threatening. Among these , foot complications remain an important concern. The major foot complications include foot ulceration , cellulitis<disease> , abscess<disease> , wet gangrene<disease> , dry gangrene<disease> , and necrotizing fasciitis<disease> , with different pathophysiological concepts behind each of them. Gangrene<disease> occurs due to reduced blood supply in the body tissues that leads to necrosis<symptom>. This condition may arise because of an injury , infection , or other health conditions , majorly diabetes. Gangrene<disease> is classified as dry , wet , and gas<disease> gangrene<disease> In case of wet and gas<disease> gangrene<disease> , surgical amputation is usually performed to prevent the spread of infection to other tissues. In dry gangrene<disease> , due to the presence of clear demarcation , autoamputation is preferred in certain parts of the globe. The present review aims to analyze the mode of dry gangrene<disease> management in diabetic patients based on previous evidence and plans to highlight various management strategies available for dry gangrene<disease> and the advantages/disadvantages of different treatments with special consideration to autoamputation.
