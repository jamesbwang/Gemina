  Many of the clinical risk scores routinely used for chest<symptom> pain<symptom> assessment have not been validated in patients at high risk for acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS). We performed an independent comparison of HEART , TIMI , GRACE , FRISC , and PURSUIT scores for identifying chest<symptom> pain<symptom> due to ACS and for predicting 30-day death or re-infarction in patients arriving through Emergency Medical Services ( EMS). We enrolled consecutive EMS patients evaluated for chest<symptom> pain<symptom> at three emergency departments. A reviewer blinded to outcome data retrospectively reviewed patient charts to compute each risk score. The primary outcome was ACS diagnosed during the primary admission , and the secondary outcome was death or re-infarction within 30-days of initial presentation. Our sample included 750 patients ( aged 59 ± 17 years , 42 % female) , of whom 115 ( 15.3 %) had ACS and 33 ( 4.4 %) had 30-day death or re-infarction. The c-statistics of HEART , TIMI , GRACE , FRISC , and PURSUIT for identifying ACS were 0.87 , 0.86 , 0.73 , 0.84 , and 0.79 , respectively , and for predicting 30-day death or re-infarction were 0.70 , 0.73 , 0.72 , 0.72 , and 0.62 , respectively. Sensitivity/negative predictive value of HEART ≥ 4 and TIMI ≥ 3 for ACS detection were 0.94/ 0.98 and 0.87/ 0.97 , respectively. In chest<symptom> pain<symptom> patients admitted through EMS , HEART and TIMI outperform other scores for identifying chest<symptom> pain<symptom> due to ACS. Although both have similar negative predictive value , HEART has better sensitivity and lower rate of false negative results , thus it can be used preferentially over TIMI in the initial triage of this population.
