  Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug that has a narrow therapeutic index. Poisoning<disease> typically shows 3 phases with systemic symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms dominate in the first phase. Dermatologic manifestations usually appear , with skin eruptions in the second phase where multiorgan failure occurs and alopecia in the third phase where organ derangements resolve. Alopecia is a cardinal feature of the third phase , but there is no specifically defined eruption for toxication. Here , we report a case of colchicine intoxication in a 16-year-old girl with maculopapular/purpuric rash<symptom> and alopecia.
