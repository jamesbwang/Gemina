  Acute myocardial infarction ( AMI) is the leading cause of death in women worldwide. Every year , in the USA alone , more than 30,000 young women < 55 years of age are hospitalized with AMI. In recent decades , the incidence of AMI is increasing in younger women in the context of increasing metabolic syndrome<disease> , diabetes mellitus , and non-traditional risk factors such as stress , anxiety<symptom> , and depression<symptom> Although women are classically considered to present with atypical chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , several observational data confirm that men and women experience similar rates of chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , with some differences in intensity , duration , radiation , and the choice of descriptors. Women also experience more number of symptoms and more prodromal symptoms compared with men. Suboptimal awareness , sociocultural and financial reasons result in pre-hospital delays in women and lower rates of access to care with resulting undertreatment with guideline-directed therapies. Causes of AMI in young women include plaque-related MI , microvascular dysfunction or vasospasm , and spontaneous coronary artery dissection. Compared with men , women have greater in-hospital , early and late mortality , as a result of baseline comorbidities. Post-AMI women have lower referral to cardiac rehabilitation with more dropouts , lower levels of physical activity , and poorer improvements in health status compared with men , with higher inflammatory levels at 1-year from index presentation. Future strategies should focus on primary and secondary prevention , adherence , and post-AMI health-related quality of life. This review discusses the current evidence in the epidemiology , diagnosis , and treatment of AMI in young women.
