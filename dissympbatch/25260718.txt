  Patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) are at risk of transient myocardial ischemia ( TMI) , which could lead to serious morbidity or even mortality. Early detection of myocardial ischemia can reduce damage to heart tissues and improve patient condition. Significant ST change in the electrocardiogram ( ECG) is an important marker for detecting myocardial ischemia during the rule-out phase of potential ACS. However , current ECG monitoring software is vastly underused due to excessive false alarms. The present study aims to tackle this problem by combining a novel image-based approach with deep learning techniques to improve the detection accuracy of significant ST depression<symptom> change. The obtained convolutional neural network ( CNN) model yields an average area under the curve ( AUC) at 89.6 % from an independent testing set. At selected optimal cutoff thresholds , the proposed model yields a mean sensitivity at 84.4 % while maintaining specificity at 84.9 %.
