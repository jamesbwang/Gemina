  Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPNs) greatly increase the risk of maternal and fetal complications during pregnancy. Currently , international agreements regarding the management of these women are lacking. Our study aimed to assess the current management and outcomes of MPN pregnancies in a French cohort. We retrospectively analyzed 27 pregnancies in women with MPNs that were associated with a specific mutation. Nineteen pregnancies in nine women with essential thrombocythemia and eight pregnancies in five women with polycythemia vera were identified. Our study showed 70 % live births , but only 30 % uneventful pregnancies. Fetal complications were mainly early spontaneous<disease> abortions<disease> ( 22 %) , fetal growth restriction ( 15 %) , and premature delivery ( 15 %). Maternal issues were divided between thrombosis ( 15 %) and hemorrhages<symptom> ( 11 %). High rates of preeclampsia and hemolysis<symptom> , elevated liver enzymes , and low platelet count syndrome<disease> ( 15 %) were reported. Uterine artery Doppler was performed in 70 % pregnancies. Abnormal Doppler results were found in 43 % pregnancies. Pregnancies with high platelet counts and packed cell volume remaining static or increasing ended with fetal death and utero-placental dysfunction. According to expert consensus , most of the pregnancies ( 67 %) could be stratified in the high risk group and had a bad obstetrical outcome , with 50 % standard-risk pregnancies versus 22 % high-risk pregnancies that were uneventful. Higher risk pregnancies were prescribed heparin and/or interferon α in 72 %. The prognosis of these pregnancies remains very bad and may be improved by a more effective collaboration between specialists as well as a therapeutic intensification including heparin and interferon α.
