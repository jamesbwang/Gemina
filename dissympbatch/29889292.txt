  To assess the wound<disease> healing , inflammation<symptom> , and tissue ultrastructure in the human corneal stroma after small incision lenticule extraction ( SMILE) and femtosecond laser-assisted LASIK ( FS-LASIK). Sixteen corneoscleral discs of 16 human donors unsuitable for corneal transplantation were obtained from an eye bank. Eight eyes underwent SMILE with -5.00 diopters ( D) of myopic correction; in 3 of them the lenticule was not extracted. Further 5 donor corneas<symptom> were subjected to FS-LASIK with -5.00 D ablation , and 3 eyes served as the control group without surgical intervention. Postoperatively , specimens were incubated in organ culture medium for 72 hours before being subjected to immunofluorescence staining for CD11b , Ki67 , fibronectin , terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick-end labelling assay , and high-magnification scanning electron microscopy. Keratocyte apoptosis , keratocyte proliferation , and infiltration of immune cells were generally mild and comparable between FS-LASIK and SMILE ( irrespective of surgical lenticule extraction). By staining for fibronectin , we observed a trend toward milder fibrotic response in the corneal stroma after SMILE than after FS-LASIK. On the contrary , scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed a smoother , more regular ultrastructural appearance of the residual corneal bed after FS-LASIK. Corneal stromal wound<disease> healing after SMILE and FS-LASIK was virtually identical with respect to keratocyte proliferation and apoptosis in the human donor eye model. Although reactive fibrosis<disease> adjacent to the laser application site appeared less marked after SMILE , the stromal bed after LASIK exhibited a smoother surface texture.
