  Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) are increasingly used in daily clinical practice in elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) despite limited evidence. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of PCI on short and long term survivals in a large cohort of elderly patients with ACS from a `` real world ''. We enrolled 491 patients aged ≥ 70 years admitted to our institution with ACS from 2006 to 2012. Effect of PCI on short and long term survival was evaluated in both overall and a propensity score-matched cohort. The mean age of the overall cohort is 83 ± 6 years. Among them , 285 were treated with PCI , whereas 206 were not. Patients treated with PCI were younger ( 82 ± 5 vs. 85 ± 6) , more males ( 67 % vs. 46 %) , with lower heart rate ( 77 ± 22 vs. 84 ± 21) , higher eGFR ( 58 ± 20 vs. 47 ± 23) , and less with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( 29 % vs. 15 %) ( all p < 0.001). In both overall and propensity-matched population , improved survival was associated with PCI-treatment at 1 and 3 years ( p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Furthermore , by using multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression model following factors were identified as independent predictors of 3-year all-cause mortality: age ( HR 1.08 , 95 % CI 1.00-1.16) , heart rate ( HR 1.02 , 95 % CI 1.01-1.03) , eGFR ( HR 3.07 , 95 % CI 1.63-5.77) , malignancy ( HR 2.03 , 95 % CI 1.27-4.57) , prior CABG ( HR 2.033 , 95 % CI 1.27-4.57) , medication with statin ( HR 0.40 , 95 % CI 0.19-0.86) in PCI group , whereas age ( HR 1.08 , 95 % CI 1.03-1.13) , heart rate ( HR 1.01 , 95 % CI 1.01-1.02) , hypertension ( HR 1.87 , 95 % CI 1.01-3.49) and using of ACEI/ARB ( HR 0.46 , 95 % CI 0.28-0.76) in non-PCI group. In elderly ACS patients , PCI-treatment was associated with improved 1 and 3-year survival and PCI-treated patients had different prognostic profile compared to those without PCI treatment.
