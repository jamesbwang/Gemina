  To know the sputum<symptom> smear and culture conversion among multidrug resistance tuberculosis<disease> ( MDR-TB) patients. The longitudinal cohort study was conducted for 142 MDR-TB patients registered in 2010 under Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme of Vadodara region. Three follow-ups were taken for sputum<symptom> and culture examination , at completion of 6 , 12 , and 24 months of treatment. Individuals were interviewed to know the reasons for missed dose and default. The sputum<symptom> smear and culture conversion rate was 43.4 % , 47.7 % , and 57 % at 6 months , 12 months , and 24 months of follow-up , respectively. Treatment default rate was highest ( 15.2 %) within initial 6 months of therapy. The mean time to sputum<symptom> smear and culture conversion was 120.27 days and 125.02 days , respectively. Most of patients who were culture positive at 6 months remained so even after 12 months. There was not much difference in the time taken for culture and sputum<symptom> conversion.
