  Interleukin-7 is critical for T-cell development and displays antimicrobial and antitumor properties. It is referred to as a `` critical enhancer of protective immunity ''. However , there is no information on interleukin-7 dynamics following colorectal surgery. Moreover , although robot-assisted surgery is gaining popularity , data on the immune response to it is almost non-existent. In this prospective non-randomized case-control study we found interleukin-7 dynamics to differ following robot-assisted and open approach and to affect postoperative immunity. Linear increases were seen in the robotic group while a cubic pattern with a maximum at 8 h in the open one. Low preoperative interleukin-7 was associated with developing surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> In turn , higher preoperative interleukin-7 was associated with preserved immune function: less pronounced drop in lymphocyte<symptom> count and higher Δlymphocyte/Δneutrophil ratio in patients undergoing robotic surgery. The changes in other cytokines , namely , interleukin-12 ( p70) , TNFα , interferon-γ , and interleukin-10 were independently associated with interleukin-7 dynamics. In turn , relative changes in interleukin-7 were independent predictors of changes in interferon-γ , key cytokine of favourable Th1 immune response. Taken together , we demonstrated different perioperative dynamics of interleukin-7 , which may contribute to favourable outcomes following robotic colorectal surgery including lower incidence of surgical<disease> site<disease> infections<disease> , milder surgery-induced lymphopenia , and beneficial interferon-γ dynamics.
