  The incidence of periodontitis<disease> is higher when metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MS) is present. However , only few Korean studies have compared the risk factors for MS and periodontitis<disease> Therefore , this study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for periodontitis<disease> relative to the presence of MS. The data collected from 13,196 respondents of the 2010-2015 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in South Korea , which include periodontitis<disease> and MS parameters , were analyzed after propensity score matching of sex and age. A total of 29 % of the participants had periodontitis<disease> The periodontitis<disease> group had more males ( 53 %) , lower number of participants who had a high educational level ( 66.6 %) , and higher body mass index ( 24.3 ± 3.2) and waist circumference ( 83.8 ± 9.2) than the nonperiodontitis group. Moreover , the periodontitis<disease> group exhibited higher systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and fasting plasma glucose and plasma triglyceride levels , but lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than the nonperiodontitis group ( P < 0.001). Several patients in the periodontitis<disease> group had hypertension ( 43.3 %) and diabetes mellitus ( 17.3 %) , but only few had chronic kidney disease ( 3.4 %). Multiple regression analysis showed that the risk of periodontitis<disease> increased when MS , diabetes mellitus , and smoking history were present. Particularly , the risk of periodontitis<disease> increased as the number of MS components increased ( P < 0.001). Patients with MS had 1.12-fold higher risk of periodontitis<disease> than those without. Additionally , patients who had diabetes mellitus and were smokers had a particularly high risk of periodontitis<disease> The risk of periodontitis<disease> increased as the number of MS components increased.
