  A 69-year-old man was admitted with non-resolving right leg cellulitis<disease> Subsequent skin<symptom> changes<symptom> over the calf and discharging pus suggested necrotising fasciitis<disease>. After several wound<disease> debridements of the leg and imaging , the patient was found to have an iliopsoas abscess<disease> due to a metastatic perforated caecal tumour extending along the medial thigh to the calf. No micro-organisms indicative of typical necrotising fasciitis<disease> were isolated from the wound<disease>. The patient had an ileocaecal resection , and his leg was reconstructed with a split thickness skin graft. He continues to do well postoperatively. This case highlights key lessons when dealing with an unusual presentation leading to challenges in diagnosis such as: ( 1) the need for good interspecialty liaison , ( 2) prompt senior review and plan , and ( 3) ` thinking outside the box ' when faced with a diagnostic challenge.
