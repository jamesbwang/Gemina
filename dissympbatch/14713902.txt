  Takayasu 's arteritis ( TA) is a large-vessel vasculitis pathologically characterized by granulomatous necrotizing vasculitis with giant cells. Although the cause of TA is still unclear , genetic factors as well as immunological abnormalities , particularly the overactivation of Th1 and Th-17 , are considered to play important roles in the pathogenesis of this disease. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis<disease> ( EGE) is a type of refractory inflammation<symptom> in which numerous eosinophils infiltrate the inflammatory area. It is known that the overactivation of Th2 is associated with the pathogenesis of EGE , although the cause of EGE is still unclear. The immunological abnormalities in TA are therefore thought to be different from those in EGE. To date , no cases of complication of TA and EGE have been reported. An 18 year-old female was diagnosed with EGE and treated with prednisolone. At 6 months after completion of the treatment , the patient experienced chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , and was diagnosed with TA. TH1 and TH17 immunity are thought to be involved with TA , while TH2 are considered to be involved with EGE. In this case , the expression of IL-17 mRNA in the colon mucosa greatly decreased after prednisolone treatment for EGE. This is the first report of TA complicated with EGE , and the overactivation of TH17 is considered to be associated with the pathogenesis of these two diseases.
