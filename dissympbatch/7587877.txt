  Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma ( EHE) involving serous effusion<symptom> is extremely rare , and the diagnosis can be challenging. DNA ploidy quantitation of EHE in effusion<symptom> fluids has not been previously described in the English-language literature. Specimens of cytological diagnosed with EHE in effusion<symptom> fluids between 2002 and 2009 were retrieved from the pathology files at MD Anderson Cancer Center. A total of four cases of EHE involving or arising from effusion<symptom> fluids were found , and we reviewed cytospin , smears , cell block sections , and immunostained slides. DNA image analysis for ploidy and proliferation evaluation was performed on a destained , papanicolaou-stained slide from each case. The tumor cells were epithelioid with prominent cytoplasmic vacuolization and intracytoplasmic inclusions<disease> , which could resemble reactive mesothelial cells , mesothelioma , or adenocarcinoma. The tumor cells were positive for endothelial markers. DNA image analysis in three of the four cases revealed predominantly diploid and tetraploid subpopulations , with few aneuploid cells and fairly low proliferation indices , and these patients had fairly prolonged survival. DNA image analysis is useful for differentiating EHE from reactive mesothelial cells and high-grade carcinoma. For accurate diagnosis of EHE in effusion<symptom> fluids , cytologic features should be considered together with clinical history and ancillary studies.
