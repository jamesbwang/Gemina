  Previous clinical trials have addressed the beneficial effects of fish oil supplementation on atopic dermatitis<disease>. Recently , we reported that fat-1 mice , which can convert n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs) , are protected against allergic airway inflammation<symptom> because their Th2 immune responses are suppressed. Here , we examined the effects of endogenously synthesized n-3 PUFAs on atopic dermatitis<disease> , a representative Th2-dominant allergic inflammatory<disease> disease<disease>. Mouse models of atopic dermatitis-like skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> were prepared by epicutaneous application of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene ( DNCB) or house dust mite ( HDM) extract to the ears<disease>. DNCB-treated fat-1 mice exhibited markedly reduced epidermal thickening , lower mast cell infiltration , and lower serum IgE and histamine compared with wild-type mice. The draining lymph nodes of fat-1 mice were substantially smaller and contained significantly smaller proportions of activated CD4
