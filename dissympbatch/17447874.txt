  Prevalent co-occurring poor diet and physical inactivity convey chronic<disease> disease<disease> risk to the population. Large magnitude behavior change can improve behaviors to recommended levels , but multiple behavior change interventions produce small , poorly maintained effects. The Make Better Choices 2 trial tested whether a multicomponent intervention integrating mHealth , modest incentives , and remote coaching could sustainably improve diet and activity. Between 2012 and 2014 , the 9-month randomized controlled trial enrolled 212 Chicago area adults with low fruit and vegetable and high saturated fat intakes , low<symptom> moderate<symptom> to vigorous physical activity ( MVPA) and high sedentary leisure screen time. Participants were recruited by advertisements to an open-access website , screened , and randomly assigned to either of two active interventions targeting MVPA simultaneously with , or sequentially after other diet and activity targets ( N = 84 per intervention) or a stress and sleep contact control intervention ( N = 44). They used a smartphone app and accelerometer to track targeted behaviors and received personalized remote coaching from trained paraprofessionals. Perfect behavioral adherence was rewarded with an incentive of US $ 5 per week for 12 weeks. Diet and activity behaviors were measured at baseline , 3 , 6 , and 9 months; primary outcome was 9-month diet and activity composite improvement. Both simultaneous and sequential interventions produced large , sustained improvements exceeding control ( P < .001) , and brought all diet and activity behaviors to guideline levels. At 9 months , the interventions increased fruits and vegetables by 6.5 servings per day ( 95 % CI 6.1-6.8) , increased MVPA by 24.7 minutes per day ( 95 % CI 20.0-29.5) , decreased sedentary leisure by 170.5 minutes per day ( 95 % CI -183.5 to -157.5) , and decreased saturated fat intake by 3.6 % ( 95 % CI -4.1 to -3.1). Retention through 9-month follow-up was 82.1 %. Self-monitoring decreased from 96.3 % of days at baseline to 72.3 % at 3 months , 63.5 % at 6 months , and 54.6 % at 9 months ( P < .001). Neither attrition nor decline in self-monitoring differed across intervention groups. Multicomponent mHealth diet and activity intervention involving connected coaching and modest initial performance incentives holds potential to reduce chronic<disease> disease<disease> risk.
