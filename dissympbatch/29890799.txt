  To explore the methods and results of modified one-stage revision procedure for treating proximal femoral infected nonunion after intramedullary nail fixation. From June 2010 to June 2015 , 10 patients of proximal femoral infected nonunion after intramedullary nail fixation were treated with modified one-stage revision procedure , including 9 males and 1 female , ranging in age from 35 to 77 years old. There were 3 cases of intertrochanteric fractures , 2 cases of intertrochanteric fractures accompanied with proximal femoral fractures and 5 cases of subtrochaneric fracures. The fractures ware fixed by LISS plate after radically debridement. The bone defects were repaired by free vascularized fibular graft and autogenous cancellous bone graft mixed artificial bone containing antibiotics. Postoperatively , ambulation without weight bearing was encouraged as early as possible. Ten patients were followed up from 9 to 30 months and all nonunions healed smoothly without wound<disease> infection<disease> recurrence or internal fixation failure at the final follow-up. The time for full weight bearing was from 12 to 28 weeks. The hip<symptom> joint function was evaluated by Sanders Traumatic Hip Rating Scale , the result was excellent in 7 cases , good in 2 , and fair in 1 at the final follow-up. Modified one-stage revision procedure is an effective treatment with a good functional result for proximal femoral infected nonunion after intramedullary nail fixation. On the basis of radical debridement , the combination of infection control and bone healing therapeutic techniques is key for success.
