  None The mice were administered with GLP by intragastric gavage daily for two weeks prior to the DSS treatment. Mice were orally administered with 2.5 % DSS dissolved in drinking water with GLP or water treatment for 6 days. The mice were killed on day 7 after induction of colitis<disease>. Survival rates , body<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , colon lengths , histological changes , and disease activity index scores ( DAI) were evaluated. GLP significantly improved survival rates , colon length shortening , body<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , histopathological score , and DAI scores in mice with DSS-induced colitis<disease>. GLP markedly suppressed the secretions of TNF- GLP prevented inflammation<symptom> , maintained intestinal homeostasis , and regulated the intestinal immunological barrier functions in mice with DSS-induced
