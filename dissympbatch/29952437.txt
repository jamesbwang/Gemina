  Parenteral Nutrition ( PN) is a life-saving treatment used for patients with Intestinal<symptom> Failure<symptom> ( IF). PN is complex and demands highly specialised care to avoid serious complications in the home setting. All tertiary centres in the Republic of Ireland ( ROI) were contacted to assess the prevalence of IF requiring PN and complications , over a one year period. Sixty-seven patients were treated across 15 centres: a period prevalence of 14.6 and 9.6 patients per million for long-term PN and home PN respectively. Three-quarters of patients experienced at least one major complication with 18 % mortality rate over the study period. There were 2.86 admissions per HPN patient , each lasting mean 13.4 days. One-third experienced catheter-related<disease> infections<disease>. There was a reduced length of stay during emergency re-admissions in high volume centres ( mean 31 v 43 days , p = 0.17). The establishment of a National Centre for IF/HPN in ROI is integral to reducing PN-associated complications.
