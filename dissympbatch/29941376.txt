  A carotid cavernous fistula<disease> is a rare type of arteriovenous ( AV) fistula<disease> due to an abnormal communication between the cavernous sinus and the carotid arterial system. Normal venous return to the cavernous sinus is impeded as high-pressure arterial blood enters the cavernous sinus. The classical triad of symptoms is characterized by pulsating exophthalmos , ocular bruit , and conjunctival chemosis. However , it is important to note that some patients do not exhibit this triad of symptoms. A 49-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department ( ED) with a chief complaint of `` there is a heartbeat in my eye. '' Pertinent history included an episode of trauma 2 months prior to his onset of unilateral vision loss<symptom>. Computed tomography scan of the head obtained in the ED upon his initial injury was unrevealing. Despite no identifiable pathology , his pain had gradually worsened since ED discharge. On this occasion , an ocular bruit was appreciated over the affected eye , prompting further diagnostic testing. The patient was admitted for urgent cerebral angiography and definitive endovascular neurosurgical intervention to preserve his eyesight. We discuss the clinical presentation , pathophysiology , and diagnostic modalities important to the management of this rare and potentially devastating cause of vision loss<symptom>. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: A carotid cavernous fistula<disease> is a rare and easily misdiagnosed cause of unilateral ocular pain in the ED. Further , it emphasizes the importance of a detailed clinical history and physical examination to make this diagnosis and save eyesight.
