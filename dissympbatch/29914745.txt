  This paper describes the clinical features of paediatric patients with tracheal bronchus ( TB) identified with flexible bronchoscopy ( FB) in a tertiary care hospital. A retrospective review of every FB with diagnosis of TB carried out in our centre since 1990 was performed which considered specifically: age at diagnosis , gender , semiology , somatic anomalies , tracheal bronchus type , other bronchoscopic findings and clinical progress. Out of 1665 FB in 1337 patients , TB was found in 26 ( 1.9 %). The median age was 15 months ( age range 1 month-13 years) , with no gender differences. Of 26 patients , a total of 24 had associated congenital pathologies ( 92.3 %) ( heart disease 69 % , chromosomal abnormality 35 % and spinal fusion defect 11 %). FB was performed for a number of reasons including: recurrent or persistent wheezing , pneumonia<disease> or atelectasis , persistent stridor and refractory cough<symptom> The type of TB identified was primarily ectopic lobar of the right upper lobe ( 73 %) and the apical supernumerary ( 11.5 %). In addition to TB , other defects were found by FB in 90 % of cases , such as tracheomalacia , bronchomalacia or tracheal stenosis. The review confirmed a higher prevalence of TB than expected in previous series and highlighted its association with other airway or somatic malformations , notably congenital cardiac defects and spinal fusion defects. All patients were managed conservatively for the TB.
