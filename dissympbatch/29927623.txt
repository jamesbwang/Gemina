  Tendon injuries are common problems among athletes. Complete recovery of the mechanical structure and function of ruptured tendons is challenging. It has been demonstrated that upregulation of glycolysis and lactate production occurs in wounds<disease> , inflammation<symptom> sites , and cancerous tumors , and these metabolic changes also control growth and differentiation of stem and progenitor cells. Similar metabolic changes have been reported in human healing tendons. In addition , lactate production has increased in progenitors isolated from injured tendons after treatment with IL-1Î². It is thought that the metabolic changes play a role in tendon healing after injury. Glucose metabolism is altered during tendon injury and healing , and modulation of this altered metabolism improves tendon repair. Controlled laboratory study. The authors used the tendon injury model involving a complete incision of the Achilles tendon in C57BL/6J female mice and studied alterations of glucose metabolism in injured tendons with ( U- Significant changes in glucose metabolism in tendons after injury surgery were detected. The findings indicate that injured tendons acutely increase glycolysis and lactate synthesis after injury and that the inhibition of lactate synthesis by DCA is beneficial for tendon healing. Changing metabolism in injured tendons may be a therapeutic target for tendon repair.
