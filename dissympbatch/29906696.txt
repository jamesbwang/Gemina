  Epilepsy is the most common neurological<symptom> symptom<symptom> in tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC) , occurring in 72-85 % of affected individuals. Despite the large number of patients reported , their electroclinical phenotype has been rarely described. We analyzed seizure<symptom> semiology through ictal video-electroencephalography ( V-EEG) recordings in a large series of patients. In this multicenter study , we reviewed V-EEGs of 51 patients: ictal recordings were analyzed in correlation with their clinical variables. The median age of epilepsy onset was six months ( one day-16 years) , with onset in the first year of life in 71 % patients ( 36/51) , in 10 of them during the neonatal period. Sixty-five percent of patients ( 33/51) experienced epileptic spasms in their life , with late-onset ( > two years) in five; 42 % of the epileptic spasms persisted after age two years , despite the onset in the first year of life. We identified four different electroclinical subsets: focal epilepsy ( 35 % , 18/51) , Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome<disease> evolution ( 27 % , 14/51) , focal seizures<symptom> with persisting spasms ( 33 % , 17/51) , and spasms only ( 4 % , 2/51). We reviewed 45 focal seizures<symptom> , 13 clusters of epileptic spasms , and seven generalized seizures<symptom>. In 12 patients , we recorded different seizure<symptom> types. In 71 % of the focal seizures<symptom> ( 32/45) , the ictal pattern was focal without diffusion. In 38 % of the patients ( 5/13) epileptic spasms were related to typical diffuse slow wave pattern associated with superimposed fast activity , with focal predominance. Focal seizures<symptom> and focal spasms resulted as the most frequent seizure<symptom> types in TSC. Seizure<symptom> onset was variable but showing a predominant involvement of the frontocentral regions ( 40 %). Discrete clinical signs characterized the seizures<symptom> , and behavioral arrest was the predominant first clinical objective sign. Epileptic spasms were a typical presentation at all ages , frequently asymmetrical and associated with lateralizing features , especially in older patients.
