  Our aim was to identify biophysical biomarkers of ventricular remodelling in tachycardia-induced dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM). Our study includes healthy controls ( N = 7) and DCM pigs ( N = 10). Molecular analysis showed global myocardial metabolic abnormalities , some of them related to myocardial hibernation in failing hearts , supporting the translationality of our model to study cardiac remodelling in dilated cardiomyopathy. Histological analysis showed unorganized and agglomerated collagen accumulation in the dilated ventricles and a higher percentage of fibrosis<disease> in the right ( RV) than in the left ( LV) ventricle ( P = .016). The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy ( FTIR) 1st and 2nd indicators , which are markers of the myofiber/collagen ratio , were reduced in dilated<symptom> hearts , with the 1st indicator reduced by 45 % and 53 % in the RV and LV , respectively , and the 2nd indicator reduced by 25 % in the RV. The 3rd FTIR indicator , a marker of the carbohydrate/lipid ratio , was up-regulated in the right and left dilated ventricles but to a greater extent in the RV ( 2.60-fold vs 1.61-fold , P = .049). Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC) showed a depression<symptom> of the freezable water melting point in DCM ventricles- indicating structural changes in the tissue architecture- and lower protein stability. Our results suggest that the 1st , 2nd and 3rd FTIR indicators are useful markers of cardiac remodelling. Moreover , the 2nd and 3rd FITR indicators , which are altered to a greater extent in the right ventricle , are associated with greater
