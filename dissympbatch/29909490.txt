  Indigenous preparations ( IPs) have evoked a considerable interest in alleviating infections and chronic<disease> diseases<disease> and improving wellbeing. While such formulations have been a part of traditional practice in several countries and many have been reviewed scientifically for their claims , several of them until date remain to be investigated. A class of IPs for sex selection by Indian pregnant women exists with an aim of begetting a male offspring. In view of the leads obtained from our previous studies on detrimental effects of the newborn , for instance stillbirths<symptom> and congenital malformations , we attempted to investigate the samples for heavy metal toxicity. Three samples were chosen following phytochemical analysis and reproductive toxicity of such preparations under in vivo conditions. The selected samples were examined for heavy metals-lead , cadmium , arsenic , and mercury using Microwave-assisted atomic absorption spectroscopy. The upper limit level of lead , mercury , and cadmium was found to be 18.56 , 0.11 , and 0.84 mg/kg respectively whereas arsenic was not detected. The levels of lead and mercury were found to be manifolds high in the IP samples that were primarily contributed by its constituents. The results of our study indicate the potential risk conferred upon , to both the mother and fetus on account of high levels of lead , mercury , and cadmium.
