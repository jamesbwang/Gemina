  To investigate consistency of lymphocyte<symptom> immunophenotype between labial gland and peripheral blood in patients with primary Sjogren 's syndrome<disease> ( pSS). Seventy-one pSS patients and 35 patients with maxillofacial trauma were included in the study. Based on the ratio of CD20 to CD3 in labial gland from 71 pSS patients , they were divided into the high and ( n = 48) and low CD20 expression group ( n = 23). Lymphocyte<symptom> immunophenotypes in labial glands , course of disease , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR) , C-reactive protein , immunoglobulin , and complement levels were analyzed. In the labial gland , the levels of IgG , IgA , IgM , and C3c were higher , but C1q was lower in the pSS group than in the control group ( all P < .05). CD20 was detected in labial gland samples of all pSS patients , in which CD3 was positive in 66 ( 93.0 %) patients , and negative in 5 ( 7.0 %). The plasma levels of IgG , IgA , IgM , and CRP , and ESR were higher , but serum C4 level was lower in pSS patients than in the control group ( all P < .01). Serum IgG level , ESR , and labial gland CD20 were higher in the high CD20 expression group than the low expression group ( all P < .05). Primary Sjogren 's syndrome<disease> patients had a higher expression of CD20 positive infiltrating lymphocytes of the labial gland , accompanied with the changes of immunoglobulins , and complements in both the labial gland and peripheral blood.
