  Disease models have provided conflicting evidence as to whether spatial heterogeneity promotes or impedes pathogen persistence. Moreover , there has been limited theoretical investigation into how animal movement behavior<symptom> interacts with the spatial organization of resources ( e.g. , clustered , random , uniform) across a landscape to affect infectious<disease> disease<disease> dynamics. Importantly , spatial heterogeneity of resources can sometimes lead to nonlinear or counterintuitive outcomes depending on the host and pathogen system. There is a clear need to develop a general theoretical framework that could be used to create testable predictions for specific host-pathogen systems. Here , we develop an individual-based model integrated with movement ecology approaches to investigate how host movement behaviors<symptom> interact with landscape heterogeneity ( in the form of various levels of resource abundance and clustering) to affect pathogen dynamics. For most of the parameter space , our results support the counterintuitive idea that fragmentation promotes pathogen persistence , but this finding was largely dependent on perceptual range of the host , conspecific density , and recovery rate. For simulations with high conspecific density , slower recovery rates , and larger perceptual ranges , more complex<disease> disease<disease> dynamics emerged , and the most fragmented landscapes were not necessarily the most conducive to outbreaks or pathogen persistence. These results point to the importance of interactions between landscape structure , individual movement behavior<symptom> , and pathogen transmission for predicting and understanding disease dynamics.
