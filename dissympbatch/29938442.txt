  A 51-year-old male was referred to the diabetes clinic by the GP with low HbA1c ( 13 mmol/mol). His complaints were dizziness<symptom> and intermittent palpitations for the last two years. No precipitating cause could be identified. He denied any chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , shortness of breath or syncope. He had a background of schizophrenia , epilepsy , coeliac disease , depression<symptom> and dermatitis<disease> herpetiformis. He was on dapsone , venlafaxine , procyclidine , furosemide , diazepam , omeprazole , meloxicam and folic acid. On examination , his pulse was 82 beats per minute , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> 131/74 mm of Hg , respiratory rate was 14/minute and his saturations on room air were 94 %. Neurologic , cardiovascular , respiratory and abdominal examination was unremarkable. His investigations showed Hb of 121g/L ( 130-180) WCC 7.8 * 10 g/L ( 4-11) , platelets 182 * 10 ( 150-400) , MCV 83 fl ( 80-100) , TSH 2.53 mU/L ( 0.4-4.0 mU/L) , anti TTG 14.9 ( normal). Renal , liver function , serum folate , vitamin B12 and complement levels were within normal limits with a negative ANCA and ANA. His oral glucose tolerance test was negative for diabetes with fasting and twohour post prandial blood sugar of 4.8 mmol/L and 6.9 mmol/L respectively. Because of the history of chronic Dapsone use and possibility of drug induced low HbA1C , patient was investigated along those lines. The low Hba1c was attributed to haemolysis secondary to dapsone. HbA1c improved to 42 mmol/mol within three months following discontinuation of dapsone. His haemoglobin level also normalized ( 142 g/L). Clinicians should consider haemolysis as a possible factor falsely reducing HbA1c while interpreting results in these patients. This is of particular importance in patients with diabetes.
