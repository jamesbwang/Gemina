  Obesity is associated with adipose tissue inflammation<symptom> , insulin resistance , and the development of type 2 diabetes ( T2D). However , our knowledge is mostly based on conventional murine models and promising preclinical studies rarely translated into successful therapies. There is a growing awareness of the limitations of studies in laboratory mice , housed in abnormally hygienic specific pathogen-free ( SPF) conditions , as relevant aspects of the human immune system remain unappreciated. Here , we assessed the impact of housing conditions on adaptive immunity and metabolic disease processes during high-fat diet ( HFD). We therefore compared diet-induced obesity in SPF mice with those housed in non-SPF , so-called `` antigen exposed '' ( AE) conditions. Surprisingly , AE mice fed a HFD maintained increased insulin levels to compensate for insulin resistance , which was reflected in islet hyperplasia<disease> and improved glucose tolerance compared to SPF mice. By contrast , we observed higher proportions of effector/memory T cell subsets in blood and liver of HFD AE mice accompanied by the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-like liver pathology. Thus , our data demonstrate the impact of housing conditions on metabolic alterations. Studies in AE mice , in which physiological microbial exposure was restored , could provide a tool for revealing therapeutic targets for immune-based interventions for T2D patients.
