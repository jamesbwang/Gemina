  Beta blockers ( β-blockers) remain a standard therapy in the early treatment of acute coronary syndromes<disease>. However , β-blocker therapy in patients with cocaine-associated chest<symptom> pain<symptom> ( CACP) continues to be an area of debate due to the potential risk of unopposed α-adrenergic stimulation and coronary vasospasm. Therefore , we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of available studies to compare outcomes of β-blocker versus no β-blocker use among patients with CACP. We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through September 2016 using the keywords ` beta blocker ' , ` cocaine ' and commonly used β-blockers ( ` atenolol ' , ` bisoprolol ' , ` carvedilol ' , ` esmolol ' , ` metoprolol ' and ` propranolol ') to identify studies evaluating β-blocker use among patients with CACP. We specifically focused on studies comparing outcomes between β-blocker versus no β-blocker usage in patients with CACP. Studies without a comparison between β-blocker and no β-blocker use were excluded. Outcomes of interest included non-fatal myocardial infarction ( MI) and all-cause mortality. Quantitative data synthesis was performed using a random-effects model and heterogeneity was assessed using Q and I A total of five studies evaluating 1794 subjects were included. Overall , there was no significant difference on MI in patients with CACP on β-blocker versus no β-blocker ( OR 1.36 , 95 % CI 0.68 to 2.75; p = 0.39). Similarly , there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality in patients on β-blocker versus no β-blocker ( OR 0.68 , 95 % CI 0.26 to 1.79; p = 0.43). In patients presenting with acute<symptom> chest<symptom> pain<symptom> and underlying cocaine , β-blocker use does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of MI or all-cause mortality.
