  Aortic fistula<disease> after esophagectomy is a rare and serious complication. The aims of this study were to describe the causes of and classify the fistulas<disease>. Between January 2008 and December 2017 , a total of 1018 patients underwent esophageal resection , mainly for esophageal cancer; aortic fistula<disease> after esophagectomy was diagnosed in four patients. We perform a literature review through a database search for similar cases. Aortic fistulas<disease> may be classified into two types based on the site at which they occur in relation to the alimentary tract and area of anastomosis. Type 1 fistula<disease> occurs within the area of anastomosis , whereas type 2 fistula<disease> occurs above or below the anastomosis. The risk factors and clinical features associated with aortic fistulas<disease> are described , and comparison between the two types is made. Through a literature search , 39 cases were identified , of which 26 cases were classified as type 1 , and 13 cases were classified as type 2. Of 13 patients ( 33.3 %) who underwent emergent intervention , seven patients survived. Approximately 76.9 % of aortic fistula<disease> were related to anastomotic fistula<disease> , which was more prevalent in type 1 aortic fistula<disease> than in type 2 ( 92 % versus 50 % , P = 0.005). There was no statistically significant difference in age , gender , side of thoracotomy , type of anastomosis , the postoperative day the hemorrhage<symptom> occurred , warning hemorrhage<symptom> , chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , or the outcome between the two types of fistula<disease>. Anastomotic fistula<disease> is the primary cause of type 1 aortic fistula<disease> after esophagectomy , and early diagnosis and intervention of aortic fistula<disease> can improve prognosis. This classification may be a useful guide in determining the approach for second-stage alimentary tract reconstruction.
