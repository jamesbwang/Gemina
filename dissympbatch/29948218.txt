  The CUN-BAE ( Cl√≠nica Universidad de Navarra-Body adiposity estimator) index is an anthropometric index based on age , sex and body mass index ( BMI) for a refined prediction of body fatness in adults. CUN-BAE may help detect metabolically unhealthy individuals with otherwise normal weight according to BMI or waist circumference ( WC). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether CUN-BAE , independent of its components ( BMI , age and sex) , was associated with cardiometabolic conditions including arterial hypertension , diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS). The ENRICA study was based on a cross-sectional sample of non-institutionalized men and women representative of the adult Spanish population. Body<symptom> weight , height , and WC were measured in all participants. The residual of CUN-BAE ( rCUN-BAE) , i.e. the part of the index not explained by its components , was calculated. The associations of CUN-BAE , rCUN-BAE , BMI and WC with hypertension , diabetes and MetS were analysed by multivariate logistic regression , and the Akaike information criterion ( AIC) was calculated. The sample included 12,122 individuals. rCUN-BAE was associated with hypertension ( OR 1.14 , 95 % CI 1.07-1.21) and MetS ( OR 1.48 , 1.37-1.60) , but not with diabetes ( OR 1.05 , 0.94-1.16). In subjects with a BMI < 25 kg/m The CUN-BAE index for body fatness was positively associated with hypertension , diabetes and MetS in adults independent of BMI or WC. CUN-BAE may help to identify individuals with cardiometabolic conditions beyond BMI , but this needs to be confirmed in prospective settings.
