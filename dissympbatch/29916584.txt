  An accurate diagnosis of occupational allergic respiratory<disease> diseases<disease> is crucial because they are related to disability , loss of work and worsening of psychosocial and economic status of workers. Early diagnosis is therefore essential to prevent the progression of allergic respiratory<disease> diseases<disease> and to implement preventive measures. The most frequent occupational allergic respiratory<disease> diseases<disease> are asthma ( OA) and rhinitis ( OR) , less frequently hypersensitivity<disease> pneumonia<disease> ( HP) and non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis<symptom> ( NAEB). The diagnosis is based on the objective evidence of the disease , on a clear correlation with the work activity and the identification of a specific sensitizing agent in the workplace. Reference standard methods are available , such as Specific Inhalation Challenge in the laboratory or in the workplace. A multidisciplinary approach in highly-specialized centres is always recommended for diagnostic confirmation , as it is accompanied by greater diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
