  Early appropriate antibiotic treatment is essential in sepsis<disease>. We aimed to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted educational intervention to improve antibiotic treatment. We hypothesized that the intervention would hasten and improve the appropriateness of empirical antibiotic administration , favor de-escalation , and decrease mortality. We prospectively studied all consecutive patients with sepsis/septic shock<symptom> admitted to 72 intensive care units ( ICUs) throughout Spain in two 4-month periods ( before and immediately after the 3-month intervention). We compared process-of-care variables ( resuscitation bundle and time-to-initiation , appropriateness , and de-escalation of empirical antibiotic treatment) and outcome variables between the two cohorts. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. We analyzed the intervention 's long-term impact in a subset of 50 ICUs. We included 2628 patients ( age 64.1 ± 15.2 years; men 64.0 %; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE) II , 22.0 ± 8.1): 1352 in the preintervention cohort and 1276 in the postintervention cohort. In the postintervention cohort , the mean ( SD) time from sepsis<disease> onset to empirical antibiotic therapy was lower ( 2.0 ( 2.7) vs. 2.5 ( 3.6) h; p = 0.002) , the proportion of inappropriate empirical treatments was lower ( 6.5 % vs. 8.9 %; p = 0.024) , and the proportion of patients in whom antibiotic treatment was de-escalated was higher ( 20.1 % vs. 16.3 %; p = 0.004); the expected reduction in mortality did not reach statistical significance ( 29.4 % in the postintervention cohort vs. 30.5 % in the preintervention cohort; p = 0.544). Gains observed after the intervention were maintained in the long-term follow-up period. Despite advances in sepsis<disease> treatment , educational interventions can still improve the delivery of care; further improvements might also improve outcomes.
