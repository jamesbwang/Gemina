  Childhood absence epilepsy ( CAE) is one of the most frequent epilepsies in infancy. The first-line recommended therapy for CAE is based on the prescription of the narrow-spectrum ethosuximide and the broad-spectrum valproic acid , which have similar efficacy in the first 12 months. Nevertheless , some antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs) may worsen seizure<symptom> duration and type in this syndrome<disease>. In line with this , we have encountered a case of identical twins with CAE and early exposure to different antiseizure drugs leading to divergent outcomes. From this , we hypothesized that the first AED to treat CAE may determine the long-term prognosis , especially in the developing brain , and that some situations leading to drug resistance may be explained by use of an inappropriate first AED. Therefore , we investigated this hypothesis by using a genetic mouse model of absence epilepsy ( BS/Orl). Mice received a first appropriate or inappropriate AED followed by the same appropriate AED. Our data demonstrate that an inappropriate first AED has a negative impact on the long-term efficacy of a second appropriate AED. This work supports the necessity to effectively diagnose epileptic syndromes<disease> prior to medication use , particularly in children , in order to prevent the deleterious effects of an inappropriate initial AED.
