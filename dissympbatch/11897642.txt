  The increased number of individuals older than 80 years , centenarians , and supercentenarians is not a synonym for healthy aging , since severe infections , hospitalization , and disability are frequently observed. In this context , a possible strategy is to preserve the main characteristics/functions of the immune system with the aim to cause less damage to the organism during the aging process. Vitamin D acts on bone<disease> marrow , brain , breast , malignant cells , and immune system and has been recommended as a supplement. We aimed to evaluate whether immune parameters and vitamin D serum levels are correlated. We evaluated some features of the immune system using the peripheral blood of individuals older than 80 years ( Old individuals presented metabolic parameters of healthy aging and maintained preserved some features of immunity such as CD4/CD8 ratio , and low<symptom> production<symptom> of pro-inflammatory cytokines after stimulus. On the other hand , we observed increase in the frequency of myeloid-derived suppressor cells , reduction in circulating leukocytes , in the percentage of total CD8 + , and in CD8 + Naïve T cells , in addition to increase in the percentage of CD8 + effector memory re-expressing CD45RA ( EMRA) T cells. We found seropositivity for CMV in 97.7 % , which was correlated with the decrease of CD8 + Naïve T cells and increase in CD8 + EMRA T cells. Vitamin D levels were insufficient in 50 % of old individuals and correlated positively with total CD8 + T cells and negatively with CD8 + EMRA T cells. In the studied population , longevity was correlated to maintenance of some immune parameters. Considering the limitations of the study as size of the sample and lack of functional assays , it was found that vitamin D in old individuals was correlated to some features of the immune system , mainly in the CD8 compartment.
