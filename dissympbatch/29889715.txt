  Chronic idiopathic urticaria ( CIU) , also known as chronic spontaneous urticaria , is characterized by the presence of hives<disease> on most days of the week , for 6 weeks or longer , and without an identifiable or consistent cause. Evaluation is clinical and based on the presence of episodic urticarial lesions<symptom>. Although patients are subject to overtesting during the diagnosis of CIU , guidelines suggest starting with three basic laboratory tests. Treatment is a stepwise approach , involving second-generation antihistamines , histamine2 antagonists , leukotriene receptor antagonists , first-generation antihistamines , and potent antihistamines. Refractory CIU requires adding alternative agents such as omalizumab , anti-inflammatory agents , and immunosuppressants.
