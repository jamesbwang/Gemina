  Periodontal and cardiovascular disease are both major health issues. Poor<symptom> oral health has long been associated with the development of systemic<disease> diseases<disease> , with the typical example being the risk of endocarditis<disease> posterior to dental procedures. Through the years , the association of periodontal<disease> disease<disease> with other non-infectious systemic<disease> diseases<disease> has been brought to attention. One of the most interesting associations is the one that exists with the development of cardiovascular disease. Many studies , including systematic reviews and meta-analyses , suggest an important association between periodontal<disease> disease<disease> and ischaemic heart disease , cerebrovascular disease , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> and peripheral artery disease. Among the proposed mechanisms of this relationship , systemic inflammation<symptom> appears to play a major role. Evidence suggests that periodontal inflammation<symptom> triggers a systemic inflammatory state that , added to the damage mediated by antibodies that cross react between periodontal pathogens and components of the intimal wall , and the direct lesion<symptom> of the intima by bacteria entering the circulation , promotes atheroma plaque development and progression. There are other studies that show a clear relationship between periodontal<disease> disease<disease> severity , elevations of inflammatory markers , and the presence of atherosclerosis. Here , we give a review of the available evidence supporting this association , and the possible mechanisms involved.
