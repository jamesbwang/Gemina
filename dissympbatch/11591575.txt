  Idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome<disease> ( ISCLS) is a very rare life-threatening disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of hypotension<symptom> , hemoconcentration , and hypoalbuminemia. It is caused by transient endothelial dysfunction , leading to plasma leakage from intravascular to interstitial space. Here , we report a case of ISCLS with recurrent episodes of capillary leak which required a long-term prophylaxis with beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist and theophylline. Although ISCLS is the rare entity , associated morbidity and mortality require physician 's awareness to provide timely therapy. Under-recognition in the medical community and rarity of this syndrome<disease> has precluded analysis in rational clinical trial designs that are necessary to determine targeted and adequate therapy. This report is meant to enhance awareness of ISCLS among physician 's community.
