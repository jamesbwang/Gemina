  Cutaneous eruption is a common drug-adverse reaction , characterised by keratinocytes inflammation<symptom> and apoptosis. Shuanghuanglian injeciton ( SHLI) is a typical Chinese medicine injection , which is used to treat influenza<disease> It has been reported that SHLI has the potential to induce cutaneous adverse eruptions. However , the mechanisms remain unclear. Since desmoglein 1 ( DSG1) shows a crucial role in maintaining skin barrier function and cell susceptibility , we assume that DSG1 plays a critical role in the cutaneous eruptions induced by SHLI. In our study , retinoic acid ( RA) was selected to downregulate the DSG1 expression , and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) was first used to identify the susceptibility of the DSG1-deficiency Hacat cells. Then , SHLI was administrated to normal or DSG1-deficient Hacat cells and mice. The inflammatory factors and apoptosis rate were evaluated by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. The skin pathological morphology was observed by hematoxylin and eosin ( HE) staining. Our results show that treated only with SHLI could not cause IL-4 and TNF- & alpha; mRNA increases in normal Hacat cells. However , in the DSG1-deficient Hacat cells or mice , SHLI induced an extreme increase of IL-4 and TNF- & alpha; mRNA levels , as well as in the apoptosis rate. The skin tissue showed a local inflammatory cell infiltration when treated with SHIL in the DSG1-deficient mice. Thus , we concluded that DSG1 deficiency was a potential causation of SHLI induced eruptions. These results indicated that keratinocytes with DSG1 deficiency were likely to induce the cutaneous eruptions when stimulated with other medicines.
