  This chapter summarizes the neuropathologic features of nonneoplastic disorders of the adult cerebellum. Gait ataxia<symptom> and extremity dysmetria are clinical manifestations of diseases that interrupt the complex cerebellar circuitry between the neurons of the cerebellar cortex , the cerebellar nuclei ( especially the dentate nuclei) , and the inferior olivary nuclei. The cerebellum is a prominent target of several sporadic and hereditary neurodegenerative diseases , including multiple system atrophy , spinocerebellar ataxia<symptom> , and Friedreich ataxia<symptom> Purkinje cells display selective vulnerability to hypoxia but a surprising resistance to hypoglycemia. A classic toxin that damages the cerebellar cortex is methylmercury , but the most common injurious agent to Purkinje cells is ethanol. Many drugs cause ataxia<symptom> , but doubts continue about phenytoin. Ischemic lesions<symptom> of the cerebellum due to arterial thrombosis or embolism cause a spectrum of symptoms and signs , depending on the territory involved. Large hemorrhages<symptom> have an unfavorable prognosis because they displace critical brainstem structures or penetrate into the fourth ventricle. Fungal infections and toxoplasmosis<disease> of the cerebellum , and cerebellar progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy , have become rarer because of improved control of the acquired immunodeficiency<disease> syndrome<disease>. Ataxia<symptom> is a prominent feature of prion disease. Adult-onset Niemann-Pick type C1 disease and Kufs disease may have a predominantly ataxic clinical phenotype. The adult cerebellum is also vulnerable to several leukodystrophies. A rare but widely recognized complication of cancer is paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration.
