  Many efforts have been undertaken to construct an overview of various aspects of illicit drug distribution in the United Kingdom. Yet given that national , regional , and local differences can be profound , this has proven difficult , to the extent that Scotland has been largely excluded from the conversation. In addition , the level of supply being examined , the drug type , and the actors involved only add to confusion<symptom> and vast differences between some findings. The current study aims to provide a holistic account , as best as possible considering variations of illegal drug supply in illicit networks , by focusing in on a particular geographical context ( Scotland) and addressing drug supply at all levels. It is informed by in-depth interviews with 42 offenders involved in drug distribution from retail to wholesale/middle market to importation levels. Findings indicate Scotland 's importation and distribution is evolving owing to increasingly adaptive risk mitigation by importers and distributors , and market diversification of both product and demand. While a hierarchical model still dominates the market , commuting or ` county lines ' and increasing demand for drugs such as cannabis , but also anabolic steroids and psychoactive substances , means that home growing , online purchasing , and street-level dealership is common. The findings have the capacity to further inform police and practitioners about the diverse and evolving nature of drug distribution in Scotland ( with a particular focus on the west<disease> of the country) , so that they may become more effective in improving the safety and wellbeing of people , places and communities.
