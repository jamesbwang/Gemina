  Colorectal carcinogenesis is a progressive multistep process involving the sequential accumulation of genetic alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. Down regulated by oncogenes 1 ( Dro1/Ccdc80) has been shown to be a potent tumor suppressor of colorectal carcinogenesis in the genetic ApcMin/ + mouse model. In ApcMin/ + mice loss of DRO1 strongly increases colonic tumor multiplicity and leads to the regular formation of adenocarcinoma in the colon. To investigate DRO1 ` s role in chemically induced as well as inflammation-associated colorectal carcinogenesis the effect of Dro1 inactivation was studied in mice subjected to the carcinogen azoxymethane ( AOM) and upon combined treatment with AOM and the proinflammatory agent dextran sodium sulfate ( DSS) , respectively. Loss of DRO1 increases multiplicity of preneoplastic aberrant crypt foci and colonic tumors upon administration of AOM. Combined treatment with AOM and DSS leads to increased colonic tumor number and promotes formation of adenocarcinoma in the colon. Moreover , Dro1 inactivation aggravates histological signs of acute and chronic DSS induced colitis<disease> , strongly enlarges the size of ulcerative lesions<symptom> in the intestinal lining , and exacerbates clinical signs and morbidity by DSS. Our results demonstrate DRO1 to be a strong tumor suppressor in the chemically induced colon carcinogenic mouse model. Additionally , we demonstrate DRO1 to inhibit colitis-associated colon cancer formation and uncover a novel putative role for DRO1 in inflammatory bowel disease.
