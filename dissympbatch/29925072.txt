  Recent experiments using optogenetic tools allow the identification and functional analysis of thirst neurons and vasopressin producing neurons. Two major advances provide a detailed anatomy of taste for water and arginine-vasopressin ( AVP) release: ( 1) thirst and AVP release are regulated not only by the classical homeostatic , intero-sensory plasma osmolality negative feedback , but also by novel , extero-sensory , anticipatory signals. These anticipatory signals for thirst and vasopressin release converge on the same homeostatic neurons of circumventricular organs that monitor the composition of the blood; ( 2) acid-sensing taste receptor cells ( which express polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1 protein) on the tongue that were previously suggested as the sour taste sensors also mediate taste responses to water. The tongue has a taste for water. The median preoptic nucleus ( MnPO) of the hypothalamus could integrate multiple thirst-generating stimuli including cardiopulmonary signals , osmolality , angiotensin II , oropharyngeal<disease> and gastric signals , the latter possibly representing anticipatory signals. Dehydration<symptom> is aversive and MnPO neuron activity is proportional to the intensity of this aversive state.
