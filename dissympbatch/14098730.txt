  BACKGROUND Appendiceal neoplasms are rare and generally determined in appendectomy specimens for acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease>. Depending on a tumor 's histopathology and size , appendectomy or right hemicolectomy are the surgical treatment options. Adenocarcinomas , mucinous neoplasms , goblet cell carcinoids and neuroendocrine tumors are the types of the primary appendiceal neoplasm histopathology. In this study , we aimed to determine the incidence of appendiceal neoplasms in an acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> cohort. Also , histopathological distributions , demographic data , preoperative radiological diagnosis , and intraoperative findings were revealed for analysis , retrospectively. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between October 2011 and September 2017 , 3554 appendectomies were performed for acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> in Bezmialem University Hospital , Istanbul Turkey. The medical records of these consecutive 3554 patients were evaluated retrospectively. After the histopathological analysis of the appendectomy specimens , a total of 28 patients were detected as having appendiceal neoplasm including appendiceal adenocarcinoma , low grade mucinous neoplasia , and appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors. RESULTS Appendiceal neoplasms were determined in 28 out of 3554 acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> patients with an incidence of 0.78 %. According to the histopathological types , 3 of the cases ( 10.7 %) were appendiceal adenocarcinoma , 8 of the cases ( 28.5 %) were low grade mucinous neoplasia , and 17 of the cases ( 60.8 %) were neuroendocrine tumors. The overall incidence of the appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors was 0.48 %. CONCLUSIONS The information obtained from our study suggests that pathological examination of the specimen may not be necessary if there is no doubt according to preoperative radiological diagnosis and/or intraoperative findings of the surgeon.
