  Sheehan 's syndrome<disease> ( SS) is one of the leading causes of hypopituitarism in developing countries. It occurs after postpartum necrosis<symptom> of the pituitary gland , and it is considered a significant public health problem. This paper , apparently unpublished , aimed to perform an analysis on oral aspects in patients with SS. A cross-sectional study was performed with 23 women diagnosed with SS at the Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes ( Walter Cantidio University Hospital , Fortaleza , Brazil). Data on sociodemographic , dental and salivary flow aspects were collected through a clinical approach and a panoramic radiograph request. The mean age was 64 ± 11.5 years old , with the sample consisting mainly of married women ( 56.5 %) , socioeconomic class C2 or D/ E ( 78.2 %) and years of education up to 8 years ( 69.5 %). The presence of horizontal bone loss ( p < 0.001) and bilateral pneumatization of the maxillary sinus ( p = 0.015) were significant data. The mean number of absent teeth considering all subjects was 23.17 ± 9.7 , being statistically significant ( p < 0.001). In relation to age , the mean number of missing teeth was higher in individuals over 65 years old ( p = 0.048). Reduced salivary flow was observed in 78.3 % of the patients. In a bivariate analysis , considering the outcome variables missing teeth and reduced salivary flow , it was observed that economic class ( p < 0.001) , family income ( 0.037) and maxillary sinus pneumatization ( 0.032) were statistically significant. In brief , patients with SS showed severe teeth loss , reduced salivary flow , and low educational status. This study addressed important aspects regarding oral findings in SS and highlighted the importance of researches in oral medicine.
