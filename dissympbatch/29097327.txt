  Gallic acid is a trihydroxybenzoic acid found in tea leaves and some plants. Here , we report the effect of gallic acid on cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis<disease> in a mouse model of pressure overload-induced heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and in primary rat cardiac fibroblasts , and compare the effects of gallic acid with those of drugs used in clinics. Gallic acid reduces cardiac hypertrophy , dysfunction , and fibrosis<disease> induced by transverse aortic constriction ( TAC) stimuli in vivo and transforming growth factor β1 ( TGF-β1) in vitro. It decreases left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter , and recovers the reduced fractional shortening in TAC. In addition , it suppresses the expression of atrial natriuretic peptide , brain natriuretic peptide , skeletal α-actin , and β-myosin heavy chain. Administration of gallic acid decreases perivascular fibrosis<disease> , as determined by Trichrome II Blue staining , and reduces the expression of collagen type I and connective tissue growth factor. However , administration of losartan , carvedilol , and furosemide does not reduce cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis<disease> in TAC. Moreover , treatment with gallic acid inhibits fibrosis-related genes and deposition of collagen type I in TGF-β1-treated cardiac fibroblasts. These results suggest that gallic acid is a therapeutic agent for cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis<disease> in
