  To document what types of gastrointestinal sequelae were described after surgery for necrotising enterocolitis<disease> ( NEC) and to analyse their frequency. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Medline , EMBASE and the Cochrane library ( CENTRAL) from 1990 to October 2016. We included studies , which provided original data on the occurrence of gastrointestinal sequelae in patients surviving surgery for NEC. Meta-analysis and metaregression to assess heterogeneity were performed for studies including 10 or more patients with gastrointestinal strictures , recurrence of NEC , intestinal<symptom> failure<symptom> ( IF) and adhesion ileus. Altogether 58 studies , including 4260 patients , met the inclusion criteria. Strictures were reported to occur in 24 % ( 95 % CI 17 % to 31 %) of surviving patients , recurrence of NEC in 8 % ( 95 % CI 3 % to 15 %) , IF in 13 % ( 95 % CI 7 % to 19 %) and adhesion ileus in 6 % ( 95 % CI 4 % to 9 %). Strictures were more common following enterostomy ( 30 %; 95 % CI 23 % to 37 %) than after primary anastomosis ( 8 %; 95 % CI 0 % to 23 %) and occurred more often after enterostomy without bowel resection than with bowel resection. We found considerable heterogeneity in the weighted average frequency of all sequelae ( I Gastrointestinal sequelae in neonates surviving surgery for NEC are frequent. Long-term follow-up assessing defined gastrointestinal outcomes is warranted.
