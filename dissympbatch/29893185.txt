  Carbon monoxide ( CO) poisoning<disease> , the most frequent type of poisoning<disease> , alters hemodynamics and creates tissue hypoxia that ultimately leads to thromboembolism. We herein describe a previously healthy 17-year-old male patient who developed acute CO poisoning<disease> while bathing in the same room as a gas heater. He was first treated with urokinase thrombolytic therapy at a local hospital , which proved ineffective. The patient was admitted to our hospital with unstable circulation and was diagnosed with massive pulmonary embolism combined with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome<disease>. His Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 22 , and his Sequential Organ<symptom> Failure<symptom> Assessment score was 15. We faced a difficult decision regarding whether to perform surgical embolectomy or to repeat the thrombolysis. We opted to repeat the thrombolysis with successful results. Our experience may help clinicians manage similar cases in the future.
