  The human DNA repair enzyme MUTYH excises mispaired adenine residues in oxidized DNA. Homozygous MUTYH mutations underlie the autosomal , recessive cancer syndrome<disease> MUTYH-associated polyposis. We report a MUTYH variant , p.C306W ( c. 918C > G) , with a tryptophan residue in place of native cysteine , that ligates the ( 4Fe4S) cluster in a patient with colonic polyposis and family history of early age colon cancer. In bacterial MutY , the ( 4Fe4S) cluster is redox active , allowing rapid localization to target lesions<symptom> by long-range , DNA-mediated signalling. In the current study , using DNA electrochemistry , we determine that wild-type MUTYH is similarly redox-active , but MUTYH C306W undergoes rapid oxidative degradation of its cluster to ( 3Fe4S)
