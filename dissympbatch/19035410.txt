  BACKGROUND Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) has myriad manifestations that can affect any organ system in the body. Macrophage activation syndrome<disease> ( MAS) is a disease of uncontrolled lymphocyte<symptom> and macrophage proliferation and activation , which has various triggers , including autoimmune disorder , viral<disease> infection<disease> , and malignancy. We report here on MAS as a complication of adult SLE , a rare association in the literature , in a patient with an unknown past medical history. CASE REPORT A 38-year-old male patient presented with severe<symptom> muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> , diffuse abdominal<disease> cramps<disease> with vomiting and incontinence of stool<symptom> , confusion<symptom> , cough<symptom> , and sweating increasing in severity for about 1 week. He was unable to give a coherent history and according to his family had been released from prison 3 weeks prior , having been in the corrections system for much of his adult life. The diagnosis of new-onset fulminant SLE complicated by MAS was made , noting the profound degree of bone<disease> marrow involvement , neuropsychiatric changes , and hyperferritinemia. CONCLUSIONS Many of the symptoms , signs , and laboratory findings of SLE overlap with those of MAS , and concomitant presence of both of these disease poses unique diagnostic challenges as well as extreme risk to the patient. A robust set of criteria for identifying MAS in the setting of a confounding underlying rheumatological illness does not exist in the adult population; this case illustrates the approach taken by our team to come to this diagnosis.
