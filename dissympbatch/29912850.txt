  The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in insular cortex metabolites and the correlation with clinical manifestations in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome<disease> ( OSA). Lateral insular metabolite levels were measured and relevant ratios were calculated in OSA patients and healthy individuals , including N-acetyl aspartate/creatine ( NAA/Cr) , choline/creatine ( Cho/Cr) , inositol/creatine ( Ins/Cr) , glutamate compound/creatine ( Glx/Cr) , N-acetyl aspartate/choline ( NAA/Cho) , and lactic acid ( Lac). Participants ' scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale ( HAMA) , the Hamilton Depression<symptom> Scale ( HAMD) , the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI) , and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS) were also evaluated. Apnea-Hypopnea Index , the lowest arterial oxygen saturation , and the mean arterial oxygen saturation ( MSaO2) values were monitored by polysomnography. NAA/Cr , Glx/Cr , and NAA/Cho values in the insular cortex were significantly decreased , whereas HAMA , HAMD , PSQI , and ESS scores were significantly higher in OSA patients compared with the control participants. HAMA and HAMD scores showed a significant negative correlation with the NAA/Cho value in the insular cortex and a positive correlation with PSQI and ESS scores. PSQI scores were correlated positively with the Cho/Cr and Ins/Cr ratios in the left insular cortex , but correlated negatively with the NAA/Cho ratio. The symptoms of anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> in OSA patients may be associated with insular neuron damage or dysfunction; proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy can provide an objective imaging basis for the early diagnosis and treatment of OSA in clinical practice.
