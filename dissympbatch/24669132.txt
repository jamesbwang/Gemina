  Penile injuries are not rare in children. Our aim is to establish their causes and to report our experience in the management of those accidents. A retrospective study of all penile injuries presented from January 2009 to January 2017 was performed. Hemorrhage<symptom> and excess of mucosa or skin remnants are the most frequent and benign injuries after circumcisions , so they were excluded from the study. Four groups were reported including the circumcision accident group , the traumatic accident group , the strangulation group and the electrocution group. The most frequent cause was circumcision accidents. We performed a penile re-implantation in one , and a glans re-implantation in another patient. Two patients underwent phalloplasty using the stumps of the remaining corpora cavernosa. We performed nine fistulae<disease> repair. Follow up showed healing without complication in the majority of the patients but recurrence of fistula<disease> was witnessed in four patients. Penile injuries are frequent with a challenging management. Most of the accidents can be prevented by improving conditions of circumcision.
