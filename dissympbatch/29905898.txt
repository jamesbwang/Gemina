  MINT1526A is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of integrin alpha 5 beta 1 ( α5β1) with its extracellular matrix ligands. This phase I study evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of MINT1526A with or without bevacizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. MINT1526A was administered every 3 weeks ( Q3W) as monotherapy ( arm 1) or in combination with bevacizumab 15 mg/kg , Q3W ( arm 2). Each arm included a 3 + 3 dose-escalation stage and a dose-expansion stage. Twenty-four patients were enrolled in arm 1 ( dose range 2-30 mg/kg) and 30 patients were enrolled in arm 2 ( dose range 3-15 mg/kg). Monocyte α5β1 receptor occupancy was saturated at a dose of 15 mg/kg. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed , and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached in either arm. The most common adverse events , regardless of causality , included abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> ( 25 %) , diarrhea<disease> ( 25 %) , nausea<symptom> ( 21 %) , vomiting<symptom> ( 21 %) , and fatigue<symptom> ( 21 %) in arm 1 and nausea<symptom> ( 40 %) , fatigue<symptom> ( 33 %) , vomiting<symptom> ( 30 %) , dehydration<symptom> ( 30 %) , headache<symptom> ( 30 %) , and hypertension ( 30 %) in arm 2. No grade ≥ 3 bleeding events were observed in either arm. No confirmed partial responses ( PR) were observed in arm 1. In arm 2 , one patient with thymic carcinoma experienced a confirmed PR and two patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) experienced durable minor radiographic responses. MINT1526A , with or without bevacizumab , was well-tolerated. Preliminary evidence of combination efficacy , including in patients with HCC , was observed , but can not be distinguished from bevacizumab monotherapy in this phase I study.
