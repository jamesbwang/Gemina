  Goblet cell carcinoids ( GCCs) of the appendix are rare mucinous neoplasms , for which optimal therapy is poorly described. We examined prognostic clinical and treatment factors in a population-based cohort. Patients diagnosed with GCC from 1984 to 2014 were identified from the British Columbia Cancer Agency and the Vancouver Lower<symptom> Mainland Pathology Archive. Of 88 cases with confirmed appendiceal GCCs , clinical data were available in 86 cases ( annual population incidence: 0.66/ 1,000,000). Median age was 54 years ( range 25-91) and 42 patients ( 49 %) were male. Metastasis at presentation was the strongest predictor of overall survival ( OS) , with median OS not reached for stage I-III patients , and measuring 16.2 months ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 9.1-29) for stage IV patients. In 67 stage I-III patients , 51 ( 76 %) underwent completion hemicolectomy and 9 ( 17 %) received adjuvant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. No appendicitis<disease> at initial presentation and Tang B histology were the only prognostic factors , with inferior 5-year recurrence-free survival ( 53 vs. 83 % with appendicitis<disease> , p = 0.02; 45 % Tang B vs. 89 % Tang A , p < 0.01). Of 19 stage IV patients , 10 ( 62.5 %) received 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and 11 ( 61 %) underwent multiorgan resection ( MOR) ± hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC). Low mitotic rate and MOR ± HIPEC were associated with improved 2-year OS , but only MOR ± HIPEC remained significant on multivariate analysis ( hazard ratio 5.4 , 95 % CI 1.4-20.9; p = 0.015). In this population-based cohort , we demonstrate excellent survival outcomes in stage I-III appendiceal GCCs and clinical appendicitis<disease> Hemicolectomy remains the standard treatment. In metastatic disease , outcomes remain poor , although MOR ± HIPEC may improve survival.
