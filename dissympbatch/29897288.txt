  Kidney injury and sleep apnea ( SA) are independent risk factors for hypertension. Exposing rats to intermittent hypoxia ( IH) to simulate SA increases blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> while adenine feeding causes persistent kidney damage to model chronic kidney disease ( CKD). We hypothesized that exposing CKD rats to IH would exacerbate the development of hypertension and renal<symptom> failure<symptom>. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a 0.2 % adenine or control diet until blood urea nitrogen ( BUN) was > 120 mg/dL in adenine fed rats ( 14 ( plus minus) 4 days). After two weeks recovery on normal chow , rats were exposed to IH ( 20 exposures/hr of 5 % O2/5 % CO2 7 hr/day) or control conditions for six weeks. Mean arterial pressure ( MAP) was monitored with telemeters and plasma and urine samples were collected weekly to calculate creatinine clearance as an index of glomerular filtration rate ( GFR). Prior to IH , adenine-fed rats had higher blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> than rats on control diet. IH treatment increased MAP in both groups and after six weeks MAP in the CKD/IH rats > CKD/Air rats = Control/IH rats > Control/Air rats. Kidney histology revealed crystalline deposits , tubule dilation and interstitial fibrosis<disease> in both CKD groups. IH caused no additional kidney damage. Plasma creatinine was similarly increased in both CKD groups throughout while IH alone increased plasma creatinine. IH increases blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> further in CKD rats without augmenting declines in GFR but appears to impair GFR in healthy rats. We speculate treating SA might decrease hypertension development in CKD patients and protect renal function in SA patients.
