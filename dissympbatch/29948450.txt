  To evaluate the efficacy of laser fibrotomy in patients with oral submucous fibrosis<disease> ( OSMF) and also to correlate the habit variables causing OSMF. Thirty patients diagnosed clinically and histopathologically with OSMF were included in the study. Laser fibrotomy was done under local anesthesia using Zolar diode laser ( 980 nm frequency) at 2-W power in contact mode with fibro-optic cutting tip. The patients were advised to practice mouth-opening exercises rigorously , and topical corticosteroid was given for burning sensation and pain for 6 months. Pre- and post-treatment comparison of mouth<symptom> opening , burning sensation , tongue protrusion , and cheek flexibility was analyzed after a follow-up period of 9 months. After a follow-up period of 9 months from the surgical intervention , the mean value of difference in pre- and post-treatment of VAS score , mouth<symptom> opening , and tongue protrusion was found to be 3.3 ± 2.1 , 7.7 ± 5.1 , 1.6 ± 2.7 , and 0.38 ± 0.61 respectively. Using the Wilcoxon signed rank test , all the above difference in mean was found to be significant with p value < 0.05. With above suggested significant results , lasers can provide an alternative and better means for surgical fibrotomy , relieving trismus in moderate OSMF as they are minimally invasive , cause less hemorrhage<symptom> , and have faster healing and minimal surgical site scaring and relapse.
