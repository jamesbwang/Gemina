  Deltamethrin can be absorbed into the respiratory<disease> tract<symptom> , the gastrointestinal tract and through the skin. The study was designed to assess the effect of deltamethrin on electrophysiological parameters of rabbit 's skin , studied in vitro , to identify the mechanism of action and effects of short-term dermal exposure to deltamethrin. The objective of the study was to investigate changes in electrophysiological parameters after exposure to 0.01 M deltamethrin under unchanged conditions , in the presence of amiloride ( sodium transport blocker) and bumetanide ( chloride transport blocker). Exposure to deltamethrin reduced the electrophysiological reaction of examined tissue in unchanged conditions and during the sodium reabsorption phase but did not influence the chloride ion secretion phase. The presented data show that the pyrethroide affects transepithelial ion transport in the external layers of the skin. The inhibition of chloride and sodium ions enabled evaluation of the impact of the pesticide on dermal transport.
