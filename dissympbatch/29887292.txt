  Klippel-Feil Syndrome<disease> is a disease characterised by congenital fusion of cervical vertebra , which leads to cervical limitation and instability. In these cases , the best option is the orotracheal intubation with the fibre-optic bronchoscope with the patient awake. The advantage is that cervical movements that could lead to neurological damage are minimised. In these patients , adequate sedation , together with instillation of local anaesthetic in the pharynx and hypopharynx , is the key to reducing patient discomfort and achieving successful orotracheal intubation. Dexmedetomidine is a selective α2- adrenergic receptor agonist that produces sedation and analgesia at the locus coeruleus without producing respiratory<symptom> depression<symptom> , as well as maintaining patient collaboration. The case is presented of a patient with Klippel-Feil Syndrome<disease> and difficult airway management , who was given a dexmedetomidine infusion at 0.6 μg/kg/h as sedation for an awake fibre-optic endotracheal intubation.
