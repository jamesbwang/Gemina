  Stevens-Johnson syndrome<disease> ( SJS)/ toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN)- like lupus erythematosus is a hyperacute and life-threatening form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Because of its rarity , little is known about this entity. We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics , laboratory findings , systemic manifestations , treatments , and outcome of SJS/ TEN-like lupus erythematosus. We conducted a chart review study from July 2002 to September 2016 of all patients diagnosed with SJS/TEN-like lupus erythematosus who presented with gradual epidermal necrolysis without clear drug or infectious culprit. We evaluate for clinical features , extracutaneous involvement , Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index , histologic findings , immunofluorescence pattern , serologic abnormalities , treatment , outcome , and recurrence of SJS/TEN-like lupus erythematosus. Of 9074 patients diagnosed with cutaneous lupus erythematosus and/or systemic lupus erythematosus , 6 patients justified the diagnosis of SJS/TEN-like lupus erythematosus ( 5 SJS/TEN-like acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus , 1 TEN-like subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus) , accounting for 0.07 %. Fifty percent had epidermal necrolysis as the initial presentation of lupus with a median time from onset of 1.5 months ( 0-48 months). The median duration between initial rash<symptom> and epidermal detachment was 4.5 days ( 3-14 days). All had internal organ involvement ( hematologic and renal) and high Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index score ( median , 19.5 ( 16-24)). Most recovered with systemic corticosteroids , antimalarial drugs , and/or immunosuppressants. None had disease recurrence. This is the largest single series of patients with SJS/TEN-like lupus erythematosus. Skin damage is an indicator of disease activity , and careful search for extracutaneous involvement to prevent further complications is mandatory.
