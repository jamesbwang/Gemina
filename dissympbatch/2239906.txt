  Although acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> is one of the most common surgical emergencies worldwide , timely accurate diagnosis is always difficult for a surgeon even after availability of recent diagnostic tools. Our study is to determine validation of RIPASA score in diagnosis of acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> and histopathological correlation. A prospective study of 200 patients presented to emergency or surgical opd with right iliac fossa pain and suspected to have acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> were included in our study. RIPASA score calculated but appendectomy done on the basis of clinical assessment and hospital protocol and histopathological correlation done with a score. A score of 7.5 is cut off threshold , results compared with previous studies. In our study of 200 patients , M: F ratio of 1.56:1. Sensitivity of the RIPASA score was 95.89 â„… with specificity 75.92 % and diagnostic accuracy of 90.5 % , expected and observed rate of negative appendectomy were 8.5 and 12.35 % , respectively. So there is net reduction in negative appendectomy rate by 3.85 %. Data analysis done with Statistical Package for Social Science ( SPSS) version 21.0. RIPASA score at a cutoff value of 7.5 is easier , cheap , and better diagnostic tool in equivocal case of right iliac fossa pain in Indian scenario of limited availability of recent diagnostic tool in remote areas and affordability of these tool in the available set up , simultaneously , it also helps to reduce negative appendectomy rates.
