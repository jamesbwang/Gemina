  Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome<disease> is a disorder of sleep breathing that is a result of recurrent and intermittent hypoxia during sleep induced by the repeated partial or complete collapse of the upper airway , eventually causing chronic intermittent hypoxia. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is divided into non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Animal and human studies showed that obesity is associated with chronic liver hypoxia , even in the presence of systemic normoxia causing inflammation<symptom> and release of cytokines. A `` two-hit '' model has been proposed. The first hit is characterized by insulin resistance and excess hepatic lipid accumulation secondary to abnormal fatty acid metabolism. Oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom> are thought to comprise the second hit. Gold standard for the diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is a liver biopsy. Many clinical scores and non-invasive tools are used for the diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Conservative management with lifestyle modifications including diet , exercise and weight<symptom> loss<symptom> remains the therapy of choice today. We present a case report of a 39-year-old man who was diagnosed with concomitant non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and severe obstructive sleep apnea. He was started treatment with continuous positive airway pressure and demonstrated excellent adherence to therapy for 6 years , with concomitant obstructive sleep apnea and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis which reversed with prolonged optimal continuous positive airway pressure therapy. Physical examination remained unremarkable except for morbid obesity. His abdominal girth , as well as body mass index , remained unchanged. After 6 years of optimal continuous positive airway pressure therapy , liver enzymes and relevant lipid panel normalized , suggesting reversal of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.
