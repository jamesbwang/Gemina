  Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor ( IMT) can occur rarely in the soft tissue or joint of the limb. We retrospectively collected IMT cases of these rare sites and analyzed their clinical and imaging appearance. Thirteen cases of IMT were clinically diagnosed and underwent surgical procedures , pathological analyses , and postsurgical follow-up in our two hospitals. Other than one case of IMT of the bladder wall that presented with gross hematuria<symptom> , none presented with local swelling , fever<disease> , or weakness<symptom>. All the cases of IMT occurring at the bone showed destruction and parosteal soft tissue masses. The boundaries between the mass and normal bone were vague , without calcifications or any periosteal reaction. Five cases of IMF showed continuous enhancement on CT; seven cases demonstrated iso- or hyposignal intensity on T1WI; one case showed hypersignal intensity on T1WI , and eight cases demonstrated a hypersignal intensity signal on T2WI. All the masses located in soft tissues showed clear and sharp boundaries with different sizes of the swelling regions surrounding muscle interspaces. Three cases showed homogeneous enhancement , one case demonstrated heterogeneous enhancement , and two cases showed edge enhancement on enhanced MRI scans. On pathology , all the lesions<symptom> showed an absence of a pseudocapsule , and four cases of ALK were positive. The radiological manifestations of IMT located at the soft tissue and bones were similar to benign tumors in shape; however , peritumoral edema<symptom> , parosteal soft tissue , and the invasive rim of IMT are similar to the features of malignant tumors. Different radiological methods should be used to obtain an accurate diagnosis.
