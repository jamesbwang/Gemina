  The study aims to investigate how mothers ' oral health behaviour and perception thereof influence the dental health in their children. A total of 556 Vietnamese mother-child pairs participated in the current study. Mothers self-reported their oral status and oral health behaviour and perception. Dental<disease> caries<disease> of the children were examined using the index of decayed , missing , and filled teeth. The Dental Anxiety<symptom> Scale instrument was used to assess the dental anxiety<symptom> level in mothers and children. Among mothers , 41.3 % had gingival bleeding , 40 % perceived their dentition and gingival status to be at a good level , 68 % brushed their teeth more than twice a day , and 17 % had never visited a dentist. Mothers ' oral health behaviour and their perception thereof were positively correlated with their frequency of dental visits ( Maternal oral health was significantly associated with dental health of their children. Not only did maternal dental anxiety<symptom> influence oral health of mothers but it was also a concomitant factor in the development of children 's dental anxiety<symptom>. The education programme on mothers ' oral health-related knowledge can be a target for improvement of the oral health of mothers and children.
