  Background/aim: Various studies have shown that adult patients with polycystic ovary syndrome<disease> ( PCOS) have higher levels of anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> compared to their normal counterparts. However , it is still unclear whether these mood disorders already exist in adolescents affected by PCOS. The aim of the present study is to assess differences in anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> levels between adolescents with PCOS and age- and body mass index ( BMI)- matched controls and to determine the possible factor ( s) impacting these psychological parameters in adolescents with PCOS. Materials and methods: The study included 80 adolescents with PCOS and 50 age- and BMI-matched controls. All participants completed standardized questionnaires assessing anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> A multiple linear regression model was used to analyze the impact of potential variables on anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> scores of the adolescents with PCOS. Results: Significantly higher levels of anxiety<symptom> , specifically generalized and social anxieties , as well as depression<symptom> were found in adolescents with PCOS compared to controls. Higher BMI was found to be associated with higher levels of depression<symptom> and generalized anxiety<symptom> , and higher modified Ferriman-Gallwey score with higher level of panic disorder in adolescents affected by PCOS. Conclusion: Adolescents with PCOS experience significantly more emotional distress compared to adolescents without PCOS. This emotional distress may be related , at least in part , to certain clinical features of PCOS including obesity and hirsutism. PCOS in adolescents should be assessed not only for the gynecological and metabolic aspects but also for the emotional aspects of the disease.
