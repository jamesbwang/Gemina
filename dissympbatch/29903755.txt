  There is no accurate , non-invasive measurement to estimate the degree of pulmonary oedema in acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> ( ARDS). We developed the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Oedema ( RALE) score to evaluate the extent and density of alveolar opacities on chest radiographs. After first comparing the RALE score to gravimetric assessment of pulmonary oedema in organ donors , we then evaluated the RALE score in patients with ARDS for its relationship to oxygenation and clinical outcomes. We compared radiographs with excised lung weights from 72 organ donors ( derivation cohort) and radiographs with clinical data from 174 patients with ARDS in the ARDSNet Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial ( validation cohort). To calculate RALE , each radiographic quadrant<symptom> was scored for extent of consolidation ( 0-4) and density of opacification ( 1-3). The product of the consolidation and density scores for each of the four quadrants was summed ( maximum score = 48). Agreement between two independent reviewers for RALE score was excellent ( intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.93 , 95 % CI 0.91 to 0.95). In donors , pre-procurement RALE score correlated with height-adjusted total lung weight ( œÅ = 0.59 , p < 0.001). In patients with ARDS , higher RALE scores were independently associated with lower PaO The RALE score can be used to assess both the extent of pulmonary oedema and the severity of ARDS , by utilising information that is already obtained routinely , safely and inexpensively in every patient with ARDS. This novel non-invasive measure should be useful for assessing ARDS severity and monitoring response to therapy.
