  To describe a case of acute glaucoma after cyanoacrylate gluing for a non-traumatic central corneal perforation. A 55-year-old woman with history of rheumatoid arthritis<disease> and severe<symptom> dry<symptom> eye presented to emergency with a right central corneal perforation. She was treated successfully with the use cyanoacrylate glue patch but iridocorneal adhesions remained. The next day she presented with ocular pain , headaches<symptom> and vomiting. On examination she had shallow anterior chamber with no aqueous leakage but her intraocular pressure was 56 â–’ mm Hg measured with rebound tonometry. An anterior segment OCT scan showed a 360 degrees central iris adhesion with shallow AC. Topical and oral treatment for acute glaucoma was given that decreased her intraocular pressure. She then underwent urgent surgery to release the iridocorneal adhesions and restore aqueous flow that was achieved without replacing the glue patch. One day postoperatively her right eye was comfortable and her IOP measurement remained within normal limits. The anterior chamber was deep with no iridocorneal adhesions. Close monitoring of the intraocular pressure is recommendable in central corneal perforations with iris adhesions managed with cyanoacrylate glue due to the potential developing of aqueous blockage.
