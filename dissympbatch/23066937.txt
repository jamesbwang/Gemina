  Gene mutations within the RAS-MAPK signaling cascade result in Noonan syndrome<disease> ( NS) , neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1) , and related disorders. Recent research has documented an increased risk for social difficulties and features of autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) among children with these conditions. Despite this emerging evidence , the neuropsychological characteristics associated with social skills deficits are not well understood , particularly for children with NS. Parents of children with NS ( n = 39) , NF1 ( n = 39) , and unaffected siblings ( n = 32) between the ages of 8 and 16 years were administered well-validated caregiver questionnaires assessing their child 's social skills , language abilities , attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) symptoms and anxiety<symptom>. With respect to overall social skills , average ratings of children in both clinical groups were similar , and indicated weaker social skills compared to unaffected siblings. Although ratings of social skills were outside of normal limits for more than four in ten children within the clinical groups , most of the deficits were mild/moderate. Fifteen percent of the children with NS and 5 % of the children with NF1 were rated as having severe social skills impairment ( <- 2SD). Independent of diagnosis , having fewer ADHD symptoms or better social-pragmatic language skills was predictive of stronger social skills. Amidst efforts to support social skill development among children and adolescents with RASopathies , neuropsychological correlates such as social language competence , attention , and behavioral self-regulation could be important targets of intervention.
