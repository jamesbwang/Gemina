  Understanding effects of Acute Smoke Exposure ( ASE) on airway epithelial gene expression and their relationship with the effects of Chronic Smoke Exposure ( CSE) may provide biological insights into the development of smoking-related respiratory<disease> diseases<disease>. Bronchial airway epithelial cell brushings were collected from 63 individuals without recent cigarette smoke exposure , before and 24-hours after smoking three cigarettes. RNA from these samples was profiled on Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST microarrays. We identified 91 genes differentially expressed 24-hours after ASE ( FDR < 0.25). ASE induced genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism , oxidative stress , and inflammation<symptom> and repressed genes related to cilium morphogenesis and cell cycle. While many genes altered by ASE are altered similarly in chronic smokers , metallothionein genes are induced by ASE and suppressed in chronic smokers. Metallothioneins are also suppressed in current and former smokers with lung cancer relative to those without lung cancer. Acute exposure to as little as three cigarettes and chronic smoking induce largely concordant changes in airway epithelial gene expression. Differences in short-term and long-term effects of smoking on metallothionein expression and their relationship to lung cancer requires further study given these enzymes ' role in the oxidative stress response.
