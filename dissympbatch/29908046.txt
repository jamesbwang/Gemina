  AKI is a common complication of sepsis<disease> and is significantly associated with mortality. Sepsis<disease> accounts for more than 50 % of the cases of AKI , with a mortality rate of up to 40 %. The pathogenesis of septic AKI is complex , but there is emerging evidence that , at least in the first 48 hours , the defects may be functional rather than structural in nature. For example , septic AKI is associated with an absence of histopathological changes , but with microvascular abnormalities and tubular stress. In this context , renal medullary hypoxia due to redistribution of intra-renal perfusion is emerging as a critical mediator of septic AKI. Clinically , vasopressor drugs remain the cornerstone of therapy for maintenance of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and organ perfusion. However , in septic AKI , there is insensitivity to vasopressors such as norepinephrine , leading to persistent hypotension<symptom> and organ<symptom> failure<symptom>. Vasopressin , angiotensin II , and , paradoxically , Î±
