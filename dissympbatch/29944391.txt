  ErbB4 , a member of the EGF receptor family , plays a variety of roles in physiologic and pathologic states. Genetic studies have indicated linkage of ErbB4 and type II diabetes and obesity , but its role in metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) has not been reported. In the current study , we found that compared to wild-type , mice with ErbB4 deletion developed MetS after 24 weeks on a medium-fat diet ( MFD) as indicated by development of obesity , dyslipidemia , hepatic steatosis , hyperglycemia , hyperinsulinemia , and insulin resistance. ErbB4 deletion mice also had increased amounts of subcutaneous and visceral fat with increased serum leptin levels , whereas levels of adiponectin were not significantly different. Histologically , severe<symptom> inflammation<symptom> , indicated by F4/80 immunostaining and M1 macrophage polarization , was detected in both inguinal white adipose tissue ( iWAT) and epididymal WAT ( eWAT) in ErbB4 deletion mice. ErbB4 expression decreased during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. Administration to 3T3-L1 adipocytes of NRG4 , a specific ligand for ErbB4 , had no effect on adipogenesis and lipolysis , but significantly inhibited lipogenesis , promoted browning , induced GLUT4 redistribution to cell membrane , and increased glucose uptake. NRG4 treatment also significantly increased glucose uptake in adipocytes isolated from wild-type mice , while those effects were significantly decreased in adipocytes isolated from ErbB4 deletion mice. In conclusion , our results indicate that ErbB4 may play an important role in glucose homeostasis and lipogenesis. ErbB4 deficiency-related obesity and adipose tissue inflammation<symptom> may contribute to the development of metabolic
