  Primary episodic ataxias<symptom> ( EAs) are a group of dominantly inherited disorders characterized by transient recurrent incoordination<symptom> and truncal instability , often triggered by physical exertion and emotional stress , variably associated with progressive baseline ataxia<symptom> There are now eight designated subtypes based largely on genetic loci. Mutations have been identified in multiple individuals and families with EA1 , EA2 , and EA6 , mostly with onset before adulthood. EA1 and EA2 are prototypical neurologic channelopathies. EA1 is caused by heterozygous mutations in KCNA1 , which encodes the α1 subunit of a neuronal voltage-gated potassium channel , Kv1 .1. EA2 , the most common and best characterized , is caused by heterozygous mutations in CACNA1A , which encodes the α1A subunit of a neuronal voltage-gated calcium channel , Cav2 .1. EA6 is caused by heterozygous mutations in SLC1A3 , which encodes a subunit of a glial excitatory amino acid transporter , EAAT1. The other EA subtypes were defined in single families awaiting gene identification and further confirmation. This chapter focuses on the best-characterized EA syndromes<disease> , the clinical assessment and genetic diagnosis of EA , and the management of EA , as well as newly recognized allelic disorders that have greatly expanded the clinical spectrum of EA2. Illustrative cases are discussed , with a focus on sporadic patients with congenital features without episodic ataxia<symptom> who present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.
