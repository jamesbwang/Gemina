  The prevalence of affective disorders such as depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> is particularly high in patients with autoimmune diseases , including inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis , atopic dermatitis<disease> , and hidradenitis suppurativa. A dysregulated immune response has been linked to the precipitation of depression<symptom> in many patient populations. However , studies examining the extent to which the underlying skin disease inflammatory processes contribute to depression<symptom> and a subsequent decline in quality of life are limited. The published literature over the past 5 years was reviewed for evidence of a relationship between depression<symptom> and inflammatory processes in the context of skin pathology. The findings , particularly the evidence from interventional clinical trials of targeted anti-cytokine therapies , suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with several skin diseases may be causally linked with the coexistent depressive symptomology.
