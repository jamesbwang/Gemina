  Schmidt 's syndrome<disease> , also known as poliglandular autoimmune syndrome<disease> type 2 , is a rare disease that has a prevalence between 1.5-4.5 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. The diagnosis consists in the concomitant presentation of Addison disease , autoimmune thyroid disease and other autoimmune endocrinological conditions. The aim of this paper is to describe a case of Schmidt 's syndrome<disease> in the peruvian context and to analyze the difficulties in the diagnosis. We present the case of a 43-year-old woman that presents to the emergency room with headache<symptom> , nausea<symptom> , vomits and a `` syncope episode ''. The patient had a history of secondary amenorrhea , Addison disease , hypothyroidism , osteoporosis and diabetes mellitus type 2. Physical exam showed hyperpigmentation , hypotension<symptom> and bradycardia<symptom>. Lab exams demonstrated leukocytosis , hyponatremia , hyperglycemia , and compensated metabolic alkalosis. The emergency management consisted on rehydration , corticoids and insulin. During the hospital stance , exams included follicle stimulation hormone increasement and vaginal echography determined uterine hypoplasia. The patient was discharged one month later with Schmidt 's syndrome<disease> , based on autoimmune thyroiditis , Addison 's disease and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism. In a two week later control , the patient was asymptomatic with levothyroxine , fluodrocortisone , estradiol and insulin treatment. In our context , Schmidt 's syndrome<disease> is a very rare disease , which leads to a late diagnosis and difficult management.
