  Fatty and hydroxycarboxylic acids are one of the main intermediates of energy metabolism in ruminants and critical in the milk<symptom> production<symptom> of cattle. High production demands on a dairy farm can induce nutritional imbalances and metabolism disorders , which have been widely associated with the onset of sterile inflammatory processes and increased susceptibility to infections. The literature suggests that short-chain fatty acids ( SCFA) , long-chain fatty acids ( LCFA) and hydroxycarboxylic acids are relevant modulators of the host innate inflammatory response. For instance , increased SCFA and lactate levels are associated with subacute ruminal acidosis ( SARA) and the activation of pro-inflammatory processes mediated by diverse leukocyte and vascular endothelial cells. As such , free LCFA and the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate are significantly increased in the plasma 1-2 weeks postpartum , coinciding with the time period in which cows are more susceptible to acquiring infectious<disease> diseases<disease> that the host innate immune system should actively oppose. Today , many of these pro-inflammatory responses can be related to the activation of specific G protein-coupled receptors , including GPR41/FFA3 and GPR43/FFA2 for SCFA; GPR40/FFA1 and GPR120/FFA4 for LCFA , GPR109A/HCA2 for ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate , and GPR81/HCA
