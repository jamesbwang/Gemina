  Wheat avoidance in the absence of celiac disease ( CD) is common but occurrence of concurrent functional gastrointestinal disorders ( FGIDs) in this group is uncertain. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of self-reported wheat or gluten sensitivity and doctor diagnosed CD in an Australian population , define the associated gastrointestinal ( GI) symptoms and FGIDs , and determine the relationship between self-reported wheat sensitivity , demographic and medical factors. A total of 3542 people randomly selected from the Australian population returned a mail survey which contained questions on wheat avoidance , GI symptoms , demographic , medical , and lifestyle factors. We defined self-reported wheat sensitivity as people who reported gastrointestinal symptoms on ingestion of wheat based foods , but did not suffer from celiac disease , inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer. Functional dyspepsia ( FD) and irritable bowel syndrome<disease> ( IBS) were diagnosed by Rome III criteria. CD status was self-reported. The prevalence of self-reported wheat sensitivity in this cohort was 14.9 % ( 95 % CI 13.7-16.2). The prevalence of CD was 1.2 % ( 95 % CI 0.8-1.6). Doctor diagnosed CD was significantly associated with a diagnosis of FD ( OR 3.35 , 95 % CI 1.72-6.52) and IBS ( OR 2.28 , 95 % CI 1.08-4.81). Those with self-reported wheat sensitivity were more likely to report multiple<symptom> abdominal<symptom> symptoms<symptom> ( of the 18 assessed) than those without ( 3.9 symptoms with self-reported wheat sensitivity vs. 1.6 without , p = 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis , self-reported wheat sensitivity was independently associated with IBS ( OR 3.55 , 95 % CI 2.71-4.65) and FD ( 1.48 , 95 % CI 1.13-1.94). Self-reported wheat sensitivity is common , with a prevalence of 14.9 % in this cohort. There is a strong association between both celiac disease and self-reported wheat sensitivity , and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms , as well as a diagnosis of FD and IBS.
