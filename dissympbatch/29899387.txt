  Although childhood cardiovascular risk can contribute to adult cardiovascular disease , and fertility and adult cardiovascular health are linked , the association between early-life cardiovascular risk and female infertility<symptom> has not been studied. A total of 1799 women participated in the Babies substudy of the Bogalusa Heart Study. Systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( DBP) , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) , high-density lipoprotein ( HDL) , triglycerides , glucose , and insulin were age-standardized and examined as predictors of self-reported fertility difficulties using multivariable logistic regression with adjustment for confounders. Polycystic ovarian syndrome<disease> ( PCOS) was assessed via a report of diagnosis and symptoms , using a validated questionnaire. Women with a history of PCOS were more likely to report fertility difficulties. Childhood and adolescent cardiovascular risk factors were generally not associated with fertility indicators , although childhood LDL ( aOR 1.38 per one-SD increase , 0.97-1.96) and total cholesterol ( aOR 1.49 , 1.06-2.11) were raised in those who never became pregnant. Pre-pregnancy risk SBP ( overall fertility , aOR 1.49 , 1.00-2.23) and glucose levels ( ever tried but unable , aOR 2.65 , 1.39-5.06) were associated with an increased risk of some infertility<symptom> indicators. These results were largely unaffected by exclusion of women with PCOS. Some childhood and pre-pregnancy cardiovascular risk factors are associated with adult subfertility.
