  The insulin/insulin-like growth factor/relaxin family represents a group of structurally related but functionally diverse proteins. The family member relaxin-2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for its efficacy in the treatment of acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. In this study , we assessed the role of insulin-like peptide 6 ( INSL6) , another member of this protein family , in murine heart<symptom> failure<symptom> models using genetic loss-of-function and protein delivery methods. Insl6-deficient and wild-type ( C57BL/6N) mice were administered angiotensin II or isoproterenol via continuous infusion with an osmotic pump or via intraperitoneal injection once a day , respectively , for 2 weeks. In both models , Insl6-knockout mice exhibited greater cardiac systolic dysfunction and left ventricular dilatation. Cardiac dysfunction in the Insl6-knockout mice was associated with more extensive cardiac fibrosis<disease> and greater expression of fibrosis-associated genes. The continuous infusion of chemically synthesized INSL6 significantly attenuated left ventricular systolic dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis<disease> induced by isoproterenol infusion. Gene expression profiling suggests liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor signaling is activated in the isoproterenol-challenged hearts treated with INSL6 protein. Endogenous Insl6 protein inhibits cardiac systolic dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis<disease> in angiotensin II- and isoproterenol-induced cardiac stress models. The administration of recombinant INSL6 protein could have utility for the treatment of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and cardiac
