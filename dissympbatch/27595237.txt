  Loss of endothelial integrity promotes capillary leakage in numerous diseases , including sepsis<disease> , but there are no effective therapies for preserving endothelial barrier function. Angiopoietin-2 ( ANGPT2) is a context-dependent regulator of vascular leakage that signals via both endothelial TEK receptor tyrosine kinase ( TIE2) and integrins. Here , we show that antibodies against β1-integrin decrease LPS-induced vascular leakage in murine endotoxemia , as either a preventative or an intervention therapy. β1-integrin inhibiting antibodies bound to the vascular endothelium in vivo improved the integrity of endothelial cell-cell junctions and protected mice from endotoxemia-associated cardiac failure , without affecting endothelial inflammation<symptom> , serum proinflammatory cytokine levels , or TIE receptor signaling. Moreover , conditional deletion of a single allele of endothelial β1-integrin protected mice from LPS-induced vascular leakage. In endothelial monolayers , the inflammatory agents thrombin , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) , and IL-1β decreased junctional vascular endothelial ( VE)- cadherin and induced actin stress fibers via β1- and α5-integrins and ANGPT2. Additionally , β1-integrin inhibiting antibodies prevented inflammation-induced endothelial cell contractility and monolayer permeability. Mechanistically , the inflammatory agents stimulated ANGPT2-dependent translocation of α5β1-integrin into tensin-1-positive fibrillar adhesions , which destabilized the endothelial monolayer. Thus , β1-integrin promotes endothelial barrier disruption during inflammation<symptom> , and targeting β1-integrin signaling could serve as a novel means of blocking pathological vascular leak.
