  Generalized morphea is associated with epoxy resin vapors and is characterized by the development of lesions<symptom> shortly after exposure. Morphea presenting along with eosinophilic fasciitis<disease> ( EF) , or morphea/EF overlap , is rare and an indicator of poor prognosis and resistance to treatment. Here we present a case of generalized morphea/EF overlap linked to epoxy exposure. Our patient received multiple therapies-ultraviolet A1 phototherapy , prednisone , methotrexate , azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , cyclophosphamide , cyclosporine , and rituximab-none of which led to a significant response. The refractory nature of this disease warrants vigilance in its association with epoxy exposure.
