  To observe the effect of Soyisoflavones ( SI) on the expression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway elements , transforming growth factor-β ( THGF-β) and its related proteins in the renal interstitia of diabetic nephropathic ( DN) rats , 48 DN rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: DN model group ( group DN) , soybean isoflavone treatment group ( group DA) , DN model group + losartan treatment group ( group DL) , DN model group + soybean isoflavones combined with losartan treatment group ( group SL). Each group comprised 12 rats. Twelve healthy Wistar rats were selected as normal controls ( group N). After 12 weeks of continuous administration of soybean isoflavone or losartan or those two combined , the body<symptom> weight of rats was recorded and serum urea nitrogen ( BUN) and creatinine ( Scr) were measured. The expression of Wnt4 , β-catenin , and TGF-β1 proteins , as well as mRNA , in the renal interstitium were detected by immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative PCR ( FQ-PCR). In all the groups , Wnt4 , β-catenin and TGF-β1 protein were only expressed in renal interstitial and renal tubular epithelial cells. There was no significant difference between group DA and group DL ( P > 0.05). FQ-PCR results showed that Wnt4 , β-catenin and TGF-β1 mRNA were consistent with the expression of these proteins in the renal tissue of each group. Soy isoflavones can reduce 24-h urinary protein quantification , alleviate renal interstitial pathological damage , and regulate the expression of Wnt4 , β-catenin and TGF-β1 in the renal interstitium. This suggests that soybean isoflavones could delay the process of renal interstitial fibrosis<disease> in DN rats by decreasing the expression of Wnt4 , β-catenin and TGF-β1 in the renal interstitium , thus demonstrating that soybean isoflavones plus losartan have the best protective effects against diabetes-induced renal
