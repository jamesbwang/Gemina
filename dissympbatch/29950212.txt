  To analyze the relationship between the early treatment response and the pregnosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( ALL). Two hundred and Seventy-eight ALL children diagnosed and treated in Hainan general hospital from March 2013 to March 2017 were collected. All ALL children received therapy with CCLg-ALL-2008 regimen. The 3 year event-free survival ( EFS) rate of ALL children in different groups was analyzed in terms of 4 indexes including sensitivity response to prednison at day 8 ( D8-SRP) , bone<disease> marrow remission at day 15 ( D15-BMR) and at day 33 ( D33-BMR) , and minimal residual disease at day 33 ( D33-BMR) , and minimal residual disease at day 33 ( D33-MRD). These 4 indexes and other indexes possibly affecting the prognosis of ALL children were enrolled in Cox regression model for analysis of independent factors affecting the prognosis of ALL children. The D8-SRP test showed that among 269 ALL children , 240 ( 89.22 %) cases displayed prednisone poor<symptom> response<symptom> ( PPR); the 3-year EFS rate in predrisone good response ( PGR) group was significantly higher than that in PPR group ( P < 0.05). The D15-BMR detection showed that among 262 ALL children , the bone<disease> marrow remission ( BMR) as M1 was observed in 230 cases ( 87.79 %) , M2 in 20 cases ( 7.63 %) and M3 in 9 cases ( 4.58 %); the 3-year EFS rate showed as follows: M1 group > M2 group > M3 group ( P < 0.05). The D33-BMR detection showed that among 257 ALL children , the BMR as M1 was observed in 227 cases ( 88.33 %) , M2 in 21 cses ( 8.17 %) and M3 in 9 caes ( 3.51 %); the 3-year EFS rate in 3 groups showed as follows: M1 group > M2 group > M3 group ( P < 0.05). The D33-MRD detection showed that among 185 ALL children , MRD < 10 The early treatment response can predict the prognosis of ALL children , which is an independent prognostic factor for ALL children.
