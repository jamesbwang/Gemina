  We have investigated the association between 4 cis- and trans-genetic variants ( rs6921438 , rs4416670 , rs6993770 and rs10738760) of the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) gene and metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) and its individual components in an Iranian population. Three hundred and thirty-six subjects were enrolled and MetS was defined according to the International-Diabetes-Federation ( IDF) criteria. Genotyping was carried out in all the individuals for 4 VEGF genetic variants using an assay based on a combination of multiplex polymerase chain reaction and biochip array hybridization. As may be expected , patients with MetS had significantly higher levels of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein , waist circumference , hip circumference , body mass index , fat percentage , systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and triglyceride , whereas the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly lower , compared to the control group ( P < 0.05). We also found that 1 of the VEGF- level associated genetic variants , rs6993770 , was associated with the presence of MetS; the less common T allele at this locus was associated with an increased risk for MetS. This association remained significant after adjustment for confounding factors ( P = 0.007). Individuals with MetS carrying the AT + TT genotypes had markedly higher levels of fasting blood glucose , triglyceride and systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( P < 0.05). We have found an association between the rs6993770 polymorphism and MetS. This gene variant was also associated with serum VEGF concentrations. There was also an association between this variant and the individual components of the MetS , including triglyceride , fasting blood glucose and systolic
