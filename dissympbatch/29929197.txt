  Craniofacial disharmony in skeletal diseases is strongly associated with sleep-disordered breathing. Our aim was to study sleep respiratory patterns in young children with rare skeletal disorders. This retrospective study included children with achondroplasia , osteogenesis imperfecta and Ellis van Creveld Syndrome<disease>. Our subjects underwent an in-laboratory overnight respiratory polygraph between January 2012 and April 2016. All medical records were reviewed and brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging was conducted on patients with achondroplasia , nasopharynx , oropharynx and laryngopharynx spaces. 24 children were enrolled , 13 with Achondroplasia , 2 with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia , 1 with odontochondrodysplasia , 6 with osteogenesis imperfecta and 2 with Ellis van Creveld Syndrome<disease>. Children with achondroplasia , who had adenotonsillectomy , showed fewer sleep respiratory<symptom> involvement<symptom> than untreated children. Among 13 patients with Achondroplasia , brain magnetic resonance imaging was available in 10 subjects and significant negative correlation was found between sleep respiratory patterns , nasopharynx and oropharynx space ( p < 0.05). In 2 patients with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia , mild to moderate sleep respiratory<symptom> involvement<symptom> was found. Both subjects had history of adenotonsillectomy. Mild sleep respiratory<symptom> involvement<symptom> was also shown in 4 out of 6 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. One patient with Ellis van Creveld syndrome<disease> had mild sleep respiratory disturbance. Sleep respiratory disturbances were detected in children with achondroplasia , and with less severity also in osteogenesis imperfecta and Ellis van Creveld syndrome<disease>. Adenotonsillectomy was successful in achondroplasia in reducing symptoms. In light of our findings , multicenter studies are needed to obtain further information on these rare skeletal diseases.
