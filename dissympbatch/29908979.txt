  Aneurysm<disease> wall enhancement ( AWE) on magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging has been proposed as an imaging marker of aneurysm<disease> wall inflammation<symptom> and instability. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the association between AWE and aneurysm<disease> rupture. We performed a comprehensive literature search of studies evaluating the association between AWE and aneurysm<disease> rupture. We abstracted the following study data: study design , patient demographics , aneurysm<disease> characteristics , MRI protocols , and AWE assessment. We performed meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Study heterogeneity was assessed by using the Cochrane Q and I Five studies with 492 subjects met eligibility for systematic review. We found a significant positive overall association between AWE and aneurysm<disease> rupture , with an odds ratio ( OR) of 34.26 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 10.20-115.07 , p < 0.001). No significant heterogeneity ( Q = 5.38 , p = 0.25; I AWE on magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging is significantly and independently associated with aneurysm<disease> rupture and may become a promising imaging marker to predict aneurysm<disease> behavior and identify high-risk
