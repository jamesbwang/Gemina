  The prevalence of hypotension<symptom> in emergency departments ( EDs) is approximately 1-2 % , but is associated with a mortality rate of 8-15 %. There has never been a study in Thailand examining the epidemiology or the risk factors for early mortality of patients presenting with hypotension<symptom> in the ED. Therefore , this study aimed to define the characteristics , mortality rate within 48 h and associated factors of hypotensive patients at ED. Data of patients with hypotension<symptom> attending the ED of Thammasat University Hospital ( TUH) were retrospectively studied. Of the 9,000 patients seen in the TUH ED , 233 were hypotensive for a prevalence of 2.5 %. Patients were old , with a mean age of 61 ± 20 years. The most common presenting symptom was fever<disease> , and sepsis<disease> was the most common cause of hypotension<symptom>. The mean systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) was 78 ± 8 mm Hg. Isotonic crystalloid volume resuscitation in first hour was 758 mL ( interquartile range ( IQR) , 500- 1,000) and the total volume to achieve a mean arterial pressure ( MAP) ≥ 65 mm Hg was 1,142 mL ( IQR , 500- 1,500). Twenty-seven percent of patients needed vasopressor support. Nineteen patients died ≤ 48 h , giving a case fatality rate of 8.2 %. Three independent factors associated with 48-h mortality were initial pulse rate > 100 beats/min ( odds ratio ( OR) , 4.21; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.05- 16.88; P = 0.042) , diagnosis of shock<symptom> ( OR , 13.74 ( 1.49- 126.61); P = 0.021) and recurrent hypotension<symptom> ( OR , 6.91 ( 1.54- 30.99); P = 0.012). Hypotension<symptom> in the ED was common and associated with high mortality rate. Better triage , patient monitoring and treatment may improve outcomes in these patients.
