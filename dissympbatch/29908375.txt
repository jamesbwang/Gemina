  Histological chorioamnionitis<disease> ( CAM) is related to neonatal mortality and morbidity. However , identifying intrauterine inflammation<symptom> before delivery is challenging. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in fetal heart rate ( FHR) short-term variability ( STV) during the course of histological CAM. Changes in STV were measured in 7 chronically instrumented fetal sheep at 111-120 days of gestation. Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) was infused into the amniotic cavity for 2 days following the 4th postoperative day to develop histological CAM. STV was determined based on the R to R interval of the fetal electrocardiogram. We continued to observe the changes in STV until the time of intrauterine fetal death ( IUFD). The umbilical cord and fetal membranes<symptom> were evaluated histologically after IUFD. The experiment was divided into two phases: 1) the acute phase , defined as the 24-hour period between the first and second injections of LPS and 2) the perimortem phase , defined as the period between the second injection of LPS and IUFD. Changes in STV in both the acute and perimortem phases were evaluated using Friedman 's test. A probability of < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. The fetuses died , on average , at 23.7 Â± 4.9 h after the second injection of LPS. Both the umbilical cord and fetal membranes<symptom> showed histological evidence of severe<symptom> inflammation<symptom>. During the perimortem phase , there were statistically significant differences in STV at each time point. STV increased significantly at 6 , 4 , and 3 h before intrauterine fetal death compared to the baseline. Our study suggests that STV increased as the fetal condition deteriorated during the course of histological CAM.
