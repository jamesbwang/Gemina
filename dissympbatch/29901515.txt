  We reviewed the current state of total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation ( TPIAT) for chronic pancreatitis<disease> and recurrent acute pancreatitis<disease> ( RAP). An increasing number of centers in the United States and internationally are performing TPIAT. In selected cases , TPIAT may be performed partially or entirely laparoscopically. Islet isolation is usually performed at the same center as the total pancreatectomy surgery , but new data suggest that diabetes outcomes may be nearly as good when a remote center is used for islet isolation. Ongoing clinical research is focused on patient and disease factors that predict success or failure to respond to TPIAT. Causes of persistent abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> after TPIAT may include gastrointestinal dysmotility and central sensitization to pain. Several clinical trials are underway with anti-inflammatory or other islet protective strategies to better protect islets at the time of infusion and thereby improve the diabetes results of the procedure. In summary , there is an increasing body of literature emerging from multiple centers highlighting the benefits and persistent challenges of TPIAT for chronic pancreatitis<disease> and RAP. Ongoing study will be critical to optimizing the success of this procedure.
