  There is growing interest in the role of autoimmunity in postural orthostatic tachycardia<symptom> syndrome<disease> ( POTS). In recent years , investigators have described an increased rate of co-morbid autoimmune disease , and the presence of several neural receptor autoantibodies and non-specific autoimmune markers in POTS. Case reports on the efficacy of immunotherapy in highly selected POTS patients continue to appear in the literature , while no prospective clinical trials have occurred to date. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge on the role of autoimmunity in POTS , the clinical implications of these findings , and prospects for future research.
