  Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) is a clinical syndrome<disease> characterized by ventricular contractile dysfunction. About 50 % of death in patients with HF are due to fetal ventricular arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia<symptom> and ventricular fibrillation. Understanding ventricular arrhythmic substrates and discovering effective antiarrhythmic interventions are extremely important for improving the prognosis of patients with HF and reducing its mortality. In this review , we discussed ventricular arrhythmic substrates and current clinical therapeutics for ventricular arrhythmias in HF. Base on the fact that classic antiarrhythmic drugs have the limited efficacy , side effects , and proarrhythmic potentials , we also updated some therapeutic strategies for the development of potential new antiarrhythmic interventions for patients with HF.
