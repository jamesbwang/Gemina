  Based on the theory of `` overexertion leading to Qi consumption '' , this study aimed to compare the intervention factors of nervous and physical fatigue<symptom> to establish a rat model of Qi deficiency syndrome<disease> , moreover , the systematic evaluationsystem was necessary with the standard of syndrome<disease> diagnosis of Qi deficiency. According to the clinical-mimetic principle the Qi deficiency syndrome<disease> animal model is established by the factors of sleep deprivation ( SD) and exhaustive swimming ( ES). Rats were randomly divided into four groups , normal group , SD group , ES group and compound group ( exhaustion<symptom> swimming complex sleep deprivation). The method of ES was force rats to swim until the exhaustion<symptom> with 5 % of weight , and the SD method by using multi-platform sleep deprivation of water environment randomly 14-16 h daily , and the complex set by using of two methods was combined. The movement distance , average speed , activity time and numbers into the central area were detected by open field test , swimming exhaustion<symptom> time was detected by swimming exhaustion<symptom> method , the cardiac function ( LVEF , CO , FS , LVDd) was detected by echocardiography , tongue imaging analysis and pulsedistention as the index of tongue and pulse diagnosis , the content of ATP and ADP in serum was detected by ELISA , the blood coagulation indexes for blood stasis syndrome<disease> as the additional. These results indicated that independent activity , body<symptom> weight and exercise capacity were decreased significantly , the neurological function injured significantly , heart function was decreased significantly , the tongue surface color was pale white , and the pulse distention<symptom> was decreased significantly. The content of ATP decreased significantly and the ADP increased significantly. By the method of four-diagnostic evaluation system to compare the factors of SD and ES , the Qi deficiency syndrome<disease> animalmodel could be successfully established by sleep deprivation method.
