  A 42-year-old Japanese man with a history of small intestine resection and familial Mediterranean fever<disease> was referred to our hospital for a second opinion on parkinsonism. At the age of 35 , the patient attended a hospital due to impaired left-hand movement and resting tremor<symptom>. He was previously diagnosed with multiple system atrophy based on the lack of effectiveness of levodopa treatment. With suspicion of malabsorption due to his history of ileostomy , a levodopa challenge test with levodopa intravenous infusion was conducted , and revealed a 65 % improvement in Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale part III. Therefore , diagnosis of Parkinson 's disease was made and a transdermal rotigotine patch was selected as a treatment. This treatment dose-dependently improved the patient 's symptoms. The transdermal drug delivery should be considered when patients show dose failure due to malabsorption.
