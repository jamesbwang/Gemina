  A Dacron wrap aortoplasty has been described as an adjunct to reduction ascending aortoplasty for the repair of Type A aortic dissections. We report a case of an uncomplicated hemiarch repair with wrap aortoplasty of the distal anastomosis which resulted in severe<disease> acute<symptom> hemolysis<symptom>. Despite only minimal focal graft deformation on imaging , the patient was found to have a flow gradient across the distal anastomosis , which was reduced by > 50 % following release of the outer graft wrap. To our knowledge , only 29 additional cases of hemolytic<symptom> anemia<symptom> following aortic dissection repair have been described in the English literature. The reported mechanisms included aortic graft stenosis ( 50 %) , graft kinking ( 23 %) , external compression of the graft ( 20 %) , and a folded elephant trunk appendage ( 7 %). The mean onset of hemolysis<symptom> following aortic dissection repair occurred 32.2 Â± 44.4 months after surgery , with only 16.7 % of cases occurring within 2 weeks. This review details the clinical , laboratory , and imaging findings suggestive of mechanical hemolysis<symptom> following aortic surgery.
