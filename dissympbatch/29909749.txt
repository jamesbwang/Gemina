  To compare maternal and neonatal outcomes by forceps vaginal delivery versus cesarean delivery during the second stage of labor. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a large tertiary maternity center in Shanghai , China through 2007-2016. A total of 7046 women carrying a singleton term nonanomalous fetus with vertex presentation who underwent forceps vaginal delivery , or cesarean delivery from a low station in the second stage of labor were included. Of the 7046 women , 6265 underwent forceps and 781 underwent second stage cesarean delivery. Forceps were associated with lower frequency of maternal infection ( 2.2 versus 4.7 %) , but higher incidence of mild postpartum hemorrhage<symptom> ( 4.3 versus 0.6 %). When the procedures were performed for fetal indication , forceps were associated with lower frequency of the composite of perinatal mortality and/or hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE) ( 0.5 versus 1.9 %; aOR , 0.24; 95 % CI: 0.08-0.75) , and also shorter decision to delivery interval ( 12.3 ± 3.5 min vs19 .1 ± 5.0 min). The neonatal<disease> infection<disease> rate was higher in the forceps group ( 3.9 versus 2.0 %). There were no differences in other neonatal outcomes including birth trauma. In women who had a need for intervention during the second-stage with a station of + 2 or below , forceps were associated with a lower frequency of maternal infection but a higher rate of postpartum hemorrhage<symptom>. Deliveries performed for nonreassuring status were accomplished faster by forceps and were associated with a lower frequency of the composite of perinatal mortality and HIE.
