  BACKGROUND Ethylene glycol poisoning<disease> remains an important presentation to Emergency Departments. Quick diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent renal<symptom> failure<symptom> and life-threating complications. CASE REPORT In this case report , we present a patient who was admitted unconscious to the hospital. Ethylene glycol poisoning<disease> was immediately suspected , because the patient had previously been hospitalized with similar symptoms after intake of antifreeze coolant. A urine sample was sent for microscopy and showed multiple calcium oxalate monohydrate ( COM) crystals , which supported the clinical suspicion of ethylene glycol poisoning<disease>. The patient was treated with continuous intravenous ethyl alcohol infusion and hemodialysis. Two days after admission , the patient was awake and in clinical recovery. CONCLUSIONS Demonstration of COM crystals using microscopy of a urine sample adds valuable information supporting the clinical suspicion of ethylene glycol poisoning<disease> , and may serve as an easy , quick , and cheap method that can be performed in any emergency setting.
