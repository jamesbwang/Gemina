  Bacterial<disease> vaginosis<disease> ( BV) , the leading cause of vaginal<symptom> discharge<symptom> , is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes; however , its etiology is unknown. BV treatment is not very effective , thus prevention approaches are needed. Studies investigating the impact of vitamin D on the risk of BV have had mixed findings , including two studies reporting increased risk of recurrent BV for women with higher vitamin D. Participants were nonpregnant women in a prospective fibroid study of African Americans ( ages 23-34 years) from the Detroit area. The exposure was seasonally adjusted annual mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D at enrollment. The outcome was self-reported doctor-diagnosed BV over ∼ 20 months between baseline and follow-up. Multivariable-adjusted binomial regression models estimated the risk of BV for a doubling of 25 ( OH) D and sufficient ( ≥ 20 ng/mL) versus deficient ( < 20 ng/mL) 25 ( OH) D In total , 1459 women were included. Median 25 ( OH) D was 15.2 ng/mL and 73 % were deficient. Sixteen percent of participants reported BV diagnoses over follow-up , 78 % of whom had recurrent BV. In multivariable-adjusted analyses , a doubling of 25 ( OH) D was associated with an increased , rather than the hypothesized decreased , risk of self-reported BV ( risk ratio ( RR) 1.22 , 95 % confidence interval 1.02-1.48). Sufficient women also had a significantly higher , rather than lower , risk of self-reported BV ( RR 1.31). Results were robust to sensitivity analyses , and post hoc analyses showed no evidence of reverse causation. Overall , our findings do not support vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for BV in these young , nonpregnant African American women.
