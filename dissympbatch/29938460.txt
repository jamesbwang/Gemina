  Although forcep biopsy is performed for suspicious gastric tumors during endoscopy , it is difficult to determine treatment strategies for atypical gastric glands due to uncertainty of the diagnosis. The aim of this study was to investigate clinical implications and risk factors for predicting malignancy in atypical gastric glands during forcep biopsy. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 252 patients with a diagnosis of atypical gastric gland during forcep biopsy. Predictors of malignancy were analyzed using initial endoscopic findings and clinical data. The final diagnosis for 252 consecutive patients was gastric cancer in 189 ( 75 %) , adenoma in 26 ( 10.3 %) , and gastritis<disease> in 37 ( 14.7 %). In the multivariate analysis , lesion<symptom> sizes of more than 10 mm ( odds ratio ( OR) , 3.021; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.480 to 6.165; p = 0.002) , depressed morphology ( OR , 3.181; 95 % CI , 1.579 to 6.406 , p = 0.001) , and surface nodularity ( OR , 3.432; 95 % CI , 1.667 to 7.064 , p = 0.001) were significant risk factors for malignancy. Further evaluation and treatment should be considered for atypical gastric gland during forcep biopsy if there is a large-sized ( ï¼ž 10 mm) lesion<symptom> , depressed morphology , or surface nodularity.
