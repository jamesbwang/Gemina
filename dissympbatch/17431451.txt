  We present a rare case of Kikuchi disease in a young lady presenting with fever<disease> and cervical<symptom> lymphadenopathy<disease>. Clinically , the disease mimics tuberculosis<disease> and lymphoma. Lymph node biopsy is diagnostic and treatment is symptomatic. Although tuberculosis<disease> is endemic , clinicians should be aware of uncommon conditions as early recognition of the disease will minimize unnecessary evaluation and treatment.
