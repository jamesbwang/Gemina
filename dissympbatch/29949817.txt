  Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome<disease> type II ( PGA-II) is a rare immunoendocrinopathy syndrome<disease> characterized by the occurrence of autoimmune Addison disease along with diabetes mellitus type 1 and/or autoimmune thyroid disease. Here , we report the case of a 23-year-old female with PGA-II who was followed up at the dermatology and endocrinology clinics of the Universidade Federal do Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro , located in the state of Minas Gerais , Brazil. First , the patient presented diffuse<symptom> skin hyperpigmentation , vitiligo; and in sequence , due to vomiting , appetite<symptom> and weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , hypoglycemia , amenorrhea , and galactorrhea , the patient was then diagnosed with PGA-II. The patient also presented intense hyperprolactinemia due to primary hypothyroidism. The late diagnosis of PGA-II is frequent because the disorder is uncommon and has non-specific clinical manifestations. This report emphasizes the significance of a timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases , especially Addison disease. The present study reports a rare case of a patient with PGA-II with primary amenorrhea associated with hyperprolactinemia.
