  To evaluate the efficacy of combined intralesional injection of Hyaloronidase and Triamcinolone with third molar removal in early and intermediate stage ( Stage II & III) of Oral Submucous Fibrosis<disease> ( OSMF) for improvement in mouth<symptom> opening and hypersensitivity<disease> to food. 48 patients in stage II & III OSMF were selected for the study. All the third molars were extracted in each patient followed by 6-8 doses of combined intralesional injection of Hyaloronidase and triamcinolone at 10 days interval targeting the fibrotic bands. Mouth<symptom> opening and improvement in hypersensitivity<disease> to food was noted by numerical grading. The patients were followed for one year at regular intervals. The data was expressed as mean ± SD , and a probability ( The initial mouth<symptom> opening in Stage II patients ( n = 27) was 30 ± 3.0 mm and in Stage III patients ( n = 21) was 19 ± 3.5 mm and the increase in mouth<symptom> opening at the end of treatment was 11.3 ± 1.9 mm and 10.2 ± 2.3 mm respectively. The mean improvement in hypersensitivity<disease> to food in both the groups was 2.9 and 2.2 respectively. There is significant improvement in grade II patients in mouth<symptom> opening and hypersensitivity<disease> to food. Grade III patients show variable improvement or no improvement wherein surgery becomes the only option. Third molar extraction helps in reducing inflammation<symptom> and fibrosis<disease> in the retromolar region thus easing in mouth<symptom> opening. This combined approach for moderately staged OSMF can be proposed as a viable conservative modality.
