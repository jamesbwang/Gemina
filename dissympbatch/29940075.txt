  Necrotizing enterocolitis<disease> ( NEC) is one of the most significant causes of morbidity and mortality among premature infants. The exact cause is considered multifactorial and related to gastrointestinal immaturity , inflammation<symptom> and enteral feeding. The role of nutrition is vitally important in NEC. The main modifiable risk factor is the introduction and advancement of enteral feedings. After an infant has recovered from NEC , enteral feeds should be cautiously resumed to prevent injury from prolonged use of parenteral nutrition. The logistics of how , when , and what to feed are somewhat unclear and often depend on the severity of the disease. For patients with an enterostomy , refeeding the distal intestine with the small-intestinal ostomy output may improve bowel growth and prevent long-term complications.
