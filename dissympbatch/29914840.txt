  Low body<symptom> weight in Parkinson 's disease ( PD) is poorly understood despite the associated risks of malnutrition , fractures , and death. Sarcopenia ( loss of muscle bulk and strength) and frailty are geriatric syndromes<disease> that are likewise associated with adverse health outcomes , yet have received scant attention in PD. We studied body composition , sarcopenia , frailty , and their clinico-biological correlates in PD. 93 patients and 78 spousal/sibling controls underwent comprehensive assessment of diet , clinical status , muscle strength/performance , frailty , body composition ( using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) , and serum levels of neurogastrointestinal hormones and inflammatory markers. PD patients were older than controls ( 66.0 ± 8.5 vs. 62.4 ± 8.4 years , P = 0.003). Mean body mass index ( 24.0 ± 0.4 vs. 25.6 ± 0.5 kg/m2 , P We found reduced body fat with relatively preserved skeletal muscle mass , and a high prevalence of frailty , in PD. Further studies are needed to understand the patho-mechanisms underlying these alterations.
