  We investigated the treated prevalence of bicuspid aortic valve in a pediatric population with congenital heart disease and its incident complications. A 15-year retrospective data set was analyzed. Selection criteria included age â‰¤ 17 years , enrollees in the South Carolina State Medicaid program and diagnosed as having bicuspid aortic valve on one or more service visits. The 15-year-treated prevalence of predominantly isolated bicuspid aortic valve was 2 % ( 20/1000) of pediatric congenital heart disease cases , with a non-African American: African-American ratio of 3.5:1 , and a male: female ratio of 1.6:1. Aortic stenosis ( 28.0 %) , ventricular septal defect ( 20.6 %) , and coarctation of the aorta ( 20.6 %) were the most prevalent coexisting congenital heart lesions<symptom>. Of the 378 bicuspid aortic valve cases examined , 10.3 % received aortic valve repair/replacement , which was significantly more likely to be performed in children with diagnosed aortic stenosis ( adjusted odds ratio = 12.90; 95 % confidence interval = 5.66-29.44). Cohort outcomes over the study period indicated that 9.5 % had diagnosed heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , but < 1 % had diagnosed supraventricular tachycardia<symptom> , infective endocarditis<disease> , aneurysm<disease> , dissection , or death. The majority of isolated bicuspid aortic valve cases without aortic stenosis did not require surgical intervention. Outcomes for cases requiring repair/replacement were relatively benign.
