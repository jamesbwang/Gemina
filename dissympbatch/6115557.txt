  Endomyocardial fibrosis<disease> ( EMF) is an important cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy in tropical countries. The etiopathogenesis of EMF remains obscure. The role of eosinophilia in the etiopathogenesis of EMF has been debated extensively , but remains unproven. Accordingly , we present a case wherein a patient with documented eosinophilia and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> at the age of three-and-a-half years presented with endomyocardial fibrosis<disease> at the age of nine years. Such documentation is important to highlight the central role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of EMF.
