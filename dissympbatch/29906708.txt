  Evaluation of biochemical derangements related to metabolic syndrome<disease> in epileptic patients on treatment with Valproic acid. This study consisted of two groups of 42 patients. Group I- Newly diagnosed patients with epileptic<symptom> seizures<symptom> untreated with any Anti-epileptic drugs ( AEDs). Group II- Patients on treatment with Valproic acid for more than one year. Age and gender matched patients of 18-40 years were recruited. Patients who were diabetic , hypertensive , smokers , alcoholics , with persistent infection , head injuries , pregnancy and lactation were excluded from the study. Biochemical parameters , fasting blood glucose , lipid profile , Malondialdehyde ( MDA) , Total Antioxidant Status ( TAS) , MDA/TAS ratio , leptin , adiponectin , fasting insulin , high sensitive c-reactive protein ( hsCRP) , Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR) and leptin/adiponectin ratio were estimated. There was a decrease in Total cholesterol and Low Density Lipoprotein- cholesterol levels among the VPA-treated epileptic patients in comparison to newly diagnosed patients. BMI did not differ between the untreated and treated patients. There were no significant difference in the levels of hsCRP , leptin and TAS between the newly diagnosed and VPA-treated patients. Increased insulin as well as HOMA-IR levels and decreased adiponectin levels were found in VPA treated subjects when compared to the newly diagnosed patients. Oxidative stress parameters ( MDA , MDA/TAS ratio) were elevated in VPA treated subjects when compared to newly diagnosed patients. VPA treatment increased the risk factors for the development of metabolic syndrome<disease> such as hyperinsulinemia , insulin resistance and oxidative stress. However VPA treatment corrected the dyslipidemia of epileptic patients.
