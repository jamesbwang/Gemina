  Diabetes and hypothyroidism produce adverse effects on body<symptom> weight and sexual maturity by inhibiting body growth and metabolism. The occurrence of diabetes is always accompanied with thyroid dysfunction. Thus , it is important to take hypo- or hyper-thyroidism into consideration when exploring the adverse effects caused by diabetes. Previous reports have found hypothyroidism inhibits testicular growth by delaying Sertoli cell differentiation and proliferation. Hence , by establishing a mouse model of diabetes combined with hypothyroidism , we provided evidence that poly glandular autoimmune syndrome<disease> affected testicular development and spermatogenesis. we mimicked polyglandular deficiency syndrome<disease> in both immature and prepubertal mice by induction of diabetes and hypothyroidism , which caused decreases in serum concentrations of testosterone and insulin like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1). Such reduction of growth factor resulted in inhibition of testicular and epididymal development. Moreover , expressions of Claudin-11 were observed between Sertoli cells and disrupted in the testes of syndrome<disease> group mice. We also found reduced sperm count and motility in prepubertal mice. This mimicry of the diabetes and thyroid dysfunction , will be helpful to better understand the reasons for male infertility<symptom> in diabetic-cum-hypothyroid patients.
