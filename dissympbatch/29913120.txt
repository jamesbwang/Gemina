  Irinotecan is highly effective in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer as well as many other cancers. However , irinotecan is known to cause severe<symptom> diarrhea<disease> , which pose significant problems in patients undergoing irinotecan based chemotherapy. Dietary and herbal components have shown promise in improving gastrointestinal health. Therefore , we compared the effect of grain-based chow diet containing phytoestrogens and corn/alfalfa as fat source to purified diets containing either animal-derived fat source ( lard) or plant-derived fat source ( soybean oil) on irinotecan-induced toxicities in mice. The concentration of the toxic metabolite , SN-38 , was measured in the serum , and the activity of main enzyme , carboxylesterase ( CEs) involved in biotransformation of irinotecan to SN-38 formation was measured in the liver. We found that the grain-based diet was protective against irinotecan-induced diarrhea<disease> Interestingly , purified diet containing lard caused fatty liver in mice , while grain-based chow diet containing corn/alfa-alfa or purified diet with soybean oil did not cause fat deposition in the liver. Serum SN-38 concentration was significantly higher in the mice fed with purified diets compared to the chow-fed mice. Hepatic CEs activity was induced in the presence of irinotecan in mice on purified diets , but not chow diet. These results indicate that components of grain-based natural diet ( presumably phytoestrogens and/or the macronutrients balance<symptom>) compared to purified diets may have a beneficial effect by controlling the adverse effects of irinotecan in cancer patients.
