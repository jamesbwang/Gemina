  Behçet disease ( BD) is a systemic vasculitis involving vessels from any size with various clinical features. Most BD cases are multifactorial and associated with the HLA B51 antigen. In rare and severe early onset cases , dominant Mendelian transmission has been linked to mutations in the TNFAIP3 gene encoding A20. Herein , we propose a systematic review of the literature about the haploinsufficiency A20 ( HA20) published cases. Our review of the 45 cases of HA20 from literature highlights the similarities and the differences between this genetic auto-inflammatory disease and classical BD. HA20 looks like BD if we consider recurrent oral ( 87 %) and genital ( 67 %) ulcers<disease> , arthralgia or arthritis<disease> ( 42 %) , skin involvement ( 53 %) such as erythema nodosum or abdominal<symptom> symptoms<symptom> ( 60 %) such as abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , digestive ulcers<disease> or diarrhea<disease> However , HA20 differs from classical BD because its geographical distribution is ubiquitous , sex ratio is inversed ( one man for two women) , first symptoms occur in early childhood ( median age = 5.5 years; interquartile range: 1-10) instead of adulthood , recurrent fever<disease> is common ( 62 %) unlike classical BD , HLA B51 antigen is uncommon and abdominal<symptom> symptoms<symptom> are over-represented compared to classical BD. In addition , response to colchicine in HA20 is inconstant ( 24 %) unlike classical BD. High fever<disease> flares and digestive involvement starting in early childhood seem to be hallmarks of HA20 clinical features. Response to colchicine is unpredictable and biotherapies like anti-TNFα and anti IL1 appear to be treatments of choice , like for other auto-inflammatory diseases. Prospective description of larger cohort of HA20 cases is needed to understand better when this disease must be looked for and how to treat these patients.
