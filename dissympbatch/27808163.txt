  To compare the performance of the Ogawa-Kudoh method with the modified Petroff technique in diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis<disease> A total of 205 sputum<symptom> samples from 166 patients with clinical suspicion or under pulmonary tuberculosis<disease> follow-up , seen at a public tertiary care hospital , from July 2014 to July 2016 were used. All samples were simultaneously processed using the Ogawa-Kudoh and modified Petroff decontamination methods , according to the recommendations of the Ministry of Health. In the statistical analysis , the McNemar test and the Kappa index were used , respectively , to compare proportions and verify agreement between data. The Ogawa-Kudoh and modified Petroff methods were efficient in mycobacteria detection , with no significant differences in results ( p = 0.549) and contamination rate of the cultures ( p = 0.065). The agreement between techniques was considered excellent ( Kappa index of 0.877) and Ogawa-Kudoh , as compared to the modified Petroff technique , showed sensitivity of 90.4 % , specificity of 96.6 % , positive predictive value of 94.3 % and negative predictive value of 94.2 %. The Ogawa-Kudoh technique proved to be sufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis<disease> , and , therefore , suitable for routine laboratory application. Since it is simple , low-cost and has less technical requirements for biosafety and professional training , Ogawa-Kudoh is an alternative for managers and healthcare professionals to promote the expansion of bacteriological diagnostic coverage of pulmonary
