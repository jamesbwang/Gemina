  Sudden sensorineural hearing loss ( SSHL) accompanied by vertigo<symptom> may portend a negative prognosis in the hearing outcome. To investigate the association of vertigo<symptom> with prognosis of hearing variables in SSHL. A literature search of eligible studies was performed in PubMed , Web of Science , and Embase from September 26 , 1973 , through September 26 , 2017. Studies published in English were retrieved with no restrictions on the date of publication. References were identified by screening the proceedings of relevant reviews , and annual meeting and other correlative papers were scanned manually for enrollment. All original research studies and retrospective or prospective studies focusing on the role of vertigo<symptom> in the prognosis for the hearing outcome of SSHL were systematically retrieved. Studies that did not include data regarding the association between the rate of hearing recovery and vertigo<symptom> were excluded , as were reviews , comments , case reports , editorials , letters , and practice guidelines. Data were extracted and evaluated by 2 researchers. Data extracted included research type , number of participants with or without vertigo<symptom> , treatment regime , definition of pure-tone average , criteria for hearing improvement , and length of follow-up. The quality of included studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale ( scores range from 0-9 , with a score of â‰¥ 6 indicating a high-quality study). The data were synthesized in Mantel-Haenszel models; the aggregate results were estimated in forest<disease> plots. Association of vertigo<symptom> with the prognosis for the hearing outcome of SSHL. Of the 4814 unique patients identified in 10 studies , 1709 were included in the SSHL group with vertigo<symptom> and 3105 were included in SSHL group without vertigo<symptom>. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale score of each study selected was greater than 7. The recovery rate of hearing was 42.13 % in the group with vertigo<symptom> , compared with 60.29 % in the group without vertigo<symptom>. Vertigo<symptom> was significantly associated with a worse hearing recovery ( odds ratio , 2.22; 95 % CI , 1.54-3.20; I2 = 74 %). Similar results were obtained in subgroup analyses of the grading system using the Siegel criteria and systemic corticosteroid therapy. However , no association of vertigo<symptom> with the prognosis of SSHL was observed within the subgroup receiving intratympanic corticosteroids ( odds ratio , 1.78; 95 % CI , 0.64-4.94; I2 = 70 %). Current evidence revealed that vertigo<symptom> may be negatively associated with hearing recovery in patients with SSHL , except in a subgroup that received intratympanic corticosteroids. Corticosteroid injection may be more effective for treatment of SSHL accompanied by vertigo<symptom>; future studies are needed to determine whether treatment of vertigo<symptom> might contribute to the recovery of SSHL.
