  Poor<symptom> wound<disease> healing in critical limb ischemia ( CLI) is attributed to impaired neovascularization and reperfusion. Optimizing the ischemic wound<disease> with adhesion molecules that enhance stem cell homing may revolutionize treatment. The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of adhesion molecule E-selectin on wound<disease> healing in an ischemic mouse wound<disease>. Adult FVB/NJ mice underwent unilateral femoral artery and vein ligation to induce CLI. A 4-mm punch biopsy wound<disease> was created on the anterior thigh to simulate ischemic wounds<disease> Intramuscular injection of adeno-associated virus ( AAV) carrying either E-selectin ( E-selectin/AAV , n = 11) or LacZ as control ( LacZ/AAV , n = 10) was performed. Gross wound size was measured for 10 d postoperatively. Ischemic hindlimb reperfusion was quantified using laser Doppler imaging. Wound tissue neovascularization was visualized using DiI perfusion and confocal microscopy. E-selectin expression in wounds<disease> was verified by immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence confirmed E-selectin/AAV delivery in treatment versus control limbs. Wounds<disease> from E-selectin/AAV mice versus controls revealed surface area healing of 54 % versus 20 % ( P < 0.01) on postoperative day ( POD) 1 , 78 % versus 51 % on POD 4 ( P < 0.01) , and 97 % versus 84 % on POD 10 ( P < 0.01). Laser Doppler imaging revealed greater reperfusion in E-selectin/AAV mice versus controls by POD 10 ( 0.49 versus 0.27 , P < 0.05). DiI perfused ligated hindlimb in E-selectin/AAV versus control mice revealed mean neovascularization intensity score of 30 versus 18 ( P < 0.05) on POD 10. Intramuscularly injected E-selectin/AAV gene therapy in mice with CLI significantly increases wound<disease> angiogenesis and limb reperfusion , expediting overall wound<disease> healing.
