  CHEK2 plays a key role in cellular response to DNA damage , and also in regulation of mitosis and maintenance of chromosomal stability. In patients newly diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome<disease> ( MDS , n = 107) or acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML , n = 117) congenital CHEK2 mutations ( c. 444 + 1G > A , c. 1100delC , del5395 , p.I157 T) were tested by PCR and sequencing analysis. The karyotype of bone<disease> marrow cells of each patient was assessed at disease diagnosis using classical cytogenetic methods and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The CHEK2 mutations were strongly associated with the risk of MDS ( p < 0.0001) but not with the risk of de novo AML ( p = 0.798). In CHEK2-positive MDS patients , two times higher frequency of aberrant karyotypes than in CHEK2-negative patients was found ( 71 % vs. 37 % , p = 0.015). In CHEK2-positive patients with cytogenetic abnormalities , subtypes of MDS: refractory anemia<symptom> with excess blasts-1 or 2 , associated with unfavorable disease prognosis , were diagnosed two times more often than in CHEK2-negative cases with aberrations ( 78 % vs. 44 %). In conclusion , the congenital CHEK2 inactivation is strongly associated with the risk of MDS and with a poorer prognosis of the disease. However , the chromosomal instability in AML is not correlated with the hereditary dysfunction of CHEK2.
