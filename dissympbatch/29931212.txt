  High dose ascorbic acid ( HDAA) has been touted to ameliorate inflammation<symptom> and reduce fluid requirements during burn shock<symptom> resuscitation ( BSR). Whether this leads to improved outcomes is not known. The authors ' aim for this study was to compare ventilator days , ventilator-associated<disease> pneumonia<disease> , and mortality between patients who did and did not receive HDAA during BSR.The authors performed a retrospective case control study from 2012 to 2015. They identified 38 patients ( HDAA) who received HDAA during BSR. Using age and % TBSA , the authors identified and matched 42 control patients ( CTL) who did not receive HDAA for BSR during that same time period. The authors collected data for age , % TBSA , hospital days ( LOS) , ventilator days ( VENT) , inhalation injury ( INH) , ventilator-associated<disease> pneumonia<disease> ( VAP) , and mortality ( MORT). There were no differences in age and % TBSA or % TBSA of third-degree burn injury between groups. There was no significant difference in the incidence of INH ( HDAA-52 % vs CTL-36 % , P = .17) and the groups had similar LOS and VENT. Additionally , there was no significant difference in VAP incidence ( HDAA-29 % vs CTL-14 % , P = .13) or mortality ( HDAA-26 % vs CTL-23 % , P = .8). HDAA patients had a numerically higher incidence of acute<symptom> renal<symptom> failure<symptom> requiring dialysis ( 23 vs 7 % , P = .06) which was confirmed in a multivariate analysis ( odds ratio 5.4; 95 % confidence interval 1.1-26). HDAA , while potentially reducing inflammation<symptom> and fluid requirements during BSR , may not improve any meaningful outcomes such as ventilator requirements , ventilator-associated<disease> pneumonia<disease> , and mortality.
