  Lymphoproliferative disorder ( LPD) is a potentially severe adverse effect of methotrexate ( MTX) administration in patients with rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA). We report a case of MTX-associated LPD ( MTX-LPD) in a patient with RA who developed severe<symptom> pulmonary<symptom> failure<symptom> complicated by perforation of the terminal ileum. A 61-year-old woman with RA receiving MTX complained of dyspnea<symptom> and abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> She was diagnosed with intestinal perforation and peritonitis<disease> , and underwent immediate abdominal surgery. Pathological examinations of the specimen obtained from the resected ileum and a bone<disease> marrow aspirate revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Steroid therapy failed to improve her respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> , but her condition improved after abdominal surgery and suspension of MTX. MTX-LPD can result in multiple life-threatening conditions; however , the symptoms are highly variable. RA patients receiving MTX should thus be monitored carefully , and MTX administration should be stopped immediately on suspicion of MTX-LPD.
