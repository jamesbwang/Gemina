  To date , there is no consensus regarding first‑line chemotherapy for patients with HER2‑negative , locally advanced/metastatic gastric cancer ( a/m GC). In the present study we reported a retrospective case‑series of patients treated with a weekly regimen containing timed‑flat infusion of 5‑fluorouracil ( TFI/5 FU) , docetaxel and oxaliplatin. From June 2007 to July 2017 , 32 consecutive a/m GC patients were treated with first‑line standard ( st) or modulated ( mod) ` FD/FOx ' regimen: Weekly 12 h ( from 10.00 p.m. to 10.00 a.m.) TFI/5 FU for two consecutive nights<symptom> at 900 mg/m2/day , associated to weekly alternating docetaxel , 50 mg/m2 and oxaliplatin , 80 mg/m2. The median age of the patients was 60 years and their Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group‑performance status ( ECOG‑PS) was as follows: i) ECOG‑PS 0/1 , ( n = 28 , 87.5 %); and ii) ECOG‑PS 2 ( n = 4 , 12.5 %). Patient activity , efficacy and safety data were collected and subgroup analyses were conducted among patients treated with st and mod FD/FOx. In the intention‑to‑treat ( ITT) analysis , the objective response rate ( ORR) was 75 % ( 95 % CI , 53‑90) and the disease control rate ( DCR) was 87.5 % ( 95 % CI , 67.6‑97.3). After a median follow‑up of 16 months , median progression‑free survival ( PFS) and median overall survival ( OS) were 14.0 and 19.0 months , respectively. The received dose‑intensities were ~ 80 % of the standard doses for each agent. The most relevant treatment‑related grade 3 adverse events were: Neutropenia ( 40.6 %) , asthenia<symptom> ( 18.7 %) and diarrhea<disease> ( 18.7 %). The only treatment‑related grade 4 adverse event was neutropenia ( 9.3 %). No febrile neutropenia was observed and none of the patients died as a result of adverse events. FD/FOx regimen appeared to be a feasible option as a first‑line treatment of a/m GC patients , especially in case of high‑tumor burden , with the need of rapid tumor shrinkage and disease‑related symptoms palliation.
