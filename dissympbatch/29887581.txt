  Cardiovascular disease ( CVD) has a tremendous impact on the quality of life of humans. While experimental animals are valuable to medical research as models of human<disease> diseases<disease> , cardiac systems differ widely across various animal species. Thus , we examined a CVD model in cynomolgus monkeys. Laboratory primates are precious resources , making it imperative that symptoms of diseases and disorders are detected as early as possible. Thus , in this study we comprehensively examined important indicators of CVD in cynomolgus monkeys , including arterial blood gas , complete blood count ( CBC) , biochemistry and cardiac hormones. The control group included 20 healthy macaques showing non-abnormal findings in screening tests , whereas the CVD group included 20 macaques with valvular disease and cardiomyopathy. An increase of red blood cell distribution width was observed in the CBC , indicating chronic inflammation<symptom> related to CVD. An increase of HCO
