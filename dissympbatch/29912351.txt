  Requests by patients for antibiotics are known to strongly affect doctors ' decisions to prescribe them. Objective. The aim of this study was to establish how frequently patients presenting with respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> ( RTIs) express their expectation not to be treated with antibiotics , which symptoms and physical findings are related to their perception of antibiotics not being helpful , and to what degree their expectations influence doctors ' decisions. This was a direct observational study set in primary care practices in Bialystok , Poland. The observers completed a checklist while observing a patient with RTI visiting a family doctor. Overall , 80 ( 5.5 %) out of 1456 patients with RTIs openly requested not to be prescribed antibiotics. Patients not wanting antibiotics were prescribed antibiotics significantly less frequently ( 25/80 ( 31.3 %)) than the remaining patients ( 765/1376 ( 55.6 %) , P < 0.001). Univariate logistic regression revealed that cough<symptom> and runny<symptom> nose<symptom> significantly increased the odds of patients not wanting antibiotics ( odds ratio ( OR) 1.8 , 95 % confidence intervals ( CI): 1.01-3.20 and OR 1.6 , 95 % CI: 1.01-2.6 , respectively) while the presence of tonsillar exudates<symptom> significantly decreased the odds ( OR 0.3 , 95 % CI: 0.08-0.86). Belief in a self-limited course ( 20 %) , recent treatments with antibiotics ( 16.3 %) , suspected viral aetiology ( 12.5 %) , and concerns about possible harm ( 12.5 %) were the principal reasons for not wanting antibiotics. A patient 's wish not to be prescribed antibiotics leads to less frequent antibiotic prescribing. Antimicrobial resistance , though important from a public health viewpoint , is not seen as a priority for individual patients with infections.
