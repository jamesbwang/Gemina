  Minimally invasive dentistry ( MID) encompasses early caries<disease> diagnosis through caries<disease> risk assessment ( CRA) , early detection of incipient carious lesion<symptom> including primary and secondary prevention based on scientific evidence that remineralization of demineralized enamel and dentin is possible if detected early. Although the dental curriculum focuses on the advantages of MID in tooth preservation , this science is not usually translated into practice. This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge , attitude , and skills of dental practitioners of Puducherry regarding the concepts of MID. Data were collected through an online survey questionnaire based on awareness and practice of MID. Statistical evaluation was done on SPSS by Chi-square test. A total of 126 dentists responded of which only 55 % were trained in MID during their undergraduate and internship period , mainly through lectures ( 49.6 %). Nearly 81 % agreed that CRA should be conducted for all patients. Almost 42.7 % had heard about International Caries Detection and Assessment System , but only 25.9 % used a blunt explorer for caries<disease> detection. About 13.7 % use magnification ( loupes/microscope) , but majority ( 84.7 %) use radiographs. More than 70 % were unaware of newer methods of caries<disease> detection. Statistically significant differences were found ( Although there is knowledge about advantages of MID among dentists of Puducherry , it does not benefit patients , as many practitioners still follow the traditional principles of total caries<disease> removal.
