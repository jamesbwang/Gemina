  Irritable bowel syndrome<disease> ( IBS) is a functional disorder of the gastrointestinal tract , the physiology of which is not very well understood. There are multiple factors and pathways involved in pathogenesis of this entity. Among all , dysmotility , dysregulation of the brain-gut axis , altered intestinal microbiota and visceral hypersensitivity<disease> play a major role. Over the last years , research has shown that the type of gut microbiome present in an individual plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of IBS. Multiple studies have consistently shown that subjects diagnosed with IBS have disruption in gut microbiota balance<symptom>. It has been established that host immune system and its interaction with metabolic products of gut microbiota play an important role in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore , probiotics , prebiotics and antibiotics have shown some promising results in managing IBS symptoms via modulating the interaction between the above. This paper discusses the various factors involved in pathophysiology of IBS , especially gut microbiota.
