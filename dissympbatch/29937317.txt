  Resistin is an immunometabolic mediator that is elevated in several inflammatory disorders. A ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 , resistin modulates the recruitment and activation of myeloid cells , notably neutrophils. Neutrophils are major drivers of cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) lung disease , in part due to the release of human neutrophil elastase- and myeloperoxidase-rich primary granules , leading to tissue damage. Here we assessed the relationship of resistin to CF lung disease. Resistin levels were measured in plasma and sputum<symptom> from three retrospective CF cohorts spanning a wide range of disease. We also assessed the ability of neutrophils to secrete resistin upon activation in vitro. Finally , we constructed a multivariate model assessing the relationship between resistin levels and lung function. Plasma resistin levels were only marginally higher in CF than in healthy control subjects. By contrast , sputum<symptom> resistin levels were very high in CF , reaching 50-100 fold higher levels than in plasma. Among CF patients , higher plasma resistin levels were associated with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis , and higher sputum<symptom> resistin levels were associated with CF-related diabetes. Mechanistically , in vitro release of neutrophil primary granules was concomitant with resistin secretion. Overall , sputum<symptom> resistin levels were negatively correlated with CF lung function , independently of other variables ( age , sex , and genotype). Our data establish relationships between resistin levels in the plasma and sputum<symptom> of CF patients that correlate with disease status , and identify resistin as a novel mechanistic link between neutrophilic inflammation<symptom> and lung disease in CF.
