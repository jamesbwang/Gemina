  The oncostatin M ( OSM) pathway drives fibrosis<disease> , inflammation<symptom> and vasculopathy , and is a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. The aim of this first-time-in-human experimental medicine study was to assess the safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics and target engagement of single subcutaneous doses of GSK2330811 , an anti-OSM monoclonal antibody , in healthy subjects. This was a phase I , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , single-dose escalation , first-time-in-human study of subcutaneously administered GSK2330811 in healthy adults ( NCT02386436). Safety and tolerability , GSK2330811 pharmacokinetic profile , OSM levels in blood and skin , and the potential for antidrug antibody formation were assessed. The in vivo affinity of GSK2330811 for OSM and target engagement in serum and skin blister fluid ( obtained via a skin suction blister model) were estimated using target-mediated drug disposition ( TMDD) models in combination with compartmental and physiology-based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK) models. Thirty subjects were randomized to receive GSK2330811 and 10 to placebo in this completed study. GSK2330811 demonstrated a favourable safety profile in healthy subjects; no adverse events were serious or led to withdrawal. There were no clinically relevant trends in change from baseline in laboratory values , with the exception of a reversible dose-dependent reduction in platelet count. GSK2330811 exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 0.1-6 mg kg Single subcutaneous doses of GSK2330811 were well tolerated in healthy subjects. GSK2330811 demonstrated sufficient affinity to achieve target engagement in systemic circulation and target skin tissue , supporting the progression of GSK2330811 clinical development.
