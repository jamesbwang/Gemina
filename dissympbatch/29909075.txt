  Neonatal injury-induced exaggeration of pain hypersensitivity<disease> after adult trauma is a significant clinical challenge. However , the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Growing evidence shows that spinal Src homology-2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 ( SHP2) contributes to chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> in adult rodents. Here we demonstrated that the phosphorylation and expression of SHP2 in synaptosomal fraction of the spinal dorsal horn are elevated in adult rats subjected to neonatal and adult incisions ( nIN-IN) , and the upregulation of SHP2 is highly correlated with pain hypersensitivity<disease>. Intrathecal blockade of SHP2 phosphorylation using a SHP2 protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor NSC-87877 , or knockdown of SHP2 by intrathecal delivery of small interfering RNA ( siRNA) , ameliorates mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia in nIN-IN rats. Moreover , the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K) in the spinal dorsal horn is significantly increased in nIN-IN rats. Intrathecal application of PI3K inhibitor , LY294002 or wortmannin , alleviates pain hypersensitivity<disease> in nIN-IN rats. Additionally , intrathecal administration of NSC-87877 or SHP2 siRNA attenuates the upregulation of PI3K. Finally , no alternation of SHP2 phosphorylation in the dorsal root ganglion and dorsal root of nIN-IN rats as well as PI3K expression in the dorsal root of nIN-IN rats intrathecally treated with NSC-87877 or SHP2 siRNA is observed. These results suggest that the phosphorylation and expression of SHP2 in the spinal dorsal horn play vital roles in neonatal incision-induced exaggeration of adult incisional pain via PI3K. Thus , SHP2 and PI3K may serve as potential therapeutic targets for exaggerated incisional pain induced by neonatal and adult injuries.
