  Opercular myoclonic-anarthric status epilepticus ( OMASE) is a rare form of epilepsia partialis continua presenting as fluctuating dysarthria<symptom> , or even anarthria. The condition is caused by an epileptogenic lesion<symptom> involving the opercular cortex of either hemisphere. Speech impairment is secondary to bilateral epileptic activity affecting the glossopharyngeal muscles. This bilateral nature of the condition is due to the fact that innervation of cranial nerves V , VII , IX , X and XII from the opercular area of the primary motor cortex is bilateral. The aetiology of the condition varies , and includes vascular lesions<symptom> , tumours , and encephalitis<disease> , among other causes. A low threshold for clinical suspicion is necessary in order to ensure the timely initiation of antiepileptic treatment , thereby preventing the condition from becoming drug resistant. We present two cases of OMASE which differ in terms of aetiology , clinical course , and treatment response. ( Published with video sequences on www.epilepticdisorders.com).
