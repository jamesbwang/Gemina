  A HoBi-like pestivirus was first described in 2004 in a Brazilian fetal bovine serum that was exported to Germany. Nevertheless , it is believed that the virus had been present since the 1990 's , when it was detected in buffalos of Brazilian origin. Reproductive and respiratory<disease> diseases<disease> have been reported since 2001 in cattle , and more recently , diseases accompanied by a clinical presentation of mucosal disease-like ( MD-like lesions<symptom> have been reported as well. In the present study , the authors reported the oldest case of MD-- like in cattle , associated with a HoBi-like pestivirus infection. Diarrhea<disease> , anorexia<symptom> , nasal<symptom> discharge<symptom> , hypersalivation , and weakness<symptom> were observed in 20 calves. For two of the animals , clinical follow-ups were performed. Following their death , necropsy<disease> was performed on these two calves. The main gross alterations observed were ulcers<disease> and erosions in the upper and lower digestive tract and interdigital dermatitis<disease>. Clinical history , gross findings , histopathological examination , immunohistochemistry , RT-PCR , and virus isolation were determined as suitable tools for the diagnosis of a MD-like outbreak , caused by a HoBi-like pestivirus.
