  The present study was designed to explore the difference between two rat models of sepsis<disease> and to establish a more stable rat model. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham operation group , simple cecal ligation and perforation group ( SCLP) , and cecal ligation perforation plus drainage group ( CLP-DS). The general condition of the rats was observed , and the time of death and survival rate at 72 h were recorded. The arterial blood and lung tissue were obtained 9 h after the operation. The mortality of the CLP-DS group was significantly higher than that of the SCLP group. The limitation package , intestinal adhesion , and poor drainage were detected in the SCLP rats , whereas intestinal<symptom> edema<symptom> and hyperemia<symptom> , bloody water in the abdominal cavity , but no inflammatory package were observed 24 h after the operation in the CLP-DS rats by autopsy. There were significant differences in interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha levels between the SCLP group and the CLP-DS group. Severe pulmonary septal thickening , alveolar wall vascular congestion<symptom> , and protein debris deposition in the alveolar cavity were observed in the SCLP group , whereas pulmonary bullae were observed in the CLP-DS group using light microscopy , and there were significant difference among groups in Smith lung injury score. These results suggested that the cecal ligation combined with puncture drainage model of sepsis<disease> is more stable than that of the simple cecal ligation and puncture model of sepsis<disease> in the rat , which resolved the problem of puncture wrapped in the traditional CLP model of sepsis<disease> in rat.
