  Glosssopharyngeal neuralgia ( GPN) is a painful syndrome<disease> characterized by paroxysmal neuropathic pain in the pharynx , tonsil , posterior base of tongue , inner ear , and mandibular angle. The traditional therapies of GPN , including medication and surgical operation , are not always effective in pain controlling. Radiofrequency therapy is a minimally interventional technique to provide analgesia in chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Two patients who were refractory to medical treatment were hospitalized for primary GPN. Two patients were diagnosed by symptoms , physical signs and imaging examination. The first patient underwent pulsed radiofrequency of the glossopharyngeal nerve under CT-guidance as a preferred method. The pulsed radiofrequency ( PRF) was performed at 42 Â°C for 10 minutes with a pulsed frequency of 2 Hz and a pulse width 20 ms. There is no symptom improvement after PRF procedure. Three days later , continuous radiofrequency ( CRF) thermocoagulation was performed. The pain disappeared after CRF within 36 months followed-up. CRF thermocoagulation under CT-guidance was accepted by the second patient as the first choice. An overall reduction of pain was reported after the procedure and telephone consult for 24-months follow-up confirmed the persistence of the pain relief. The CRF thermocoagulation produced no complications or side effects in the two cases , and was proved effective in the treatment of GPN.
