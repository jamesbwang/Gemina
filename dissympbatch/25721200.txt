  Sugarcane ( Saccharum L. plant) is an important crop for sugar and bio-energy production around the world. Among sugarcane diseases , smut caused by Sporisorium scitamineum is one of the major fungal<disease> diseases<disease> causing severe<symptom> losses<symptom> to the sugarcane industry. The use of PCR reference genes is essential to the normalization of data on gene expression involving the sugarcane-S. scitamineum interaction system; however , no report that addresses criteria in selecting these reference genes has been published to date. In this study , 10 sugarcane genes and eight S. scitamineum genes were selected as candidate PCR reference genes in the sugarcane-S. scitamineum interaction system. The stability and reliability of these 18 candidate genes were analyzed in smut-resistant ( NCo376) and- susceptible ( YC71-374) genotypes using the statistical algorithms geNorm , NormFinder , BestKeeper , and deltaCt method. Subsequently , the relative expression levels of the sugarcane chitinase I-3 gene and S. scitamineum chorismate mutase gene were determined to validate the applicability of these sugarcane and S. scitamineum PCR reference genes , respectively. We finally found that the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene ( ACAD) , serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 1 gene ( SARMp1) , or their combination ( ACAD + SARMp1) could be utilized as the most suitable reference genes for normalization of sugarcane gene expression in sugarcane bud tissues after S. scitamineum infection. Similarly , the inosine 5 '- monophosphate dehydrogenase gene ( S10) , the SEC65-signal recognition particle subunit gene ( S11) , or their combination ( S10 + S11) were suitable for normalization of S. scitamineum gene expression in sugarcane bud tissues. The PCR reference genes ACAD , SARMp1 , S10 , and S11 may be employed in gene transcriptional studies involving the sugarcane-S. scitamineum interaction system.
