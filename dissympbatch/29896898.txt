  The role of sweat<symptom> gland in inflammation<symptom> has not received sufficient attention. The thermal stress during the summer months in tropical areas provides an opportunity to study the morphological patterns of inflammation<symptom> produced primarily by the sweat<symptom> gland. To collect clinical data on sweat-induced dermatitis<disease> during the summer months. A hospital-based descriptive cross-sectional study was done during the hot and humid summer months of April to June in a tertiary care institute in Puducherry. Patients clinically diagnosed with sweat-induced dermatitis<disease> ( dermatitis<disease> primarily due to retention or extravasation of sweat<symptom>) were included in the study. A detailed history was taken , and clinical examination was done. One hundred and fifty patients were included in the study. Various typical and atypical manifestations of sweat-induced dermatitis<disease> were seen. `` Sweat<symptom> dermatitis<disease> '' presenting with dry , hyperpigmented , fissured `` parchment ''- like skin , shiny `` crinkled cellophane paper ''- like skin , or asymptomatic hyperpigmented macules was seen. Other atypical presentations included miliaria pustulosa with `` hypopyon<symptom> sign '' and `` linear and parallel ridge pattern '' of dermatitis<disease> in patients with miliaria rubra affecting the lower neck and upper chest. A wide spectrum of sweat-induced dermatitis<disease> was seen during the summer months in a tropical region. It reflects the role of the sweat<symptom> gland in cutaneous inflammation<symptom>. An increased awareness of atypical manifestations is needed.
