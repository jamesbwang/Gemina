  Necrotizing fasciitis<disease> is a severe infection of the subcutaneous tissue characterized by necrosis<symptom> of the superficial fascia and overlying skin and is usually associated with previous trauma and comorbidities. Periorbital necrotizing fasciitis<disease> is rare and commonly causes visual loss and soft tissue defects. A better prognosis relies critically on early diagnosis , prompt medical treatment , and timely surgical intervention. We describe a rare case of periorbital necrotizing fasciitis<disease> in the absence of an inciting event. A 55-year-old female patient presented with acute<symptom> painful<symptom> swelling and redness of the right upper eyelid that spread to both eyelids bilaterally within 24 h. We swiftly started the patient on intravenous antibiotic therapy , and we surgically debrided the necrotic tissue the following day. We performed two further procedures to improve eyelid closure and appearance. Despite the severe presentation , timely antibiotic therapy and proper surgical interventions led to a successful outcome in this case.
