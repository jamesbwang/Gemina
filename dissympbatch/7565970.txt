  Obesity and related metabolic disorders are growing health challenges worldwide and individuals at military service are not exceptions. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MS) in the Korean military and to compare with the general population. This was a cross-sectional study of 4,803 young military participants who underwent a corporal health-screening program between October 2013 and October 2014. The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria was used to identify MS. We also sampled 1,108 men aged 19-29 years from the Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey from 2010 to 2013 to compare with their military counterparts. The mean age of military participants was 20.8 Â± 1.1 years , and 20.6 % ( n = 988) were obese. The prevalence of MS was 0.8 % in military participants , while 7.9 % in general population. The risk factors of MS were less prominent among military participants relative to civilians , with the exception of high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , of which prevalence was higher among military participants ( 21.5 % vs. 18.2 % , respectively). In multiple logistic analysis , high physical activity conferred lower odds of MS and obesity in military participants ( odds ratios , 0.19 and 0.81 , respectively). Age older than 25 years increased risk of most components of MS among civilians. The prevalence of obesity and MS is lower in military participants compared with civilians of similar age. Monitoring of high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and proper stress management are warranted in those at military service.
