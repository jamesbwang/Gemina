  To describe the tolerability and rate of nifurtimox discontinuation when administered as a second-line treatment to patients with previous treatment interruptions due to adverse reactions with benznidazole. Prospective cohort study of adult patients with chronic Chagas disease in a referral centre in Spain; study period July 2007 to July 2017. We analysed the tolerability profile and treatment interruption rate due to adverse reactions to nifurtimox in patients previously incompletely treated ( less than 30 days) with benznidazole due to adverse reactions ( ARs). A total of 472 patients started treatment with benznidazole during the study period. Of these , 118 ( 25 %) developed ARs that led to treatment discontinuation before 30 days of therapy. Fifty-three ( 53/118; 44.9 %) started nifurtimox as second-line treatment; most were women ( 79.3 %) , of Bolivian origin ( 98.1 %) , with a median age of 37.3 years ( IQR 29.8-43.2). The most common ARs with nifurtimox were cutaneous hypersensitivity<disease> ( 24.1 %); digestive disorders ( 22.2 %); fever<disease> ( 12.9 %); neurological disturbances ( 11.1 %); depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> or insomnia ( 9.2 %); dyspnoea ( 7.4 %); myalgia<symptom> ( 5.5 %); and dizziness<symptom> , asthenia<symptom> or malaise<symptom> ( 7.4 %). Twenty-six patients ( 26/53; 49.1 %) discontinued nifurtimox due to ARs , all of them before the required minimal therapy duration of 60 days. There were no deaths. Treatment of chronic Chagas disease relies on two drugs with a poor tolerability profile. In our cohort , 12.3 % of the patients who initiated benznidazole and subsequently nifurtimox , in case of non-tolerance , developed adverse reactions that led to permanent treatment discontinuation. Most were women of childbearing age , a group for whom therapy has the added benefit of interrupting vertical transmission.
