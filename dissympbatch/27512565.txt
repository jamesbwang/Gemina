  Appendiceal metastasis from lung cancer is rare. However , it often causes acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> that requires emergency surgery. We herein report a thought-provoking case of appendiceal metastasis from lung cancer. A 71-year-old man was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer with multiple metastases and underwent chemotherapy. One month later , he developed acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> , and laparoscopic appendectomy was promptly performed. A swollen appendix and pus collection were observed during surgery. Histological analysis revealed an invasive adenocarcinoma in the appendix that infiltrated the mucosal , submucosal , and muscular layers. Positive immunostaining of thyroid transcription factor 1 indicated appendiceal metastasis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma , not a primary appendiceal malignancy. The postoperative course was uneventful , and the patient 's pulmonary internist resumed continuous chemotherapy after surgery. Although appendiceal metastasis from pulmonary adenocarcinoma is rare , it often results in acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease>. Optimal therapy including emergency surgery should be performed without hesitation so that chemotherapy can be resumed as soon as possible.
