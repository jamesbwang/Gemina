  Despite aggressive therapeutic regimens , diffuse alveolar haemorrhage ( DAH) is still associated with a high mortality rate in systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE). This study was carried out in patients with SLE-associated DAH with a focus on their therapeutic modality. A retrospective review was performed in 839 Han Chinese lupus patients hospitalized for their DAH manifestation from May 2006 to December 2016. There were 24 episodes in 17 cases ( 2.0 % incidence) , 15 females and two males aged 19-67 years ( mean ± sd 38.2 ± 15.1 years). High disease activity ( Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 ( SLEDAI-2K) 12-31 , 19.8 ± 5.6) was found at the onset of DAH. All patients were treated with high-dose corticosteroid , followed by pulse methylprednisolone ( 70.6 %) , plasmapheresis ( 41.2 %) , pulse cyclophosphamide ( 35.3 %) , and rituximab ( 23.5 %). Six patients ( 35.3 %) , including three with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation , died owing to acute<disease> respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom>. All patients receiving rituximab treatment survived with a follow-up period of 12-58 months ( 40.8 ± 21.1 months) , and no further relapse was noted in three cases with a history of recurrent DAH episodes. In addition , there was a significant decrease in their lupus activity ( SLEDAI-2K 21.5 ± 6.0 to 6.3 ± 1.7 , p = 0.0286). In this single-centre series with SLE-associated DAH in Han Chinese patients , a beneficial effect of rituximab therapy was observed.
