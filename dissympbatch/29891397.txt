  Children up to 2 years old are at high risk of respiratory<disease> infections<disease> and nasal irrigation is often prescribed. Yet , to date there is no sufficient knowledge about its immediate effects on the nasopharynx and middle ear. Therefore , this study aimed to analyze the effect of a rhino-pharyngeal clearance intervention protocol on nasal obstruction and middle ear condition in children under 3 years of age with URTI. Randomized controlled trial in a day-care centre of Porto , including 44 children randomized to Intervention Group ( IG) and Control Group ( CG). Nasal auscultation and tympanometry were performed at baseline ( M0) as well as after the intervention ( M1) , which consisted of nasal irrigation ( NaCl .9 %) followed by a forced nasal inspiration in the IG , and after 30 min of normal activities , in the CG. In M1 there was a lower frequency of children classified as having an obstructed nasal sound<symptom> in the IG when compared to the CG ( IG = 33.3 %; CG = 68.4 %; p = 0.042). We also observed an improvement of mean peak pressure ( PP) in the IG ( Left ear: M0 = -124 daPa; M1 = -92 daPa; p = 0.022. Right ear: M0 = -102 daPa; M1 = -77 daPa; p = 0.021) , which was not observed in the CG ( Left ear: M0 = -105 daPa; M1 = -115 daPa; p = 0.485. Right ear: M0 = -105 daPa; M1 = -131 daPa; p = 0.105). There were no significant results concerning the compliance of the tympanic membrane. The rhino-pharyngeal clearance improved the nasal obstruction and PP of the middle ear of children under 3 years of age with URTI.
