  Discharge to rehabilitation is reported in large studies as one important outcome parameter based on hospital codes. Because neurologic outcome scores ( e.g. , the modified Rankin Scale ( mRS)) are missing in International Classification of Diseases ( ICD) databases , rehabilitation indirectly serves as a kind of surrogate parameter for overall outcome. Reported fractions of patients with rehabilitation , however , largely differ between studies and seem high for patients with aneurysm<disease> clipping. Variances in rehabilitation fractions seem to largely differ between treatments ( clipping versus coiling) for unruptured intracranial aneurysms<disease> , so we analyzed our patients for percentage of and potential factors predicting rehabilitation. From July 2007 to September 2013 , 100 consecutive patients with at least one cerebral aneurysm<disease> underwent aneurysm<disease> clipping. Aneurysms<disease> were classified as incidental , associated , pretreated ( coil compaction after subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom>) , and symptomatic ( oculomotor nerve compression , microemboli) , and they were assigned to their anatomical location. Complications ( infection , hemorrhage<symptom> , cerebrospinal fluid fistula<disease> , transient and permanent neurologic deficit , reoperation) and outcome ( mRS at 6 months; clip occlusion rate by postoperative digital subtraction angiography) as well as frequency and type of rehabilitation were analyzed and correlated retrospectively. Multiple aneurysms<disease> clipped in one procedure were not counted separately regarding complications or outcome ( i.e. , one patient , one outcome). The overall complication rate was 17 % including 10 % early and 3 % permanent neurologic deficits and 7 % reoperations. There were no deaths. Overall , 98 % of patients had a good outcome ( mRS 0-2). Clip occlusion rate was 97.9 %. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified aneurysm<disease> location as the only significant independent factor for risk of complication ( Microsurgery of unruptured and not acutely ruptured aneurysms<disease> ( including post-coil and associated aneurysms<disease>) has a low rate of rehabilitation with a low risk of a permanent neurologic deficit , long-term care , or early neurologic rehabilitation. The rate of rehabilitation is well below reported risks from studies based on ICD-based health care analysis. Rehabilitation per se is not a good indicator for outcome.
