  Hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT) is widely performed for neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. HCT involves intravenous infusion of hematopoietic progenitor cells from human leukocyte antigen ( HLA)- matched donor ( allogeneic) or from the patient ( autologous). Before HCT , the patient is prepared with high dose chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to destroy residual malignant cells and to reduce immunologic resistance. After HCT , chemotherapy is used to prevent graft rejection and graft versus host disease ( GvHD). Neurological complications are related to the type of HCT , underlying disease , toxicity of the conditioning regimens , immunosuppression caused by conditioning regimens , vascular complications generated by thrombocytopenia<symptom> and/or coagulopathy , GvHD and inappropriate immune response. In this review , neurological complications are presented according to time of onset after HCT: ( 1) early complications ( in the first month)- related to harvesting of stem cells , during conditioning ( drug toxicity , posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome<disease>) , related to pancytopenia , ( 2) intermediate phase complications ( second to sixth month)- central nervous system infections caused by prolonged neutropenia and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy due to JC virus , ( 3) late phase complications ( after sixth month)- neurological complications of GvHD , second neoplasms and relapses of the original disease.
