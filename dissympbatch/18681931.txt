  Reversible splenial lesion<symptom> syndrome<disease> ( RESLES) is a reversible condition with an excellent prognosis in most patients. The clinical features include altered states of consciousness<symptom> , delirium<symptom> , headache<symptom> , and seizures<symptom> , but no callosal disconnection syndromes<disease> have been described in RESLES. We presented a 57-year-old patient with alien hand syndrome<disease> , autotopagnosia , gait disorders , and left ideomotor apraxia after blood transfusion. The brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) showed a few regions with high signal intensity in the genu , body , and splenium of the right corpus callosum on diffusion weighted images. Cerebrovascular examination was unremarkable. He was diagnosed with RESLES and callosal disconnection syndrome<disease>. The patient received symptomatic and supportive treatment in our hospital. He recovered to baseline on following up of 6 months and abnormalities on brain MRI completely disappeared. Neurologists should be aware of the symptoms of callosal disconnection syndrome<disease> in RESLES. In addition , caution should be taken when transfusing blood products in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding.
