  Primary lung lymphoma ( PLL) is a rare type of lymphoma confined to the lung at the time of diagnosis. Pulmonary diffuse large B cells lymphoma ( P-DLBCL) is the second most common type of PLL and it usually appears radiologically as solitary or multiple nodules<symptom> or areas of consolidation. We present the case of a 63-year-old Caucasian male who developed severe<disease> acute<disease> respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> and diffuse ground glass opacities ( GGO) on chest computerized tomography. Diffuse GGO may be the radiological expression of very different diseases , ranging from infectious processes to interstitial lung diseases ( ILDs) and neoplastic diseases. In our case , pneumonia<disease> and de novo ILD were initially considered given the symptoms and past medical history. However , bronchoscopy with trans-bronchial biopsies demonstrated the presence of P-DLBCL , despite an unusual radiological presentation and negative cytological analyses on bronchoalveolar lavage. In conclusion , P-DLBCL should be considered among the many differential diagnoses of diffuse GGO.
