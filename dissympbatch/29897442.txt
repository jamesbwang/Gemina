  What is the effect of latent genital tuberculosis<disease> ( GTB) on ovarian reserve in infertile women? Women with latent GTB have lower ovarian reserves and yield lower numbers of oocytes in IVF. Limited evidence suggests that women with GTB may have a low ovarian reserve. Infertile women have a high incidence of latent GTB and treatment improves fertility outcomes. This prospective study from February 2013 to January 2016 compared 431 infertile women diagnosed with latent GTB ( Group I) to 453 infertile women without latent GTB ( Group II). The study was conducted at Shreyas Hospital , Kolhapur , India , a tertiary referral centre for infertility<symptom>. Women of both groups were 21-38 years of age. Group I consisted of infertile women with proven tubal patency but with latent GTB diagnosed by DNA PCR testing of an endometrial biopsy. Day 2-4 anti-Mullerian hormone ( AMH) and antral follicle count ( AFC) were assessed in both groups. All women with latent GTB took antituberculosis therapy ( ATT). Gonadotropin dosages and oocyte and embryo details were noted in both groups for those who underwent IVF. Women with latent GTB were younger ( 29.8 ± 4.4 years vs. 30.8 ± 4.5 years; P = 0.003) and , following adjustment for age , had significantly lower AMH ( Median ( IQR): 2 ( 0.9 , 4.1) ng/ml vs 2.8 ( 1.3 , 5) ng/ml; P = 0.01) and AFC ( Median ( IQR): 7 ( 5 , 11) vs 8 ( 5 , 14); P < 0.001). Post ATT , women with latent GTB yielded fewer oocytes ( 9.3 ± 7.6 vs. 10.9 ± 8.1; P = 0.01) , but had more grade I embryos transferred ( 1.1 ± 0.5 vs. 0.89 ± 1.0; P = 0.001) and a better implantation rate ( 26.8 % vs. 17.5 %; P = 0.004) in IVF compared to women in Group II. Group I had a higher pregnancy rate compared to Group II ( 51.6 % vs. 40.5 %; P = 0.001) , through various treatment modalities. Considering the adequacy of the sample size and use of robust ovarian reserve markers , the role of chance is minimal. The study is limited to an infertile population visiting a tertiary referral centre. The mechanisms by which latent GTB infection would lead to ovarian damage are unclear. It is believed that latent GTB is without any clinical significance. However , a low ovarian reserve in young women with latent GTB necessitates considering it as a cause of infertility<symptom> , in women with prolonged infertility<symptom>. These women may experience an accelerated decline in ovarian reserve with reduced success in achieving biological parenthood. Clinicians must be aware of this condition and its consequences while managing infertility<symptom>. This study was funded by Sushrut Assisted Conception Clinic , Shreyas Hospital , Kolhapur , India.
