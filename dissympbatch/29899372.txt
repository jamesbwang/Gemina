  PTPN23 encodes a ubiquitously expressed non-receptor type , catalytically inactive protein-tyrosine phosphatase found in all cells including neurons. Recently , we have identified PTPN23 in a cellular screen for the systematic identification of novel regulators of survival motor neuron ( SMN) function in the assembly of splicing factors ( Uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins , UsnRNPs). Based on three families , recessive PTPN23 variants have been associated with human<disease> disease<disease> tentatively , without functional studies. Here , we describe a pediatric proband with severe developmental delay , epilepsy , cortical blindness<symptom> , hypomyelination and brain atrophy on MRI. Whole exome sequencing and family study showed two novel PTPN23 variants , c. 1902C > G ( p. ( Asn634Lys)) and c. 2974delC ( p. ( Leu992Tyrfs * 168)) , in compound heterozygous state , which are predicted in silico to be damaging. When studying patient 's fibroblasts we found similar expression of SMN but a dramatic reduction of cells displaying SMN accumulation in Cajal bodies ( CB). SMN strongly accumulated in CB in more than 50 % of unrelated control cell fibroblasts as well as in fibroblasts from the parent carrying only the c. 2974delC ( p. ( Leu992Tyrfs * 168)) variant ( predicted to cause loss-of-function). In contrast , only 22 % of cells showed respective SMN accumulations in patient fibroblasts ( p = 1.9-2.5 Ã— 10
