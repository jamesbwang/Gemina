  Interpersonal relationships contribute to the psychological adjustments to chronic<disease> disease<disease> , directly affecting health and , more generally , life satisfaction of patients. Those factors are often threatened by the fear of becoming target of prejudices and discrimination from those who share their daily life with. Thus , this study proposes a contribution to the Italian adaptation and validation of the Chronic Illness Anticipated Stigma Scale ( CIASS) , a brief questionnaire ( 12 items) that aims to assess perceived stigma of chronic illness patients in family , work and health care contexts. 279 chronic illness patients have completed the questionnaire , comparing the scores with those obtained in depression<symptom> ( BDI-II) , anxiety<symptom> ( STAI) , and internalized stigma scales. Confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA) on the Italian sample has shown the same structure of the original questionnaire , composed by three dimensions of anticipated stigma , experienced with family and friends , work colleagues and health care providers. Correlation analyses confirm the relation between scores of anticipated stigma and other mental health indicators as anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> Italian version of CIASS demonstrates to be a valid and reliable instrument , considering it both as an indicator of person 's state of health and a promising marker of the specific kind of perceived discrimination in family , care and working contexts.
