  Purpose To validate the feasibility and efficacy of intratumoral radiofrequency hyperthermia<symptom> ( RFH)- enhanced herpes<disease> simplex<disease> virus ( HSV) thymidine kinase ( TK) and ganciclovir ( GCV) ( hereafter , HSV-TK/GCV) gene therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). Materials and Methods This study was performed from November 11 , 2015 , to April 14 , 2017 , and included ( a) in vitro experiments with human NSCLC cells to establish the proof of principle , ( b) in vivo experiments using mice with subcutaneous NSCLC to further demonstrate the principle , and ( c) in vivo experiments using rats with orthotopic NSCLC to validate the technical feasibility. Cells , nude mice , and nude rats were randomly divided into four groups ( six animals per group): ( a) combination therapy ( HSV-TK/GCV combined with RFH) , ( b) RFH , ( c) HSV-TK/GCV , and ( d) phosphate-buffered saline. Data were analyzed by using the Dunnett t test or Kruskal-Wallis test. Results For in vitro experiments , the cell proliferation assay showed significantly diminished viable cells with combination therapy ( mean , 0.56; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.44 , 0.68) versus RFH ( mean , 0.89; 95 % CI: 0.82 , 0.97) , HSV-TK/GCV ( mean , 0.71; 95 % CI: 0.56 , 0.86) , and phosphate-buffered saline ( mean , 1; 95 % CI: 1 , 1) ( P < .05 for all). For in vivo experiments , optical imaging showed significantly decreased relative bioluminescence signal with combination therapy ( mean , 0.71 ( 95 % CI: 0.03 , 1.39) in mice; 1.29 ( 95 % CI: 0.51 , 2.06) in rats) compared with RFH ( mean , 2.66 ( 95 % CI: 1.73 , 3.59) in mice; 2.26 ( 95 % CI: 1.51 , 3.01) in rats) , HSV-TK/GCV ( mean , 1.37 ( 95 % CI: 0.65 , 2.08) in mice; 1.76 ( 95 % CI: 1.20 , 2.31) in rats) , and phosphate-buffered saline ( mean , 3.07 ( 95 % CI: 2.50 , 3.65) in mice; 2.94 ( 95 % CI: 2.29 , 3.58) in rats) ( P < .001 for all). US showed that the smallest relative tumor volumes occurred with combination therapy ( mean , 0.60; 95 % CI: 0.15 , 1.05) versus RFH ( mean , 2.43; 95 % CI: 1.80 , 3.06) , HSV-TK/GCV ( mean , 1.32; 95 % CI: 0.75 , 1.89) , and phosphate-buffered saline ( mean , 2.56; 95 % CI: 1.75 , 3.38) ( P < .05 for all) in the mouse subcutaneous model. Conclusion Intratumoral radiofrequency hyperthermia-enhanced herpes<disease> simplex<disease> virus thymidine kinase and ganciclovir gene therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer is feasible and can be guided by molecular imaging.
