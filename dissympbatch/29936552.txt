  The antiphospholipid syndrome<disease> ( APS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies , which may trigger vascular thrombosis with consecutive infarcts. However , cognitive dysfunctions representing one of the most commonest neuropsychiatric symptoms are frequently present despite the absence of any ischemic brain lesions<symptom>. Data on the structural and functional basis of the neuropsychiatric symptoms are sparse. To examine the effect of APS on hippocampal neurogenesis and on white matter , we induced experimental APS ( eAPS) in adult female Balb/C mice by immunization with Î²2-glycoprotein 1. To investigate cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus granular cell layer ( DG GCL) , eAPS and control mice ( n = 5 , each) were injected with 5-bromo-2 '- deoxyuridine ( BrdU) once a day for 10 subsequent days. Sixteen weeks after immunization , eAPS resulted in a significant reduction of BrdU-positive cells in the DG GCL compared to control animals. However , double staining with doublecortin and NeuN revealed a largely preserved neurogenesis. Ultrastructural analysis of corpus callosum ( CC) axons in eAPS ( n = 6) and control mice ( n = 7) revealed no significant changes in CC axon diameter or g-ratio. In conclusion , decreased cellular proliferation in the hippocampus of eAPS mice indicates a limited regenerative potential and may represent one neuropathological substrate of cognitive changes in APS while evidence for alterations of white matter integrity is lacking.
