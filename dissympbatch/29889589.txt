  Volanesorsen , an investigational inhibitor of apoC-III synthesis , significantly reduced triglyceride levels in clinical trials in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome<disease> ( FCS) , a rare genetic disorder characterized by marked chylomicronemia leading to a spectrum of symptoms , including recurrent abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and episodes of potentially fatal acute pancreatitis<disease> ( AP). To determine the effect of volanesorsen on burden of disease on patients with FCS Methods: ReFOCUS was a retrospective global web-based survey open to patients with FCS who received volanesorsen for â‰¥ 3 months in an open-label extension study. The survey included questions about patients ' experiences before and after volanesorsen treatment. Twenty-two respondents had received volanesorsen for a median of 222 days. Volanesorsen significantly reduced the number of symptoms per patient across physical , emotional , and cognitive domains. Significant reductions from baseline were reported for steatorrhea , pancreatic pain , and constant worry about an attack of pain/AP. Respondents reported that volanesorsen improved overall management of symptoms and reduced interference of FCS with work/school responsibilities. Reductions in the negative impact of FCS on personal , social , and professional life were also reported. Treatment with volanesorsen has the potential to reduce disease burden in patients with FCS through modulation of multiple symptom domains.
