  Deep brain stimulation ( DBS) has been offered to patients suffering of severe and resistant neuropsychiatric disorders like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD) , Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome<disease> ( TS) and Major Depression<symptom> ( MDD). Modulation of several targets within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits can lead to a decrease of symptom severity in those patients. This review focuses on the recent clinical outcomes in DBS in psychiatric disorders. Studies on OCD and TS are now focusing on the long-term effects of DBS , with encouraging results regarding not only the decrease of symptoms , but also quality of life. They also highlighted efficient adjuvant techniques , like cognitive and behavioural therapy and support programs , to enhance an often-partial response to DBS. The application of DBS for MDD is more recent and , despite encouraging initial open-label studies , two large randomised studies have failed to demonstrate an efficacy of DBS in MDD according to evidence-based medicine criteria. Last years , DBS was also tested in other resistant psychiatric disorders , as anorexia<symptom> nervosa and addiction , with encouraging preliminary results. However , today , no target- whatever the disease- can meet the criteria for clinical efficacy as recently defined by an international committee for neurosurgery for psychiatric disorders. Consequently , DBS in psychiatric disorders still needs to proceed within the frame of clinical trials.
