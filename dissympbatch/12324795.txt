  This study aimed at investigating dental clinicians ' preferences on management of necrotic pulp with acute apical abscess<disease> ( NPAAA) cases. Following an ethical approval and two pilot studies , an electronic survey was emailed to 400 general dental practitioners ( GDPs) and 56 endodontists. The email explained the study 's methods and assured that participants ' identities and information given would remain anonymous and confidential. A reminder email was sent after eight weeks. Responses were collected and data were analyzed using the Chi-square test at p = 0.05. The majority of respondents ( 86.3 %) would deal with NPAAA cases `` differently '' from vital-pulp ones ( p < 0.001). More endodontists ( 40 %) used two or three irrgants than GDPs ( 29.5 %). Whilst the highest proportion of endodontists ( 29.7 %) rarely prescribed antibiotics , the highest proportion of GDPs ( 26 %) generally did so ( p < 0.001). Whilst the highest proportion of GDPs ( 26.9 %) over-instrumented the largest canal in the first visit , most endodontists ( 56.8 %) performed complete cleaning & shaping ( C&S) ( p < 0.001). In cases of non-stopped exudates<symptom> , whilst the highest proportions of endodontists would either let the patient wait till the exudates<symptom> significantly reduce then continue their intended approach ( 40.5 %) or insert ICMs and temporize the tooth ( 40.5 %) , the highest proportion of GDPs ( 30.8 %) would insert only dry cotton pellet without temporizing the tooth ( p = 0.002). Of those who would leave the tooth open if non-stopped exudates<symptom> presents in the first visit , the majority ( 81.9 %) would temporize the tooth if little exudates<symptom> present after C&S ( p < 0.001). Clinicians , especially GDPs , opted to treat teeth involved in NPAAA differently from those with vital-pulp , such as: were using different ICMs and irrigants , C&S to different apical size preparation. GDPs should improve their practice by implementing multi-irrigants protocol while C&S , limit prescribing antibiotics , perform complete debridement of the root canal system and not to leave the tooth open between visits. Clinicians , especially GDPs , relied on their own experiences in managing NPAA cases which necessitates scientific-based guidelines.
