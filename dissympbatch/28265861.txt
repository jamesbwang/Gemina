  The term `` tissue kallikrein '' is used to describe a group of serine proteases shared considerable sequence homology and colocalize in the same chromosomal locus 19q13. 2-q13.4. It has been widely discovered in various tissues and has been proved to be involved in kinds of pathophysiological processes , such as inhibiting oxidative stress , inflammation<symptom> , apoptosis , fibrosis<disease> and promoting angiogenesis , and neurogenesis. Human Urinary Kallidinogenase ( HUK) extracted from human urine is a member of tissue kallikrein which could convert kininogen to kinin and hence improve the plasma kinin level. Medical value of HUK has been widely investigated in China , especially on acute ischemic stroke. In this review , we will summarize the therapeutic values of Human Urinary Kallidinogenase on acute ischemic stroke and its potential mechanisms.
