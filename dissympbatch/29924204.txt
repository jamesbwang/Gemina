  This report describes the use of Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty for the management of endothelial decompensation after multifocal intraocular lens implantation. In this retrospective study , we reviewed and assessed the surgical outcomes of 9 patients ( 9 eyes) who underwent Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty after multifocal intraocular lens implantation. Corneal edema<symptom> occurred due to Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy ( n = 3) , pseudophakic bullous keratopathy ( n = 3) , Descemet 's membrane detachment ( n = 2) , and toxic anterior segment syndrome<disease> ( n = 1). The Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty surgeries were uneventful in all eyes , but rebubbling procedures were necessary in 2 eyes. One month after the surgery , all the corneas<symptom> were clear. After 6 months , excluding 1 eye with amblyopia , the mean distance corrected visual acuity was 0.10 logMAR , with all eyes achieving 0.18 logMAR or better. This is the first report of Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty after multifocal intraocular lens implantation , and it suggests that good results can be achieved without multifocal intraocular lens exchange.
