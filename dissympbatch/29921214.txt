  Sepsis<disease> , a serious and life threatening complication arising from infection caused by lipopolysaccharide , is a complex inflammatory syndrome<disease> , and one of the main causes of death in intensive care units ( ICU). It is characterized as an over-response of pro-coagulant agents promotes coagulopathy and thrombus formation , resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC). Furthermore , it can cause multiple organ dysfunction and hypotension<symptom> ( septic shock<symptom>) resulting in death. Thrombocytopenia<symptom> , which is a hallmark of sepsis<disease> , is strongly correlated as a negative marker of the infection. Additionally , platelets contribute with the oxidative stress in septic patients in order to exterminate the microbial pathogen. This review summarises the important role of platelets in the pathology of sepsis<disease> , and highlights potential treatment targets to improve the outcome of sceptic patients. The search was performed in PubMed , books and retrieved journal articles for a period of three months. The figures were developed through Servier Medical Arts software. The exact treatment of sepsis<disease> is still the subject of considerable debate. Although here we presented several therapies that have shown promise for improving the outcome of patients , researching platelet function in sepsis<disease> has provided us targets to develop new medical approaches focusing specially on thrombocytopenia<symptom> and DIC.
