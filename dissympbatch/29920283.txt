  Acute kidney injury ( AKI) is a common complication following severe sepsis<disease> , its incidence is increasing , and it is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Rutin is a glycoside of the bioflavonoid quercetin with various protective effects due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential. In this research , we tried to assess the protective effect of rutin administration in a model of AKI in C57BL/6 mice. For induction of AKI , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) was injected once ( 10 mg/kg , i.p.) and rutin was p.o. given at doses of 50 or 200 mg/kg. Treatment of LPS-challenged group with rutin lowered serum level of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen ( BUN) , restored to some extent renal oxidative stress-related indices such as malondialdehyde ( MDA) , glutathione ( GSH) , and activity of superoxide dismutase ( SOD) and catalase. In addition , rutin brought back renal nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-κB) , toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX2) , sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1) , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α ( TNFα) , interleukin-6 , and caspase 3 activity to their control levels. Moreover , protective effect of rutin was in accordance to a dose-dependent manner. Collectively , rutin is capable to mitigate LPS-induced AKI via appropriate modulation of renal oxidative stress , inflammation<symptom> , and apoptosis.
