  To describe the vestibular function in patients with superficial siderosis of the central nervous system ( SSCN). Retrospective analysis. Tertiary referral center. Ten consecutive patients with SSCN. This study is the largest case series of SSCN in which detailed neuro-otological findings , including electronystagmography recording , video head impulse test ( vHIT) , and posturography , were described. Audiological and neuro-otological examinations , including pure-tone audiometry , distortion product otoacoustic emissions , speech audiometry , auditory brainstem responses , electronystagmography recording , vHIT , and posturography. Pure-tone average , DP level , maximum speech discrimination score , interpeak latency between auditory brainstem responses waves I and V , eye tracking test , examination of optokinetic nystagmus<symptom> , caloric response , visual suppression , vestibulo-ocular reflex gains , total center of pressure path length , and Romberg 's ratio. Audiological examinations suggested that the sensorineural hearing loss was of a cochlear etiology in 3 ears<disease> , a retrocochlear etiology in 11 ears<disease> , and a combined cochlear and retrocochlear etiology in 6 ears<disease>. Neuro-otological examinations revealed that eight out of nine patients had cerebellar disorders , while all patients also had peripheral vestibular dysfunction. In addition to cerebellar disorders , SSCN patients suffer from severe peripheral vestibular dysfunction , which can exacerbate the patient 's imbalance. When otolaryngologists encounter patients with distinctly progressive sensorineural hearing loss and imbalance , they should include SSCN in the differential diagnosis and perform neuro-otological examinations , including an electronystagmography recording and vHIT and brain magnetic resonance imaging.
