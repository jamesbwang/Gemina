  We sought to determine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of frequency of sauna bathing with high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP) , fibrinogen , leucocyte count and gamma-glutamyltransferase ( GGT). Baseline sauna bathing habits were assessed in 2269 men aged 42-61 years. Concentrations of hsCRP , fibrinogen , leucocyte count , and GGT were determined at baseline and 11 years later. The associations of sauna bathing frequency with baseline and 11-year hsCRP , fibrinogen , leucocyte count , and GGT levels were examined using robust multivariate regression analyses. In baseline analysis , 4-7 sauna sessions/week ( compared with 1 sauna session/week) was associated with -0.84 mg/l ( 95 % CI , -1.55 , -0.14; p = .019) lower hsCRP; -0.07 g/l ( 95 % CI , -0.15 , 0.02; p = .112) lower fibrinogen; and -0.28 Ã— 10 Observational evidence supports the hypothesis that reduction in inflammation<symptom> may be one of the pathways linking frequent sauna bathing with decreased risk of acute and chronic<disease> disease<disease> conditions. KEY MESSAGES Cross-sectional evidence or short-term studies suggest Finnish sauna bathing may exert its beneficial health effects via reduction in inflammation<symptom> and oxidative stress; however , the long-term effects of sauna bathing on these outcomes are uncertain. In this population-based prospective cohort study , frequent sauna sessions significantly decreased levels of inflammatory markers at baseline and 11-year follow-up; but had no effect on oxidative stress. The health benefits of sauna bathing may in part be mediated via reduced systemic
