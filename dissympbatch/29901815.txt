  To characterize the dose-exposure-response relationship of sirukumab , an anti-interleukin 6 human monoclonal antibody , in the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) , we conducted exposure-response ( E-R) modeling analyses based on data from two pivotal phase 3 placebo-controlled trials of sirukumab in patients with RA who were inadequate responders to nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or anti-tumor necrosis<symptom> factor Î± agents. A total of 2176 patients were included for the analyses and received subcutaneous administration of either placebo or sirukumab 50 mg every 4 weeks or 100 mg every 2 weeks. The clinical endpoints were 20 % , 50 % , and 70 % improvement in the American College of Rheumatology response criteria ( ie , ACR20 , ACR50 , and ACR70) , and 28-joint Disease Activity Index Score ( DAS28) using C-reactive protein. To provide a thorough assessment of the sirukumab E-R relationship , 2 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling approaches were implemented , including joint longitudinal modeling ( ie , indirect response modeling of the time course of the 2 clinical endpoints) and landmark analyses ( ie , direct linking of selected pharmacokinetic parameters to response at week 16 or 24). Results from both modeling analyses were generally consistent , and collectively suggested that the sirukumab subcutaneous dose of 50 mg every 4 weeks would produce near-maximal efficacy. No covariates identified in the E-R modeling analyses would have a significant impact on dose-response. Despite body<symptom> weight and comorbid diabetes having significant effect on sirukumab exposure , simulations suggested that their effect on efficacy was small. Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of sirukumab E-R to support dose recommendations in patients with RA.
