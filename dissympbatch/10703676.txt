  The high mortality and cardiovascular disease ( CVD) burden in patients with end-stage renal disease ( ESRD) is well-documented. Recent literature suggests that acute kidney injury is also associated with CVD. It is unknown whether patients with incident ESRD due to dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury ( AKI-D) are at higher short-term risk for death and CVD events , compared with incident ESRD patients without preceding AKI-D. Few studies have examined the impact of recovery from AKI-D on subsequent CVD risk. In this retrospective cohort study , we evaluated adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who initiated dialysis from January 2009 to September 2015. Preceding AKI-D and subsequent outcomes of death and CVD events ( acute coronary syndrome<disease> , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack) were identified from electronic health records. We performed multivariable Cox regression models adjusting for demographics , comorbidities , medication use , and laboratory results. Compared to incident ESRD patients who experienced AKI-D ( n = 1865) , patients with ESRD not due to AKI-D ( n = 3772) had significantly lower adjusted rates of death ( adjusted hazard ratio ( aHR) 0.56 , 95 % CI: 0.47-0.67) and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> hospitalization ( aHR 0.45 , 0.30-0.70). Compared to AKI-D patients who did not recover and progressed to ESRD , AKI-D patients who recovered ( n = 1347) had a 30 % lower adjusted relative rate of death ( aHR 0.70 , 0.55-0.88). Patients who transition to ESRD via AKI-D are a high-risk subgroup that may benefit from aggressive monitoring and medical management , particularly for heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Recovery from AKI-D is independently associated with lower short-term mortality.
