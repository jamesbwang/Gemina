  Acute compartment syndrome<disease> ( ACS) is an orthopedic emergency condition , which is rarely attributed to burns. It occurs when pressure in an enclosed space rises to a point where it reduces blood flow and impairs tissue perfusion. Its consequences often lead to ischemia and possible necrosis<symptom> within that space. Until now , the use of Doppler assessment to explore different types of compartment syndrome<disease> has yielded contradictory findings. Here , we present a significant increase of blood flow velocity in the arteries proximal to the burned area. Thus , the combination of Duplex ultrasound results with clinical findings will help vascular surgeons to make immediate decision to perform fasciotomy.
