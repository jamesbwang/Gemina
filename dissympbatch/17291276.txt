  Wound<disease> healing is a complex and dynamic process that progresses through the distinct phases of hemostasis , inflammation<symptom> , proliferation , and remodeling. Both inflammation<symptom> and re-epithelialization , in which skin γδ T cells are heavily involved , are required for efficient skin wound<disease> healing. Dendritic epidermal T cells ( DETCs) , which reside in murine epidermis , are activated to secrete epidermal cell growth factors , such as IGF-1 and KGF-1/ 2 , to promote re-epithelialization after skin injury. Epidermal IL-15 is not only required for DETC homeostasis in the intact epidermis but it also facilitates the activation and IGF-1 production of DETC after skin injury. Further , the epidermal expression of IL-15 and IGF-1 constitutes a feedback regulatory loop to promote wound<disease> repair. Dermis-resident Vγ4 T cells infiltrate into the epidermis at the wound<disease> edges through the CCR6-CCL20 pathway after skin injury and provide a major source of IL-17A , which enhances the production of IL-1β and IL-23 in the epidermis to form a positive feedback loop for the initiation and amplification of local inflammation<symptom> at the early stages of wound<disease> healing. IL-1β and IL-23 suppress the production of IGF-1 by DETCs and , therefore , impede wound<disease> healing. A functional loop may exist among Vγ4 T cells , epidermal cells , and DETCs to regulate wound<disease> repair.
