  Despite NUDT15 variants showing significant association with thiopurine-induced adverse events ( AEs) in Asians , it remains unclear which variants of NUDT15 or whether additional genetic variants should be tested to predict AEs. To clarify the best pharmacogenetic test to be used clinically , we performed association studies of NUDT15 variants and haplotypes with AEs , genome-wide association study ( GWAS) to discover additional variants , and ROC analysis to select the model to predict severe AEs. Overall , 2630 patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) were enrolled and genotyped for NUDT15 codon 139; 1291 patients were treated with thiopurines. diplotypes were analyzed in 970 patients , and GWASs of AEs were performed with 1221 patients using population-optimized genotyping array and imputation. We confirmed the association of NUDT15 p.Arg139Cys with leukopenia<symptom> and alopecia ( p = 2.20E-63 , 1.32E-69 , OR = 6.59 , 12.1 , respectively) , and found a novel association with digestive symptoms ( p = 6.39E-04 , OR = 1.89). Time to leukopenia<symptom> was significantly shorter , and when leukopenia<symptom> was diagnosed , thiopurine doses were significantly lower in Arg/Cys and Cys/Cys than in Arg/Arg. In GWASs , no additional variants were found to be associated with thiopurine-induced AEs. Despite strong correlation of leukopenia<symptom> frequency with estimated enzyme activities based on the diplotypes ( r Genotyping of NUDT15 codon 139 was sufficient to predict acute<disease> severe<symptom> leukopenia<symptom> and alopecia in Japanese patients with IBD.
