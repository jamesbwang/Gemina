  Nivolumab , a new immune checkpoint inhibitor that has been found to improve outcomes for patients with some advanced cancers , is being increasingly used. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause immune-related adverse events , including dermatitis<disease> , enterocolitis<disease> , hepatitis<disease> and hypophysitis , but adrenal insufficiency rarely occurs. We present a case of Nivolumab-induced adrenal insufficiency in a man who complained of refractory hypotension<symptom>. A 52-year-old man with non-small cell lung cancer visited our emergency department complaining of fatigue<symptom> and diarrhea<disease> He had received Nivolumab every 2 weeks as third-line therapy for a total of 10 times. On arrival , his vital signs revealed shock<symptom>: blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , 68/48 mmHg; heart rate , 141 beats per minutes. Laboratory examination showed severe hemoconcentration with a hemoglobin level of 19.9 g/dL , normal electrolyte levels and hyperglycemia. We started intravenous infusion of 4.5 L of extracellular fluid , but his vital signs remained unstable. After admission , endocrine examination revealed abnormally low values of serum cortisol ( 4.86 μg/dL) and ACTH ( < 1.0 pg/mL) , which had been normal at 2 months before admission ( 21.14 μg/dL and 20.1 pg/mL , respectively). We therefore made a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency induced by Nivolumab and administered 100 mg hydrocortisone succinate sodium intravenously. He recovered soon after hydrocortisone replacement therapy. Nivolumab is a new immune checkpoint inhibitor and general physicians are not familiar with it. However , adverse events caused by Nivolumab , especially adrenal insufficiency , can lead to serious adverse outcomes if overlooked. We should recognize Nivolumab-induced adrenal insufficiency and administer a glucocorticoid immediately in cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
