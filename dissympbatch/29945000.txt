  To report a single-center experience with endovascular treatment of ruptured proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery ( PICA) aneurysms<disease>. Between January 2007 and December 2016 , among 1403 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> , 15 with ruptured proximal PICA aneurysms<disease> underwent endovascular embolization at our institution. Aneurysmal obliteration with a single microcatheter was performed in 9 patients. Additional microcatheter or stent-assisted coil embolization was performed in 4 patients and parent artery occlusion in 2 patients. Immediate angiographic results showed 10 complete occlusions ( 66.7 % , 10/15). Five patients showed incomplete occlusion ( remnant neck in 4 patients , remnant aneurysm<disease> in 1). Of those , 2 patients experienced recurrence and required conversion to microsurgical clipping. The remaining 2 patients remained in relatively stable condition. Procedure-related complications occurred in 3 patients ( 20 % , with thromboembolic complications in 2 patients and intraprocedural rupture in 1). Clinical outcome was excellent: Glasgow Outcome Score 4 or 5 in 12 of 15 patients ( 80 %). There was no rebleeding during follow-up. Ruptured proximal PICA aneurysms<disease> may be effectively treated with endovascular coil embolization. A variety of coil embolization techniques are required to obliterate an aneurysm<disease> without parent artery occlusion. Given that recurrence is possible , follow-up is required. Surgical clipping can be performed for recurrence with a relatively low risk of complications , because the aneurysm<disease> is unruptured. Coil embolization of a proximal PICA aneurysm<disease> in the acute phase can be a good treatment modality with good patient outcomes.
