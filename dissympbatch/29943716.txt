  Murine typhus<disease> ( MT) is an important cause of febrile illness in endemic areas , and there is an epidemiologic resurgence of this infection currently transpiring in Texas and California. Fatal cases and severe neurological complications are rare. A fatal case of MT in a middle-aged man is reported with a course culminating in multi-organ failure and refractory status epilepticus. An autopsy revealed hemorrhagic pneumonia<disease> , acute tubular necrosis<symptom> , and ischemic<symptom> necrosis<symptom> in the liver , adrenals , and brain. We have also reviewed the neurologic complications of MT.
