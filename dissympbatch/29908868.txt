  To present a original technique of robotic-assisted urethra-sparing simple prostatectomy ( RAUSP) for treating patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> ( BPH). From Apr 2015 to Dec 2016 , 27 patients underwent RAUSP via an extraperitoneal approach. Baseline patient characteristics , perioperative outcomes , pathological outcomes , postoperative clavien complications , International Prostate Symptom Score , International Index of Erectile Function and ejaculatory function were assessed. Twenty-six patients ( 96.3 %) successfully underwent RAUSP , one patient ( 3.7 %) was converted to simple prostatectomy. Median operative time was 169 mins ( interquartile range: 150-185); median estimated blood<symptom> loss<symptom> was 235 ml ( interquartile range: 180-300). Seven cases ( 26.9 %) required urethral repair secondary to inadvertent urethrotomy.. Mean catheterization time was 1.6 days ( range 1-5). Clavien complications were reported , 6 being low grade ( grade 1 or 2) with a single 3a complication ( gross hematuria<symptom> requiring bladder irrigation). Mean follow-up duration was 16.4 months ( range 9-30). Post-operative questionnaire demonstrated that IPSS ( p < 0.001) and QOL score ( p < 0.001) were significantly improved postoperatively. A total of 14 patients reported erectile function , 13 of which had normal ejaculation , only 1 complained retrograde ejaculation. RAUSP is technically feasible for patients with BPH. Our data indicate that patients have short catheterization time , an acceptable risk profile , significantly improvements of voiding function and maintaining antegrade ejaculation following this urethral- sparing technique.
