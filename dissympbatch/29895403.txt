  A major goal of burn management is to reduce the progression of necrosis<symptom> in the zone of ischemia surrounding the central zone of necrosis<symptom>. A rat comb burn model is often used to assess the progression of necrosis<symptom> in the zone of ischemia. We compared various combinations of naproxen ( NPX) , N-acetyl cysteine ( NAC) , and tadalafil ( TD) ( a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor used as a vasodilator to treat erectile dysfunction) in a rat comb burn model to determine their effects on injury progression. We created two comb burns on the backs of 40 anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats using a brass comb with four rectangular prongs preheated in boiling water and applied for 30s , resulting in four rectangular 10 × 20 mm full-thickness burns separated by three 5 × 20 mm unburned interspaces , representing the ischemic zones. We randomized five animals each to daily oral gavage with TD ( 1mg/kg) , NPX ( 10mg/kg) , NAC ( 500mg/kg) , NAC+NPX , TD+NPX , TD+NAC , TD+NPX+NAC , or normal saline ( NS). Wounds<disease> were observed daily for gross evidence of necrosis<symptom> in the unburned interspaces and full-thickness biopsies from the interspaces were evaluated with Hematoxylin & Eosin seven days after injury for histological evidence of necrosis<symptom>. The percentages of interspaces with histological evidence of necrosis<symptom> at day seven were TD-40 % , NPX-93 % , NAC-97 % , NS-87 % , TD+NPX -50 % , TD+NAC -40 % , TD+NPX+NAC -33 % , and NPX+NAC -60 % ( P < 0.001). Repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated reduced gross percentage of interspace area undergoing necrosis<symptom> in all groups that included TD , compared with all groups not including TD ( P < 0.001). There were no differences among the various treatments within the groups that did or did not include TD. Daily oral therapy with tadalafil reduces necrosis<symptom> in the unburned interspaces compared with naproxen , NAC , or their combination in a rat comb burn model. Addition of naproxen or NAC to tadalafil does not further reduce injury progression.
