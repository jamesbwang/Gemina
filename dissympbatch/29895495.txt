  Flavonoids are naturally occurring compounds , extensively distributed in plants. T helper ( Th) 1 and Th2 cytokines balance<symptom> plays an essential role in the reaction of inflammatory , allergic and infectious processes and transplantation rejection. This systematic review focuses on various classes of flavonoids with a view to evaluate whether Th1/Th2 cytokine-mediated pathways of immunoenhancement could reduce immune overwhelming reactions. Articles in English published from inception to December 2017 reporting flavonoids with immunomodulatory activity for the management of immune-mediated disorders were acquired from PubMed , EMBASE , Scopus and Web of Science and a animal experiments where Th1 and Th2 cytokines were investigated to assess the outcome of immunoregulatory therapy were included. 1809 publications were identified and 26 were included in this review. Ten articles described the effect of flavonoids on allergic inflammation<symptom> in an animal model of asthma; eleven in vivo studies evaluated the immunomodulating and immunosuppressive effects of flavonoids on Th1/Th2 cytokines production and five reports described the regulatory role of flavonoids for Th1/Th2 cytokine responses to experimental arthritis<disease> and myocarditis<disease> Modulation of Th1/Th2 cytokine balance<symptom> , inhibition of eosinophil accumulation and remodeling of the airways and lungs , downregulation of Notch and PI3K signaling pathways , regulation of CD4 +/ CD8 + lymphocytes ratio and decreasing inflammatory mediator expressions levels are among the most important immunopharmacological mechanisms for the retrieved flavonoids. Naturally occurring flavonoids discussed in the present article have optimal immunomodulation to prevent immune-mediated disorders through management of Th1/Th2 cytokine
