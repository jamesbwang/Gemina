  Toll-interacting protein ( Tollip) deficiency has been implicated in complex inflammatory and infectious<disease> diseases<disease> whose mechanisms are poorly understood. Comparing the gene expression profiles of WT and Tollip-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts , we observed here that Tollip deficiency selectively reduces the expression of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 ( IL-6) , IL-12 , and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α ( TNFα) , but potentiates the expression of fatty acid-binding protein 4 ( FABP4) in these cells. We also observed that expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha ( HIF1α) is reduced , whereas that of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 ( STAT5) is elevated , in Tollip-deficient cells , correlating with the decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines and increased expression of FABP4 in these cells. We further found that the CUE domain of Tollip is required for stimulating HIF1α activity , as Tollip CUE-domain mutant cells exhibited reduced levels of HIF1α and selected cytokines. Tollip is known to mediate autophagy and lysosome fusion , and herein we observed that Tollip 's autophagy function is required for modulating STAT5 and FABP4 expression. Bafilamycin A , an inhibitor of lysosome fusion , enhanced STAT5 and FABP4 expression in WT fibroblasts , while torin 2 , an activator of autophagy , reduced STAT5 and FABP4 expression in Tollip-deficient fibroblasts. Taken together , our study reveals that Tollip differentially modulates HIF1α and STAT5 expression in fibroblasts , potentially explaining the complex and context-dependent contribution of Tollip to disease development.
