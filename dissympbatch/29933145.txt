  Heterozygous de novo or inherited pathogenic variants in the PCDH19 gene cause a spectrum of neurodevelopmental features including developmental delay and seizures<symptom>. PCDH19 epilepsy was previously known as `` epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females '' , since the condition almost exclusively affects females. It is hypothesized that the co-existence of two populations of neurons , some with and some without PCDH19 protein expression , results in pathologically abnormal interactions between these neurons , a mechanism also referred to as cellular interference. Consequently , PCDH19-related epilepsies are inherited in an atypical X-linked pattern , such that hemizygous , non-mosaic , 46 , XY males are typically unaffected , while individuals with a disease-causing PCDH19 variant , mainly heterozygous females and mosaic males , are affected. As a corollary to this hypothesis , an individual with Klinefelter syndrome<disease> ( KS) ( 47 , XXY) who has a heterozygous disease-causing PCDH19 variant should develop PCDH19-related epilepsy. Here , we report such evidence:- a male child with KS and PCDH19-related epilepsy- supporting the PCDH19 cellular interference disease hypothesis.
