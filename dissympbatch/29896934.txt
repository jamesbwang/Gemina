  Hip denervation comprising radiofrequency lesioning of the obturator and femoral articular branches is used in adults with refractory hip<symptom> pain<symptom> who are not surgical candidates. Persistent hip<symptom> pain<symptom> occurs infrequently in pediatric patients , and there are limited data on the safety and efficacy of this procedure in a pediatric population. We provide a case report of a successful ultrasound and fluoroscopic-guided hip denervation procedure in an 11-year-old girl with persistent right hip<symptom> pain<symptom> after septic<disease> arthritis<disease> refractory to conservative and surgical management. At an 18-week follow-up , hip denervation provided improvement in pain , mobility , and reduced opioid consumption by 20 %.
