  To assess the association , if any , between brivaracetam ( BRV)- induced elevated carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide ( CBZ-E) and toxicity and efficacy in patients with epilepsy. Data were pooled from three double-blind , placebo-controlled , Phase III studies of adjunctive BRV in adults with uncontrolled focal seizures<symptom> ( N01252/NCT00490035 , N01253/NCT00464269 , N01358/NCT01261325). Treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) of interest ( ataxia<symptom> , diplopia<symptom> , dizziness<symptom> , nystagmus<symptom> , somnolence , accidental overdose or poisoning<disease> , and toxicity) , discontinuations due to TEAEs , and serious TEAEs ( SAEs) were assessed in subgroups who did/did not receive carbamazepine ( CBZ) at study entry ( CBZ + and CBZ-). Logistic regression analysis evaluated CBZ-E/CBZ plasma concentrations and TEAEs. SAEs suggestive of CBZ-E toxicity were summarized from the BRV safety database up to a cut-off of October 1 , 2014. Percent reduction in focal seizure<symptom> frequency over placebo was assessed in subgroups of CBZ-E/CBZ ratios. Data from 1558 patients were included in the pooled safety population. Of these , concomitant CBZ was received by 184/459 ( 40.1 %) placebo-treated and 315/803 ( 39.2 %) BRV-treated patients ( â‰¥ 50 mg/day). In BRV-treated patients , study completion rates were similar in the CBZ + ( 92.7 %) and CBZ- ( 88.7 %) groups; incidence of TEAEs of interest was similar ( CBZ + 24.4 %; CBZ- 24.2 %) , and did not appear affected by CBZ dosage; SAEs and discontinuations due to TEAEs were CBZ + 1.6 %; CBZ- 3.9 % and 2.9 %; 9.2 % , respectively. Likelihood of TEAEs of interest decreased with increasing CBZ-E/CBZ ratio for BRV-treated patients: odds ratio 0.88 ( 95 % confidence intervals 0.74 , 1.03; p = 0.112). In the safety database , five SAEs suggestive of CBZ-E toxicity were identified. Efficacy outcomes did not appear to have a consistent pattern across CBZ-E/CBZ ratio subgroups. This post-hoc analysis does not support an association between CBZ-E levels and TEAEs potentially associated with CBZ-E toxicity , or with increases in efficacy. Overall , current evidence does not suggest that BRV dose adjustment is required with concomitant CBZ.
