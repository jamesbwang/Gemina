  Progestin and adipoQ receptor 3 ( PAQR3) , is a Golgi-anchored membrane protein containing seven transmembrane helices. It has been demonstrated that PAQR3 mediates insulin resistance , glucose and lipid metabolism , and inflammation<symptom>. In addition , kidney inflammatory fibrosis<disease> is an important pathological feature of diabetic nephropathy ( DN). Therefore , we aimed to investigate the role of PAQR3 in diabetic kidney fibrosis<disease> as well as inflammation<symptom> in DN. The effect of PAQR3 on NF-κB signaling pathway , expressions of fibronectin ( FN) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1) in glomerular mesangial cells ( GMCs) cultured by high glucose ( HG) were examined. Diabetic mouse and rat models were induced by streptozotocin ( STZ). GMCs were treated with HG and transfected with PAQR3 plasmids or small-interfering RNA targeting PAQR3 or NF-κB. The protein levels of FN and ICAM-1 were examined by Western blotting , and the transcriptional activity and DNA binding activity of NF-κB were measured by dual luciferase reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA). The interaction between PAQR3 and IKKβ ( inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase β) was analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation. PAQR3 was increased in both STZ-induced diabetic models and HG-treated GMCs. PAQR3 overexpression further increased HG-induced FN and ICAM-1 upregulation. In contrast , silencing of PAQR3 suppressed the expressions of FN and ICAM-1. PAQR3 overexpression promoted the nuclear accumulation , DNA binding activity , and transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Mechanically , PAQR3 directly interacted with IKKβ. The upregulation effect of PAQR3 overexpression on the expressions of FN and ICAM-1 was abolished by the treatment of NF-κB siRNA or PDTC ( ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate) in HG-treated GMCs. PAQR3 promotes the expressions of FN and ICAM-1
