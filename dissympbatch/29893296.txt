  There is a general impression among dermatologists in India that terbinafine has been losing its effectiveness in dermatophytoses over the past few years , but there are no recent data to support this. To determine the effectiveness of terbinafine in tinea<disease> corporis<disease> , tinea<disease> cruris<disease> and tinea<disease> faciei with a pragmatic prospective cohort study. A sample size of 361 patients was calculated taking a 5 % margin of error and a 95 % confidence level. Five hundred patients with tinea<disease> corporis<disease> , tinea<disease> cruris<disease> and tinea<disease> faciei confirmed by potassium hydroxide microscopy received oral terbinafine ( 5mg/kg/day) and topical terbinafine 1 % applied twice daily for 4 weeks. Patients were evaluated at 2 and 4 weeks. Cure was defined as total clearance of lesions<symptom> and negative microscopy. Patients who came for follow-up at 2 and 4 weeks numbered 357 and 362 respectively. Ten patients were cured at 2 weeks ( cure rate 2 % , 95 % confidence interval 1.0-3.7 % , intention-to-treat analysis) and 153 patients were cured at 4 weeks ( cure rate 30.6 % , 95 % confidence interval 26.7-34.8 %). Culture and antifungal susceptibility testing were not performed since this was a pragmatic study. There was also no follow up after completion of treatment to check for relapses , but the poor<symptom> response<symptom> makes this less relevant. The effectiveness of terbinafine in dermatophytosis<disease> was abysmal in this study.
