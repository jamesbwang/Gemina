  We report a case of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma ( MPM) in a 31-year-old male with history of cerebral palsy , hydrocephalus<symptom> , and ventriculoperitoneal shunt ( VPS) placed since infancy. He presented with fever<disease> , abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and distension. Computed tomography scan revealed a thick-walled rim-enhancing fluid collection , interpreted as pseudocyst. Intraoperatively , diffuse nodular peritoneal thickening with adhesions was demonstrated. The resection specimen consisted of multiple membranous fragments displaying firm nodules<symptom>. Microscopic examination revealed a tumefactive malignant-appearing epithelioid proliferation involving the peritoneum , focally invading the underlying fat. Immunohistochemically , the tumor cells expressed keratin AE1/AE3 , CK7 , CK5/6 , Calretinin , WT1 and D2-40 , and were negative for CEA and MOC31. The findings were consistent with MPM , epithelioid type. The patient 's condition continued to decline with increasing abdominal distension during the month following the original diagnosis. While atypical mesothelial hyperplasia<disease> has been described in association with long standing VPS , well-documented cases of MPM have not been previously reported in such context.
