  We review the literature on co-occurrence of syncope and headache<symptom> and share clinical experience. Headache<symptom> in relation to syncope has been the subject of recent interest. Orthostatic intolerance has an expanding spectrum with three well-defined entities: orthostatic hypotension<symptom> ( OH) , neurally mediated hypotension<symptom> ( NMH) , and postural tachycardia<symptom> syndrome<disease> ( PoTS). Syncope occurs in patients with OH as well as in patients with episodically occurring NMH. Headache<symptom> of OH is called coat-hanger ache ( CHA) because it affects the neck and shoulders in a coat-hanger pattern. It can serve as a warning symptom of OH as well as a parameter to gauge the benefit of treatment. Awareness of CHA avoids inappropriate tests. Headache<symptom> type occurring in NMH has not been fully delineated. A questionnaire-based study describes migraine leading to syncope and treatment of migraine to reduce syncope. Laboratory studies in NMH patients provide evidence for only short-duration headache<symptom> The author 's approach to such patients is presented.
