  The risk of metabolic syndrome<disease> can be influenced by inadequate vitamin D levels , and exposure to sunlight is the main external source of vitamin D. The present study assessed the influence of environmental , biological , and nutritional factors in relation to seasonal 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD) concentration in individuals with metabolic syndrome<disease>. This cross-sectional study enrolled 180 individuals with metabolic syndrome<disease> aged between 18 and 80 years. The 25OHD concentration was considered the dependent variable; independent variables included age , sex , skin<symptom> color , use of sunscreen , skin type , sun exposure score , ultraviolet radiation index , geographic location , season , body mass index , waist: hip ratio , waist circumference , parathyroid hormone level , total serum calcium level , and calcium and vitamin D intake. The average vitamin D in individuals evaluated in summer 32 ± 10 ng/mL was greater than in the winter 26 ± 8 ng/mL ( p < 0.017). HDL-cholesterol was the only component of the MetS that differed significantly between the seasons ( p < 0.001) , showing higher concentrations in autumn 45 ± 8 mg/dL than in summer 35 ± 8 mg/dL. In the multiple regression model , gender , WHR , sun exposure score , and winter vs. summer explained 10 % of the variation in 25OHD concentration ( p = 0.004). Sex , waist: hip ratio , sun exposure , and summer season were predictors of 25OHD status among individuals with metabolic syndrome<disease>. HDL-cholesterol was the only component of metabolic syndrome<disease> that differed significantly between the seasons.
