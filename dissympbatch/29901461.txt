  To provide an overview of recent findings concerning refeeding syndrome<disease> ( RFS) among critically ill patients and recommendations for daily practice. Recent literature shows that RFS is common among critically ill ventilated patients. Usual risk factors for non-ICU patients addressed on ICU admission do not identify patients developing RFS. A marked drop of phosphate levels ( > 0.16 mmol/l) from normal levels within 72 h of commencement of feeding , selects patients that benefit from hypocaloric or restricted caloric intake for at least 48 h resulting in lower long-term mortality. RFS is a potentially life-threatening condition induced by initiation of feeding after a period of starvation. Although a uniform definition is lacking , most definitions comprise a complex constellation of laboratory markers ( i.e. hypophosphatemia , hypokalemia , hypomagnesemia) or clinical symptoms , including cardiac and pulmonary<symptom> failure<symptom>. Recent studies show that low caloric intake results in lower mortality rates in critically ill RFS patients compared with RFS patients on full nutritional support. Therefore , standard monitoring of RFS-markers ( especially serum phosphate) and caloric restriction when RFS is diagnosed should be considered. Furthermore , standard therapy with thiamin and electrolyte supplementation is essential.
