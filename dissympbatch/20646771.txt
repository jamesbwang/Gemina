  Over the past few decades , there has been a resurgence in the clinical use of honey as a topical wound<disease> treatment. A plethora of in vitro and in vivo evidence supports this resurgence , demonstrating that honey debrides wounds<disease> , kills bacteria , penetrates biofilm , lowers wound<disease> pH , reduces chronic inflammation<symptom> , and promotes fibroblast infiltration , among other beneficial qualities. Given these results , it is clear that honey has a potential role in the field of tissue engineering and regeneration. Researchers have incorporated honey into tissue engineering templates , including electrospun meshes , cryogels , and hydrogels , with varying degrees of success. This review details the current state of the field , including challenges which have yet to be overcome , and makes recommendations for the direction of future research in order to develop effective tissue regeneration therapies.
