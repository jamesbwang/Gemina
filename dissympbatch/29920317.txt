  Dermatoscopy is a non-invasive diagnostic tool currently used for neoplastic skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> , several inflammatory and infectious<disease> diseases<disease> , and skin appendage disorders. As the clinical applications of dermatoscopy beyond pigmented lesions<symptom> are constantly increasing , the aim of this paper is to provide an update on this topic. This comprehensive review substantiates how several diseases may show peculiar dermatoscopy features so to enhance the diagnosis and to avoid in selected cases unnecessary histological confirmation. In other cases , dermatoscopy features may be shared with other conditions with the advantage of narrowing down the differential diagnosis by ruling out those dermatoses with similar clinical aspect but different dermatoscopy presentation.
