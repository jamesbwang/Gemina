  Extravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia<disease> ( EPEH) is an extremely uncommon form of papillary endothelial hyperplasia<disease> characterized by an exuberant reactive endothelial proliferation in areas of extravascular hemorrhage<symptom> rather than within the vascular lumen. Intracranial EPEH is known to develop following radiosurgery in patients with intracranial neoplasms , suggesting a causative relationship between radiotherapy and the development of EPEH. Intracranial EPEH is typically treated with surgical resection , and to date , there have been no reported cases of EPEH recurrence following gross total resection. A 75-year-old male with a history of atypical meningioma presented to our hospital with progressive right upper and lower extremity weakness<symptom>. Eight and a half years prior to admission , the patient underwent surgical resection and stereotactic radiosurgery for a WHO grade II meningioma. Several years later , he developed a mass in the prior resection cavity and was subsequently treated with gross total resection and cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds. Postoperative pathology of the resected tissue at that time showed extravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia<disease> with no evidence of recurrent atypical meningioma. On this admission , MRI showed a recurrent mass in the area of prior resection , at which time the patient underwent a third craniotomy and gross total resection. Postoperative histopathology exhibited findings consistent with the diagnosis of recurrent extravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia<disease>. This case report is the first known recurrence of intracranial EPEH occurring following gross total resection and brachytherapy.
