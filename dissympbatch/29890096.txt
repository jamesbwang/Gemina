  Acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> neither suspected nor diagnosed could develop a perforation or otherwise it would take to removing of a normal appendix. Utilization of a clinical score system for aided diagnosis of this pathology and can reduce a negative appendicitis<disease> National Clinicas Hospital. CÃ³rdoba. Argentina. Prospective and protocolized study. 594 patients were studied between October 2002 and December 2013. 312 males and 282 females their age average was 26.2 years. Alvarado score was realized in all patients when they entered. According clinic and second valoration with the score surgical exploration was decided in 574 patients. The remaining 20 were excluded due to other pathology. The diagnosis in acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> was confirmed by surgical finding and histopathologic studies. In surgical finding we showed 594 patients ( 91,28 %) had acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease>. There was no operative mortality. Respects morbidity there was 1,74 % of medical and 13,93 % of surgical complications. The anatomo-pathologic report showed a normal cecal appendix in 50. The incidence of negative appendicectomy was about 8.71 %. The utilization of score related to the surgical and anatomo-pathologic finding confirmed it was appreciable from 6 points to acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease> diagnosis.
