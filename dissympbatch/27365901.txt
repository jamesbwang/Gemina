  Endoscopic balloon dilation ( EBD) is an established therapy for esophageal stenosis. To assess its usefulness in children , we reviewed 11 years of pediatric cases of EBD in our hospital. Over the last 11 years , EBD was performed on 14 pediatric patients ( 10 boys and four girls; 7 months-11 years) at our hospital. All EBD sessions were performed under general anesthesia and fluoroscopic monitoring. The sessions were repeated every week or alternate weeks until resolution of dysphagia<symptom> or development of smooth endoscope passage. Stenosis was resolved in 14 of 14 patients ( 100 %). None of the patients ( 0 %) showed recurrence of stenosis. As for postoperative complications , mediastinitis<disease> occurred only in one patient ( 7.1 %). The median number of session repeats for an individual patient was three ( range 1-10). EBD is a safe and effective therapeutic modality for esophageal stenosis in children.
