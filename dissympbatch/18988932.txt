  Silicone injections , although well known for their adverse effect , are still widely used around the world. Pneumonitis<disease> after an injection of silicone liquid has been reported in several patients. Silicone liquid injection is frequently administered to transgender individuals into the buttocks area but is rarely used for the breasts<disease>. We report a case of presumed pneumonitis<disease> following breast silicone liquid injection. A 36-year-old woman was admitted due to shortness of breath three days after silicone liquid injection. Chest X-rays ( CXR) showed bilateral alveolar patchy infiltrates. Chest computed tomography scan revealed diffuse infiltrates involving mostly peripheral lung fields ( suggestive for silicone liquid injection) and multiple isodense soft-tissue nodules<symptom> in both breasts<disease>. The treatment included antibiotic and steroid administration. After being treated for a week , clinical results and the latest CXR revealed improvement compared with the previous CXR , and the patient was discharged in good condition.
