  Purpose The purpose of this article is to assess the diagnostic performance of arterial spin-labeling ( ASL) magnetic resonance perfusion imaging to differentiate neoplastic from non-neoplastic brain lesions<symptom>. Material and methods This prospective study included 60 consecutive , newly diagnosed , untreated patients with intra-axial lesions<symptom> with perilesional edema<symptom> ( PE) who underwent clinical magnetic resonance imaging including ASL sequences at 3T. Region of interest analysis was performed to obtain mean cerebral blood flow ( CBF) values from lesion<symptom> ( L) , PE and normal contralateral white matter ( CWM). Normalized ( n) CBF ratio was obtained by dividing the mean CBF value of L and PE by mean CBF value of CWM. Discriminant analyses were performed to determine the best cutoff value of nCBFL and nCBFPE in differentiating neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions<symptom>. Results Thirty patients were in the neoplastic group ( 15 high-grade gliomas ( HGGs) , 15 metastases) and 30 in the non-neoplastic group ( 12 tuberculomas , 10 neurocysticercosis , four abscesses<disease> , two fungal granulomas<disease> and two tumefactive demyelination) based on final histopathology and clincoradiological diagnosis. We found higher nCBFL ( 6.65 ± 4.07 vs 1.68 ± 0.80 , p < 0.001) and nCBFPE ( 1.86 ± 1.43 vs 0.74 ± 0.21 , p < 0.001) values in the neoplastic group than non-neoplastic. For predicting neoplastic lesions<symptom> , we found an nCBFL cutoff value of 1.89 ( AUC 0.917; 95 % CI 0.854 to 0.980; sensitivity 90 %; specificity 73 %) and nCBFPE value of 0.76 ( AUC 0.783; 95 % CI 0.675 to 0.891; sensitivity 80 %; specificity 58 %). Mean nCBFL was higher in HGGs ( 8.70 ± 4.16) compared to tuberculomas ( 1.98 ± 0.87); and nCBFPE was higher in HGGs ( 3.06 ± 1.53) compared to metastases ( 0.86 ± 0.34) and tuberculomas ( 0.73 ± 0.22) ( p < 0.001). Conclusion ASL perfusion may help in distinguishing neoplastic from non-neoplastic brain
