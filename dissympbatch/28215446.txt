  Cellulitis<disease> is a common skin and soft<disease> tissue<disease> infection<disease> with substantial misdiagnosis rates due to its nonspecific clinical characteristics. In this report , we present a patient with recurrent metastatic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL) masquerading as a unilateral lower extremity cellulitis<disease> A 62-year-old man with a history of DLBCL , in remission for two years , presented with a two-week history of swelling and erythema of the right thigh and leg. Despite treatment with clindamycin and cephalexin , the redness and swelling continued to progress. On presentation to the emergency department , vitals were within normal limits , laboratory workup was significant only for borderline anemia<symptom> and thrombocytopenia<symptom> , and bilateral lower extremity ultrasound was negative for a clot. The patient was evaluated by a dermatologist who recommended further imaging workup for proximal vascular compression given the uniformity of inflammation<symptom> and edema<symptom> in the absence of fever<disease> or systemic symptoms. Imaging revealed retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy<disease> , right pelvic side wall and right inguinal lymphadenopathy<disease> , an intramuscular lymphomatous involvement of the right iliopsoas muscle , and mass compression of the right external iliac vein. Bone<disease> marrow and soft-tissue biopsies confirmed recurrent and metastatic DLBCL. In this patient , the atypical cellulitis-like features are likely due to venous and lymphatic obstruction secondary to mass effect from metastasis. Going forward , clinicians should consider compression-induced edema<symptom> as a sign of primary or recurrent malignancy in patients with refractory or atypical
