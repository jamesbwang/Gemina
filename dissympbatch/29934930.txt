  We aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of idiopathic retinal vasculitis , aneurysms<disease> , and neuroretinitis ( IRVAN) syndrome<disease>. Furthermore , we aimed to correlate the number and location of retinal aneurysms<disease> with the size of retinal non-perfusion area and neovascularization. Six patients with IRVAN syndrome<disease> ( 1 male and 5 females , age 5-38 years) were enrolled in this study. Fundus fluorescein angiography ( FFA) was used to determine the total number of retinal aneurysms<disease> , number of aneurysms<disease> within the first branch of the retinal artery , minimum distance between the non-perfusion margin and the optic disc , and the number of retinal aneurysms<disease> in each quadrant<symptom> , as well as the type of neovascularization. The size of the non-perfusion area was positively correlated with the total number of retinal aneurysms<disease> , the number of aneurysms<disease> within the first branch of the retinal artery , and the number of retinal aneurysms<disease> in each quadrant<symptom> ( P < 0.05). During the 5-year follow-up , one patient exhibited a dynamic change in the number and location of retinal aneurysms<disease>. In IRVAN syndrome<disease> , the number and location of retinal aneurysms<disease> correlate with the size of retinal non-perfusion area and type of neovascularization.
