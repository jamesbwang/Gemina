  Patients with major burn injury undergo a series of pathophysiologic changes that begin with a systemic inflammatory response and coagulation abnormalities , similar to those experienced by patients with sepsis<disease> or severe trauma. Coagulation changes in patients with burns are generally characterized by procoagulant abnormalities , but alterations in fibrinolysis and anticoagulation factors have also been observed. Around 40 % of patients with major burn show changes on standard coagulation tests , and these have been related to the severity of the lesions<symptom> , smoke inhalation , and administration of intensive fluid resuscitation therapy. Current surgical techniques for debridement of burn lesions<symptom> are aggressive and associated with considerable blood<symptom> loss<symptom>. A fast-acting selective enzymatic debriding agent based on bromelain has been recently developed. NexoBrid is indicated for removing eschar in adults with deep partial- and full-thickness thermal burns. A potential effect of oral bromelain on hemostasis has been described , but it is uncertain whether NexoBrid application has a clinically relevant impact in this regard. We present the clinical case of a patient with burns who showed a coagulation abnormality shortly after NexoBrid use.
