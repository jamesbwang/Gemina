  The prognosis for patients with refractory soft-tissue sarcoma<disease> ( STS) is dismal. Anlotinib has previously shown antitumor activity on STS in preclinical and phase I studies. Patients 18 years and older , progressing after anthracycline-based chemotherapy , na√Øve from angiogenesis inhibitors , with at least one measurable lesion<symptom> according to RECIST 1.1 , were enrolled. The main subtypes eligible were: undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma<disease> ( UPS) , liposarcoma ( LPS) , leiomyosarcoma ( LMS) , synovial sarcoma<disease> ( SS) , fibrosarcoma ( FS) , alveolar soft part sarcoma<disease> ( ASPS) and clear cell sarcoma<disease> ( CCS). Participants were treated with anlotinib. The primary endpoint was progression-free rate at 12 weeks ( PFR 12 weeks). 166 patients were included in the final analysis. Overall , the PFR 12 weeks was 68 % and objective response rate was 13 % ( 95 % CI 7.6 % -18 %). The median progression free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) were 5.6 and 12 months respectively. The PFR 12 weeks , median PFS and OS were: 58 % , 4.1 and 11 months for UPS ( n = 19); 63 % , 5.6 and 13 months for LPS ( n = 13); 75 % , 11 and 15 months for LMS ( n = 26); 75 % , 7.7 and 12 months for SS ( n = 47); 81 % , 5.6 and 12 months for FS ( n = 18); 77 % , 21 and not reached for ASPS ( n = 13); 54 % , 11 and 16 months for CCS ( n = 7); 44 % , 2.8 and 8.8 months for other sarcoma<disease> ( n = 23) , respectively. The most common clinically significant grade 3 or higher adverse events were hypertension ( 4.8 %) , triglyceride elevation ( 3.6 %) and pneumothorax ( 2.4 %). No treatment-related death occurred. Anlotinib showed antitumor activity in several STS entities. The toxicity was manageable.
