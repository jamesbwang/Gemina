  Recent evidence implicates adaptive immunity as a key player in the mechanisms supporting hepatic inflammation<symptom> during the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD). In these settings , patients with NAFLD often show an increase in the circulating levels of antibodies against oxidative stress-derived epitopes ( OSE). Nonetheless , the actual role of humoral immunity in NAFLD is still unclear. This study investigates the contribution of B-lymphocytes to NAFLD evolution. B-lymphocyte immunostaining of liver biopsies from NAFLD patients showed that B-cells were evident within cell aggregates rich in T-lymphocytes. In these subjects , B/T-lymphocyte infiltration positively correlated with both circulating IgG targeting oxidative stress-derived epitopes ( OSE) and interferon-γ ( IFN-γ) levels. Furthermore , high prevalence of lymphocyte<symptom> aggregates identified patients with more severe lobular inflammation<symptom> and fibrosis<disease>. In mouse models of NAFLD , the onset of steatohepatitis was characterized by hepatic B2-lymphocytes maturation to plasma cells and by an elevation in circulating anti-OSE IgG titers. B-cell responses preceded T-cell activation and were accompanied by the up-regulation in the hepatic expression of B-cell Activating Factor ( BAFF). Selective B2-cell depletion in mice over-expressing a soluble form of the BAFF/APRIL receptor Transmembrane Activator and Cyclophilin Ligand Interactor ( TACI-Ig) prevented plasma cell maturation and Th-1 activation of liver CD4
