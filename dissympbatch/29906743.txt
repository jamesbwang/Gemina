  Lipoteichoic acid ( LTA)- induced acute lung injury ( ALI) is an experimental model for mimicking Gram-positive bacteria-induced pneumonia<disease> that is a refractory disease with lack of effective medicines. Here , we reported that costunolide , a sesquiterpene lactone , ameliorated LTA-induced ALI. Costunolide treatment reduced LTA-induced neutrophil lung infiltration , cytokine and chemokine production ( TNF-Î± , IL-6 and KC) , and pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom>. In response to LTA challenge , treatment with costunolide resulted less iNOS expression and produced less inflammatory cytokines in bone<disease> marrow derived macrophages ( BMDMs). Pretreatment with costunolide also attenuated the LTA-induced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK in BMDMs. Furthermore , costunolide treatment reduced the phosphorylation of TAK1 and inhibited the interaction of TAK1 with Tab1. In conclusion , we have demonstrated that costunolide protects against LTA-induced ALI via inhibiting TAK1-mediated MAPK signaling pathway , and our studies suggest that costunolide is a promising agent for treatment of Gram-positive bacteria-mediated
