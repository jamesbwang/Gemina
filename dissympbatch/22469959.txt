  The pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis<disease> ( NEC) remains poorly understood but is thought to be multifactorial. There are no specific recurring chromosomal abnormalities previously associated with NEC. We report 3 cases of intestinal<symptom> necrosis<symptom> associated with large chromosome 6 deletions. The first patient was found to have a 7.9-Mb deletion of chromosome 6 encompassing over 40 genes , arr ( GRCh37) 6q25 .3 q26 ( 155699183_163554531) × 1. The second patient had a 19.5-Mb deletion of chromosome 6 generated by an unbalanced translocation with chromosome 18 , 46 , XY , der ( 6) t ( 6; 18) ( q25 .1; p11 .23) , arr ( GRCh37) 6q25 .1 q27 ( 151639526 _ 171115067) × 1 , 18p11 .32 p11 .23 ( 131700_7694199) × 3 , which included the whole 7.9-Mb region deleted in the first patient. The third patient was the younger sibling of the second patient with an identical derivative chromosome 6. The shared abnormal chromosome 6 region includes multiple genes of interest , particularly
