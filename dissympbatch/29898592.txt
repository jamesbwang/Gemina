  We tried to evaluate whether there is any specific features in treatment outcomes of first-line afatinib in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR)- mutant non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) , compared with gefitinib or erlotinib. We analyzed patients treated with first-line afatinib , gefitinib , or erlotinib for advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC at Samsung Medical Center between 2014 and 2016. In total , 467 patients received first-line afatinib ( n = 165) , gefitinib ( n = 230) , or erlotinib ( n = 72). Afatinib was used more often in patients with tumors harboring deletion in exon 19 ( Del19) , whereas the gefitinib group had more elderly , females , and never smokers. The median progression-free survival ( PFS) time for afatinib , gefitinib , and erlotinib was 19.1 months , 13.7 months , and 14.0 months , respectively ( p = 0.001). The superior PFS of afatinib was more remarkable in subgroups of Del19 or uncommon EGFR mutations. Overall toxicity profiles of the three drugs were comparable , though more grade 3 or 4 toxicities were detected in afatinib ( 7.3 %) compared with gefitinib ( 2.6 %) or erlotinib ( 1.8 %). The common grade 3 or 4 toxicities of afatinib included diarrhea<disease> ( 3.0 %) , paronychia<disease> ( 2.4 %) , and skin<symptom> rash<symptom> ( 1.8 %). Dose modification was more frequently required in patients treated with afatinib ( 112/165 , 68 %) , compared with gefitinib ( 5/230 , 2 %) and erlotinib ( 4/72 , 6 %). Interestingly , however , dose reduction in the afatinib group did not impair its efficacy in terms of PFS ( dose reduction vs. no reduction group , 23.5 vs. 12.4 months). First-line afatinib showed satisfactory efficacy data and manageable toxicity profiles.
