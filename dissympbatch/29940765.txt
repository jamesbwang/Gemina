  A single-center retrospective study the complication and mortality of surgical treatment of esophageal cancer 2006 to 2015 is presented. A total of 212 patients with esophageal cancer were operated at the First Department of Surgery University Hospital Olomouc , Czech Republic in the period between 2006 and 2015. Adenocarcinoma was histologically described in 127 patients ( 59.9 %) , squamous cell carcinoma in 82 patients ( 38.7 %) , and other types of carcinoma were described in 3 cases. According to the preoperative staging of esophageal cancer , the patients with early stage disease ( T1-2N0M0) had primary surgery , while the patients with advanced stage ( T3-4N0-2M0) were indicated for neoadjuvant chemoradiation with the surgery being performed subsequently. Transhiatal laparoscopic esophagectomy was performed in 183 patients , and Orringer esophagectomy in 4 patients. Thoracoscopic esophagectomy was performed in 17 patients and thoracotomy in 30 patients. Respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> with the development of ARDS syndrome<disease> accompanied by multiple-organ failure occurred in 21 patients. Statistically significant association between mortality and ASA ( p = 0.009) and between respiratory complications and ASA ( p = 0.006) was demonstrated. The majority of patients who died were under 60 years of age ( p = 0.039). Further , significant association between 30-day mortality and tumor stage ( p = 0.021) , gender ( p = 0.022) and age ( p = 0.018) was evident. A significant association between tumor stage and fistula<disease> in anastomosis , ( p = 0.043) was observed.Esophagectomy is a procedure , which should be performed in specialized high-volume centers experienced in treatment of this serious malignancy and by certified oncology surgeons with long time experience in esophageal surgery.
