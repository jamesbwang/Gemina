  Nesfatin-1 , a satiety molecule processed from nucleobindin2 ( NUCB2) , is implicated in visceral hypersensitivity<disease> in rats and colocalized with 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT) in the dorsal raphe nucleus ( DRN). Maternal separation ( MS) in rats contributes to visceral hypersensitivity<disease> via elevated expression of 5-HT in the DRN. Intracerebroventricular injection of nesfatin-1 activates DRN 5-HT neurons. In this study , A model of visceral hypersensitivity<disease> was developed by subjecting rats to MS. Colorectal distension was used to detect visceral sensitivity , which was evaluated by abdominal<symptom> withdrawal<symptom> reflex ( AWR) scores and electromyogram ( EMG) magnitude. MS rats exhibited higher AWR scores and EMG magnitude compared with controls. The numbers of nesfatin-1- and tryptophan hydroxylase ( TPH , the rate-limiting enzyme for 5-HT synthesis)- positive cells in the DRN were significantly elevated accordingly. Visceral hypersensitivity<disease> was significantly alleviated in MS rats treated with intra-DRN administration of anti-nesfatin-1/ NUCB2 , accompanied by decreased expression of 5-HT and TPH in the DRN , compared with the vehicle-treated group. In contrast , intra-DRN administration of nesfatin-1 into normal adult rats induced visceral hypersensitivity<disease> , which correlated with elevated expression of 5-HT and TPH in the DRN. In conclusion , Nesfatin-1 has critical effects on visceral hypersensitivity<disease>; the underlying mechanisms might be related to the activation of DRN 5-HT neurons.
