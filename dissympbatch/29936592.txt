  Poor<symptom> sleep quality is prevalent and is associated with cognitive decline , impaired health , and reduced quality of life. There is a lack of studies about sleep quality and its potential risk factors among rural adults aged 45 years or above under rapid urbanization in China. In a cross-sectional survey conducted in Deqing County , China in 2015 , we included 1584 adults 45 + years of age. Sleep quality was measured by using the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( CPSQI). Poor<symptom> sleep quality was defined by a CPSQI global score > 5. Other data collected included sociodemographic and lifestyle factors as well as physical health. Logistic regression model was applied to assess factors influencing sleep quality by calculating crude odds ratio ( cOR) , adjusted OR ( aOR) , and their 95 % confident intervals ( CI). Of 1584 subjects , more than half were female with an average age of 58.9 ± 8.1 years. Their night sleep duration was 7.7 ± 1.2 h , sleep latency was 31.9 ± 32.0 min , and 17 % of them could not fall asleep within half hour , averagely. The mean score of CPSQI was 4.4 ± 2.7. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 27.7 % ( 95 % CI = 25.4-29.7 %) overall , and there existed a significant sex difference-30.6 % ( 95 % CI = 27.7-33.7 %) for women and 24.0 % ( 95 % CI = 20.9-27.2 %) for men. Five domains of the CPSQI except for sleep efficiency and use of sleeping medication also showed a sex difference ( p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis indicated that unmarried status ( aOR = 1.51 , 95 % CI = 1.03-2.22) , lower monthly individual income ( aOR = 2.09 , 95 % CI = 1.49-2.94) , and chronic<disease> diseases<disease> ( aOR = 1.95 , 95 % CI = 1.51-2.51) were significantly related to poor sleep quality. Sleep problems were prevalent among the rural Chinese adults aged 45 + years. People who were unmarried or had low personal income or any chronic<disease> diseases<disease> were more likely to have poor sleep quality.
