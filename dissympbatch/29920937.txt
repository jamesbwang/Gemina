  Host responses toward foreign implants that lead to chronic inflammation<symptom> and fibrosis<disease> may result in failure of the biomedical device. To solve these problems , first a better understanding of the biomaterial-induced host reactions including protein adsorption , leukocyte activation , inflammatory and fibrotic responses to biomaterials is required; second an improved design of biomaterial surfaces is needed that results in an appropriate host response , causing less inflammatory response , and supporting tissue regeneration. Hence , this review provides a brief overview on the host response to implants , as well as in vitro models to study inflammatory and fibrotic responses to biomaterials to predict the clinical outcome of implantation. Moreover , the review highlights anti-inflammatory strategies to improve the biocompatibility of implants , which contain the modification of physicochemical surface properties of materials as well as the immobilization of anti-inflammatory reagents and bioactive molecules on biomaterials.
