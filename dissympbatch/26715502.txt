  Commensal microbiota are immunomodulatory , and their pathological perturbation can affect the risk and outcomes of infectious and inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>. Consequently , the human microbiota is an emerging diagnostic and therapeutic target in critical illness. In this study , we compared four sample types-rectal , naris , and antecubital swabs and stool<symptom> samples-for 16S rRNA gene microbiota sequencing in intensive care unit ( ICU) patients. Stool<symptom> samples were obtained in only 31 % of daily attempts , while swabs were reliably obtained ( â‰¥ 97 % of attempts). Swabs were compositionally distinct by anatomical site , and rectal swabs identified within-patient temporal trends in microbiota composition. Rectal swabs from ICU patients demonstrated differences from healthy stool<symptom> similar to those observed in comparing stool<symptom> samples from ICU patients to those from the same healthy controls. Rectal swabs are a useful complement to other sample types for analysis of the intestinal microbiota in critical illness , particularly when obtaining stool<symptom> may not be feasible or practical.
