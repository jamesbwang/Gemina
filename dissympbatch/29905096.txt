  Horner syndrome<disease> was identified in 25 of 30777 avian admissions to Currumbin Wildlife Hospital during 2010-2016. Unilateral ptosis<symptom> and erection of facial feathers were distinct findings on physical examination and consistent across 9 species. Affected birds were biased toward adults ( 64 %) suffering traumatic injuries ( 88 %). Concurrent injuries requiring treatment were present in 38 % of cases , and 76 % had additional neurologic deficits. Prognosis for release was poor , with an overall success rate of 32 %. Resolution of clinical signs increased to 44 % with higher doses of meloxicam and required an average hospitalization of 22 days ( range , 3-78 days). Further investigation of the underlying causes of Horner syndrome<disease> in birds to provide treatment and prognostic guidelines is warranted.
