  Macrophages are highly plastic cells that can either mediate or suppress inflammation<symptom> , depending on their cellular phenotype and cytokine secretion. Inducing macrophages from an inflammatory ( 'M 1 ') to anti-inflammatory ( 'M 2 ') phenotype has significant implications for the treatment of inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> and regeneration of injured tissues. Although certain cytokines , such as interleukin-4 and -13 , are known to induce this phenotypic switch , their therapeutic use in vivo has both safety and efficacy concerns. Here , we demonstrate an alternative approach to change macrophage phenotype from M1 to M2 , through inducing the clustering of mannose receptors ( MR) on the cell surface , by using carbohydrate-presenting substrates. We prepared and screened glucomannan-decorated silicon oxide of different sizes ranging from 10 to 1000 nm , and identified one type ( KSiNP30) that could potently induce MR clustering on macrophages and thereby stimulated the cells into an M2 phenotype- as an unexpected consequence of MR activation. Further administration of KSiNP30 in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease efficiently alleviated the colitis<disease> symptoms , indicating the translational potential of our finding for therapeutic applications. In summary , we report for the first time an approach to modulate cellular immune responses by manipulating the assembly of cell-surface receptors , without the aid of cytokines. Our approach may provide insights for the development of new anti-inflammatory therapies.
