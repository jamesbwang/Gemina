  CLOVES syndrome<disease> ( congenital lipomatous overgrowth , vascular malformations , epidermal naevi , scoliosis/skeletal and spinal<disease> syndrome<disease>) is a genetic disorder that results from somatic , mosaic gain-of-function mutations of the PIK3CA gene , and belongs to the spectrum of PIK3CA-related overgrowth syndromes<disease> ( PROS). This rare condition has no specific treatment and a poor survival rate. Here , we describe a postnatal mouse model of PROS/CLOVES that partially recapitulates the human<disease> disease<disease> , and demonstrate the efficacy of BYL719 , an inhibitor of PIK3CA , in preventing and improving organ dysfunction. On the basis of these results , we used BYL719 to treat nineteen patients with PROS. The drug improved the disease symptoms in all patients. Previously intractable vascular tumours became smaller , congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> was improved , hemihypertrophy was reduced , and scoliosis was attenuated. The treatment was not associated with any substantial side effects. In conclusion , this study provides the first direct evidence supporting PIK3CA inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy in patients with PROS.
