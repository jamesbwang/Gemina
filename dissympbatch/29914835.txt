  For patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis , the durability of vascular access ( VA) is still far from optimal , and access survival after intervention for access failure is an important aspect. Procoagulant status is a leading cause of access failure. Coagulation-fibrinolysis imbalance can occur in hemodialyzed patients , but the influence of the imbalance has not been fully elucidated. We prospectively examined coagulation-fibrinolysis balance<symptom> to assess the risk of access failure after the intervention of revascularization in a cohort of 462 hemodialysis patients. Thrombin-antithrombin complex ( TAT) and plasmin-Î± The 162 patients who reached an end point had smaller access flow volume and smaller percentage of arteriovenous fistula<disease> and higher TAT/PIC ratio. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the patients with elevated TAT/PIC ratio showed poorer outcome ( P < .001). On Cox regression modeling , elevated TAT/PIC was an independent risk factor for access failure ( hazard ratio , 1.58; P = .03). Our results suggest that coagulation-fibrinolysis imbalance is a significant risk factor for access failure and may predict VA failure in hemodialyzed patients after access intervention.
