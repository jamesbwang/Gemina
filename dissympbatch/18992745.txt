  Intestinal graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD) is a life-threatening , inflammatory donor T cell-mediated complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT). In the light of the reported efficacy of interleukin-23 ( IL-23)- blockade to mitigate syngeneic intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> in inflammatory bowel disease patients , targeting IL-23 and thereby interleukin-17a ( IL-17a) producing T helper ( Th17) cells as the T cell subset assumed to be mostly regulated by IL-23 , has emerged as a putatively general concept to harness immune-mediated mucosal inflammation<symptom> irrespective of the underlying trigger. However , the role of Th17 cells during allo-response driven colitis<disease> remains ambiguous due to a series of studies with inconclusive results. Interestingly , we recently identified granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF
