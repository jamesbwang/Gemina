  Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP4) inhibitors are known to have a protective effect on diabetic kidney disease , possibly via reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom> in the kidney. However , whether these potential mechanisms play a role in non-diabetic proteinuric kidney diseases is not clear. Two different animal experiments were carried out using sitagliptin and linagliptin for DPP4 inhibition. In each experiment , male Sprague-Dawley rats were uninephrectomized and randomly divided into vehicle-treated and doxorubicin-treated rats , with or without DPP4 inhibition. Administration of a DPP4 inhibitor was performed daily by oral gavage over six weeks. A single intravenous injection of doxorubicin resulted in hypertension and remarkable proteinuria<symptom>. Linagliptin , but not sitagliptin , lowered systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in rats with doxorubicin nephropathy. By contrast , sitagliptin ameliorated tubulointerstitial injury , inflammatory cell infiltration , and interstitial fibrosis<disease> in rat kidneys with doxorubicin nephropathy. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that mRNA expression of NLRP3 , caspase-1 , ASC , and IL-1Î² was remarkably increased in rat kidneys with doxorubicin nephropathy , and that this upregulation of the major components of the NLRP3 inflammasome was effectively suppressed by treatment with either sitagliptin or linagliptin. Additionally , upregulation of IL-6 was reversed by linagliptin , but not by sitagliptin. On the other hand , sitagliptin , but not linagliptin , reversed the increase in mRNA expression of gp91phox , p47phox , and p67phox in rat kidneys with doxorubicin nephropathy. NLRP3 inflammasome activation was shown in our rat model of doxorubicin nephropathy. DPP4 inhibitors can suppress the activity of NLRP3 , with or without relieving NADPH oxidase 2-related oxidative stress.
