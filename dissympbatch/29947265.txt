  To determine whether breast MRI-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy ( MRI-VAB) high-risk lesion<symptom> histology influences surgical or long-term imaging follow-up outcomes. Patients with imaging-concordant high-risk findings on 9-gauge breast MRI-VAB between January 2007 and July 2012 who had surgical histopathology or 2 year imaging follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. 90 patients with 99 lesions<symptom> were included. Lesions<symptom> were atypical ductal hyperplasia<disease> ( ADH) ( n = 21) , lobular neoplasia ( n = 36; atypical lobular hyperplasia<disease> ( ALH) ( n = 22) , lobular carcinoma in situ ( LCIS) ( n = 6) , and ALH plus LCIS ( n = 8)) , and other high-risk lesion<symptom> ( n = 42; papillary lesions<symptom> , radial scar , flat epithelial atypia , atypia unspecified). Of 53 excised lesions<symptom> , 6 ( 11 %) were upgraded to invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS). 4 of 21 ( 19 %) ADH lesions<symptom> were upgraded to DCIS. 2 of 36 ( 6 %) lobular neoplasia lesions<symptom> , both combined ALH and LCIS , were upgraded to DCIS , and invasive lobular carcinoma , respectively. The remaining 46 lesions<symptom> were managed conservatively with imaging follow-up: 17 ( 37 %) had mammography only , while 29 ( 63 %) had mammography and MRI follow-up. There was no evidence of breast cancer development at the site of MRI-VAB in the cases with only imaging follow-up. We conclude that the upgrade rate for high-risk lesions<symptom> at MRI-VAB at surgical excision is low. Surgical excision is warranted for ADH and combined ALH-LCIS lesions<symptom>. For other lesions<symptom> , a multidisciplinary approach to decide on personalized management may be appropriate. Advances in knowledge: Surgical excision is warranted for ADH lesions<symptom> and combined ALH-LCIS lesions<symptom> identified at breast MRI-VAB. A multidisciplinary approach to patient management of other high-risk lesions<symptom> may be appropriate.
