  Universal malaria<disease> diagnostic testing of all fever<disease> cases is the first step in correct malaria<disease> case management. However , monitoring adherence to universal testing is complicated by unreliable recording and reporting of the true number of fever<disease> cases. We searched the literature to obtain gold-standard estimates for the proportion of patients attending outpatient clinics in sub-Saharan Africa with malarial and non-malarial febrile illness. To correct for differences in malaria<disease> transmission , we calculated the proportion of patients with fever<disease> after excluding confirmed malaria<disease> cases. Next , we analyzed routine data from Guinea and Senegal to calculate the proportion of outpatients tested after exclusion of confirmed malaria<disease> cases from the numerator and denominator. From 12 health facility surveys in sub-Saharan Africa with gold-standard fever<disease> screening , the median proportion of febrile illness among outpatients after exclusion of confirmed malaria<disease> fevers<symptom> was 57 % ( range: 46-80 %). Analysis of routine data after exclusion of confirmed malaria<disease> cases demonstrated much lower testing proportions of 23 % ( Guinea) and 13 % ( Senegal). There was substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity in this testing proportion , and testing in Senegal was correlated with malaria<disease> season. Given the evidence from gold-standard surveys that at least 50 % of non-malaria consultations in sub-Saharan Africa are for febrile illness , it appears that a substantial proportion of patients with fever<disease> are not tested for malaria<disease> in health facilities when considering routine data. Tracking the proportion of patients tested for malaria<disease> after exclusion of the confirmed malaria<disease> cases could allow programs to make inferences about malaria<disease> testing practices using routine data.
