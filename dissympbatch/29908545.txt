  Recently , Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) have been described as regulatory factors for several biological mechanisms through regulating the gene expression. Among them the TNF and HNRNPL related immunoregulatory ( THRIL) lncRNA may be involved in the pathogenesis of immune-related and inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> through controlling the expression of the tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha ( TNF-α) expression. In this case-control study , we investigate the THRIL expression in blood 25 samples of de novo acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) cases ( 10 females and 15 males , mean age ± SD: 35.1 ± 3.2 years) in comparison to 50 healthy age and sex matched controls ( 21 females and 29 males , mean age ± SD: 34.9 ± 3.1) using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR ( qRT-PCR) in order to explore any association between THRIL and AML. Our results revealed that there was no significant difference in the expression level of THRIL lncRNA between AML patients and healthy individuals ( p = 0.2 , 95 % CI = -0.129-28.35). In addition , there was no significant association between male subgroup and THRIL expression as well as females ( p = 0.08 , 95 % CI = -0.197-19.251 , p = 0.4 , 95 % CI = -0.185-12.041 , respectively). In comparison between control group and FAB classification subtypes of AML patients , there was not any significant association. In conclusion , our study showed that THRIL can not be used as an informative biomarker for AML diagnosis , however , our results need to be clarify by evolution of more cases.
