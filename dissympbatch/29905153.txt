  Proximal duplication of chromosome 14q , including the FOXG1 gene located on 14q12 , is a rare condition characterised by developmental delay , dysmorphic craniofacial features , epilepsy , and severe<symptom> speech<symptom> delay. Here , we report a patient with West<disease> syndrome<disease> whose chromosome analysis revealed 14q11.2-21.1 duplication. The patient was admitted due to infantile epileptic spasms at eight months of age , motor developmental delay , and dysmorphic features. Chromosome and array-CGH analysis revealed de novo 14q11.2-21.1 duplication , spanning âˆ¼ 20 Mb ( minimal interval chr14: 20203610_40396835). The patient was followed up to 13 years of age , and at the last examination was shown to have severe<symptom> speech<symptom> delay , seizures<symptom> , and continuous spike-and-wave activity on EEG. The possibility of this chromosomal abnormality should be kept in mind in patients with developmental delay , epilepsy , and hypsarrtyhmia , in the absence of any structural brain lesion<symptom> or metabolic aetiology.
