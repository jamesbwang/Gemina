  Approximately 500 cases of idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome<disease> ( Clarkson syndrome<disease>) have been reported worldwide. This life-threatening condition is characterized by episodes of increase in vascular permeability with loss of fluid into the interstitium and presents with acute onset of edema<symptom> , signs of tissue hypoperfusion , hemoconcentration , and low blood protein level. It has been diagnosed mainly in middle-aged adults with a monoclonal gammopathy. We performed a systematic review of the literature on Clarkson syndrome<disease> in subjects ≤ 18 years of age. We identified 24 reports , published since 1989 , providing data on 32 otherwise healthy subjects , who experienced 67 well-documented episodes of Clarkson syndrome<disease>. The condition affected more frequently girls ( 21 , 66 %) than boys , presented throughout childhood , and was preceded by a mostly viral illness in 75 % of cases. A monoclonal gammopathy was never reported. Uncompensated circulatory shock<symptom> , muscle compartment syndrome<disease> , acute kidney injury , pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> , and either pleural or pericardial<symptom> effusion<symptom> were , in decreasing order of frequency , the most common complications. Four patients died. Clarkson syndrome<disease> develops not only in adulthood but also in childhood. In this age group , this condition is not linked to a monoclonal gammopathy. What is Known: • Clarkson syndrome<disease> is a rare condition that has been diagnosed mainly in middle-aged adults and is mostly linked to a monoclonal gammopathy. What is New: • In subjects ≤ 18 years of age , Clarkson syndrome<disease> is not linked to a monoclonal gammopathy.
