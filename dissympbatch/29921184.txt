  The Multimorbid Patient: Use of New Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease Abstract. Increasing life expectancy in Western countries is associated with a high prevalence of multiple chronic<disease> diseases<disease> which is defined by the term `` multimorbidity ''. Many of these patients suffer from chronic kidney disease ( CKD) and thrombogenic comorbidities such as atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> with the need for oral anticoagulation. For decades vitamin K antagonists have been exclusively prescribed for oral anticoagulation. However , due to altered pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of these drugs in CKD , a significant risk of bleeding exists. The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants as a new and promising alternative to vitamin K antagonists was- especially for CKD patients- highly anticipated. However , data from randomized studies are missing for older patients with advanced CKD. Consequently , a careful evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio is recommended for this sensitive patient population.
