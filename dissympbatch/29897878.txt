  Niemann-Pick type C disease ( NPC) is a rare human<disease> disease<disease> , with limited effective treatment options. Most cases of NPC disease are associated with inactivating mutations of the NPC1 gene. However , cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the NPC1 pathogenesis remain poorly defined. This is partly due to the lack of a suitable animal model to monitor the disease progression. In this study , we used CRISPR to construct an NPC1-/- zebrafish model , which faithfully reproduced the cardinal pathological features of this disease. In contrast to the wild type ( WT) , the deletion of NPC1 alone caused significant hepatosplenomegaly , ataxia<symptom> , Purkinje cell death , increased lipid storage , infertility<symptom> and reduced body length and life span. Most of the NPC1-/- zebrafish died within the first month post fertilization , while the remaining specimens developed slower than the WT and died before reaching 8 months of age. Filipin-stained hepatocytes of the NPC1-/- zebrafish were clear , indicating abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol. Lipid profiling showed a significant difference between NPC1-/- and WT zebrafish. An obvious accumulation of seven sphingolipids was detected in livers of NPC1-/- zebrafish. In summary , our results provide a valuable model system that could identify promising therapeutic targets and treatments for the NPC disease.
