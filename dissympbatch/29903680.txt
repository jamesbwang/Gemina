  Non-infective endocarditis<disease> , also referred to as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis<disease> , represent a wide range of rare pathologies , often severe. This review gathered the data available in the literature , to decipher the major information collected on the pathophysiology , the diagnosis and the treatment of these heterogeneous diseases , often misdiagnosed. Characteristics of non-infective endocarditis<disease> are similar to infective endocarditis<disease> in terms of valvular lesions<symptom> ( mostly left-sided , with regurgitations and vegetations) , and their complications ( embolism). The diagnosis of non-infective endocarditis<disease> is usually considered in patients with blood culture-negative endocarditis<disease> Beyond the usual suspects- marastic endocarditis<disease> and systemic lupus erythematosus- which represent more than 75 % of the cases , Beh√ßet disease and hypereosinophilic syndrome<disease> are the main causes of non-infective endocarditis<disease> More seldomly , rheumatoid arthritis<disease> , adult-onset Still disease , allergy to pork in patients with valvular procine bioprosthesis , systemic scleroderma , Cogan or Sneddon syndrome<disease> should be suspected. Diagnostic approach is based on history and physical examination , with a special focus on extra-cardiac manifestations , as well as echocardiography , and computed tomography. Treatment relies on intensive management of the underlying disease. Curative anticoagulation is often necessary. Although indications for cardiac surgery are poorly defined , as compared to infective endocarditis<disease> , data currently available suggest that an optimal control of the underlying disease before cardiac surgery is of utmost importance , as it dramatically reduces the risk of postoperative complications.
