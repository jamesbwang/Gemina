  Low back pain ( LBP) is considered as one of the most frequent health problems which is responsible for forming a huge worldwide burden. This study was conducted with the aim to determine the frequency of axial-Spondyloarthropathy ( axSpA) in patients presenting with chronic backache<symptom> using Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society ( ASAS) Criteria for axSpA. A total of 231 participants of either gender were enrolled with complaint of backache<symptom> of more than or equal to 3 months duration and younger than 45 years. In the first stage , patients were interviewed and examined using standard questionnaire. In the second stage after going through laboratory investigations and imaging patients were classified into either axSpA ( those meeting ASAS Criteria for axSpA) or non-SpA. There were 65 males and 166 females. Mean age was 36.26 years. Eighty-nine ( 39 %) patients were found to have axSpA as per ASAS Criteria. Majority of patients 70 ( 78.6 %) in the imaging arm of ASAS Criteria were picked via MRI of sacroiliac joints. Peripheral arthritis<disease> was seen in 57 ( 64 %) and Enthesitis in 52 ( 58.4 %). MRI performed exceptionally to reveal sacroiliitis highlighting the importance of this imaging modality in axSpA , which we recommend to be included in diagnostic algorithm in evaluating patients with chronic backache<symptom> under 45 years age.
