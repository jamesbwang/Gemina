  Background and aims In functional chest<symptom> pain<symptom> ( FCP) of presumed esophageal origin central nervous system hyperexcitability is generally believed to play an important role in pain pathogenesis. However , this theory has recently been challenged. Using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging , the aim was to characterize any microstructural reorganization of the pain neuromatrix in FCP patients. Methods 13 FCP patients and 20 matched healthy controls were studied in a 3T MR scanner. Inclusion criteria were relevant chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , normal coronary angiogram and normal upper gastrointestinal evaluation. Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) ( i.e. mean diffusivity of water) and fractional anisotropy ( FA) ( i.e. directionality of water diffusion as a measure of fiber organization) values were assessed in the secondary sensory cortex , cingulate cortex , insula , prefrontal cortex , and amygdala. Results Overall , including all regions , no difference in ADC and FA values was found between the patients and controls ( P = 0.79 and P = 0.23 , respectively). Post-hoc tests revealed no difference in ADC and FA values of the individual regions. However , a trend of patients having increased ADC in the mid insula grey matter and increased FA in the mid insula white matter was observed ( both P = 0.065). Conclusions This explorative study suggests that microstructural reorganization of the central pain neuromatrix may not be present in well-characterized FCP patients. Implications This finding , together with recent neurophysiologal evidence , challenges the theory of visceral hypersensitivity<disease> due to changes in the central nervous system in FCP patients.
