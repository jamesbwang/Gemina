  Spondylodiscitis , or vertebral osteomyelitis<disease> , is an unusual infection of the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs that can occasionally present with neurological signs. We present a patient with subacute flaccid paraparesis<disease> with associated albuminocytologic dissociation who was eventually diagnosed with spondylodiscitis. The case presented depicts a diagnostic difficulty encountered in clinical practice: Albuminocytologic dissociation in CSF is not always attributed to Guillain-Barre syndrome<disease> and other possible causes such as obstructive spinal cord lesions<symptom> must always be considered.
