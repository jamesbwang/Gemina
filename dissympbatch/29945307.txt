  Immuno-related hemocytopenia ( IRH) is defined as idiopathic cytopenia<symptom> of undetermined significance ( ICUS) patients with autoantibodies. In our previous studies , we found that IgG1 levels were increased in IRH patients and might cause the destruction of hematopoietic cells. In this study , we analyzed IgG subclasses in 30 IRH patients ( male: female = 13:17 , median age 32 years , range 18- 56) , 15 IRH remission patients ( IRH-R) ( male: female = 6:9 , median age 34 , range 20- 52) and 20 normal controls ( male: female = 8:12 , median age 27 , range 24- 36) by Cytometric Bead Array , Flow Cytometry and Immunohistochemical staining. Levels of IgG1/IgG3 in the bone<disease> marrow supernatant of IRH patents , as well as the proportion of CD5 + B lymphocytes and Th2 cells ( CD3 + CD8-IL-4 +) were higher than those of IRH-R patients and normal controls , and IgG1 levels had a positive correlation with the proportion of Th2 cells. In IRH patients , IgG1 and IgG3 were positive on nucleated erythrocytes and granulocytes , which were negative in IRH-R patients and healthy controls and had inverse correlations with hematopoietic function. Using immunohistochemical staining , IgG1 were also detected on bone<disease> marrow biopsies of IRH patients. The results indicated that IgG1 and IgG3 autoantibodies in IRH patients might play a key role in the IRH pathogenesis and in the abnormal immune function of IRH patients.
