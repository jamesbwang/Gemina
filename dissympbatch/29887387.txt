  To evaluate and compare readmission causes and timing within the first 30 days after hospitalization for 3 acute and 3 chronic common pediatric conditions. Data from the 2013 to 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database were used to examine the daily percentage of readmissions occurring on days 1-30 and the leading causes of readmission after hospitalization for 3 acute ( appendicitis<disease> , bronchiolitis/croup , and gastroenteritis<disease> and 3 chronic ( asthma , epilepsy , and sickle cell) conditions for patients aged 1-17 years ( n = 2753488). Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. The 30-day readmission rates ranged from 2.6 % ( SE , 0.1) after hospitalizations for appendectomy to 19.1 % ( SE , 0.5) after hospitalizations for sickle cell anemia<symptom> More than 50 % of 30-day readmissions after acute conditions occurred within 15 days after discharge , whereas readmissions after chronic conditions occurred more uniformly throughout the 30 days after discharge. Higher numbers of patient comorbidities were associated with increased risk of readmission at days 1-7 , 8-15 , and 16-30 after discharge for all conditions examined. Most 30-day readmissions after chronic conditions were for the same diagnosis or closely related conditions as the index admission ( 67 % for asthma , 65 % for seizure<symptom> disorder , and 82 % for sickle cell anemia<symptom> in contrast with 50 % or fewer readmissions after acute conditions ( 46 % for appendectomy , 47 % for bronchiolitis/croup , and 19 % for gastroenteritis<disease> The timing and causes of pediatric readmissions vary greatly across pediatric conditions. To be effective , strategies for reducing readmissions need to account for the index diagnosis to better target the highest risk period and causes for readmission.
