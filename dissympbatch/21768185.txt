  Headaches<symptom> due to airplane travel are rare but documented in the literature. We aim to provide a review of diagnostic criteria and treatment for this condition. Several cases of this syndrome<disease> have been reported since it was first described in 2004. Airplane headache<symptom> is classified as unilateral , stabbing , orbito-frontal pain , lasting under 30 min , and occurs during ascent or descent of a plane. Patients with this condition can develop anxiety<symptom> and fear of flying given the intensity and severity of the pain. The pathophysiology of this syndrome<disease> is unknown , but theories include suspected barotrauma given changes in barometric pressure during ascent and descent. There are no randomized controlled trials regarding treatment , but case reports suggest headache<symptom> prevention with pre-treatment with naproxen , decongestants , and triptans prior to air travel. Some non-pharmacological therapies reported include Valsalva maneuvers , chewing , relaxation techniques , and pressure at the pain area. As more cases of headache<symptom> attributed to airplane travel are reported , epidemiological data can be obtained to further understand the incidence and prevalence of this condition , which can lead to improved treatment options for patients.
