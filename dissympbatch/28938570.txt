  Programmed cell death-ligands 1 ( PD-L1) is a key immune checkpoint protein and a promising therapeutic target for malignancy tumor immunotherapy. The prognostic value of PD-L1 in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcoma<disease> remains controversial. Therefore , this meta-analysis is conducted to evaluate the associations of PD-L1 expression with overall survival ( OS) , progression-free survival ( PFS) , and clinicopathological characteristics of sarcomaA comprehensive literature search of PubMed , Web of Science , Embase , and Cochrane Library was conducted for relevant studies. A total of 14 studies published from 2013 to 2017 were included. The pooled hazard ratios ( HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were extracted from included studies to assess the association between PD-L1 expression and OS , PFS of patients with sarcoma<disease>. Other relevant data were extracted to evaluate the correlations of PD-L1 expression with risk and clinicopathological characteristics of sarcoma<disease>. Stata 12.0 software was applied to calculate the strength of association between PD-L1 expression and sarcoma.In total , 14 articles containing 15 independent studies and 1,451 patients were included in this meta-analysis. We found that the high PD-L1 expression was associated with poorer overall survival ( HR 1.27 , 95 % CI: 0.70-1.84 P = .000) and poorer events-free survival ( HR 2.05 , 95 % CI: 1.55-2.70 , P = .000) in bone and soft-tissue sarcoma<disease> patients. Additionally , we conducted subgroup analysis according to histology type , ethnicity , target of PD-L1 assessment , cutoff , the significant correlations with poor overall survival and events-free survival were also observed. In contrast none of the clinicopathological characteristics ( gender , age , tumor site , tumor grade , tumor depth , tumor necrosis<symptom> rate , metastasis , recurrence , chemotherapy , radiotherapy) was found to be associated with PD-L1 expression in our analysis.The findings from this meta-analysis indicate that PD-L1 expression might be a useful predicative factor of poor prognosis for patients with bone and soft tissue
