  Acute pericarditis<disease> as a presenting sign of adrenal insufficiency is rarely reported. We present a rare case that highlights pericarditis<disease> as a clinical presentation of secondary adrenal insufficiency later complicated by cardiac tamponade. A 44-year-old lady who presented to the hospital with a one-day history of pleuritic<symptom> chest<symptom> pain<symptom> and shortness of breath. In the emergency room , she had a blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> of 70/35 mmHg. Laboratory evaluation revealed white blood cell count of 16.08 k/cumm with neutrophilia , normal renal function and elevated troponin ( 0.321 ng/mL , normal 0.000-0.028). An electrocardiogram ( EKG) showed sinus tachycardia<symptom> , low voltage , PR suppression and ST changes consistent with acute pericarditis<disease> Echocardiogram showed small pericardial<symptom> effusion<symptom> without tamponade physiology. Infectious workup was negative; she was thought to have acute adrenal insufficiency likely secondary to viral pericarditis<disease> We treated the patient with high dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDS) and hydrocortisone. Three weeks later , she presented to emergency room with complaints of persistent nausea<symptom> , vomiting , chills<symptom> , weakness<symptom>. Her blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> was 49/23 mmHg. Random serum cortisol level was < 1.2 mcg/dl ( normal A.M. specimens 3.7-19.4 mcg/dl). Echocardiogram showed loculated pericardial fluid adjacent to the right ventricle with echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. Emergent pericardiocentesis yielded 250 ml of straw color fluid. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> improved after the procedure. The patient was initially started on IV stress dose steroids , but following clinical stabilization , hydrocortisone was switched to a physiological dose of 15 mg in am and 10 mg in pm. Although the mechanism of pericarditis<disease> in adrenal failure is unknown , this clinical presentation may help early diagnosis of adrenal failure and pericarditis<disease> Early recognition and prompt treatment of this rare presentation are critical to prevent morbidity and mortality.
