  Troponin I is a cardiac enzyme that is released during myocardial injury. However , cardiac enzymes are non-specific and can occur in many cardiac and non-cardiac pathologies. We aim to ( 1) describe the range of acute conditions that were associated with raised troponins in the paediatric population in our institution and ( 2) quantify the extent of troponin elevation and correlate it with the underlying aetiology. We performed a retrospective observational study in a tertiary institution which included patients from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013. We identified patients with troponin I levels of more than 0.1 ng/ml who have not had cardiac surgery before. We recorded their final diagnoses , and then compared the peak troponin levels and the eventual final diagnoses. We identified 100 patients. The top few common diagnoses resulting in a raised troponin were sepsis<disease> ( 29 %) , cardiac pathologies ( 29 %) such as tachyarrhythmias and cardiomyopathies and myocarditis<disease> ( 21 %). Other pathologies included trauma and other causes of multiorgan dysfunction. The median peak troponin I was higher in cardiac as compared to non-cardiac pathologies: 2.15 ( 0.52-15.0) and 0.44 ( 0.21-1.68) , respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the peak troponin I values in the presence of hypotension<symptom> or renal impairment. We described the range of conditions that may result in raised troponin I levels. The extent of raised troponin I levels may potentially be useful in differentiating between cardiac and non-cardiac pathologies. However , further studies on a larger scale are required to establish whether extent of troponin I elevation has a diagnostic role for cardiac pathologies.
