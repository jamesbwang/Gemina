  Whilst the link between physical factors and risk of high altitude ( HA)- related illness and acute mountain<disease> sickness ( AMS) have been extensively explored , the influence of psychological factors has been less well examined. In this study we aimed to investigate the relationship between ` anxiety<symptom> and AMS risk during a progressive ascent to very HA. Eighty health adults were assessed at baseline ( 848m) and over 9 consecutive altitudes during a progressive trek to 5140m. HA-related symptoms ( Lake Louise ( LLS) and AMS-C Scores) and state anxiety<symptom> ( State-Trait-Anxiety-Score ( STAI Y-1)) were examined at each altitude with trait anxiety<symptom> ( STAI Y-2) at baseline. The average age was 32.1 ± 8.3 years ( 67.5 % men). STAI Y-1 scores fell from 848m to 3619m , before increasing to above baseline scores ( 848m) at ≥ 4072m ( p = 0.01). STAI Y-1 scores correlated with LLS ( r = 0.31; 0.24-0.3; P < 0.0001) and AMS-C Scores ( r = 0.29; 0.22-0.35; P < 0.0001). There was significant main effect for sex ( higher STAI Y-1 scores in women) and altitude with no sex-x-altitude interaction on STAI Y-1 Scores. Independent predictors of significant state anxiety<symptom> included female sex , lower age , higher heart rate and increasing LLS and AMS-C scores ( p < 0.0001). A total of 38/80 subjects ( 47.5 %) developed AMS which was mild in 20 ( 25 %) and severe in 18 ( 22.5 %). Baseline STAI Y-2 scores were an independent predictor of future severe AMS ( B = 1.13; 1.009-1.28; p = 0.04; r2 = 0.23) and STAI Y-1 scores at HA independently predicted AMS and its severity. Trait anxiety<symptom> at low altitude was an independent predictor of future severe AMS development at HA. State anxiety<symptom> at HA was independently associated with AMS and its severity.
