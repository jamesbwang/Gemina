  This study aimed to identify whether quick sequential organ<symptom> failure<symptom> assessment ( qSOFA) performed immediately upon arrival can predict the outcome of patients with glyphosate surfactant herbicide ( GlySH) poisoning<disease>. Adult patients with GlySH poisoning<disease> between January 2006 and April 2017 were included in this retrospective observational study. The qSOFA score ( respiratory rate â‰¥ 22 breaths per min , systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> < 100 mmHg , and altered<symptom> mental<symptom> status<symptom>) was assessed immediately upon arrival at the emergency department. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality , and the secondary outcomes were life threatening complications and organ injury. Of the 150 patients who ingested GlySH , 14 ( 9.3 %) died. The qSOFA score was significantly higher in the non-survival group ( P < 0.001). qSOFA ( odds ratio ( OR) , 2.73; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.41-5.76) was independently associated with in-hospital mortality. The area under curve value of qSOFA was 0.841 ( 95 % CI , 0.772-0.895). As qSOFA score increased from 0 to 3 , the in-hospital mortality significantly increased ( P < 0.001). The frequency of life-threatening complications , including organ injury , increased as the qSOFA score increased from 0 to 3 ( P < 0.001). The qSOFA score measured upon arrival shows good prognostic performance in patients with GlySH poisoning<disease>. Moreover , the qSOFA may predict the development of life-threatening complications including organ injury. Thus , more attention should be paid to patients with GlySH poisoning<disease> with higher qSOFA scores.
