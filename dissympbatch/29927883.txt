  To describe thyroid eye disease ( TED)- like orbital inflammatory syndrome<disease> in 3 cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. All consecutive patients treated by the senior author who were receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors and developed TED-like orbital inflammation<symptom> were included. Three cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors developed orbital inflammation<symptom>. The first patient was treated with a combination of a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibitor and a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor and developed TED-like orbital inflammation<symptom> with normal thyroid function and antibody levels. The second patient had a previous diagnosis of Graves disease without TED , and developed TED soon after initiating treatment with a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor. The third patient developed acute hyperthyroidism with symptomatic TED following treatment with an investigational cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibitor agent. All 3 patients were managed with either systemic steroids or observation , with resolution of their symptoms and without the need to halt immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for their cancer. TED-like orbital inflammation<symptom> may occur as a side effect of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 or anti-PD-1 inhibitors. To the best of their knowledge , this is the first reported case of TED as a result of programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor monotherapy. All 3 patients were treated with systemic steroids and responded quickly while continuing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors for their cancer. With increasing use of this class of drugs , clinicians should be familiar with the clinical manifestations and treatments for this adverse reaction.
