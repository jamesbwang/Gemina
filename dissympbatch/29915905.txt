  We set out to synthesize available data on antithrombotic strategies for patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) , with a focus on triple antithrombotic therapy ( triple therapy ( TT); dual antiplatelet therapy plus an anticoagulant) versus dual therapy ( DT; one antiplatelet agent and an anticoagulant). We searched OVID MEDLINE and PubMed from January 2005 to September 2017 using the search terms oral anticoagulant , triple therapy , dual therapy , acute coronary syndrome<disease> , percutaneous coronary intervention , and atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( limited to randomized controlled trials , observational studies , English language , minimum 6-12 months of follow-up , minimum 100 human patients). We excluded surveys , literature reviews , articles not directly related to TT versus DT , incomplete studies , and short-term in-hospital studies. All eligible studies were reviewed to evaluate possible antithrombotic management strategies for patients with AF undergoing PCI. Extracted studies were categorized according to the specific anticoagulant ( vitamin K antagonist vs. direct-acting oral anticoagulant) and P2Y
