  Recently characterized interferon epsilon ( IFNe) protects against sexually transmitted infections , including genital<disease> herpes<disease> simplex<disease> virus ( HSV) , in animal models. There are no reports of IFNe in genital tract secretions of pregnant women , and data on IFNe in non-pregnant women are limited. This pilot study is the first to measure concentrations of IFNe in vaginal and cervical secretions during pregnancy and compare values between healthy and genital HSV-infected women. Vaginal or cervical specimens from 30 pregnant women were obtained from the Global Alliance to Prevent Prematurity and Stillbirth<symptom> ( GAPPS) repository. Cervical samples were collected during the first trimester and vaginal samples across pregnancy. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay determined concentrations of IFNe ( pg/mL). Data for IFNe were log-transformed and compared by maternal demographics , clinical variables , and HSV status using t tests and linear regression. Repeated measures analysis explored trends across pregnancy. Among the entire cohort , first trimester concentrations of IFNe in vaginal or cervical secretions decreased as body mass index increased ( Î² = -0.14 , P = .0466). Concentrations of vaginal IFNe increased across pregnancy in HSV-infected and healthy women ( P = .009). Average vaginal IFNe across pregnancy was lower in women with HSV compared to healthy women ( P = .0009). Interferon epsilon increased across pregnancy , but was less abundant in women with HSV. This pilot investigation can not make any definitive conclusions. However , animal models suggest that IFNe may protect against STIs. Thus , larger studies are required to validate expression of IFNe in the reproductive tract of pregnant women with and without
