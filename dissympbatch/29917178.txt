  To investigate whether microRNA-485-5p ( miR-485-5p) can participate in osteoarthritis by inhibiting chondrogenic differentiation of bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs) and promoting the secretion of inflammatory factors. BMSCs were obtained from mouse bone<disease> marrow samples and identified by flow cytometry. The expression of specific genes and miR-485-5p in the differentiation of BMSCs was detected by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR). The influence of miR-485-5p on chondrogenic differentiation was subsequently evaluated by toluidine blue staining , detection of chondrogenic specific gene expression and inflammatory factors. After over-expressing SOX9 , it was assessed whether miR-485-5p can affect the chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs by inhibiting SOX9 , so as to promote the secretion of inflammatory factors. The miR-485-5p level was negatively correlated with the degree of differentiation of BMSCs. After overexpression of microRNA-485-5p in BMSCs , the expression of cartilage surface marker genes and toluidine blue staining were reduced , while the expression of cartilage surface inflammation<symptom> factors , including interleukin and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor , was significantly enhanced. Meanwhile , opposite results were observed when miR-485-5p was inhibited. In addition , overexpression of SOX9 could restore the secretion of inflammatory cytokines induced by microRNA-485-5p. MiR-485-5p can decrease the level of SOX9 , promote the production of inflammatory factors on the cartilage surface , and block the differentiation of mouse BMSCs into chondrocytes.
