  This study compared the diagnostic outcomes of visual inspection ( VI) , digital bitewing radiography ( BWR) , and near-infrared light transillumination ( NIR-LT , DIAGNOcam , KaVo , Biberach , Germany) for occlusal caries<disease> detection and assessment of posterior teeth. This study included 203 patients ( mean age 23.0 years). All individuals received a meticulous VI. Additionally , BWR and NIR-LT images were collected. All BWR and NIR-LT images were blindly evaluated for the presence of enamel caries<disease> lesions<symptom> ( ECLs) and dentin caries<disease> lesions<symptom> ( DCLs). The descriptive statistical analyses included calculation of frequencies , cross tabulations , and pairwise comparisons using Pearson chi-square tests. The majority of ECLs/DCLs were detected by VI in this low-risk adult population. The additional diagnostic outcomes in terms of ECLs/DCLs amounted to 5.0 % ( BWR) and 6.8 % ( NIR-LT). The combined usage of VI/NIR-LT or VI/BWR identified 95.7 and 94.4 % of all ECLs/DCLs on occlusal surfaces , respectively. This comparative diagnostic study showed that VI detected the majority of occlusal caries<disease> lesions<symptom>. Both additional methods showed limited benefits. Due to the valuable features of NIR-LT , i.e. , X-ray freeness and clinical practicability , this method might be preferred over X-ray-based methods. Nevertheless , BWRs should be prescribed in clinical situations where insufficient fillings or multiple ( deep) caries<disease> lesions<symptom> are diagnosed or where there is a need to assess the caries<disease> extension in relation to the pulp. VI has to be understood as caries<disease> detection method of choice on occlusal surfaces in low-risk adult population which may help to avoid multiple diagnostic testing , overdiagnosis , and overtreatment.
