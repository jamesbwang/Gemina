  Cardiac repolarization of black athletes has a distinctive pattern. During an episode of pericarditis<disease> , this pattern may evolve into a `` pseudonormalized '' electrocardiography ( ECG). On resolution of the pericardial inflammation<symptom> , the ECG may return to the normal variant for a black athlete , sounding the alarms of extended disease to the myocardium. Recognizing the normal variant for a black athlete will reduce the need for unnecessary further testing or treatments. The case is discussed in detail.
