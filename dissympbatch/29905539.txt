  The main goal of the research was to study echinococcosis liver cyst<symptom> laparoscopic treatment 's effectiveness. The retrospective analysis of liver echinococcosis cyst<symptom> surgical treatment in the period from 2003 to 2013 years was conducted. 348 patients underwent surgical treatment , among them 283 patients- laparoscopic procedure , 65- open surgery. Medial age was 42,3 ± 7,9 years. Female- 214 , male- 134. 249 patients underwent laparoscopic partial ( conservative) cystectomy , 34- laparoscopic radical cystectomy with liver resection , 3 ( 1 %)- conversion. 47 patients underwent partial ( conservative) cystectomy using open approach. 18- radical cystectomy using either typical or atypical hemihepatectomy. A long term analysis of 226 ( 79,8 %) patients in a period from 6 month to 7 years was conducted. Comparison of the results revealed the advantage of laparoscopic operations. It was manifested in less blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , duration of the procedure , pain syndrome<disease> , and a smaller number of bed-days. Infections of the residual cavity after open surgery were twice as much comparing to ones after laparoscopic surgery. Complications after open surgery were significantly higher than after laparoscopic procedures due to postoperative wound<disease> infections<disease> After open surgery frequency of echinococcosis recurrence was higher than after laparoscopic one ( 8,5 % vs 2,5 %) ( р < 0,05). Nowadays it is possible to say that treatment of choice of noncomplicated liver echinococceal cysts<symptom> is laparoscopic one. Correctly made laparoscopical procedure has a good long term results , few postoperative compications , less frequent recurrences and the excellent cosmetic effect. From the principles of radical surgical treatment 's point of view laparoscopic approach is the same as an open surgery.
