  Patients with COPD may experience acute mountain<disease> sickness ( AMS) and other altitude-related adverse health effects ( ARAHE) when traveling to high altitudes. This study evaluated whether dexamethasone , a drug used for the prevention of AMS in healthy individuals , would prevent AMS/ARAHE in patients with COPD. This placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel-design trial included patients with COPD and Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease grade 1 to 2 who were living below 800 m. Patients were randomized to receive dexamethasone ( 8 mg/d) or placebo starting on the day before ascent and while staying in a high-altitude clinic at 3,100 m for 2 days. The primary outcome assessed during the altitude sojourn was the combined incidence of AMS/ARAHE , defined as an Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire cerebral score evaluating AMS â‰¥ 0.7 or ARAHE requiring descent or an intervention. In 60 patients randomized to receive dexamethasone ( median ( quartiles) age: 57 years ( 50; 60) , FEV In lowlanders with mild to moderate COPD , the incidence of AMS/ARAHE at 3,100 m was moderate and not reduced by dexamethasone treatment. Based on these findings , dexamethasone can not be recommended for the prevention of AMS/ARAHE in patients with COPD undertaking high-altitude travel , although the drug mitigated the altitude-induced hypoxemia<symptom>.
