  We aimed to evaluate the association of the patient-reported outcomes for rectal bleeding and stool<symptom> frequency among patients with ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) in endoscopic remission. We performed a systematic review of studies reporting the association of patient-reported outcomes ( the patient-reported components of the Mayo score: rectal bleeding and stool<symptom> frequency) and endoscopic remission ( Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1). We performed a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy using the hierarchical bivariate method. Our meta-analysis consisted of 5 studies comprising 2132 participants. A rectal bleeding subscore of 0 identified patients in endoscopic remission with a pooled sensitivity value of 81 % ( 95 % CI , 73 % -86 %) , a specificity value of 68 % ( 95 % CI , 61 % -75 %) , a positive likelihood ratio ( LR) of 2.5 ( 95 % CI , 2.2-3.0) , and a negative LR of 0.28 ( 95 % CI , 0.22-0.37). A stool<symptom> frequency subscore of 0 identified patients in endoscopic remission with a pooled sensitivity value of 40 % ( 95 % CI , 25 % -58 %) , a specificity value of 93 % ( 95 % CI , 86 % -97 %) , a positive LR of 6.0 ( 95 % CI , 3.7-9.7) , and negative LR of 0.64 ( 95 % CI , 0.50-0.82). A combined rectal bleeding and stool<symptom> frequency subscore of 0 identified patients in endoscopic remission with a pooled sensitivity value of 36 % ( 95 % CI , 22 % -54 %) , a specificity value of 96 % ( 95 % CI , 91 % -98 %) , a positive LR or 8.4 ( 95 % CI , 5.5-12.8) , and a negative LR or 0.66 ( 95 % CI , 0.53-0.84). In a meta-analysis of 5 studies , we found that most patients with UC and normal rectal bleeding and stool<symptom> frequency subscores have attained endoscopic remission. Many patients in endoscopic remission from UC have no rectal bleeding. Normal stool<symptom> frequency associates with endoscopic remission , but many patients have abnormal stool<symptom> frequencies despite endoscopic remission. These results should be carefully considered given the high heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals for some outcomes.
