  Metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) is a highly prevalent disorder which can be used to identify individuals with a higher risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. This metabolic syndrome<disease> is characterized by a combination of physiological , metabolic , and molecular alterations such as insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , and central obesity. The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 ( LRP1-- A member of the LDL receptor family) is an endocytic and signaling receptor that is expressed in several tissues. It is involved in the clearance of chylomicron remnants from circulation , and has been demonstrated to play a key role in the lipid metabolism at the hepatic level. Recent studies have shown that LRP1 is involved in insulin receptor ( IR) trafficking and intracellular signaling activity , which have an impact on the regulation of glucose homeostasis in adipocytes , muscle cells , and brain. In addition , LRP1 has the potential to inhibit or sustain inflammation<symptom> in macrophages , depending on its cellular expression , as well as the presence of particular types of ligands in the extracellular microenvironment. In this review , we summarize existing perspectives and the latest innovations concerning the role of tissue-specific LRP1 in lipoprotein and glucose metabolism , and examine its ability to mediate inflammatory processes related to MetS and atherosclerosis.
