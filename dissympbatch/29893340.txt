  Primary mediastinal synovial sarcomas<disease> are exceedingly uncommon tumors. Herein , we present the case of primary mediastinal synovial sarcoma<disease> ( monophasic spindle cell-shaped variant) fully occupying the right hemithorax in a 37-year-old woman who presented to clinic with a 2-month history of right-sided chest<symptom> pain<symptom> and shortness of breath. Although extremely rare , however , synovial sarcoma<disease> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all monophasic and biphasic spindle cell neoplasms of the mediastinum. Despite molecular testing for ( t ( x; 18) ( p11 .2; q11 .2)) is characteristically positive in 90 % of synovial sarcoma<disease> cases , it is not routinely done. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses can greatly confirm the diagnosis. Optimal surgical resection is the standard of care. Adjuvant therapy ( radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy) is indicated in inoperable advanced disease or unachieved surgical tumor-free surgical margins. Prognosis is poor with a 5-year overall survival ( OS) rate of 35.7 %. Early diagnosis and prompt appropriate management yield better disease-free and OS rates.
