  Cutaneous<disease> wound<disease> healing consists of three main phases: inflammation<symptom> , re-epithelialization , and tissue remodeling. During normal wound<disease> healing , these processes are tightly regulated to allow restoration of skin function and biomechanics. In many instances , healing leads to an excess accumulation of fibrillar collagen ( the principal protein found in the extracellular matrix- ECM) , and the formation of scar tissue , which has compromised biomechanics , tested using ramp to failure tests , compared to normal skin ( Corr and Hart , 2013 ( 1)). Alterations in collagen accumulation and architecture have been attributed to the reduced tensile strength found in scar tissue ( Brenda et al. , 1999; Eleswarapu et al. , 2011). Defining mechanisms that govern cellular functionality and ECM remodeling are vital to understanding normal versus pathological healing and developing approaches to prevent scarring. CD44 is a cell surface adhesion receptor expressed on nearly all cell types present in dermis. Although CD44 has been implicated in an array of inflammatory and fibrotic processes such as leukocyte recruitment , T-cell extravasation , and hyaluronic acid ( the principal glycosaminoglycan found in the ECM) metabolism , the role of CD44 in cutaneous<disease> wound<disease> healing and scarring remains unknown. We demonstrate that in an excisional biopsy punch wound<disease> healing model , CD44-null mice have increased inflammatory and reduced fibrogenic responses during early phases of wound<disease> healing. At wound<disease> closure , CD44-null mice exhibit reduced collagen degradation leading to increased accumulation of fibrillar collagen , which persists after wound<disease> closure leading to reduced tensile strength resulting in a more severe scarring phenotype compared to WT mice. These data indicate that CD44 plays a previously unknown role in fibrillar collagen accumulation and wound<disease> healing during the injury response.
