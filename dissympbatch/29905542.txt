  Preterm labor is an urgent medical-social and demographic issue at the present stage. A considerable number of factors affects the course of pregnancy and its outcome , their effect is realized at the level of the central nervous system through numerical metabolic interactions , where monoaminergic systems play an important role. Objective- to study the features of the sympathoadrenal system state by determining the excretion level of DOPHA , dopamine , norepinephrine and epinephrine in women 's daily urine with different periods of abortion<disease> 227 pregnant women who were admitted to the Kharkiv perinatal center have been examined , 190 of them had clinical signs of premature delivery in the gestation period of 23-36 weeks. Formation of clinical groups was carried out depending on the pregnancy term in the form of premature and timely delivery. Diagnosis of preterm labor was carried out in the presence of abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> syndrome<disease> and structural changes in the cervix. Consequently , pregnancy compensatory and adaptive mechanisms are complex of neurohumoral process , which are realized through monoaminergic systems and a significant factor in its interruption is their destabilization. Reducing of sympathoadrenal system activity and reserve capacity in pregnant women may be a pathogenetic factor in the development of preterm labor. Therefore determination of the imbalance initial manifestations in the catecholamines exchange may possibly prevent the loss of pregnancy in the early stages.
