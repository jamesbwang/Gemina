  Night Eating Syndrome<disease> has been shown to be associated with various negative physical and psychological consequences. This study explored the relationship between neuroticism and night eating , which had not been studied before. We also examined the possible mediating roles of psychological distress and maladaptive coping for the relationship between neuroticism and night eating. A sample of 578 Chinese college students were assessed on several measures: The Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Short Scale , the Night Eating Questionnaire , the Depression<symptom> Anxiety<symptom> Stress Scales , and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Results indicated that neuroticism was significantly and positively related to night eating ( r = .38 , p < .01) , and the relationship between neuroticism and night eating was partially mediated by psychological distress , but not by maladaptive coping. The results not only revealed a medium-sized relationship between neuroticism and night eating , but also pointed out the importance of psychological distress as related to the relationship between neuroticism and night eating. Unlike neuroticism , which is a personality trait , psychological distress is an emotional state , and it is much more malleable through appropriate intervention. The treatment and intervention for night eating may benefit from our attention to the psychological distress.
