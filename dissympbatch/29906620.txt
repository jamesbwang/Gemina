  Unfavorable environmental conditions and inappropriate culture practices have increased the vulnerability of cultured fish to disease infection<disease>. Up to date many studies have aimed to determine a feeding regimen to maximize productivity; however , very little information on immune responses of cultured fish in response to underfeeding or overfeeding is available. Therefore , a preliminary study was conducted to evaluate effects of graded feeding levels ( i.e. , food availability) on growth performance and immune-related gene expression of juvenile olive flounder ( Paralichthys olivaceus). Six different feeding rates including 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 , and 16 % body<symptom> weight per day ( BW/d) were randomly assigned to three replicate tanks stocking 150 fish ( average initial body<symptom> weight: 0.27 ± 0.02 g; mean ± SD) per tank. A feeding trial lasted for two weeks. Based on the results of the weight gain , nutrient gain , and whole-body compositions and energy content , the feeding rate of 10 % , 13 % , and 16 % BW/d resulted in high nutritional status , whereas the feeding rate of 1 % and 4 % BW/d resulted in low nutritional status. Intermediate nutritional status was observed at the feeding rate of 7 % BW/d. In the given rearing conditions the optimum feeding rate resulting in the maximum growth was estimated to be 11.9 % BW/d based on the quadratic broken-line regression model , chosen as the best-fit model among the tested models. Expression of immune-related genes including IL-8 and IgM was significantly down-regulated in the flounder fed at 1 % BW/d in comparison to those fed at 7 % BW/d. Interestingly , expression of these genes in the flounder fed at 10 % , 13 % , and 16 % BW/d was relatively down-regulated in comparison to that of the flounder fed at 7 % BW/d. Although no statistical difference was detected , overall response patterns of other immune-related genes , including TLR3 , polymeric Ig receptor , lysozyme C-type , GPx , SOD , and Trx followed what IL-8 and IgM exhibited in response to the various feeding rates. Given the current challenges in aquaculture of the flounder our findings suggest to prohibit underfeeding or overfeeding ( i.e. , ad-libitum feeding) when culturing the young flounder.
