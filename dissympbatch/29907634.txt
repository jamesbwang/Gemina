  Trachoma<disease> is the leading infectious cause of blindness<symptom>. Until recently , reliable data on the global extent of the disease , detailed plans for elimination , and government , donor and partner engagement were all inadequate. The trachoma<disease> community undertook a systematic , three-pronged strategy to map trachoma<disease> district by district , develop national-level trachoma<disease> elimination plans , and create a framework for governments , donors and partners to convene and coordinate in support of trachoma<disease> elimination. There has been a frame-shift in internal and external perceptions of the global trachoma<disease> programme , from being an effort working towards disease control in focussed geographical areas , to one in the process of achieving worldwide disease elimination. Multiple factors contributed to the successful implementation of mapping , planning , and cross-sectional engagement of governments , partners and donors. Elimination of trachoma<disease> is possible if the right combination of factors is in place. Planning for success is a critical first step. Some remaining challenges must still be addressed if the elimination targets are to be successfully attained.
