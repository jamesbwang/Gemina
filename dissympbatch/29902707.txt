  Lysosomes are the most acidic vesicles within mammalian cells and are promising targets for the treatment of breast cancer , glioblastomas and acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML). Our previous studies have shown that chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL) cells are also sensitive to lysosome disruption and cell death , by siramesine or chemotherapy. In the present study , we screened the antimalarial drugs , mefloquine , atovaquone , primaquine , and tafenoquine , for their effects on lysosome disruption and cytotoxicity in primary CLL cells. We found that mefloquine and tafenoquine could permeabilize lysosome membranes<symptom> and induce cell death at doses that are clinically achievable. In contrast , these agents had less effect on normal B cells. Tafenoquine was most effective at inducing cell death , and this was associated with increased formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) and lipid peroxidation. Addition of ROS scavengers blocked both tafenoquine- and mefloquine-induced cell death. Moreover , blocking the activity of cathepsins released from the lysosomes decreased tafenoquine-induced cell death. Taken together , lysosome disruption using antimalarial drugs is a novel approach for the treatment of CLL.
