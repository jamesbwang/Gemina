  Relative adrenal insufficiency ( RAI) has been reported in critically ill patients with cirrhosis. We evaluated the prevalence of RAI and its relationship to clinical course in non-septic cirrhosis patients with ascites. The study included 66 consecutive non-septic cirrhosis patients with ascites. RAI was defined by a delta cortisol lower than 9 μg/dL and/or a peak cortisol lower than 18 μg/dL. Sixty-six patients with cirrhosis and ascites were studied. The mean Child-Turcotte-Pugh ( CTP) and model for end stage liver disease ( MELD) scores were 10.6 ± 1.9 and 21.5 ± 7.3 , respectively. The prevalence of RAI in patients with cirrhosis and ascites was 47 % ( 31/66). The prevalence of RAI in patients with and without spontaneous bacterial peritonitis<disease> , renal<symptom> failure<symptom> and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome<disease> ( HRS) was comparable. Baseline hyponatremia was common in RAI ( 42 % versus 17 % , p = 0.026). There was a significant correlation of prevalence of RAI with prothrombin time , international normalized ratio , MELD scores and CTP class. During follow-up , there was no association between RAI and the risk to develop new infections , severe sepsis<disease> , type 1 HRS and death. RAI is common in non-septic cirrhotic patients with ascites and its prevalence increases with severity of liver disease. However , it does not affect the short-term outcome in these patients.
