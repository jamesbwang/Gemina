  Interleukin ( IL) -32 , also named natural killer cell transcript 4 ( NK4) , has increasingly been described as an immunoregulator that controls cell differentiation and cell death and is involved in the stimulation of anti-/ pro-inflammatory cytokines. Abnormal presence of IL-32 has been repeatedly noticed during the pathogenesis of allergic , infectious , cancerous , and inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>. Of particular note was the observation of the anti-inflammatory property of IL-32 in a murine ovalbumin model of allergic asthma. Compared to wild-type mice , IL-32Î³ transgenic mice show decreased levels of inflammatory cells , recruited eosinophils , and lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in a mouse model of acute asthma. To date , the molecular mechanism underlying the role of IL-32 in asthma remains to be elucidated. This review aims to summarize recent advances in the pathophysiology of asthma and describe the links to IL-32. The possibilities of using IL-32 as an airway inflammation<symptom> biomarker and an asthma therapeutic agent are also evaluated.
