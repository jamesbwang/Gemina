  The Non Interventional Evaluation with Golumimab ( GO-NICE) study aimed to document patient and treatment characteristics as well as clinical effectiveness and safety in adult patients newly treated with the tumour necrosis<symptom> factor inhibitor golimumab ( GLM). Prospective non-interventional study with 24-month observation per patient. 158 office-based and clinical-based physicians in Germany. GLM administered in the 50 mg dose subcutaneously in monthly intervals under real-life conditions. Of the 1613 included patients , 1458 patients were eligible for final analysis: 474 patients with rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA , 54.9 ± 13.4 years , 72.8 % women , 64.7 % biologic-naïve) , 501 with psoriatic arthritis<disease> ( PsA , 50.5 ± 12.1 years , 54.1 % women , 56.5 % biologic-naïve) and 483 with ankylosing spondylitis ( AS , 43.6 ± 12.3 years , 66.5 % men , 61.0 % biologic-naïve). 664 patients completed follow-up ( 2-year retention rate 45.5 %). Disease Activity Score 28-joint count erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( DAS28-ESR) decreased from 5.0 to 2.9 after 24 months ( p < 0.0001) in patients with RA , and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Index score decreased from 5.1 to 2.4 ( p < 0.0001) in patients with AS. Response rate calculated in patients with PsA by modified Psoriatic Arthritis<disease> Response Criteria was 67.9 % after 24 months. Most adverse events were of mild or moderate nature , and no new safety signals were detected. According to the physicians ' clinical assessments , treatment with GLM was successful ( no adverse drug reaction and a clear or moderate therapeutic effect in an individual patient) in 55.0 % -56.6 % of patients with RA , PsA and AS , respectively , at month 3 , increasing from 74.5 % to 76.1 % at month 24. GLM subcutaneously once monthly led to substantial improvements in clinical effectiveness in patients with various inflammatory rheumatic diseases who could be followed up in a real-life setting in Germany. The treatment was well tolerated , and the safety profile of GLM was consistent with that observed in the previous randomised controlled trials. NCT01313858.
