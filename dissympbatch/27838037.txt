  Pheochromocytomas are rare catecholamine-secreting tumors arising from adrenomedullary chromaffin cells , usually causing hypertension , palpitation and headache<symptom> However , pheochromocytoma crisis , on the contrary , might present with hypotension<symptom> , multiple organ dysfunction or even mimicking other diseases , leaving physician with diagnostic difficulties. In this study , we present a case featured hypotension<symptom> , shock<symptom> and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome<disease> on admission , which nearly lead us to miss the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. A 14-year-old female student presented with cough<symptom> , hemoptysis<symptom> and dyspnea<symptom> for one week was reported. The laboratory test showed significantly increase in plasma norepinephrine and 24-hour urine norepinephrine , the enhanced CT of bilateral adrenal gland showed two round-like masses ( left: 4 × 5 × 3 cm; right: 6 × 4 × 3 cm) with soft tissue density in each adrenal gland. The post-surgical pathology confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. The resection of bilateral adrenal tumors was conducted after the preoperative medical treatment of phenoxybenzamine for two weeks. The patient underwent follow-up for a year and a half and showed no signs of recurrence. The diagnosis and treatment process of the patient in this study indicates us that when we meet a patient with hypotension<symptom> and multiple organ dysfunctions in a relatively short time , the suspicion of pheochromocytoma should not be missed.
