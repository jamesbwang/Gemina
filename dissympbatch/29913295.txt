  Postoperative epidural adhesion is a frequent cause of failed back surgery syndrome<disease> , manifesting with back and leg<symptom> pain<symptom> or neurologic deficits. Development of preventive measures for epidural adhesion after laminectomy is critical to improve outcomes of lumbar surgery. We hypothesized that positive effects of topical application of Contractubex ( CTX) gel and benzothiazole ( BT) individually and in combination could aid in preventing epidural fibrosis<disease> in a rat laminectomy model. Rats were randomly assigned to 2 control and 5 experimental groups ( n = 8 for each group). The control (-) group received no surgery , whereas the control ( +) group underwent laminectomy without any drug administration. In experimental groups , study agents applied to dura mater after laminectomy were 100mgCTX , 2.5 % BT , 5 % BT; 100mgCTXplus2 .5 % BT , and 100mgCTXplus5 % BT. Laminectomy was performed at the L3 level for all rats. The extent of epidural fibrosis<disease> was assessed 4 weeks later macroscopically and histopathologically. Hepatic and renal toxicity of study drugs was assessed histopathologically. Topical CTX and BT individually and in combination reduced epidural fibrosis<disease> after laminectomy in rats. Although a meaningful decrease of epidural fibrosis<disease> with individual application of CTX and BT ( 2.5 % or 5 %) was obtained ( P < 0.05) , the effect of their combination was more pronounced without meaningful hepatic and renal toxicity ( P < 0.05). Combined use of topical CTX and BT could be a potential therapy for epidural fibrosis<disease>. Further research with this agents for the prevention of epidural fibrosis<disease> is warranted.
