  Inability to resume employment after acute myocardial infarction ( MI) has important implications for patients. We sought to assess the prevalence of and outcomes associated with adverse change in employment after MI in a national US cohort. The TRANSLATE-ACS study ( Treatment with Adenosine Diphosphate Receptor Inhibitors: Longitudinal Assessment of Treatment Patterns and Events after Acute Coronary Syndrome<disease>) assessed employment status at baseline and 1 year among 9319 patients with MI ( mean age , 60.8 years; SD , 11.3; 27.3 % women) enrolled at 233 US hospitals. We defined adverse change in employment as patients working at baseline but working less or not working at 1-year post-MI. In multivariable models , we assessed factors associated with adverse change in employment and its association with patient-reported depression<symptom> , health status , persistence to evidence-based medications prescribed at discharge , and financial hardship affording medications. Half of the patients ( 51 %; n = 4730) were employed at the time of MI. By 1 year , 10 % ( n = 492) of these reported an adverse change in employment , with 3 % ( n = 143) working less and 7 % ( n = 349) no longer working ( only 27 of 349 reported retirement). Factors significantly associated with adverse change in employment included a number of unplanned readmissions , postdischarge bleeding complications , hypertension , and smoking. At 1 year , patients with an adverse change in employment were more likely to report depression<symptom> ( Patient Health Questionnaire 2 score > 3: 27.4 % versus 16.7 %) , lower health status ( mean EuroQoL visual analogue scale: 73 ( SD , 17.8) versus 78 ( SD , 14.8)) , and moderate-extreme financial hardship with medication costs ( 41.0 % versus 28.4 %; all Patients who experienced an adverse change in employment after MI reported lower quality of life , increased depression<symptom> , and more difficulty affording medications. These results underscore the need for interventions to address this patient-centered outcome and its health impact. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01088503.
