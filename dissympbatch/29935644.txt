  To report postoperative outcomes after surgery for deep endometriosis without involvement of the digestive or urinary tracts. Retrospective study using data prospectively recorded in the North-West Inter Regional Female Cohort for Patients with Endometriosis ( CIRENDO) database. University tertiary referral center. One hundred thirty consecutive patients whose follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 years. Laparoscopic excision of deep endometriosis nodules<symptom>. Postoperative complications were recorded in the CIRENDO database and medical charts. Postoperative digestive function was assessed using standardized gastrointestinal questionnaires: the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index and the Knowles-Eccersley-Scott Symptom Questionnaire. Deep endometriosis nodules<symptom> involved uterosacral ligaments , rectovaginal space , and vagina and spared the bowel , the bladder , and the ureters. Nodule<disease> size was < 1 cm , 1-3 cm , and > 3 cm in diameter in 20.8 % , 64.6 % , and 14.6 % of cases , respectively. Clavien-Dindo 1 , 2 , and 3b complications occurred in 0.8 % , 4.6 % , and 5.4 % of cases , respectively. Among Clavien-Dindo 3b complications , most involved pelvic hematoma. Gastrointestinal scores revealed significant improvement in digestive function or defecation pain at 1 and 3 years after surgery. The pregnancy rate was , respectively , 43.3 % and 56.7 % at 1 and 3 years postoperatively , among which 66.7 % and 64.7 % were spontaneous conceptions. Our data suggest that surgery for deep endometriosis without involvement of the digestive or urinary tracts provides a low rate of postoperative complications and satisfactory fertility outcomes.
