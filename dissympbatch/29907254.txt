  Opisthorchiasis is a neglected tropical disease , caused by infection with the fish-borne trematode Opisthorchis viverrini sensu lato that afflicts more than 10million people in Southeast Asia , including Thailand , Lao PDR , Vietnam and Cambodia. The disease is characterized by a chronic<disease> infection<disease> that induces hepatobiliary inflammation<symptom> , especially periductal fibrosis<disease> , which can be detected by ultrasonography. This chronic inflammation<symptom> eventually leads to cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA) , a usually fatal bile duct cancer that develops in approximately 1 % of O. viverrini-infected individuals. In Thailand alone , CCA kills up to 20,000 people every year and is therefore of substantial public health importance. Its socioeconomic impacts on impoverished families and communities are considerable. To reduce O. viverrini-associated morbidity and CCA , the primary intervention measures focus on opisthorchiasis control and elimination. Accurate diagnoses of O. viverrini infection , in both mammalian , snail and fish intermediate hosts , are important for achieving these goals. Despite extensive efforts over several decades to find sensitive and specific diagnostics for opisthorchiasis , a simple and robust diagnostic method is still required. Here we review earlier and current developments in the search for new diagnostics for opisthorchiasis , with practical applications in the research laboratory , the clinic and the field. Of the methods currently available , the urine antigen assay shows considerable potential for the diagnosis and screening of opisthorchiasis. Nevertheless , these new assays require validation , determination of their cost-effectiveness when applied for mass screening in an endemic setting in support of policy decisions for national public health programs aimed at the control and elimination of opisthorchiasis.
