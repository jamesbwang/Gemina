  To elucidate the clinico-laboratory characteristics associated with pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus ( pSLE) patients with higher Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index ( SLEDAI) score in a retrospective cohort of pSLE patients. A retrospective study involving 32 pSLE patients was conducted at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia , Kelantan , Malaysia between 2006 and 2017. Within the group of 32 pSLE patients , 23 were girls and 9 were boys ( 3:1 ratio). The most common symptom was renal disorder ( n = 21; 65.6 %) followed by malar rash<symptom> ( n = 9; 28.1 %) , oral ulcers<disease> ( n = 7; 21.9 %) , prolonged fever<disease> ( n = 5; 15.6 %) and arthritis<disease> ( n = 4; 12.5 %). Antinuclear antibodies ( ANA) were detected in all patients and 25 patients ( 78.1 %) were positive for anti-double stranded DNA ( anti-dsDNA) antibodies. Eighteen ( 56.3 %) patients had active SLE ( SLEDAI â‰¥ 6) , and these patients were significantly associated with heavy pyuria ( p = 0.004) , a high ANA concentration ( 1:160; p = 0.040 , 1:320; p = 0.006) , elevated ESR ( p = 0.006) , low C3 levels ( p = 0.008) , oral ulcers<disease> ( p = 0.010) , heavy hematuria<symptom> ( p = 0.017) and heavy proteinuria<symptom> ( p = 0.017) , lupus erythematosus ( LE)- nonspecific lesion<symptom> manifestations ( p = 0.019) and malar rash<symptom> ( p = 0.044). Pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus patients with higher SLEDAI score were most significantly associated with pyuria , high ANA titers , and elevated ESR.
