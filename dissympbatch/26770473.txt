  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) is intrahepatic ectopic lipid deposition which is present despite a lack of other causes of secondary hepatic fat accumulation. It is the most common chronic liver disorder in the welldeveloped countries. NAFLD is a multidisciplinary disease that affects various systems and organs and is inextricably linked to simple obesity , metabolic syndrome<disease> , insulin resistance and overt diabetes mellitus type 2. The positive energy balance<symptom> related to obesity leads to a variety of systemic changes including modified levels of insulin , insulin- like growth factor-1 , adipokines , hepatokines and cytokines. It is strongly linked to carcinogenesis and new evidence proves that NAFLD is associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality among cancer survivors. This article focuses on the association between NAFLD and extrahepatic gastrointestinal tract cancers , aiming to shed light on the pathomechanism of changes leading to the development of tumors.
