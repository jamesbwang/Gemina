  Review how the various surgical treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> and lower urinary tract symptoms impact on male sexual health and function. The interplay between benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> and erectile function is complex , and the conditions seem linked. Most cavitating procedures to improve male voiding will degrade ejaculatory and possibly erectile function. Many of the newer minimally invasive therapies appear to preserve sexual function in the short term while sacrificing some of the voiding improvements realized with more complete removal of the prostate adenoma. Benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> will affect the majority of men at some point in life , and surgical treatment remains an integral option for managing the associated urinary<symptom> symptoms<symptom>. These treatments are associated with variable rates of sexual side effects , including ejaculatory , erectile , and orgasmic dysfunction. As the impact of these treatment modalities on sexual dysfunction has become more widely acknowledged , there has been a rise in interest in modalities that minimize adverse sexual side effects. Recent studies have sought to further elucidate the relationship between surgical treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia<disease> and sexual outcomes , and a number of studies have demonstrated that treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia<disease> can actually result in improved sexual function for some patients. This work intends to review the proposed pathophysiology behind the sexual side effects resulting from the surgical treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia<disease> and review the literature regarding both established and emerging surgical techniques.
