  The aim of this study was to assess disease characteristics , autoantibodies , and disease activity in granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( GPA) patients with ocular manifestations. The cohort included 46 GPA patients visiting the ophthalmology clinic. Ocular manifestations were recorded , clinical and slit lamp examinations were performed. The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score ( BVAS) was recorded. Laboratory investigations and the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( ANCA) assay were performed. Median age of the 22 male and 24 female patients was 44.5 ( 32-63) years , median disease duration 6.5 ( 1-16) years. Ocular manifestations were present in all patients: 12 ( 26.1 %) had proptosis; 40 ( 87 %) had scleritis/episcleritis , with perforation in 3 ( 6.5 %); 33 ( 71.7 %) had keratoconjunctivitis ( KC) , with acute infiltrative stromal keratitis<disease> in 11 , peripheral ulcerative keratitis<disease> in 15 , and sclerosing keratitis<disease> in 11 patients. Uveitis was present in 11 ( 23.9 %) and retinal changes including vasculitis , exudates , and hemorrhage<symptom> were present in 7 ( 15.2 %). Blurred vision was present in 43 ( 93.5 %) patients and 2 ( 4.3 %) had vision loss<symptom>. Glaucoma was present in 4 ( 8.7 %) and hypotony in 2 ( 4.3 %) patients. Involvement was bilateral in 32 ( 69.6 %) patients. Rheumatoid factor ( RF) was positive in 56.5 % and significantly associated with uveitis ( p = 0.04) , while antinuclear antibody ( ANA) was positive in 45.7 % and significantly associated with KC ( p = 0.04). BVAS tended to be higher in patients with uveitis ( p = 0.49). Ocular involvement must be considered in all GPA patients and referral to an experienced ophthalmologist is mandatory for proper management and improved outcome of such a rare systemic<disease> disease<disease>. ANA and RF positivity may raise suspicion for KC or uveitis , respectively. There was a remarkable association between uveitis and disease activity.
