  A woman underwent surgical intervention for a carcinoma of the ovary. In the intervention , a submucosal nodule<disease> of the ileum was found. Pathological study revealed a spindle cell lipoma ( SCL). This case revealed the presence of CD34-positive spindle and stellate cells with dendritic cytoplasmic prolongations , a feature shared with dendritic fibromyxolipoma. Fluorescence in <i> <i> <i> in situ </i> </i> </i> hybridisation analysis showed 13q14 heterozygous deletion. Spindle cell lipoma of the small intestine has not been previously reported. Spindle cell lipoma , although rare , should be included among the benign mesenchymal lesions<symptom> of the small intestine. This report extends the range of locations in which this tumour is found to arise.
