  Cochlear implants ( CIs) are being implanted in people with unilateral hearing loss because they can improve speech intelligibility and sound source localization. Though designed to restore the afferent auditory stimulation , the CI possibly restores some efferent effects. The present study aimed at investigating this possibility. Five single-sided deaf CI users with less than 30 dB hearing loss up to 4 kHz in their acoustic ear participated in the study. Absolute thresholds for their acoustic ears<disease> were measured for pure tones<symptom> of 500 and 4000 Hz with durations of 10 and 200 ms in the presence and in the absence of contralateral broadband electrical stimulation ( CBES) delivered with the CI. The electrical stimulus consisted of pulse trains ( symmetric biphasic pulses with phase duration 36 Î¼s) on all 16 electrodes sequentially stimulated at a rate of 843 Hz. Its intensity was set to sound as loud as broadband noise at 50 or 60 dB SPL in the acoustic ear. Thresholds were measured using a three-interval , three-alternative , forced-choice procedure with a two-down , one-up adaptive rule to estimate the level for 71 % correct in the psychometric function. Thresholds measured without the CBES were lower for the longer than for the shorter tones<symptom> , and the difference was larger at 500 than at 4000 Hz. CBES equivalent to 50 or 60 dB SPL caused significant threshold elevation only for short ( 10 ms) and low frequency ( 500 Hz) acoustic tones<symptom> of 1.2 and 2.2 dB. These increases appear smaller than previously reported for normal hearing listeners in related experiments. These results support the notion that for single-sided deaf CI users , the CI modulates hearing in the acoustic ear. The possible mechanisms that may be contributing this effect are discussed.
