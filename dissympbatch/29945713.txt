  Pyoderma gangrenosum ( PG) is a rare neutrophil-mediated autoinflammatory dermatosis that can involve the oral mucosa. Dental surgery is a potential triggering factor for the onset of PG lesions<symptom>. The authors describe and discuss the dental management of a rare case of aggressive periodontitis<disease> in a patient with PG , from multiple tooth extractions to prosthetic rehabilitation , including administration of systemic steroid prophylaxis before surgery to prevent the potential onset of PG-related lesions<symptom>. A 22-year-old man who had a diagnosis of PG and who had aggressive periodontal<disease> disease<disease> underwent dental extractions , gingivoplastic surgery , and prosthetic rehabilitation. The patient received 8 milligrams of betamethasone intramuscularly 20 minutes before the oral surgery. The tissues healed perfectly , and no adverse effects were reported. For minor oral surgery , prophylactic corticosteroids might help reduce the risk of developing PG-related lesions<symptom>. The clinician should plan the prosthetic devices to be as atraumatic as possible.
