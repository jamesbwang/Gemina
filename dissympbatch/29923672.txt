  This retrospective study included 1051 patients with end-stage kidney disease and Brescia-Cimino arteriovenous fistula<disease> ( AVF) ( excluding pre-dialysis patients) , and aimed to investigate the role of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in AVF primary failure. Systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( DBP) were measured twice daily for 3 days before surgery. The success ( N = 1010) and failure ( N = 41) groups were based on AVF primary failure within 7 days of surgery. The cephalic vein was larger and the preoperative mean arterial pressure ( MAP) was higher in the success group compared with the failure group ( P < 0.05). Cephalic vein diameter and preoperative MAP independently predicted AVF primary failure within 7 days after surgery. In conclusion , small cephalic vein diameter and low preoperative MAP were associated with AVF primary failure within 7 days of surgery.
