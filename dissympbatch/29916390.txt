  Microsporidial spores were identified in the musculature of a loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta found dead on the shore in New Brunswick , Canada. Gastroenteritis<disease> was diagnosed on gross postmortem examination , with no gross abnormalities detected in the skeletal muscle. Histologically , the microsporidial spores were associated with inflammation<symptom> and muscular necrosis<symptom> and measured 1.1-1.7 × 2.2-3.4 µm. Spores were typically identified within sporophorous vesicles and , less often , in sporophorocysts and were weakly Gram positive , had punctate PAS staining , and were occasionally strongly acid-fast. Ultrastructural characteristics included 7-10 polar filament coils and other standard features of microsporidial spores. PCR for the microsporidial small subunit rRNA gene sequence was performed on DNA extracted from the muscle and small intestine , and the resulting amplicon was sequenced and queried against published microsporidial genomes. DNA sequences shared 98.2-99.8 % sequence identity to Clade III of the Marinosporidia. This is the first report of a microsporidial infection contributing to the mortality of a sea turtle.
