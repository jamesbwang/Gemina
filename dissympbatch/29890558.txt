  Nocardiosis<disease> is a rare infection caused by ubiquitous soil-born , acid-resistant , Gram-positive bacteria that can be life-threatening in immunocompromised patients. Originally usually diagnosed in HIV-positive patients , only few cases have been reported in patients on immunosuppressive therapy for inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatologic disorders. We present a case of a 32-year-old man who was treated with infliximab , prednisolone , and azathioprine for severe terminal<symptom> ileitis<symptom>. Although the clinical status improved under triple immunosuppressive therapy , weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , weakness<symptom> , and fatigue<symptom> persisted. Laboratory studies revealed iron deficiency anemia<symptom> , hypalbuminemia and raised inflammatory markers. Chest computed tomography scan showed multiple pulmonary nodules<symptom> and a large cavity in the left upper lobe ( segment 3a). Empiric tuberculostatic therapy was introduced for suspected miliary tuberculosis<disease> but stopped for lack of clinical improvement and negative tuberculosis<disease> tests ( interferon-gamma release assay , microscopy , polymerase chain reaction). Finally , the diagnosis of pulmonary<disease> nocardiosis<disease> with concomitant pulmonary
