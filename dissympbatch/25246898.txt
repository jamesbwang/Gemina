  Polycystic ovary syndrome<disease> ( PCOS) is a common form of the endocrine disease which is associated with metabolic dysfunction. PCOS and type 2 diabetes mellitus are related in multiple aspects and are similar in many pathological features. Anti-diabetic effects of The aim of current study was to evaluate the effects of thymoquinone , the main components of Intraperitoneal injection of estradiol valerate for 25 days was used to induce PCOS in Wistar rats , followed by intraperitoneal administration of 8 and 16 mg/kg thymoquinone for 30 days. Rats were divided into 5 groups; control , sham or PCOS , experiment-1 ( PCOS and 8 mg/kg thymoquinone) , experiment-2 ( PCOS and 16 mg/kg thymoquinone) , and metformin ( PCOS and metformin administration , 100 mg/kg) groups. All of the animals were subjected to serum biochemical analysis of blood and histopathological study of ovaries. Estradiol valerate induced PCOS while administration of thymoquinone recovered it. The body<symptom> weight , ovarian morphology , and ovulation had been improved and the serum biochemical parameters including glucose , triglyceride , total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein , high-density lipoprotein , luteinizing hormone , and follicle stimulating hormone were reversed after thymoquinone intervention. Our data suggest that thymoquinone has improvement effects on an ovarian function and ovulation in the PCOS rat model. Therefore , thymoquinone and
