  Cross-sectional psychometrics study. To determine the construct validity and internal consistency of the revised Skin Management Needs Assessment Checklist ( revised SMnac). Six spinal cord rehabilitation centers. One-hundred and thirty-two community-dwelling individuals with spinal cord injury ( SCI) were included. Construct validity was assessed by a Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient between the revised SMnac and several questionnaires: Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale , Ways of Coping Questionnaire , Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale ( HADS) , Braden scale; or clinical variables: educational level , presence of a pressure ulcer<disease> ( PU) , history of multiple PUs , time since injury , and pain. The study evidenced construct validity with a fair to moderate correlation coefficient between the revised SMnac and Rosenberg scale ( r These results show that the revised SMnac is a valid tool to assess PU self-management in individuals with SCI. Further studies are needed to assess the revised SMnac 's responsiveness to change.
