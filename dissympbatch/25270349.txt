  Primary lymphomas in the choroid plexus are much less frequent than primary lymphomas in the brain parenchyma. A 66-year-old male patient was referred to our department with a right intraventricular mass that had been diagnosed by biopsy at another hospital as anaplastic ependymoma. The patient underwent subtotal removal of the tumor via a transcortical inferior temporal gyrus approach. The mass was attached to the choroid plexus in the right atrium. Histopathological examination showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Ophthalmological examination , blood tests , computed tomography of the whole body , and bone<disease> marrow biopsy did not show any other lesion<symptom> , leading to the diagnosis of primary choroid plexus lymphoma. The patient underwent chemotherapy with three courses of high-dose methotrexate and one course of carboplatin and etoposide followed by whole-brain irradiation ( 1.8 Gy Ã— 22). We present a rare case of primary choroid plexus lymphoma , which should be considered in the differential diagnosis of choroid plexus tumors.
