  Lupus erythematosus profundus ( LEP) is a variant of lupus erythematosus , involving the deep dermis and subcutaneous fat. LEP is characterized by the presence of lymphoid follicles ( LF) and germinal centers ( GC). However , it remains unknown whether these lymphoid structures correspond to the lymphoid tissues such as cutaneous tertiary lymphoid organs ( TLO). Previously , we identified dynamically orchestrated cellular elements in murine contact dermatitis<disease> that resembled lymphoid structures , which we termed inducible skin-associated lymphoid tissues ( iSALT). We subsequently reported structures analogous to iSALT in human secondary syphilis<disease> , suggesting that iSALT can also exist in humans. Here , we studied ectopic lymphoid tissues in the lesions<symptom> of LEP by immunohistochemistry and compared their characteristics with those of TLO. We demonstrated that LF of LEP were composed of B-cell follicles intermingled with CXCL13-expressing cells , distinct aggregations of T cells , and some blood vessels expressing peripheral node addressin. These findings indicate that LF of LEP can be considered as a type of iSALT.
