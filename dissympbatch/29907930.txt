  Obesity is associated with periodontitis<disease> , but the mechanisms underlying this association have yet to be unraveled. The present investigation was to evaluate a common rat model , in which obesity is induced by high-fat , high-sucrose diet ( HFSD) , for its applicability in periodontal research. Ten male Wistar rats were fed a 3-month HFSD along with a matching control group. Afterwards , the body<symptom> weight , adipocyte morphology , leptin and adiponectin levels in adipose tissue , gingiva , and serum as well as the serum levels of triglyceride , cholesterol , and glucose were analyzed. For statistical analyses , parametric and non-parametric tests were applied ( p < 0.05). Body<symptom> weight was significantly higher in the HFSD group after dieting as compared to control. HFSD caused a significant increase in serum triglyceride , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and leptin levels and a significant decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Furthermore , adipose tissue from HFSD rats exhibited significantly larger adipocytes , displayed a significant upregulation of leptin and , surprisingly , elevated adiponectin levels , which is in contrast to chronic obesity in humans. Although leptin and adiponectin were also observed in gingival biopsies , no obvious differences between the groups were found. Although this rat diet-induced obesity model is characterized by changes typical of obesity , it also has limitations , which have to be considered when data , especially with regard to adipokines , are extrapolated to humans. The rodent diet-induced obesity model may be useful for unraveling pathomechanisms underlying the association between obesity and periodontal destruction but conclusions have to be drawn with caution.
