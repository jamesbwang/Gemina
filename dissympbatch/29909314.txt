  Trichothecene mycotoxins commonly contaminate cereal grains and are often linked to human and animal food<disease> poisoning<disease> The rapid onset of anorexia<symptom> is a common hallmark of trichothecenes-induced toxicity. Although the neurotransmitters 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT) and substance P ( SP) are known to regulate appetite<symptom> , it remains unknown whether these two neurotransmitters are involved in type A trichothecenes-induced anorectic response. The goal of this study is to relate plasma 5-HT and SP to anorectic responses induced by type A trichothecenes T-2 toxin ( T-2) , HT-2 toxin ( HT-2) , diacetoxyscirpenol ( DAS) and neosolaniol ( NEO). These four toxins evoked robust anorectic response and secretion of plasma 5-HT and SP at 1 mg/kg bw. Following oral exposure , plasma 5-HT and SP were elevated and all peaked at 2 h for T-2 , HT-2 , DAS and NEO. Following intraperitoneal ( IP) administration , plasma 5-HT and SP were peaked at 6 h , 6 h , 2 h , 2 h and 2 h , 6 h , 2 h , 2 h for T-2 , HT-2 , DAS and NEO , respectively. Elevations of plasma 5-HT and SP markedly corresponded to anorexia<symptom> induction by T-2 , HT-2 , DAS and NEO. Altogether , the results presented herein indicated that 5-HT and SP play contributory roles in anorectic responses induced by T-2 , HT-2 , DAS and NEO.
