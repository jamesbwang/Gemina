  Mirror syndrome<disease> ( MS) is characterized by the combination of maternal generalized edema<symptom> , fetal hydrops and placental hypertrophy. A shift of the serum placenta-derived angiogenic factor like sFlt-1 in MS is similar to that in pre-eclampsia ( PE). We experienced a MS case caused by cardiac myopathy in the fetus with normal cardiac structure. A 27-year-old primiparous woman at 28 weeks of gestation had systemic edema<symptom> without hypertension and proteinuria<symptom>. Her symptoms rapidly disappeared after delivery. Compared with previously reported MS cases with maternal hypertension or proteinuria<symptom> , the serum sFlt-1 level was lower in our case. Severity of maternal symptoms in MS might be paralleled with the serum sFlt-1 level. Additionally , serum hCG level in MS is much higher than that in PE. Maternal edema<symptom> rather than hypertension and proteinuria<symptom> can be more remarkable in MS compared with PE. It can be potentially explained by increased serum hCG level.
