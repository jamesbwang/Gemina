  Research on adverse events ( AEs) in outpatient surgery has been limited. As part of a Veterans Health Administration ( VA) project on AE surveillance , we chart-reviewed selected outpatient surgical cases to characterize the nature and severity of AEs. We abstracted financial year 2012-2015 VA outpatient surgery cases selected with high ( n = 1185) and low ( n = 1072) likelihood of an AE based on postoperative health care utilization. The abstraction tool included established AE definitions and validated harm and severity scales. We found AEs in 608 high-likelihood ( 51 %) and 126 low-likelihood outpatient surgical procedures ( 12 %). Among 1010 unique AEs , the most common were wound issues ( n = 261 , 26 %) , urinary<symptom> retention<symptom> ( 23 %) , and urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> ( 12 %). While 63 % of all AEs involved minimal harm , 28 % required hospitalization , and 9 % were severely harmful including 8 AEs requiring intervention to sustain life and 2 deaths. Overall , 102 AEs ( 10 %) required , at minimum , a repeat surgery to treat. Among VA outpatient surgical procedures selected based on likelihood of an AE , nearly 40 % of identified events carried more than minimal patient harm , undermining the claim that outpatient surgery is relatively safe. Prevalent and preventable AEs such as wound<disease> dehiscence and urinary<symptom> retention<symptom> may be useful targets for quality improvement.
