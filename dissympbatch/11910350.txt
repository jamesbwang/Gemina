  Severe acute pancreatitis<disease> is a lethal inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> frequently accompanied by pancreatic necrosis<symptom>. We aimed to identify a key regulator in the development of pancreatic necrosis<symptom>. A cytokine/chemokine array using sera from patients with acute pancreatitis<disease> ( AP) revealed that serum CXCL16 levels were elevated according to the severity of pancreatitis<disease> In a mouse model of AP , Cxcl16 expression was induced in pancreatic acini in the late phase with the development of pancreatic necrosis<symptom>. Cxcl16
