  Prospective data regarding the role of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD) for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with long QT syndrome<disease> ( LQTS) is scarce. Herein , we explore the prospective Rochester LQTS ICD registry to assess the risk for appropriate shock<symptom> in primary prevention in a real-world setting. We studied 212 LQTS patients that had ICD implantation for primary prevention. Best-subsets proportional-hazards regression analysis was used to identify clinical variables that were associated with the first appropriate shock<symptom>. Conditional models of Prentice , Williams , and Peterson were utilized for the analysis of recurrent appropriate shocks<disease>. During a median follow-up of 9.2 ± 4.9 years , there were 42 patients who experienced at least one appropriate shock<symptom> and the cumulative probability of appropriate shock<symptom> at 8 years was 22 %. QTc ≥ 550 ms ( hazard ratio ( HR) 3.94 , confidence interval ( CI) 2.08-7.46; P < 0.001) and prior syncope on β-blockers ( HR 1.92 , CI 1.01-3.65; P = 0.047) were associated with increased risk of appropriate shock<symptom>. History of syncope while on β-blocker treatment ( HR 1.87 , CI 1.28-2.72; P = 0.001) , QTc 500-549 ms ( HR 1.68 , CI 1.10-2.81; P = 0.048) , and QTc ≥ 550 ms ( HR 3.66 , CI 2.34-5.72; P < 0.001) were associated with increased risk for recurrent appropriate shocks<disease> , while β-blockers were not protective ( HR 1.03 , CI 0.63-1.68 , P = 0.917). LQT2 ( HR 2.10 , CI 1.22-3.61; P = 0.008) and multiple mutations ( HR 2.87 , CI 1.49-5.53; P = 0.002) were associated with higher risk for recurrent shocks<disease> as compared with LQT1. In this prospective ICD registry , we identified clinical and genetic variables that were associated appropriate shock<symptom> risk. These data can be used for risk stratification in high-risk patients evaluated for primary prevention with ICD.
