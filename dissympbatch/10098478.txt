  Pelvic<disease> inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> is an infection of the upper genital tract , including the uterus , ovaries , uterine tubes , and pelvic peritoneum. Tubo-ovarian abscess<disease> and pyosalpinx are common complications associated with pelvic<disease> inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> They are usually encountered in sexually active women , but rare cases in Virgos have also been described. Here , we report the case of a 50-year-old Virgo woman presenting with pyosalpinx secondary to previous laparotomic sigmoidectomy for acute diverticulitis. Inflammation<symptom> caused by the woman 's diverticulitis and laparotomic surgery could have been the origin of her left uterine tube occlusion and consequent hydrosalpinx development. The contact between the rectum and left uterine tube observed in our patient suggests that superinfection of the hydrosalpinx could have occurred secondary to bacterial translocation. The patient 's condition was managed with laparoscopic left salpingectomy and antibiotic therapy , which resulted in complete resolution. Regardless of sexual history , pelvic<disease> inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> should be considered in all women with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> Diagnosing pelvic<disease> inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> in Virgos could be very challenging , but its recognition and appropriate treatment are indispensable because of the potential long-term complications.
