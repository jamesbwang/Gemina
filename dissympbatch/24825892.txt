  The apical inflammatory cytokine TNF regulates numerous important biological processes including inflammation<symptom> and cell death , and drives inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>. TNF secretion requires TACE ( also called ADAM17) , which cleaves TNF from its transmembrane tether. The trafficking of TACE to the cell surface , and stimulation of its proteolytic activity , depends on membrane proteins , called iRhoms. To delineate how the TNF/TACE/iRhom axis is regulated , we performed an immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry screen to identify iRhom-binding proteins. This identified a novel protein , that we name iTAP ( iRhom Tail-Associated Protein) that binds to iRhoms , enhancing the cell surface stability of iRhoms and TACE , preventing their degradation in lysosomes. Depleting iTAP in primary human macrophages profoundly impaired TNF production and tissues from iTAP KO mice exhibit a pronounced depletion in active TACE levels. Our work identifies iTAP as a physiological regulator of TNF signalling and a novel target for the control of
