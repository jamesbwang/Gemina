  Antiphospholipid syndrome<disease> ( APS) is a condition in which the presence of antibodies against phospholipid-binding proteins is associated with thrombophilia and/or pregnancy morbidity. Although antiphospholipid antibodies have anticoagulant characteristics in vitro , they are associated with thromboembolic complications. Thrombin generation ( TG) is a sensitive global test of coagulation , and elevated TG is associated with thrombosis. Increased TG can be caused by increased prothrombin conversion , decreased thrombin inactivation , or a combination of both. In this study , we measured TG in APS patients and healthy controls with and without vitamin K antagonist ( VKA) treatment at 1 and 5 pM tissue factor and with thrombomodulin. Prothrombin conversion and thrombin inactivation were determined by thrombin dynamics analysis. The TG peak was increased in nontreated APS patients at 1 pM TF compared with nontreated controls. Prothrombin conversion was significantly increased in nontreated APS patients. In contrast , prothrombin conversion did not differ in controls and patients that were on VKA therapy. Thrombin inactivation was comparable between controls and APS patients in the presence and absence of VKAs. Both TG ( peak and ETP) and prothrombin conversion were significantly higher in APS patients with prior thrombosis compared with patients without a history of thrombosis. In this study , we demonstrate that in APS , the hemostatic balance<symptom> shifts toward a more prothrombotic phenotype due to elevated prothrombin conversion but unchanged thrombin inactivation rates. Within the group of APS patients , increased TG and prothrombin conversion are associated with a history of thrombosis.
