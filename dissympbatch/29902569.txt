  Inflammatory disorders such as sepsis<disease> are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Mitochondrial dysfunction is considered a key factor in the pathogenesis of severe<symptom> inflammation<symptom>. In the present study , we aimed to investigate the impact of arachidonic acid , omega-3 ( n-3) fatty acids , and n-3-derived lipid mediators 18R-HEPE and resolvin ( Rv) E1 on mitochondrial function in experimental inflammation<symptom>. The results revealed that , in contrast to n-6 and n-3 fatty acids , both 18R-HEPE and RvE1 possess anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. Both mediators are able to restore inflammation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction , which is characterized by a decrease in mitochondrial respiration<symptom> and membrane potential , as well as an imbalance of mitochondrial fission and fusion. Furthermore , inhibition of mitochondrial fission by Mdivi-1 and Dynasore reduces levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. These results suggest a novel functional mechanism for the beneficial effects of RvE1 in inflammatory reactions.
