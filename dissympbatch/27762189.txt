  To explore the mechanism of the different clinical efficacies of mesenchymal stem cell transplantation ( MSCT) and identify a possible serum biomarker for predicting the therapeutic effect of MSCT in rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) patients. A total of 105 patients with persistently active RA and poor<symptom> responses<symptom> to traditional medication were randomly divided into MSCT and control groups. Outcomes were evaluated according to the 28-joint Disease Activity Score and Health Assessment Questionnaire , serological indicators , regulatory T cell ( Treg) to T helper 17 ( Th17) cell ratio , and inflammatory cytokine levels. Twelve weeks after MSCT , the outcomes of the MSCT group were evaluated according to the European League against Rheumatism response criteria. Patients with a good or moderate response were added to the response group , and those with no response were added to the no-response group. No serious adverse events were reported for either MSCT subgroup ( 28 in the response group and 24 in the no-response group). The therapeutic effects lasted for 48 weeks without continuous administration. Notably , a transient increase in serum IFN-γ ( > 2 pg/ml) levels was observed in the response group , but not in the no-response group. Furthermore , an increase in IL-10 levels and the Treg/Th17 ratio and a reduction in IL-6 levels appeared 2-3 weeks after the transient IFN-γ increase. Allogeneic MSCT is safe and feasible , and we propose high serum IFN-γ levels as a potent biomarker for predicting MSCT response. Trial registration chictr.org , ChiCTR-ONC-16008770.
