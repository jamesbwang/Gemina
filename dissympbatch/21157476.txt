  Severe intracranial stenosis might lead to acute cerebral ischemia. It is imperative to better assess patients who may benefit from immediate reperfusion and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> management to prevent injury to peri-infarct tissue. We assessed cerebral autoregulation using static and dynamic methods in an 81-year-old woman suffering acute cerebral ischemia from severe intracranial stenosis in the petrous segment of the left internal carotid artery ( LICA). Static cerebral autoregulation , which is evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance perfusion studies showed a progression of infarcts and a large perfusion-diffusion mismatch in the entire LICA territory between the second and third days after onset despite maximized medical therapy. Dynamic methods , including transfer function analysis and mean velocity index , demonstrated an increasingly impaired dynamic cerebral autoregulation ( DCA) on the affected side between these days. Revascularization through acute intracranial stenting resulted in improved perfusion in the LICA territory and normalization of both dynamic and static cerebral autoregulation. Thus , DCA , a noninvasive bedside method , may be useful in helping to identify and select patients with large-vessel flow-failure syndromes<disease> that would benefit from immediate revascularization of intracranial atherosclerotic disease.
