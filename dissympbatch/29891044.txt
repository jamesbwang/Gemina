  Cytomegalovirus ( CMV) infection is a common infectious complication in immunocompromised patients. The colon is the most common site of CMV infection in the gastrointestinal tract. Rarely , however , invasion of the upper gastrointestinal tract , such as the esophagus or stomach , has been reported. Herein , we describe the first reported case of CMV gastritis<disease> in a patient with end-stage renal disease and uremic symptoms ( including nausea<symptom> , vomiting , and poor appetite<symptom>) who had begun hemodialysis therapy. This patient was not a transplant recipient and was not receiving immunosuppressant treatment. As CMV gastritis<disease> is easily over looked in patients with end-stage renal disease , physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion and establish the diagnosis as early as possible using an upper GI endoscopic biopsy and adequate staining.
