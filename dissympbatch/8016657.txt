  Differentiation of blood cells is one of the most complex processes in the body. It is regulated by the action of transcription factors in time and space which creates a specific signaling network. In the hematopoietic signaling system , Notch is one of the main regulators of lymphocyte<symptom> development. The aim of this study was to get insight into the regulation of Notch signalization and the influence of poly ( ADP-ribose) polymerase ( PARP) activity on this process in three leukemia<disease> cell lines obtained from B and T cells. PARP1 is an enzyme involved in posttranslational protein modification and chromatin structure changes. B and T leukemia<disease> cells were treated with Notch and PARP inhibitors , alone or in combination , for a prolonged period. The cells did not show cell proliferation arrest or apoptosis. Analysis of gene and protein expression set involved in Notch and PARP pathways revealed increase in
