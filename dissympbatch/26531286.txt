  Nonvitamin K oral anticoagulants ( NOACs) sometimes cause hemorrhage<symptom> , and the gastrointestinal tract is a common site of involvement. However , clinical characteristics of gastrointestinal bleeding ( GIB) during NOAC therapy have not been fully elucidated. We studied 658 patients who were prescribed dabigatran , rivaroxaban , or apixaban between April 2011 and November 2015. Medical charts were reviewed to examine whether clinically relevant bleeding ( Bleeding Academic Research Consortium criteria type 2 or greater) developed. The incidence of GIB was 2.0 %/ year , and one-third was from the upper GI. Among all hemorrhagic events , GIB was the most common cause. The extent of bleeding from the GI tract , particularly the upper GI tract , was more serious than bleeding from the other site. Multiple regression analysis showed that both past digestive ulcer<disease> and absence of concomitant proton pump inhibitors were significantly associated with the incidence of upper GIB , while concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , dual antiplatelets , and past GIB were significant factors regarding lower GIB. GIB was common and serious in patients taking NOACs. Upper<symptom> GIB tended to become more serious than lower GIB. Proton pump inhibitors seem to be key drugs for preventing upper GIB during NOAC therapy.
