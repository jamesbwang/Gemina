  This study identifies and ranks predictors of cardiovascular health at the neighborhood level in the United States. We merged the 500 Cities Data and the 2011-2015 American Community Survey to create a new data set that includes sociodemographic characteristics , health behaviors , prevention measures , and cardiovascular health outcomes for more than 28 000 census tracts in the United States. We used random forest<disease> to rank predictors of coronary heart disease and stroke. For coronary heart disease , the top 5 ordered predictors were the prevalence of taking medicine for high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control , binge drinking , being aged 65 years or older , lack of leisure-time physical activity , and obesity. For stroke , the top 5 ordered predictors were the prevalence of obesity , lack of leisure-time physical activity , taking medicine for high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , being black , and binge drinking. Machine learning approaches have the potential to inform policy makers on important resource allocation decisions at the neighborhood level.
