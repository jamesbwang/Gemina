  Graphene-related materials ( GRMs) such as graphene oxide ( GO) and few-layer graphene ( FLG) are used in multiple biomedical applications; however , there is still insufficient information available regarding their interactions with the main biological barriers such as skin. In this study , we explored the effects of GO and FLG on HaCaTs human skin keratinocytes , using NMR-based metabolomics and fluorescence microscopy to evaluate the global impact of each GRM on cell fate and damage. GO and FLG at low concentrations ( 5 Î¼g mL-1) induced a differential remodeling of the metabolome , preceded by an increase in the level of radical oxygen species ( ROS) and free cytosolic Ca2 +. These changes are linked to a concentration-dependent increase in cell death by triggering apoptosis and necrosis<symptom> , the latter being predominant at higher concentrations of the nanostructures. In addition , both compounds reduce the ability of HaCaT cells to heal wounds<disease> Our results demonstrate that the GO and FLG used in this study , which mainly differ in their oxidation state , slightly trigger differential effects on HaCaTs cells , but with evident outcomes at the cellular and molecular levels. Their behavior as pro-apoptotic/necrotic substances and their ability to inhibit cell migration , even at low doses , should be considered in the development of future applications.
