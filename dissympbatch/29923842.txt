  We reviewed the use of noninvasive ventilation ( NIV) versus high flow nasal cannula ( HFNC) oxygen in adult acute<disease> respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> ( ARF). We searched major databases and included randomized trials comparing at least NIV with HFNC or NIV+HFNC with NIV in ARF. Primary outcomes included intubation/re-intubation rates. Secondary outcomes were ICU mortality and morbidities. Five trials were included; three compared HFNC with NIV , one compared HFNC , NIV and oxygen whereas one compared HFNC+NIV with NIV. Patients had hypoxaemic ARF ( PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg). Heterogeneity prevented result pooling. Three and two studies had superiority and noninferiority design , respectively. Patients were postcardiothoracic surgery , mixed medical/surgical patients and those with pneumonia<disease> Two trials were conducted after extubation , two before intubation and one during intubation. Three trials reported intubation/re-intubation rates as the primary outcomes. The other two trials reported the lowest peripheral capillary oxygen saturation readings during bronchoscopy or intubation. In the former three trials , the odds ratio for intubation/re-intubation rates between HFNC versus the NIV group ranged from 0.80 ( 95 % confidence interval: 0.54-1.19) to 1.65 ( 95 % confidence interval: 0.96-2.84). In the latter two trials , only one reported a difference in the lowest peripheral capillary oxygen saturation between NIV+HFNC versus the NIV group during intubation ( 100 % ( interquartile range: 95-100) vs. 96 % ( interquartile range: 92-99); P = 0.029). The secondary outcomes included differences in ICU mortality and patient tolerability , favouring HFNC , were conflicting , but highlighted future research directions. These include patients with hypercapneic ARF , more severe hypoxaemia ( PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mmHg) , a superiority design , an oxygen arm and patient-centred outcomes.
