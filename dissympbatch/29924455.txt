  Immunoglobulin G4-related disease ( IgG4-RD) is an uncommon disorder that demonstrates characteristic clinicopathologic features including sclerosing lesions<symptom> with storiform fibrosis<disease> , increased IgG4 + plasma cells with an increased IgG4 +/ IgG + plasma cell ratio , obliterative phlebitis , and often an increased serum IgG4 level. This review summarizes the characteristic histopathologic and clinical features of IgG4-RD with detailed discussion of the histopathologic characteristics of the most commonly involved anatomic sites. We also present recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of IgG4-RD and discuss updates on the treatment , prognosis , and outcomes of this rare disease , including discussion of the possible association between IgG4-RD and malignancy.
