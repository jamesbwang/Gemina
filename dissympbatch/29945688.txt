  When a fire occurs , there is little time to escape. In less than 30 seconds , a fire can rage out of control , filling the area with heat and toxic thick smoke ( Purdue University Fire Department , 2017; http://www.purdue.edu/ehps/fire/fire-101.html.) In 2010 , following the successful evacuation of Maale Ha'Carmel Mental Health Center during a raging forest<disease> fire in the area , a comprehensive investigation was performed to evaluate the management of the evacuation process and to systematically elicit lessons learned from the incident. In 2016 , a forest<disease> fire erupted in the same geographic area that required the evacuation of Fliman Geriatric Rehabilitation Hospital , and methodical debriefing identified the strengths and weaknesses<symptom> of the evacuation process in that hospital. The lessons learned from the evacuation of these two health care facilities , which were at the focus of major fires in Israel in 2010 and in 2016 , are presented.
