  Waldenström 's macroglobulinemia is a rare B-cell lymphoma. The gold standard treatment for Waldenström 's macroglobulinemia is an anti-CD20 antibody ( rituximab) in combination with alkylating agents and dexamethasone. Treatment targeting the B-cell receptor such as ibrutinib ( but not idelalisib) is currently approved for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory Waldenström 's macroglobulinemia. We report a case of a 71-year-old white French man with Waldenström 's macroglobulinemia who presented with acute<symptom> renal<symptom> failure<symptom> and hyperviscosity syndrome<disease>. His Waldenström 's macroglobulinemia was refractory to first-line treatment with rituximab , cyclophosphamide , and dexamethasone. Because of his hemorrhagic<disease> syndrome<disease> and medical history of recent myocardial infarction , we decided to treat him with idelalisib 150 mg twice daily instead of ibrutinib. We observed a very quick improvement in the patient 's clinical status without need for dose adjustment. Our patient 's case provides the first evidence , to the best of our knowledge , that idelalisib may be an efficient treatment option for patients with Waldenström 's macroglobulinemia complicated by anuric renal<symptom> failure<symptom> and in whom ibrutinib is contraindicated.
