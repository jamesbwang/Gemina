  Arachnoid granulations are common incidentally detected small dural lesions<symptom> which are usually asymptomatic and follow cerebrospinal fluid density/signal intensity on CT/MRI. Such lesions<symptom> reaching a size of more than 1 cm are termed as giant arachnoid granulations ( GAGs<symptom>) which have been previously reported to cause venous hypertension and headaches<symptom>. We report a case of GAG involving the proximal half of the superior sagittal sinus in a 45-year-old male patient which was associated with left temporal thrombosed dural arteriovenous fistula<disease> ( AVF) whose thrombosed draining veins were seen converging towards the site of GAG. The patient presented with three episodes of generalised tonic-clonic seizures<symptom> and improved with conservative treatment. No reports of such association of GAG with AVF is available in the literature , and we believe it could have occurred due to venous hypertension induced by GAG.
