  Sitagliptin is an anti-diabetic medication within the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP4) inhibitor class used as a single agent or in combination therapy. It is a well-studied and well-tolerated medication with commonly reported adverse events of upper respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> , nasopharyngitis , headache<symptom> , and gastrointestinal ( GI) upset. Post-marketing reports have also identified associations with acute pancreatitis<disease> and joint<symptom> pain<symptom>. Here , we report a case of type II diabetes with chronic<symptom> headache<symptom> which resolved rapidly after discontinuation of sitagliptin. Our case demonstrates the need for continuous monitoring and post-marketing surveillance for drugs with tolerable side effect profile. Also , increasing patient and physician awareness of long-term side effects of these commonly used medications is essential for adequate patient safety and quality care.
