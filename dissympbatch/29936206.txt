  Although the ipsilateral inferior petrosal sinus ( IPS) is preferred for treatment of cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistulas<disease> ( CS-dAVFs) , this method is problematic if ipsilateral IPS is occluded. We describe our experience in treating CS-dAVFs with ipsilateral IPS occlusion via the ascending pharyngeal<symptom> artery ( APA). Between January 2013 and June 2017 , of 36 CS-dAVFs , 23 with ipsilateral IPS occlusion were identified. Clinical charts , procedural data , angiographic results , and follow-up data were retrospectively reviewed. Of 23 CS-dAVFs , 16 displayed a single or dominant feeding APA on cerebral angiography , of which 13 were treated via the APA initially. Fistulas<disease> were occluded successfully through the neuromeningeal trunk of the APA in 7 cases and through the superior pharyngeal branch of the APA in 3 cases. Glue leakage occurred in 2 cases via the superior pharyngeal branch of the APA , and superior pharyngeal branch rupture occurred during superselection of the microguidewire in 1 patient , who was treated by opening the occluded ipsilateral IPS. During the follow-up period , 12 of 13 patients had complete occlusion , and no cranial nerve palsy occurred. CS-dAVF with ipsilateral IPS occlusion can be treated via various methods. Embolization through the APA as an initial access is a reasonable choice.
