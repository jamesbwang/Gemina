  Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors are a rare type of soft-tissue tumor. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors are characterized by rearrangements involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene locus on 2p23. We report the case of a 67-year-old Chinese male who presented with dysuria and fever<disease> Magnetic resonance imaging showed an irregular prostatic mass with an isointense signal and obscure boundary. Histopathological evaluation showed that the mass consisted mainly of spindle-shaped cells. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed that the tumor cells were negative for anaplastic lymphoma kinase. Inflammatory myofibroblastic prostate tumors are rare lesions<symptom> with unclear etiology. The pathological diagnosis is very important.
