  Ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) is characterized by disruption of the mucosal intestinal barrier. MicroRNAs , single-stranded noncoding RNAs of approximately 22nt , are dysregulated in UC. MicroRNAs targeting thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP) , a cytokine involved in T-cell maturation and polarization , may be involved in regulating UC inflammation<symptom> and mucosal healing. Biopsy samples from non-UC ( n = 38) , inactive UC ( n = 18) , and active UC ( n = 23) patients were analyzed for mRNA ( real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction) or TSLP protein expression ( enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Flow cytometry was used to isolate CD4 + T cells from biopsies. The functional mechanism was shown using luciferase assays and antago-miR transfections. The TSLP/miR -31 association was analyzed on 196 subjects from a previous clinical trial that tested the anti-IL-13 drug tralokinumab , whereas mucosal healing effects were studied on a subset of patients ( n = 13) from this trial. We found that TSLP is reduced at both mRNA and protein levels in inflamed UC patients when compared with healthy subjects , in both whole biopsies and biopsy-isolated CD4 + CD25 + T cells. The expression of miR-31 , predicted to target TSLP , inversely co-related to the levels of TSLP mRNA in T cells. Blocking miR-31 in vitro in T cells increased both TSLP mRNA expression and protein secretion. Luciferase assays showed that miR-31 directly targeted TSLP mRNA , suggesting a direct mechanistic link. We also found that TSLP is increased in patients who achieve mucosal healing , comparing biopsies before and after treatment from the tralokinumab trial. Our data suggest a role for TSLP in promoting mucosal healing and regulating inflammation<symptom> in UC , whereas miR-31 can directly block this effect.
