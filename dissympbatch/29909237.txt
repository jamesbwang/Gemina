  Angiogenesis is a complex process describing the growth of new blood vessels from existing vasculature , and is triggered by local pro-angiogenic factors , such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) , which increase the metabolism of endothelial cells ( ECs). Angiogenesis takes part in various physiological conditions such as embryogenesis , placental growth , and in pathological conditions such as tumor growth , diabetic retinopathy , rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) and ischemic diseases. Current therapies against excessive angiogenesis target vascular growth signaling. However , tumors often counteract these therapies through adaptive mechanisms , thus novel alternative anti-angiogenic strategies are needed. Targeting metabolism is a new anti-angiogenic paradigm , especially through the inhibition of energy metabolism and glycosylation , with the perspective of maintaining the delicate balance<symptom> between the beneficial and deleterious effects of excessive angiogenesis in patients. Recent studies described a role for EC glycolysis and its main regulator 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/ fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 ( PFKFB3) in the regulation of angiogenesis , but only few studies are related to the role of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway during angiogenesis. Glycosylation allows the formation of glycoproteins , glycolipids and proteoglycans and impacts many pathways. The addition of glycans to N-linked proteins is catalyzed by the enzymatic activity of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases ( GnTs) , which regulates the glycosylation status of key angiogenic factors such as VEGF receptor 2 ( VEGFR2) and Notch. In addition , glycan-galectin ( Gal) interactions regulate vascular signaling programs and may contribute to tumor adaptations to anti-angiogenic strategies. Herein , we review novel pharmacological strategies targeting glycosylation , which could be used to decrease excessive angiogenesis in pathological conditions.
