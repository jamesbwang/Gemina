  Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) is a complex<disease> disease<disease> , almost as common in women as in men. Nonetheless , HF clinical presentation , prognosis , and aetiology vary by sex. This review summarizes the current state of sex-sensitive issues related to HF drugs included in treatment guidelines and suggests future directions for improved care. Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> presentation differs between female and male patients: females more often show with hypertensive aetiology and the preserved ejection fraction phenotype , while men more often show ischaemic aetiology and the reduced ejection fraction phenotype. Yet the HF clinical guidelines in Europe , the United States , and Canada do not reflect the sexual dimorphism. Further , in randomized clinical trials of HF medication , women are largely underrepresented , typically consisting of â‰¥ 70 % men. Given the knowledge that some adverse drug reactions , such as torsade de pointes and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough<symptom> , occur more frequently in women , we emphasize the need to test medications thoroughly in both sexes and explore sexual dimorphisms. To better represent all of the targeted patient population and provide better care for all , two kinds of change must come about: recruitment methods to randomized clinical trial samples need to evolve and the participation needs to seem more attractive to women.
