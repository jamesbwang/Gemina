  The deterioration of male reproductive health may represent an outcome of an active disease and environmental factors. The present study investigated the modulatory role of ( 6)- gingerol in spermatotoxicity resulting from colitis<disease> and benzo ( a) pyrene ( B ( a) P) , an environmental and food-borne pollutant. Group I ( control) mice received corn oil alone , while group II ( ( 6)- gingerol alone) mice orally received ( 6)- gingerol alone at 100 mg/kg body<symptom> weight. Group III ( benzo ( a) pyrene + dextran sulfate sodium ( BDS) alone) mice were orally exposed to B ( a) P at 125 mg/kg for 7 days followed by three cycles of 4 % dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS) in drinking water. A cycle consisted of seven consecutive days of exposure to DSS-treated water followed by 14 consecutive days of normal drinking water. Group IV ( BDS + ( 6)- gingerol) mice were orally treated daily with 100 mg/kg of ( 6)- gingerol during exposure to B ( a) P and DSS in the same manner as those of group III. ( 6)- Gingerol significantly abrogated BDS-mediated increase in disease activity index and restored the colon wet weight , colon length and colon mass index to near normal when compared to BDS alone group. Moreover , ( 6)- gingerol significantly prevented BDS-induced decreases in the daily sperm production ( DSP) , testicular sperm number ( TSN) , epididymal sperm number , sperm progressive<symptom> motility<symptom> and sperm membrane integrity when compared with the control. ( 6)- Gingerol markedly increased the sperm antioxidant enzymes activities and decreased the sperm head , mid-piece and tail abnormalities as well as suppressed oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers in BDS-exposed mice. ( 6)- Gingerol protected against spermatotoxicity in experimental model of interaction of colitis<disease> with environmental pollutant B ( a) P.
