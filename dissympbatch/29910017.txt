  To evaluate the prevalence , clinical relevance , and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) features of extra-capsular ganglia at the gastrocnemius origin and to assess their association with internal derangement and osteoarthritis of the knee. One hundred consecutive knee MRI examinations , obtained within a 6-month period from patients with no history of recent knee trauma , recent injections , inflammatory arthritis<disease> , infection , or tumours , were evaluated retrospectively for the presence of ganglia at the gastrocnemius origin. The lesions<symptom> were divided into two groups: an intra-capsular and an extra-capsular group. Cyst<symptom> morphology ( size , shape , and internal septa) , internal derangement of the knee ( cartilage lesion<symptom> , cruciate ligament injury , meniscal tear , and corner injury on MRI , and osteoarthritis of the knee on radiographs) were evaluated. The chi-square , Fisher 's exact , and t-tests were used to compare the two groups , in addition to multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis. Thirty-nine ganglia with an extra-capsular location were identified on 100 knee MRI ( 39 %). Rounded shape and internal septa were more common in the extra-capsular than in the intra-capsular group ( p < 0.001). Frequencies of high-grade cartilage , meniscal tear , and high-grade osteoarthritis significantly differed between the groups ( p â‰¤ 0.038). In multivariate analysis , the only significant association was between high-grade osteoarthritis and the extra-capsular group. Extra-capsular ganglia at the gastrocnemius origin were not uncommon on knee MRI and had features typical of ganglia found at other sites. High-grade osteoarthritis was significantly associated with extra-capsular ganglia.
