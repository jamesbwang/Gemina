  Efficacy and safety of biweekly cetuximab plus irinotecan were evaluated to provide guidance for its use in Japan as third-line treatment for pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC) patients harboring wild-type KRAS exon 2. Objective response rate ( ORR) was used as primary endpoint based on an expected proportion of 0.23 with confidence width of 0.298 ( 95 % CI , 0.105-0.403) , which showed 35 to be the minimal participant number. Forty patients , refractory to first- and second-line chemotherapy containing irinotecan , oxaliplatin , and fluoropyrimidine , were enrolled. ORR and disease control rate were 25.0 % ( 95 % CI: 11.5-38.4) and 72.5 % ( 95 % CI: 56.8-86.4) , respectively. Median progression-free survival ( PFS) , overall survival ( OS) , and number of courses were 5.70 months ( 95 % CI: 2.7-7.9) , 15.1 months ( 95 % CI: 11.8-19.0) , and 10.5 ( range: 3.0-31.0) , respectively. Grade 3 adverse events were skin toxicity ( 12.5 %) , diarrhea<disease> ( 10.0 %) , neutropenia ( 5.0 %) , febrile neutropenia ( 5.0 %) , nausea<symptom> ( 5.0 %) , anorexia<symptom> ( 5.0 %) , and fatigue<symptom> ( 2.5 %).
