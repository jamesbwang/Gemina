  This study aims to determine the effects of obesity and obesity related anthropometric and body composition determiners on the severity of fibromyalgia syndrome<disease> ( FS) and to compare obese , overweight and normoweight FS patients according to general health and psychological status. The study included 42 obese ( mean age 48.8 ± 11.6; range 24 to 65 years) , 27 overweight ( mean age 47.3 ± 3.4; range 24 to 61 years) and 32 normoweight ( mean age 47.1 ± 7.8 years; range 31 to 60 years) female FS patients. Widespread pain scores and symptom severity scores were noted. Pain pressure<symptom> thresholds of tender points and control points were measured and total myalgic score ( TMS) was calculated. The anthropometric assessments and skinfold measurements of all participants were recorded. Quality of life was evaluated by Health Assessment Questionnaire while psychological status was evaluated using Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory. Control points , TMS values and hand grip strength values of obese FS patients were significantly lower , while disease duration , symptom severity , widespread pain scores , visual analog scale and Health Assessment Questionnaire scores were significantly higher than normoweight and overweight FS patients. Fat free mass , fat mass , body fat percentage and waist/hip ratio values were significantly higher in obese FS patients than overweight and normoweight FS patients ( p < 0.001 for all values). Stepwise linear regression analysis showed that increased body mass index , decreased fat free mass ( R2 = 0.11) and increased disease duration ( R2 = 0.13) were associated with lower TMS. We found that obesity had significant negative effects on pain , disease severity and quality of life in patients with FS.
