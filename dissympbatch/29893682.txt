  In experimental settings , remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC) has shown a positive effect regarding spinal cord protection after local ischemia. In this study , we conducted spinal cord immunohistochemistry to demonstrate the protective effect of RIPC after 24 hours of the regional ischemia. Methods: Twenty piglets were randomized into an RIPC group ( n = 10) and a control group ( n = 10). The RIPC group underwent transient left hind<symptom> limb ischemia before systematic left subclavian artery and segmental artery occlusion at the level of the diaphragm. Twenty-four hours later , the thoracic and lumbar spinal<disease> cords<disease> were harvested , and the oxidative stress markers were immunohistochemically analysed. Results: A total of 18 animals survived the 4-hour follow up ( 10 in the RIPC group , 8 in the control group) and 14 animals survived the 24-hour follow up ( 7 in each group). In the single sections of the spinal cord , the antioxidant pathway activation was seen in the RIPC group , as OGG1 and DJ-1/ PARK7 activation was higher ( P = .038 and P = .047 , respectively). Conclusions: The results indicate that the neuroprotective effect of RIPC on the spinal cord after local ischemic insult remains controversial.
