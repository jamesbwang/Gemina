  Radiotherapy is a fundamental part of the treatment of pelvic neoplasms. Up to 90 % of patients develop gastrointestinal symptoms as a result of acute injury to the small and large intestine , particularly in the mucosa. Radiotherapy leads to atrophy of the intestinal epithelium , acute crypt inflammation<symptom> , inflammatory infiltration of the epithelium , malabsorption of lactose , and biliary salts as well as alterations in pancreatic enzymes and biliary salts , resulting in the malabsorption syndrome<disease> and dysbiosis. The most commonly reported symptoms of pelvic radiation disease include changes in bowel habits ( 94 %) , decreased fecal consistency ( 80 %) , frequency of bowel movements ( 74 %) , bowel urgency ( 39 %) , and fecal incontinence ( 37 %). Although nutritional interventions with dietary modifications have been reported to prevent and treat gastrointestinal symptoms , the evidence remains inconclusive.
