  Obesity and type II diabetes are linked to increased breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. Patients treated with the antidiabetic drug metformin for diabetes or metabolic syndrome<disease> have reduced breast cancer risk , a greater pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant therapy , and improved breast cancer survival. We hypothesized that metformin may be especially effective when targeted to the menopausal transition , as this is a lifecycle window when weight gain and metabolic syndrome<disease> increase , and is also when the risk for obesity-related breast cancer increases. Here , we used an 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea ( MNU)- induced mammary tumor rat model of estrogen receptor ( ER)- positive postmenopausal breast cancer to evaluate the long-term effects of metformin administration on metabolic and tumor endpoints. In this model , ovariectomy ( OVX) induces rapid weight gain , and an impaired whole-body response to excess calories contributes to increased tumor glucose uptake and increased tumor proliferation. Metformin treatment was initiated in tumor-bearing animals immediately prior to OVX and maintained for the duration of the study. Metformin decreased the size of existing mammary tumors and inhibited new tumor formation without changing body<symptom> weight or adiposity. Decreased lipid accumulation in the livers of metformin-treated animals supports the ability of metformin to improve overall metabolic health. We also found a decrease in the number of aromatase-positive , CD68-positive macrophages within the tumor microenvironment , suggesting that metformin targets the immune microenvironment in addition to improving whole-body metabolism. These findings suggest that peri-menopause/menopause represents a unique window of time during which metformin may be highly effective in women with established , or at high risk for developing , breast cancer.
