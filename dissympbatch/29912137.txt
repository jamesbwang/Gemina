  Because of decreased tactile sensation with thoracoscopic approaches to biopsy , localization preoperatively and intraoperatively is important for successful biopsy. Our study evaluated the technique of combined computed tomography-guided hookwire and methylene blue localization. Seventy-five patients from November 2007 to August 2013 who underwent combined Hawkins hookwire and methylene blue localization of 76 total pulmonary nodules<symptom> before video-assisted thoracic surgery-guided wedge resection were retrospectively reviewed. Multiple patient , nodule<disease> , and procedural characteristics were analyzed for correlation with successful wire localization and wire dislodgement. Successful wire localization was defined as absence of lesions<symptom> requiring re-resection , wire dislodgement necessitating re-resection , or conversion to thoracotomy for localization. Seventy-four patients were included in the study ( 75 pulmonary nodules<symptom>- 1 patient had 2 lesions<symptom> localized) and mean ± SD patient age was 65.8 ± 12.1 years and 50 % were male. The mean ± SD largest nodule diameter was 14.6 ± 7.4 mm and 29.3 % of these were subcentimeter pulmonary nodules<symptom>. Increased age and history of malignancy were associated with malignant diagnoses ( P = 0.037 and 0.009 , respectively) Successful wire localization was present in 86.4 % of patients. Lesions<symptom> with lower mean distance to the pleura correlated with successful localization ( P = 0.002). Wire dislodgement was present in 9.3 % ( 7 patients) with 4 ( 5.3 %) of these necessitating need for re-resection to establish pathologic diagnosis. Albeit wire dislodgement , 57.4 % ( 4/7) still had successful thoracoscopic localization. This study demonstrates that utilization of Hawkins hookwire in combination with methylene blue injection is an effective method to successfully localize pulmonary nodules<symptom> for thoracoscopic wedge resection and should prompt further investigation for its utilization.
