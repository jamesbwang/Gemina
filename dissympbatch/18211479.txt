  Pentavalent antimonials remain as the standard drugs in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniosis. The high cost , difficult administration , long treatment time , toxicity and increasing morbidity are factors that limit the use of these drugs. To describe the response to radiofrequency thermotherapy in the treatment of localized cutaneous leishmaniasis<disease> in Brazil , and to evaluate its safety and tolerability. We conducted a non-comparative open trial with a total of 15 patients confirmed to have cutaneous leishmaniasis<disease> on parasitological examination. A single radiofrequency thermotherapy session at 50ÂºC for 30 seconds was applied to the lesion<symptom> and its edges. In patients with more than one lesion<symptom> , only the largest one was treated initially. If after 30 days there was no evidence of healing , the smaller lesion<symptom> was also treated with thermotherapy. Clinical cure was defined as visible healing for three months after treatment. The patients were followed-up for six months and there was no follow-up loss. Of all 23 lesions<symptom> , only two evolved to complete healing without the need of treatment. Of 21 lesions<symptom> , 18 ( 85.7 %) achieved full healing. The main observed side effects were itching , burning sensation , pain and blisters. Sample with a small number of patients and short follow-up. Thermotherapy can be considered a therapeutic alternative in localized cutaneous leishmaniasis<disease> , especially in cases of single cutaneous lesions<symptom> and with formal contraindications to conventional treatment with pentavalent antimonials.
