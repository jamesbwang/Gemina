  Recent studies have reported that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α ( PPARα) agonist decreases intrahepatic resistance , whereas PPARγ agonist reduces portosystemic shunts ( PSSs) and splanchnic angiogenesis in cirrhotic rats. The present study investigated the effects of a 21-day treatment with the dual PPARα/γ agonist aleglitazar ( Ale) on progressive abnormalities in bile-duct-ligated and thioacetamide-induced cirrhotic rats with portal hypertension ( PH). In vivo and in vitro effects were evaluated. Chronic Ale treatment significantly up-regulated PPARα/PPARγ receptors and down-regulated tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) and NF-κB expression in the liver , splanchnic tissues , collateral vessels , and intestines of cirrhotic rats with PH. Notably , Ale improved PH by the suppression of systemic/tissue inflammation<symptom> , hepatic fibrosis<disease> , hepatic Rho-kinase-mediated endothelin-1 hyperresponsiveness , intrahepatic/mesenteric angiogenesis , vascular endothelial growth factor expression , PSS , intestinal mucosal injury , and hyperpermeability in cirrhotic rats. Acute Ale treatment inhibited TNF-α-enhanced endothelin-1-induced contraction of primary hepatic stellate cells , vascular endothelial growth factor-induced migration/angiogenesis of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells , and TNF-α-induced disruption of Caco-2 cell monolayer-epithelial barrier. The present study suggested that Ale can potentially treat relevant abnormalities through the inhibition of inflammatory , vasoconstrictive , angiogenic , and mucosal-disrupted pathogenic markers in cirrhosis. Overall , chronic Ale treatment ameliorated PH syndrome<disease> by the suppression of hepatic fibrogenesis , neoangiogenesis , vasoconstrictor hyperresponsiveness , splanchnic vasodilatation , and PSS; and decreased intestinal mucosal injury and hyperpermeability in cirrhotic rats.
