  Serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT)) has several biological functions. In different species , excessive 5-HT has been linked to valvular lesions<symptom> , similar to those seen in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease. Previous studies suggest higher 5-HT in healthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels ( CKCSs) , a breed highly affected by myxomatous mitral valve disease , compared to other breeds. To investigate potential interbreed variation in serum 5-HT in healthy dogs. 483 healthy dogs of nine breeds aged 1-7 years. Dogs were examined at five European centers. Absence of cardiovascular , organ-related , or systemic<disease> diseases<disease> was ensured by thorough clinical investigations including echocardiography. Serum was frozen and later analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). Median 5-HT concentration was 252.5 ( interquartile range = 145.5-390.6) ng/mL. Overall breed difference was found ( p < 0.0001) , and 42 % of pairwise breed comparisons were significant. Univariate regression analysis showed association between serum 5-HT concentration and breed , center of examination , storage time , and sex , with higher 5-HT in females. In multiple regression analysis , the final model had an adjusted R Interbreed variation in serum 5-HT concentration was found in healthy dogs aged 1-7 years. These differences should be taken into account when designing clinical studies.
