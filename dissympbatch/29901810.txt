  If mitral valve repair is not feasible , mitral valve replacement remains the only option. Based on our overall experience with the On-X mitral valve , the aim of this study was to investigate early and late outcomes after mitral valve replacement using this latest generation prosthesis. From 1998 to 2016 , 600 patients received an On-X prosthesis in the mitral position. Of them , we excluded all patients who had combined aortic procedures and retrospectively analysed 318 consecutive patients who had a mitral valve replacement. Associated procedures ( 53.5 %) were tricuspid valve repair , coronary artery bypass graft and the MAZE procedure. The mean follow-up time was 5.6 ± 4.0 years. The overall hospital mortality rate was 4.4 % , including acute cases of ischaemic mitral regurgitation ( 9.4 %) and infective endocarditis<disease> ( 9.4 %). Survival rates at 1 , 3 , 5 and 10 years were 97.8 ± 1.0 % , 92.4 ± 1.7 % , 88.4 ± 2.2 % and 70.9 ± 4.0 % , respectively. Independent predictors of late mortality were hypertension ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.91; P = 0.027) , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( HR 2.91; P = 0.003) and chronic renal<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HR 5.27; P < 0.001). Freedom from reoperation was 99.3 ± 0.5 % , 98.4 ± 0.8 % , 97.2 ± 1.2 % and 92.5 ± 2.4 % at 1 , 3 , 5 and 10 years , respectively. At follow-up , 8.5 % events were recognized as thromboembolic or haemorrhagic events; freedom from events related to anticoagulation therapy at 1 , 3 , 5 and 10 years was 99.0 ± 0.6 % , 96.8 ± 1.1 % , 93.7 ± 1.8 % and 89.0 ± 2.7 % , respectively. According to the results of this observational study , the unique design of the On-X valve works well with mitral valve diseases of various aetiologies , especially in cases with an unfavourable anatomy. This prosthesis also guarantees safe long-term durability associated with a low incidence of thromboembolism.
