  5-aminosalicylates ( 5-ASA) are frequently continued in patients with moderate-severe ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) , even after escalation to biologic agents , without evaluation of the benefit of this approach. We conducted an individual participant data ( IPD) pooled analysis of trials of infliximab and golimumab in UC , to evaluate whether concomitant use of 5-ASA modifies clinical outcomes among anti-tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- Î±-treated patients. We included IPD from five trials of infliximab and golimumab in patients with moderate-severe UC ( ACT-1 and -2 , PURSUIT-SC , PURSUIT-M , NCT00336492). Patients treated with infliximab or golimumab were categorized as receiving concomitant 5-ASA or not at time of trial entry. Primary outcome was clinical remission ( Mayo Clinic Score < 3) at last follow-up for each trial; secondary outcomes were clinical response and mucosal healing. Using multivariable logistic regression analysis , we evaluated association between concomitant 5-ASA and clinical remission , after adjusting for sex , smoking , baseline disease activity , disease extent , biochemical variables ( C-reactive protein , albumin , hemoglobin) , and concomitant prednisone and immunomodulators. We included 2183 infliximab-treated or golimumab-treated patients ( 1715 ( 78.6 %) on 5-ASA). Concomitant use of 5-ASA was not associated with odds of achieving clinical remission ( adjusted OR , 0.67 ( 95 % CI , 0.45-1.01) , p = 0.06) , clinical response ( aOR , 0.89 ( 0.60-1.33) , p = 0.58) or mucosal healing ( aOR , 1.12 ( 0.82-1.51) , p = 0.48). These results were consistent in trials of induction and maintenance therapy , and in trials of infliximab and golimumab. Based on IPD pooled analysis , in patients with moderate-severe UC who are escalated to anti-TNF therapy , continuing 5-ASA does not improve clinical outcomes.
