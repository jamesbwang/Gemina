  Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli Tang is a classical Chinese formulas treating Shaoyang syndrome<disease> complicated with Yangming syndrome<disease> according to Treatise on Febrile Diseases. This formula is used in mental disorder , nervous system , gynecologic , andrologic , and cardiovascular disease. However , its therapeutic effect on ischemia stroke and its mechanism is far from clear. In clinical practice , we have found that this formula is effective in treating ischemic stroke , which can shorten the course of the disease and reduce recurrence. The characteristics of this formula include: Shaoyang cardinal disadvantageous syndrome<disease> , mental and nervous symptoms , retained fluid punched upward syndrome<disease> and accumulation of heat in the stomach and intestines. By combining traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM) pathogenesis and efficacy with modern pathology and pharmacology , we proposed that the TCM pathogenesis of stroke , which is characterized by hyperactivity of heat combining with phlegm<symptom> , stasis and water drink , is consistent with syndromes<disease> and corresponding pathology targeted by Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli Tang , including the stress brain edema<symptom> zone around the ischemic lesion<symptom> , the increase of intracranial pressure , the excitement of sympathetic nerve , the release of monoamine neurotransmitter , the hypofunction of autonomic nervous system after stroke , and gastrointestinal stress response. Furthermore , the pharmacological mechanism of Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli Tang is concentrated on regulation the neuroendocrinology system centered by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ( HPA) , participating in the process of neuron regeneration and apoptosis , oxidative stress , hyperactivity of sympathetic nerve , and inflammatory reaction. These pathological processes are consistent with the pathological changes after ischemic stroke. Therefore , Chaihu Jia Longgu Muli Tang is a key formula for treating ischemic stroke.
