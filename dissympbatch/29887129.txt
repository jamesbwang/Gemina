  We present the preliminary results of the study focused on the impact of subthalamic deep brain stimulation ( DBS-STN) on sleep and other non-motor symptoms ( NMS). Ten patients with advanced PD , underwent two-night polysomnography ( PSG) mean 1.1 week before surgery and 6.2 months post DBS programming. NMS were assessed with a set of scales before surgery and 6 months and 12 months following DBS programming. Contrary to previous studies , we noted deterioration of sleep pattern in the follow-up PSG. We found a decrease in total sleep time , duration of the stage N2 , with prolongation of stage N1 and wakefulness after sleep onset. We did not detect any impact of DBS-STN on subjective severity of restless legs syndrome<disease>. REM- sleep behavior disorder , however reported was not observed in any patient during PSG evaluations. We also found statistically significant correlations between severity of sleep disturbances and quality of life , as well as , between severity of motor<symptom> symptoms<symptom> and worse objective sleep quality. We found that DBS-STN improved quality of life , subjective quality of sleep and sleepiness , however , contrary to the previous studies the objective parameters of sleep worsened after the surgery.
