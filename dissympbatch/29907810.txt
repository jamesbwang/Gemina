  Primary myelofibrosis ( PMF) is a hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC) disease , characterized by aberrant differentiation of all myeloid lineages and profound disruption of the bone<disease> marrow niche. PMF samples carry several mutations , but their cell origin and hierarchy in regulating the different waves of clonal and aberrant myeloproliferation from the prime HSC compartment is poorly understood. Genotyping of > 2000 colonies from CD133 + HSC and progenitors from PMF patients confirmed the complex genetic heterogeneity within the neoplastic population. Notably , mutations in chromatin regulators ASXL1 and/or EZH2 were identified as the first genetic lesions<symptom> , preceding both JAK2-V617F and CALR mutations , and are thus drivers of clonal myelopoiesis in a PMF subset. HSC from PMF patients with double ASXL1/EZH2 mutations exhibited significantly higher engraftment in immunodeficient mice than those from patients without histone modifier mutations. EZH2 mutations correlate with aberrant erythropoiesis in PMF patients , exemplified by impaired maturation and cell cycle arrest of erythroid progenitors. These data underscore the importance of post-transcriptional modifiers of histones in neoplastic stem cells , whose clonal growth sustains aberrant myelopoiesis and expansion of pre-leukemic clones in PMF.
