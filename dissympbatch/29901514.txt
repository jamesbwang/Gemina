  Acute pancreatitis<disease> can result in a number of localized complications such as pancreatic pseudocysts , walled-off pancreatic necrosis<symptom> ( WON) , and disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome<disease> ( DPDS). The management of these conditions has evolved over the past three decades such that minimally invasive endoscopic drainage and debridement methods are now the favored , first-line approach. This article will review the latest developments and controversies regarding the endoscopic management of these conditions. For patients with pancreatic pseudocysts , it remains to be clear what the role of routine ERCP is in this population. For WON , it is clear that when expertise is available , a minimally invasive approach may be the most suitable option. There is a growing literature raising concern about LAMS-associated bleeding in this group , however. Alterations in LAMS placement and stent dwell time may reduce this risk. Lastly , recognition of the DPDS is an important factor that needs to be recognized whenever present , as these patients will require a long-term management strategy and may require multimodality intervention. Despite the development of new endoscopic techniques and dedicated devices for managing pancreatic fluid collections and disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome<disease> , a number of issues remain unresolved in terms of best practice methods.
