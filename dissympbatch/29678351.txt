  Asthma is a chronic obstructive respiratory<disease> disease<disease> characterised by bronchial inflammation<symptom>. Its biological and clinical features have been widely explored and a number of pharmacological treatments are currently available. Currently several aspects of asthma pathophysiological background remain unclear , and this is crucial for the traditional asthma phenotype approach as well as for new endotype definition. In this scenario , the identification of new molecular and clinical biomarkers may be helpful in order to better understand the disease , define specific diagnostic tools and highlight relevant novel targets for pharmacology treatments. Omics technologies offer an innovative research tool for addressing the above mentioned goals. However , there is still a lot to do both in the fields of basic research and in the clinical application of these new technologies. Recently , genome-wide association studies , microRNAs and proteomics are contributing to enrich the available data for the identification of new asthma biomarkers. A precise approach to the patient with asthma , particularly with severe uncontrolled asthma , requires new and specific therapeutic targets , but also proper tools able to drive the clinician in tailoring the treatment. On the other hand , treatment response predictors are needed , particularly in the field of biological drugs , whose sustainability implies a correct and precise patient selection. Translating acquired knowledge about omics in clinical practice may address the unmet needs described above , but large-scale studies are required in order to confirm omics relevance and effectiveness in daily practice. Thus in our opinion the application of omics is still lagging in the real-life setting.
