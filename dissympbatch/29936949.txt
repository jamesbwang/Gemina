  Dual-energy CT ( DECT) is a rapidly growing tool in musculoskeletal radiology. It has been validated as an accurate imaging modality for the assessment of gout and bone<disease> marrow edema<symptom>. DECT can be used to reduce metal artifacts. A few studies have shown its ability to calculate bone mineral density and examine pathologic states in tendons and ligaments. Its capacity for material separation suggests its emergence as a technique for arthrography , and for the evaluation of intervertebral discs and other inflammatory arthropathies.
