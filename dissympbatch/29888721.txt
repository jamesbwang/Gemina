  Patients with sickle cell disease ( SCD) may require repeated transfusions , which inevitably lead to iron overload ( IOL).: This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of oral deferasirox ( DFX) in patients with SCD and transfusional IOL. A descriptive study has been performed on patients with SCD who have completed at least 3 years on DFX. Height and weight were checked every 3-6 months. The efficacy was assessed based on serum ferritin ( SF) levels. The safety was assessed based on adverse events ( AEs) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) , and serum creatinine ( S. Cr) levels.: A total of 102 patients ( 61 males and 41 females) were recruited. Their mean daily iron intake was 0.13 ± 0.06 mg/kg. SF levels declined significantly from 2434.1 ± 132.9 ng/ml at the start of the study to 1655.8 ± 154.2 ng/ml at the end of the study ( P < 0.05) , with significant decreases observed after increasing the DFX dose to ≥ 30 mg/kg/day. ALT ( 12.8 ± 9.9 vs. 12.1 ± 7.1 U/L) and S. Cr ( 72.4 ± 9.2 vs. 74.1 ± 7.9 mmol/L) levels did not show significant differences from the start to the end of the study ( P > 0.05). Thirty-eight patients ( 37 %) developed AEs. The most common were abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> ( 24.5 %) , diarrhea<disease> ( 8.0 %) , and nausea<symptom> ( 7.8 %). AEs were predominantly transient and mild to moderate in nature. This study has revealed that DFX is a safe , tolerable , and effective drug for reducing IOL in SCD patients , though it is associated with mild and transient adverse events.
