  Chest<symptom> pain<symptom> is one of the most common , potentially serious presenting complaints for adult emergency department ( ED) visits. The challenge of acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) identification with appropriate disposition is quite significant. Many of these patients are low risk and can be managed non-urgently in the outpatient environment; other patients , however , are intermediate to high risk for ACS and should be managed more aggressively , likely with inpatient admission and cardiology consultation. The HEART score , a recently derived clinical decision rule aimed at the identification of risk in the undifferentiated chest<symptom> pain<symptom> patient , is potentially quite useful as an adjunct to physician medical decision-making. The HEART score identifies patients at low , intermediate , and high risk for short-term adverse outcome resulting from ACS. As is true of all such clinical decision rules , the physician should consider the information provided the HEART score yet exercise clinical judgment in the ultimate determination of management strategy in the adult chest<symptom> pain<symptom> patient suspected of ACS.
