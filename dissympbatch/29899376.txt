  Hypertension is strongly associated with chronic<disease> diseases<disease> such as myocardial infarction , stroke , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , and renal<symptom> failure<symptom>. The objective of this study is to determine the trend of prevalence , awareness , treatment , and control of hypertension among Malaysian population since 2006 to 2015. The study used the data from National Health and Morbidity Survey ( NHMS) 2006 , 2011 , and 2015. It was a cross-sectional with two-stage stratified random sampling throughout Malaysia for eligible respondents 18 years old and above. Respondents were interviewed face to face and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> was recorded as the average reading from two electronic pressure monitoring measurements. Data was analyzed using the Complex sample module in SPSS Version 20. The prevalence of hypertension in Malaysia was 34.6 % ( 95 % CI: 33.9 , 35.3) in 2006 , 33.6 % ( 95 % CI: 32.6 , 34.6) in 2011 and 35.3 % ( 95 % CI: 34.5 , 36.3) in 2015. Awareness of hypertension in 2006 , 2011 , and 2015 was 35.6 % ( 95 % CI: 34.6 , 36.6) , 40.7 % ( 95 % CI: 39.3 , 42.1) , and 37.5 % ( 95 % CI: 36.1 , 38.9) respectively. The trend of receiving treatment from 2006 to 2015 was 78.9 % ( 95 % CI: 77.5 , 80.2) to 83.2 % ( 95 % CI: 81.3 , 84.8). The control of hypertension increased significantly from 27.5 % ( 95 % CI: 25.9 , 29.2) in 2006 to 37.4 % ( 95 % CI: 35.3 , 39.5) in 2015. Despite higher proportions receiving treatment over time , the control of hypertension remained below 40 % since NHMS 2006 until 2015. The strategies to further reduce the prevalence and increase awareness of hypertension should be enhanced particularly among the targeted age group to ensure early detection , treatment , and control thus preventing from long-term complications.
