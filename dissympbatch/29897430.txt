  Little is known about respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( RTI) severity in children following consultation. To investigate post-consultation symptom trajectories in children with acute<symptom> cough<symptom> and RTI and whether baseline characteristics predict trajectory group. Prospective cohort study of 2296 children ( 3 months-16 years) whose parents were invited to report cough<symptom> severity and duration using a 7-point Likert scale. Longitudinal latent class analysis ( LLCA) was used to identify post-consultation symptom trajectories in the first 15 days , and multinomial models to predict class membership. Complete data were available for 1408 children ( 61 %). The best LLCA model identified five post-consultation symptom trajectory groups: ` very rapid recovery ' ( 28.5 %) , ` rapid recovery ' ( 37.7 %) , ` intermediate recovery ' ( 18.2 %) , ` persistent symptoms ' ( 9.5 %) and ` initial deterioration with persistent symptoms ' ( 6.0 %). Compared with very rapid recovery , parent-reported severe<symptom> cough<symptom> in the 24 hours prior to consultation increased the likelihood of rapid recovery ( OR 1.79 ( 95 % CI 1.23 , 2.60)) , intermediate recovery ( OR 2.13 ( 1.38 , 3.30) and initial deterioration with persistent symptoms ( OR 2.29 ( 1.26 , 4.16)). Initial deterioration was also associated with ` severe barking cough<symptom> ' ( OR 3.64 ( 1.50 , 8.82)) , ` severely reduced energy in the 24 hours prior to consultation ' ( OR 3.80 ( 1.62 , 8.87) and higher parent-assessed illness severity at consultation ( OR 2.21 ( 1.17 , 4.18)). We identified five distinct symptom trajectory groups showing the majority of children improved post-consultation , with only one group experiencing illness deterioration. The few characteristics associated with group membership did not fall into a pattern that seemed clinically useful.
