  The burden of asthma in the elderly is increasing , but the etiology of asthma in the elderly is not clearly understood. Recent studies have reported the epidemiological link between metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MS) and asthma , but it has rarely been studied in the elderly. This study investigated the association between MS and asthma and the contribution of insulin resistance ( IR) and systemic inflammation<symptom> to this MS-asthma association in the elderly. Our study analyzed 4,060 elderly participants ( â‰¥ 65 years old) from a cross-sectional survey , the Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey 2007-2012. Mediation analyses were performed to examine whether IR and systemic inflammation<symptom> mediates the MS-asthma association. Participants with MS had significantly higher prevalence of asthma ( adjusted odds ratio = 1.34; 95 % confidence interval = 1.09-1.64) , and those who had greater waist circumference and lower HDL-C were especially likely to have asthma. Participants with IR and systemic inflammation<symptom> were associated with higher prevalence of asthma. Prevalence of IR and systemic inflammation<symptom> were higher in participants with MS or with each MS component. The MS-asthma association was substantially mediated by IR and systemic inflammation<symptom>. Our study showed a significant association between MS and asthma in the elderly. MS might affect asthma through both IR and systemic
