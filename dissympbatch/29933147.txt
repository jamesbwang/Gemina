  Depression<symptom> and acute coronary syndromes<disease> ( ACS) are both common public health challenges. Patients with ACS often develop depression<symptom> , which in turn adversely affects prognosis. Low-cost , sustainable , and effective service models that integrate depression<symptom> care into the management of ACS patients to reduce depression<symptom> and improve ACS outcomes are critically needed. Integrating Depression<symptom> Care in ACS patients in Low Resource Hospitals in China ( I-CARE) is a multicenter , randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of an 11-month integrated care ( IC) intervention compared to usual care ( UC) in management of ACS patients. Four thousand inpatients will be recruited and then randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an IC intervention consisting of nurse-led risk factor management , group-based counseling supplemented by individual problem-solving therapy , and antidepressant medications as needed , or to UC. The primary outcomes are depression<symptom> symptoms measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 at 6 and 12 months. Secondary endpoints include anxiety<symptom> measured by the Generalized Anxiety<symptom> Disorder-7; quality of life measured by the EQ-5D at 6 and 12 months; and major adverse events including the combined end point of all-cause death , suicide attempts , nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal stroke , and all-cause rehospitalization at yearly intervals for a median follow-up of 2 years. Analyses of the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of IC also will be performed. I-CARE trial will be the largest study to test the effectiveness of an integrated care model on depression<symptom> and cardiovascular outcomes among ACS patients in resource-limited clinical settings.
