  Drug-induced pancreatitis<disease> can be caused by a wide array of medications. In fact , the diagnosis is likely commonly missed due to the difficulty in diagnosing one agent as the sole cause. We present a case of dapsone-induced pancreatitis<disease> in a 75-year-old male with history of celiac disease. He presented with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and was found to have acute pancreatitis<disease> Interestingly , he had been on dapsone for 5 years and had no other recent medication changes , significant alcohol use , or gallbladder disease. It was determined this was an episode of delayed acute pancreatitis<disease> due to dapsone. This is a rarely addressed entity in the literature and is the first case in which pancreatitis<disease> occurred so late in a patient 's treatment course on dapsone.
