  Obesity is a worldwide epidemic , particularly in Western society. It predisposes surgical patients to an increased risk of adverse outcomes. The aim of our study was to use a nationally representative vascular database and to compare in-hospital outcomes in obese vs nonobese patients undergoing elective open aortic repair ( OAR) and endovascular aneurysm<disease> repair ( EVAR). All patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> repair were identified in the Vascular Quality Initiative database ( 2003-2017). Obesity was defined as body mass index â‰¥ 30 kg/m We identified a total of 33,082 patients undergoing elective OAR ( nonobese , n = 4605 ( 72.4 %); obese , n = 1754 ( 27.6 %)) and EVAR ( nonobese , n = 18,338 ( 68.6 %); obese , n = 8385 ( 31.4 %)). Obese patients undergoing OAR and EVAR were relatively younger compared with nonobese patients ( mean age ( standard deviation) , 67.55 ( 8.26) years vs 70.27 ( 8.30) years and 71.06 ( 8.22) years vs 74.55 ( 8.55) years) , respectively; ( both P < .001). Regardless of approach , obese patients had slightly longer operative time ( OAR , 259.02 ( 109.97) minutes vs 239.37 ( 99.78) minutes; EVAR , 138.27 ( 70.64) minutes vs 134.34 ( 69.98) minutes) and higher blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( OAR , 2030 ( 1823) mL vs 1619 ( 1642) mL; EVAR , 228 ( 354) mL vs 207 ( 312) mL; both P < .001). There was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups undergoing OAR and EVAR ( OAR , 2.9 % vs 3.2 % ( P = .50); EVAR , 0.5 % vs 0.6 % ( P = .76)). On multivariable analysis , obese patients undergoing OAR had 33 % higher odds of renal<symptom> failure<symptom> ( adjusted odds ratio ( OR) , 1.33; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.09-1.63; P = .006) and 75 % higher odds of wound<disease> infections<disease> ( adjusted OR , 1.75; 95 % CI , 1.11-2.76; P = .02) compared with nonobese patients. However , in patients undergoing EVAR , no association was seen between obesity and any major complications. A significant interaction was found between obesity and surgical approach in the event of renal<symptom> failure<symptom> , in which obese patients undergoing OAR had significantly higher odds of renal<symptom> failure<symptom> compared with those in the EVAR group ( OR Using a large nationally representative database , we demonstrated an increased risk of renal<symptom> failure<symptom> and wound<disease> infections<disease> in obese patients undergoing OAR compared with nonobese patients. On the other hand , obesity did not seem to increase the odds of major adverse outcomes in patients undergoing EVAR. Further long-term prospective studies are needed to verify the effects of obesity after abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> repair and the implications of these findings in clinical decision-making.
