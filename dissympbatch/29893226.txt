  Psoriatic arthritis<disease> is a chronic , immune-mediated , inflammatory arthropathy that presents with inflammation<symptom> of the joints and entheses , including those of the axial skeleton , and is associated with increased mortality from cardiovascular disease. Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical phenotype because of the diversity of the associated features , which can include skin and nail disease , dactylitis , uveitis , and osteitis. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis<disease> has led to the development of effective biologics and small-molecular drugs targeting specific cytokines and signalling pathways , which can prevent disease progression and improve quality of life. However , at least 40 % of patients with psoriatic arthritis<disease> have only a partial response or fail to respond to such treatments. Cytokine inhibitors , mainly those specific for tumour necrosis<symptom> factor and , more recently , the interleukin 23-T-helper-17 cell pathway , have been highly successful in the treatment of disease manifestations in several different tissues , although targeting the interleukin 23-T-helper-17 cell pathway might be more effective in psoriasis than in arthritis<disease>. However , the precise mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis-which include genetics , environmental factors , and immune-mediated inflammation-are complex , and the relationship between disease of the joint and that of other domains is poorly understood. Improving our understanding of psoriatic arthritis<disease> pathogenesis could help to establish validated biomarkers for diagnosis , predict therapeutic response and remission , develop precision medicines , and predict which patients will respond to which therapy. We discuss advances in pathogenetic translational research that could inform these issues.
