  Human pulmonary dirofilariasis is a rare zoonosis caused by the dog worm Dirofilaria spp. , a parasite transmitted by mosquitos and resulting in peripheral lung nodules<symptom>. The filarial nematode enters the subcutaneous tissue , travels to the right ventricle and dies causing a small pulmonary infarction that may embolize through the pulmonary vessels and may appear as a solitary nodule<disease>. These nodules<symptom> are usually incidentally identified in asymptomatic patients undergoing chest imaging studies , and are generally interpreted to be malignant. We present the case report of a human dirofilariasis in a patient with multiple pulmonary nodules<symptom> resected using video-assisted thoracic surgery ( VATS). According to our literature review , this is the first case with double synchronous lung nodules<symptom> reported in Italy. Minimally invasive resection with histologic examination may be the best approach for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary dirofilariasis. Polymerase Chain Reaction testing may provide a more accurate etiological diagnosis in case of an inconclusive pathology result.
