  Brazilian jiu-jitsu ( BJJ) is a martial art that focuses on groundwork , joint locks , and chokeholds. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of injuries sustained during BJJ training. A 27-question research survey was e-mailed to 166 BJJ gyms in the United States. Demographic information , belt level , weight class , training hours , competition experience , and injury prevalence data were collected. The majority of respondents were Caucasian ( n = 96) males ( n = 121) with an average age of 30.3 years. Overall , the most common injury locations were to the hand and fingers ( n = 70) , foot and toes ( n = 52) , and arm and elbow ( n = 51). The most common medically diagnosed conditions were skin<disease> infections<disease> ( n = 38) , injuries to the knee ( n = 26) , and foot and toes ( n = 19). The most common non-medically diagnosed injuries occurred to the hand and fingers ( n = 56) , arm and elbow ( n = 40) , and foot and toes ( n = 33). In general , athletes were more likely to sustain distal rather than proximal injuries. Athletes reported more frequent medically diagnosed injuries to the lower extremity and more frequent self-diagnosed injuries to the upper extremity. Upper<symptom> extremity injuries appear to be more frequent but less severe than lower extremity injuries with the opposite being true for lower extremity injuries.
