  Oxidative stress is a central event linked with endothelial dysfunction and inflammation<symptom> in several vascular pathologies , marked by over-production of ROS and concomitant decreases in antioxidants , for example GSH. Here , we distinguish endothelial oxidative stress regulation and associated functional disparities in the two main vascular conduits , ( arteries and veins) following decreases in GSH. MAECs and VCECs were used as models of arterial and venular endothelium , respectively , and BSO ( 0-100 Î¼mol/L) was used to indirectly increase cellular oxidative stress. Inflammatory responses were measured using immune cell attachment and immunoblotting for endothelial cell adhesion molecule ( ICAM-1 , VCAM-1) expression , altered cell proliferation , and wound<disease> healing. MAECs and VCECs exhibited differential responses to oxidative stress produced by GSH depletion with VCECs exhibiting greater sensitivity to oxidative stress. Compared to MAECs , VCECs showed a significantly increased inflammatory profile and a decreased proliferative phenotype in response to decreases in GSH levels. Arterial and venous endothelial cells exhibit differential responses to oxidant stress , and decreases in GSH: GSSG are more exacerbated in venous endothelial cells. Specific pathogenesis in these vascular conduits , with respect to oxidant stress handling , warrants further study , especially considering surgical interventions such as Coronary artery bypass grafting that use both interchangeably.
