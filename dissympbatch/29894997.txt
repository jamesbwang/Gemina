  The metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) is a conglomerate of clinical findings that convey into increased morbidity and mortality from type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2D) and cardiovascular disease. Hyperprolactinemia ( hyperPRL) is associated with components of MetS , especially during pregnancy. Endogenous levels of sex steroids are high during pregnancy in contrast to untreated or replaced hypogonadism in most patients with a prolactinoma and hypogonadism may confer increased risk of MetS in hyperPRL. Dopamine-D2-agonist therapy can improve MetS in patients with a prolactinoma and lower glucose levels in patients with T2D. HyperPRL is a biomarker for decreased dopaminergic tonus in the hypothalamic-pituitary circuit. Patients with a prolactinoma , patients with schizophrenia and/or T2D often have disturbances in this balance<symptom> and the finding of lower prolactin ( PRL) levels in polycystic ovary syndrome<disease> ( PCOS) may indicate increased dopaminergic tonus. Recent studies supported that PRL levels within or above reference range may be differently related to MetS. In healthy study populations and in PCOS , PRL levels were inversely associated with metabolic risk markers. Ongoing research on PRL fragments , vasoinhibins , may help explain some of the contradicting findings between prolactin levels and metabolism. Improved knowledge about MetS in hyperPRL can characterize subgroups of patients with hyperPRL , who would not otherwise be considered as candidates for dopamine-D2-agonist therapy such as patients with postpartum cardiomyopathy and postmenopausal women with T2D.
