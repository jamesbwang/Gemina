  Few studies have investigated the use of endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD) for cecal tumors extending into the appendiceal orifice. Herein , we assessed the feasibility and safety of ESD for cecal tumors extending into the appendiceal orifice. We retrospectively examined the outcomes of ESD for 78 patients with 78 cecal tumors ( male/female ratio , 40/38; mean ( standard deviation , SD) age , 67 ( 9) years; mean ( SD) tumor size , 32 ( 15) mm) , who underwent ESD at the Hiroshima University Hospital between October 2008 and March 2016. The indication for ESD in cecal tumors extending into the appendiceal orifice was recognition of the distal edge of the lesion<symptom> in the appendix. They were classified into two groups: patients with cecal tumors extending ( Group A: 29 patients , 29 tumors) and not extending ( Group B: 49 patients , 49 tumors) into the appendiceal orifice. We compared the outcomes of ESD between both groups. No significant differences in clinicopathological characteristics were observed between both groups. The rate of severe submucosal fibrosis<disease> in Group A ( 48 %) was significantly higher than that in Group B ( 24 %) ( ESD for cecal tumors with extension into the appendiceal orifice is effective and safe.
