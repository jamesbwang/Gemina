  Pancreatic radiation effect ( PRE) can be a component of gastrointestinal tract ( GIT) radiotoxicity. This inter-organ correlation between the GIT and the pancreas was assessed through a rat model. Separate local irradiation to the abdomen and the pelvis was applied concurrently for 8-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats. Abdominal irradiation was categorized into pancreatic shield ( PS) and non-pancreatic shield ( NPS) irradiation. After 5 Gy and 15 Gy irradiation , the rectal mucosa was analyzed at the first week ( early phase , Ep) and the 14th week ( late phase , Lp). A slow gain in body<symptom> weight was observed initially , particularly in the NPS group receiving a 15 Gy dose ( P < 0.001). The large number of apoptotic bodies after 15 Gy at Ep decreased at Lp. At Ep for the 5-Gy group , the NPS group revealed more fibrotic change than the PS group ( P = 0.002). Cleaved caspase-3 ( CCP3) expression was greater at Lp , and the Ep-Lp increase was prominent in the NPS-15-Gy group ( P = 0.010). At Lp , for 15 Gy irradiation , CCP3 was expressed more in the NPS group than in the PS group ( P = 0.032). Despite no direct toxicity difference between the PS and NPS groups , small changes in parameters such as fibrosis<disease> or CCP3 expression suggest that pancreatic shielding does have an effect on the radiation response in the rectal mucosa , which suggests a need for a multi-organ effect-based approach in GIT radiotoxicity assessment.
