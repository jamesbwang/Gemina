  Macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF) is a cytokine with pleiotropic actions involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders , including Multiple Sclerosis ( MS). We have first evaluated in silico the involvement of MIF , its homologue D-DT , and the receptors CD74 , CD44 , CXCR2 and CXCR4 in encephalitogenic T cells from a mouse model of MS , the Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis<disease> ( EAE) , as well as in circulating T helper cells from MS patients. We show an upregulation of the receptors involved in MIF signaling both in the animal model and in patients. Also , a significant increase in MIF receptors is found in the CNS lesions<symptom> associated to MS. Finally , the specific inhibitor of MIF , ISO-1 , improved both ex vivo and in vivo the features of EAE. Overall , our data indicate that there is a significant involvement of the MIF pathway in MS ethiopathogenesis and that interventions specifically blocking MIF receptors may represent useful therapeutic approaches in the clinical setting.
