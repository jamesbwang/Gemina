  Significant research efforts have been made to improve the safety and efficacy of endovascular aneurysm<disease> repair ( EVAR) in treating abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease>. This study aimed to examine the trends of perioperative outcomes of EVAR in the recent decade using a national validated database. Patients who underwent EVAR for intact abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> between 2006 and 2015 were identified from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and divided into early ( 2006-2010) and late ( 2011-2015) periods. The primary outcome of the study was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included operative time , length of hospital stay , and 30-day major complications ( renal , cardiopulmonary , and wound<disease> infection<disease> A total of 30,076 patients were identified , with 11,539 in the early period and 18,537 in the late period. The 30-day mortality was kept at a low level in both periods ( 1.2 % vs 1.2 %; P = .98) , whereas both the mean operation time ( 155.5 ± 72.6 minutes vs 141.9 ± 73.7 minutes; P < .001) and length of hospital stay ( 3.24 ± 5.32 days vs 2.81 ± 4.30 days; P < .001) were decreased in the late period. The 30-day major complication rate was reduced by 19.6 % ( 5.1 % vs 4.1 %; P < .0001) , with decreased renal<symptom> failure<symptom> ( 1.4 % vs 1.0 %; P = .003) , cardiopulmonary complications ( 2.2 % vs 1.7 %; P = .006) , and wound<disease> complications ( 2.5 % vs 1.8 %; P < .001). All the decreasing trends of mortality , any 30-day complication , and each type of major complication were statistically significant. Being treated in the late period was independently associated with decreased 30-day major complications ( odds ratio , 0.75; 95 % confidence interval , 0.65-0.87; P < .001) , and this effect was confirmed in the propensity score-matched cohort ( odds ratio , 0.76; 95 % confidence interval , 0.66-0.90; P < .001). Although the 30-day mortality remains similar , postoperative complications in EVAR have decreased significantly during the recent decade. The continuous improvement in endograft technology and surgical skills has resulted in decreased operative time , marked reduction in surgical complications , and shorter hospital length of stay after endovascular repair.
