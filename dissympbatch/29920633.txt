  The aim of this study was to report our initial experience using spiral intestinal lengthening and tailoring ( SILT) technique in selected cases of short bowel syndrome<disease> ( SBS). We analyzed all cases of SBS underwent SILT in our unit since the introduction of the procedure in 2012. We retrospectively analyzed patients ' demographics , pre- and postprocedure bowel length , surgical complications , and postoperative parenteral nutrition ( PN) requirements. Data were compared using independent samples , Mann-Whitney 's Five children with SBS underwent SILT between 2012 and 2017. Median age at procedure was 8.3 months ( 4.5-16). Preoperative small bowel length measured a median of 22 cm ( 17.5-50) with a median diameter of 4 cm ( 3.5-4.6). SILT allowed a median increase in length of 56 % ( 10-15 cm; In our experience , SILT is a promising adjunct in the surgical management of SBS. It can be used to tailor and lengthen mildly dilated segments of the bowel where other procedures are technically challenging , with a view to reduce the risk of intestinal<symptom> failure<symptom> associated liver disease and thereby improving chances for quality survival. Further studies are needed to investigate long-term outcomes of SILT in pediatric SBS.
