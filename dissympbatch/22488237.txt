  Experimental models have often been at the origin of immunological paradigms such as the M1/M2 dichotomy following macrophage polarization. However , this clear dichotomy in animal models is not as obvious in humans , and the separating line between M1-like and M2-like macrophages is rather represented by a continuum , where boundaries are still unclear. Indeed , human<disease> infectious<disease> diseases<disease> , are characterized by either a back and forth or often a mixed profile between the pro-inflammatory microenvironment ( dominated by interleukin ( IL) -1 & beta; , IL-6 , IL-12 , IL-23 and Tumor Necrosis<symptom> Factor ( TNF)- & alpha; cytokines) and tissue injury driven by classically activated macrophages ( M1-like) and wound<disease> healing driven by alternatively activated macrophages ( M2-like) in an anti-inflammatory environment ( dominated by IL-10 , Transforming growth factor ( TGF)- & beta; , chemokine ligand ( CCL) 1 , CCL2 , CCL17 , CCL18 , and CCL22). This review brews the complexity of the situation during infectious<disease> diseases<disease> by stressing on this continuum between M1-like and M2-like extremes. We first discuss the basic biology of macrophage polarization , function , and role in the inflammatory process and its resolution. Secondly , we discuss the relevance of the macrophage polarization continuum during infectious and neglected diseases , and the possibility to interfere with such activation states as a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of such diseases.
