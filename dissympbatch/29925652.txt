  Human coronaviruses ( HCoV) are recognized respiratory pathogens for which accumulating evidence indicates that in vulnerable patients , the infection can cause more severe pathologies. HCoVs are not always confined to the upper respiratory<disease> tract<symptom> and can invade the CNS upon still unclear circumstances. HCoV-induced neuropathologies in human are difficult to diagnose early enough to allow therapeutic interventions. Making use of our already described animal model of HCoV neuropathogenesis , we describe the route of neuropropagation from the nasal cavity to the olfactory bulb , piriform cortex then brainstem. We identified neuron-to-neuron propagation as one underlying mode of virus spreading in cell culture. Our data demonstrate that both passive diffusion of released viral particles and axonal transport are valid propagation strategies used by the virus. We describe for the first time the presence along axons of viral platforms whose static dynamism are reminiscent of viral assembly sites. We further revealed that HCoV-OC43 modes of propagation could be modulated by selected HCoV-OC43 proteins and axonal transport. Our work , therefore , identifies processes that may govern the severity and nature of HCoV-OC43 neuropathogenesis and will make possible the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent occurrences.
