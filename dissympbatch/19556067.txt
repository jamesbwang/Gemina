  Triticum vulgare has been extensively used in traditional medicine thanks to its properties of accelerating tissue repair. The specific extract of Triticum vulgare manufactured by Farmaceutici Damor ( TVE-DAMOR) is already present in some pharmaceutical formulations used in the treatment of decubitus ulcers<disease> , skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> and burns. It has been recently suggested that this Triticum vulgare extract may possess potential anti-inflammatory properties. In the light of these premises the aim of the present paper was to verify the anti-inflammatory role of TVE , using the LPS-stimulated microglia model of inflammation<symptom>. In particular the effect of different concentrations of TVE on the release of several mediators of inflammation<symptom> such as nitric oxide , IL-6 , PGE2 and TNF alpha was evaluated. More important , the anti-inflammatory effect of TVE was confirmed also in primary rat microglia cultures. The results of the present study show that TVE exerts anti-inflammatory properties since it reduces the release of all the evaluated markers of inflammation<symptom> , such as NO , IL6 , TNF alpha and PGE2 in LPS-activated BV2 microglial cells. Intriguingly , TVE reduced microglia activation and NO release also in primary microglia. Indeed , to verify the pathway of modulation of the inflammatory markers reported above , we found that TVE restores the cytoplasmic expression of p65 protein , kwown as specific marker associated with activation of inflammatory response. The evidence for an inhibitory activity on inflammation<symptom> of this specific extract of Triticum vulgare may open the way to the possibility of a therapeutical use of the Triticum vulgare extract as an anti-inflammatory compound in certain pathological states such as burns , decubitus ulcers<disease> , folliculitis and inflammation<symptom> of peripheral nerve.
