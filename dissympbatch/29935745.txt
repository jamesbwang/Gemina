  Pain perception and pain behaviors<symptom> are distinct phenomena with different functions. Pain behaviors<symptom> are protective in their functions , which include eliciting empathy or caring behaviors from others. Moreover , pain behaviors<symptom> are intertwined with interpersonal relationships with significant others , which is why attachment orientations have been suggested as interpersonal schemas moderating the association between pain and pain behaviors<symptom>. The aim of the current study was to assess the impact of insecure attachment dimensions on pain behaviors<symptom> in laboratory-induced pain. This experimental study included a sample of 60 patients with low<symptom> back<symptom> pain<symptom> recruited from a large spine center in a hospital in Region of Southern Denmark. Patients were recorded on video during a cold pressor procedure and asked to rate their level of pain. Prior to the procedure , attachment orientations were assessed by the Revised Adult<disease> Attachment Scale. Two assessors independently coded the recorded video material for protective and communicative pain behaviors<symptom>. A positive correlation of moderate size was found between pain intensity and pain communication. As hypothesized , attachment anxiety<symptom> moderated the association between pain and pain behaviors<symptom>. A high level of attachment anxiety<symptom> was associated with at weaker association between pain and pain behaviors<symptom>. None of the attachment dimensions correlated with pain intensity or pain behaviors<symptom>. The results indicate that patients with high levels of attachment anxiety<symptom> may downplay pain and communication thereof. This finding is of potential clinical importance , since pain communication , among others , serves the function of eliciting caring behavior from healthcare personnel.
