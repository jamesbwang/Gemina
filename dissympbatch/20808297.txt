  Crohn 's Disease ( CD) is typically characterized by abdominal<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , however , besides gastrointestinal symptoms , CD patients may suffer from extraintestinal manifestations which are far less common and medical treatment can be challenging. We report about a 34-year-old Crohn 's Disease ( CD) patient in clinical remission under adalimumab therapy who presented in the clinic for Cranio-Maxillo Surgery due to severe<symptom> pain<symptom> in the mandibular area. Ulcerative lesions<symptom> of the buccal-side mucosa of the right mandible were detected. To rule out malignancy , a biopsy was obtained and revealed ulcerative stomatitis with noncaseating granulomas<disease> consistent with oral CD. Shortening the adalimumab administration interval to weekly injections resulted in a complete healing of the oral CD lesions<symptom> without residual inflammation<symptom>. The case presented here demonstrates that gastroenterologists should evaluate and consider oral CD lesions<symptom> as a possible marker of disease activity in patients despite having quiescent intestinal CD.
