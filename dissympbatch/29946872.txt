  The aim of the present study is to investigate the frequency of celiac disease in children with peptic ulcers<disease> and to compare it with that of non-celiac peptic ulcers<disease> in terms of clinical and laboratory values. Upper<symptom> gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed in 1769 patients at the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology , The Faculty of Medicine , Cukurova University , Turkey , between January 2012 and January 2017. These cases consisted of subjects presenting with various GIS symptoms and indicated for endoscopy ( with chronic diarrhea<disease> , delayed growth and development , abdominal<symptom> pains<symptom> , GIS bleeding , etc.). The levels of immunoglobulin A ( IgA) serum anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies , IgA anti-endomysial antibodies ( EMA) , and IgA serum were estimated in the patients with peptic ulcers<disease>. Celiac disease was diagnosed with serology , endoscopy , and histopathology in 250 ( 14 %) of all cases undergoing endoscopy. Peptic ulcers<disease> were diagnosed in 74 patients ( 4.2 %) of all cases undergoing endoscopy. tTGA and EMA ( +) levels were determined in 22 ( 29 %) of the 74 patients with peptic ulcers<disease> , and then the presence of peptic ulcers<disease> was investigated in the upper gastrointestinal system using gastrointestinal endoscopy , followed by histopathological confirmation of celiac disease. HP infection was present in 14 ( 63 %) of the patients with celiac disease and in 23 ( 44 %) of non-celiac peptic ulcers<disease>; the difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.12). In the total ulcer<disease> group , 10.8 % ( 8/74) of patients with celiac peptic ulcers<disease> were negative for HP infection , whereas 21 % ( 8/37) of HP-negative patients with ulcers<disease> had celiac disease. There exists a high risk of celiac disease in children with peptic ulcers<disease>. We thus recommend celiac disease to be investigated , particularly in HP-negative patients with peptic ulcers<disease> but with no history of NSAID use.
