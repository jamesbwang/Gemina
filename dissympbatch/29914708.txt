  Parkinson 's disease presents several practical challenges: it can be difficult to distinguish from atypical parkinsonian syndromes<disease> , clinical ratings can be insensitive as markers of disease progression , and its non-motor manifestations are not readily assessed in animal models. These challenges , along with others , are beginning to be addressed by innovative imaging methods to characterise Parkinson 's disease-specific functional networks across the whole brain and measure their expression in each patient. These signatures can help improve differential diagnosis , guide selection of patients for clinical trials , and quantify treatment responses and placebo effects in individual patients. The primary Parkinson 's disease-related metabolic pattern has been replicated in multiple patient populations and used as an outcome measure in clinical trials. It can also be used as a predictor of near-term phenoconversion in prodromal syndromes<disease> , such as rapid eye movement<symptom> sleep behaviour disorder. Functional network imaging holds great promise for future clinical use in the management of neurodegenerative disorders.
