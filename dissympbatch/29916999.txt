  To assess ocular surface disease ( OSD) in glaucoma using clinical parameters , self-report assessment and keratograph analysis. A total of 30 glaucoma patients and 27 subjects with cataracts ( control group) were enrolled in the study. Only glaucoma patients who were using at least 1 topical intraocular pressure ( IOP)- lowering medication were included. An ophthalmological examination was performed , including tear break-up time , assessment of conjunctival hyperemia<symptom> and keratitis<disease> , and completion of the Ocular Surface Disease Index ( OSDI) questionnaire. All the patients underwent keratograph analysis including noninvasive BUT , meibography , tear meniscus height , and redness scale. Quality of life was also assessed in all the patients using NEI VFQ-25. The comparison of OSD between the two groups was assessed. There was a significant difference in OSD: keratitis<disease> and conjunctival hyperemia<symptom> were worse in the glaucoma group ( P = 0.009 and P = 0.008 , respectively). The glaucoma group had significantly worse scores on the OSDI questionnaire ( 32.53 ± 20.75 vs. 20.42 ± 18.77; P = 0.007). For the keratograph assessment , the glaucoma group had significantly smaller tear meniscus height ( 0.22 ± 0.08 vs. 0.24 ± 0.04 , respectively; P = 0.041); worse bulbar redness ( 2.06 ± 0.67 vs. 1.70 ± 0.45 , respectively; P = 0.021); higher meibography grades ( 2.34 ± 1.01 vs. 1.52 ± 0.64 , respectively; P = 0.001); and worse non-invasive keratograph tear BUT ( 5.45 ± 4.16 vs. 8.40 ± 5.65 , respectively; P = 0.023). Patients with glaucoma had a worse quality of life ( 60.73 ± 18.25 vs. 76.62 ± 8.03 , respectively; P = 0.039). Our findings not only confirm the high prevalence of clinical findings of OSD in glaucoma patients but also reveal new objective parameters measured by keratograph analysis.
