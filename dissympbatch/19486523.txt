  For many individuals with Lyme<disease> disease<disease> , prompt treatment leads to rapid resolution of infection. However , severe complications can occur if treatment is delayed. Our objective was to identify themes around belated diagnosis or treatment of Lyme<disease> disease<disease> using the General Model of Total Patient Delay ( GMTPD). We conducted a qualitative interview study using indepth telephone interviews. Participants were patients from a large , integrated health system in the state of Pennsylvania , USA. There were 26 participants. Participants had to have a diagnosis of Lyme<disease> disease<disease> between 2014 and 2017 and a positive IgG western blot. We used a stratified purposeful sampling design to identify patients with and without late Lyme<disease> disease<disease> manifestations. To ensure variation in care experiences , we oversampled patients diagnosed outside of primary care. We asked participants about their experience from first Lyme<disease> disease<disease> symptoms to treatment. We applied an iterative coding process to identify key themes and then synthesised codes into higher order codes representing the GMTPD stages: appraisal delay ( symptom to recognition of illness); illness delay ( inferring illness to deciding to seek help); behavioural delay ( deciding to seek help to the act of seeking help); scheduling delay ( seeking help to attending an appointment); and treatment delay ( attending appointment to treatment). Appraisal delay themes included symptom misattribution , intermittent symptoms and misperceptions about the necessity of a bull 's- eye rash<symptom>. Health insurance status was a driver of illness and behavioural delays. Scheduling delay was not noted by participants , in part , because 10 of the 26 patients went to urgent care or emergency department settings. Misdiagnoses were more common in these settings , contributing to treatment delay. Our study identified potentially modifiable risk factors for belated treatment. Targeting these risk factors may minimise time to treatment and reduce the occurrence of preventable complications.
