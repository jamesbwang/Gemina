  Defects in DNA repair can cause various genetic diseases with severe pathological phenotypes. Fanconi anemia<symptom> ( FA) is a rare disease characterized by bone<disease> marrow failure , developmental abnormalities , and increased cancer risk that is caused by defective repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks ( ICLs). Here , we identify the deubiquitylating enzyme USP48 as synthetic viable for FA-gene deficiencies by performing genome-wide loss-of-function screens across a panel of human haploid isogenic FA-defective cells ( FANCA , FANCC , FANCG , FANCI , FANCD2). Thus , as compared to FA-defective cells alone , FA-deficient cells additionally lacking USP48 are less sensitive to genotoxic stress induced by ICL agents and display enhanced , BRCA1-dependent , clearance of DNA damage. Consequently , USP48 inactivation reduces chromosomal instability of FA-defective cells. Our results highlight a role for USP48 in controlling DNA repair and suggest it as a potential target that could be therapeutically exploited for FA.
