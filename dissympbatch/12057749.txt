  Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome<disease> ( OHSS) is a serious complication of ovulation induction that usually occurs after gonadotropin stimulation , followed by human chorionic gonadotropin administration , for infertility<symptom> treatment. The existing knowledge about the pathophysiology , risk factors , and primary and secondary methods for the prevention of OHSS is reviewed in this manuscript. The clinical manifestations and characteristics of mild , moderate , severe , and critical forms of the syndrome<disease> are defined. The methods of handling affected cases as outpatient or in-hospital management methods as well as indications for hospitalization are summarized in this review. The clinical and biochemical routes of assessing and monitoring hospitalized patients with OHSS , various drugs and medical treatment strategies including indications for aspiration of the ascitic fluid and pleural effusion<symptom> , and also rare indications for surgery are briefly explained in this article. Severe OHSS , which two decades ago was considered an iatrogenic life-threatening condition , can now be effectively prevented or managed during the early stages. An OHSS-free clinic can be established nowadays by carefully considering the endocrinology of ovulation and using appropriate and dose-adjusted pharmaceutical agents , which are summarized and discussed in this review.
