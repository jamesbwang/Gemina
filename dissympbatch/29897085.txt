  Obesity is a risk factor for many chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , and the anti-obesity effect of starch in a whole grain-like structural form ( WGLSF) prepared through co-gelation with oat β-glucan and alginate was studied using high-fat ( HF) induced obese male C57BL/6J mice. In vitro human fecal fermentation of WGLSF-starch showed a slower rate of fermentation and a higher production of butyric acid ( 132.0 μmol per 50 mg sample) when compared to the physical mixture counterpart of starch , β-glucan , and alginate ( PM) ( 110.5 μmol per 50 mg) or β-glucan itself ( 96.2 μmol per 50 mg). The body<symptom> weight gain of obese mice fed with a HF-WGLSF diet was significantly reduced ( 42.0 % lower than the HF group , 30.2 % lower than the physical mixture) with decreased cell size in white adipose tissue and similar levels of serum lipid profiles to the control of the low-fat ( LF) group. Western blotting experiments showed the down-regulated lipogenic transcription factor of SREBP-1c and fatty acid synthase ( FAS) , but the lipid-oxidation related transcription factors of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α ( PPAR-α) and phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase ( p-AMPK) were up-regulated. Energy metabolism analysis revealed increased lipid-sourced energy expenditure with higher heat production and respiratory exchange ratios. Consistently , the expression of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin ( POMC) , favoring energy expenditure , was increased significantly while the neuropeptide Y ( NPY) was reduced. Thus , the increased energy expenditure stimulated by starch in a whole-grain-like structural form is responsible for the reduced body<symptom> weight gain of obese mice fed with a high fat-based diet.
