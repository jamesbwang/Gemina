  Lower urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS) are a common complaint in the general population with great impact on the quality of life.

The blood and urine tests only revealed increased systemic inflammatory parameters. The ultrasound examination showed thickening of the bladder wall , and the CT scan revealed a retropubic abscess<disease> originating from a pubic symphysis osteomyelitis<disease> A percutaneous drainage was performed and , after empirical antibiotic therapy , there was complete resolution of the clinical picture.
