  Use of the subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( S-ICD) to prevent sudden cardiac death is increasing. Few data exist on S-ICD in young patients. We reviewed our single-centre experience in order to assess the effectiveness and safety of S-ICD implantation , and to identify potential factors associated with complications. Observational , non-randomized , standard-of-care study on S-ICD implantation/follow-up in young patients with inherited arrhythmias ( IA) , cardiomyopathies , and congenital heart defects ( CHD). Fifteen patients ( 6 CHD , 8 cardiomyopathies , and 1 IA) , median age 15 years ( 25th-75th centiles , 14-28) , 10 of them < 18 years , with body mass index ( BMI) 22.6 Â± 3.4 , underwent S-ICD implantation ( primary prevention 93 %). The first six patients underwent a standard implantation procedure ( three surgical incisions) , the following nine a two-incision procedure. No intraoperative complications occurred. Over 12 ( 7-24) months follow-up , two patients received appropriate shocks<disease> and one ( 7 %) inappropriate shock<symptom>. Four patients had device-related complications requiring surgical intervention: three skin erosions at the superior parasternal incision , one pocket infection. A higher risk of complications was seen in patients who underwent standard procedures ( hazard ratio ( HR) 4.98 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.53-47.36; P = 0.0482) and those with BMI < 20 ( HR 9.44 , 95 % CI 0.95-93.23; P = 0.0169). S-ICD implantation was safe and effective in young patients with low rates of inappropriate shock<symptom>. However , the risk of device-related complications during follow-up remains substantial in patients with low BMI. To prevent possible complications , a two-incision technique should be preferred.
