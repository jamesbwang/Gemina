  Lower gastrointestinal symptoms are not well characterized in people with type 1 diabetes , and the effects on quality of life and glycemic control are unknown. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of lower gastrointestinal symptoms and the effects on glycemic control and quality of life , and to investigate for underlying causes. This is a prospective , cohort study in secondary care. Patients with type 1 diabetes completed a gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire and the Short Form 36 V. 2 quality of life questionnaire and had their hemoglobin A1c measured. Patients with diarrhea<disease> were offered reassessment and investigation as per the national guidelines. Controls without diabetes were used to compare symptom prevalence and quality of life scores. 706 with type 1 diabetes ( mean age 41.9 years) and 604 controls ( mean age 41.9 years) were enrolled. Gastrointestinal symptoms were significantly more frequent in type 1 diabetes compared with controls , in particular constipation<symptom> ( OR 2.4) , diarrhea<disease> ( OR 2.5) , alternating bowel habit ( OR 2.1) , abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> ( OR 1.4) , floating stools<symptom> ( OR 2.7) , bloating ( OR 1.4) and flatulence<symptom> ( OR 1.3) ( all p < 0.05). Previous pancreatitis<disease> was more frequent in type 1 diabetes ( OR 4.6) , but other gastrointestinal conditions were not. Gastrointestinal symptoms were associated with poorer glycemic control ( p < 0.01) and worse quality of life particularly in those with diarrhea<disease> Investigation of those with diarrhea<disease> , including those with alternating bowel habit , ( n = 105) , identified a cause in 72.3 % with subsequent change in management. Gastrointestinal symptoms are twice as common in type 1 diabetes and associated with poorer quality of life and glycemic control. Investigation of diarrhea<disease> in people with type 1 diabetes leads to a high yield of treatable conditions and a change in management in about three-quarters.
