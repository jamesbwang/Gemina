  Type A aortic dissection can present with malperfusion syndrome<disease>. Lower limb ischaemia may resolve with repair of the dissection; however , the long duration of repair and/or persistent ischaemia may leave tissue at risk of necrosis<symptom> with potential for substantial morbidity. Here , the case of a 67 year old man who presented with a Type A aortic dissection with malperfusion of the lower extremities is described. The Vascular Surgery and Cardiac Surgery divisions were consulted simultaneously. A decision was made to perform bilateral superficial femoral artery cannulation with perfusion initially via the right axillary artery prior to sternotomy , then via the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. At completion of the arch replacement , lower extremity inflow was reassessed with formal repair of the femoral arteries. Post-operatively , the patient had complete return of motor-sensory function , despite densely ischaemic symptoms at presentation several hours previously. Cannulation of the superficial femoral arteries serves as a means to limit limb ischaemia intra-operatively and potentially improve outcomes in the setting of Type A aortic dissection with lower extremity malperfusion.
