  Though the incidence of complications and adverse events with dermatological fillers is inherently low , practitioners should be well versed in both prevention of filler complications and the treatment algorithms for addressing `` granulomas<disease> , '' nodules<symptom> , infection , and vascular compromise. Appropriate preventative measures , coupled with timely and effective treatment , are critically important for patient safety and satisfaction. In addition to the preventive measures and treatment algorithms outlined here , the authors emphasize that the broad classification and treatment of nodules<symptom> as `` granulomas<disease> '' is likely to lead to ineffective treatment , or worse , unnecessary exposure to incorrect treatment. In practice , nodules<symptom> are classified and treated based on clinical manifestation ( eg , late vs early or noninflammatory vs inflammatory) rather than on histology. Indeed , classification of a nodule<disease> as a granuloma<disease> requires a histological examination , rarely available ( or necessary) in clinical practice to guide treatment. Thus , the apparent inflammatory nature of the nodule<disease> and the time of onset should drive treatment approach. The treatment algorithms presented here are based on these clinically meaningful parameters.
