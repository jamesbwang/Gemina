  Although hundreds of genes have been linked to chronic myelogenous leukemia<disease> ( CML) , many of the results lack reproducibility. In the present study , data across multiple modalities were integrated to evaluate 579 CML candidate genes , including literature‑based CML‑gene relation data , Gene Expression Omnibus RNA expression data and pathway‑based gene‑gene interaction data. The expression data included samples from 76 patients with CML and 73 healthy controls. For each target gene , four metrics were proposed and tested with case/control classification. The effectiveness of the four metrics presented was demonstrated by the high classification accuracy ( 94.63 %; P < 2x10‑4). Cross metric analysis suggested nine top candidate genes for CML: Epidermal growth factor receptor , tumor protein p53 , catenin β 1 , janus kinase 2 , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor , abelson murine leukemia<disease> viral oncogene homolog 1 , vascular endothelial growth factor A , B‑cell lymphoma 2 and proto‑oncogene tyrosine‑protein kinase. In addition , 145 CML candidate pathways enriched with 485 out of 579 genes were identified ( P < 8.2 x10‑11; q = 0.005). In conclusion , weighted genetic networks generated using computational biology may be complementary to biological experiments for the evaluation of known or novel CML target genes.
