  To examine the efficacy and safety of lubiprostone for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation<symptom> ( OIC) in patients by opioid class received. Data were pooled from three phase III , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled studies. Adults with chronic noncancer pain receiving opioid therapy for 30 or more days and diagnosed with OIC. Overall mean change from baseline in spontaneous bowel movement ( SBM) frequency , overall treatment response ( ≥ 1 SBM/week improvement over baseline SBM frequency in all treatment weeks with available data and ≥ 3 SBMs/week for ≥ 9 of the 12 weeks of treatment) , and OIC-related symptoms were examined in patients taking opioids. Data were pooled and analyzed by opioid group. In patients receiving phenanthrene opioids ( e.g. , oxycodone; N = 1,159) , lubiprostone significantly increased overall mean changes in SBM frequency from baseline ( P = 0.0001) , increased overall response rate ( P = 0.0024) , and improved OIC symptoms ( P ≤ 0.0229) vs placebo. Patients receiving phenylpiperidine opioids ( e.g. , fentanyl; N = 137) had significant improvement in SBM frequency ( P = 0.0129) and favorable trends in response rates ( 21.4 % vs 9.8 %; P = 0.0723) and OIC symptoms vs placebo. Efficacy was not observed in overall analyses of patients receiving diphenylheptane opioids ( e.g. , methadone) , although an increase in SBM frequency was observed in patients who received a morphine-equivalent daily dose of 200 or fewer mg , suggesting a dose-dependent negative interference of this opioid class on lubiprostone effects. For all groups , the lubiprostone adverse event profile was similar; the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea<symptom> and diarrhea<disease> In patients using commonly prescribed opioids , lubiprostone is effective and generally well tolerated for the treatment of OIC.
