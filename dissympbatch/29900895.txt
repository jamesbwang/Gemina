  Tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) programs should design intervention strategies based on the sound knowledge of the existing local epidemiology and sociodemographic characteristics of drug-resistant-TB ( DR-TB) cases. The aim of the study was to characterize the pulmonary multidrug-resistant ( MDR) and rifampicin-resistant ( RR) TB cases enrolled in a referral hospital at Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , called All Africa Leprosy<disease> , Tuberculosis<disease> , Rehabilitation and Training ( ALERT) Hospital. We conducted a descriptive study based on retrospective review of medical records of 340 pulmonary MDR/RR-TB cases enrolled in ALERT Hospital from November 2011 to December 2016. To characterize the cases , we described the distribution of demographic and clinical characteristics. To compare the distribution of demographic and clinical characteristics between male and female cases , we used Pearson 's Chi-squared test. Males accounted for 52.9 % of the 340 cases. Nine out of ten cases were in the age group of 15-44 years. Sputum<symptom> acid-fast bacilli smear-positive and human immunodeficiency virus-coinfected cases constituted 63.7 % and 18.1 % of cases , respectively. The proportion of new cases increased through the years from nil in 2011 to 21.4 % in 2016. Adult males above 24 years constituted more than three quarters ( 77.2 %) of the total male cases , while adult females in this age group constituted 56.9 %. The age distribution between male and female cases showed significant differences ( P < 0.001). There is age disparity between male and female cases with high impact of MDR/RR-TB on productive adult male population. The transmission potential for DR-TB is also high in the community.
