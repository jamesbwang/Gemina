  Diverticulosis of the colon is a common condition , and about one-fourth of those people develop symptoms , which is called ` diverticular disease ' ( DD). Since there are still some concerns about the diagnosis of DD , the aim of this review was to analyze current and evolving advances in its diagnosis. Area covered: Analysis of clinical , radiology , laboratory , and endoscopic tools to pose a correct diagnosis of DD was performed according to current PubMed literature. Expert commentary: A combination of clinical characteristic of the abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and fecal calprotectin expression may help to differentiate between symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and irritable bowel syndrome<disease>. Abdominal computerized tomography ( CT) scan is still the gold standard in diagnosing acute diverticulitis and its complications. CT-colonography may be useful as a predicting tool on the outcome of the disease. Diverticular Inflammation<symptom> and Complications Assessment ( DICA) endoscopic classification shows a significant relationship between severity of DICA score inflammatory indexes , as well as with severity of abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> Moreover , it seems to be predictive of the outcome of the disease in terms of acute diverticulitis occurrence/recurrence and surgery occurrence. Finally , preliminary data found intestinal microbiota analysis is a promising tool in diagnosing and monitoring this disease.
