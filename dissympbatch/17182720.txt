  Leiomyomas are benign mesenchymal tumors , the overwhelming majority of which are located in the uterus. Rare cases arise in other organs , including the scrotum , pelvis , bladder , and spermatic cord. This report evaluates the case of a 37-year-old man with a history of prior left inguinal hernia repair , who presented with a painless right scrotal mass. He first noticed the mass approximately 1 year prior to his initial visit. Subsequent ultrasound of the scrotum demonstrated a 5-cm circumscribed , hypoechoic , mildly vascular extratesticular mass located within the right hemiscrotum. Based on the initial imaging , the differential diagnosis included lipoma , adenomatoid tumor , papillary cystadenoma , leiomyoma , fibrous pseudotumor , sarcoid granuloma<disease> , sarcoma<disease> ( including liposarcoma , rhabdosarcoma , or leiomyosarcoma) , lymphoma , and an extranumerary testis. The mass had circumscribed margins , suggesting an encapsulated lesion<symptom> , and was completely separate from the testicle on ultrasound. Despite this , testicular malignancy was not entirely excluded as a diagnosis , although it was considered far less likely. The patient was definitively treated with surgical excision of the mass. Pathology of the surgical specimen confirmed diagnosis of leiomyoma , a rare scrotal mass.
