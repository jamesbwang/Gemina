  Age-related bone loss is associated with bone<disease> marrow adiposity. Adipokines ( e.g. , visfatin , resistin , leptin) are adipocyte-derived factors with immunomodulatory properties and might influence differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( MSC) in osteoarthritis ( OA) and osteoporosis ( OP). Thus , the presence of adipokines and MMPs in bone<disease> marrow and their effects on MSC differentiation were analyzed. MSC and Ribonucleic acid ( RNA) were isolated from femoral heads after hip replacement surgery of OA or osteoporotic femoral neck fracture ( FF) patients. Bone structural parameters were evaluated by Microcomputed tomography ( μCT). MSC were differentiated towards adipocytes or osteoblasts with/without adipokines. Gene expression ( adipokines , bone marker genes , MMPs , TIMPs) and cytokine production was evaluated by realtime-Polymerase chain reaction ( realtime-PCR) and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). Matrix mineralization was quantified using Alizarin red S staining. μCT showed an osteoporotic phenotype of FF compared to OA bone ( reduced trabecular thickness and increased ratio of bone surface vs volume of solid bone). Visfatin and leptin were increased in FF vs OA. Visfatin induced the secretion of IL-6 , IL-8 , and MCP-1 during osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. In contrast to resistin and leptin , visfatin increased MMP2 and MMP13 during Adipogenesis. In osteogenically differentiated cells , MMPs and TIMPs were reduced by visfatin. Visfatin significantly increased matrix mineralization during osteogenesis , whereas collagen type I expression was reduced. Visfatin-mediated increase of matrix mineralization and reduced collagen type I expression could contribute to bone fragility. Visfatin is involved in impaired bone remodeling at the adipose tissue/bone interface through induction of proinflammatory factors and dysregulated MMP/TIMP balance<symptom> during MSC differentiation.
