  Flos Lonicerae Japonica-Fructus Forsythiae herb pair ( Yin-Qiao in Chinese , YQ) , is used clinically for the treatment of viral pneumonia<disease> due to its heat-clearing and detoxifying functions. In the present work , the effect of YQ in H1N1-induced inflammation<symptom> in mice was investigated by metabolomics based on GC-MS. Body<symptom> weight and histological results were used to assess the lung injury , while the levels of IL-6 and TNF-Î± in plasma were used to evaluate the extent of inflammation<symptom>. The acquired GC-MS data were further subjected to multivariate data analysis , and the significantly altered metabolites identified. After statistical and pathway analysis , 17 significantly altered metabolites and 3 possible metabolic pathways were found in plasma between normal and H1N1-induced pneumonia<disease> mice , while 17 significant differential metabolites were identified when YQ treatment group was compared with model group. This work indicates that oral administration of YQ could protect mice from H1N1-induced inflammation<symptom> partially by ameliorating the associated metabolic disturbances.
