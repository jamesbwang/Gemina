  Acute pancreatitis<disease> ( AP) , a human<disease> disease<disease> in which the pancreas digests itself , has substantial mortality with no specific therapy. The major causes of AP are alcohol abuse and gallstone complications , but it also occurs as an important side effect of the standard asparaginase-based therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease>. Previous investigations into the mechanisms underlying pancreatic acinar cell death induced by alcohol metabolites , bile acids , or asparaginase indicated that loss of intracellular ATP generation is an important factor. We now report that , in isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells or cell clusters , removal of extracellular glucose had little effect on this ATP loss , suggesting that glucose metabolism was severely inhibited under these conditions. Surprisingly , we show that replacing glucose with galactose prevented or markedly reduced the loss of ATP and any subsequent necrosis<symptom>. Addition of pyruvate had a similar protective effect. We also studied the effect of galactose in vivo in mouse models of AP induced either by a combination of fatty acids and ethanol or asparaginase. In both cases , galactose markedly reduced acinar necrosis<symptom> and inflammation<symptom>. Based on these data , we suggest that galactose feeding may be used to protect against AP.
