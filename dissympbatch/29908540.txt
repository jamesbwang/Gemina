  The exact role of fractional exhaled nitric oxide ( FeNO) in older patients with chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> including asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) overlap ( ACO) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the differences in FeNO levels of elderly patients with ACO , asthma , COPD , and chronic<symptom> cough<symptom>. We conducted a retrospective study analysing the data of stable outpatients from Pulmonary Department of the Second Clinical College , Jinan University. All participants ( Age ≥ 55 years) were divided into the ACO group ( n = 19) , asthma group ( n = 16) , COPD group ( n = 25) , and chronic<symptom> cough<symptom> group ( n = 22). The clinical data such as peripheral eosinophil counts , serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP) , FeNO , and spirometry was collected , and the correlations between FeNO levels and systemic markers or spirometric indices were analyzed. Patients with ACO and asthma had significantly elevated FeNO levels ( 37.7 ± 16.5 , and 36.3 ± 17.7 ppb) compared with COPD , and chronic<symptom> cough<symptom> patients ( 21.9 ± 10.3 , and 16.1 ± 8.8 ppb). The FeNO levels were negatively associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 , p = 0.003) , FEV1 % predicted ( p = 0.012) , and FEV1/forced vital capacity ( FVC , p = 0.002) in all groups. However , there were no significant correlation between FeNO levels and FVC , peripheral eosinophil counts , or serum hs-CRP ( p > 0.05). Elderly patients with ACO have higher levels of FeNO , when compared with patients with COPD or chronic<symptom> cough<symptom>. These findings suggest that FeNO measurement may provide an important implication for the etiological diagnosis of ACO in the elderly patients.
