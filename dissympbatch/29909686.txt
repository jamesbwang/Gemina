  Abundant expression of proinflammatory cytokines after a spinal cord injury ( SCI) creates an inhibitory microenvironment for neuroregeneration. The mesenchymal stem cells help to mitigate the inflammation<symptom> and improve neural growth and survival. For this purpose , we potentiated the function of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( Ad-MSCs) by transfecting them with brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) and heme oxygenase-1 ( HO-1) , through a lentivirus , to produce BDNF overexpressed Ad-MSCs ( BDNF-MSCs) , and HO-1 overexpressed Ad-MSCs ( HO-1-MSCs). Sixteen SCI beagle dogs were randomly assigned into four treatment groups. We injected both HO-1 and BDNF-overexpressed MSCs as a combination group , to selectively control inflammation<symptom> and induce neuroregeneration in SCI dogs , and compared this with BDNF-MSCs , HO-1-MSCs , and GFP-MSCs injected dogs. The groups were compared in terms of improvement in canine Basso , Beattie , and Bresnahan ( cBBB) score during 8 weeks of experimentation. After 8 weeks , spinal<disease> cords<disease> were harvested and subjected to western blot analysis , immunofluorescent staining , and hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E) staining. The combination group showed a significant improvement in hindlimb functions , with a higher BBB score , and a robust increase in neuroregeneration , depicted by a higher expression of Tuj-1 , NF-M , and GAP-43 due to a decreased expression of the inflammatory markers interleukin-6 ( IL-6) and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) , and an increased expression of interleukin-10 ( IL-10) ( P ≤ 0.05). H&E staining showed more reduced intraparenchymal fibrosis<disease> in the combination group than in other groups ( P ≤ 0.05). It was thus suggested that the cotransplantation of HO-1 and BDNF-MSCs is more effective in promoting the healing of SCI. HO-1-MSCs reduce inflammation<symptom> , which favors BDNF-induced neuroregeneration in SCI of dogs.
