  After initial infection , the immune response that serves to restrict the invading pathogen needs to be tightly calibrated in order to avoid collateral immunopathological damage. This calibration is performed by specialized suppressor mechanisms , which are capable of dampening overwhelming or unremitting inflammation<symptom> in order to prevent tissue damage. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSC) are emerging as key players in counter-balancing inflammatory responses and pathogenesis during infection. However , some pathogens are able to exploit the suppressive activities of MDSC to favor pathogen persistence and chronic<disease> infections<disease>. In this article , we review the current knowledge about the importance of MDSC in the context of bacterial , virus , parasites , and fungal infections.
