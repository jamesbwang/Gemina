  With the goal to explore a new approach to treat the early degenerative lesions<symptom> of hyaline cartilage , we implanted in a porcine OA model a collagen-based scaffold containing chondroprogenitor cells derived from human bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( hBM-MSCs). Porcine knee joints were subjected to anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL) transection to surgically induce OA. After 4 months , the time necessary for the development of cartilage surface damage , animals were treated either with trephination bone plug wrapped with the chondroprogenic hBM-MSCs-embedded collagen scaffold or microfractures alone. Histological and histomorphometric evaluations were performed at 5 months after surgery. All animals subjected to ACL transection showed osteoarthritic changes including mild lateral femoral condyle or moderate medial femoral condyle ulcerations. After 14 days ' chondrogenic induction , hBM-MSCs seeded onto the scaffold showed expression of chondroprogenitor markers such as SOX9 and COMP. At 5 months after the implantation , significant differences in the quality of the regenerated tissue were found between the hBM-MSCs-embedded scaffold group and the control group. Newly generated tissue was only observed at the site of implantation with the hBM-MSCs-embedded scaffolds. Furthermore , histological examination of the generated tissue revealed evidence of cartilage-like tissue with lacuna formation. In contrast , fibrous layers or fissures were formed on the surface of the control knee joint. This study shows that xenogenic hBM-MSC derived chondroprogenitor scaffolds can generate new cartilage tissue in porcine articular cartilage and have the potential as a useful treatment option for osteoarthritis.
