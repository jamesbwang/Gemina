  Tetrahydrocurcumin ( THC) also referred to as ` white curcumin ' , is a stable colorless hydrogenated product of curcumin with superior antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The present study is an attempt to elevate the topical bioavailability of THC , post-incorporation into a nano-carrier system with its final dosage as a hydrogel. Lipid nanoparticles of THC ( THC-SLNs) prepared by microemulsification technique were ellipsoidal in shape ( revealed in transmission electron microscopy) with a mean particle size of 96.6 nm and zeta potential of -22 mV. Total drug content and entrapment efficiency of THC-SLNs was 94.51 % ± 2.15 % and 69.56 % ± 1.35 % , respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the formation of THC-SLNs. In vitro drug release studies showed the drug release from THC-SLNs gel to follow Higuchi 's equation revealing a Fickian diffusion. Ex vivo permeation studies indicated a 17 times ( approximately) higher skin permeation of THC-SLNs gel as compared with the free THC gel. Skin irritation , occlusion , and stability studies indicated the formulation to be nonirritating , and stable with a desired occlusivity. Pharmacodynamic evaluation in an excision wound<disease> mice model clearly revealed the enhanced anti-inflammatory activity of THC-SLNs gel and was further confirmed using biochemical and histopathological studies. It is noteworthy to report here that THC-SLNs gel showed significantly better ( p ≤ 0.001) activity than free THC in gel. As inflammation<symptom> is innate to all the skin disorders , the developed product opens up new therapeutic avenues for several skin diseases. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first paper elaborating the therapeutic usefulness of white curcumin-loaded lipidic nanoparticles for
