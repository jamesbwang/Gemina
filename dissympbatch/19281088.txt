  Data regarding the use of noninvasive ventilation ( NIV) for treatment of acute<disease> respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> ( ARF) among patients with noncystic fibrosis<disease> ( CF) bronchiectasis are limited. We intend to describe our experience with NIV use in this setting. This was a retrospective study which included 99 patients with bronchiectasis and ARF who required either NIV or invasive mechanical ventilation ( IMV). NIV was started as the primary modality of ventilatory support in 81 ( 66.3 %) patients. Fifty-three ( 65.4 %) patients were managed successfully with NIV. Twenty-eight ( 34.56 %) patients failed NIV and required endotracheal intubation. Reasons for NIV failure were worsening or nonimprovement of ventilatory or oxygenation parameters ( NIV is feasible for management of ARF with non-CF bronchiectasis. High APACHE may predict NIV failure among these patients.
