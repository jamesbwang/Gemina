  Severe sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom> are among the leading causes of death globally. Despite the central role the emergency department ( ED) plays in the early identification of patients presenting to hospital with sepsis<disease> , the prevalence of severe sepsis<disease> and septic shock<symptom> in the Irish ED setting has not been described. The primary aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of severe sepsis<disease> or septic shock<symptom> in an Irish adult ED setting. The clinical records of patients presenting to the ED over a four-week period were retrospectively reviewed to determine if they met the current Health Service Executive ( HSE) criteria for severe sepsis<disease> or septic shock<symptom>. Overall , 3,585 adult patients attended the ED during the study period , with 42 patients meeting the criteria for severe sepsis<disease> or septic shock<symptom>. The ED prevalence of severe sepsis<disease> or septic shock<symptom> was 11.7 patients ( 95 % CI 8.1- 15.4 %) per 1000 ED attendances.
