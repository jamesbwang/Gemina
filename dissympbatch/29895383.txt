  SLC13A5-related epileptic encephalopathy is a recently described autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by infantile epilepsy and developmental delay. Seizures<symptom> are markedly drug resistant and often induced by fever<disease> they mainly occur in clusters , sometimes evolving into status epilepticus. We report the use of stiripentol as an adjunctive therapy in three siblings with drug-resistant SLC13A5-related epilepsy. The three patients showed remarkable improvement in the severity and frequency of seizures<symptom> , status epilepticus , emergency department visits , and alertness. These observations extend the use of stiripentol beyond the classical Dravet syndrome<disease> , and further studies on the use of this drug in drug-resistant epilepsy , mainly of genetic origin , are warranted.
