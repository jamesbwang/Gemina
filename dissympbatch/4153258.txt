  Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile disease with mucocutaneous and cardiovascular involvement affecting infants and young children. Though coronary artery abnormalities are common in Kawasaki disease , no consensus has been reached regarding the treatment of acute coronary artery diseases in this population. We described a case of myocardial infarction triggered by blunt chest wall trauma in a 20 years old girl. She presented with chest<symptom> pain<symptom> and breathlessness with brief syncope , lab results and electrocardiogram findings were consistent with acute myocardial infarction. Chest computer tomography ( CT) demonstrated coronary artery calcifications and echocardiography revealed multiple giant left anterior descending aneurysms<disease> , suggestive of Kawasaki disease. Subsequent contrast enhanced 3 dimensional coronary computer tomography angiography ( CTA) confirmed these findings. We managed this young patient with a conservative strategy. The patient remained symptom free during 2-years follow-ups. Prompt medical treatment for traumatic myocardial infarction even with underlying giant coronary artery aneurysms<disease> can successfully preserve left ventricular function and prevent remodeling with good short term prognosis.
