  Inhalation of sulfur dioxide ( SO Female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to SO Both treatment approaches significantly reduced the total leukocyte response in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and suppressed pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom>. In contrast to DEX-treatment , PFD-treatment reduced the methacholine-induced AHR to almost control levels and partially suppressed the acute mucosal damage whereas multiple DEX-treatment was the only treatment that reduced collagen formation in lung tissue. To enable an accurate extrapolation of animal derived data to humans , a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the injury , and potential treatment options , is needed. The findings of the present study suggest that treatments with the capability to reduce both AHR , the inflammatory response , and fibrosis<disease> are needed to achieve a comprehensive mitigation of the acute lung injury caused by SO
