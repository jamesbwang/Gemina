  Toll-like receptors ( TLR) 2 and 4 are active in sebaceous glands and play a central role in the development of acne. Still , there is only limited knowledge on their effect on sebocytes. In this work we performed global gene expression profile analysis with functional clustering of the differentially regulated genes of TLR1/2 ( PAM3CSK4)- and TLR4 ( lipopolysaccharide ( LPS))- activated SZ95 sebocytes. Both TLR1/2- and 4-activation promoted inflammation<symptom> in a similar manner already at an early time-point ( 6 hours) , regulating genes involved in inflammation<symptom> , wound<disease> healing and chemotaxis reflecting a more complex cytokine and chemokine regulation than previously known. Importantly , lipid metabolism , the primary feature of sebocytes , was affected at the level of gene expression only at a later time point ( 24 hours) indicating that sebocytes prioritize to exert a pro-inflammatory phenotype when confronted with a danger signal. Supporting the biological relevance of our results , a meta-analysis revealed that the genes showing the strongest up-regulation were also found up-regulated in acne. Of these genes , serum amyloid A 1/2 ( SAA1/2) was confirmed to be a suitable protein marker for in vivo activated sebocytes , underlining their immune-competence , which is structurally defined within sebaceous glands of acne and rosacea skin samples. Altogether our findings demonstrate that sebocytes are not only positioned at the end point of inflammation<symptom> but are actively involved in shaping the inflammatory response with putative diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.
