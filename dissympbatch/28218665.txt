  Periodontitis<disease> is an inflammatory autoimmune disease. Treatment should alleviate inflammation<symptom> , regulate the immune reaction and promote periodontal tissue regeneration. Icariin is the main active ingredient of Epimedii Folium , and it is a promising compound for the enhancement of mesenchymal stem cell function , promotion of bone formation , inhibition of bone resorption , alleviation of inflammation<symptom> and regulation of immunity. The study investigated the effect of icariin on periodontal tissue regeneration in a minipig model of periodontitis<disease> The minipig model of periodontitis<disease> was established. Icariin was injected locally. The periodontal clinical assessment index , a computed tomography ( CT) scan , histopathology and enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay ( ELISA) were used to evaluate the effects of icariin. Quantitative analysis results 12 weeks post-injection demonstrated that probing depth , gingival recession , attachment loss and alveolar bone regeneration values were ( 3.72 ± 1.18) mm vs. ( 6.56 ± 1.47) mm , ( 1.67 ± 0.59) mm vs. ( 2.38 ± 0.61) mm , ( 5.56 ± 1.29) mm vs. ( 8.61 ± 1.72) mm , and ( 25.65 ± 5.13) mm
