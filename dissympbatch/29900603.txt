  Whilst severe asthma has classically been categorized as a predominantly Th2-driven pathology , there has in recent years been a paradigm shift with the realization that it is a heterogeneous disease that may manifest with quite disparate underlying inflammatory and remodelling profiles. A subset of asthmatics , particularly those with a severe , corticosteroid refractory disease , present with a prominent neutrophilic component. Given the potential of neutrophils to impart extensive tissue damage and promote inflammation<symptom> , it has been anticipated that these cells are closely implicated in the underlying pathophysiology of severe asthma. However , uncertainty persists as to why the neutrophil is present in the asthmatic lung and what precisely it is doing there , with evidence supporting its role as a protagonist of pathology being primarily circumstantial. Furthermore , our view of the neutrophil as a primitive , indiscriminate killer has evolved with the realization that neutrophils can exhibit a marked anti-inflammatory , pro-resolving and wound<disease> healing capacity. We suggest that the neutrophil likely exhibits pleiotropic and potentially conflicting roles in defining asthma pathophysiology-some almost certainly detrimental and some potentially beneficial-with context , timing and location all critical confounders. Accordingly , indiscriminate blockade of neutrophils with a broad sword approach is unlikely to be the answer , but rather we should first seek to understand their complex and multifaceted roles in the disease state and then target them with the same subtleties and specificity that they themselves exhibit.
