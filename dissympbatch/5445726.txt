  Trapeziectomy with interpositional arthroplasty using Repriza acellular dermal matrix is a novel technique to treat primary and secondary carpometacarpal joint<symptom> arthritis<disease>. Early studies with nonautograft interposition indicate promising post-trapeziectomy space maintenance with results similar to ligament reconstruction with tendon interposition , without the potential risks and increased operating time of harvesting a tendon autograft. Eleven patients in a retrospective cohort were followed for a minimum of 6 weeks ( mean , 12). Subjective and objective data were collected to assess pain , subjective improvement of symptoms , radiographic measurements of first metacarpal subsidence , key pinch strength , grip strength , and range of motion. Early outcomes in our cohort compare favorably to other treatment series. On average , patients received a significant pain reduction of 63 % , with 36 % of patients admitting to complete pain resolution. One hundred percentage of patients admitted to overall subjective improvement in symptoms. Ninety-one percentage of patients achieved postoperative opposition of the thumb and fifth digit. Comparison with preoperative x-rays showed mean thumb metacarpal subsidence of 27 %. Zigzag deformity and extra-articular acellular dermal matrix migration , due to lack of patient compliance with splint , were observed complications. Only 8.3 % subsidence was observed with an impressive 45 % pain reduction , in a salvage patient after revision surgery for a NuGrip implant. In conclusion , this is a safe and effective primary or salvage technique for Eaton grades III and IV thumb carpometacarpal arthritis<disease> with a mean subsidence within the range observed with ligament reconstruction with or without tendon interposition. Long-term study with a larger sample size is needed to investigate this technique further.
