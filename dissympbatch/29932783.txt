  The review aims to discuss the prominence of dietary and metabolic regulators in maintaining HSC function , long-term self-renewal and differentiation. Most adult stem cells are preserved in a quiescent , non-motile state in vivo which acts as a `` protective state '' for stem cells to reduce endogenous stress provoked by DNA replication and cellular respiration<symptom> as well as exogenous environmental stress. The dynamic balance<symptom> between quiescence , self-renewal and differentiation is critical for supporting a functional blood system throughout life of an organism. Stress-conditions , e.g. ionizing radiation exposure can trigger the blood forming hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs) to proliferate and migrate through extramedullary tissues to expand the number of HSCs and increase hematopoiesis. In addition , a wealth of investigation validated that deregulation of this balance<symptom> plays a critical pathogenic role in various different hematopoietic diseases including the leukemia<disease> development. The review summarises the current knowledge on how alterations in dietary and metabolic factors could alter the risk of leukemia<disease> development following ionizing radiation exposure by inhibiting or even reversing the leukemic progression. Understanding the influence of diet , metabolism and epigenetics on radiation-induced leukemogenesis may lead to the development of practical interventions to reduce the risk in exposed populations.
