  We present an unusual case of cystic pilomatricoma. A 13-year-old Japanese boy was referred to our department for evaluation of a 10-day history of a small reddish nodule<disease> on his right cheek. Histopathological examination showed a well-circumscribed cystic structure showing a central empty cavity in the dermis. The wall of the cyst<symptom> was composed of basophilic cells. Inner layers of the wall were covered with flattened epithelial cells having trichohyalin granules. Based on these findings , a diagnosis of cystic pilomatricoma was made. To our knowledge , there has been no report of cystic pilomatricoma with an empty cavity. Dermatologists should be aware of pilomatricoma in the early stage showing a central empty cavity.
