  Uveitis is defined as a collection of syndromes<disease> involving intraocular inflammation<symptom> which can lead to pain , tissue damage , and vision loss<symptom>. Ophthalmic surgery in uveitis patients can be challenging due to inflammation-induced fibrosis<disease> and scarring. Trabeculectomy and implantation of glaucoma drainage devices ( aqueous shunts) have been used in surgical management of uveitic glaucoma , however there is a paucity of literature examining the comparative results of these entities in this unique setting. The purpose of this retrospective comparative study is to compare clinical outcomes of trabeculectomy with MMC , Ahmed shunt , and Baerveldt shunt surgery specifically in uveitic glaucoma. Median IOP , IOP reduction , glaucoma medication use , and visual acuity at 6- and 12-month follow-up were similar across groups. Postoperative hypotony rate was significantly different across trabeculectomy ( 53 %) , Baerveldt ( 24 %) , and Ahmed ( 18 %) groups ( p = 0.027); other complication rates were similar. Baerveldt eyes had a lower failure rate compared to trabeculectomy ( p = 0.0054) and Ahmed ( p = 0.0008) eyes. While there was no difference in IOP reduction between trabeculectomy , Ahmed , and Baerveldt , Baerveldt eyes had the lowest failure rate.
