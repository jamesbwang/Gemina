  The purpose of the present study was to screen for differentially expressed proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) of patients with Guillain-Barr√© syndrome<disease> ( GBS). The identification of differentially expressed protein can provide new targets for understanding the pathogenic mechanism , early clinical diagnosis , prognosis and for measuring the effectiveness of interventions. We enrolled 50 GBS patients and 50 meningitis<disease> patients ( control group) to compare protein expression in CSF. The GBS cases included 28 cases of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ( AIDP) and 22 cases of acute motor axonal neuropathy ( AMAN). We then performed two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify the differentially expressed proteins. The expression levels were validated by ELISA , and their accuracy , sensitivity , and specificity in GBS diagnosis were analyzed by the receiver operating characteristic curve. Three differentially expressed proteins were identified , including the upregulated haptoglobin ( Hp) and heat shock<symptom> protein 70 ( Hsp70) , and downregulated cystatin C. There were no significant differences between the AIDP and AMAN patients in the positive rates and quantitative expression levels of the three differentially expressed proteins. The accuracy of Hp in the diagnosis of GBS was 0.835 , sensitivity was 86.7 % , and specificity was 88.2 %. The accuracy of cystatin C in the diagnosis of GBS was 0.827 , sensitivity was 85.5 % , and specificity was 89.7 %. The accuracy of Hsp70 in the diagnosis of GBS was 0.841 , its sensitivity was 87.8 % , and its specificity was 92.3 %. Hp and Hsp70 are significantly increased , and cystatin C is downregulated in CSF of GBS patients , which provides important biomarkers for early GBS diagnosis , although these proteins can not distinguish AIDP and AMAN.
