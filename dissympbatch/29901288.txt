  To investigate the role of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the management of patients with radiation induced urinary bladder injury ( radiation cystitis<disease> The study comprised 23 patients with late radiation induced urinary bladder injury who were evaluated and treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy and bladder instillation. Before and after treatment , all patients underwent cystoscopy with the bladder mucosa biopsy. In all patients , the treatment resulted in positive outcomes manifested by resolution of hematuria<symptom> , alleviation of dysuria , decrease in urination frequency to 6.5 +/- 0.5 times a day , increase the bladder capacity , which ultimately improved patients the quality of life. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was well tolerated , there were no adverse effects. Morphological studies confirmed positive clinical changes following hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The study findings support wider use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the management of radiation
