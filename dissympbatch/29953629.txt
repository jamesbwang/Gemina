  Noninfectious pulmonary complications ( NIPCs) frequently occur following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT). As there is no consensus on the description of the related pulmonary pathological lesions<symptom> , pathologist reports and clinical conclusions are largely inconsistent in routine practice. The aim of our study was to provide an accurate overview of post allogeneic HSCT NIPCs from a large number of lung biopsies. We reviewed 61 lung biopsies in patients with an NIPC , including 51 surgical lung biopsies , 4 post mortem biopsies and 6 lung explants. We found both bronchiolar ( n = 59) and alveolar/interstitial pathologies ( n = 27). We described two types of bronchiolar lesions<symptom>: bronchiolectasies ( n = 37) and fibrous and cellular lesions<symptom> with luminal narrowing ( n = 43). We found a wide spectrum of airway/interstitial pathologies that were labelled using terminology of the 2013 American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society ( ATS/ERS) classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias<disease> ( IIPs) , including the following: organizing pneumonia<disease> ( OP , n = 8) , nonspecific interstitial pneumonia<disease> ( NSIP , n = 9) , diffuse alveolar damage ( DAD , n = 6) , lymphoid interstitial pneumonia<disease> ( LIP , n = 1) and pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis ( PPFE , n = 2) , as well as one instance of associated PPFE and NSIP. Interstitial pathology was associated with bronchiolar lesions<symptom> in 41 % of the reviewed cases ( n = 25). Lung airway and interstitial inflammation<symptom> was still present in lung explants from patients who underwent lung transplantation for post allogeneic HSCT end-stage respiratory insufficiency. Herein , we describe a wide spectrum of pathological lung lesions<symptom> encountered in post allogeneic HSCT NIPCs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
