  The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an avatar-based education application for improving knowledge and self-care behaviour in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF). Avatar-based technologies for supporting education are an innovative approach for patients with low literacy , low health literacy and English as a second language. The use of avatar technologies for patient education has shown benefits in improving knowledge , self-care behaviours and quality of life in chronic<disease> diseases<disease> such as cancer , diabetes and depression<symptom> Research has demonstrated positive outcomes in clinical practice. However , the effectiveness of this technology has not been evaluated among patients with HF. A multi-centred , non-blinded randomized , two-armed parallel pragmatic , controlled trial. Eighty-eight participants will be recruited from the HF clinics at three public hospitals and randomized into either control or intervention groups. The intervention group will receive the avatar-based education plus usual care. The control group will receive usual care. The primary outcome is HF knowledge , secondary outcomes include; improved self-care behaviours , readmission and satisfaction. Data will be collected at the baseline and at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. This study will measure the effectiveness of avatar-based education on patients ' knowledge and self-care behaviours following HF. The evidence will be evaluated in terms of the reduction in patients ' readmission.
