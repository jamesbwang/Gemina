  The purpose of this study was to measure the frequency and identify factors associated with delayed socket healing after dental extraction in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy for hematologic malignancy. This prospective cohort study focused on delayed healing after extraction in patients with hematologic malignancy. Sockets with delayed healing were defined as those with intense<symptom> pain<symptom> and bone exposure 1 week postoperatively. Patients with and without delayed socket healing were compared using the Fisher exact test and Mann-Whitney U test with some variables. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was conducted to define cutoff values for delayed healing. One hundred ninety-four dental extractions in 93 patients ( median age , 64 yr; range , 20 to 85 yr) were analyzed. The incidence of delayed socket healing was 7.5 % ( 7 of 93 patients). There was no postoperative bleeding. Older age , type of hematologic malignancy ( acute leukemia<disease>) , shorter time from dental extraction to initiation of chemotherapy , low platelet count or hemoglobin level , requirement for red blood cell concentrate or platelet transfusion , and use of an absorbable hemostatic agent were statistically associated with the occurrence of delayed socket healing. Platelet and hemoglobin cutoffs were 4.6 Ã— 10 Although dental extraction can be safely performed in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy for hematologic malignancy , oral surgeons should understand the potential risk for delayed socket healing. When considering dental extraction , patients with hematologic malignancy and low hemoglobin or platelet levels should be informed about the possibility of delayed socket healing.
