  It is often difficult to diagnose an intracranial aneurysm<disease> at the distal internal carotid artery by conventional magnetic resonance imaging. We assessed the effectiveness of the local excitation technique , a new application for magnetic resonance imaging , to clarify the geometric structure of aneurysm<disease> and adjacent branches at the distal internal carotid artery. Two independent evaluators diagnosed 10 cases of suspected aneurysms<disease> at the distal internal carotid artery by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with application of local excitation , adding it to conventional time-of-flight-magnetic resonance angiography. We successfully distinguished the aneurysm<disease> from infundibular dilatation in five of 10 cases. Our results suggested that addition of local excitation to conventional magnetic resonance angiography was effective to diagnose unruptured aneurysm<disease> at the distal internal carotid artery , to clarify the configuration of the prominent lesion<symptom> or whether the location of the adjacent branch orifice on the parent vessel was symmetric or asymmetric.
