  Although classical human astroviruses ( HAstV) are known to be a leading cause of viral gastroenteritis<disease> , the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of novel HAstV remain largely unknown. There is mounting evidence that , in contrast to classical astroviruses , novel HAstV exhibit tropism for the upper respiratory<disease> tract<symptom>. This one-year period prevalence screened all available clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from pediatric patients aged â‰¤ 5 years for novel and classical HAstV using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A total of 205 samples were tested; two novel HAstV cases were detected for a prevalence of 1.3 % , with viral loads suggesting active upper respiratory<disease> tract<symptom> replication. No classical HAstV was detected.
