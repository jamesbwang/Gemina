  Montelukast , a potent selective antagonist of cysteinyl leukotriene ( cysLT) receptors , has displayed its important anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in various tissues and organs. Rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) is an immune disease defined by hyperplastic synovitis<symptom> and joint destruction. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes in RA ( RA-FLSs) are the main cell component of the hyperplastic synovium. Whether montelukast can protect against the inflammatory milieu of RA remains unclear. Here , it is shown that cysLT1R is present in FLSs and unregulated in RA-FLSs. Montelukast has an inhibitory effect on the inflammatory microenvironment of RA by decreasing the secretion of IL-6 , IL-8 , MMP-3 and MMP-13 in FLSs induced by IL-1β. Notably , treatment with montelukast attenuated IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of IκBα , IκBα degradation , nuclear translocation of p65 and NF-κB activity to express a luciferase reporter gene in FLSs. The findings of the current study provide evidence for a novel therapeutic strategy for RA using montelukast.
