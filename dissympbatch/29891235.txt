  Myocardial involvement is common in acute idiopathic pericarditis<disease> and can , in some cases , lead to life-threatening complications. Acute idiopathic pericarditis<disease> is often preceded by various prodromal symptoms , but whether these symptoms can predict myocardial involvement is unclear. The aim of the study was to examine the value of different prodromal symptoms of acute idiopathic pericarditis<disease> for predicting myocardial involvement. Patients diagnosed with acute idiopathic pericarditis<disease> in 2007-2017 at our hospital were identified by database search. Demographic parameters , levels of plasma cardiac troponin and creatine kinase , and findings on echocardiography , magnetic resonance imaging , cardiac computed tomography and coronary angiography and data on prodromal symptoms were extracted from the medical files. The final cohort included 239 patients ( 73.2 % males) aged 18-89 years. The most common prodromal symptoms were fever<disease> , chills<symptom> , cough<symptom> , sore<symptom> throat<symptom> , abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , and diarrhea<disease> Myocardial involvement was observed in 83 patients ( 34.7 %) , leading to cardiogenic shock<symptom> in 4 ( 4.8 %). Patients with myocardial involvement more often had prodromal diarrhea<disease> , fever<disease> , sore<symptom> throat<symptom> , vomiting , atypical chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , and pharyngitis<disease> On multivariate analysis , diarrhea<disease> , sore<symptom> throat<symptom> and fever<disease> were strong independent predictors of myocardial involvement ( OR , 14.257 , 95 % CI , 3.920-51.782 , p < 0.001 , OR , 9.6 , 95 % CI , 2.934-31.982 , p < 0.001 and OR , 2.445 , 95 % CI , 1.077-5.550 , p = 0.025). Diarrhea<disease> was associated with left ventricular dysfunction as well. In acute idiopathic pericarditis<disease> , prodromal diarrhea<disease> , sore<symptom> throat<symptom> and fever<disease> strongly predict myocardial involvement , resulting in life-threatening hemodynamic compromise in a minority of the patients.
