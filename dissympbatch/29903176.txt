  To understand the dietary intake situation of Uighur pregnant women , investigate folic acid level and its influencing factors , to provide evidence for health education of maternal nutrition and implementation of proper nutrition , balanceddiet guidance. 358 cases of Uighur trimester pregnant women for the study , took the method of 3 d 24 h dietary recall to survey their dietary and collect blood samples. The Hb was detected by the cyanide methemoglobinmethod. The content of folic acid was determined by a double antibody biotin sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) method. The data processing used V2. 7. 13 nutrition calculator software , and compare with `` DRIs `` in 2013. Diet composition and nutrient intake: Grains , livestock , poultry , fats and oils intake almost reached the standards , vegetables , fruits , eggs , milk and beans intake were below standards , the intake of fish and shrimp<disease> were ( 0. 18 ± 3. 95) g , high salt intake ( 9. 03 ± 3. 97). In early pregnancy , energy ( 101. 19 %) , protein ( 107. 87 %) , calcium ( 32. 48 %) , iron ( 195. 30 %) , zinc ( 106. 63 %) , selenium ( 55. 77 %) , iodine ( 15. 54 %) , vitamin B1 ( 87. 50 %) vitamin B2 ( 60. 00 %) , vitamin C ( 65. 69 %) , folic acid ( 13. 21 %). The late pregnant energy ( 84. 29 %) , protein ( 72. 44 %) , calcium ( 27. 77 %) , iron ( 180. 38 %) , zinc ( 121. 16 %) , selenium ( 53. 11 %) , iodine ( 11. 26 %) , vitamin B1 ( 75. 33 %) , vitamin B2 ( 49. 33 %) , vitamin C ( 57. 37 %) , folic acid ( 13. 15 %). The total detection rate of anemia<symptom> in pregnant women was 18. 89 % , mean of Hb was ( 119. 42 ± 13. 90) g/L. Comparison of Hb levels ( P < 0. 05) and anemia<symptom> detection rate ( P < 0. 05) in the early and late pregnant women , the difference was significant; total lack of folic acid detection rate was 75. 42 % , the average folate levels ( 9. 15 ± 4. 22) nmol/L , compare folate levels ( P < 0. 05) and folate deficiency detection rate ( P < 0. 05) in early and late pregnant women , the difference was significant. The dietary structure of pregnant women is less irrational. The intake of fruits and vegetables are inadequate and the intake of fish and shrimp<disease> is serious lack. The intake of salt is high. The proportion of three heat nutrients are in a suitable ratio range. The energy and protein intake are below the DRIs in the late pregnant , iron and zinc intake are high. The selenium , vitamin B2 and C intake are inadequate , a serious lack of calcium , iodine and folic acid in whole pregnancy. The anemia<symptom> in late pregnant is more serious than early pregnant , during pregnancy folate level is low and late pregnant is lower than early.
