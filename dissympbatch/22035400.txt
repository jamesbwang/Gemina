  Hidradenitis suppurativa and synovitis<symptom> , acne , pustulosis , hyperostosis , osteitis syndrome<disease> are chronic , debilitating diseases involving apocrine gland-bearing skin<symptom> inflammation<symptom> and bone inflammation<symptom> , respectively. Although both often present with multiple comorbidities , single patient co-presentation is rare. This study reports the 8-year treatment course of a 40-year-old man with hidradenitis suppurativa and synovitis<symptom> , acne , pustulosis , hyperostosis , osteitis syndrome<disease> , and reviews relevant literature. Initial oral and topical antibiotics had little effect. Intralesional corticosteroid injections were effective for localized inflammatory lesions<symptom> but insufficient for hidradenitis suppurativa control. Adalimumab initiation and local excision of a persistent HS lesion<symptom> led to stabilization. Adalimumab provided dramatic back pain improvement. Synovitis<symptom> , acne , pustulosis , hyperostosis , osteitis was diagnosed; adalimumab continuation with subsequent methotrexate addition resulted in hidradenitis suppurativa-synovitis , acne , pustulosis , hyperostosis , osteitis control. Literature regarding comorbid hidradenitis suppurativa and synovitis<symptom> , acne , pustulosis , hyperostosis , osteitis syndrome<disease> therapy is scarce but growing. Adalimumab , methotrexate , intralesional corticosteroid , and lifestyle changes successfully maintained a severe hidradenitis suppurativa-synovitis , acne , pustulosis , hyperostosis , osteitis-syndrome case. Further studies beyond a case-based review could yield more definitive treatment plans.
