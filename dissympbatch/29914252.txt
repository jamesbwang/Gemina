  Background/aim: Abnormalities in oral mucosal immunity contribute to complex pathogenesis of primary Sjögren 's syndrome<disease> ( pSjS). We aimed to measure saliva and serum levels of caspase-1 , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha ( TNF-α) and interferon gamma ( IFN-γ) in patients with pSjS. Materials and methods: We studied 43 pSjS patients fulfilling the AECG criteria and 30 age/sex-matched healthy controls , as well as 39 rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) patients as a disease control group. ESSDAI scores were less than seven in all patients with pSjS , indicating low disease activity. Quantitative analyses were made in serum and whole saliva samples. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 19.0. Results: While no significant difference was found in serum measurements , saliva levels of TNF-α and caspase-1 were significantly higher in pSjS patients versus healthy controls when using the Mann-Whitney U test. On the other hand , in the pSjS group , saliva levels of TNF-α and caspase-1 were also significantly higher compared to the RA group using Student 's t-test. In the pSjS group , those parameters did not show any correlation with disease duration , seropositivity , and smoking. Conclusion: Despite low disease activity , saliva TNF-α and caspase-1 levels were found to be significantly higher in the pSjS group , which may suggest a possible advantage of local anticytokine treatments in selected cases.
