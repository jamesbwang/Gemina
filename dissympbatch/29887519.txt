  Although there is some evidence that older people might have a poorer course of major depressive disorder ( MDD) than younger or middle-aged people , and that age-related course differences might affect the optimisation of MDD treatment , large-scale studies with a broad age range , including consistent course assessments , are needed to properly address this issue. Therefore , we aimed to longitudinally examine whether older age was associated with a poorer naturalistic course trajectory of MDD than that of younger ages and to establish which prognostic-clinical , social , and health-factors could explain this potentially poorer course. For this longitudinal cohort study , we used baseline and 2-year follow-up data from the Netherlands Study of Depression<symptom> and Anxiety<symptom> ( NESDA) and the Netherlands Study of Depression<symptom> in Older Persons ( NESDO) cohorts. People aged between 18 and 88 years , with an MDD diagnosis at baseline , and a valid clinical assessment at 2-year follow-up were included. The primary outcome was the 2-year course of MDD , which was assessed by use of four indicators: having a depression<symptom> diagnosis ( MDD or dysthymia) after 2 years , having a chronic symptom course ( depressive symptoms present during 80 % or more of the 2-year follow-up period) , time to remission , and depression<symptom> severity change. We used multivariate analyses to examine associations between continuous age and these MDD course indicators. We also examined whether prognostic clinical ( eg , comorbid anxiety<symptom>) , social ( loneliness and social support) , and health ( body-mass index , pain , and chronic<disease> diseases<disease>) factors contributed to the differences in the course of MDD between age groups. Between 2004-2012 , baseline and 2-year follow-up data were obtained for 1042 participants from the NESDA and NESDO cohorts , of whom 690 ( 66 %) were women. Older age was significantly associated with a worse 2-year MDD course for all four indicators ( MDD diagnosis: odds ratio ( OR) 1 · 08 , 95 % CI 1 · 00-1 · 17; chronic symptom course: OR 1 · 24 , 1 · 13-1 · 35; time to remission: hazard ratio ( HR) 0 · 91 , 0 · 87-0 · 96; and depression<symptom> severity change: regression coefficient 1 · 06 , p < 0 · 0001; all per 10-year increase). The course of MDD worsened linearly with age , and people aged 70 years or older had the worst outcomes compared with those of the reference group of people aged 18-29 years ( MDD diagnosis: OR 2 · 02 , 95 % CI 1 · 18-3 · 45; chronic symptom course: OR 3 · 19 , 1 · 74-5 · 84; time to remission: HR 0 · 60 , 0 · 44-0 · 83; and depression<symptom> severity change: -12 · 64 ( SD 10 · 85) in those aged 18-29 years and -5 · 57 ( 11 · 14) in those aged 70 years or older). These results were slightly reduced , but remained mostly significant when adjusting for prognostic clinical , social , and health factors. Older age was found to be a consistent and important risk factor for a poorer MDD course , which could not be explained by a range of well established risk factors. Further investigation of potential underlying mechanisms-including the effect of cognitive impairment , for example-is needed to prevent the negative consequences of a long-term MDD burden in older people.
