  Introduction Only a few studies compare the efficacy of the harmonic scalpel and electrocautery in performing mastectomies , and these have mainly compared their intraoperative parameters. But the main concern with electrocautery is the incidence of flap necrosis<symptom> and seroma formation. Therefore , this study was done to determine if the harmonic scalpel has any advantages over electrocautery in reducing postoperative flap necrosis<symptom> and seroma formation in patients undergoing a modified radical mastectomy ( MRM). Methodology This randomized control trial was carried out over a one-year period in a tertiary care centre in South India. The study patients were randomized into an electrocautery group and a harmonic scalpel group. In the first group , mastectomy including flap and axillary dissection was done using electrocautery. In the second group , a harmonic scalpel was used for dissection. This study compared the efficacy of the harmonic scalpel with electrocautery in terms of postoperative seroma formation and flap necrosis<symptom>. Various other perioperative parameters like the number of drain days , total drainage volume ( in mL) , operating time ( in minutes) , intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( in mL) , and postoperative wound<disease> site pain were also studied. During each postoperative visit , the presence of seroma was assessed clinically , and the number of aspirations required for the seroma was also analysed. Results A total of 240 patients were randomized into two groups of 120 patients each. Baseline parameters were comparable across both groups. There were significant differences in the duration of surgery ( 151.38 mins vs. 112.33 mins; p = 0.001) and intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( 276.25 mL vs. 200.13 mL; p = 0.001). On Postoperative Day ( POD) 1 , the difference in the mean pain scores ( 6 vs. 4; p = 0.001) was statistically significant. In addition , the differences in the mean total drainage volume ( 937.5 mL vs. 470 mL; p = 0.002) and the incidence of seroma during the first follow-up ( 34.2 % vs. 21.7 %; p = 0.030) were statistically significant. The difference in the incidence of flap necrosis<symptom> on POD 4 ( 7.5 % vs. 4.2 %; p = 0.2706) was not statistically significant. None of the patients developed flap necrosis<symptom> after four days. Conclusion The harmonic scalpel reduces the total drainage volume of seromas , the number of drain days , intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , duration of surgery , postoperative pain ( especially on POD 1 and 5) , and incidence of flap
