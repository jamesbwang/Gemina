  The purpose of this article was to propose a V-shaped minimal facelift incision ( FLI) and analyze its efficacy for improving the esthetic outcomes of parotid<symptom> gland tumors. A prospective , nonrandomized study was performed. Forty-six patients with category I benign parotid tumors as to Quer classification ( 3 cm or less and located superficially and/or peripherally in the gland) were enrolled. The 46 patients who underwent dissection of parotid<symptom> gland tumors were divided into 2 groups: minimal FLI ( group 1) and modified Blair incision ( MBI , group 2). The modified minimal FLI was performed via V-shaped preauricular and retroauricular incision with no extension to the hair bearing skin. The operation variables and the cosmetic satisfaction of the patients in each group were compared. Twenty-three patients underwent the minimal FLI approach and 23 underwent the conventional modified Blair incision approach. No recurrence developed in any of the patients at the follow-up for an average of 18.9 Â± 2.7 months. Among the operation factors , the authors observed no other significant differences in the size of tumor , operative time , or completeness of resection ( P > 0.05). Moreover , facial palsy and Frey syndrome<disease> also did not differ between the 2 groups ( P > 0.05). However , cosmetic satisfaction evaluated with a graded scale showed much better results in the V-shaped minimal FLI approach group ( P < 0.001). V-shaped minimal FLI with excellent cosmetic outcomes could be used as a safe and preferable approach for parotidectomy , especially for the more conservative extracapsular dissection in small tumors.
