  Psoriasis ( PsO) is an inflammatory disorder characterized by proliferation of keratinocytes , and it may be associated with a systemic inflammatory articular disorder , psoriatic arthritis<disease> ( PsA). The presentations of PsO and PsA are heterogeneous , and our understanding of pathogenesis has led to a better understanding of the role of the interleukin ( IL) -23/ T-helper 17 ( Th17) axis. Areas covered: Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody against IL-12 and IL-23. The pathogenesis of PsO and PsA is a multifactorial process involving genetic , environmental , and lifestyle factors. IL-23 signaling and activation of Th17 cells leads to a self-perpetuating inflammatory loop resulting in continuous keratinocyte proliferation and synovitis<symptom>. Treatment options are varied , ranging from topical therapy to injection of targeted biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( bDMARDs). Evidence on the use of ustekinumab in the management of PsO is strong , but it is not as impressive in management of PsA. Expert opinion: IL-12/ 23 inhibition appears to be a good first-line option for plaque PsO , but efficacy in PsA does not compare favorably to IL-17 inhibition. In general , poorer responses to therapy with any bDMARD in PsA cohorts highlight psoriatic disease heterogeneity. Until new knowledge can remedy the failure of monotherapy , synergistic methods may have to be explored , including combination biologic therapy.
