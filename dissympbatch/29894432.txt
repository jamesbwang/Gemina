  Surgical scar length is a common concern among patients undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery ( MMS). This study evaluates 3 metrics of preoperative lesion<symptom> size to determine which correlates best with primary linear closure lengths for nonmelanoma skin cancers ( NMSCs) treated with MMS. This metric is then used to develop predictive models for linear closure lengths in 10 different anatomical regions. A retrospective study of 4,049 NMSCs treated with MMS and repaired with primary linear closure was conducted. Primary closure lengths were plotted against preoperative lesion<symptom> circumference , area , and short axis length. Linear regression analysis was performed. Preoperative NMSC circumference correlated best with closure length. Twenty-one of the 28 regression models had coefficients of determination ( R) above 0.5. Closure lengths increased by 0.52 to 1.1 mm , depending on location , for every millimeter increase in preoperative NMSC circumference. Preoperative lesion<symptom> circumference is directly proportional to primary closure length and is a better indicator of closure length than preoperative area and short axis for MMS of NMSCs. Closure lengths located on the nasal tip , supratip , or periocular areas are most sensitive to differences in NMSC size. These data might aid Mohs surgeons with preoperative planning for wound<disease> reconstruction and patient counseling.
