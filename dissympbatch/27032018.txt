  Cervical Sympathetic Chain Schwannomas ( CSCS) of the carotid sheath are rare neoplasms that can be misdiagnosed on imaging. The following case documents a rare incident of a misdiagnosed CSCS with unusual outcomes of permanent Horner 's syndrome<disease> and facial<symptom> pain<symptom>. A 36-year-old female presented with a slow-growing neck mass. CT and MRI led to a preoperative diagnosis of vagus nerve schwannoma ( VNS). However , surgical treatment revealed the mass to be involved with the cervical sympathetic chain rather than the vagus nerve. The diagnosis was corrected to CSCS and the nerve was resected with the mass. The patient presented postoperatively with Horner 's syndrome<disease> and severe facial<symptom> pain<symptom>. These symptoms persisted despite two years of medical management. Studies indicate that imaging trends used for distinction between VNS and CSCS show inconsistencies in making preoperative diagnoses. Recent literature reveals helpful criteria for improving diagnostic standards that assist with preoperative patient counseling. In addition , postoperative outcomes , such as temporary , asymptomatic Horner 's syndrome<disease> are common in CSCS. The following case report exemplifies the difficulties in diagnosis and addresses the unique complications of facial<symptom> pain<symptom> and permanent Horner 's syndrome<disease>. This case report examines postoperative outcomes and improves clinician awareness of the potential for misdiagnosis of a rare neoplasm and the recently improved diagnostic measures , providing for higher quality preoperative counseling. Future research is recommended to confirm and improve diagnostic guidelines and accuracy. Additional studies may focus on evaluating the effects of incorrect preoperative diagnosis on postoperative complication rates.
