  With the continuing development of newer targeted therapies in oncology , it is necessary to understand their potential cardiovascular side effects. In this review , we discuss the association of novel targeted agents and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Within the last 5 years , multiple new agents have been developed to target specific cancer pathways and found to have off-targeted cardiotoxicity. The most recent example is the recognition of myocarditis<disease> caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors. The development of targeted cancer therapies has revolutionized oncology , but many of these agents are inherently toxic to the cardiovascular system. Nearly all vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) inhibitors cause cardiotoxicity to varying degrees. Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) inhibitors developed since the discovery of trastuzumab are significantly less cardiotoxic than their predecessor , but still convene risk. BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKI) , once thought to pose significant risk as a class effect , appear to only be cardiotoxic if they have anti-VEGF activity. The newer generation of proteasome inhibitors such as carfilzomib appears to have significant cardiotoxicity , with almost 5 % of patients developing symptomatic heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF). Immune checkpoint inhibitors can very rarely cause rapidly fatal myocarditis<disease> As of now , there are no sufficient guidelines to direct clinical care for patients on these new classes of agents , but this is likely to change as more data and clinical experience accumulate.
