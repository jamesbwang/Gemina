  For myocarditis<disease> and inflammatory cardiomyopathy , an etiologically driven treatment is today the best option beyond heart<symptom> failure<symptom> therapy. Prerequisites for this are noninvasive and invasive biomarkers including endomyocardial biopsy and polymerase chain reaction on cardiotropic agents. Imaging by Doppler echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging as well as cardiac biomarkers such as C‑reactive protein , N‑terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide , and troponins can contribute to the clinical work-up of the syndrome<disease> but not toward elucidating the underlying cause or pathogenetic process. This review summarizes the phases and clinical features of myocarditis<disease> and gives an up-to-date short overview of the current treatment options starting with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and antiarrhythmic therapy. Although inflammation<symptom> in myocardial disease can resolve spontaneously , often specific treatment directed against the causative agent is required. For fulminant , acute , and chronic autoreactive myocarditis<disease> , immunosuppressive treatment has proven to be beneficial in the TIMIC and ESETCID trials; for viral cardiomyopathy and myocarditis<disease> , intravenous immunoglobulin IgG subtype and polyvalent intravenous immunoglobulins IgG , IgA , and IgM can frequently resolve inflammation<symptom>. However , despite the elimination of inflammation<symptom> , the eradication of parvovirus B19 and human herpesvirus-6 is still a challenge , for which ivIg treatment can become a future key player.
