  Bone<disease> marrow ( BM) produces hematopoietic and progenitor cells that contribute to distant organ<symptom> inflammation<symptom> and repair. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) is characterized by defective lung repair. Yet , BM composition has not been previously characterized in COPD patients. In this prospective and controlled study , BM was obtained by sternum fine-needle aspiration in 35 COPD patients and 25 healthy controls ( 10 smokers and 15 never-smokers). BM cell count and immunophenotype were determined by microscopy and flow cytometry , respectively. Circulating inflammatory ( C-reactive protein , IL-6 , IL-8) and repair markers ( HGF , IGF , TGF-Î² , VEGF) were quantified by ELISA. Results were integrated by multi-level network correlation analysis. We found that: ( 1) there were no major significant pair wise differences between COPD patients and controls in the BM structural characteristics; ( 2) multi-level network analysis including patients and controls identifies a relation between immunity , repair and lung function not previously described , that remains in the COPD network but is absent in controls; and ( 3) this novel network identifies eosinophils as a potential mediator relating immunity and repair , particularly in patients with emphysema. Overall , these results suggest that BM is activated in COPD with impaired repair capacity in patients with more emphysema and/or higher circulating eosinophils.
