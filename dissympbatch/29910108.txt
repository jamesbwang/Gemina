  Acute on chronic liver failure ( ACLF) is associated with high short term mortality. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence , predictors and impact of bacterial infection in ACLF. Consecutive hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and acute decompensation ( AD) , from January 2011-March 2017 , were included. Predictors of survival and infection were assessed. 572 patients with cirrhosis and AD were classified into 3 groups- no infection ( group 1 , n = 190 , 33.2 %) , infection at admission/within 48 h ( group 2 , n = 298 , 52.1 %) and infection after 48 h ( group 3 , n = 84 , 14.7 %). Higher frequency of organ<symptom> failures<symptom>- kidney , brain , circulation and respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom>- were seen in groups 2 and 3 as compared with group 1 ( P < 0.001 for all). Most common site of infection was lungs , followed by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis<disease> and urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> The frequency of infection increased with higher ACLF grades. Among ACLF patients , on Cox-proportional multivariate analysis , presence of infection was associated with significantly higher mortality ( group 2 ( HR 2.93; 95 % CI , 1.97-4.38 , P < 0.001) and group 3 ( HR 1.84; 95 % CI , 1.16-2.91 , P = 0.009)) , as compared with group 1. On multivariate logistic regression analysis , advanced hepatic encephalopathy and elevated total leucocyte count were independently associated with development of infection. Infections are common in ACLF , and associated with poor outcome.
