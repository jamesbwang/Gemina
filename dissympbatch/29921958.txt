  The brain microenvironment imposes a particularly intense selective pressure on metastasis-initiating cells , but successful metastases bypass this control through mechanisms that are poorly understood. Reactive astrocytes are key components of this microenvironment that confine brain metastasis without infiltrating the lesion<symptom>. Here , we describe that brain metastatic cells induce and maintain the co-option of a pro-metastatic program driven by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3) in a subpopulation of reactive astrocytes surrounding metastatic lesions<symptom>. These reactive astrocytes benefit metastatic cells by their modulatory effect on the innate and acquired immune system. In patients , active STAT3 in reactive astrocytes correlates with reduced survival from diagnosis of intracranial metastases. Blocking STAT3 signaling in reactive astrocytes reduces experimental brain metastasis from different primary tumor sources , even at advanced stages of colonization. We also show that a safe and orally bioavailable treatment that inhibits STAT3 exhibits significant antitumor effects in patients with advanced systemic<disease> disease<disease> that included brain metastasis. Responses to this therapy were notable in the central nervous system , where several complete responses were achieved. Given that brain metastasis causes substantial morbidity and mortality , our results identify a novel treatment for increasing survival in patients with secondary brain tumors.
