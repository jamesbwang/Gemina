  To objectively assess recovery of thumb opposition in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome<disease> ( CTS) after open carpal tunnel release and to evaluate electrophysiological and magnetic resonance ( MR) neurography findings as predictors of thumb opposition recovery. A total of 22 patients with severe CTS and thenar atrophy were included in this study. A detailed clinical , electrophysiological , and MR neurography evaluation was done both before and after surgery at 6 months to assess thumb opposition recovery. The median duration of symptoms was 12 months ( interquartile range , 12-20 months). The compound muscle action potential of the abductor pollisis brevis ( CMAP-APB) also showed statistically significant improvement of 0.5 + 0.2 mV after surgery. Tip-tip pulp pinch strength increased from 1.2 ± 0.4 to 2.0 ± 0.4 kg at 6-month follow-up , lateral pulp pinch strength increased from 1.9 ± 0.6 to 2.8 ± 0.9 kg at 6-month follow-up , and 3-point pulp pinch also improved from 1.9 ± 0.5 to 2.8 ± 0.9 at final follow-up. On MR neurogram , the proportion of patients with abnormal median nerve morphology decreased from 81.8 % to 68.2 % , abnormal thenar branch morphology decreased from 63.6 % to 36.4 % and denervation edema<symptom> deceased from 59.1 % to 13.6 %. Patients suffering from severe CTS with thenar atrophy and detectable CMAP-APB showed promising improvement following open carpal tunnel release. Prognostic IV.
