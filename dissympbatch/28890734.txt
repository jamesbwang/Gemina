  Many glaciers in the northwest of High Mountain<disease> Asia ( HMA) show an almost zero or positive mass balance<symptom> , despite the global trend of melting glaciers. This phenomenon is often referred to as the `` Karakoram anomaly , '' although strongest positive mass balances<symptom> can be found in the Kunlun Shan mountain<disease> range , northeast of the Karakoram. Using a regional climate model , in combination with a moisture-tracking model , we show that the increase in irrigation intensity in the lowlands surrounding HMA , particularly in the Tarim basin , can locally counter the effects of global warming on glaciers in Kunlun Shan , and parts of Pamir and northern Tibet , through an increase in summer snowfall and decrease in net radiance. Irrigation can thus affect the regional climate in a way that favors glacier growth , and future projections of glacier melt , which may impact millions of inhabitants surrounding HMA , will need to take into account predicted changes in irrigation intensity.
