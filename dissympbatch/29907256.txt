  Although any fish-eating mammals could be potential definitive hosts of Opisthorchis viverrini , only a few , especially cats and dogs , are actually known reservoir hosts for this parasite. Both animals usually get infected via consuming raw or undercooked contaminated fish , fish dishes or food remains from households. The infected animals sustain parasite egg spread via open environment defecation. Cats are the most important reservoir with higher prevalence rates of O. viverrini infection than dogs in endemic areas. Usually Opisthorchis-infected animals do not exhibit apparent clinical symptoms or specific abnormalities in laboratory examinations. Pathological findings in these animal reservoirs are basically similar to those seen in humans and experimental animals , namely periductal inflammation<symptom> , biliary hyperplasia<disease> and periductal fibrosis<disease>. However , O. viverrini-associated cholangiocarcinoma has not yet been reported in the reservoir animals at present. Praziquantel is a treatment of choice not only for humans but also for animal reservoirs. Integrated control of opisthorchiasis in animal reservoirs is based on holistic approaches such as EcoHealth/One Health concepts. In fact integrated control of opisthorchiasis in humans in ecosystem has also proved successful , for example , the Lawa model for opisthorchiasis control in the endemic area of Khon Kaen , Thailand. Other feral and wild animals in endemic areas might also be potential reservoirs , and this requires more investigation. In addition , genetic diversity and evolution of the flukes might also influence zoonotic capability.
