  This study aimed to assess the prevalence of metabolic syndrome<disease> and the level of knowledge and awareness of its related conditions in a sample of cancer survivor patients. In this cross-sectional survey , a self-reported questionnaire was administered to outpatients aged > 20 years with a diagnosis of cancer. This self-reported questionnaire on patient demographic characteristics , disease characteristics , and knowledge and awareness of metabolic syndrome<disease> was used as an instrument to assess patient 's knowledge of metabolic syndrome<disease>. A total of 88 participants were included; of these 34.1 % had metabolic syndrome<disease> , although only 6.8 % of participants were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome<disease>. Over half of the participants had heard about metabolic syndrome<disease>; however , 70 % of the participants did not know about the blood tests for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome<disease> although they were aware of the physical measurements , such as weight , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and waist circumference. The highest proportion of correct answers for questions about metabolic syndrome<disease> was related to stroke , while the lowest was about cholesterol levels. The proportions of correct answers for selected parameters were as follows: diabetes , 39.1 %; adiposity , 47.2 %; hypertension , 46.8 %; cholesterol levels , 36.7 %; arteriosclerosis , 45.5 %; myocardial infarction , 37.8 %; and stroke , 62.8 %. The results suggest that the level of knowledge of metabolic syndrome<disease> among the cancer survivors in our sample was poor , although more than one-third of them had metabolic syndrome<disease>. Thus , it is essential to educate cancer survivors about metabolic syndrome<disease> and its related conditions to improve their overall health and quality of life.
