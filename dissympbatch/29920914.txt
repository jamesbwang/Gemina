  The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of the combination of robot-assisted percutaneous screw placement and pelvic internal fixator ( INFIX) for minimally invasive treatment of unstable anterior and posterior pelvic ring injuries. From September 2016 to June 2017 , twenty-four patients with unstable anterior and posterior pelvic ring injuries were treated with TiRobot-assisted percutaneous sacroiliac cannulated screw fixation on the posterior pelvic ring combined with robot-assisted pedicle screw placement in the anterior inferior iliac spine along with INFIX on the anterior pelvic ring. The results of the treatment , including surgery duration , fluoroscopy frequency , total drilling , amount of blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , fracture healing time , and postoperative functional outcomes were recorded and compared with another 21 similar patients who underwent conventional manual positioning surgery. The TiRobot group incurred significantly shorter duration of surgery; less fluoroscopy frequency , intraoperative bleeding , and total drilling than in the conventional group ( P < 0.05). Postoperative radiological follow-up showed that all screws were in the safe area and no screw penetrated the cortex. All wounds<disease> healed by primary intention and no iatrogenic damage to the blood vessels , nerves , and organs occurred. Patients showed good tolerance to INFIX and reported no discomfort. The mean follow-up duration was 5.4 months; the fractures were all healed , no loss of reduction occurred , and the mean Majeed score at the last follow-up did not show any difference. TiRobot-assisted percutaneous screw placement combined with INFIX for the anterior and posterior pelvic ring injuries is accurate , safe , less invasive , and shows satisfactory efficacy , suggesting it is a better method for minimally invasive treatment of unstable pelvic ring fractures.
