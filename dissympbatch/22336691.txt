  The benefit results of postoperative tight glycemic control ( TGC) were controversial and there was a lack of well-powered studies that support current guideline recommendations. The EMBASE , MEDLINE , and the Cochrane Library databases were searched utilizing the key words `` Blood Glucose '' , `` insulin '' and `` Postoperative Period '' to retrieve all randomized controlled trials evaluating the benefits of postoperative TGC as compared to conventional glycemic control ( CGC) in patients undergoing surgery. Fifteen studies involving 5053 patients were identified. As compared to CGC group , there were lower risks of total postoperative infection ( 9.4 % vs. 15.8 %; RR 0.586 , 95 % CI 0.504 to 0.680 , p < 0.001) and wound<disease> infection<disease> ( 4.6 % vs. 7.2 %; RR 0.620 , 95 % CI 0.422 to 0.910 , p = 0.015) in TGC group. TGC also showed a lower risk of postoperative short-term mortality ( 3.8 % vs. 5.4 %; RR 0.692 , 95 % CI 0.527 to 0.909 , p = 0.008) , but sensitivity analyses showed that the result was mainly influenced by one study. The patients in the TGC group experienced a significant higher rate of postoperative hypoglycemia ( 22.3 % vs. 11.0 %; RR 3.145 , 95 % CI 1.928 to 5.131 , p < 0.001) and severe hypoglycemia ( 2.8 % vs. 0.7 %; RR 3.821 , 95 % CI 1.796 to 8.127 , p < 0.001) as compared to CGC group. TGC showed less length of ICU stay ( SMD ,- 0.428 days; 95 % CI ,- 0.833 to- 0.022 days; p = 0.039). However , TGC showed a neutral effect on neurological<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> ( 1.1 % vs. 2.4 %; RR 0.499 , 95 % CI 0.219 to 1.137 , p = 0.098) , acute<symptom> renal<symptom> failure<symptom> ( 3.3 % vs. 5.4 % , RR 0.610 , 95 % CI 0.359 to 1.038 , p = 0.068) , duration of mechanical ventilation ( p = 0.201) and length of hospitalization ( p = 0.082). TGC immediately after surgery significantly reduces total postoperative infection rates and short-term mortality. However , it might limit conclusion regarding the efficacy of TGC for short-term mortality in sensitivity analyses. The patients in the TGC group experienced a significant higher rate of postoperative hypoglycemia. This study may suggest that TGC should be administrated under close glucose monitoring in patients undergoing surgery , especially in those with high postoperative infection risk.
