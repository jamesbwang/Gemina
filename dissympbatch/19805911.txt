  Pancreatic cancer is a malignant neoplasm that originates from acinar cells. Acinar cells get reprogrammed to become duct cells , resulting in pancreatic cancer. Pancreatitis<disease> is an acinar cell inflammation<symptom> , leading to `` impaired autophagy flux ''. Pancreatitis<disease> promotes acinar-to-ductal transdifferentiation. Expression of amylase gets eliminated during the progression of pancreatic cancer. Amylase is considered as an acinar cell marker; however , its function in cells is not known. Thus , we investigated whether amylase affects the acinar cell autophagy and whether it plays any role in development of pancreatitis<disease> Here , we knocked out
