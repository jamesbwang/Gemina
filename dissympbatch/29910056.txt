  SENECA ( StEm cell iNjECtion in cAncer survivors) is a phase I , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of delivering allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells ( allo-MSCs) transendocardially in subjects with anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy ( AIC). AIC is an incurable and often fatal syndrome<disease> , with a prognosis worse than that of ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Recently , cell therapy with MSCs has emerged as a promising new approach to repair damaged myocardium. The study population is 36 cancer survivors with a diagnosis of AIC , left ventricular ( LV) ejection fraction ≤ 40 % , and symptoms of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( NYHA class II-III) on optimally-tolerated medical therapy. Subjects must be clinically free of cancer for at least two years with a ≤ 30 % estimated five-year risk of recurrence. The first six subjects participated in an open-label , lead-in phase and received 100 million allo-MSCs; the remaining 30 will be randomized 1:1 to receive allo-MSCs or vehicle via 20 transendocardial injections. Efficacy measures ( obtained at baseline , 6 months , and 12 months) include MRI evaluation of LV function , LV volumes , fibrosis<disease> , and scar burden; assessment of exercise tolerance ( six-minute walk test) and quality of life ( Minnesota Living with Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom> Questionnaire); clinical outcomes ( MACE and cumulative days alive and out of hospital); and biomarkers of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( NT-proBNP). This is the first clinical trial using direct cardiac injection of cells for the treatment of AIC. If administration of allo-MSCs is found feasible and safe , SENECA will pave the way for larger phase II/III studies with therapeutic efficacy as the primary outcome.
