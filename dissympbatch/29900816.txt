  Each year , varicella-zoster virus ( VZV) affects nearly one million people in the United States , often in the form of herpes<disease> zoster<disease> , or shingles. The urologic system is a rare but often debilitating target. This paper reviews the epidemiology , symptomatology , diagnosis , and management of VZV as it relates to urologic practice. We performed a PubMed search using the query `` herpes<disease> zoster<disease> '' and `` varicella-zoster virus '' combined with multiple urological terms. Infection caused by VZV , specifically the resurgent clinical infection herpes<disease> zoster<disease> ( HZ) , is prevalent and increasing. It often affects older men and women and those in immunocompromised states and usually manifests as a painful cutaneous rash<symptom>. However , urological conditions such as voiding dysfunction , erectile issues , and flank pain have also been noted in conjunction with an HZ infection. Additionally , urological procedures and treatments may incite an HZ outbreak. Awareness and prompt treatment can ameliorate the intensity and duration of this infection. An understanding of the atypical manifestations of HZ and disseminated VZV infection may aid urologic practitioners in avoiding misdiagnosis and delay of treatment.
