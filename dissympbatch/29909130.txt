  Serotonin is a critical monoamine neurotransmitter molecule stored and released from enterochromaffin ( EC) cells into the gut submucosa , transmitting the vomiting<symptom> signal to the brain. We studied one mechanism by which vomiting<symptom> is induced in pigs infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea<disease> virus ( PEDV) by characterization of swine EC cells by immunohistochemistry. Conventional or gnotobiotic ( Gn) 9-day-old pigs ( PEDV-inoculated ( n = 12); Mock ( n = 14)) were inoculated orally ( 8.9-9.2 log
