  Arterial hypertension is a progressive cardiovascular syndrome<disease> arising from complex and interrelated etiologies. The human microbiome refers to the community of microorganisms that live in or on the human body. They influence human physiology by interfering in several processes such as providing nutrients and vitamins and in Phase I and Phase II drug metabolism. The human gut microbiota is represented mainly by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and to a lesser degree by Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria , with each individual harbouring at least 160 such species. Gut microbiota contributes to blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> homeostasis and the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension through production , modification and degradation of a variety of microbial-derived bioactive metabolites. Animal studies and to a lesser degree human research has unmasked relative mechanisms , mainly through the effect of certain microbiome metabolites and their receptors , outlining this relationship. Interventions to utilize these pathways , with probiotics , prebiotics , antibiotics and fecal microbiome transplantation have shown promising results. Personalized microbiome-based disease prediction and treatment responsiveness seems futuristic. Undoubtedly , a long way of experimental and clinical research should be pursued to elucidate this novel , intriguing and very promising horizon.
