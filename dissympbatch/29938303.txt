  Intramedullary spinal cord abscesses<disease> ( ISCA) are a rare pathological entity with very few cases reported in the world and may be confused with an intramedullary tumor. Cervical location is the least frequently affected , except for cryptogenic spread , mostly seen in adult patients. Meticulous study of contrast-enhanced MRI pictures has a key role in the diagnosis. We present a case of a spontaneous cervical ISCA , mimicking a spinal cord tumor , in a pediatric patient with good outcome. A review of the literature shows that this is a life-threatening condition with high chances of rupture and subsequent meningitis<disease> We point out that if a solitary cervical spinal cord lesion<symptom> is surrounded by significant medullar edema<symptom> associated with fast onset of symptoms , fever<disease> , and elevation of WBC , the possibility of a spinal cord abscess<disease> should be considered prior to surgery.
