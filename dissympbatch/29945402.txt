  To study the clinical results of needle Dao for the treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome<disease>. From September 2013 to August 2014 , 90 patients with subacromial impingement syndrome<disease> were treated , including 61 females and 29 males , with the average age of ( 55.21 ± 8.30) years old ( ranged , 45 to 65 years old) , and mean course of disease ( 3.49 ± 2.98) months ( ranged , 4 weeks to 7 months). Twenty-six patients had pains<symptom> in left shoulder , and 64 patients had pains<symptom> in right shoulder. Under local anesthesia , needle Dao was performed to release the pain point at the lower edge of the acromion and the subacromial adhesion. By observing the abduction of shoulder joint , anterior flexion and lifting , internal rotation and external rotation , shoulder pain score , the number of cases cured , markedly effective , effective and ineffective after treatment were counted , and the curative effect of needle Dao for the treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome<disease> was evaluated. All the patients completed the treatment successfully without obvious adverse reactions. All the patients were followed up for more than 12 months. The visual analogue scale ( VAS) decreased from preoperative 7.72 ± 5.42 to postoperative 1.35 ± 0.78 ( The advantage of needle Dao in the treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome<disease> is the minimally invasive treatment of the underlying lesions<symptom>. The disadvantage is that it can not deal with the impact caused by bone abnormalities.
