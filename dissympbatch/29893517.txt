  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL) is a condition characterized by the accumulation of morphologically mature monoclonal lymphocytes B with the CD19 +/ CD5 +/ CD23 + phenotype in lymphoid tissue , peripheral blood and bone<disease> marrow. The clinical course of patients with CLL is heterogeneous , ranging from indolent to aggressive. The role of lymphocyte<symptom> activation in the natural history of CLL is still a matter of discussion. The aim of this study was to determine the percentages and absolute numbers of lymphocytes B and T in peripheral blood and bone<disease> marrow of CLL patients. Moreover , we analyzed the relationship between the number of CD25-positive and CD69-positive lymphocytes and the established prognostic factors in CLL. The study included 80 untreated patients with CLL and 20 healthy subjects. The immunophenotype of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( in both groups) and bone<disease> marrow cells ( solely in the CLL group) was determined by means of flow cytometry. Patients with CLL showed a higher absolute number of activated lymphocytes B with phenotypes CD19 + CD25 + and CD19 + CD69 + , as well as a higher absolute number of CD3 + CD25 + lymphocytes T than the controls. The enhanced activation of peripheral blood and bone<disease> marrow lymphocytes was associated with higher Rai stages , an increased concentration of lactate dehydrogenase and beta-2 microglobulin and the progression of the disease. The number of lymphocytes B CD19 + ZAP-70 + correlated positively with the number of CD19 + CD25 + B cells and CD3 + CD69 + T cells. The study confirmed the association between an unfavorable prognosis and a high expression of activation markers in CLL patients. The determination of CD25 + and CD69 + lymphocytes T and B constitutes a valuable diagnostic tool , completing the cytometric evaluation of CLL.
