  Matrikines are bioactive fragments of the extracellular matrix ( ECM) that are fundamental in regulating a diverse array of physiological processes. The tripeptide Proline-Glycine-Proline ( PGP) is a collagen-derived matrikine that has classically been described as a neutrophil chemoattractant. In this article , we describe our current understanding of the pathways that generate , degrade and modify PGP to dictate its bioavailability and stability. Additionally , we discuss our expanding appreciation of the capacity of PGP to regulate diverse cell types and biological processes , independent of its activity on neutrophils , including a putative role in wound<disease> repair. We argue that PGP functions as a primitive and conserved damage-associated molecular pattern , which is generated during infection or injury and subsequently acts to shape ensuing inflammatory and repair processes. As a fragment of the ECM that accumulates at the epicentre of the action , PGP is perfectly positioned to focus neutrophils to the exact site required and direct a localised repair response. However , it is essential that PGP is efficiently degraded , as if this matrikine is allowed to persist then pathology can ensue. Accordingly , we discuss how this pathway is subverted in chronic lung diseases giving rise to persistent inflammation<symptom> and pathological tissue remodelling.
