  Coccidiosis is a costly parasitic<disease> disease<disease> to the poultry industry with multiple prevention methods being explored to control its impact. This study evaluated the feeding effects of β-glucans on performance and responses of chickens during a coccidiosis challenge. Cobb 500 male broilers ( n = 1280) were assigned to 1 of 8 treatment groups ( 8 replicate pens; 20 birds/pen) in a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement , including non-infected and Eimeria-infected birds fed for 28 d a control diet , control + BG ( 150 g/MT Algamune 50) , control + BGZn ( 100 g/MT Algamune 50 Zn) , and control + 0.01 % Salinomycin ( Sal). On d15 , birds in the challenge groups received a mixed Eimeria inoculum. Birds and feed were weighed weekly on a per pen basis to evaluate body<symptom> weight gain ( BWG) , feed intake ( FI) , and feed conversion ratios ( FCR). Lesion<symptom> scores were assessed 6 d post infection ( d21) on 3 birds per pen. Performance data were subjected to ANOVA and differences were established using the LS-MEANS statement with significance reported at P ≤ 0.05. There were minor differences in lesion<symptom> scores among the dietary treatments in the infected groups with reduced duodenal and cecal scores in the Sal group compared to the BGZn and BG groups , respectively. The coccidiosis challenge main effect resulted in a significant reduction in 0-28 d BW and FI. Dietary treatment resulted in non-significant effect on BWG , but Sal addition resulted in increased FI. A significant diet X challenge interaction resulted in higher FCR in the Eimeria-challenged birds supplemented with Sal and BGZn in comparison to the other challenged groups , likely due to reduced mortality in the challenged Sal and BGZn groups. Body composition analysis at d28 revealed that the Eimeria challenge reduced both fat and lean tissue contents , where the β-glucans and Sal birds had lower fat percent than control birds.
