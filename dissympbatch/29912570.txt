  Previous work had shown the ability of an aqueous leaf and stem extract of Cissus quandrangularis ( 300 mg of CQR , CQR-300) to improve components of metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MS) in overweight individuals. This small pilot study aimed to confirm the efficacy of CQR-300 in reducing the percentage body fat measured using two different methods-bioelectrical impedance assay versus dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA). The study was an 8-week double-blind , placebo-controlled pilot trial on 67 individuals who were requested by a dietary counselor to maintain their normal exercise and dietary routines. Participants were randomly divided into two groups , placebo ( 32 participants) and the CQR-300 group ( 35 participants) , and received 300 mg of corn starch or CQR-300 daily. Body fat was measured by bioelectrical impedance using a TANITA impedance meter and by DEXA , with blood samples taken at baseline and at 8 weeks for the measurement of lipid parameters. After 8 weeks of treatment , participants of the placebo group showed a 1.05 % decrease in body fat as determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis , but no difference using DEXA. In the same time period , the CQR-300 group had an 8.9 % and 12.8 % decreases in the body fat as measured by impedance and DEXA , respectively. These values were significantly ( p < 0.05) lower than the placebo. Compared with the placebo , the CQR-300 group demonstrated significant ( p < 0.05) decreases in the waist and hip circumferences , systolic and diastolic blood<symptom> pressures<symptom> , total cholesterol , triglycerides , fasting blood glucose , as well as leptin levels. On the contrary , there were significant ( p < 0.05) increases in HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin levels. CQR-300 administered as a single 300 mg dose daily was effective in reducing body fat as well as improving blood parameters associated with MS.
