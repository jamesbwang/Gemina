  Objective: To investigate the predictive role of neutrophil lymphocyte<symptom> ratio ( NLR) and the platelet lymphocyte<symptom> ratio ( PLR) as hematological inflammatory markers in cases of endometrial hyperplasia<disease> and cancer. Material and Method: This retrospective study was performed between 2005-2015 with 247 cases of 83 endometrial adenocarcinoma ( group 1) , 64 of endometrial hyperplasia<disease> ( group 2) and 100 controls ( group 3) who underwent a curettage due to abnormal uterine bleeding and had a normal histopathology in our tertiary clinic. The cases were chosen from patients without chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , that do not have infection or medication that could affect the systemic inflammatory response. Preintervention blood parameters were taken into account. The neutrophil/ lymphocyte<symptom> and platelet/lymphocyte ratios were and statistical comparisons of the groups were conducted. Results: The age distribution of 247 patients was between 26 and 85 years , and the mean age was 48.8 ± 8.92. The median age was 54 in group 1 , 46 in group 2 and 45 in group 3. The age was significant between group 1 and the other groups ( p = 0.001). Some 71 % of the cases were premenopausal and 29 % were postmenopausal , the latter being significantly more frequent in group 1 ( 62.7 %; p = 0.001). Of the cases with endometrial hyperplasia<disease> , 42 ( 65.6 %) had simple and 22 ( 34.4 %) have atypical-complex lesions<symptom>. The median NLRs in groups 1 , 2 , and 3 were 2.15 , 2.10 , and 1.92 , respectively , with median PLRs of 135.1 , 134.0 and 145.6. There was a statistically significant difference between the NLR measurements of the cases from different groups ( p = 0.048; p < 0.05). The NLR value for the endometrial adenocarcinoma group was significantly higher than for the control group ( p = 0.033; p < 0.05). The optimum cut-off value was calculated to be ≥ 4 , at which sensitivity was 20.5 % , specificity 99 % , positive predictive value ( PPV) 94.4 % and negative predictive value ( NPV) 60 %. Conclusion: The value of NLR ≥ 4 has predictive significance in distinguishing endometrial pathologies before intervention in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding. Simple , cheap and easy-to-perform , the NLR can be used as a potential hematological marker for endometrial malignancy.
