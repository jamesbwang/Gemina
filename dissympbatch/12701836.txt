  Non-conversion of sputum<symptom> smear and culture prolongs the infectivity of the patient and has been associated with unfavorable outcomes. We aimed to evaluate factors associated with persistent sputum<symptom> positivity at the end of two months of treatment of new case pulmonary tuberculosis<disease> ( TB). Data of 87 human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients with culture-positive drug-susceptible pulmonary TB admitted to local university hospital between September 2015 and September 2016 were reviewed. Factors associated with sputum<symptom> smear and/or culture positivity at the end of the second month of treatment were analyzed. Twenty-two patients ( 25.3 %) remained smear and/or culture-positive. Male sex , lower body mass index ( BMI) , unemployment , alcohol abuse , higher number of lobes involved and cavities on chest X-rays , shorter time to detection ( TTD) on liquid cultures , higher respiratory sample smear grading and colony count in solid cultures , higher C-reactive protein , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , leukocytosis , thrombocytosis , and anemia<symptom> were all significantly associated with persistent sputum<symptom> positivity. However , in the logistic regression analysis only male sex , lower BMI , alcohol abuse , higher radiological involvement , cavitation , higher smear grading , higher colony count in solid cultures and shorter TTD were determined as independent factors associated with persistent sputum<symptom> positivity at the end of 2 months of treatment. In conclusion , higher sputum<symptom> smear and culture grading at diagnosis , shorter TTD , higher number of lobes involved , cavitation , male sex , alcohol abuse , and lower BMI were independently associated with persistent sputum<symptom> positivity. These factors should be sought when distinguishing which patients will remain infectious longer and possibly have worse outcomes.
