  To assess the diagnostic value of ultrasound-guided ( US-guided) synovial biopsy in routine clinical practice in cases of acute and chronic arthritis<disease>. A retrospective , single-center study of US-guided synovial biopsies between 2003 and 2013. The clinical , laboratory , radiographic , synovial fluid , and histological and bacteriological results of synovial biopsies were analyzed. Arthritis<disease> was classified according to disease duration < 6 weeks ( AA) or â‰¥ 6 weeks ( CA). Synovial biopsy success rate was defined by the rate of capsular and/or synovial tissue analyzed. The diagnostic efficiency was defined by synovial biopsy success rate multiplied by the clinical utility ( validation of a diagnostic hypothesis leading to a specific therapy). One hundred seventy-six US-guided synovial biopsies ( 51 AA and 125 CA) were analyzed. Synovial biopsy success rate was 82.4 %. The diagnostic efficiency was 19.9 %. Among the acute<symptom> arthritis<disease> cases , 11 were septic. Only three patients had a positive biopsy culture while the synovial fluid puncture was of insufficient quantity to allow bacteriological analysis. The perivascular infiltration of neutrophils ( PMN) had a sensitivity of 81.8 % , a specificity of 84.2 % , and a positive likelihood ratio of 5.2 for the septic<disease> arthritis<disease> diagnosis. Among the chronic arthritis<disease> cases , no case of pyogenic<disease> septic<disease> arthritis<disease> was found. No histological lesions<symptom> , examined separately , were specific to a type of chronic inflammatory joint disease. US-guided synovial biopsies remain relevant for the diagnosis of septic<disease> arthritis<disease> , in cases of acute<symptom> arthritis<disease> when joint aspiration is not possible.
