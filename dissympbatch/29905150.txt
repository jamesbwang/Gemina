  Antibodies against the 65-kDa isoform of the intracellular enzyme , glutamate decarboxylase ( GAD65) , have been found in patients with limbic encephalitis<disease> and drug-resistant autoimmune epilepsy. We report a 22-year-old female who presented with new-onset seizures<symptom> and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Video-EEG captured unique , independent bitemporal-onset focal seizures<symptom> with impaired awareness and ictal asystole. An autoimmune epilepsy panel revealed elevated GAD65 antibodies in the serum ( 225 nmol/l) and CSF ( 2.78 nmol/l) , while (
