  The authors present a 60-year-old man with a partially thrombosed , intracranial vertebral artery aneurysm<disease>. A vascular channel in intra-aneurysmal thrombus was effectively identified with high-resolution cone beam CT ( DynaCT Micro: Siemens Medical Solutions , Erlangen , Germany). Pre-procedural vertebral angiogram implied a perforating artery arising from near neck of the aneurysm<disease> and DynaCT Micro performed before approaching to the lesion<symptom> demonstrated a vascular channel running in intra-aneurysmal thrombus which could not be distinguished from perforators with other imaging modalities. It was confirmed that perforators around the aneurysm<disease> were not identified and safely treated the aneurysm<disease> with stent-assisted coil embolization. High-resolution cone beam CT is enable to sharply visualize vessel lumens , thrombus , and intra-thrombus structures , and is useful to identify a vascular channel in intracranial partially thrombosed
