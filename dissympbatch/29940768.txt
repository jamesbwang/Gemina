  The incorporation of pegylated asparaginase ( PEG-ASP) into pediatric and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( ALL) protocols remains a worldwide therapeutic standard , however the safety profile is a challenge. We herein report , in adults , the toxicity of intravenous single dose of 1000 IU/m2 PEG-ASP administered in remission induction for ALL patients. Thirty two patients at median age at diagnosis of 32 years ( median 19-65) were included in this analysis. Most patients had B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( n = 26; 78 %) and 81 % of cases were dministration to first toxic symptoms was 7 days ( range 1-19). There were 4 ( 13 %) early induction deaths among those receiving PEG-ASP. All deaths were observed in patients â‰¥ 50 years after median of 5 days after PEG-ASP ( range 1-9). Three out of 4 patients had massive obesity. All expired patients had grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia<symptom> at the time of death , however sepsis<disease> was not present. Administration of PEG-ASP in induction remission for ALL patients resulted in a significant , but mostly reversible hepatotoxicity. This treatment should be administered in caution for older , obese patients.
