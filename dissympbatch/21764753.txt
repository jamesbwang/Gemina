  Chronic<disease> infections<disease> with non-cytopathic viruses constitutively expose virus-specific adaptive immune cells to cognate antigen , requiring their numeric and functional adaptation. Virus-specific CD8 T cells are compromised by various means in their effector functions , collectively termed T cell exhaustion<symptom>. Alike CD8 T cells , virus-specific CD4 Th1 cell responses are gradually downregulated but instead , follicular T helper ( T
