  Innate immunity plays an important role in orchestrating the immune response , and the complement cascade ( ComC) is a major component of this ancient defense system , which is activated by the classical- , alternative- , or mannan-binding lectin ( MBL) pathways. However , the MBL-dependent ComC-activation pathway has been somewhat underappreciated for many years; recent evidence indicates that it plays a crucial role in regulating the trafficking of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells ( HSPCs) by promoting their egress from bone<disease> marrow ( BM) into peripheral blood ( PB). This process is initiated by the release of danger-associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs) from BM cells , including the most abundant member of this family , adenosine triphosphate ( ATP). This nucleotide is well known as a ubiquitous intracellular molecular energy source , but when secreted becomes an important extracellular nucleotide signaling molecule and mediator of purinergic signaling. What is important for the topic of this review , ATP released from BM cells is recognized as a DAMP by MBL , and the MBL-dependent pathway of ComC activation induces a state of `` sterile inflammation<symptom> '' in the BM microenvironment. This activation of the ComC by MBL leads to the release of several potent mediators , including the anaphylatoxins C5a and
