  The genesis of rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) is complex and dependent on genetic background and exposure to environmental xenobiotic. Indeed , smoking is associated to developing and worsening pre-existing RA. Nevertheless , the mechanisms and cigarette compounds involved in the harmful processes have not been elucidated. Here , we investigated if the exposure to hydroquinone ( HQ) , an abundant pro-oxidative compound of cigarette and benzene metabolite , could worsen the ongoing RA. Hence , collagen-induced arthritis<disease> ( CIA) was induced in male Wistar rats by s.c. injection of 400 μg ( 200 μL) of bovine collagen type II emulsified in complete Freund 's adjuvant on day 1 , and a booster injection was performed on day 7. Exposures to nebulized HQ ( 25 ppm) , saline solution or HQ vehicle solution ( 5 % ethanol in saline) were carried out for 1 h , once a day , on days 21-27 after CIA induction. On day 27 , animals were euthanized and samples were collected for further analyses. Exposure to HQ caused loss of weight , intensified paw edema<symptom> , enhanced levels of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) and anti-citrullinated protein antibody ( ACPA) in the serum; augmented synoviocyte proliferation and influx of aril hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR) positive cells into the synovial membrane , altered collagen fibre rearrangement in the synovia , and synoviocytes isolated from HQ exposed rats secreted higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines , TNF-α and interleukin-1β. Associated , we point out HQ as an environmental pollutant that aggravates RA , suggesting its participation on worsening RA in smoking patients.
