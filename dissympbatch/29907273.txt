  Extracorporeal gas exchange is increasingly used for various indications. Among these are refractory acute<disease> respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> , including the acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> ( ARDS) , and the avoidance of ventilator-induced lung injury ( VILI) by enabling lung-protective ventilation. Additionally , extracorporeal gas exchange allows the treatment of hypercapnic respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> while helping to unload the respiratory muscles and avoid intubation and invasive ventilation , as well as facilitating weaning from the ventilator. These indications are based on a reasonable physiologic rationale but must be weighed against the costs and complications associated with the technique. This article summarizes current evidence and indications for extracorporeal gas exchange.
