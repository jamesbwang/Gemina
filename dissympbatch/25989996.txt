  Inflammation<symptom> is generally suppressed during hibernation , but select tissues ( e.g. lung) have been shown to activate both antioxidant and pro-inflammatory pathways , particularly during arousal from torpor when breathing rates increase and oxidative metabolism fueling the rewarming process produces more reactive oxygen species. Brown<disease> and white adipose tissues are now understood to be major hubs for the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses , yet how these potentially damaging processes are regulated by fat tissues during hibernation has hardly been studied. The advanced glycation end-product receptor ( RAGE) can induce pro-inflammatory responses when bound by AGEs ( which are glycated and oxidized proteins , lipids , or nucleic acids) or damage associated molecular pattern molecules ( DAMPs , which are released from dying cells). Since gene expression and protein synthesis are largely suppressed during torpor , increases in AGE-RAGE pathway proteins relative to a euthermic control could suggest some role for these pro-inflammatory mediators during hibernation. This study determined how the pro-inflammatory AGE-RAGE signaling pathway is regulated at six major time points of the torpor-arousal cycle in brown and white adipose from a model hibernator , The results of this study revealed that RAGE is upregulated as animals arouse from torpor in both types of fat , but AGE and DAMP levels either remain unchanged or decrease. Downstream of the AGE-RAGE cascade , An increase in RAGE protein levels and elevated mRNA levels of the downstream transcription factor
