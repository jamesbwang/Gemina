  Brucellosis<disease> is one of the most prevalent zoonotic diseases in the world , but its pathogenesis is not very clear. At present , it is thought that it may be related to the immunity of T cells. The conclusions of related studies are inconsistent , and its clinical significance is not explicit. We searched published articles in electronic databases up to December 2017 identified as relating to the clinical features of human brucellosis<disease> in China. Only eight studies had sufficient quality for data extraction. Meta-analysis showed a significantly decreased proportion of CD4 + T cells in human brucellosis<disease> patients compared to healthy subject individuals. The frequency of CD8 + T cells was significantly higher in human brucellosis<disease> patients than that in the healthy control group. The pooled analysis presented a significant decrease of the CD4 +/ CD8 + ratio in human brucellosis<disease> patients compared to healthy subjects. There is immunologic dysfunction of T lymphocyte<symptom> in patients with human brucellosis<disease> , the CD4 + and CD8 + T cells might be the important factors affecting the progress of
