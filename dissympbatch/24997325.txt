  Proton pump inhibitors ( PPI) have greatly improved the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. However , recent investigations have revealed that reflux symptoms persist in a substantial number of patients. Therefore , treatment strategies beyond PPI are urgently required. One such strategy may involve more reliable acid suppression , e.g. , with new acid inhibitory drugs. Furthermore , the rapid appearance of an acidic compartment in the proximal stomach after a meal , which is largely responsible for postprandial heartburn , requires a specific kind of therapy in addition to PPI which still needs to be established. Pharmacological augmentation of the lower esophageal sphincter may represent another approach to diminish reflux , but the clinical efficacy of compounds tested so far is limited. Altered e-sophageal perception represents a major component involved in the generation of reflux symptoms , particularly in non-erosive reflux disease , but effective pharmacological intervention is largely lacking. Presumed reflux-induced respiratory<symptom> symptoms<symptom> ( cough<symptom> , laryngitis , etc.) in the absence of typical esophageal symptoms ( e.g. , heartburn) remain a hot topic , but recent research points towards a hypersensitivity<disease> syndrome<disease> and only a minor role of gastroesophageal reflux. Treatment options for this condition are still pending.
