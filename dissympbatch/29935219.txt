  The lack of pathogen-protective , isotype-switched antibodies in patients with common variable immunodeficiency ( CVID) suggests germinal center ( GC) hypoplasia , yet a subset of patients with CVID is paradoxically affected by autoantibody-mediated autoimmune cytopenias<symptom> ( AICs) and lymphadenopathy<disease> We sought to compare the physical characteristics and immunologic output of GC responses in patients with CVID with AIC ( CVID+AIC) and without AIC ( CVID-AIC). We analyzed GC size and shape in excisional lymph node biopsy specimens from 14 patients with CVID+AIC and 4 patients with CVID-AIC. Using paired peripheral blood samples , we determined how AICs specifically affected B-and T-cell compartments and antibody responses in patients with CVID. We found that patients with CVID+AIC displayed irregularly shaped hyperplastic GCs , whereas GCs were scarce and small in patients with CVID-AIC. GC hyperplasia<disease> was also evidenced by an increase in numbers of circulating follicular helper T cells , which correlated with decreased regulatory T-cell frequencies and function. In addition , patients with CVID+AIC had serum endotoxemia associated with a dearth of isotype-switched memory B cells that displayed significantly lower somatic hypermutation frequencies than their counterparts with CVID-AIC. Moreover , IgG Patients with CVID+AIC do not contain mucosal microbiota and exhibit hyperplastic yet inefficient GC responses that favor the production of untolerized IgG
