  Victims of sudden infant death syndrome<disease> ( SIDS) are believed to have an underlying dysfunction in medullary homeostatic control that impairs critical responses to life threatening challenges such as hypoxia , hypercarbia and asphyxia , often during a sleep period. This failure is thought to result from abnormalities in a network of neural pathways in the medulla oblongata that control respiration<symptom> , chemosensitivity , autonomic function and arousal. Studies have mainly focused on the role of serotonin , 5-hydroxytyptamine ( 5HT) , although the neuropeptide substance P ( SP) has also been shown to play an integral role in the modulation of medullary homeostatic function , often in conjunction with 5-HT. Actions of SP include regulation of respiratory rhythm generation , integration of cardiovascular control , modulation of the baroreceptor reflex and mediation of the chemoreceptor reflex in response to hypoxia. Abnormalities in SP neurotransmission may , therefore , also play a significant role in homeostatic dysfunction of the neurotransmitter network in SIDS. This review focuses on the pathways within the medulla involving SP and its tachykinin NK1 receptor , their potential relationship with the medullary 5-HT system , and possible involvement in the pathogenesis of SIDS.
