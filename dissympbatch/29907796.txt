  SMARCB1 encodes a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex involved in chromatin remodeling. Pathogenic variants ( PV) in this gene can give rise to three conditions. Heterozygous loss-of-function germline PV cause rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome<disease> and schwannomatosis. Missense PV and small in-frame deletions in exons 8 and 9 result in Coffin-Siris syndrome<disease> , which is characterized by intellectual disability ( ID) , coarse facial features , and fifth digit anomalies. By a gene matching approach , individuals with a similar SMARCB1 PV were identified. Informed consent was obtained and patient data were collected to further establish genotype-phenotype relationship. A recurrent de novo missense PV ( c. 110G > A ;p. Arg37His) in exon 2 of SMARCB1 , encoding the DNA-binding domain , was identified in four individuals from different genetic centers. They shared a distinct phenotype consisting of profound ID and hydrocephalus<symptom> due to choroid plexus hyperplasia<disease>. Other shared features include severe neonatal feeding difficulties; congenital heart , kidney , and eye anomalies; obstructive sleep apnea; and anemia<symptom> The p.Arg37His PV in the DNA-binding domain of SMARCB1 causes a distinctive syndrome<disease> , likely through a gain-of-function or dominant-negative effect , which is characterized by severe ID and hydrocephalus<symptom> resulting from choroid plexus hyperplasia<disease>. This report broadens the phenotypic spectrum associated with PV in SMARCB1.
