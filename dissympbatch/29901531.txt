  Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy ( ENB) aids in the localization of lung lesions<symptom> for biopsy and/or to guide fiducial or dye marking for stereotactic radiation or surgical localization. This study assessed ENB safety in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) and/or poor lung function. NAVIGATE is a prospective , multicenter , observational study of ENB. This substudy analyzed the 1-month follow-up of the first 1000 enrolled subjects. COPD was determined by medical history. Pulmonary function testing ( PFT) results were collected if available within 30 days of the procedure. Procedure-related complications were captured. The analysis included 448 subjects with COPD and 541 without COPD ( COPD data missing in 11). One-month follow-up was completed in 93.3 %. Subjects with COPD tended to be older , male , and have history of tobacco exposure , asthma , and recent pneumonia<disease>. Nodule<disease> size , location , and procedure time were similar between groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the procedure-related composite complication rate between groups ( 7.4 % with COPD , 7.8 % without COPD , P = 0.90). Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scale grade â‰¥ 2 pneumothorax was not different between groups ( 2.7 % with COPD , 3.7 % without COPD , P = 0.47). COPD was not a significant multivariate predictor of complications. Severity of forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1) or diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide impairment was not associated with increased composite procedure-related complications ( ppFEV1P = 0.66 , ppDLCO P = 0.36). In this analysis , complication rates following ENB procedures were not increased in patients with COPD or poor pulmonary function. Because pneumothorax risk is not elevated , ENB may be the preferred method to biopsy peripheral lung lesions<symptom> in patients with COPD and/or poor pulmonary function testing.
