  Intracranial aneurysms<disease> ( IAs) are rare in the pediatric population and are usually considered difficult to treat with traditional microsurgery due to their complex morphology. Endovascular techniques have become the standard option for treating IAs in adults. More recently , flow diverters such as the Pipeline Embolization Device ( PED) are being widely adopted for unruptured IAs with safety and efficacy in adults , yet their use in the pediatric population is not well defined. In this paper we present a pediatric patient with a ruptured PCA aneurysm<disease> successfully treated with a PED and a review of the literature of the current status of PED use in this subset of patients. A previously healthy 4-year old boy presented in the emergency department with a subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> and an MRA suggested a right PCA ruptured dissecting aneurysm<disease>. After discussing treatment options with the parents , off-label use of PED device was chosen. Within 24 hours of onset , a single PED device was successfully deployed. At 6-month follow up the patient was fully recovered with mRS 0 and angiogram showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm<disease> and patency of the parent vessel. Even though PED is not FDA approved to treat IAs in children , the literature shows favorable outcomes with its use , thus it could be a feasible option to treat challenging cases that are more frequent in the pediatric population. Further studies with pediatric population are needed to determine whether this technology could be a viable and durable option in the treatment of pediatric
