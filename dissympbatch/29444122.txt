  In 2015 , a high number of refugees with largely unknown health statuses immigrated to Western Europe. To improve caretaking strategies , we assessed the prevalence of latent tuberculosis<disease> infection ( LTBI) in a refugee cohort. Interferon-Gamma release assays ( IGRA , Quantiferon) were performed in Most refugees were young , male adults. Overall , IGRA testing was positive in 17.9 % ( 95 % CI = 13.2 ‚Åª 23.5 %) of subjects. Positivity rates increased with age ( 0 % < 18 years versus 46.2 % > 50 years). Age was the only factor significantly associated with a positive IGRA in multiple regression analysis including gender , C reactive protein , hemoglobin , leukocyte , and thrombocyte count and lymphocyte<symptom> , monocyte , neutrophil , basophil , and eosinophil fraction. For one year change in age , the odds are expected to be 1.06 times larger , holding all other variables constant ( Observed LTBI frequencies are lower than previously reported in similar refugee cohorts. However , as elderly people are at higher risk for developing active tuberculosis<disease> , the observed high rate of LTBI in senior refugees emphasizes the need for new policies on the detection and treatment regimens in this group.
