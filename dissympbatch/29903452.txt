  Accumulating evidence points to a critical role for the human cerebellum in both motor and nonmotor behaviors. A core tenet of this new understanding of cerebellar function is the existence of functional subregions within the cerebellum that differentially support motor , cognitive , and affective behaviors. This cerebellar functional topography- based on converging evidence from neuroanatomic , neuroimaging , and clinical studies- is evident in both adult and pediatric populations. The sensorimotor homunculi in the anterior lobe and lobule VIII established in early tract tracing and electrophysiologic studies are evident in both task-based and resting-state human functional imaging studies. In patients , damage to the anterior cerebellum , extending into medial lobule VI , is associated with the cerebellar motor syndrome<disease>. The cerebellar posterior lobe , including vermal and hemispheric regions of lobules VI and VII , is reciprocally interconnected with cerebral association and paralimbic cortices. Resting-state and task-based neuroimaging studies show functional activation patterns in these regions during higher-level cognitive tasks , and lesions<symptom> of the posterior cerebellum lead to the cerebellar cognitive affective/Schmahmann syndrome<disease> with its characteristic intellectual and emotional impairments. The existence of cerebellar connectional and functional topography provides the critical anatomic substrate for a cerebellar role in both motor and nonmotor functions. It also establishes a framework for interpreting cerebellar activation patterns , cognitive and behavioral outcomes following cerebellar damage , and the cerebellar structural and functional differences reported in a range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.
