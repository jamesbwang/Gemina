  In recent years , with an increasing number of central venous access procedures and cardiac implantable electronic device implantation , the incidence of infective endocarditis<disease> ( IE) has become more prevalent. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography ( 2D-TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE) are a key part of the evaluation of IE , but advances in three-dimensional echocardiography have enabled a better spatial resolution and visualization of cardiac structures , allowing the identification of any valvular vegetations , abscesses<disease> , or nodules<symptom>. Herein , we report the usefulness of 3D-TEE in a difficult diagnosis of hemodialysis catheter<disease> endocarditis<disease> hidden in intracaval stent.
