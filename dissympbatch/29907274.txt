  Cardiogenic shock<symptom> is a clinical syndrome<disease> characterized by low cardiac output and sustained tissue hypoperfusion resulting in end-organ dysfunction and death. In-hospital mortality rates range from 50 % to 60 %. Urgent diagnosis , timely transfer to a tertiary or quaternary medical facility with critical care management capabilities and multidisciplinary shock<symptom> teams is a must to increase survival. Aggressive , hemodynamically guided medical management with careful monitoring of clinical and hemodynamic parameters with timely use of appropriate mechanical circulatory support devices is often necessary. As treatment options evolve , prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to define best practices that define superior clinical outcomes.
