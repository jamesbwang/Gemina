  Vitamin D might be promising to serve as an adjunctive therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis<disease> ( TB). However , the results remained controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vitamin D in patients with pulmonary TB. Medline , SCOPUS , Google Scholar , EMBASE , Springer , and Science Direct were searched electronically from inception to Oct 2016. Randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) and controlled clinical trials ( CCTs) assessing the effect of vitamin D plus anti-tuberculosis treatment ( ATT) versus placebo plus ATT on the treatment of pulmonary TB were included. Two investigators independently searched articles , extracted data , and assessed the quality of included studies. Data were analyzed using RevMan 5.3 software. Five studies were included in this meta-analysis. Overall , compared with placebo intervention , vitamin D supplementation was found to have no significant effect on sputum<symptom> smear negative conversion rates ( RR = 0.99; 95 % CI = 0.91 to 1.07; Vitamin D supplementation showed no influence on the improvement of sputum<symptom> smear-negative conversion rates and BMI , as well as the decrease in ESR.
