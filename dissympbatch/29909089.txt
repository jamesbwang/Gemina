  To compare fetal , maternal , and operative outcomes of laparoscopic surgery versus laparotomy for major benign diseases including appendicitis<disease> , cholecystitis<disease> , adnexal masses , and uterine myoma during pregnancy. Retrospective cohort study ( Canadian Task Force classification II-2). The Diagnosis Procedure Combination database , a national inpatient database for acute-care inpatients in Japan. 6,018 eligible patients underwent abdominal surgery ( 4,047 laparotomy and 1,971 laparoscopy patients) from July 2010 through March 2016. The 2 groups were compared using propensity score matching analysis. The primary outcome was fetal adverse events , including abortion<disease> or stillbirth<symptom> within 7 days after surgery and premature delivery during hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were operative time , blood transfusion , and length of hospital stay after surgery. Propensity score matching created 740 pairs. Significant difference was observed in the primary outcome between propensity score-matched patients in the laparotomy versus laparoscopy group ( 1.8 % vs. 0.41 % , respectively; risk difference , -1.4 %; 95 % CI , -2.4 to -0.30; P = .01). Compared with the laparotomy group , the laparoscopy group had a significantly lower incidence of blood transfusion ( 2.3 % vs. 0.41 % , P = .002) , shorter operative time ( 115 min vs. 95 min , P < .001) , and shorter hospital stay ( 9.2 days vs. 5.9 days , P < .001). Our current study using propensity score matching suggests the advantages of laparoscopic surgery for benign diseases compared to laparotomy because laparoscopic surgery had advantages in short-term fetal adverse events , incidence of blood transfusion , operative time , and hospital stay.
