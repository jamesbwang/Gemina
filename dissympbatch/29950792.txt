  Visceral artery aneurysms<disease> are rare with an incidence of only 0.01-0.1 % of the population. Open surgical or endovascular elimination should be performed for aneurysms<disease> greater than 2 cm in size. The risk of aneurysm<disease> rupture is then approximately 25-40 %. If the aneurysm<disease> ruptures the mortality can be as high as 76 %. For mycotic aneurysms<disease> or spurious aneurysms<disease> there is no lower limit to the diameter size for the need of treatment. Sudden<symptom> abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> during pregnancy can be caused by visceral artery aneurysms<disease> and must be further clarified. The indications for surgery during pregnancy should be made generously. The clinical symptoms ( abdominal complaints) of visceral artery aneurysms<disease> are manifold. The treatment can be either an open surgical approach or endovascular treatment. In the emergency setting , if endovascular treatment is no longer possible , an open surgical treatment needs to be performed. There are so far no randomized studies which could identify one of the procedures ( open surgery vs. endovascular surgery) as clearly being superior. The prognosis after treatment is satisfactory with a 5-10 year survival rate of approximately 90 %.
