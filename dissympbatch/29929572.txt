  Apatinib is an oral TKI with anti-angiogenesis properties , and it is currently approved for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer in China. This agent has also been tested in other human solid tumors , including non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). Since the combination of chemotherapy and an anti-angiogenesis agent has been shown to be feasible strategy in NSCLC , it is conceivable that a similar approach combining apatinib with chemotherapy may yield clinical activity. With this in mind , we investigated the efficiency of apatinib in combination with pemetrexed or docetaxel in advanced NSCLC. We treated a total of 20 patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma NSCLC with apatinib in combination with either pemetrexed or docetaxel from January 2016 to March 2017. The performance status of these patients were 0 and 1. All of these patients had been previously treated with two or more lines of treatment and had experienced disease progression prior to study enrollment. The overall objective response rate ( ORR) was 30 % , with 6 partial responses ( PR) , 10 patients had stable disease ( SD) , and 4 patients had progressive disease ( PD). The main adverse events were skin<symptom> rash<symptom> , hypertension , palmar-planter erythrodysesthesia syndrome<disease> , diarrhea<disease> , and fatigue<symptom>. Nearly 30 % patients required interruption of treatment as a result of toxicity. Our study demonstrated that apatinib combined with systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy has clinical efficacy in patients with disease-refractory metastatic NSCLC and provides evidence for further studies investigating apatinib-based combination regimens.
