  Amyloid nephropathy is an uncommon disease that frequently presents with reduced kidney function and proteinuria<symptom> and , in developed nations , is most often associated with underlying paraproteinemia. The histologic appearance of glomerular amyloid deposition includes mesangial and capillary wall infiltration by an amorphous eosinophilic material , and features of endo- or extracapillary proliferation are not typically seen. Rare cases of crescentic injury have been reported in a subset of patients with amyloid nephropathy , particularly those with amyloid derived from serum amyloid A protein. Collapsing glomerulopathy , which like crescentic injury is associated with an extracapillary proliferation , has not to our knowledge been reported in the setting of amyloid nephropathy. We report 2 patients presenting with acute kidney injury and nephrotic syndrome<disease> found to have amyloid nephropathy with prominent epithelial cell hyperplasia<disease> and glomerular collapse on biopsy. This injury is likely multifactorial and related to direct podocyte injury and vascular compromise and expands further the spectrum of paraprotein-associated renal injury.
