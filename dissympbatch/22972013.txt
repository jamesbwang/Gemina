  Polyarteritis nodosa ( PAN) is a difficult-to-treat rheumatology disorder , and biologic agents have been used in such patients with a treatment failure or the disease relapse. We report a 42-year-old male Han Chinese who received adalimumab ( ADA) alone during his vasculitis relapse , manifesting with weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , ankle arthritis<disease> , testicular inflammation<symptom> and new-onset hypertension. Under the ADA 40 mg biweekly subcutaneous injection , there were the disappearance of clinical activity and no disease flares with a follow-up period of 26 months. The clinical observation in this patient suggests a potential efficacy of ADA therapy in controlling the disease activity of PAN.
