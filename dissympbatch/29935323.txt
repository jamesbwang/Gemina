  Orbital infarction syndrome<disease> ( OIS) is a rare entity defined as ischemia of all intraorbital and intra-occular structures including the optic nerve , extraocular muscles and orbital fat. This entity is rare due to rich anastomotic orbital vascularization from both the internal carotid artery and external carotid artery. We report a case of a patient who suffered ENT to the ophthalmic artery and external carotid artery which resulted in orbital infarction syndrome<disease> and describe techniques to avoid such complications. A 66 year old male presented to our institution with an acute ischemic stroke secondary to occlusion of the ICA terminus and M1 segment. The vessel was revascularized after one pass using a stent-retriever. Post-operative angiography demonstrated sluggish flow in the distal right ophthalmic artery as well as occlusion of the distal ECA. Twenty-four hours following the procedure the patient was noted to have complete ophthalmoplegia<symptom> of the right eye , proptosis , and conjunctival chemosis. CT angiogram demonstrated persistent occlusion of the distal right ophthalmic artery and ECA. The right optic nerve was swollen as were all extraocular muscles. A final diagnosis of orbital infarction syndrome<disease> was made given the clinical presentation , imaging findings and occlusion of all vascular supply to the orbit on both conventional angiography and 24 hour CTA. OIS is a rare entity that has not been previously described as a complication of mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke. OIS should be considered when patients present with blindness<symptom> , orbital pain , and total ophthalmoplegia<symptom> post-thrombectomy.
