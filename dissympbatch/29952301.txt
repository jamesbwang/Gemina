  The psychosocial impact of skin conditions is usually evaluated in research settings. To define predictors that can be used by dermatologists to refer patients for psychological consultation or psychotherapy using a simple screening instrument. A questionnaire to evaluate possible anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> ( 12-item General Health Questionnaire ( GHQ-12)) was routinely used over a period of two months in an Italian dermatological reference centre. Of 651 patients , 508 ( 78 %) completed the GHQ-12. Of the total sample , 35.2 % scored 4 or more ( psychological consultation suggested) , and 15.7 % scored 7 or more ( psychological consultation recommended). Probable depression<symptom> or anxiety<symptom> was more frequent in women than in men , in patients born in foreign countries , and in patients with leg ulcers<disease> , pemphigoid , and psoriasis. Our results indicate that a simple instrument may be useful for dermatologists to detect patients at risk of psychological problems and subsequently refer them for psychological consultation.
