  Extensive spinal epidural hydatidosis may contribute to extensive spinal cord compression. Multilevel laminectomy with surgical excision remains the gold standard for treating these lesions<symptom> which are typically invasive , and have a high recurrence rate. A 35-year-old female with recurrent extensive spinal epidural hydatid cysts<symptom> was treated with a limited laminectomy and uniquely with irrigation-aspiration with isotonic saline water through an epidural catheter under fluoroscopic guidance and x-ray control. The postoperative MRI documented the hydatid cysts<symptom> have collapsed and the patient 's paraparesis<disease> improved. She developed no disease recurrence or renewed deficits over the next 12 months. Through a laminectomy , an epidural catheter may be introduced under fluoroscopic guidance/x-ray control to uniquely irrigate with isotonic saline/aspirate and decompress-the epidural hydatid cysts<symptom>. This is particularly useful in patients with significant comorbidities , who are not candidates for more aggressive surgical decompression. Further , all patients should be continued on prolonged chemotherapy and should be monitored closely due to the high rate of recurrence of these
