  Poor<symptom> graft function ( PGF) is a life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT) and is characterized by defective hematopoiesis. Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) have been shown to support hematopoiesis , but little is known about the role of MSCs in the pathogenesis of PGF. In the current prospective case-control study , we evaluated whether the number and function of bone<disease> marrow ( BM) MSCs in PGF patients differed from those in good graft function ( GGF) patients. We found that BM MSCs from PGF patients expanded more slowly and appeared flattened and larger , exhibiting more apoptosis and senescence than MSCs from GGF patients. Furthermore , increased intracellular reactive oxygen species , p-p53 , and p21 ( but not p38) levels were detected in MSCs from PGF patients. Moreover , the ability of MSCs to sustain hematopoiesis was significantly reduced in PGF patients , as evaluated by cell number , apoptosis , and the colony-forming unit-plating efficiency of CD34
