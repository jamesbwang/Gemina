  Guanosine , a guanine-based purine , is an extracellular signaling molecule exerting anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects in several in vivo and in vitro injury models. We aimed to investigate its protective effects on 2 , 4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid ( DNBS)- induced colitis<disease> in rat. Rats were divided into five groups and colitis<disease> was induced by intracolonic instillation of DNBS ( 15 mg/rat). Guanosine ( 4 or 8 mg/kg) was administered for 6 days i.p. starting the day of the colitis<disease> induction. Body<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , stool<symptom> consistency , colon weight/length , histological analysis , myeloperoxidase activity ( MPO) and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were assessed. Immunoblotting of nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB) p65 protein levels and detection of oxidative and nitrosative stress markers were also performed. Guanosine , in a dose-dependent manner , significantly ameliorated the severity of DNBS-induced colitis<disease> , reducing body<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and diarrhea<disease> incidence , preventing the DNBS-induced macroscopic and microscopic damage to the colonic mucosa , and the MPO increase. Guanosine treatment also lowered interleukin-1β , interleukin-6 , and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α mRNA levels. Importantly , guanosine in DNBS rats down-regulated the expression of NF-κB p65 and the levels of reactive oxygen species and nitrite. In conclusion , guanosine exerts beneficial effects in DNBS-induced colitis<disease> in rats , through modulation of colonic inflammation<symptom> , downregulating of NFκB-mediated signaling.
