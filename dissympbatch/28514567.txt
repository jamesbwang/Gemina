  An optimal nutritional status is associated with better post-transplant outcomes and survival. Post-lung transplant nutrition management is however particularly challenging as lung recipients represent a very heterogeneous group of patients in terms of age , underlying diseases , weight<symptom> status<symptom> and presence of comorbidities. Furthermore , the post-transplant period encompasses several stages characterized by physiological and pathophysiological changes that affect nutritional status of patients and necessitate tailored nutrition management. We provide an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding nutritional requirements in the post-lung transplant period from the immediate post-operative phase to long-term follow-up. In the immediate post-transplantation phase , the high doses of immunosuppressants and corticosteroids , the goal of maintaining hemodynamic stability , the presence of a catabolic state , and the wound<disease> healing process increase nutritional demands and lead to metabolic perturbations that necessitate nutritional interventions. As time from transplantation increases , complications such as obesity , osteoporosis , cancer , diabetes , and kidney disease , may develop and require adjustments to nutrition management. Until specific nutritional guidelines for lung recipients are elaborated , recommendations regarding nutrient requirements are formulated to provide guidance for clinicians caring for these patients. Finally , the management of recipients with special considerations is also briefly addressed.
