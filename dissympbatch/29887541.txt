  The objective of this study was to identify health and education related predictors of employment/self-employment in the age between 60 and 69 years in Europe. Data were obtained from Survey of Health , Ageing and Retirement in Europe ( SHARE) study- Wave 6. Our final sample ( n = 13,447) was retrieved from 16 European Union member states , Switzerland and Israel. We used logistic regression model including education level , physical and mental health parameters to predict employment/self-employment vs. retired. Employment/self-employment was associated with higher education status , increased risk for depression<symptom> , and obesity , but with decreased risk for chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , loneliness and limitations in daily life activities. Age-appropriate working conditions , part-time options , and enhanced job characteristics may contribute to maintain a good health status and prevent negative aspects of work that can induce the risk for stress and
