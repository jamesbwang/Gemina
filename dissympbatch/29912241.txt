  Acute pericarditis<disease> is not uncommon in clinical practice and may occur either as isolated disease or as a manifestation of another disease ( known or still unknown). The etiology is varied and complex and a clinically-oriented approach to management is possible by identifying initial presentation features of high risk ( risk of complications or specific disease: fever<disease> > 38 Â°C , subacute course without acute<symptom> chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , large pericardial<symptom> effusion<symptom> , cardiac tamponade , and lack of response to empiric anti-inflammatory therapy) , that suggest admission and additional diagnostic evaluation. In any case , a prompt anti-inflammatory therapy at full doses till remission is warranted to prevent complicated and prolonged courses. In this paper , we will try to clarify common doubts and outline evidence-based approaches to the diagnosis , therapy and follow-up of these patients.
