  The protein kinase p38α plays a key role in cell homeostasis , and p38α signaling in intestinal epithelial cells protects against colitis-induced tumorigenesis. However , little is known on the contribution of p38α signaling in intestinal stromal cells. Here , we show that myeloid cell-specific downregulation of p38α protects mice against inflammation-associated colon tumorigenesis. The reduced tumorigenesis correlates with impaired detection in the colon of crucial chemokines for immune cell recruitment. We identify insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1) as a novel mediator of the p38α pathway in macrophages. Moreover , using genetic and pharmacological approaches , we confirm the implication of IGF-1 produced by myeloid cells in colon inflammation<symptom> and tumorigenesis. We also show a correlation between IGF-1 pathway activation and the infiltration of myeloid cells with active p38α in colon samples from patients with ulcerative colitis<disease> or colon cancer. Altogether , our results uncover an important role for myeloid IGF-1 downstream of p38α in colitis-associated tumorigenesis and suggest the interest in evaluating IGF-1 therapies for inflammation-associated intestinal diseases , taking into consideration IGF-1 signaling and immune cell infiltration in patient biopsies.
