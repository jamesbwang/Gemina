  Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias<symptom> ( CDA) are characterized by hyporegenerative anemia<symptom> with inadequate reticulocyte values , ineffective erythropoiesis , and hemolysis<symptom>. Distinctive morphology of bone<disease> marrow erythroblasts and identification of causative genes allow classification into 4 types caused by variants in CDAN1 , c15orf41 , SEC23B , KIF23 , and KLF1 genes. Identify pathogenic variants in CDA patients. Massive parallel sequencing with a targeted gene panel , Sanger sequencing , Comparative Genome Hybridization ( CGH) , and in silico predictive analysis of pathogenicity. Pathogenic variants were found in 21 of 53 patients studied from 44 unrelated families. Six variants were found in CDAN1: two reported , p.Arg714Trp and p.Arg725Trp and , four novel , p.Arg623Trp , p.Arg946Trp , p.Phe1125Ser and p.Ser1227Gly. Twelve variants were found in SEC23B: seven reported , p.Arg14Trp , p.Glu109Lys , p.Arg217Ter , c.835-2A > G , p.Arg535Ter , p.Arg550Ter and p.Arg718Ter and , five novel , p.Val164Leu , p.Arg190Gln , p.Gln521Ter , p.Arg546Trp , and p.Arg611Gln. The variant p.Glu325Lys in KLF1 was found in one patient and p.Tyr365Cys in ALAS2 in an other. Moreover , we identified genomic rearrangements by CGH in some SEC23B-monoallelic patients. New technologies for genetic studies will help to find variants in other genes , in addition to those known , that contribute to or modulate the CDA phenotype or support the correct diagnosis.
