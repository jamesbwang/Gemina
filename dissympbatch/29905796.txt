  This review aims to provide a translational perspective on recent developments in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF) , linking mechanistic insights to potential therapies. A key concept in this review is that HFpEF is a haemodynamic condition wherein the heart fails to keep up with the circulatory demands of the body , or does so at the expense of raised left ventricular filling pressures. We , therefore , propose that the ` final common pathway ' for development of congestion<symptom> , i.e. basic haemodynamic mechanisms of increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure , left atrial hypertension , pulmonary venous congestion<symptom> , and plasma volume expansion , represents important initial targets for therapy in HFpEF. Accordingly , we group this review into six mechanisms translating into potential therapies for HFpEF: beginning with three haemodynamic mechanisms ( left atrial hypertension , pulmonary hypertension , and plasma volume expansion) , and working backward to three potential molecular mechanisms ( systemic microvascular inflammation<symptom> , cardiometabolic functional abnormalities , and cellular ( titin)/ extracellular ( fibrosis<disease>) structural abnormalities).
