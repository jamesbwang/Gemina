  Leishmaniasis<disease> is a health-threatening vector-borne disease in almost 90 different countries. While a prophylactic human vaccine is not yet available , the fact that recovery from leishmaniasis<disease> establishes lifelong immunity against secondary infection suggests that a vaccine is attainable. In the past , deliberate infection with virulent parasites , termed Leishmanization , was used as a live-vaccine against cutaneous leishmaniasis<disease> and effectively protected against vector-transmitted disease in endemic areas. However , the practice was discontinued due to major complications including non-healing skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> , exacerbation of skin diseases , and the potential impact of immunosuppression. Instead , tremendous effort has been made to develop killed , live attenuated , and non-living subunit formulations. Many of these formulations produce promising experimental results but have failed in field trials or against experimental challenge with infected sand flies. Recently , experimental models of leishmanization have unraveled the critical role of parasite persistence in maintaining the circulating CD4
