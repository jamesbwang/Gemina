  Dental<disease> caries<disease> have a high prevalence in children and need to evaluate their individual and contextual determinants. To evaluate the importance of individual and contextual determinants on the occurrence of cavitated lesions<symptom> in 5-year-old children. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 769 preschoolers in a city in northeastern Brazil. Parents/caregivers answered questionnaires addressing psychological aspects , socio-demographic characteristics and the child 's oral health. The diagnosis of dental<disease> caries<disease> ( cavitated lesion<symptom>) was performed using the ICDAS-II. Variables related to the context were collected at the preschools and official municipal publications. Unadjusted and adjusted multilevel Poisson regression models with robust variance correction were used. The prevalence of cavitated lesions<symptom> was 58.8 %. In the analysis adjusted by individual determinants , low household income ( PR = 1.61; 95 % CI: 1.27-2.05) , lower parent 's/ caregiver 's schooling ( PR = 1.57; 95 % CI: 1.20-2.05) , not visited to the dentist ( PR = 0.77; 95 % CI: 0.62-0.94) , brushing frequency under 2 times per day ( PR = 2.17; 95 % CI: 1.35-3.51) and weak parent 's/ caregiver 's SOC ( PR = 1.30; 95 % CI: 1.09-1.56) were associated with cavitated lesions<symptom>. However , after the incorporation of the contextual determinants , parent 's/ caregiver 's schooling and SOC lost their association. Considering contextual factors , children attending public preschools ( PR = 1.66; 95 % CI: 1.34-2.05) and/or smaller preschools ( PR = 1.001; 95 % CI: 1.001-1.002) had a greater probability of exhibiting cavitated lesions<symptom>. Contextual variables were more important to the occurrence cavitated lesions<symptom> than individual socioeconomic variables.
