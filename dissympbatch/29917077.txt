  Leigh syndrome<disease> is a frequent , heterogeneous pediatric presentation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS) disease , manifesting with psychomotor retardation and necrotizing lesions<symptom> in brain deep gray matter. OXPHOS occurs at the inner mitochondrial membrane through the integrated activity of 5 protein complexes , of which complex V ( CV) functions in a dimeric form to directly generate adenosine triphosphate ( ATP). Mutations in several different structural CV subunits cause Leigh syndrome<disease>; however , dimerization defects have not been associated with human<disease> disease<disease>. We report four Leigh syndrome<disease> subjects from three unrelated Ashkenazi-Jewish families harboring a homozygous splice-site mutation ( c. 87 + 1G > C) in a novel CV subunit disease gene , USMG5. The Ashkenazi population allele frequency is 0.57 %. This mutation produces two USMG5 transcripts , wild-type and lacking exon 3. Fibroblasts from two Leigh syndrome<disease> probands had reduced wild-type USMG5 mRNA expression and undetectable protein. The mutation did not alter monomeric CV expression , but reduced both CV dimer expression and ATP synthesis rate. Rescue with wild-type USMG5 cDNA in proband fibroblasts restored USMG5 protein , increased CV dimerization and enhanced ATP production rate. These data demonstrate that a recurrent USMG5 splice-site founder mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish population causes autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome<disease> by reduction of CV dimerization and ATP synthesis.
