  Bovine leukemia<disease> virus ( BLV) is a retrovirus that infects B cells in cattle and causes bovine leukosis after a long latent period. Progressive exhaustion<symptom> of T cell functions is considered to facilitate disease progression of BLV infection. Programmed death-1 ( PD-1) and lymphocyte<symptom> activation gene-3 ( LAG-3) are immunoinhibitory receptors that contribute to T-cell exhaustion<symptom> caused by BLV infection in cattle. However , it is unclear whether the cooperation of PD-1 and LAG-3 accelerates disease progression of BLV infection. In this study , multi-color flow cytometric analyses of PD-1- and LAG-3-expressing T cells were performed in BLV-infected cattle at different stages of the disease. The frequencies of PD-1
