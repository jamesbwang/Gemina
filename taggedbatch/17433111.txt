 A 74-year-old male presented to us with a history of vision loss<symptom> for 36 hours in the right eye ( RE). The RE had a visual acuity of hand movements. The fundus revealed a pale retina , cattle tracking in the retinal vessels , and a cherry-red spot at the macula. The patient was a known case of pyoderma gangrenosum ( PG) and had received intravenous methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide at the onset of visual symptoms. An emergency anterior chamber paracentesis was performed following unsuccessful attempts of ocular massage. The patient improved to 6/9 in the RE 4 months after paracentesis. The patient had an aggressive course of PG , for which he needed a combination of oral steroid , immunomodulator therapy and biologicals. An association between central retinal arterial occlusion and PG has not been reported before , according to the best of authors ' knowledge.
