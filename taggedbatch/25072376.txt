 The depth limitation of conventional photodynamic therapy ( PDT) with visible electromagnetic radiation represents a challenge for the treatment of deep-seated tumors. To overcome this issue , we developed an X-ray-induced PDT system where poly ( lactide- Our results indicate that our nanoconstructs triggered by 6 MeV X-ray radiation yield enhanced PDT efficacy compared with the radiation alone. We attributed the X-ray-induced singlet oxygen generation from the PS , VP , to photoexcitation by Cherenkov radiation and/or reactive oxygen species generation facilitated by energetic secondary electrons produced in the tissue. The cytotoxic effect caused by VP offers the possibility of enhancing the radiation therapy commonly prescribed for the treatment of cancer by simultaneous PDT.
