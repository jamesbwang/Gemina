 To validate an objective scoring system for middle cerebral artery ( MCA) pulsed wave Doppler images. From an image database of routine 36-week scans , a random sample of MCA Doppler images was selected. Two reviewers rated the images subjectively as acceptable or unacceptable. Subsequently they used an objective 6-point image scoring system and awarded one point for each of: 1) anatomical site; 2) magnification; 3) angle of insonation; 4) image clarity; 5) sweep speed adjustment; and 6) velocity scale and baseline adjustment. Image scores 4-6 were defined as good quality whereas 0-3 as poor. The subjective and objective agreement between the two reviewers was compared using the adjusted Kappa statistic. A total of 124 images were assessed. Using objective scoring the agreement rate between reviewers increased to 91.9 % ( k = 0.839) compared to subjective agreement 75.8 % ( k = 0.516). The agreement for each criterion was: anatomical site 91.1 % ( k = 0.823); magnification 95.2 % ( k = 0.903); clarity 83.9 % ( k = 0.677); angle 96.0 % ( k = 0.919); sweep speed 98.4 % ( k = 0.968); velocity scale and baseline 94.4 % ( k = 0.887). Objective assessment of MCA Doppler images using a 6-point scoring system has greater interobserver agreement than subjective assessment and could be used for MCA Doppler quality assurance.
