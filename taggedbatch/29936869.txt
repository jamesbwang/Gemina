 In 1935 , the Russian linguist Prince Nicolai S. Trubetskoi and the French mythologist Georges Dumézil engaged in a vicious debate over a seemingly obscure subject: the structure of Northwest Caucasian languages. Based on unknown archival material in French , German , and Russian , this essay uses the debate as a pathway into the 1930s scientific and political stakes of IndoEuropeanism- the belief that European cultures emerged through the spread of a single IndoEuropean people out of a single `` motherland. '' Each of the two authors held strong commitments to visions<symptom> of European order and its origins- in `` Eurasia '' for Trubetskoi and a Northern European Heimat for Dumézil. The North Caucasus , long a privileged site for Russian and European scholars , now became key to the renegotiation of the origins and reach of imagined prehistoric IndoEuropean conquerors , but also the 1930s ' debate over the value of different disciplines ( linguistics , mythology , archaeology , folklore studies) for the origins of language , myth , and the European deep past. As a moment in the history of modern speculations about prehistory , pursued in the shadow of Nazi scholarship , the debate transformed fields of research- notably linguistics , comparative mythology , and structuralism- and the assumptions about the shape of Europe.
