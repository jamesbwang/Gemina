 Human pluripotent stem cells such as embryonic stem ( ES) and induced pluripotent stem ( iPS) cells , combined with sophisticated bioinformatics methods , are powerful tools to predict developmental chemical toxicity. Because cell differentiation is not necessary , these cells can facilitate cost-effective assays , thus providing a practical system for the toxicity assessment of various types of chemicals. Here we describe how to apply machine learning techniques to different types of data , such as qRT-PCRs , gene networks , and molecular descriptors , for toxic chemicals , as well as how to integrate these data to predict toxicity categories. Interestingly , our results using 20 chemical data for neurotoxins ( NTs) , genotoxic carcinogens ( GCs) , and nongenotoxic carcinogens ( NGCs) demonstrated that the highest and most robust prediction performance was obtained by using gene networks as the input. We also observed that qRT-PCR and molecular descriptors tend to contribute to specific toxicity categories.
