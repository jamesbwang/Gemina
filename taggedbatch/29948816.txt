 An 87-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to fever<symptom> and elevated liver enzymes. Computed tomography ( CT) scan revealed bile duct stones with a dilated biliary system , which confirmed the diagnosis of cholangitis. A 12-cm simple hepatic cyst<symptom> was also seen in the right liver , which had been detected on CT scan 5 years before , and did not change in size. Fever<symptom> did not subside even after endoscopic biliary drainage and a repeated CT scan showed an enlarged cyst<symptom> up to 14 cm , suggesting cyst<symptom> infection<disease>. An enlarged hepatic cyst<symptom> collapsed after percutaneous transhepatic drainage , along with resolution of fever<symptom>. Simple hepatic cysts<symptom> are common and most of them are asymptomatic. Infection of simple hepatic cysts<symptom> is a rare condition and the major entry route is considered as the biliary<disease> tract as communication between the biliary<disease> tract and cysts<symptom> is reportedly observed in those cases. However , in our case , no communication was seen on cholangiogram or cystogram on fluoroscopy and bilirubin level of the cyst<symptom> aspirate was low. Given the fact that patients with cholangitis are rarely complicated by hepatic cyst<symptom> infection<disease> , other routes of bacterial entry to simple hepatic cysts<symptom> should also be considered.
