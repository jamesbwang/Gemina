 Create a model , using reprogrammed cells , to provide a platform to identify the mechanisms of CGG repeat instability amongst female fragile X mental retardation 1 gene ( FMR1) premutation ( PM) carriers. Female PM carriers ( with and without POI) and healthy controls were enrolled from June 2013 to April 2014. Patient-derived fibroblasts ( FB) were reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSC) using viral vectors , encoding KLF4 , OCT4 , SOX2 , and MYC. FMR1 CGG repeat-primed PCR was used to assess the triplet repeat structure of the FMR1 gene. FMR1 promoter methylation ( %) was determined using FMR1 methylation PCR ( mPCR). Quantification of FMR1 transcripts by RT-qPCR was used to evaluate the effect of reprogramming on gene transcription , as well as to correlate patient phenotype with FMR1 expression. Production of FMR1 protein ( FMRP) was determined using a liquid bead array-based immunoassay. Upon induction to pluripotency , all control clones exhibited maintenance of progenitor cell CGG repeat number , whereas 10 of 12 clones derived from PM carriers maintained their input CGG repeat number , one of which expanded and one contracted. As compared to parent FB , iPSC clones exhibited a skewed methylation pattern; however , downstream transcription and translation appeared unaffected. Further , the PM carriers , regardless of phenotype , exhibited similar FMR1 transcription and translation to the controls. This is the first study to establish a stem cell model aimed to understand FMR1 CGG repeat instability amongst female PM carriers. Our preliminary data indicate that CGG repeat number , transcription , and translation are conserved upon induction to pluripotency.
