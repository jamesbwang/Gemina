 Particular applications in preclinical magnetic resonance imaging require the entire body of an animal to be imaged with sufficient quality. This is usually performed by combining regions scanned with small coils with high sensitivity or long scans using large coils with low sensitivity. Here , a metamaterial-inspired design employing a parallel array of wires operating on the principle of eigenmode hybridization was used to produce a small-animal imaging coil. The coil field distribution responsible for the coil field of view and sensitivity was simulated in an electromagnetic simulation package and the coil geometrical parameters were optimized for whole-body imaging. A prototype coil was then manufactured and assembled using brass telescopic tubes with copper plates as distributed capacitance. Its field distribution was measured experimentally using the B
