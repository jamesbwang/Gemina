 To study endometrial receptivity in infertile women with external genital endometriosis ( EGE). Clinical , morphological , immunohistochemical , and molecular genetic examinations of endometrial aspiration pipelle biopsy specimens obtained on days 22-24 of the menstrual cycle from 94 infertile women with endometriosis: 50 women with Stage I-II EGE and 44 women with ovarian endometrioid cysts<symptom> ( OEC). A control group consisted of 54 women with tubal peritoneal factor of infertility<symptom> ( TPFI) and a successful attempt at IVF. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were found to contain a number of endometrial surface epithelial cells containing mature pinopods. The expression levels of leukemia<disease> inhibitory factor ( LIF) , HOXA-10 , glycodelin A , avβ3 integrin , estrogen receptors ( ER) and progesterone receptors ( PR) , aromatase in the superficial epithelium , glandular epithelium and endometrial stroma were immunohistochemically revealed. Forty-four patients , including 17 with Stage I-II EGE and 27 with TPFI , showed mRNA expression levels of leukemia<disease> inhibitory factor receptor ( LIFR) , LIF , ER1 , PgR , HOXA-10 , and PTEN by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) with a preliminary reverse transcription PCR assay. It was established that in the infertile women with Stage I-II EGE and those with OEC , endometrial receptivity was impaired , which was manifested by a decline in the number of superficial epithelial cells containing mature pinopods , as well as a decrease in the endometrial level of the key receptivity markers: αvβ3 integrin , LIF , glycodelin A , and HOXA10 and increases in the synthesis of aromatase and in the imbalance of endometrial stromal expression of ER and PR detected by immunohistochemistry ( IHC). Molecular genetic study showed lower mRNA expression levels of the HOXA-10 , LIFR , and PgR genes , which confirms the data obtained by IHC.
