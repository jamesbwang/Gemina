 Despite the therapeutic usefulness of near-infrared irradiation ( NIR)- induced potent photothermal effects ( PTE) and photodynamic effects ( PDE) , they inevitably damage normal tissues , often posing threat to life when treating tumors adjacent to key organs or major blood vessels. In this study , the frequently overlooked , `` weak '' PTE and PDE ( no killing capability) are employed to synergize chemotherapy against multidrug resistance ( MDR) without impairing normal tissues. An NIR-responsive nanosystem , gold ( Au)- nanodot-decorated hollow carbon nanospheres coated with hyaluronic acid , is synthesized as a doxorubicin ( DOX) carrier with excellent photothermal and photodynamic properties. Upon low-level infrared irradiation , the mild heat of weak PTE moderately boosts DOX unloading , meanwhile the weak PDE moderately disturbs the P-glycoprotein function for retaining intracellular DOX by impairing mitochondrial ATP production. These two `` moderate '' alterations are quantitatively and functionally sufficient to augment the efficacy of chemotherapy in reversing MDR without damaging neighboring tissue. Thus , this work creates a gold-dot-decorated nanocarbon spheres based nanosystem for trimodal therapy , reveals the therapeutic value of the frequently ignored weak PTE/PDE , and demonstrates that synergizing with chemotherapy to overcome drug resistance does not necessarily require potent PTE/PDE.
