 For symptomatic metastasis of the long bones , intramedullary nailing has been the most accepted fixation method. Intramedullary nailing has effective control of pain , perioperative bleeding , and local tumor progression by augmentation with bone cement around the nail. Here , we report the preliminary results of a new surgical implant that allows for simultaneous injection of bone cement while inserting a percutaneous , flexible intramedullary nail. We performed palliative surgeries for long-bone metastasis using a multi-hole injection nail ( MIN) with multiple side holes in the distal one third. When the nail tip entered the metastatic cancer lesion<symptom> , the bone cement injection was started , and continued until the nail was completely seated. Ten patients with advanced cancer underwent palliative surgery using the new implant with simultaneous bone cement injection for humeral ( n = 4) , femoral ( n = 4) , and tibial ( n = 2) metastases. The mean operative time was 42 min ( range , 36-52 min). The mean length of the injection nail was 23.0 cm ( range , 18.0-33.0 cm) , and the mean volume of cement was 28.0 ml ( range , 14.0-40.0 ml). Marked pain palliation ( p < 0.001) and functional recovery ( p = 0.01) were verified. The mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society ( MSTS) functional score improved significantly from 12.5 at 6 weeks preoperatively , to 24.9 postoperatively. No acute postoperative complications , including cement embolism , occurred. This minimally invasive surgical method with MIN could be useful for stabilization of long-bone metastases in patients with advanced cancer.
