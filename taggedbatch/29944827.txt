 1- ( Propargyl) indol-2-carbonitriles react with alcohols to afford 1-alkoxypyrazino ( 1,2- a) indoles under DBU-catalyzed microwave-assisted conditions. The reaction scope includes a wide range of indoles , primary and secondary alcohols , and a thiol. The initial mechanistic study shows that the domino process presumably proceeds through an alkyne-allene rearrangement , imidate formation , and nucleophilic cyclization reaction sequence.
