 As aging involves oxidant injury , we examined the role of the recently described Na/K-ATPase oxidant amplification loop ( NKAL). First , C57Bl6 old mice were given a western diet to stimulate oxidant injury or pNaKtide to antagonize the NKAL. The western diet accelerated functional and morphological evidence for aging whereas pNaKtide attenuated these changes. Next , human dermal fibroblasts ( HDFs) were exposed to different types of oxidant stress in vitro each of which increased expression of senescence markers , cell-injury , and apoptosis as well as stimulated the NKAL. Further stimulation of the NKAL with ouabain augmented cellular senescence whereas treatment with pNaKtide attenuated it. Although N-Acetyl Cysteine and Vitamin E also ameliorated overall oxidant stress to a similar degree as pNaKtide , the pNaKtide produced protection against senescence that was substantially greater than that seen with either antioxidant. In particular , pNaKtide appeared to specifically ameliorate nuclear oxidant stress to a greater degree. These data demonstrate that the NKAL is intimately involved in the aging process and may serve as a target for anti-aging interventions.
