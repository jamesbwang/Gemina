 Understanding the interactions between a semiconducting nanocrystal surface and chiral anchoring molecules could resolve the mechanism of chirality induction in nanoscale and facilitate the rational design of chiral semiconducting materials for chiroptics. Now , chiral molybdenum oxide nanoparticles are presented in which chirality is transferred via a bio-to-nano approach. With facile control of the amount of chiral cysteine molecules under redox treatment , circular dichroism ( CD) signals are generated in the plasmon region and metal-ligand charge-transfer band. The obtained enhanced CD signals with tunable lineshapes illustrate the possibility of using chiral molybdenum oxide nanoparticles as potentials for chiral semiconductor nanosensors , optoelectronics , and photocatalysts.
