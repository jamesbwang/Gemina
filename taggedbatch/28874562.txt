 Complex<pathogen> magnetic domain structures and the energy barriers between them are responsible for pseudo-single-domain phenomena in rock magnetism and contribute significantly to the magnetic remanence of paleomagnetic samples. This article introduces MERRILL , an open source software package for three-dimensional micromagnetics optimized and designed for the calculation of such complex structures. MERRILL has a simple scripting user interface that requires little computational knowledge to use but provides research strength algorithms to model complex , inhomogeneous domain structures in magnetic materials. It uses a finite element/boundary element numerical method , optimally suited for calculating magnetization structures of local energy minima ( LEM) in irregular grain geometries that are of interest to the rock and paleomagnetic community. MERRILL is able to simulate the magnetic characteristics of LEM states in both single grains , and small assemblies of interacting grains , including saddle-point paths between nearby LEMs. Here the numerical model is briefly described , and an overview of the scripting language and available commands is provided. The open source nature of the code encourages future development of the model by the scientific community.
