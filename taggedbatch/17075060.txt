 MAPKs play important roles in platelet activation. However , the molecular mechanisms by which MAPKs are regulated in platelets remain largely unknown. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot data showed that MEKK3 , a key MAP3K family member , was expressed in human and mouse platelets. Then , megakaryocyte/platelet-specific MEKK3-deletion (
