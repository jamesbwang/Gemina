 To evaluate the clinical benefits on image quality ( IQ) of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction ( ASIR) and model-based iterative reconstruction ( MBIR) in multiphasic liver CT compared to filtered back-projection ( FBP) , in patients and on phantoms using a novel task-based metric. Image data of 65 patients who underwent a routine multiphasic liver CT during a 1-month period were reconstructed with FBP , ASIR50 , ASIR80 , and MBIR. IQ was assessed qualitatively by ranking the most distal hepatic artery ( HA) and portal vein ( PV) visible; and quantitatively by measuring contrast-to-noise ratio ( CNR) of the liver parenchyma , HA and PV. IQ was compared between each reconstruction and correlated to CNR and detectability index ( d') measurements computed on phantoms scanned with the same CT protocol as for patients. HA and PV were seen more distally on MBIR and ASIR80 compared to FBP ( p â‰¤ 0.001). The CNR correlated weakly between patient and phantom ( r = 0.76 and 0.80 for HA and PV , respectively) , whereas d' correlated strongly with the division order of HA and PV ( r = 0.96 and 0.95 , respectively). MBIR and ASIR significantly improve the IQ of multiphasic liver CT , especially through better distal detection of HA and PV , in agreement with the adapted task-based metric d' estimated on phantoms.
