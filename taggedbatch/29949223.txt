 Hs-CRP , fetuin-A , and S100A12 are acute-phase proteins associated with many systemic<disease> diseases<disease> and conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical parameters and salivary Hs-CRP , fetuin-A , and S100A12 levels before and after nonsurgical periodontal treatments in the patients with periodontal<disease> diseases<disease>. A total of 54 subjects were divided into three groups of 18 patients each: periodontally healthy , gingivitis<disease> , and chronic periodontitis<disease>. Clinical periodontal parameters; salivary Hs-CRP , fetuin-A , and S100A12 levels; and salivary flow rates were evaluated at baseline and a month after the treatments. Fetuin-A and S100A12 were significantly lower and Hs-CRP levels were significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis<disease> and gingivitis<disease> groups than in the control group at baseline ( p < 0.01). For the gingivitis<disease> and chronic periodontitis<disease> groups , the posttreatment levels of salivary fetuin-A and S100A12 were higher than the baseline levels of the same ( p < 0.01). There was a negative correlation between Hs-CRP and fetuin-A and Hs-CRP and S100A12 ( p < 0.001) and a positive correlation between fetuin-A and S100A12 ( p < 0.05) at baseline. Salivary fetuin-A and S100A12 levels decreased with increasing severity of periodontal<disease> disease<disease>. These results suggest that salivary fetuin-A may play an important role as a negative acute-phase protein in periodontal<disease> diseases<disease>.
