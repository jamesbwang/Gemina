 MRI provides considerable advantages for imaging of patients with peritoneal tumor. Its inherently superior contrast resolution compared with computed tomography allows MRI to more accurately depict small peritoneal tumors that are often missed on other imaging tests. Combining different contrast mechanisms , including diffusion-weighted MRI and gadolinium-enhanced MRI , provides a powerful tool for preoperative and surveillance imaging in patients being considered for cytoreductive surgery and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
