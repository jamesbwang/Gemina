 Plant somatic cells can be reprogrammed by in vitro tissue culture methods , and massive genome-wide chromatin remodeling occurs , particularly during callus formation. Since callus tissue resembles root primordium , conversion of tissue identity is essentially required when leaf explants are used. Consistent with the fact that the differentiation state is defined by chromatin structure , which permits limited gene profiles , epigenetic changes underlie cellular reprogramming for changes to tissue identity. Although a histone methylation process suppressing leaf identity during leaf-to-callus transition has been demonstrated , the epigenetic factor involved in activation of root identity remains elusive. Here , we report that JUMONJI C DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 30 ( JMJ30) stimulates callus formation by promoting expression of a subset of LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN ( LBD) genes that establish root primordia. The JMJ30 protein binds to promoters of the LBD16 and LBD29 genes along with AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 ( ARF7) and ARF19 and activates LBD expression. Consistently , the JMJ30-deficient mutant displays reduced callus formation with low LBD transcript levels. The ARF-JMJ30 complex catalyzes the removal of methyl groups from H3K9me3 , especially at the LBD16 and LBD29 loci to activate their expression during leaf-to-callus transition. Moreover , the ARF-JMJ30 complex further recruits ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED 2 ( ATXR2) , which promotes deposition of H3K36me3 at the LBD16 and LBD29 promoters , and the tripartite complex ensures stable LBD activation during callus formation. These results indicate that the coordinated epigenetic modifications promote callus formation by establishing root primordium identity.
