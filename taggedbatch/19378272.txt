 Magnetoencephalography ( MEG) captures the magnetic fields generated by neuronal current sources with sensors outside the head. In MEG analysis these current sources are estimated from the measured data to identify the locations and time courses of neural activity. Since there is no unique solution to this so-called inverse problem , multiple source estimation techniques have been developed. The nulling beamformer ( NB) , a modified form of the linearly constrained minimum variance ( LCMV) beamformer , is specifically used in the process of inferring interregional interactions and is designed to eliminate shared signal contributions , or cross-talk , between regions of interest ( ROIs) that would otherwise interfere with the connectivity analyses. The nulling beamformer applies the truncated singular value decomposition ( TSVD) to remove small signal contributions from a ROI to the sensor signals. However , ROIs with strong crosstalk will have high separating power in the weaker components , which may be removed by the TSVD operation. To address this issue we propose a new method , the
