 The purpose of this evaluation was to evaluate the linear coefficient of thermal expansion ( LCTE) of 12 conventional glass ionomer ( GIC) and four resin-modified glass ionomer ( RMGI) restorative materials. GIC and RMGI specimens ( 2 mm × 5 mm × 5 mm) were fabricated ( n = 12) following manufacturer instructions and were placed in 0.2 M phosphate-buffered saline and stored at 37 °C and 98 % humidity for one week. Specimens had LCTE determined with a thermomechanical analysis ( TMA) unit using a 15 °C -50 °C heating cycle as well as a 50 °C -15 °C cooling cycle at a 5 °C/ min rate , using a 3-mm ball-point probe under 0.02 N probe pressure with all specimens kept saturated with PBS using a specially designed quartz container. Each specimen was tested three times , with the mean representing the specimen LCTE. Mean results between specimen heating and cooling were compared with paired Wilcoxon sign rank test , while results between materials were compared with Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn 's ( α = 0.05). GIC LCTE ranged from approximately 5 °C to 20 °C ppm ° K Under moisture conditions similar to the oral cavity , GIC materials overall had LCTE values closer to that reported for tooth structure. RMGI materials displayed higher values , which was thought to be related to the amount of resin in the matrix. A generally greater LCTE trend with cooling for all materials was noted , but the small magnitude of the difference is presently thought to be of minor clinical significance.
