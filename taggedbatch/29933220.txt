 An ultra-performance liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry ( UPLC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous quantitation of metronidazole and 2-hydroxymetronidazole in human plasma was developed and validated. Metronidazole and 2-hydroxymetronidazole were extracted from a small volume of human plasma ( 10 μL) by hydrophilic lipophilic balanced solid phase extraction on 96-well μ-elution plates. Chromatographic separation of analytes was achieved on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column ( 1.7 μm , 2.1 × 100 mm) using gradient elution with a blend of 0.1 % formic acid in water and 0.1 % formic acid in methanol at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. Mass spectrometric detection was achieved using multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM) in positive-ion electrospray-ionization ( ESI) mode. Ion transitions were optimized at m/z 171.85- > 127.9 for metronidazole and m/z 187.9- > 125.9 for 2-hydroxymetronidazole. The assay was linear for both analytes over the concentration range of 0.1-300 μM; intra- and inter-assay precisions and accuracies were < 13 %. Recoveries for metronidazole and 2-hydroxymetronidazole ranged from 88 to 99 % and 78 to 86 % , respectively. Matrix effects for metronidazole and 2-hydroxymetronidazole in plasma ranged from 102 to 105 % and 99 to 106 % , respectively. The method was successfully applied to determine metronidazole and 2-hydroxymetronidazole plasma concentrations in a pharmacokinetic study conducted in adults administered an oral dose of 500 mg metronidazole. Pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable to previously reported values. By design , this method is amenable to high sample throughput and has the potential to be automated.
