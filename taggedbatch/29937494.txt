 Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) have emerged as a promising treatment for inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>. The immunomodulatory effect of MSCs takes place both by direct cell-to-cell contact and by means of soluble factors that leads to an increased accumulation of regulatory immune cells at the sites of inflammation<symptom>. Similar efficacy of MSCs has been described regardless of the route of administration used , the inflammation<symptom> conditions and the major histocompatibility complex context. These observations raise the question of whether the migration of the MSCs to the inflamed tissues is a pre-requisite to achieve their beneficial effect. To address this , we examined the biodistribution and the efficacy of intraperitoneal luciferase-expressing human expanded adipose-derived stem cells ( Luci-eASCs) in a mouse model of colitis<disease>. Luci-eASC-infused mice were stratified according to their response to the Luci-eASC treatment. According to the stratification criteria , there was a tendency to increase the bioluminescence signal in the intestine at the expense of a decrease in the bioluminescence signal in the liver in the & ldquo; responder & rdquo; mice. These data thus suggest that the accumulation of the eASCs to the inflamed tissues is beneficial for achieving an optimal modulation of inflammation<symptom>.
