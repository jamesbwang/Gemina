 Human activities are accompanied by characteristic sound events , the processing of which might provide valuable information for automated human activity recognition. This paper presents a novel approach addressing the case where one or more human activities are associated with limited audio data , resulting in a potentially highly imbalanced dataset. Data augmentation is based on transfer learning; more specifically , the proposed method: ( a) identifies the classes which are statistically close to the ones associated with limited data; ( b) learns a multiple input , multiple output transformation; and ( c) transforms the data of the closest classes so that it can be used for modeling the ones associated with limited data. Furthermore , the proposed framework includes a feature set extracted out of signal representations of diverse domains , i.e. , temporal , spectral , and wavelet. Extensive experiments demonstrate the relevance of the proposed data augmentation approach under a variety of generative recognition schemes.
