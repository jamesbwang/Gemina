 This study measured a variety of within-exposure fear changes and tested the relationship of each with treatment outcomes in exposure therapy. We coded 459 videotaped exposure tasks from 111 participants in 3 clinical trials for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD; POTS trials). Within exposures , fear level was observed continuously and alongside exposure process. Fear change metrics of interest were selected for relevance to mechanistic theory. Fear decreases were classified by function; nonhabituation decreases were associated with observed nonlearning processes ( e.g. , avoidance) , whereas habituation decreases appeared to result from an internal and indirect process. Outcomes were posttreatment change in symptom severity , global improvement , and treatment response. Greater cumulative habituation across treatment was associated with larger reductions in symptom severity , greater global improvement , and increased odds of treatment response. Fear activation , fear variability , and nonhabituation fear decreases did not predict any outcomes. Exploratory analyses examined fear changes during habituation and nonhabituation exposures; higher peak fear during nonhabituation exposures was associated with attenuated global improvement. Habituation is conceptually consistent with multiple mechanistic theories and should continue to be investigated as a practical marker of initial extinction learning and possible moderator of the relationship between fear activation and outcome. Results support the importance of functional and frequent fear measurement during exposures , and discussion considers implications of these findings for future studies aiming to understand learning during exposure and improve exposure delivery.
