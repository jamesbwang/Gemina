 Anti-ganglioside antibodies are principally associated with autoimmune peripheral neuropathies. In these disorders , immune attack is inadvertently directed at peripheral nerve by autoantibodies that target glycan structures borne by glycolipids , particularly gangliosides concentrated in nerve myelin and axons. The most thoroughly studied disorder is the acute paralytic disease , Guillain-Barr√© syndrome<disease><symptom> ( GBS) in which IgG autoantibodies against gangliosides arise following acute<disease> infections<disease> , notably Campylobacter<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen><symptom> enteritis<disease><symptom>. Additionally , chronic autoimmune neuropathies are associated with IgM antibodies directed against many glycolipids including gangliosides. This introductory chapter briefly summarizes the immunological and pathological features of these disorders , focusing on the methodological development of antibody measurement and of animal models.
