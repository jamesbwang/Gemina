 The adoption of neat-fullerene ( C60 and C70) in polymer solar cells offers opportunities to develop cost-effective and thermally stable devices. Here , through rational side-chain engineering of low optical-gap polymer poly ( benzodithiophene-furan-diketopyrrolopyrrole) s ( PBDs) , we demonstrated for the first time a polymer/C70 blend exhibited higher efficiency ( best 6.1 %) compare to their polymer/ ( 70) PCBM ( best 5.7 %) counterparts , and the best efficiency is at the front of efficient polymer/neat-fullerene solar cells. More importantly , we first demonstrated the morphology optimization methodology for solution-processed polymer/neat-fullerene blends in order to reduce the strong crystallization and aggregation of neat-fullerene molecules. In comparison with previous work , these results can provide not only material design strategy but also fundamental difference between polymer/neat-fullerene and polymer/PCBM blend morphology , which allow us better understanding of how to choose proper materials and optimize blend morphology in polymer/neat-fullerene based device to deliver higher photovoltaic performance.
