 Dual energy computed tomography is becoming increasingly widespread in clinical practice. It can expand on the traditional density-based data achievable with single energy computed tomography by adding novel applications to help reach a more accurate diagnosis. The implementation of this technology in cardiothoracic vascular imaging allows for improved image contrast , metal artifact reduction , generation of virtual unenhanced images , virtual calcium subtraction techniques , cardiac and pulmonary perfusion evaluation , and plaque characterization. The improved diagnostic performance afforded by dual energy computed tomography is not associated with an increased radiation dose. This review provides an overview of dual energy computed tomography cardiothoracic vascular applications.
