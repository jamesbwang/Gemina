 Leigh Syndrome<disease><symptom> ( LS) is a rare , hereditary progressive neurodegenerative disorder of infancy or early childhood associated with a highly variable clinical presentation even among siblings. Further , genetic heterogeneity makes its diagnosis complicated. Its causative genetic variations are notified in some of the mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Here , we report an atypical case of LS in a 9-year-old boy associated with a novel variation in MT-ATP6 gene. The atypical findings were Bilateral Basal Ganglia Calcification ( BGC) and late survival age in the patient. Analyses of the Whole Mitochondrial Genome Sequencing ( WMGS) results of the recruited patient and his mother at different read coverage , first at 100 × and later repeated at 500 × , revealed a novel disease-associated variation in the already known disease-associated MT-ATP6 gene. In conclusion , the present study indicates amalgamation of both neuro-imaging and Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS) Technologies aiding the proper diagnosis of LS in atypical cases.
