 Localizing human brain functions is a long-standing goal in systems neuroscience. Toward this goal , neuroimaging studies have traditionally used volume-based smoothing , registered data to volume-based standard spaces , and reported results relative to volume-based parcellations. A novel 360-area surface-based cortical parcellation was recently generated using multimodal data from the Human Connectome Project , and a volume-based version of this parcellation has frequently been requested for use with traditional volume-based analyses. However , given the major methodological differences between traditional volumetric and Human Connectome Project-style processing , the utility and interpretability of such an altered parcellation must first be established. By starting from automatically generated individual-subject parcellations and processing them with different methodological approaches , we show that traditional processing steps , especially volume-based smoothing and registration , substantially degrade cortical area localization compared with surface-based approaches. We also show that surface-based registration using features closely tied to cortical areas , rather than to folding patterns alone , improves the alignment of areas , and that the benefits of high-resolution acquisitions are largely unexploited by traditional volume-based methods. Quantitatively , we show that the most common version of the traditional approach has spatial localization that is only 35 % as good as the best surface-based method as assessed using two objective measures ( peak areal probabilities and `` captured area fraction '' for maximum probability maps). Finally , we demonstrate that substantial challenges exist when attempting to accurately represent volume-based group analysis results on the surface , which has important implications for the interpretability of studies , both past and future , that use these volume-based methods.
