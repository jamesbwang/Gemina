 The Healthy Living Pharmacy framework , introduced in England in 2008 , provides a tailored approach to the implementation of pharmacy services locally , facilitated by qualified ` Health Champions ' ( HCs). The study aimed to evaluate the perceived value of the 1-day level 2 HC training by assessing knowledge and confidence of HC pre- and post-training , and changes in practice. The views of additional stakeholders on factors that either obstructed or facilitated pharmacy engagement are also explored. This study used a mixed method approach. Pre- and post-training surveys evaluating HC pre-existing knowledge and understanding of their role were used. Additionally , qualitative semi-structured interviews were undertaken with four key groups: participating pharmacists , non-participating pharmacists , Local Pharmaceutical Committee leads and Public Health Leads from Public Health England. A total of 354 pre-training evaluation surveys were completed on the training day ( 100 %) , compared to 54 post-evaluation postal surveys with a 19 % ( n = 54/282) response rate. The post-evaluation of the training indicated that 83 % ( n = 45) of qualified HC were actively implementing their new role , with observed increased confidence and service provision. From the 22 interviews conducted two major themes emerged including: Training and Impact. Training had a positive impact on staff knowledge and confidence plus service delivery. An immediate impact was observed in increasing HC knowledge and confidence , service delivery and awareness of facilities for patient sign-posting. There was no statistical evidence to support a positive effect stemming from training on services. However , it was identified that time and further training were needed to both provide and assess value within local public health.
