 This study aimed to investigate the effects of back-fat thickness ( BF) , at mating of sows , on placental lipotoxicity , oxidative stress , and inflammation<symptom>. We performed iTRAQ labeling-based proteomic analysis on term placentas obtained by vaginal delivery from BFI ( 15-20 mm , control) and BFII ( 21-27 mm , obese) sows formed according to BF at mating. Proteomic analysis revealed 413 proteins to be significantly different in placenta from BFII sows by ≥ 1.2-fold. Gene ontology ( GO) analysis identified proteins related to lipid metabolism and inflammatory response to be altered in placenta from obese sows. Indicative of a lipotoxic placental environment , increased placental lipid , and up-regulated mRNA expression of lipogenic genes , including ADRP ( p = .06) , PPARD , FASN , ACACA , DGAT1 , and LIPIN3 , were associated with decreased AMPK and increased activation of WNT signaling in placenta from BFII group ( p < .05). Furthermore , we observed a 18 % decrease in total antioxidant capacity ( TAC) , increased mRNA content of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 , IL-18 , and TNF-α , and increased activation of inflammatory NF-κB and JNK signaling in placenta from BFII sows that was significantly associated with macrophage accumulation ( p < .05). These findings suggest that maternal obesity aggravates a lipotoxic environment in pig term placenta that may be associated with placental dysfunction and impaired fetal growth.
