 The drug efflux mediated by P-glycoprotein ( P-gp) transporter is a major factor responsible for multidrug resistance ( MDR) of paclitaxel ( PTX). The efficient intracellular PTX delivery is a promising strategy for overcoming the MDR of tumor cells. A CD44 receptor targeting and endosome-pH sensitive dual functionalized hyaluronic acid-deoxycholic acid-histidine ( HA-DOCA-His) micellar formulation was developed to overcome MDR , and a CD44 receptor targeting hyaluronic acid-deoxycholic acid ( HA-DOCA) micelles was used as a comparison. Compared with Taxol solution and HA-DOCA micelles , the cytotoxicity of PTX loaded in HA-DOCA-His micelles against drug-resistant tumor cells was improved significantly and possessed superior MDR-overcoming performance; this phenomenon is due to the increased intracellular PTX delivery by CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway and endosome-pH sensitivity-mediated PTX triggering release. Upon pharmacokinetic study , PTX/HA-DOCA-His micelles demonstrated longer blood circulation time , larger AUC , decreased V
