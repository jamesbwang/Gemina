 Copper oxide nanoparticles ( CuO NPs) are widely used in various industrial applications , i.e. semiconductor devices , batteries , solar energy converter , gas sensor , microelectronics , heat transfer fluids , and have been recently recognized as emerging pollutants of increasing concern for human and marine environmental health. Therefore , the toxicity of CuO NPs needs to be thoroughly understood. In this study , we evaluated the potential role of oxidative stress in CuO NP toxicity by exploring the molecular response of Arbacia lixula embryos to three CuO NP concentrations ( 0.7 , 10 , 20 ppb) by investigating the transcriptional patterns of oxidative stress-related genes ( catalase and superoxide dismutase) and metallothionein , here cloned and characterized for the first time. Time- and concentration-dependent changes in gene expression were detected in A. lixula embryos exposed to CuO NPs , up to pluteus stage ( 72 h post-fertilization , hpf) , indicating that oxidative stress is one of the toxicity mechanisms for CuO NPs. These findings provide new insights into the comprehension of the molecular mechanisms underlying copper nanoparticle toxicity in A. lixula sea urchin and give new tools for monitoring of aquatic areas , thus corroborating the suitability of this embryotoxicity assay for future evaluation of impacted sites.
