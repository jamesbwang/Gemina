 There is little published experience with the use of over the scope clips ( OTSCs) in pediatric patients. The aim of this study is to present our single center experience utilizing OTSCs for non-variceal gastrointestinal bleeding METHODS:: This is a retrospective case series of pediatric patients who underwent endoscopic management of gastrointestinal bleeding during which OTSCs were utilized. 11 cases of OTSC utilization for hemostasis were identified in 10 unique patients between 11/2014 and 5/2016. The median age at intervention was 14.7 years ( range 3.9- 16.8 years) and median weight was 39 kg ( range 17.4- 85.8 kg). Technical success and hemostasis was achieved in all cases and there were no complications. Median follow-up was 32.9 months ( range 21.2- 39.4 months). All non-anastomotic ulcers<disease><symptom> ( 4) , polypectomy bleeding ( 2) , and sphincterotomy bleeding ( 1) had no evidence of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding at last follow-up. Two patients with anastomotic ulcerations required additional medical interventions. Our series demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of the OTSCs in the pediatric population for acute gastrointestinal bleeding throughout the GI tract. In our experience , it is effective for non-anastomotic ulcers<disease><symptom> , post-polypectomy bleeding and post-sphincterotomy bleeding even when other hemostatic techniques have failed. OTSCs may be less effective in the setting of anastomotic ulcerations , reaffirming the refractory nature of these lesions<symptom>.
