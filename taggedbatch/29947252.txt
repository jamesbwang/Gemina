 Ischemic heart disease , also known as coronary artery disease ( CAD) , poses a challenge for regenerative medicine. iPSC technology might lead to a breakthrough due to the possibility of directed cell differentiation delivering a new powerful source of human autologous cardiomyocytes. One of the factors supporting proper cell maturation is in vitro culture duration. In this study , primary human skeletal muscle myoblasts were selected as a myogenic cell type reservoir for genetic iPSC reprogramming. Skeletal muscle myoblasts have similar ontogeny embryogenetic pathways ( myoblasts vs. cardiomyocytes) , and thus , a greater chance of myocardial development might be expected , with maintenance of acquired myogenic cardiac cell characteristics , from the differentiation process when iPSCs of myoblastoid origin are obtained. Analyses of cell morphological and structural changes , gene expression ( cardiac markers) , and functional tests ( intracellular calcium transients) performed at two in vitro culture time points spanning the early stages of cardiac development ( day 20 versus 40 of cell in vitro culture) confirmed the ability of the obtained myogenic cells to acquire adult features of differentiated cardiomyocytes. Prolonged 40-day iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes ( iPSC-CMs) revealed progressive cellular hypertrophy; a better-developed contractile apparatus; expression of marker genes similar to human myocardial ventricular cells , including a statistically significant CX43 increase , an MHC isoform switch , and a troponin I isoform transition; more efficient intercellular calcium handling; and a stronger response to Î²-adrenergic stimulation.
