 Promoting a better understanding of statistical data is becoming increasingly important for improving risk comprehension and decision-making. In this regard , previous studies on Bayesian problem solving have shown that iconic representations help infer frequencies in sets and subsets. Nevertheless , the mechanisms by which icons enhance performance remain unclear. Here , we tested the hypothesis that the benefit offered by icon arrays lies in a better alignment between presented and requested relationships , which should facilitate the comprehension of the requested ratio beyond the represented quantities. To this end , we analyzed individual risk estimates based on data presented either in standard verbal presentations ( percentages and natural frequency formats) or as icon arrays. Compared to the other formats , icons led to estimates that were more accurate , and importantly , promoted the use of equivalent expressions for the requested probability. Furthermore , whereas the accuracy of the estimates based on verbal formats depended on their alignment with the text , all the estimates based on icons were equally accurate. Therefore , these results support the proposal that icons enhance the comprehension of the ratio and its mapping onto the requested probability and point to relational misalignment as potential interference for text-based Bayesian reasoning. The present findings also argue against an intrinsic difficulty with understanding single-event probabilities.
