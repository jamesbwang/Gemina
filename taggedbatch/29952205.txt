 α,β-Unsaturated primary amides have found numerous applications in drug development , organic materials , and polymer sciences. However , the catalytic synthesis of α,β-unsaturated primary amides via carbonylation of alkynes has long been an elusive endeavor. Here , we report a novel palladium-catalyzed hydroaminocarbonylation of alkynes with NH
