 Anemia<symptom> associated with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> is a frequent condition , which may lead to heart function deterioration by the activation of neuro-hormonal mechanisms. Therefore , a vicious circle is present in the relationship of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and anemia<symptom>. The consequence is reflected upon the patients ' survival , quality of life , and hospital readmissions. Anemia<symptom> and iron deficiency should be correctly diagnosed and treated in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. The etiology is multifactorial but certainly not fully understood. There is data suggesting that the following factors can cause anemia<symptom> alone or in combination: iron deficiency , inflammation<symptom> , erythropoietin levels , prescribed medication , hemodilution , and medullar dysfunction. There is data suggesting the association among iron deficiency , inflammation<symptom> , erythropoietin levels , prescribed medication , hemodilution , and medullar dysfunction. The main pathophysiologic mechanisms , with the strongest evidence-based medicine data , are iron deficiency and inflammation<symptom>. In clinical practice , the etiology of anemia<symptom> needs thorough evaluation for determining the best possible therapeutic course. In this context , we must correctly treat the patients ' diseases; according with the current guidelines we have now only one intravenous iron drug. This paper is focused on data about anemia<symptom> in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , from prevalence to optimal treatment , controversies , and challenges.
