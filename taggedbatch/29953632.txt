 The theory of social representations ( TSR) and discursive psychology ( DP) originated as different social psychological approaches and have at times been presented as incompatible. However , along the years convergence has also been acknowledged , and , lately , most of all , practised. With this paper , we discuss how versions of TSR focusing on self-other relations for examining cultural meaning systems in/through communication , and versions of DP focusing on discourse at cultural , ideological , and interactional levels , can come together. The goal is to help forge a stronger social-psychological exploration of how meaning is constructed and transformed in and through language , discourse , and communication , thus extending current understanding of social change. After presenting a theoretical proposal for integrating those versions of TSR and DP , we offer also an integrated analytical strategy. We suggest that together these proposals can , on one hand , help TSR systematize analyses of social change that are both more critical and better grounded in theorizations of language use , and , on the other , provide DP with analytical tools able to better examine both the relational contexts where the construction and transformation of meaning are performed and their effects on discourse. Finally , we give some illustrations of the use of this analytical strategy.
