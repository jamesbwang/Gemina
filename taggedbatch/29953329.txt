 ABO blood group is the most important blood type system for transfusion medicine. A paper-based analytical device ( PAD) for ABO blood typing has been proposed. The device was composed of Whatman No. 113 paper , an absorbent gel pad , and a 3D-printing cassette. The 3D-printing cassette contained two circular holes for display of letters `` A '' and `` B '' on the PAD. Whole blood was dropped onto hydrophilic letters A and B on the PAD , in which the anti-A and anti-B were pre-immobilized , respectively. An absorbent gel pad was used to adsorb excess blood sample and washing solution during the washing step. The particle size of agglutinated red blood cells ( RBCs) could not be eluted out of the paper by the elution solution. In contrast , non-agglutinated RBCs were washed out by means of elution solution. The devices could be used for real blood samples in a wide range of hematocrit levels , 21-59 %. Unknown blood group samples ( n = 500) were identified by the developed device and the results were compared with the conventional method , revealing 100 % accuracy. Because of its compact size with low-cost fabrication , the portable ABO blood typing device has great potential for point-of-care testing , particularly in developing countries.
