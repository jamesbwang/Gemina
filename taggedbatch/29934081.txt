 To describe an uncommon subset of fractured lunates in Kienböck disease that is salvageable by internal fixation. We performed a retrospective review for patients with Kienböck disease treated by internal fixation. Demographic data , objective and radiographic measurements , patient-reported outcome measures ( Disabilities of the Arm , Shoulder , and Hand and Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation) and pain ( visual analog scale) scores were collected. Of the 7 patients treated , 5 were available for review. At an average follow-up of 7.1 years ( range , 1.5-15 years) , all patients had activity-related wrist pain but were pain-free at rest. Radiographic assessment showed union in all lunates and a normal radioscaphoid angle and Stahl index. The modified carpal height ratio was reduced in 4 patients and normal in one. There was no observed narrowing or irregularity of the radiocarpal or midcarpal joints. Patient-reported outcome measures in 2 patients were unsatisfactory. Computed tomography of the lunate in Kienböck disease is an important investigative tool. A coronal split fracture of these lunates can be salvageable by internal fixation. Revascularization of the lunate can be performed when the fragment is of sufficient size. Therapeutic V.
