 The carotid blood flow following carotid endarterectomy ( CEA) is not fully understood. Computational fluid dynamics ( CFD) is a promising method to study blood flow. This study is to investigate local hemodynamic characteristics after CEA via the use of unenhanced magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA) and CFD. Eight carotid arteries with atherosclerosis and sixteen normal carotid arteries were included in this study. Time-of-flight ( TOF) and phase contrast ( PC) MRA were applied for the measurement of three-dimensional artery geometries and velocity profile under CFD simulation. The hemodynamic parameters of the proximal internal carotid artery ( ICA) including velocity , ICA/common carotid artery ( CCA) velocity ratio , mean , maximum , minimum and gradient of wall shear stress ( WSS Compared with pre-CEA , there was a significant reduction in post-CEA velocity , WSS Our preliminary results indicated that major flow dynamics were restored shortly following CEA , and CFD based on MRA measurements could be useful for quantitative evaluation of hemodynamic outcomes after CEA.
