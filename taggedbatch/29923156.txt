 Using optical coherence tomography ( OCT) , we found that there were morphological differences in the coronary intima between patients with vasospasm-induced acute coronary syndrome<disease><symptom> ( VACS) and those with stable variant angina. We investigated whether aspirin use would protect against chest<symptom> pain<symptom> recurrence in patients with VACS. A retrospective cohort study was performed. Patients with ST-segment elevation who were confirmed to have VACS by a provocation test were included. OCT was performed at the index event and when chest<symptom> pain<symptom> recurred to assess intimal morphology. Chest<symptom> pain<symptom> recurrence was defined as the first revisit to the emergency room with angina. Propensity score matching was performed between the aspirin and non-aspirin groups. For 48 months , 154 patients were followed ( 77 patients in each group). The baseline characteristics and OCT findings were well balanced between the two groups after propensity score matching. Myocardial infarction ( 17 vs. 3 % , p = 0.003) and chest<symptom> pain<symptom> recurrence ( 26 vs. 9 % , p = 0.006) occurred more frequently in the non-aspirin group than in the aspirin group. Multiple Cox regression analysis showed that aspirin use was a significant predictor of lower risk of myocardial infarction ( hazard ratio ( HR) 0.13; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.03-0.61) and chest<symptom> pain<symptom> recurrence ( HR 0.33; 95 % CI 0.12-0.71) during the follow-up period , after adjustments for relevant covariates including OCT findings. The use of aspirin may have a preventive effect on myocardial infarction and chest<symptom> pain<symptom> recurrence in patients with VACS. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm the result.
