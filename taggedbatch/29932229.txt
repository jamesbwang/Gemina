 Many members of the phylum Bacteroidetes such as Flavobacterium johnsoniae can glide over a solid surface: an ability called gliding motility. It can be usually observed on agar plates as thin , flat , spreading colonies with irregular , feathery edges; this phenomenon is called colony spreading. Colony spreading of F. johnsoniae on 1.5 % agar plates containing poor nutrients is dose-dependently inhibited by addition of D-glucose , as previously reported. Accordingly , here , we created mutants ( by transposon mutagenesis) that partially suppressed glucose-mediated inhibition of colony spreading. Among the isolates , we found that one had a transposon insertion in Fjoh_4565 , tentatively named mfsA , which encodes a major facilitator superfamily ( MFS) transporter previously shown to be required for growth on glucose , N-acetyl-glucosamine , and chitin. We constructed an mfsA deletion mutant and found that the mutant showed no glucose-mediated acceleration of growth or glucose uptake. The mfsA gene complemented the phenotype of a glucose-negative Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. These results suggested that the mfsA gene encodes the sole MFS transporter of glucose in F. johnsoniae and that glucose uptake is partially required for the glucose-mediated inhibition of F. johnsoniae colony spreading.
