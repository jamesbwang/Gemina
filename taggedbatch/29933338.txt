 Approximately half of the 55,000 very low birth-weight infants ( < 1500 g) born in the United States each year develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD). Many etiologies have been associated with the development of BPD , including aberrant temperature/humidity levels of artificial ventilation. The purpose of this literature review is to explore what is known regarding inspired air temperature/humidity levels from artificial ventilation in very premature infants , focusing on what levels these infants actually receive , and what factors impact these levels. PubMed , CINAHL , Scopus , and Web of Science were searched. Of the 830 articles retrieved , 23 were synthesized for study purpose , sample/study design , and temperature/humidity findings. Heating and humidification practices studied in neonatal ventilation did not maintain recommended levels. In addition , human neonatal studies and noninvasive neonatal ventilation research were limited. Furthermore , ventilation settings , environmental temperatures , and mouth<symptom> position ( in noninvasive ventilation) were found to impact temperature/humidity levels. Environmental temperatures and ventilatory settings merit consideration during artificial ventilation. In addition , aberrant temperature/humidity levels may impact infant body temperature stability; thus , employing measures to ensure adequate thermoregulation while receiving artificial ventilation must be a priority. This review underscores the need for further research into current warming and humidification techniques for invasive and noninvasive neonatal ventilation. A focus on human studies and the impact of aberrant levels on infant body temperature are needed. Future research may provide management options for achieving and maintaining target temperature/humidity parameters , thus preventing the aberrant levels associated with BPD.
