 The optimal implantation site of a new implantable cardiac monitor ( ICM) named Reveal LINQ Among 18 healthy volunteers , we assessed AEPs in 3 combinations through parasternal placement of 2 electrodes , ( i) in the 4th intercostal space ( ICS; site A/setting a; A/a) , ( ii) the same setting in the 5th ICS ( site B/setting a; B/a) , and ( iii) in a sagittal plane relative to the left sternal border at the 4th ICS ( site A/setting b; A/b) , and further measured AFPs in several body positions in all site-setting combinations: supine , left and right lateral decubitus , sitting , and standing. The degree of interference with TTE performance was assessed by placement of an imitation ICM in setting a at both sites A and B. Only the AEPs in A/a and B/a met the criteria ( AEP â‰¥ 0.3 mV) in all positions. The AEPs in the supine position with all combinations were higher than those achieved in other positions ( The B/a combination is optimal; however , the personal discomfort related to brassieres should be considered.
