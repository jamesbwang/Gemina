 Background Patients receiving anticancer therapies are frequently prescribed complex and high-risk medication regimens , which at times can result in medication misadventures. The objective of this review was to assess the effect of outpatient clinical pharmacy services on medication-related outcomes in patients receiving anticancer therapies , including patients undergoing radiotherapy. Methods A systematic review of original publications indexed in EMBASE , MEDLINE and Cochrane Library from June 2007 to June 2017. Eligible studies evaluated outpatient pharmacy clinic services for cancer patients and reported at least one medication-related quantitative outcome measure. Two authors independently reviewed full-text articles for inclusion , then extracted data and performed quality and risk of bias assessments. Results Of 908 identified publications , 13 met predefined eligibility criteria; 1 randomised control trial , 2 controlled cohort studies and 10 uncontrolled before-after studies. Many excluded studies described outpatient pharmacy services but lacked medication-related outcomes. All included studies had informative practice model designs , with interventions for drug-related problems including drug dose optimisation ( n = 8) , reduced drug interaction ( n = 6) and adverse drug reaction reporting ( n = 3). Most studies ( n = 11) reported on symptom improvement , commonly nausea<symptom> ( n = 7) and pain ( n = 5). Of four studies in radiotherapy cohorts , pharmacist involvement was associated with improved symptoms , satisfaction and wellbeing scores. Conclusion Few studies have objectively assessed outpatient pharmacy cancer services , even fewer in the radiotherapy settings. Although the results support these services , significant heterogeneity and bias in the study designs prohibit robust conclusions and further controlled trials are required.
