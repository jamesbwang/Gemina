 Efforts to improve treatment of pain using opioids have to adequately take into account their therapeutic shortcomings which involve addictiveness. While there are no signs of an `` opioid epidemic '' in Germany similar to that in the US , there is little data on the prevalence of prescription opioid misuse and addiction. Therefore , our objective was to screen primary care patients on long-term opioid therapy for signs of misuse of prescription opioids. We recruited 15 GPs practices and asked all patients on long-term opioid therapy ( > 6 months) to fill out a questionnaire including the `` Current Opioid Misuse Measure '' ( COMM ®) , a self-report questionnaire. Patients with a malignant disease were excluded. N = 91 patients participated in the study ( response rate: 75.2 %). A third ( 31.5 %) showed a positive COMM ®- Score which represents a high risk of aberrant drug behaviour. A positive COMM ®- Score showed a statistically significant correlation with a lifetime diagnosis of depression<symptom> and neck<symptom> pain<symptom>. While Germany does not face an `` opioid eoidemic '' , addictiveness of opioids should be considered when using them in chronic non-tumor pain. In our study population , almost every third patient was at risk and should therefore be followed up closely. Co-prevalence of depression<symptom> is a significant issue and should always be screened for in patients with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , especially thus with aberrant drug behaviour.
