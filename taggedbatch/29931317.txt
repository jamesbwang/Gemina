 Social workers help to maintain and improve the lives of children , their families and adult service users in the UK. However , while engagement is shown to be an important determinant of both patient and employee outcomes in related health care professions , the influence of engagement has not been demonstrated in social workers. To investigate the influence of employee engagement on perceived stress , turnover intentions , job satisfaction and presenteeism. A cross-sectional survey of members of one English social work organization including measures of engagement ( Utrecht Work Engagement Scale) , the Perceived Stress Scale and single-item measures of job satisfaction , turnover intentions and presenteeism. T-tests and Mann-Whitney analyses were conducted to investigate differences in these measures in high and low engagement scores. A total of 1049 responses were analysed; social workers with greater engagement had significantly lower stress and turnover intentions , less presenteeism and greater job satisfaction. Additionally , overall respondents had poor levels of perceived stress , turnover intentions and presenteeism. Employee engagement is significantly associated with a number of work-related outcomes in social workers in England. However , social workers seem to have high turnover intentions and presenteeism , and greater than average perceived stress.
