 Hydroxylation and fluorination of proline alters the pyrrolidine ring pucker and the trans: cis amide bond ratio in a stereochemistry-dependent fashion , affecting molecular recognition of proline-containing molecules by biological systems. While hydroxyprolines and fluoroprolines are common motifs in medicinal and biological chemistry , the synthesis and molecular properties of prolines containing both modifications , i.e. , fluoro-hydroxyprolines , have not been described. Here we present a practical and facile synthesis of all four diastereoisomers of 3-fluoro-4-hydroxyprolines ( F-Hyps) , starting from readily available 4-oxo-l-proline derivatives. Small-molecule X-ray crystallography , NMR spectroscopy , and quantum mechanical calculations are consistent with fluorination at C
