 To identify the main aspects that should be assessed in adults with chronic<disease> wounds<disease><symptom>. This was an integrative review of the scientific literature published between 2010 and early 2015 in the PubMed and Web of Science databases. Few studies exclusively address wound<disease><symptom> assessment. However , the review found many aspects to consider when assessing individuals with ulcers<disease><symptom> , grouped as follows: factors that significantly affect healing or the development of new wounds<disease><symptom> ( age , nutritional status , functional capacity , or comorbidities) , pyschosocial factors , and wound<disease><symptom> characteristics ( location , size , depth , type of tissue , time of evolution). The literature search did not result in any one aspect that must be considered when assessing chronic<disease> wounds<disease><symptom> , but a complex interaction of factors that include both physiological and social and psychological elements. Professionals should be aware of this multifactorial approach to achieve early detection of the development and evolution of ulcers<disease><symptom> and to intervene accordingly.
