 Protein aggregate myopathies ( PAM) represent a group of familial or sporadic neuromuscular conditions with marked clinical and genetic heterogeneity that occur in children and adults. Familial PAM includes myofibrillar myopathies defined by the presence of desmin-positive protein aggregates and degenerative intermyofibrillar network changes. PAM is often caused by dysfunctional genes , such as DES , PLEC 1 , CRYAB , FLNC , MYOT , ZASP , BAG3 , FHL1 , and DNAJB6. To retrospectively analyze genetic mutations and demographic , clinical , and morphological aspects of PAM in a French population. Forty-eight PAM patients ( 29 men , 19 women) were divided into two groups , those with genetically ( GIM) and nongenetically identified ( NGIM) mutations associated with myofibrillar myopathy. Age of myopathy onset ranged from 13 to 68 years. GIM group mutations ( 81.25 %) included DES ( 14) , ZASP ( 8) , FLNC ( 4) , MYOT ( 4) , BAG3 ( 1) , CRYAB ( 2) , and DNAJB6 ( 6). The MYOT subgroup displayed a significantly older onset age ( p = 0.029). Autosomal dominant inheritance was found in 74.3 % of GIM and 44.4 % of NGIM subjects. Overall , 22.9 % had Maghrebian heritage , 72.9 % Caucasian , and 4.2 % Asian. The most common clinical sign was distal muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> ( 66 %) followed by simultaneous distal and proximal<symptom> weakness<symptom> in 49 %. Eleven patients had contractures , one had a rigid spine , and five had respiratory<symptom> dysfunction<symptom>. GIM subjects had greater cardiac involvement ( 51.7 %) versus the NGIM group ( 33.3 %). The average serum creatine kinase level was 393 U/L in GIM and 382 U/L in NGIM subjects. Morphological analysis showed significant differences among GIM subgroups , including the number of vacuoles and regenerated fibers ( ZASP) , group atrophy ( ZASP) , and rubbed out fibers ( MYOT). Ultrastructural findings showed significant differences in intranuclear rods , Z-disc thickness , and intranuclear inclusions<disease> between gene mutation subgroups. Paracrystalline inclusions<disease> were present in three patients ( DNAJB6). The most frequent mutation in was in DES , followed by ZASP. GIM and NGIM PAM subjects showed similar results , suggesting that any unknown genes , which cause this disease have characteristics similar to those already described. Considering the complexity of clinical , morphological , and genetic data related to PAM , particularly myofibrillar myopathies , physicians should be careful when diagnosing patients with sporadic PAM.
