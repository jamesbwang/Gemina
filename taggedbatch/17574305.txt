 Vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide ( PACAP) are highly similar neuropeptides present in several tissues , endowed with immunoregulatory functions and other systemic effects. We previously reported that both neuropeptides reduce viral production in HIV-1-infected primary macrophages , with the participation of Î²-chemokines and IL-10 , and now we describe molecular mechanisms engaged in this activity. Macrophages exposed to VIP or PACAP before HIV-1 infection showed resistance to viral replication , comparable to that observed when the cells were treated after infection. Also , multiple treatments with a suboptimal dose of VIP or PACAP after macrophage infection resulted in a decline of virus production similar to the inhibition promoted by a single exposure to the optimal inhibitory concentration. Cellular signaling pathways involving cAMP production and activation of protein kinases A and C were critical components of the VIP and PACAP anti-HIV-1 effects. Analysis of the transcription factors and the transcriptional/cell cycle regulators showed that VIP and PACAP induced cAMP response element-binding protein activation , inhibited NF-kB , and reduced Cyclin D1 levels in HIV-1-infected cells. Remarkably , VIP and PACAP promoted G-to-A mutations in the HIV-1 provirus , matching those derived from the activity of the APOBEC family of viral restriction factors , and reduced viral infectivity. In conclusion , our findings strengthen the antiretroviral potential of VIP and PACAP and point to new therapeutic approaches to control the progression of HIV-1 infection.
