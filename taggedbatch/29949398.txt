 The determination of pathogen-specific antibody indices ( AIs) of CSF and serum is an essential cornerstone in assessing neurological diseases and demands reliable high precision. Various companies provide ELISA kits for the detection of respective antibody concentrations and base AI calculation on a single CSF/serum pair of optical densities ( ODs) , combined with selection rules. The remainder of OD measurements is not used. There is no averaging of measurement errors and result stabilization. OD data from Siemens Enzygnost ELISA measurements of 2012-2016 proficiency survey samples for measles/rubella/varicella zoster/herpes simplex virus ( MRZH) reaction ( INSTAND e.V.) were reanalyzed. Several reference methods for calculating Q values from ODs using multiple-point evaluation are described. The methods are based on the Î± method and the four-parameter logistic ( 4PL) equation. Statistical analysis shows standard deviations of relative AI differences from AI target values to be significantly lower if derived from multiple-point evaluation instead of single-pair evaluation. Thus , the virus-averaged hit rate of a 10 % target AI environment can be improved from 49 % up to 69 %. Waiving the usage of a standard curve in favor of parameter fitting significantly improves calculational precision for Siemens Enzygnost assays. Patient safety , diagnostic assay costs , and laboratory effectiveness might be improved for other test distributors as well.
