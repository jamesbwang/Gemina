 ABSTRACTThis study investigated concerns regarding the extensive use of hospitals by older people and subsequent long wait lists. We analysed complete individual-anonymous , 2014-2015 inpatient hospital data for all Canadian provinces and territories ( except Quebec). People aged 65 and older accounted for 37.0 per cent of all hospital episodes and 41.5 per cent of all admissions to intensive or coronary care units. Similarly , of all admitted individuals , 32.8 per cent were older. The data also revealed only 14.3 per cent of older Canadians living outside of Quebec were admitted to hospital one or more times that year. This study indicates that issues other than hospital use by older people should be addressed in Canada for improved hospital accessibility. Improved care of older persons is also indicated , as their higher risk of hospital admission , longer hospital stays , and dying in hospital could be from a lack of age-informed hospital and community services.
