 When encountering an excess of information , people are able to selectively remember high-value information by strategically allocating attention during the encoding period , termed value-directed remembering. This has been demonstrated in both the episodic verbal and visuospatial memory domains. Importantly , the allocation of attention also plays a crucial role in the binding of identity and location information in visuospatial memory. We examined how taxing attentional resources to various degrees during encoding might affect visuospatial memory and selectivity. Participants studied items paired with point values indicating their value in a grid display and were asked to maximize their point score ( a summation of the points associated with correctly remembered information). Participants viewed items under either a sequential or simultaneous presentation format and in either the presence or absence of a secondary tone discrimination task. While participants in the divided attention conditions recalled fewer item-location associations overall , participants in all encoding conditions prioritized high-value information in memory , providing further evidence that selectivity can be maintained even when attentional resources are taxed. However , differences between presentation formats emerged when conducting spatial resolution analyses examining errors. Errors in the simultaneous conditions were only influenced by item value when attention was full during encoding , while errors in the sequential conditions were not influenced by item value , regardless of available attentional resources. The results suggest participants can strategically allocate attention during encoding even under cognitively-demanding conditions and that gist-based visuospatial memory may only be influenced by information importance when adequate attentional resources are available.
