 Zebrafish primary motor neurons differ from each other with respect to morphology , muscle targets and electrophysiological properties. For example , CaP has 2-3-fold larger densities of both inward and outward currents than do other motor neurons. We tested whether the transcription factor Islet2a , uniquely expressed in CaP , but not other primary motor neurons , plays a role in specifying its stereotypic electrophysiological properties. We used both TALEN-based gene editing and antisense morpholino approaches to disrupt Islet2a function. Our electrophysiology results do not support a specific role for Islet2a in determining CaP 's unique electrical properties. However , we also found that the morphological phenotypes of CaP and a later-born motor neuron differed between islet2a mutants and morphants. Using microarrays , we tested whether the gene expression profiles of whole embryo morphants , mutants and controls also differed. Morphants had 174 and 201 genes that were differentially expressed compared to mutants and controls , respectively. Further , islet2a was identified as a differentially expressed gene. To examine how mutation of islet2a affected islet gene expression specifically in CaPs , we performed RNA in situ hybridization. We detected no obvious differences in expression of islet1 , islet2a , or islet2b in CaPs of mutant versus sibling control embryos. However , immunolabeling studies revealed that an Islet protein persisted in CaPs of mutants , albeit at a reduced level compared to controls. While we can not exclude requirement for some Islet protein , we conclude that differentiation of the CaP 's stereotypic large inward and outward currents does not have a specific requirement for Islet2a.
