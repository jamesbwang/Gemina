 Reef-building corals can increase their resistance to heat-induced bleaching through adaptation and acclimatization and/or by associating with a more thermo-tolerant strain of algal symbiont ( Symbiodinium sp.). Here , we show that these two adaptive pathways interact. We collected Acropora millepora corals from two contrasting thermal environments on the Great<pathogen> Barrier Reef: cooler , mid-latitude Orpheus Island , where all corals hosted a heat-sensitive clade C Symbiodinium , and warmer , low-latitude Wilkie Island , where corals hosted either a clade C or a more thermo-tolerant clade D. Corals were kept in a benign common garden to reveal differences in baseline gene expression , reflecting prior adaptation/long-term acclimatization. Model-based analysis identified gene expression differences between Wilkie and Orpheus corals that were negatively correlated with previously described transcriptome-wide signatures of heat stress , signifying generally elevated thermotolerance of Wilkie corals. Yet , model-free analyses of gene expression revealed that Wilkie corals hosting clade C were distinct from Wilkie corals hosting clade D , whereas Orpheus corals were more variable. Wilkie corals hosting clade C symbionts exhibited unique functional signatures , including downregulation of histone proteins and ion channels and upregulation of chaperones and RNA processing genes , putatively representing constitutive `` frontloading '' of stress response genes. Furthermore , clade C Symbiodinium exhibited constitutive expression differences between Wilkie and Orpheus , indicative of contrasting life history strategies. Our results demonstrate that hosting alternative Symbiodinium types is associated with different pathways of local adaptation for the coral host. These interactions could play a significant role in setting the direction of genetic adaptation to global warming in the two symbiotic partners.
