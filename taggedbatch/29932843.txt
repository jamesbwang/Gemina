 The upper Hudson River was contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCB) Aroclor mixtures from the 1940s until the late 1970s. Several well-established biomarkers , such as induction of hepatic cytochrome P450 monooxygenases , were used to measure exposure to PCBs and similar contaminants in birds. In the present study , Japanese quail eggs were injected with a PCB mixture based upon a congener profile found in spotted sandpiper eggs at the upper Hudson River and subsequently , RNA was extracted from hatchling liver tissue for hybridization to a customized chicken cDNA microarray. Nominal concentrations of the mixture used for microarray hybridization were 0 , 6 , 12 , or 49 μg/g egg. Hepatic gene expression profiles were analyzed using cluster and pathway analyses. Results showed potentially useful biomarkers of both exposure and effect attributed to PCB mixture. Biorag and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ® analyses revealed differentially expressed genes including those involved in glycolysis , xenobiotic metabolism , replication , protein degradation , and tumor regulation. These genes included cytochrome P450 1A5 ( CYP1A5) , cytochrome b5 ( CYB5) , NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase , glutathione S-transferase ( GSTA) , fructose bisphosphate aldolase ( ALDOB) , glycogen phosphorylase , carbonic anhydrase , and DNA topoisomerase II. CYP1A5 , CYB5 , GSTA , and ALDOB were chosen for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmation , as these genes exhibited a clear dose response on the array. Data demonstrated that an initial transcriptional profile associated with an environmentally relevant PCB mixture in Japanese quail occurred.
