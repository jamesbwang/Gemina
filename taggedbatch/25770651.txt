 Relatively little is known about patterns of health risk behaviors among Middle Eastern<disease> youth , including how these behaviors are related to perceived peer norms. In a sample of approximately 2,500 15-24 year old Palestinian youth , perceived engagement of general peers in alcohol consumption , drug use and sexual activity was substantially greater than youths ' own ( self-reported) engagement in these activities , suggesting a tendency to overestimate the prevalence of risk-taking behavior among peers. Individual participation in a risk behavior strongly covaries with the perceived levels of both friends ' and peers ' engagement in that behavior ( p = 0.00 in each case). In addition , significant clustering of risk behaviors is found: youth who participate in one risk behavior are more likely to participate in others. These findings for a rare representative sample of Middle Eastern<disease> youth are strikingly similar to those in the US and Europe. The clustering of behaviors suggests that prevention programs should be structured to deal with a range of connected risk behaviors for which certain youth may be at risk. The findings also suggest that adjusting expectations about peers ' behavior may reduce young Palestinians ' engagement in risk taking.
