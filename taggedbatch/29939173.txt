 Brain malformation is often caused by genetic mutations. Deciphering the mutations in patient-derived tissues has identified potential causative factors of the diseases. To validate the contribution of a dysfunction of the mutated genes to disease development , the generation of animal models carrying the mutations is one obvious approach. While germline genetically engineered mouse models ( GEMMs) are popular biological tools and exhibit reproducible results , it is restricted by time and costs. Meanwhile , non-germline GEMMs often enable exploring gene function in a more feasible manner. Since some brain diseases ( e.g. , brain tumors) appear to result from somatic but not germline mutations , non-germline chimeric mouse models , in which normal and abnormal cells coexist , could be helpful for disease-relevant analysis. In this study , we report a method for the induction of CRISPR-mediated somatic mutations in the cerebellum. Specifically , we utilized conditional knock-in mice , in which Cas9 and GFP are chronically activated by the CAG ( CMV enhancer/chicken ÃŸ-actin) promoter after Cre-mediated recombination of the genome. The self-designed single-guide RNAs ( sgRNAs) and the Cre recombinase sequence , both encoded in a single plasmid construct , were delivered into cerebellar stem/progenitor cells at an embryonic stage using in utero electroporation. Consequently , transfected cells and their daughter cells were labeled with green fluorescent protein ( GFP) , thus facilitating further phenotypic analyses. Hence , this method is not only showing electroporation-based gene delivery into embryonic cerebellar cells but also proposing a novel quantitative approach to assess CRISPR-mediated loss-of-function phenotypes.
