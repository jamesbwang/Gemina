 The effect of levothyroxine ( L-T4) on the learning and memory<symptom> impairment<symptom> induced by streptozotocin ( STZ) and brain tissue oxidative damage in rats was evaluated. An animal model of the Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) was established by intracerebroventricular injection of STZ ( 3 mg/kg) in male Wistar rats ( 250 ± 50 g). After that , the rats were treated for 3 weeks with L-T4 ( 10 , 100 μg/kg) or normal saline. Passive avoidance ( PA) learning and spatial memory were evaluated using shuttle box and Morris water maze ( MWM) , respectively. Finally , the rats were euthanized , their blood samples were collected for further thyroxine assessment and their brains were removed after decapitation in order to measure the oxidative stress parameters and brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF). In the MWM , latency ( s) increased in the AD rats compared with the normal control group while it decreased in the 10 μg/kg L-T4 injected AD rats compared with the AD group. In the PA , the latency for entering the dark compartment was lower in the AD group than in the normal control group and it decreased in the 10 μg/kg L-T4 injected AD rats. The low dose of L-T4 ( 10 μg/kg) reduced malondialdehyde concentration but increased thiols concentration , superoxide dismutase , catalase activities and BDNF level in hippocampal tissues of the AD rats. Injection of L-T4 ( 10 μg/kg) alleviated memory deficits and also improved factors of oxidative stress and BDNF level in the STZ-induced AD rats.
