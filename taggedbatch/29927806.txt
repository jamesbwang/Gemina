 Hyperkinetic movement disorders may be difficult to treat , but cases where patients respond to alcohol and/or drugs with similar effects have been described. We report the case of a 64-year-old man with tardive dyskinesia characterized by severe uncontrolled dystonic and myoclonic jerks of the face , shoulders , and arm and forearm muscles , which improved with oral sodium oxybate. Our case suggests the possibility to test sodium oxybate in patients with severe , drug-resistant hyperkinetic syndromes<disease><symptom> , especially when they are known to improve with alcohol.
