 ABCA1 is expressed in placental trophoblasts , such that when the expression level of ABCA1 changes , the function of trophoblasts dramatically changes. However , the mechanism by which ABCA1 affects the function of trophoblast cells remains unclear. Here , we used biochemical and transcriptomic to uncover the potential mechanism of the effect of ABCA1 on trophoblast function. HTR8/SVneo cells were either treated with the agonist T0901317 or transfected with siRNA to regulate ABCA1 expression levels. A human gene expression microarray was used to analyze the expression spectrum of ABCA1. Microarray results were confirmed by Western blotting and RT-PCR. Immunofluorescence allowed detection of the cellular localization of ABCA1 , CCL8 , CXCL10 , CXCL11 , and S1PR1 in HTR8/SVneo cells. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to test interactions among these proteins. Concomitant with an increase in ABCA1 expression , S1PR1 expression increased , whereas expression of CCL8 , CXCL10 , and CXCL11 decreased significantly; opposite effects were observed with a decrease in ABCA1 expression. Thus , changes in ABCA1 expression may lead to changes in downstream gene expression. Whereas the interaction between ABCA1 and S1PR1 was direct , interactions among ABCA1 and CCL8 , CXCL10 , and CXCL11 were indirect. We propose that , in conjunction with S1PR1 , ABCA1 regulates expression levels of CCL8 , CXCL10 , and CXCL11; this may lead to changes in the immune function of trophoblastic cells. Thus , we suspect that the effect of ABCA1 on trophoblast function may involve many biological processes , molecular function changes , and the activation of multiple signaling pathways.
