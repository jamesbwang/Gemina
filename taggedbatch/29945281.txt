 Here , we review the case of a 26Â 1/7 weeks ' gestation premature female infant born to a mother who intentionally ingested a large quantity of Tylenol , aspirin , quetiapine , and prenatal vitamins. The neonate subsequently had markedly elevated levels of both Tylenol and aspirin when checked on the first day of life. While overall clinically stable , the neonate did demonstrate coagulopathy as evidenced by abnormal coagulation studies. Both poison control and a pediatric gastroenterologist/hepatologist were consulted. She successfully tolerated a course of N-acetylcysteine; her subsequent Tylenol level was markedly decreased and the neonate exhibited no further effects of toxicity. The salicylate level decreased on its own accord. To our knowledge , this is the first report of a neonate at 26 weeks ' gestation that has been successfully managed for supratherapeutic concentrations of acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid secondary to maternal ingestion. While rare , this case may serve as a reference for the effectiveness of N-acetylcysteine in premature infants in such instances.
