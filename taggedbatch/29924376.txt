 Left ventricular ( LV) mechanics are impaired in patients with severe aortic stenosis ( AS). Transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR) has become a widespread technique for patients with severe AS considered inoperable or high risk for traditional open-surgery. This procedure could have a positive impact in LV mechanics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immediate effect of TAVR on LV function recovery , as assessed by myocardial deformation parameters. One-hundred twelve consecutive patients ( 81.4 ± 6.4 years , 50 % female) from 10 centres in Europe with severe AS who successfully underwent TAVR with either a self-expanding CoreValve ( Medtronic , Minneapolis , MN) or a mechanically expanded Lotus valve ( Boston Scientific , Natick , MA) were enrolled in a prospective multi-centre study. A complete echocardiographic examination was performed at baseline and immediately before discharge , including the assessment of LV strain using standard two-dimensional images. Echocardiographic examination with global longitudinal strain ( GLS) quantification could be obtained in 92 patients , because of echocardiographic and logistic reasons. Between examinations , a modest statistically significant improvement in GLS could be seen ( GLS % -15.00 ± 4.80 at baseline; -16.15 ± 4.97 at discharge , p = 0.028). In a stratified analysis , only women showed a significant improvement in GLS and a trend towards greater improvement in GLS according to severity of systolic dysfunction as measured by LV ejection fraction could be noted. Immediate improvement in GLS was appreciated after TAVR procedure. Whether this finding continues to be noted in a more prolonged follow-up and its clinical implications need to be assessed in further studies.
