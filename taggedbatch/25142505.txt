 Urinary schistosomiasis caused by A total of 975 ( 445 females and 530 males) pupils , aged 9-16 years , were tested for At baseline , 279 out of 975 of the children were infected , with light infections constituting 84.9 % and 15.1 % classified as heavy infection. After mass treatment with praziquantel , the prevalence rate dropped , slightly , to 20.3 % ( 63 out of 310) in 2011. However , it increased the following years up to 38 % ( 133 out of 350) in 2015 , with prevalence rates higher in males than females. The average number of heavy infection cases increased to 24.3 % ( 120 out of 494) after treatment , reducing cases of light infections to 75.7 % ( 374 out of 494). This study revealed that mass treatment with a single dose of praziquantel was not sufficient to significantly reduce the transmission of schistosomiasis. Further studies will need to evaluate whether multiple praziquantel treatments will be more therapeutically effective in limiting future incidences.
