 Proliferative vitreoretinopathy is a well-known cause of failure of retinal detachment surgery. The purpose of this case report is to illustrate the clinical occurrence and histopathology of a horizontal subretinal band ( `` clothesline '' configuration) creating recurrent and persistent retinal detachment. A 67-year-old Hispanic female with diabetes type 2 and a history of retinal detachment surgery in the left eye ( OS) presented with decreased vision OS. Best corrected visual acuity at this recent presentation was 20/80 OS. Clinical examination disclosed a recurrent inferior retinal detachment and a subretinal `` clothesline '' fibrotic band. Surgical removal of the subretinal band was performed. Histopathological evaluation of longitudinal and transverse sections of the band revealed a cable-like configuration composed predominantly of glial differentiation , RPE differentiation , and collagen , based on morphology and immunohistochemical staining. There was focal smooth muscle and neuroendocrine cell differentiation , as detected with smooth muscle actin ( SMA) and S100 staining , respectively. Cross-sections demonstrated pigmented fibrocellular tissue with foci of cells staining positive for S100 and keratin peripherally around the tissue , suggestive of RPE differentiation. Scattered foci of SMA-positive cells suggested mild myoblastic differentiation. This case report presents further information on the structure and orientation of the cellular components of subretinal band proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Cells suggestive of MÃ¼ller cell differentiation compose the central aspect of the band , alongside collagen fibers. RPE differentiation is variably present peripherally in the band , likely reflective of proliferating RPE encircling the subretinal fibrous tissue. A mild amount of myofibroblastic differentiation was present within the band of tissue , correlating with the clinical findings of subretinal tissue contraction and localized retinal detachment.
