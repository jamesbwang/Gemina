 The Action Plan for viral hepatites in the WHO European Region aims to eliminate them as a public health threat by the end of 2030. The hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) perinatal transmission is a problem of major concern. The aim of our study was to estimate the prevalence of HBV<pathogen> markers in pregnant women in Romania , as scientific evidence for recommending public health interventions. The serum samples were prospectively collected in randomly selected maternities , from pregnant women admitted for birth beginning with July 1st , 2016. Signed informed consent was requested and the confidentiality of personal data was assured. The laboratory investigations were performed in two regional public health laboratories. The prevalence of HBsAg was 5.1 %. Among HBsAg positives , the HBeAg was present in 7.4 % and the anti-HBeAb were detected in 55.6 % of the pregnant women. The results of the study were comparable to those in 2013 for the women of the same age group , which proves the need for established public health interventions leading to reducing , and halting HBV transmission in the population..
