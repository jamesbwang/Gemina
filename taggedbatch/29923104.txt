 We aim to establish a multicenter registry collecting clinical , imaging , and follow-up data for patients who undergo myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI) with the latest generation SPECT scanners. REFINE SPECT ( REgistry of Fast Myocardial Perfusion Imaging with NExt generation SPECT) uses a collaborative design with multicenter contribution of clinical data and images into a comprehensive clinical-imaging database. All images are processed by quantitative software. Over 290 individual imaging variables are automatically extracted from each image dataset and merged with clinical variables. In the prognostic cohort , patient follow-up is performed for major adverse cardiac events. In the diagnostic cohort ( patients with correlating invasive angiography) , angiography and revascularization results within 6 months are obtained. To date , collected prognostic data include scans from 20,418 patients in 5 centers ( 57 % male , 64.0 ± 12.1 years) who underwent exercise ( 48 %) or pharmacologic stress ( 52 %). Diagnostic data include 2079 patients in 9 centers ( 67 % male , 64.7 ± 11.2 years) who underwent exercise ( 39 %) or pharmacologic stress ( 61 %). The REFINE SPECT registry will provide a resource for collaborative projects related to the latest generation SPECT-MPI. It will aid in the development of new artificial intelligence tools for automated diagnosis and prediction of prognostic outcomes.
