 Non-enzymatic RNA replication may have been one of the processes involved in the appearance of life on Earth. Attempts to recreate this process in a laboratory setting have not been successful thus far , highlighting a critical need for finding prebiotic conditions that increase the rate and the yield. Now a highly parallel assay for template directed RNA synthesis is presented that relies on the intrinsic fluorescence of a 2-aminopurine modified G-quadruplex. The application of the assay to examine the combined influence of multiple variables including pH , divalent metal concentrations and ribonucleotide concentrations on the copying of RNA sequences is demonstrated. The assay enables a direct survey of physical and chemical conditions , potentially prebiotic , which could enable the chemical replication of RNA.
