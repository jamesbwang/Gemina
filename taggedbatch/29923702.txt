 Manipulation of light transmission/absorbance and reflection/emission has a great significance in smart windows and displaying media like liquid crystal. Here , we report the usage of an external electric field to reversibly switch the molecular spectra of a model molecule on the basis of its interaction with an electroresponsible polymer brush. Both the UV-vis absorbance spectrum and the fluorescence emission spectrum of the model molecule were confirmed to be electroswitchable. The electroswitchable spectra were experimentally demonstrated to be induced by the electroswitchable statuses of medium anionic poly-allyloxy hydroxypropyl sulfonate ( poly-AHPS) brush. Insightfully , the molecular aggregated status of model proflavine molecules could be electrically controlled via the electroresponsible poly-AHPS brushes and then the molecular spectra of the model proflavine molecule also could be electrically and controllably shifted. The success in the manipulation of molecular spectra opens up a wide range of applications not only for displaying but also for nonlinear optics , in vivo imaging , sensors , and environmental inspection.
