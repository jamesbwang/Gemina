 The globin gene superfamily has been well-characterised in vertebrates , however , there has been limited research in early-diverging lineages , such as phylum Cnidaria. This study aimed to identify globin genes in multiple cnidarian lineages , and use bioinformatic approaches to characterise the evolution , structure and expression of these genes. Phylogenetic analyses and in silico protein predictions showed that all cnidarians have undergone an expansion of globin genes , which likely have a hexacoordinate protein structure. Our protein modelling has also revealed the possibility of a single pentacoordinate globin lineage in anthozoan species. Some cnidarian globin genes displayed tissue and development specific expression with very few orthologous genes similarly expressed across species. Our phylogenetic analyses also revealed that eumetazoan globin genes form a polyphyletic relationship with vertebrate globin genes. Overall , our analyses suggest that a Ngb-like and GbX-like gene were most likely present in the globin gene repertoire for the last common ancestor of eumetazoans. The identification of a large-scale expansion and subfunctionalisation of globin genes in actiniarians provides an excellent starting point to further our understanding of the evolution and function of the globin gene superfamily in early-diverging lineages.
