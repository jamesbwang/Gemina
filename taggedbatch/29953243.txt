 Host cavitands and organic guest molecules independently adsorbed on silica particles when mixed and shaken in the presence of a few drops of water underwent intra- and interparticle migration to form capsular complexes that were not formed either in water or organic solvents. Importance of cavitand migration and tumbling on silica surface was established by demonstrating that covalently linked cavitands do not form capsular complexes. The encapsulated guests exhibited selective photochemistry as they do within an organic capsule in solution.
