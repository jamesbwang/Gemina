 Tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> ( TB) and HIV<pathogen> constitute the main burden of infectious<disease> diseases<disease> worldwide. Imprisonment is an important risk factor for contracting TB , especially among those living with HIV<pathogen>. This systematic review summarizes the available data on the prevalence of TB among HIV-positive prisoners; which may support improved targeted TB/HIV prevention plans. We electronically examined published studies up to December 2017 with the aim of finding articles that investigated the prevalence of TB in HIV-positive prisoners. MEDLINE , SCOPUS , Embase , and Web of Science electronic databases were searched with no restriction on language or time. A random effects model was used to conduct the meta-analysis and generate a summary estimate for the global prevalence of TB among HIV-positive prisoners; and subgroup estimates by continent. The meta-analysis included 22 studies published from 1992 to 2016. In total , 2,465 articles were retrieved and 22 papers met inclusion criteria. Eligible papers contained 220,101 prisoners , with 1,611 cases of TB in 6,126 HIV-positive subjects. Globally , the pooled prevalence of TB in HIV-positive prisoners was 32.6 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 27.5 % to 38.2 %; p-value for heterogeneity = 0.001). Results of the subgroup analysis by continent were as follows: Africa , 14 % ( CI: 8 % to 24 %); North/South America , 37 % ( CI: 31 % to 44 %); Asia , 35 % ( CI: 12 % to 68 %); and Europe , 25 % ( CI: 12 % to 45 %). The prevalence of TB among HIV-positive prisoners is high worldwide. Screening of TB in this population is essential for the treatment of both diseases. Syndemics of TB and HIV<pathogen> in prisoners during the past three decades have created an alarming situation across the world. Hence , coordinated policies are essential for the early identification and effective treatment of this vulnerable population.
