 Intra-molecular energy transport between distant functional sites plays important roles in allosterically regulating the biochemical activity of proteins. How to identify the specific intra-molecular signaling pathway from protein tertiary structure remains a challenging problem. In the present work , a non-equilibrium dynamics method based on the elastic network model ( ENM) was proposed to simulate the energy propagation process and identify the specific signaling pathways within proteins. In this method , a given residue was perturbed and the propagation of energy was simulated by non-equilibrium dynamics in the normal modes space of ENM. After that , the simulation results were transformed from the normal modes space to the Cartesian coordinate space to identify the intra-protein energy transduction pathways. The proposed method was applied to myosin and the third PDZ domain ( PDZ3) of PSD-95 as case studies. For myosin , two signaling pathways were identified , which mediate the energy transductions form the nucleotide binding site to the 50 kDa cleft and the converter subdomain , respectively. For PDZ3 , one specific signaling pathway was identified , through which the intra-protein energy was transduced from ligand binding site to the distant opposite side of the protein. It is also found that comparing with the commonly used cross-correlation analysis method , the proposed method can identify the anisotropic energy transduction pathways more effectively.
