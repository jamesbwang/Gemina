 High baseline YKL-40 serum levels are associated with drug resistance in several solid tumours. However , their role in predicting docetaxel ( DOC) resistance in prostate cancer ( PCa) is unknown. Pre-treatment serum levels of YKL-40 and prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) were analyzed in 109 castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who underwent DOC-therapy. Responsive patients were retreated by repeated series of DOC. Results were compared with the clinical parameters as well as overall ( OS) and disease-specific survival ( DSS). YKL-40 but not PSA serum levels were significantly higher in patients with baseline resistance to DOC ( p = 0.035). Higher YKL-40 and PSA levels were detected in patients with bone metastasis ( p = 0.032; p = 0.010) and in those who were not pre-treated with radical prostatectomy ( p = 0.011 , p = 0.008). High YKL-40 levels were associated with shorter OS ( p = 0.037) and DSS ( p = 0.017) in patients who received DOC in the first-line setting. In multivariable analysis , ECOG performance status ( p = 0.009) , presence of any metastases ( p = 0.016) and high PSA levels ( p = 0.005) remained independent predictors for DSS. YKL-40 may help to identify patients with baseline resistance to DOC and therefore may help to optimize treatment decisions. In accordance , high pre-treatment YKL-40 serum levels were associated with shorter OS and DSS in patients who received DOC as first-line therapy.
