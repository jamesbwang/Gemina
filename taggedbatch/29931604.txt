 The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of different levels of dietary supplementation and reproductive stages on dry matter intake , digestibility , milk<symptom> production<symptom> , and mineral metabolism in Santa Inês hair ewes. Two dietary supplement levels of 0.5 and 1.5 % , based on body<symptom> weight , were used. A total of 12 hair ewes ( six subjected to 0.5 and six subjected to 1.5 % of concentrate supplementation based on body weight-BW) of the Santa Inês breed were evaluated in a completely randomized design with fixed effects of supplementation level , period , and its interactions. Dry matter intake , digestibility , milk<symptom> production<symptom> , and mineral metabolism ( calcium ( Ca) , phosphorus ( P) , magnesium ( Mg) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) , type I insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-I) , parathyroid hormone ( PTH) , and osteocalcin ( OC)) were assessed. Dry matter digestibility was affected by the supplementation level ( during both pregnancy and lactation) , with higher values in ewes fed at a level of 1.5 % of BW. A significant interaction between treatment × reproductive stages was found for the Mg concentration. A period effect ( P < 0.05) on serum concentrations of P , Ca/P , Mg , and IGF-I was observed. Serum P concentrations were influenced ( P < 0.05) by treatments and reproductive stages. There were significant differences in the Ca/P ratio among the reproductive stages. The enzymatic activity of ALP and serum IGFI differed among reproductive stages. Ewes supplemented at a level of 1.5 % of BW produced 18.5 % more milk than ewes supplemented at a level of 0.5 % of BW. The use of 0.5 % of body<symptom> weight in concentrate supplementation is recommended for the reduction of production costs , without having an effect on the mineral metabolism of Santa Inês hair ewes.
