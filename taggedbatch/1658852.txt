 The study reported four experiments aiming to test the effects of the pre-exposure schedule and water deprivation on the generalization of a conditioned taste aversion in rats , with a particular focus on testing whether or not the concurrent schedule might enhance generalization. In two experiments , non-water-deprived rats received concurrent , intermixed , or blocked exposure to a sweet-acid solution and a salty-acid solution before conditioning of one of these compounds and testing of both flavors. During pre-exposure , the rats consumed a greater amount of the sweet-acid solution than the salty-acid solution ( Experiments 1 and 2) , consumption of the former increasing during pre-exposure while consumption of the latter decreased ( Experiment 1). Furthermore , consumption of the salty-acid solution was lower during concurrent than intermixed or blocked pre-exposure ( Experiment 1 and 2) while consumption of the sweet-acid solution was greater during intermixed than concurrent or blocked pre-exposure ( Experiment 1). It is discussed whether the pre-exposure schedule might modify stimulus perception beyond the mere enhancement of stimulus differentiation , by , for instance , affecting the palatability of gustatory stimuli. Evidence for enhanced generalization after concurrent pre-exposure was not found for either deprived ( Experiments 1 , 2 , and 3) or non-deprived rats ( Experiments 3 and 4) , with deprivation leading to a general increase in consumption of both the conditioned and test flavors. This then raised the question of whether or not concurrent pre-exposure to flavors always increases generalization between them. The present study highlights the importance of this issue for various accounts of perceptual learning.
