 Mucosal-associated invariant T ( MAIT) cells are innate T cells restricted by MHC-related molecule 1 ( MR1). MAIT cells express semi-invariant T-cell receptors TRAV1-2-TRAJ33/ 12/20 in humans and TRAV1-TRAJ33 in mice. MAIT cells recognize vitamin B2 biosynthesis derivatives presented by MR1. Similar to other innate lymphocytes , MAIT cells are also activated by cytokines in the absence of exogenous antigens. MAIT cells have the capacity to produce cytokines , such as IFNγ , TNFα , and IL-17 , and cytotoxic proteins , including perforin and granzyme B. MAIT cells were originally named after their preferential location in the mucosal tissue of the gut , but they are also abundant in other peripheral organs , including the liver and lungs. In humans , the frequency of MAIT cells is high in peripheral blood , and these cells constitute approximately 5 % of circulating CD3
