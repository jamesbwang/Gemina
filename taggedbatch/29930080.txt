 Annexins are cytosolic phospholipid-binding proteins that can be found on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. The extracellular functions of annexin include modulating fibrinolysis activity and cell migration. Despite having well-described extracellular functions , the mechanism of annexin transport from the cytoplasmic inner leaflet to the extracellular outer leaflet of the plasma membrane remains unclear. Here , we show that the transbilayer movement of phospholipids facilitates the transport of annexins A2 and A5 across membranes<symptom> in cells and in liposomes. We identified TMEM16F ( also known as anoctamin-6 , ANO6) as a lipid scramblase required for transport of these annexins to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. This work reveals a mechanism for annexin translocation across membranes<symptom> which depends on plasma membrane phospholipid remodelling.
