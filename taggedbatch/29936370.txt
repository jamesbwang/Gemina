 The plant hormone auxin plays a fundamental role in the growth and development of plants. However , because of its low concentration and many other interfering substances in plant tissues , the determination of auxins is still a challenging problem. To solve this problem , a kind of novel cellulose magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer micro-spheres ( CMMIPs) was prepared by entrapment technique in this study. The Fe
