 The photophysical and photobiological properties of a new class of cyclometalated ruthenium ( II) compounds incorporating Ï€-extended benzo ( h) imidazo ( 4,5- f) quinoline ( IBQ) cyclometalating ligands ( C ^ N) bearing thienyl rings ( n = 1-4 , compounds 1-4) were investigated. Their octanol-water partition coefficients ( log P
