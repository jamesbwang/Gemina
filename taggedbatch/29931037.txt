 The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition Spanish ( WISC-IV Spanish) is a translation and adaptation of the WISC-IV that is often used in neuropsychological evaluation of children and adolescents with acquired or developmental brain disorders. However , there is limited information on the factor structure of the WISC-IV Spanish when used with clinical populations. To address the potential effects of language and culture on the validity of the WISC-IV Spanish factor structure , this study examined the construct validity of the WISV-IV Spanish scores using confirmatory factor analysis in a clinical sample of Hispanic children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD). Participants included 148 children whose primary language was Spanish , who had a primary diagnosis of ADHD , and who had been administered the WISC-IV Spanish as part of a clinical evaluation ( mean age = 10.6 years; SD = 2.7). Confirmatory factor analyses were performed to evaluate if the WISC-IV Spanish was best explained by a 1- , 2- , 3- , 4- , or 5-factor model based on the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory. A 4-factor model composed of verbal comprehension , perceptual reasoning , working memory , and processing speed factors provided the best fit for the data ( comparative fit index = .95; root mean square error of approximation = .06). Findings for children with ADHD and LD support interpretation of WISC-IV Spanish Index scores based on the 4-factor model identified in Spanish- and English-speaking normative samples. Additional research with understudied clinical populations is warranted to address gaps in cross-cultural research.
