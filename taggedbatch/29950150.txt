 Introduction Mobile-technology-based interventions are promising strategies for promoting behavioural change in obese patients. The aims of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a text message intervention , and to assess the effects of the intervention on body mass index ( BMI) and self-reported behavioural change. Methods TELEFIT was a three-phase feasibility study comprising the following stages: ( a) the development of text messages; ( b) testing; and ( c) a quasi-experimental pilot study in which patients who were engaged in obesity/overweight educational groups in public primary care centres in Belo Horizonte , Brazil , were recruited. A bank of text messages was drafted and reviewed by an expert panel , text message delivery software was developed and tested , and a pilot study assessed patients before and after receiving the intervention using validated questionnaires and body measures. The data were analysed using the Wilcoxon test. Results A total of 46 patients completed the follow-up; 93.5 % were women and the median age was 42 years ( interquartile range ( IQR) 34-52 years). At four months , participants had a significant reduction in BMI ( median 31.3 ( IQR 28.2-34.6) vs. 29.9 ( IQR 27.2-34.6) kg/m
