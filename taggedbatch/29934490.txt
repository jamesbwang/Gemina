 Protein tyrosine sulphation is a post-translational modification best known for regulating extracellular protein-protein interactions. Tyrosine sulphation is catalysed by two Golgi-resident enzymes termed Tyrosyl Protein Sulpho Transferases ( TPSTs) 1 and 2 , which transfer sulphate from the co-factor PAPS ( 3 '- phosphoadenosine 5 '- phosphosulphate) to a context-dependent tyrosine in a protein substrate. A lack of quantitative tyrosine sulphation assays has hampered the development of chemical biology approaches for the identification of small molecule inhibitors of tyrosine sulphation. In this paper , we describe the development of a non-radioactive mobility-based enzymatic assay for TPST1 and TPST2 , through which the tyrosine sulphation of synthetic fluorescent peptides can be rapidly quantified. We exploit ligand binding and inhibitor screens to uncover a susceptibility of TPST1 and TPST2 to different classes of small molecules , including the anti-angiogenic compound suramin and the kinase inhibitor rottlerin. By screening the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set ( PKIS) , we identified oxindole-based inhibitors of the Ser/Thr kinase RAF as low micromolar inhibitors of TPST1 and TPST2. Interestingly , unrelated RAF inhibitors , exemplified by the dual BRAF/VEGFR2 inhibitor RAF265 , were also TPST inhibitors
