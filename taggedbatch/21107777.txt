 The aim of this study was to perform the first resting-state functional MRI ( RS-fMRI) analysis in Friedreich 's ataxia<symptom> ( FRDA) patients to assess possible brain functional connectivity ( FC) differences in these patients , and test their correlations with neuropsychological performances. In total , 24 FRDA patients ( M/F: 15/9 , mean age 31.3 ± 15.0) and 24 healthy controls ( HC; M/F: 15/9 , mean age 30.7 ± 15.5) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. All patients underwent a thorough neuropsychological battery , investigating different cognitive domains. RS-fMRI data were analyzed using a seed-based approach , probing the FC of cortical areas potentially referable to specific executive and cognitive functions compromised in FRDA. Compared to HC , FRDA patients showed overall worse neuropsychological scores in several domains , including global cognitive assessment , spatial memory , visuoperception and visuospatial functions , and executive functions. Analysis of RS-fMRI data showed a higher FC in FRDA patients compared to HC between paracingulate gyri and the medial frontal gryrus , between the superior frontal gyrus and bilateral angular gyri , and between the middle temporal gyrus and the cingulate gyrus , with a reduced FC between the medial frontal gryrus and the cerebellum. We found a reduction in FC between frontal areas and the contralateral cerebellar cortex in FRDA , in line with the known alteration in cerebello-cortical pathway in this condition. On the other hand , a higher FC between different cortical areas was shown , possibly reflecting a compensatory phenomenon. These results , in conjunction with clinical findings , may shed new light on the pattern of supratentorial and infratentorial involvement , and on dynamics of brain plasticity in this disease.
