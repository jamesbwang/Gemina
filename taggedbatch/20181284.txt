 Obesity and inactivity have led to an increasing number of individuals with sexual dysfunctions ( 43 % of women; 31 % of men). Small bouts of exercise can drastically improve sexual functioning. Thus , the present study is designed to examine the effects of physical fitness and self-concept on sexual functioning. Fitness assessments and questionnaires were administered to 133 participants between the ages of 18 and 50 years. Physical fitness was assessed through body composition , cardiovascular endurance , muscular strength , and muscular endurance. Self-concept was presented as a total self-concept score and as six individual concepts of self. Sexual function was presented as both an aggregate score and five separate constructs of sexual functioning- fantasy/cognition , arousal , orgasm , behavior/experience , and drive/desire. The results indicated that sexual behavior/experience was predicted by body fat percentage. In men , fantasy was related to total self-concept; sexual behavior/experience was related to likeability. In women , arousal was predicted by cardiovascular endurance. Total self-concept was related to both orgasm and sex drive/desire. Power and muscular strength were significantly related to number of sexual partners in women but not men. The present study adds to the growing body of evidence indicating a positive relationship between physical fitness and sexual health. Individuals with sexual dysfunctions , particularly women , who are not persuaded by the currently publicized benefits of physical activity , may be inclined to exercise to improve sexual functioning.
