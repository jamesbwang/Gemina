 The structural , phononic , and electronic properties of the monolayer structures of AsTe $ _ ( 2) $ are characterized by performing density functional theory calculations. Total energy optimization and phonon calculations reveal that single layers of the 2H-AsTe $ _ ( 2) $ and 1T-AsTe $ _ ( 2) $ phases form dynamically stable crystal structures. Electronic structure analysis also shows that both 2H and 1T phases have nonmagnetic metallic character. It is also predicted that the metallic nature of the ultra-thin both 2H-AsTe $ _ ( 2) $ and 1T-AsTe $ _ ( 2) $ structures remain unchanged even under high biaxial strain values. For further examination of the dimensionality effect in the robust metallicity in 2D AsTe $ _ ( 2) $ phases , electronic characteristics of 1D nanoribbons and 0D quantum dots are also investigated. It is found that independent from the dimension and crystallographic orientations 0D and 1D structures of 2H- and 1T-AsTe $ _ ( 2) $ structures have metallic behavior. It is found that single layers of AsTe $ _ ( 2) $ are quite promising materials for nanodevice applications owing to the outstanding metallic character.
