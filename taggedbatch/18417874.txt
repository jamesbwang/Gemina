 Filariasis<disease> is a major health problem in India. Despite the high prevalence , microfilariae are rarely found in cytology smears. Most of the cases are incidentally found , solely or in association with other pathologies. The study was undertaken to analyze the prevalence and cytology findings of cases of incidentally found microfilariae in cytology smears ( fine-needle aspiration cytology ( FNAC)/ body fluids) from different body parts. This was a retrospective study over 5 years , where the cases of microfilariae in aspirates from swelling of different locations and body fluids were reviewed , and clinic-pathological data were analyzed. Out of 16,738 cases of FNAC and 882 cases of fluid cytology , 22 cases ( 0.124 %) of incidental finding of microfilaria were documented in cytology smears. The cases were diagnosed from lymph nodes ( 5 cases) , skin and soft<disease> tissue ( 4 cases) , scrotal ( 4 cases) , breast ( 3 cases) , thyroid ( 2 cases) , and pleural fluid ( 2 cases). We found eosinophilia in 15 cases ( 68.18 %) of filarial lesions<symptom>. We found two cases of incidental findings of microfilariae in association with malignant lesions<symptom>. Filariasis<disease> should be considered as differential diagnosis of swelling of lymph nodes , skin , soft<disease> tissue , inguinoscrotal region , and other sites as well. Careful screening of cytology smears may help in detection of incidental cases in the association of other pathologies.
