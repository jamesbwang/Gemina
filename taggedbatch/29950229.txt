 To study the clinical efficacy and safety of dexamethasone of different doses combined with bortezomib and thalidomide for treatment of primary multiple myeloma. Ninety-six patients with multiple myeloma from January 2013 to January 2014 were randomly divided into group A ( high-dose dexamethasone + bortezomib + thalidomide , 32 cases) , group B ( low-dose dexamethasone + bortezomib + thalidomide , 32 cases) and group C ( placebo + bortezomib + thalidomide , 32 cases). The clinical efficacy and safety of patients was compared among 3 groups. The overall remission rate ( ORR) in group A and B was significantly higher than that in group C ( P < 0.05) , but the ORR was not significant difference between group A and group B ( P > 0.05). After treatment , the KPS and RNS score in 3 groups were significantly higher and lower than those before treatment , respectively; the KPS score in group A and B was significantly higher than that in group C ( P < 0.05) , the RNS score in group A and B was significantly lower C ( P < 0.05). After treatment , the positive expression rates of CD38 , CD56 and CD138 as well as small residual lesion<symptom> ( SRL) positive rate in 3 grops were significantly lower than those before treatment , but the positive expression rate of CD19 was significantly higher that before treatment; the positive expression rates of CD38 , CD56 and CD138 as well as SRL positive rate in group A and B were significantly lower thant those in group C , while the positive expression rate of CD19 was significantly higher that in group C ( P < 0.05) , but the positive expression rates of CD19 , CD38 , CD56 and CD138 as well as SRL positive rate were not significantly different between group A and B ( P > 0.05). The incidence of fatigue<symptom> , rash<symptom> , peripheral neuropathy , anlmia , granulocyte deficiance and so on in group B and C was significantly lower than that in group A ( P < 0.05) , but the difference in group B and C was not significant ( P > 0.05). The therapeutic efficacy of different doses of dexamethasone combined with bortezomib and thalidomide for patients with multiple myeloma is similar , can obviously enhance remission rate , prolong the survival time , promote life quality , but the incidence of adverse reactions in low dose dexamethason rigemen is significantly reduced , and the safety is better.
