 A media-based collection and further analysis of relative return to play ( RTP) rates and the corresponding quality of play after anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL) rupture in top-level football was the aim of our study. In the 5-year case-control study , male players from the first two leagues of the five top leagues in Europe , who sustained a total ACL rupture during the season 2010/11 and/or 2011/12 , were included. For them and a matched control sample ( ratio 1:2) , data were retrieved from the publicly available and validated media-based platforms ( transfermarkt.de & whoscored.com) until the end of season 2016/17. Injury and return to play-specific data were calculated as rate ratios ( RR) to compare the injured and matched control athletes rates and as a survival analysis ( log-rank test; career duration). Overall , 132 ACL-injuries in 125 players occurred. The RTP rate was 98.2 % , and the RTP to the same level was 59.4 %. Five years post-RTP , 69.9 % of the ACL group were still engaged in football ( RR = 87 %) , 40.9 % at the same level ( RR = 72 %). Survival analysis revealed a systematic group difference in career duration compared to controls ( Cox-Mantel 's Ï‡
