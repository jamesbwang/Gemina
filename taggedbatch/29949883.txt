 Quenching and Partitioning ( Q&P) steels are promising candidates for automotive applications because of their lightweight potential. Their properties depend on carbon enrichment in austenite which , in turn , is strongly influenced by carbide precipitation in martensite during quenching and partitioning treatment. In this paper , by coupling in situ High Energy X-Ray Diffraction ( HEXRD) experiments and Transmission Electron Microscopy ( TEM) , we give some clarification regarding the precipitation process of iron carbides in martensite throughout the Q&P process. For the first time , precipitation kinetics was followed in real time. It was shown that precipitation starts during the reheating sequence for the steel studied. Surprisingly , the precipitated fraction remains stable all along the partitioning step at 400 & deg; C. Furthermore , the analyses enable the conclusion that the iron carbides are most probably eta carbides. The presence of cementite was ruled out , while the presence of several epsilon carbides can not be strictly excluded.
