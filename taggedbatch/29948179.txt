 To localize and quantify ischemic changes induced by proton beam irradiation of central choroidal melanoma and to identify baseline predictors correlated with the extent of ischemic changes. Retrospective chart review of patients with central choroidal melanoma treated by proton beam irradiation and conducted widefield fluorescein angiography ( ≥ 20 months after radiation therapy). Quantification and location of ischemic areas and correlation to baseline predictors. Multiple linear regression model was performed for analyses. Twenty-five eyes from 25 patients were included in final analysis. Mean largest basal tumor area was 56.6 ± 40.0 mm Ischemic changes induced by proton beam irradiation of central choroidal melanoma were localized and quantified. Ischemic changes exceed the tumor area distinctly and are found also outside of the irradiation field in the majority of patients. Size of irradiation area and tumor prominence are positively correlated with extent of ischemic area.
