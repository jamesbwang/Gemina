 The underlying cause of cardiac hypertrophy , fibrosis<disease> , and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> has been investigated in great detail using different mouse models. These studies indicated that cGMP and cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I ( cGKI) may ameliorate these negative phenotypes in the adult heart. Recently , evidence has been published that cardiac mitochondrial BKCa channels are a target for cGKI and that activation of mitoBKCa channels may cause some of the positive effects of conditioning in ischemia/reperfusion injury. It will be pointed out that most studies could not present convincing evidence that it is the cGMP level and the activity cGKI in specific cardiac cells that reduces hypertrophy or heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. However , anti-fibrotic compounds stimulating nitric oxide-sensitive guanylyl cyclase may be an upcoming therapy for abnormal cardiac remodeling.
