 Antimicrobial resistance is a complex epidemiology problem worldwide which calls for a wide and integrated approach such as `` One Health. '' Resistant organisms are present in humans , animals , food , and the environment , and the main impeller of this resistance is the use of antimicrobial agents. The occurrence and propagation of antimicrobial resistance continue incessantly in the world , leaving devastating economic and health consequences behind. In 2015 , the WHO , in collaboration with key partners such as the FAO and the OIE , developed the World Action Plan in Antimicrobial Resistance , under the perspective of `` One Health. '' This Plan was endorsed by several countries and seeks collaboration for the prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance. This article aims at explaining the scope of the `` One Health '' approach within the context of antimicrobial resistance , the reason behind its adoption and what is expected from it. One of the main conclusions is the significant lack of knowledge on the selection and propagation of resistant organisms in the environment , with an emphasis on the threats and risks that this represents to human and animal health. Efforts need to be strengthened in order to better define the risks , design interventions , and measure its impact on antimicrobial resistance.
