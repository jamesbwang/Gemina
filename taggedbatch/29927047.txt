 Climate change has changed the phenologies of species worldwide , but it remains unclear how these phenological changes will affect species interactions and the structure of natural communities. Using a novel approach to analyse long-term data of 66 amphibian species pairs across eight communities , we demonstrate that phenological shifts can significantly alter the interaction potential of coexisting competitors. Importantly , these changes in interaction potential were mediated by non-uniform , species-specific shifts in entire phenological distributions and consequently could not be captured by metrics traditionally used to quantify phenological shifts. Ultimately , these non-uniform shifts in phenological distributions increased the interaction potential for 25 % of species pairs ( and did not reduce interaction potential for any species pair) , altering temporal community structure and potentially increasing interspecific competition. These results demonstrate the potential of phenological shifts to reshape temporal structure of natural communities , emphasising the importance of considering entire phenological distributions of natural populations.
