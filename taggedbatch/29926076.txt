 The liver X receptors ( LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The activated LXRs have a variety of biological functions , for instance they can not only regulate the metabolism of cholesterol , fatty acids and glucose , but also play an important role in immune inflammatory response. Massive studies have shown that LXRs are involved in the occurrence and progress of inflammatory-related diseases , and can inhibit the inflammation<symptom> of some inflammatory-related diseases in the nervous system , the respiratory system , and the cardiovascular system. In this review , we summarized the recent progress regarding LXRs in inflammatory-related diseases , including the structure , function and anti-inflammatory mechanism of LXRs , in order to provide new methods for preventing and treating inflammatory-related diseases.
