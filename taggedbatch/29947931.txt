 Within the field of oncology , `` omics '' strategies-genomics , transcriptomics , proteomics , metabolomics-have many potential applications and may significantly improve our understanding of the underlying processes of cancer development and progression. Omics strategies aim to develop meaningful imaging biomarkers for breast cancer ( BC) by rapid assessment of large datasets with different biological information. In BC the paradigm of omics technologies has always favored the integration of multiple layers of omics data to achieve a complete portrait of BC. Advances in medical imaging technologies , image analysis , and the development of high-throughput methods that can extract and correlate multiple imaging parameters with `` omics '' data have ushered in a new direction in medical research. Radiogenomics is a novel omics strategy that aims to correlate imaging characteristics ( i. e. , the imaging phenotype) with underlying gene expression patterns , gene mutations , and other genome-related characteristics. Radiogenomics not only represents the evolution in the radiology-pathology correlation from the anatomical-histological level to the molecular level , but it is also a pivotal step in the omics paradigm in BC in order to fully characterize BC. Armed with modern analytical software tools , radiogenomics leads to new discoveries of quantitative and qualitative imaging biomarkers that offer hitherto unprecedented insights into the complex tumor biology and facilitate a deeper understanding of cancer development and progression. The field of radiogenomics in breast cancer is rapidly evolving , and results from previous studies are encouraging. It can be expected that radiogenomics will play an important role in the future and has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis , treatment , and prognosis of BC patients. This article aims to give an overview of breast radiogenomics , its current role , future applications , and challenges.
