 In an fMRI investigation of the neural representation of word frequency and animacy , participants read high- and low-frequency words within living and nonliving semantic categories. Both temporal ( left fusiform gyrus) and parietal ( left supramarginal gyrus) activation patterns differentiated between animal and tool words after controlling for frequency. Activation patterns in a smaller ventral temporal region , a subset of the voxels identified in the animacy contrast , differentiated between high- and low-frequency words after controlling for animacy. Activation patterns in the larger temporal region distinguished between high- and low-frequency words just as well as patterns within the smaller region. However , in analyses by animacy category , frequency effects in these temporal regions were significant only for tool , not for animal , words. Thus , lexical word frequency information and semantic animacy category information are conjointly represented in left fusiform gyrus activation patterns for some , but not all , concrete nouns.
