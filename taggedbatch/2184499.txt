 A 33-year-old male underwent an optical keratoplasty elsewhere in the right eye following which he developed endophthalmitis<disease> and subsequently underwent a pars plana vitrectomy and lensectomy. At presentation , he had a deep stromal crystalline infiltration along the graft-host junction. A large therapeutic keratoplasty was performed , and the excised corneal button was evaluated. Histopathology revealed gram-positive round-to-oval budding structures and microbiology identified the organism as Candida<pathogen> glabrata<pathogen>. He was treated with antifungals in the postoperative period. At 4 months after therapeutic keratoplasty , the patient developed recurrent endophthalmitis<disease> , following stoppage of antifungals. The treatment was reinstituted for another year , and the patient did well with a clear graft at 18-month-follow-up period after the recurrence episode. Management of infectious crystalline keratopathy with endophthalmitis<disease> is a challenging situation and requires long-term treatment.
