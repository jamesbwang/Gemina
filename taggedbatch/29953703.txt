 Investigations of solid mixtures of the elemental combinations A/Tl/Pb ( A = Na , K) and K/Tl/Bi indicate the presence of multiple binary and ternary Zintl phases , among them new ones containing Tl and Pb or Bi , respectively. Extractions with en/crypt -222 afford single crystals of several novel binary anions , including ( Tl@Tl
