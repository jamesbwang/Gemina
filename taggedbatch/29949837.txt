 The use of tolerogenic dendritic cells ( TolDCs) to control exacerbated immune responses may be a prophylactic and therapeutic option for application in autoimmune and allergic conditions. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of TolDC administration in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation<symptom> caused by mite extract. Mouse bone marrow-derived TolDCs were induced by incubation with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF) and dexamethasone , and then characterized by flow cytometry and cytokine production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). For the in vivo model of Blomia tropicalis-induced allergy , mice transplanted with antigen-pulsed TolDCs were sensitized intraperitoneally with B. tropicalis<pathogen> mite extract ( BtE) adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide. After challenge by nasal administration of BtE , bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF) , lungs , spleen and serum were collected for analysis. Induction of TolDCs was efficiently achieved as shown by low expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC) II , programmed death-ligand ( PD-L) 2 and pro-inflammatory cytokine production , and up-regulation of interleukin ( IL) -10 , upon LPS stimulation in vitro. Transplantation of 1 or 2 doses of BtE-pulsed TolDCs reduced the number of inflammatory cells in BALF and lungs as well as mucus deposition. Moreover , compared to saline-injected controls , TolDC-treated mice showed lower serum levels of anti-BtE immunoglobulin E ( IgE) antibodies as well as reduced Gata3 and IL-4 gene expression in the lungs and decreased IFN-Î³ levels in the supernatant of splenocyte cultures Transplantation of TolDCs increased the percentage of the regulatory T cells in the spleen and the lungs. Preventive treatment with TolDCs protects against dust mite-induced allergy in a mouse model , reinforcing the use of tolerogenic dendritic cells for the management of allergic conditions.
