 Influenza<pathogen><disease> viruses cause respiratory<disease> infections<disease> every epidemic season regardless of the patient 's age. The aim of this study was to determine the activity of respiratory<disease> viruses in the epidemic season 2016/2017 in Poland , with particular emphasis on influenza<pathogen><disease> viruses among people aged over 14. There were 2982 clinical samples taken from patients from four age groups: 15-25 , 26-44 , 45-64 , and ≥ 65 years tested under the Sentinel and non-Sentinel surveillance programs. The presence of influenza<pathogen><disease> viruses was confirmed in more than 40 % of cases , the predominant type was influenza<pathogen><disease> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> unsubtyped , followed by subtype A/H3N2/. The results for the four age groups indicate that the highest number of confirmed respiratory<disease> viruses was recorded in individuals ≥ 65 years of age , slightly less , in the decreasing order , in the age groups 45-64 years , 15-25 years , and 26-44 years. Influenza<pathogen><disease> type B infections were observed only in sporadic cases. Given the epidemiological data , epidemic season 2016/2017 was characterized by similar dynamics compared to the previous season in Poland and also in most of the European countries. More than 4 million cases and suspected cases of influenza<pathogen><disease> and influenza-like viruses have been reported in Poland , more than 16,000 hospitalizations , and 25 deaths , of which 20 cases occurred among people ≥ 65 years of age in the epidemic season 2016/2017.
