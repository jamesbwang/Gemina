 Aberrant right subclavian artery is the most common congenital aortic arch anomaly. There are a few reports concerning the clinical manifestations and follow-up of this CHD detected by echocardiographic screening. A total of 1737 full-term neonates , with a male-to-female ratio of 900:837 , received echocardiographic screening. Neonates with or without isolated aberrant right subclavian artery were studied during infancy. Among the 1737 cases , a total of 15 ( 0.86 %) female-predominant neonates , with a male-to-female ratio of 6:9 , had isolated aberrant right subclavian artery. They were compared with 20 age- and gender-matched normal neonates. There were no significant differences in maternal age , gestational age , or para gravity between the two groups , except for birth size ( birth length- and weight-for-age percentiles , p = 0.006 and 0.045 , respectively) , which was smaller in the aberrant right subclavian artery group. Although there were no significant differences in developmental history , gastrointestinal , or respiratory<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , neonates with aberrant right subclavian artery had a higher incidence of mild developmental delay and feeding difficulty than normal infants ( 21 versus 0 % , p = 0.061; 36 versus 20 % , p = 0.264 , respectively). The growth rates of body length and weight during infancy were not significantly different between the two groups. Echocardiography can be applied as a first-line investigation in the diagnostic work-up for aberrant right subclavian artery. Neonates with aberrant right subclavian artery had a smaller size at birth , although growth rates were not significantly different from those of normal infants. This study does not support an active surgical policy for asymptomatic infants with isolated aberrant right subclavian artery. A larger study and longer follow-up of affected infants is recommended.
