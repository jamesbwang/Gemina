 Phi29 DNA polymerase ( DNAP) is the replicative enzyme of the Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> bacteriophage Phi29. Its extraordinary processivity and its ability to perform isothermal amplification of DNA are central to many molecular biology applications , including high-sensitivity detection and large-scale production of DNA. We present here Phi29 DNAP as an efficient catalyst for the production of various artificial nucleic acids ( XNAs) carrying backbone modifications such as 1,5-anhydrohexitol nucleic acid ( HNA) , 2 '- deoxy-2 '- fluoro-arabinonucleic acid ( FANA) , and 2 '- fluoro-2 '- deoxyribonucleic acid ( 2 '- fluoro-DNA). A full protocol for the synthesis of HNA polymers by an exonuclease-deficient variant ( D12A) of Phi29 DNAP plus a detailed guide for the design and test of novel XNA synthetase reactions performed by Phi29 DNAP are provided.
