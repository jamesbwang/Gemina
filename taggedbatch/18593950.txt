 As an important component in the innate immune system , natural killer ( NK) cells have been demonstrated to be clinically associated with prostate cancer ( PCa) progression and castration resistance. Therefore , the development of novel agents that may enhance the cytotoxicity of NK cells possesses promising therapeutic applications. In the present study , leinal polypeptide ( LP) solution was supplemented into a co-culture system of NK and PCa cells , as it was previously demonstrated that LP are able to activate NK cells , which kill PCa cells based on an MTT cell viability assay. Mechanistic dissection demonstrated that LP enhanced androgen receptor degradation , which resulted in an upregulation of MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A ( MICA) and MICB. In turn , the induced expression of MICA and MICB was able to further trigger NK cell activation , forming a positive loop between NK cells and PCa cells in the presence of LP solution.
