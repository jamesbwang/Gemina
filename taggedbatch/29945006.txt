 To examine the changes of expression and activity of phosphodiesterase V ( PDEV) in the basilar artery following cerebral vasospasm ( CVS) after subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( SAH) in rabbits model. A rabbit model of CVS after SAH was constructed by twice blood<symptom> injection<symptom> into the cisterna magna<pathogen>. The subjects were divided into the following groups: blank control , tested control and SAH-treated group. Transcranial doppler ( TCD) and selective vertebrobasilar digital subtraction angiography ( DSA) were performed on day 5 to determine the changes of CVS. Changes of PDEV expression and activity were examined. Severity of CVS could be accurately determined by DSA and TCD. Narrowing of the basilar artery was observed at 24 h after second blood<symptom> injection<symptom> into the SAH-treated rabbits , along with delayed imaging and increased blood flow rate. These changes reached peak levels on day 3 post-surgery and were maintained up until day 7 , after which they gradually returned to normal levels on day 11. PDEV expression was significantly increased in the basilar artery of rabbits in the SAH group. The concentration and activity of PDEV began to increase at 24 h post-surgery , peaked at day 3-day 7 , and gradually decreased to normal levels on day 11. Increased basilar artery blood flow , narrowing of the basilar artery , and PDEV expression in the basilar artery could be detected using TCD , DSA and immunohistochemistry , respectively , suggesting that PDEV is associated with the development of CVS following SAH in rabbits.
