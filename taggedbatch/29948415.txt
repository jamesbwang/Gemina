 Birds , with their broad geographic ranges and close association with humans , have historically played an important role as carriers of human<disease> disease<disease> and as reservoirs for drug-resistant bacteria. Here , we examine scientific literature over a 15-year timespan to identify reported avian-bacterial associations and factors that may impact zoonotic disease emergence by classifying traits of bird species and their bacteria. We find that the majority of wild birds studied were migratory , in temperate habitats , and in the order Passeriformes. The highest diversity of bacteria was found on birds in natural habitats. The most frequently reported bacteria were Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , Salmonella<pathogen><disease> enterica<pathogen> , and Campylobacter<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen><symptom>. Of the bacteria species reported , 54 % have shown pathogenicity toward humans. Percentage-wise , more pathogens were found in tropical ( vs. temperate) habitats and natural ( vs. suburban , urban , or agricultural) habitats. Yet , only 22 % were tested for antibiotic resistance , and of those tested , 75 % of bacteria species were resistant to at least one antibiotic. There were no significant patterns of antibiotic resistance in migratory versus non-migratory birds , temperate versus tropical areas , or different habitats. We discuss biases in detection and representation , and suggest a need for increased sampling in non-temperate zones and in a wider range of avian species.
