 To explore the possible biological mechanism of skeletal muscle contusion repair through researching the changes in expression of autophagy-related genes and proteins in SD rats with acute skeletal muscle contusion. Six rats were randomly selected as the control group from 30 male SD rats , acute skeletal muscle contusion model were established in the remaining 24 rats with self-made hitter , then the model rats were randomly divided into 4 groups ( 3 d , 5 d , 7 d , 14 d groups , The results of HE staining showed that compared with the control group , the inflammation<symptom> reached its peak on the 5 The above results indicate that the autophagy is involved in repair of skeletal muscle injury by its autophagyrelated factors , regularly changes after contusion , and the rate of damage repair may be related to the level of autophagy.
