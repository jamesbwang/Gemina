 This paper outlines a novel application of the social ecological model ( SEM) for firearm suicide prevention. It focuses on four levels of intervention ( societal , relationship , community and individual) to reduce access to firearms , a practical contributor to the capacity to attempt suicide , from individuals when they are at an elevated risk for suicide. There is substantive research linking easy access to firearms with an increased risk of firearm suicide , and suicide prevention interventions that address access to lethal means are critical components of a comprehensive suicide prevention strategy. Potential interventions using the SEM framework include: at the policy level-extreme risk laws , voluntary self-prohibition policies and policies that reduce the availability of firearms; at the community level-gun shop projects; at the relationship level-lethal means safety counselling; and at the individual level-safer storage. Taken together with upstream interventions , such as increased access to mental health services and substance use treatment , a multilevel approach for suicide prevention that addresses access to firearms can save lives.
