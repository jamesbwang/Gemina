 Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML) is a rare but fatal disease leading to severe<symptom> neurological impairments. PML is a clinical manifestation , which is usually associated with John Cunningham virus ( JCV) infection. It is also correlated to malignancies that mainly include hematologic malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL). Until now , no specific treatment has been established for JCV-induced PML; therefore , the prognosis of this disease is poor.We present a case of a 67-year-old woman who suffered from CLL with a chief complaint of seizure<symptom>. Her clinical symptoms , results of brain MRI and biopsy were suggestive for the JCV-induced PML. The patient had received treatment using mefloquine at dose of 250 mg/day with no clinical improvement.
