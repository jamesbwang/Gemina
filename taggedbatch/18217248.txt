 Along with the intensive development of methods of livestock breeding , breeders ' expectations are growing concerning feed additives that would guarantee such results as accelerating growth rate , protection of health from pathogenic infections and improvement of other production parameters such as: absorption of feed and quality of meat , milk , eggs. The main reason for their application would be a strive to achieve some beneficial effects comparable to those of antibiotic-based growth stimulators , banned on 01 January 2006. High hopes are being associated with the use of probiotics , prebiotics and synbiotics. Used mainly for maintenance of the equilibrium of the intestinal microbiota of livestock , they turn out to be an effective method in fight against pathogens posing a threat for both animals and consumers. This paper discusses definitions of probiotics , prebiotics and synbiotics. Criteria that have to be met by those kinds of formulas are also presented. The paper offers a list of the most commonly used probiotics and prebiotics and some examples of their combinations in synbiotic formulas used in animal feeding. Examples of available study results on the effect of probiotics , prebiotics and synbiotics on animal health are also summarised.
