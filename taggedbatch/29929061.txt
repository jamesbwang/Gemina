 Anxiety<symptom> is induced by unpredictable threat , and presumably characterized by enhanced vigilance. In contrast , fear is elicited by imminent threat , and leads to phasic responses with selective attention. In order to investigate attention mechanisms and defensive responding during fear and anxiety<symptom> , we employed an adaptation of the NPU-threat test and measured cortical ( steady-state visual evoked potentials , ssVEPs) , physiological ( heart rate , HR) , and subjective responses ( ratings) to predictable ( fear-related) and unpredictable ( anxiety-related) threat in 42 healthy participants. An aversive unconditioned stimulus ( US , loud noise) was 100 % predicted by a cue ( predictable P-cue) in one context ( predictable P-context) , but appeared unpredictably within a different context ( unpredictable U-context , U-cue) , while it was never delivered in a neutral safe context ( N-cue , N- context). In response to predictable threat ( P-cue) , increased ssVEP amplitudes and accelerated HR were found. Both predictable and unpredictable contexts yielded increased ssVEP amplitudes compared to the safe context. Interestingly , in the unpredictable context participants showed longer-lasting visuocortical activation than in the predictable context , supporting the notion of heightened vigilance during anxiety<symptom>. In parallel , HR decelerated to both threat contexts indicating fear bradycardia<symptom> to these threatening contexts as compared to the safe context. These results support the idea of hypervigilance in anxiety-like situations reflected in a long-lasting facilitated processing of sensory information , in contrast to increased selective attention to specific imminent threat during fear. Thus , this study further supports the defense-cascade model with vigilance and orienting in the post-encounter phase of threat ( anxiety<symptom>) , while selective attention and defensive mobilization in the circa-strike phase of threat ( fear).
