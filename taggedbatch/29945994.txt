 Gastric adenoma ( GA) is a premalignant lesion<symptom> that precedes intestinal-type gastric carcinoma ( GC). However , genetic progression mechanisms from GA to GC have not been clarified. We performed whole-exome sequencing-based mutational analyses for 15 synchronous pairs of attached GAs and GCs. There was no significant difference in the number of driver mutations or copy number alterations between GAs and GCs. Well-known mutations of The preferred sequence of mutational events during GA-to-GC progression might be more context-dependent than colon adenoma progression. Our results show that non-clonal synchronous GA/GC is common , and that GA genomes have already acquired distinct genomic alterations , suggesting caution in the diagnosis of synchronous GA and GC , especially in residual or recurrent cases.
