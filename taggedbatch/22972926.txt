 MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) have been shown to be key modulators of post-transcriptional gene silencing in many cellular processes. In previous studies designed to understand the role of miRNAs in thymic development , we globally deleted miRNA exclusively in thymic epithelial cells ( TECs) , which are critical in thymic selection. This resulted in the loss of stromal cells that instruct T cell lineage commitment and affect thymocyte positive selection , required for mature T cell development. Since murine miR-181 is expressed in the thymus and miR-181 deficiency disrupts thymocyte development , we first quantified and thereby demonstrated that miR181a1 and miR181b1 are expressed in purified TECs. By generating mice with TEC targeted loss of miR-181a1 and miR-181b1 expression , we observed that neither TEC cellularity nor thymocyte number nor differentiation was adversely affected. Thus , disrupted thymopoiesis in miR-181 deficient mice was not due to miR-181 loss of expression in TECs. Importantly , in mice with restricted TEC deficiency of miR-181a1 and miR-181b1 , there were similar numbers of mature T cells in the periphery in regards to frequencies , differentiation , and function as compared to controls. Moreover miR-181a1 and miR-181b1 were not required for maintenance of thymus integrity over time , as thymic involution was not accelerated in gene-targeted mice. Taken together our data indicate that miR-181a1 and miR-181b1 are dispensable for TEC differentiation , their control of thymocyte development and mature T cell export to and homeostasis within the periphery.
