 3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone ( MDPV) , one of the most commonly abused synthetic cathinones , has caused several intoxications and deaths despite its short presence on the market. Apart from its effects on the monoamine systems in the brain , recent in vitro investigations have revealed cytotoxicity. In this study , the effects of increasing concentrations ( 10-1000 Î¼M) of 3,4-Catechol-PV , one of major MDPV metabolites , on cell viability , morphology , and apoptosis have been evaluated after acute exposure ( 24-48 h) in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells-undifferentiated and differentiated to a more mature neuronal-like phenotype. Results indicated the following: ( i) Cell viability: concentration-dependent decrease ( 15-55 %) in differentiated SH-SY5Y after 24 h , with no exacerbation after 48 h ( LC
