 The toll of inadequate health care is well-substantiated , but recognition is mounting that `` too much '' is also possible. Overdiagnosis represents one harm of too much medicine , but the concept can be confusing: It is often conflated with related harms ( such as overtreatment , misclassification , false-positive results , and overdetection) and is difficult to measure because it can not be directly observed. Because the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF) issues screening recommendations aimed largely at healthy persons , it has a particular interest in understanding harms related to screening , especially but not limited to overdiagnosis. In support of the USPSTF , the authors summarize the knowledge and provide guidance on defining , estimating , and communicating overdiagnosis in cancer screening. To improve consistency , thinking , and reporting about overdiagnosis , they suggest a specific definition. The authors articulate how variation in estimates of overdiagnosis can arise , identify approaches to estimating overdiagnosis , and describe best practices for communicating the potential for harm due to overdiagnosis.
