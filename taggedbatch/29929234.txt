 Hexabromocyclododecane ( HBCD) is a widely used brominated flame retardant which is mainly produced in China. Many HBCD facilities are located at the coast and the released HBCD may enter into the coastal ecosystem. There is a risk that HBCD can transfer through the food web to the diet of local population. Therefore , the coastal organisms near one of the biggest HBCD facilities in China were investigated. Variation was observed for the bioaccumulation of HBCD between the detrital food chain and the grazing food chain. In the studied species , the mullet was most contaminated which may be caused by its feeding on detritus. At the same time , the transfer of HBCD along the food web was investigated , and HBCD was biomagnified from the prey to the predator in the grazing food chains. Among the three diastereoisomers , α-HBCD was biomagnified with increasing trophic levels in the food web while β- and γ-HBCD were not. To assess the human dietary exposure , the dietary intake of HBCD from seafood was estimated , and the estimated daily intake ( EDI) was 5.22 ng/kg/day for adults , and 16.39 ng/kg/day for children. The EDI for local residents were tens of times higher than that for general population in China , but the risk through dietary intake was very low in terms of existing reference dose.
