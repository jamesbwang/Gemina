 It is not efficient enough using the current approaches for tumor-selective drug delivery based on the EPR effect and ligand-receptor interactions , and they have largely failed to translate into the clinic. Therefore , it is urgent to explore an enhanced strategy for effective delivery of anticancer agents. Clinically , many cancers require large amounts of glutamine for their continued growth and survival , resulting in circulating glutamine extraction by the tumor being much greater than that for any organs , behaving as a `` glutamine trap ''. In the present study , we sought to elucidate whether the glutamine-trap effect could be exploited to deliver therapeutic agents to selectively kill cancer cells. Here , a macromolecular glutamine analogue , glutamine-functionalized branched polyethylenimine ( GPI) , was constructed as the carrier to deliver anti-CD47 siRNA for the blockage of CD47 `` do n't eat me '' signals on cancer cells. The GPI/siRNA glutamine-rich polyplexes exhibited remarkably high levels of cellular uptake by glutamine-dependent lung cancer cells , wild-type A549 cells ( A549
