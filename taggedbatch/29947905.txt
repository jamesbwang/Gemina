 Sensor signal drift is the key issue for the reliability of continuous gas sensors. In this paper , we characterized the sensing signal drift of an amperometric ionic liquid ( IL)- based oxygen sensor to identify the key chemical parameters that contribute to the signal drift. The signal drifts due to the sensing reactions of the analyte oxygen at the electrode/electrolyte interface at a fixed potential and the mass transport of the reactant and product at the electrode/electrolyte interface were systematically studied. Results show that the analyte concentration variation and the platinum electrode surface activity are major factors contributing to sensing signal drift. An amperometric method with a double potential step incorporating a conditioning step was tested and demonstrated to be useful in reducing the sensing signal drift and extending the sensor operation lifetime. Also , a mathematic method was tested to calibrate the baseline drift and sensing signal sensitivity change for continuous sensing. This study provides the understanding of the chemical processes that contribute to the IL electrochemical gas ( IL-EG) sensor signal stability and demonstrates some effective strategies for signal drift calibration that can increase the reliability of the continuous amperometric sensing.
