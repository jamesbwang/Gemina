 To evaluate if ABO blood group and Rh factor have an effect on retinal and choroidal thickness. This study was designed prospectively. Retinal nerve fiber layer , retinal , and choroidal thicknesses were measured with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Retinal and choroidal thickness measurements ( one subfoveal , three temporal , and three nasal) were obtained at 500-μm intervals up to 1500 μm with the caliper system. In this study , 109 male and 151 female , 260 individuals in total were included. There were 125 subjects in group A , 29 in group B , 34 in group AB , and 72 in group O. Rh factor was positive in 194 subjects and negative in 66. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding age ( p = 0.667). The groups did not show any statistical difference in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. There was significant difference found for mean retinal thickness at temporal 1000 μm when four groups were compared ( p = 0.037). No statistically significant difference was detected for the remaining retinal and choroidal sectoral regions. The groups did not statistically significantly differ concerning Rh factor ( p > 0.05). Although we found a significant difference in retinal thickness in the temporal retina between group B with group A and group O , we suggest that both blood group and Rh factor have no effect on retinal and choroidal thickness.
