 Pathologies of the extensor carpi ulnaris ( ECU) tendon are often due to de Quervain 's tenosynovitis of the first dorsal compartment among the wrist tendon pathologies. A common cause for tendinitis and tenosynovitis of the ECU tendon is its dislocation. ECU dislocation is unique among all wrist tendon injuries due to its typical location within a fibro-osseous tunnel bordered by a fibrous sheath , which is termed as the subsheath. The subsheath is the main anatomic structure keeping the ECU tendon within the tunnel. Subsheath tears can lead to a fixed or dynamic pattern of ECU dislocation. This injury is more often seen in tennis players and golfers than in water polo athletes , as there are overall fewer water polo athletes when compared to tennis players and golfers. In this article , we will discuss the mechanisms , clinical presentation , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) findings , differential diagnoses , and management options for chronic subsheath tears.
