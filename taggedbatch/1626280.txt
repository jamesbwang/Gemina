 Dysregulated immune function in rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> ( RA) might lead to the development of myelodysplastic syndrome<disease><symptom> ( MDS). Serum interleukin-6 ( IL-6) concentrations are increased in both RA and MDS patients. A 58-year-old woman presented with severe RA. During a recent 8-month period , the patient experienced swelling in multiple joints , dizziness<symptom> , and severe anemia<symptom>. The symptoms responded poorly to oral corticosteroids and methotrexate ( MTX). Even treatment of the patient 's anemia<symptom> by transfusion of red blood cells was ineffective. Laboratory tests showed high levels of IL-6 ( 214.24 pg/mL). Combining her medical history with clinical and laboratory parameters , especially those obtained by bone<disease> marrow aspiration , a diagnosis of RA with MDS was made. MTX was discontinued and the patient was given tocilizumab intravenously at a dose of 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks and oral corticosteroids ( 15 mg/QD). The patient 's serological , physical , and pathological abnormalities improved significantly. We report a case of RA with MDS successfully treated with tocilizumab. To our knowledge , this is the first case of an RA patient with MDS that was successfully treated with tocilizumab. In addition , our case emphasizes that IL-6 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of RA with MDS. Tocilizumab might be an effective treatment for RA with MDS , especially in those with high levels of IL-6 , elevated C-reactive protein , and severe anemia<symptom>.
