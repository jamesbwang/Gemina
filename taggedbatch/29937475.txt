 The charge elimination method for moving charged objects was investigated using a passive type ionizer with an air assist to effectively eliminate the static charge generated at high speed by the roll-to-roll process. The passive ionizer has a grounded needle placed horizontally with respect to the moving charged roll and an air hole to eject an air flow to transport the ions from the grounded needle. The passive ionizer releases ions from the grounded needle electrode when the electric field at the tip of the grounded needle exceeds the corona inception condition. The experimental set up is composed of a moving charged roll , the passive ionizer and surface voltmeters for evaluating performance. The charge elimination current I
