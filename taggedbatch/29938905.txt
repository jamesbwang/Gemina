 Ostrinia furnacalis ( Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is one of the most destructive agricultural pests in Asia. Traditional pest-management methods include sex pheromone capture , transgenic crops that produce Bacillus<pathogen> thuringiensis<pathogen> toxin , and pesticides. Although these strategies control pest populations effectively , they also causes negative side effects , including dramatically increased pesticide resistance , severe pollution , and hazard for human health. Recently developed genome editing tools provide new prospect for pest management and have been used in several species successfully. However , few examples have been reported in the agricultural pest O. furnacalis since lacking the genomic information. In this report , we identified only one transcript of O. furnacalis Argonaute 1 ( OfAgo1) gene from the genome and cloned the open reading frame ( ORF<pathogen>). OfAgo1 presented the maximum expression at the embryo stage or in the fat body during the larval stages. To understand its function , an OfAgo1 mutant was constructed using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat/RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease ( CRISPR/Cas9). Mutagenesis of OfAgo1 disrupted cuticle pigmentation by down-regulating miRNAs and pigmentation related genes. This is the first report for the cloning and functional analysis of OfAgo1 , revealing a role of OfAgo1 in cuticle pigmentation. The current report also established a CRISPR/Cas9 system in O. furnacalis , providing a new insight for pest management. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
