 Locking plates have led to important changes in bone fracture management , allowing flexible biological fracture fixation based on the principle of an internal fixator. The technique has its indications and limitations. Most of the typical failure patterns arise from basic technical errors. Types of locking plates , material properties and the general principles of locking plate applications are reviewed together with their misapplication.
