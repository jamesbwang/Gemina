 Immune responses induced by currently licensed inactivated influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccines are mainly directed against the hemagglutinin ( HA) glycoprotein , the immunodominant antigen of influenza<pathogen><disease> viruses. The resulting antigenic drift of HA requires frequent updating of the vaccine composition and annual revaccination. On the other hand , the level of antibodies directed against the neuraminidase ( NA) glycoprotein , the second major influenza<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> antigen , vary greatly. To investigate the potential of the more conserved NA protein for the induction of a subtype-specific protection , vesicular stomatitis virus-based replicons expressing a panel of N1 proteins from prototypic seasonal and pandemic H1N1<pathogen> strain and human H5N1<pathogen> and H7N9 isolates were generated. Immunization of mice and ferrets with the replicon carrying the matched N1 protein resulted in robust humoral and cellular immune responses and protected against challenge with the homologous influenza<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> with similar efficacy as the matched HA protein , illustrating the potential of the NA protein as vaccine antigen. The extent of protection after immunization with mismatched N1 proteins correlated with the level of cross-reactive sialidase-inhibiting antibody titers. Passive serum transfer experiments in mice confirmed that these functional antibodies determine subtype-specific cross-protection. Our findings illustrate the potential of NA-specific immunity for achieving broader protection against antigenic drift variants or newly emerging viruses carrying the same NA but a different HA subtype.
