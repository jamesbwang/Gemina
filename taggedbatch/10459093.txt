 Leukosan SkinLink ( LS) , which combines non-woven textile strips and tissue adhesive , offers the advantage of atraumatic treatment while effectively shortening the procedure time. We hypothesized that wound<disease><symptom> closure would be faster with LS than with surgical suture ( SS) and the wound<disease><symptom> infection<disease> and dehiscence would be similar. A prospective , open label , single-center , randomized controlled trial was performed. Between November 2014 and April 2016 , 49 patients with traumatic lacerations who presented to the emergency department were eligible for study inclusion. The mean wound<disease><symptom> closure time was significantly lower in the LS group than in the SS group ( 1.48 ± 0.2 seconds vs 8.8 ± 3.6 minutes , P < .001). After adjusting the wound<disease><symptom> closure time according to the lacerations length , the time remained significantly lower in the LS group than in the SS group ( 1.0 ± 0.8 seconds vs 5.03 ± 2.5 minutes , P < .001). During follow-up for 14 days , no significant differences in dehiscence and wound<disease><symptom> infection<disease> were observed between the 2 groups. Wound closure was approximately 4minutes faster with LS and there were no differences in wound<disease><symptom><disease> infection<disease> and dehiscence rates. Thus , the LS could be used as a timesaving suture technique for acute traumatic lacerations in emergency department ( ED). ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02333877.
