 Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory<pathogen><disease> Syndrome<pathogen><disease><symptom> Virus ( PRRSV) has a narrow host cell tropism , limited to cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. CD163 protein is expressed at high levels on the surface of specific macrophage types and a soluble form is circulating in blood. CD163 has been described as a fusion receptor for PRRSV , with the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain 5 ( SRCR5) region having been shown to be the interaction site for the virus.As reported earlier , we have generated pigs in which Exon 7 of the CD163 gene has been deleted using CRISPR/Cas9 editing in pig zygotes. These pigs express CD163 protein lacking SRCR5 ( ΔSRCR5 CD163) and show no adverse effects when maintained under standard husbandry conditions. The ΔSRCR5 CD163 was not only detected on the surface of macrophage subsets , but the secreted , soluble protein can also detected in the serum of the edited pigs , as shown here by porcine soluble CD163-specific ELISA. Previous results showed that primary macrophage cells from ΔSRCR5 CD163 animals are resistant to PRRSV-1 , subtypes 1 , 2 , and 3 , as well as PRRSV-2 infection
