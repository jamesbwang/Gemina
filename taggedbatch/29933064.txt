 Cellular metabolic networks should be carefully balanced using metabolic engineering to produce the desired products at the industrial scale. As the precursor for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin , 5-hydroxytryptophan ( 5-HTP) is effective in treating a variety of diseases , such as depression<symptom> , fibromyalgia , obesity , and cerebellar ataxia<symptom>. Due to the lack of an efficient synthetic method , commercial production of 5-HTP is only achieved by extracting from the seeds of Griffonia Smplicifolia. This study reports efficient microbial production of 5-HTP via metabolically engineered Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. Firstly , human tryptophan hydroxylase I ( TPH1) gene was functionally expressed. For endogenous supply of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4) , human BH4 biosynthesis and regeneration pathway was reconstituted. Whole-cell bioconversion resulted in high-level production of 5-HTP ( ~ 1.2 g/L) from 2 g/L L-tryptophan in shake flasks. Further metabolic engineering efforts were employed to achieve 5-HTP biosynthesis from simple carbon sources. The whole biosynthetic pathway was divided into three functional modules , L-tryptophan module , the hydroxylation module , and the BH4 module. By reducing the copy number of L-tryptophan module , replacing TPH1 with a more stable mutant form , and promoter regulation of the BH4 module , 5-HTP was produced at a final titer of 1.3 g/L in the shake flask and 5.1 g/L in a fed-batch fermenter with glycerol as the carbon source , both of which were the highest ever reported for microbial production of 5-HTP.
