J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-The current study aimed to describe the duration-specific running intensities of elite hurling players during competition with respect to position using a rolling average method. Global positioning systems ( 10-Hz Viper; STATSport , Viper , Newry , Northern Ireland) were used to collect data from 36 elite hurling players across 2 seasons. Players were categorized according to playing positions ( full-backs , half-backs , midfielders , half-forwards , and full-forwards). A total of 230 full match samples were obtained from 22 competitive games for analysis. The velocity-time curve was analyzed using a rolling average method , in which the maximum relative total distance ( TD; m · min) , high-speed running distance ( HSR; m · min) , and sprint distance ( SD; m · min) intensities were calculated across 10 different rolling time durations ( 1-10 minutes) within each game. There were large to very large ( effect sizes ( ES) = 0.66-4.33) differences between 1 minute rolling averages and all other durations for TD , HSR , and SD. However , pairwise comparisons between 6 and 10 minutes for TD , HSR , and SD were smaller and more variable ( ES = 0.07 , trivial to ES = 0.85 , moderate). Half-backs , midfielders , and half-forwards achieved a higher maximal relative TD and HSR in all duration-specific fields when compared with full-backs and full-forwards. No positional difference was observed in 1- and 2-minute durations for SD. Because the rolling average duration increased the maximum TD , HSR and SD running intensities decreased across all positions. These data provide knowledge of the peak running intensities of elite hurling competition and can be used to design training activities to sufficiently prepare players for these `` worst-case scenarios.
