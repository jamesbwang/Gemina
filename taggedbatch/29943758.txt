 Appendicitis<disease><symptom> is the most frequent surgical disease in childhood , but it is very uncommon in the neonatal period. In this period of life , a delay in diagnosis ( frequently due to the rareness of this pathology and lack of clinical suspicion) and consequently in therapeutic approach , frequently results in appendicular perforation and a subsequently poor evolution of this pathology. We present the case of a neonate with a history of Down 's syndrome<disease><symptom> and Fallot 's tetralogy. Due to her basal cardiopathy , she required surgical intervention to create a systemic-pulmonary fistula<disease> , as a temporary bridge until definitive cardiac surgery could be performed. In the postoperative period of this surgery she presented fever<symptom> , acute abdomen and abdominal radiography compatible with pneumoperitoneum. An emergency laparotomy was performed , which revealed peritonitis<disease> secondary to a cecal gangrenous appendix with perforation in its middle third. Neonatal appendicitis<disease><symptom> is usually associated with diseases such as cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> , necrotizing enterocolitis<disease> , or Hirschsprung 's disease , as in the case of our patient. In neonates with acute abdomen and presence of pneumoperitoneum , appendicitis<disease><symptom> must be part of the differential diagnosis and requires urgent surgical intervention. Despite this , it presents a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Once the definitive diagnosis is made , any basal pathology that justifies its presence should be discarded.
