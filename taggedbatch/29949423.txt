 In 1975 , federal law mandated that children with disabilities be educated in their least restrictive environment , or alongside peers without disabilities in general education classrooms to the maximum extent appropriate. More than 40 years later , I investigated how national trends in educational placement have changed over time for students with intellectual disability. Specifically , I examined the degree placements have trended toward less restrictive environments. I found historical trends of incremental progress toward less restrictive settings , but no evidence of such progress in recent years. Furthermore , most students were educated predominantly in segregated settings every year. I discuss how these findings relate to previous studies , as well as implications for individualized education program teams and advocates for educational inclusion.
