 To assess whether extracellular volume ( ECV) fraction with equilibrium contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography ( MDCT) predicts outcomes for unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients treated with chemotherapy METHODS: Sixty-seven patients ( 42 men , 25 women; mean age , 67.5 years; range , 45-83 years) with histologically confirmed surgically unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma underwent contrast-enhanced MDCT before systemic chemotherapy. Tumour contrast enhancement ( CE) and ECV fraction were calculated using region-of-interest measurement within the pancreatic adenocarcinoma and aorta on unenhanced and equilibrium phase-enhanced CT.. The effect on survival variables including age , sex , tumour location , tumour size , TNM stage , carbohydrate antigen ( CA) 19-9 , carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA) , tumour CE and tumour ECV fraction was determined on univariate and multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression model. Median overall survival was 10.5 months. On univariate analysis , elevated serum CA19-9 ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 1.00; p = 0.006) and CEA ( HR , 1.02; p = 0.011) levels were found to be associated with a negative effect on overall survival. Increasing tumour CE ( HR , 0.98; p < 0.001) and ECV fraction ( HR , 0.97; p = 0.001) were associated with a positive effect. Multivariate analysis revealed that only tumour ECV fraction was an independent predictor of overall survival ( HR , 0.97; p = 0.012). ECV fraction with equilibrium contrast-enhanced MDCT could be a useful imaging biomarker for predicting patient survival after chemotherapy for unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. • Tumour aggressiveness and response to therapy are influenced by the extravascular extracellular space. • Extracellular volume ( ECV) fraction can be quantified with equilibrium contrast-enhanced CT. • Patients with higher tumour ECV fraction had better prognosis after chemotherapy.
