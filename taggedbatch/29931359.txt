 Traumatic nasal deformities have a wide spectrum of presentations , which further complicates their management and preoperative planning. Although many methods and algorithms have been proposed for management of specific posttraumatic nasal deformities such as twisted , deviated , saddle or short nose , these algorithms usually focus on a specific deformity in isolation from the remainder of the nose. The aim of this study is to present an algorithm for traumatic nasal deformities and to evaluate the functional and aesthetic outcomes of this new algorithm by a preoperative and postoperative quality-of-life questionnaire. Patients with traumatic nasal deformity were operated on according to our surgical algorithm. Preoperative and postoperative Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation ( ROE) scores , which is a rhinoplasty outcome survey , were evaluated. A total of 120 patients were included the study. The mean preoperative ROE score was 3.3 ± 1.9 and mean postoperative ROE score was 20.4 ± 3.2. There was a statistically significant difference between preoperative and postoperative ROE scores ( p < 0.001). There was a negative , mild to moderate , statistically significant correlation between preoperative scores and benefit ( difference between postoperative and preoperative scores) ( r = -0.465 , p < 0.001) , which means patients with lower scores had more improvement from the surgery. During the follow-up period , relapse of deviation , hypertrophic inferior turbinate and intranasal synechia were found in 9 % ( n = 11) , 6.6 % ( n = 8) , and 3.3 % ( n = 4) of patients , respectively. In this study , a comprehensive surgical algorithm applicable to all traumatic nasal deformities is suggested and the results of 120 patients with traumatic nasal deformities are presented.
