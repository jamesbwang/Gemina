 Previous evidence regarding the associations between serum calcium concentrations , dietary calcium intake , and type 2 diabetes ( T2D) is limited. We investigated the longitudinal associations of serum calcium levels and dietary calcium intake with T2D development. This study used data from the Ansung-Ansan cohort , a community-based , prospective cohort that was followed up for 10 years. Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used to evaluate the associations of serum calcium levels ( mean , 9.41 mg/dL) and dietary calcium intake ( median , 389.59 mg/day) with T2D incidence. Association between dietary calcium intake and serum calcium levels was assessed using linear regression models. Albumin-adjusted serum calcium levels were not associated with T2D risk ( hazard ratio ( HR) = 1.07 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.96 , 1.19 , Serum calcium levels were not associated with T2D risk , while higher dietary calcium intake was associated with a decreased risk of T2D development. These results have public health implications for predicting and preventing T2D development , as well as providing guidelines for diet and calcium supplementation.
