 With extremely high specific capacity , silicon has attracted enormous interest as a promising anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. However , silicon suffers from a large volume variation during charge/discharge cycles , which leads to the pulverization of the silicon and subsequent separation from the conductive additives , eventually resulting in rapid capacity fading and poor cycle life. Here , it is shown that the utilization of a self-healable supramolecular polymer , which is facilely synthesized by copolymerization of tert-butyl acrylate and an ureido-pyrimidinone monomer followed by hydrolysis , can greatly reduce the side effects caused by the volume variation of silicon particles. The obtained polymer is demonstrated to have an excellent self-healing ability due to its quadruple-hydrogen-bonding dynamic interaction. An electrode using this self-healing supramolecular polymer as binder exhibits an initial discharge capacity as high as 4194 mAh g
