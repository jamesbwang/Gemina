 The objective of this study was to evaluate effectiveness , retention , and tolerability of brivaracetam ( BRV) in genetic generalized epilepsies ( GGE) in clinical practice. A multicenter , retrospective cohort study recruiting all patients that started BRV in 2016 and 2017. A total of 61 patients ( mean age = 29.8 , range = 9-90 years , 41 female ( 67 %)) were treated with BRV. They were difficult to control , with 2.4 failed antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs) in the past , taking 1.9 AEDs on average at baseline. The length of exposure to BRV ranged from 7 days to 24 months , with a mean retention time of 7.9 months , resulting in a total exposure time to BRV of 483 months. The retention rate was 82 % at 3 months and 69 % at 6 months. Efficacy at 3 months was 36 % ( 50 % responder rate) , with 25 % seizure-free for 3 months. Patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy showed a responder rate of 60 % , with 40 % being free of any seizures<symptom>. Long-term 50 % responder rate was present in 17 patients ( 28 %; 11 seizure-free ( 18 %)) for > 6 months and in 14 patients ( 23 %; 10 seizure-free ( 16 %)) for > 12 months. Treatment-emergent adverse events were observed in 26 % of the patients , with the most common being somnolence , ataxia<symptom> , and psychobehavioral adverse events. Use of intravenous BRV with bolus injection of 200-300 mg in two females with absence status epilepticus was well tolerated , but did not result in cessation of status epilepticus. Use of BRV in GGE is well tolerated , and 50 % responder rates are similar to those observed in the regulatory trials for focal epilepsies. An immediate switch from levetiracetam ( LEV) to BRV at a ratio of 15:1 is feasible. The occurrence of psychobehavioral adverse events seems less prominent than under LEV , and a switch to BRV can be considered in patients with LEV-induced adverse events.
