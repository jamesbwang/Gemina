 With the advent of treatment as prevention of HIV<pathogen> infection ( TasP) , we assessed trends in sexual behaviours between 2000 and 2017 among HIV-infected MSM enrolled in the French ANRS PRIMO cohort. At each cohort visit , a clinical questionnaire including laboratory values was completed and a self-administered questionnaire was used to collect sexual behaviours , that is , the number , type ( steady/casual) and HIV<pathogen> status ( positive or negative/unknown) of partners , and condom use. The possible influence of viral load ( undetectable/detectable) measured at the preceding visit on the evolution over time of sexual behaviour was assessed with logistic regression models fitted by generalized estimating equations ( GEE) , taking into account longitudinal data. We analyzed data from 10657 follow-up visits by 1364 MSM. Overall , whatever the considered behavioural variable: at least one sexual partner , steady and/or casual , condomless sex with steady , casual partners , serodiscordant or not , we observed a calendar increase with a particularly more marked rise from 2010 ( P < 0.0001). Inconsistent condom use did not differ according to the viral load status ( detectable vs. undetectable). Trends in inconsistent condom use increased across different generations of MSM , as defined by the year they were diagnosed with HIV<pathogen> infection. ` Having a sexual partner ' and condomless sex , both increased in frequency between 2000 and 2017. Viral load status did not influence condom use as could have been expected from the 2008 Swiss Statement.
