 Pregnancy loss ( PL) can be a very difficult experience. However , the evidence regarding the prevalence and correlates of psychopathology following PL is inconsistent at best. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD) and Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD) following PL , and their differential predictors. Participants were 97 women , ages 23-47 , who have experienced PL starting from the 2nd trimester. They were recruited at the Hadassah Ein-Kerem Medical Center in Jerusalem , Israel. The mean pregnancy week of loss was 27.92. Participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing PTSD ( PCL-5) , MDD ( BDI-II) , sociodemographic variables and factors related to the loss. We have found high rates of probable PTSD ( 33.3 %) and MDD ( 29.4 %) among our sample , as well as high PTSD-MDD comorbidity. A more advanced gestational week of loss and shorter time since PL were positively associated with both PTSD and MDD. Younger age and lower religiosity were associated with more severe PTSD , but not MDD. PL is a potentially-traumatic experience , entailing a heavy burden of PTSD and MDD. Mental health professionals are encouraged to closely monitor women following PL , particularly young mothers , who have experienced PL more recently , and at the advanced stages of pregnancy.
