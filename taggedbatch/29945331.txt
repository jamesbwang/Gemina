 DNA demethylase is a crucial enzyme in the epigenetic modification and regulation mechanisms of gene transcription. Based on previous assertions that the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is associated with epigenetics , we aimed to explore whether DNA demethylase activity might be related to schizophrenia in northeast China. We recruited 25 patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 29 normal controls from a northeast Chinese Han population. The diagnostic criteria of schizophrenia were determined according to diseases and related health problems , the tenth revision ( ICD-10) , and criteria of mental disorders , the third revised edition ( CCMD3). DNA demethylase activity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) was measured using a DNA demethylase activity colorimetric assay ultra kit. Using Student 's t-test , activation of DNA demethylase and its activity were higher in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy individuals ( p < 0.001). Furthermore , the level of DNA demethylase activity in male and female subjects with schizophrenia significantly increased ( all p < 0.05). Our data showed that DNA demethylase might play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia , and individuals with higher DNA demethylase activity were susceptible to schizophrenia in a northeast Chinese Han population. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first time directly measured human blood samples to examine the association between first-episode schizophrenia patients and DNA demethylase activity , which will provide new insight to explore the effect on the mechanism of schizophrenia.
