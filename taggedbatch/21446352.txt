 From a health and performance-related perspective , it is crucial to evaluate subjective symptoms and objective signs of acute training-induced immunological responses in young athletes. The limited number of available studies focused on immunological adaptations following aerobic training. Hardly any studies have been conducted on resistance-training induced stress responses. Therefore , the aim of this observational study was to investigate subjective symptoms and objective signs of immunological stress responses following resistance training in young athletes. Fourteen ( 7 females and 7 males) track and field athletes with a mean age of 16.4 years and without any symptoms of upper or lower respiratory<disease><symptom> tract<symptom><disease> infections<disease> participated in this study. Over a period of 7 days , subjective symptoms using the Acute Recovery and Stress Scale ( ARSS) and objective signs of immunological responses using capillary blood markers were taken each morning and after the last training session. Differences between morning and evening sessions and associations between subjective and objective parameters were analyzed using generalized estimating equations ( GEE). In
