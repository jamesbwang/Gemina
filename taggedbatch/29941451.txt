 The precise location of chromatin domains within the cell nucleus has seen growing recognition in the past decade as an additional mechanism of controlling gene expression in both plants and animals ( Dekker et al. , 2017). Consequently , international efforts are devoted to understanding the organising principle of this organelle in plants , and notably the nature and the role of functional compartments on gene expression ( Graumann et al. , 2013; Sotelo-Silveira et al. , 2018). The European cooperation ` Impact of Nuclear Domains on Gene Expression and Plant Traits ' ( INDEPTH) brings together molecular cell biologists , plant physiologists , bioinformaticians , image analysts and computer scientists. They aim to address the question of how nuclear architecture , chromatin organisation and gene expression are connected in plants , particularly in relation to traits of interest such as biomass , reproduction and resistance to pathogens ( https://www.brookes.ac.uk/indepth/). The kick-off meeting of the INDEPTH consortium took place in Clermont-Ferrand , France , on 12-14th March 2018 , where more than 80 researchers set the agenda for the coming four years of research and collaboration.
