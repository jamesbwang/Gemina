 Cranial<symptom> nerve foramina are integral exits from the confines of the skull. Despite their significance in cranial<symptom> nerve pathologies , there has been no comprehensive anatomical review of these structures. Owing to the extensive nature of this topic we have divided our review into two parts; Part II , presented here , focuses on the foramina of the posterior cranial fossa and discusses each foramen 's shape , orientation , size , surrounding structures , and structures that pass through it. Furthermore , by comparing foramen sizes against the cross-sectional areas of their contents , we determine the amount of free space available within each. We also review lesions<symptom> that can obstruct each foramen and discuss the clinical consequences.
