 Although implantation of a left ventricular assist device ( LVAD) generally improves tricuspid regurgitation ( TR) in short-term follow-up , the clinical significance of residual TR in patients with mid- to long-term LVAD support is unknown. This study aimed to identify the prevalence , predictors , and prognostic value of residual TR in LVAD patients in association with tricuspid valve ( TV) deformation. The study cohort consisted of 127 patients who underwent LVAD implantation without TV procedure and were supported with LVAD at least 1 year. All patients underwent echocardiographic examination preoperatively and 1 year after LVAD implantation. TR was quantitatively assessed by ratio of TR color jet area/right atrial area , and significant residual TR was defined as ≥ 20 % of % TR at follow-up echocardiographic examination. Detailed echocardiographic measurements were also performed , including TV annulus diameter , TV leaflet displacement , and left ventricular and right ventricular systolic function. LVAD implantation significantly improved ratio of TR color jet area/right atrial area as well as left ventricular and right ventricular systolic function and tethering distance ( all Significant residual TR was observed in ≈ 25 % patients supported with LVAD over 1 year and was associated with unfavorable outcome.
