 Anthropogenic activities , predation , and diseases have contributed to a decrease in the sea turtle population in recent years. Ulcerative stomatitis is a condition that occurs in both wild and captive populations. The etiology of this condition is associated with bacteria such as E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , Citrobacter<pathogen> diversus , Klebsiella<pathogen> spp. , Pseudomonas<pathogen> spp. , Flavobacter calcoaceticus<pathogen> , Staphylococcus<pathogen> spp. , and Flavobacterium spp.. Some of these microorganisms are part of the oral microbiota of turtles , but alterations in the immune response can disturb the homeostatic relationship and cause an increase in the population of microorganisms , which in turn can cause disease. This work presents results on the isolation and identification of bacteria present in ulcerative stomatitis lesions<symptom> in captive C. mydas turtles. Oral mucosa samples from 20 clinically healthy turtles and ten animals with ulcerative stomatitis lesions<symptom> were studied. The samples were cultivated in enriched and differential media , and the identification was made using an automated method. The results showed a great diversity of bacteria in animals with ulcerative stomatitis with a higher prevalence of S. lentus and C.<pathogen> braakii<pathogen> was higher ( 60 and 50 % , respectively) than in healthy animals. E.<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> was identified in 40 % of diseased animals and 55 % healthy animals. Turtles in this study had a diverse oral microbiota , and S. lentus and C.<pathogen> braakii<pathogen> may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of ulcerative stomatitis.
