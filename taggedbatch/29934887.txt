 The OECD QSAR Toolbox is a computer software designed to make pragmatic qualitative and quantitative structure-activity relationship methods-based predictions of toxicity , including read-across , available to the user in a comprehensible and transparent manner. The Toolbox , provide information on chemicals in structure-searchable , standardized files that are associated with chemical and toxicity data to ensure that proper structural analogs can be identified. This chapter describes the advantages of the Toolbox , the aims , approach , and workflow of it , as well as reviews its history. Additionally , key functional elements of it use are explained and features new to Version 4.1 are reported. Lastly , the further development of the Toolbox , likely needed to transform it into a more comprehensive Chemical Management System , is considered.
