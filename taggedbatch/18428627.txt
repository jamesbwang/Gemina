 Dopamine plays a key role in the cellular and behavioral responses to drugs of abuse , but the implication of metabotropic regulatory input to dopaminergic neurons on acute drug effects and subsequent drug-related behavior remains unclear. Here , we used chemogenetics ( Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs ( DREADDs)) to modulate dopamine signaling and activity before cocaine administration in mice. We show that chemogenetic inhibition of dopaminergic ventral tegmental area ( VTA) neurons differentially affects locomotor and reward-related behavioral responses to cocaine. Stimulation of Gi-coupled DREADD ( hM4Di) expressed in dopaminergic VTA neurons persistently reduced the locomotor response to repeated cocaine injections. An attenuated locomotor response was seen even when a dual-viral vector approach was used to restrict hM4Di expression to dopaminergic VTA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens. Surprisingly , despite the attenuated locomotor response , hM4Di-mediated inhibition of dopaminergic VTA neurons did not prevent cocaine sensitization , and the inhibitory effect of hM4Di-mediated inhibition was eliminated after withdrawal. In the conditioned place-preference paradigm , hM4Di-mediated inhibition did not affect cocaine-induced place preference; however , the extinction period was extended. Also , hM4Di-mediated inhibition had no effect on preference for a sugar-based reward over water but impaired motivation to work for the same reward in a touchscreen-based motivational assay. In addition , to support that VTA dopaminergic neurons operate as regulators of reward motivation toward both sugar and cocaine , our data suggest that repeated cocaine exposure leads to adaptations in the VTA that surmount the ability of Gi-signaling to suppress and regulate VTA dopaminergic neuronal activity.
