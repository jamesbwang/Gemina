 The properties of nanocrystals are highly dependent on their morphology , composition , and structure. Tailored synthesis over these parameters is successfully applied for the production of nanocrystals with desired properties for specific applications. However , in order to obtain full control over the properties , the behavior of nanocrystals under external stimuli and application conditions needs to be understood. Herein , using Ag-NiP
