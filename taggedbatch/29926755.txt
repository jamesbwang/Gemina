 After ~ 3 decades of research , two Mn ( III) porphyrins ( MnPs) , MnTE-2-PyP5 + ( BMX-010 , AEOL10113) and MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5 + ( BMX-001) have progressed to 5 clinical trials. In parallel , another similarly potent metal-based superoxide dismutase ( SOD) mimic- Mn ( II) pentaaza macrocycle , GC4419- has been tested in clinical trial on application , identical to that one of MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5 +- radioprotection of normal tissue in Head and Neck cancer patients. This clearly indicates that Mn complexes , that target cellular redox environment , have reached sufficient maturity for clinical applications. Recent advances. While originally developed as SOD mimics , MnPs undergo intricate interactions with numerous redox sensitive pathways , such as those involving NF-кB and Nrf2 , thereby impacting cellular transcriptional activity. Increasing amount of data supports the notion that MnP/H2O2/GSH-driven catalysis of S-glutathionylation of protein cysteine , associated with modification of protein function , is a major action of MnPs on molecular level. Differential effects of MnPs on normal vs tumor cells/tissues , which support their translation into clinic , arise from differences in their accumulation and redox environment of such tissues. This in turn results in different yields of MnP-driven modifications of proteins. Thus far , direct evidence for such modification of NF-кB , MAPK , phosphatases , Nrf2 and endogenous antioxidative defenses was provided in tumor , while indirect evidence shows the modification of NF-кB and Nrf2 translational activities by MnPs in normal tissue. Studies that simultaneously explore differential effects in same animal are lacking , while they are essential for understanding of extremely intricate interactions of metal-based drugs with complex cellular networks of normal and cancer cells/tissues.
