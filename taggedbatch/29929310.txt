 In this study , the impact of sulfamethazine ( SMZ) , a typical Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products ( PPCPs) existed in waste activated sludge ( WAS) , on the production of short-chain fatty acids ( SCFA) during sludge anaerobic fermentation was investigated for the first time. Experimental results showed that the production of SCFA was positively affected by SMZ , which increased from 571 mg COD/L in the blank to 989 mg COD/L in the 24 mg/kg VSS SMZ reactor , causing 1.73-fold of increase. Mechanism exploration revealed that SMZ enhanced the disruption of both extracellular polymeric substances ( EPS) and cell envelop , thereby benefiting the solubilization of sludge. It was also found that SMZ benefited the acidogenesis and acetogenesis processes but inhibited methonogenesis process , which was another reason for the enhanced SCFA production. Microbial analysis revealed that the abundance of anaerobic functional microorganisms in the SMZ reactor was more advantageous to acetic acid production.
