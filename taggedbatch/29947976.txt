 Development of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> , so-called Richter transformation ( RT) , occurs in 2-5 % of patients and is associated with poor outcome. The clinical features of RT are fairly non-specific and unable to discriminate transformation from other mimics. In case of clinically suspected RT , a CT/MRT is recommended , and FDG-PET/CT may help to select the site of biopsy. Radiological features suggestive of RT have been defined , but there are only limited data about their predictive value , and histological confirmation is still considered the gold standard for RT diagnosis. We retrospectively analyzed 34 patients with clinically suspected RT and available radiological and histological data. A histopathological diagnosis of RT with concordant clinical and radiological findings was obtained in 13 patients. In 18 patients , CT did not show features of transformation , concordant with lack of RT in the biopsy. Of interest , a distinct lymphoma other than DLBCL was identified in two of these cases. A false-positive radiological diagnosis of RT was rendered in two patients , including a case of Herpes<disease> simplex<pathogen><disease> virus lymphadenitis<disease><symptom>. In conclusion , our findings confirm the central role of tissue biopsy in the diagnostic work up in case of clinically suspected RT..
