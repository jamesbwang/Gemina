 Peripheral doses out of field could have short and long terms biological effects on patients treated with electron beams. In this study , peripheral dose outside the applicator was measured using the 6 , 10 and 18 MeV beams of an Elekta synergy linac. For these beams dose profiles were measured using EBT3 film at various depths within a solid water phantom. Measurements were performed using 6 × 6 , 10 × 10 , 14 × 14 and 20 × 20 cm
