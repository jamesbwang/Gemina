 To investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine ( Dex) on injury of A549 cells induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation ( H/R) and the influence of C/EBP homologous protein ( CHOP) expression. Logarithmic growth phase A549 cells ( it originated from alveolar type â…¡ epithelial cell line) were randomly divided into 4 groups ( Compared with N group , the number of adherent cells in H group decreased significantly , and cell morphology changed. The absorbance value in H group decreased obviously ( Dex has notable effects against H/R injury , which may be related to effective inhibition of apoptosis mediated by the CHOP 's signal path.
