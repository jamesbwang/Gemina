 Coiled-coil peptides have proven useful in a range of materials applications ranging from the formation of well-defined fibrils to responsive hydrogels. The ability to design from first principles their oligomerization and subsequent higher order assembly offers their expanded use in producing new materials. Toward these ends , homo-tetrameric , antiparallel , coiled-coil , peptide bundles have been designed computationally , synthesized via solid-phase methods , and their solution behavior characterized. Two different bundle-forming peptides were designed and examined. Within the targeted coiled coil structure , both bundles contained the same hydrophobic core residues. However , different exterior residues on the two different designs yielded sequences with different distributions of charged residues and two different expected isoelectric points of pI 4.4 and pI 10.5. Both coiled-coil bundles were extremely stable with respect to temperature ( Tm > 80 C) and remained soluble in solution even at high ( millimolar) peptide concentrations. The coiled-coil tetramer was confirmed to be the dominant species in solution by analytical sedimentation studies and by small-angle neutron scattering , where the scattering form factor is well represented by a cylinder model with the dimensions of the targeted coiled coil. At high concentrations ( 5-15 mM) , evidence of interbundle structure was observed via neutron scattering. At these concentrations , the synthetic bundles form soluble aggregates , and interbundle distances can be determined via a structure factor fit to scattering data. The data support the successful design of robust coiled-coil bundles. Despite their different sequences , each sequence forms loosely associated but soluble aggregates of the bundles , suggesting similar dissociated states for each. The behavior of the dispersed bundles is similar to that observed for natural proteins.
