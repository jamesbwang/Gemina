 The current study evaluated the continuity between the diagnostic operationalizations of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder ( OCPD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition , both as traditionally operationalized and from the perspective of the alternative model of personality disorders. Using both self-report and informant measures , the study had the following four aims: ( a) to examine the extent to which self-report and informant data correspond , ( b) to investigate whether both self-report and informant measures of the alternative model of OCPD can predict traditional OCPD , ( c) to determine if any traits additional to those proposed in the alternative model of OCPD can predict traditional OCPD , and ( d) to investigate whether a measure of OCPD-specific impairment is better at predicting traditional OCPD than are measures of general impairment in personality functioning. A mental health sample of 214 participants was recruited and administered measures of both the traditional and alternative models of OCPD. Self-report data moderately corresponded with informant data , which is consistent with the literature. Results further confirmed rigid perfectionism as the core trait of OCPD. Perseveration and workaholism were also associated with OCPD. Hostility was identified as a trait deserving further research. A measure of OCPD-specific impairment demonstrated its ability to incrementally predict OCPD over general measures of impairment. ( PsycINFO Database Record
