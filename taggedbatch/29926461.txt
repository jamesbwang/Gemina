 During the past decade , DNA origami has become a popular method to build custom two- ( 2D) and three-dimensional ( 3D) DNA nanostructures. These programmable structures could further serve as templates for accurate nanoscale patterning , and therefore they could find uses in various biotechnological applications. However , to transfer the spatial information of DNA origami to metal nanostructures has been limited to either direct nanoparticle-based patterning or chemical growth of metallic seed particles that are attached to the DNA objects. Here , we present an alternative way by combining DNA origami with conventional lithography techniques. With this DNA-assisted lithography ( DALI) method , we can create plasmonic , entirely metallic nanostructures in a highly accurate and parallel manner on different substrates. We demonstrate our technique by patterning a transparent substrate with discrete bowtie-shaped nanoparticles , i.e. , `` nanoantennas '' or `` optical antennas , '' with a feature size of approximately 10 nm. Owing to the versatility of DNA origami , this method can be effortlessly generalized to other shapes and sizes.
