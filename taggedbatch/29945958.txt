 The established role of hypoxia-induced signaling in prostate cancer growth , metastasis , and response to treatment suggests that a method to image hypoxia in tumors could aid treatment decisions. Here we present consumption and supply-based hypoxia ( CSH) imaging , an approach that integrates images related to oxygen consumption and supply into a single image. This integration algorithm was developed in prostate cancer patients receiving hypoxia marker pimonidazole prior to prostatectomy. We exploited the intravoxel incoherent motion ( IVIM) signal in diagnostic diffusion-weighted ( DW) magnetic resonance ( MR) images to generate separate images of the apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) and fractional blood volume ( fBV). ADC and fBV correlated with cell density ( CD) and blood vessel density ( BVD) in histology and whole-mount sections from 35 patients , thus linking ADC to oxygen consumption and fBV to oxygen supply. Pixel-wise plots of ADC versus fBV were utilized to predict the hypoxia status of each pixel in a tumor and visualize the predicted value in a single image. The hypoxic fraction ( HFDWI) of CSH images correlated strongly ( R2 = 0.66; n = 41) with pimonidazole immunoscore ( HSPimo); this relationship was validated in a second pimonidazole cohort ( R2 = 0.54; n = 54). We observed good agreement between CSH images and pimonidazole staining in whole-mount sections. HFDWI correlated with tumor stage and lymph node status , consistent with findings for HSPimo. Moreover , CSH imaging could be applied on histological CD and BVD images , demonstrating transferability to a histopathology assay. Thus , CSH represents a robust approach for hypoxia imaging in prostate cancer that could easily be translated into clinical practice.
