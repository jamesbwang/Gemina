 To investigate buprenorphine exposures among children and adolescents ≤ 19 years old in the United States. Data were analyzed from calls to US poison control centers for 2007-2016 from the National Poison Data System. From 2007 to 2016 , there were 11275 children and adolescents ≤ 19 years old exposed to buprenorphine reported to US poison control centers. Most exposures were among children < 6 years old ( 86.1 %) , unintentional ( 89.2 %) , and to a single substance ( 97.3 %). For single-substance exposures , children < 6 years old had greater odds of hospital admission and of serious medical outcome than adolescents 13 to 19 years old. Adolescents accounted for 11.1 % of exposures; 77.1 % were intentional ( including 12.0 % suspected suicide) , and 27.7 % involved multiple substances. Among adolescents , the odds of hospital admission and a serious medical outcome were higher for multiple-substance exposures than single-substance exposures. Buprenorphine is important for the treatment of opioid use disorder , but pediatric exposure can result in serious adverse outcomes. Manufacturers should use unit-dose packaging for all buprenorphine products to help prevent unintentional exposure among young children. Health providers should inform caregivers of young children about the dangers of buprenorphine exposure and provide instructions on proper medication storage and disposal. Adolescents should receive information regarding the risks of substance abuse and misuse. Suspected suicide accounted for 12 % of adolescent exposures , highlighting the need for access to mental health services for this age group.
