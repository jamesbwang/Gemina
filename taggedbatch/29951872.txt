 An increasing body of data has shown that erythropoietin ( EPO) plays multiple roles in inflammation<symptom> control and immunoregulation. However , less attention has been given to its effects on lupus nephritis ( LN). In this study , we investigated the therapeutic effects of EPO on LN in MRL/lpr mice , a well-studied animal model for lupus. MRL/lpr mice were randomly divided into an EPO and control group. Mice in the EPO group were treated with EPO; saline was given to the control group. Both groups were treated for 10 weeks. We analyzed the differences of general disease condition , histopathologic changes , Th lymphocytes subsets , and the expression of inflammatory factors of mice between the groups. Compared to the control group , mice in the EPO group showed less spleen hyperplasia<disease> , less urinary protein , and lower serum anti-dsDNA antibody; they also had lower renal histopathologic scores and less deposition of IgG/C3 within glomeruli. Moreover , Th1 and Th17 levels were decreased , while Th2 and Treg levels were increased in the spleen , and the expression of inflammatory cytokines decreased in both the spleen and kidneys. EPO increased Th2 and Treg lymphocytes , decreased Th1 , Th17 lymphocytes in the spleen , and inhibited the inflammatory reactions in both the spleen and kidneys , thus ameliorating LN of MRL/lpr mice.
