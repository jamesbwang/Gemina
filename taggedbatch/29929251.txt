 Metal sulfides serve as the sinks of toxic heavy metals in anoxic sediments. Once exposed to fluctuations in environmental conditions , dissolution of metal sulfides can occur and release toxic heavy metal ions into water column. In this study , we investigated the effects of dissolved oxygen ( DO) , pH , salinity and humic acid ( HA) on the dissolution of CuS , PbS and ZnS using batch experiments with continuous aeration to simulate the re-suspension of these metal sulfides during a storm event. Experimental results indicated that oxidative dissolution of CuS , PbS and ZnS occurred in the presence of DO. The rate was the fastest for PbS , followed by CuS and ZnS. Soluble metal concentrations also increased with decreasing pH under oxic conditions. Compared to metal sulfides dissolution rates in freshwater without HA , the presence of saline conditions and HA generally accelerated the dissolution of CuS but inhibited the dissolution of PbS and ZnS. A higher saline or HA concentration , however , did not always lead to a stronger enhanced or inhibited dissolution rate , which could be a collective effect resulting from ligand-enhanced dissolution , complexation , and decreased oxygen and proton attacks due to HA adsorption on the metal sulfide surfaces.
