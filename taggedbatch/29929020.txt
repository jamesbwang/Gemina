 Plants produce a large array of specialized metabolites to protect themselves. Among these allelochemicals , alkaloids display highly diverse and complex structures that are directly related to their biological activities. Plant alkaloid profiling traditionally requires extensive and time-consuming sample preparation and analysis. Herein , we developed a rapid and efficient approach for the comprehensive profiling of alkaloids in plants using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry ( UHPLC-HRMS)- based metabolomics. Using automated compound extraction and elemental composition assignment , our method achieved > 83 % correct alkaloid identification and even > 90 % for medium to high intensity peaks. This represented a significant improvement in identification rate compared to generic methods used for EC determination with no a priori , such as in untargeted metabolomics studies. The developed approach was then applied to identify specific alkaloids of Aconitum lycoctonum L. and A. napellus L. ( Ranunculaceae) using different parts of the plant ( leaf , perianth and pollen). Significant differences in alkaloid profiles between the two species were highlighted and discussed under taxonomic and evolutionary perspectives. Taken together , the presented approach constitutes a valuable chemotaxonomic tool in the search for known and unknown alkaloids from plants.
