 Sojae Semen Praeparatum ( SSP) is commonly used as a type of dietetic Chinese herb. By collecting and analyzing ancient and recent literatures , a textual criticism was conducted on the historical evolution of the processing of SSP. Fermented soybean was recorded in Shijing , and relevant rational processing was described in Qimin Yaoshu. In the early time , fermented soybean included the type of `` salty '' and `` light ''. After the Ming Dynasty , `` light '' fermented soybean or SSP was recognized as a better medicinal matter than salty fermented soybean , and the fermentation processing was recorded more clearly. In modern time , many characteristic methods for processing SSP have been developed. Today , the processing of SSP is mainly based on the Chinese Pharmacopoeia , which records soybean as a main ingredient and Artemisiae Annuae Herba , Mori Folium as excipients.
