 Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) is involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders in adults and elderly individuals , and as a result , the DNA methylation ( DNAm) of the BDNF gene in peripheral tissues including blood has been extensively examined to develop a useful biomarker for psychiatric disorders. However , studies to date have not previously investigated the effect of age on DNAm of the BDNF gene in blood. In this context , we measured DNAm of 39 CpG units in the CpG island<disease> at the promoter of exon I of the BDNF gene. We analyzed genomic DNA from peripheral blood of 105 health Japanese women 20 to 80 years of age to identify aging-associated change in DNAm of the BDNF gene. In addition , we examined the relationship between total MMSE scores , numbers of stressful life events , and serum BDNF levels on DNAm of the BDNF gene. The DNAm rate at each CpG unit was measured using a MassArray There was a significant correlation between DNAm and age in 13 CpGs. However , there was no significant correlation between DNAm and total MMSE scores , numbers of life events , or serum BDNF levels. Despite the small number of subjects and the inclusion of only female subjects , our results suggest that DNAm of 13 CpGs of the BDNF gene may be an appropriate biomarker for aging and useful for predicting increased susceptibility to age-related psychiatric disorders.
