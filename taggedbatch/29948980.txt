 The aim of this study was to develop benzydamine hydrochloride-loaded orodispersible films using the modification of a solvent casting method. An innovative approach was developed when the drying process of a small-scale production was used based on a heated inert base for casting the film. During this process , two types of film-forming maltodextrins for rapid drug delivery were used. They were plasticized with two different polyols ( xylitol and sorbitol). Superdisintegrant Kollidon ® CL-F was tested as an excipient that can induce faster disintegration of the prepared films. The influence of the formulation parameters ( dextrose equivalent of film-forming maltodextrins , a type of plasticizer , and the presence of superdisintegrant) on the disintegration time , mechanical properties , and moisture content of films was statistically evaluated using a multivariate data analysis. Orodispersible films containing maltodextrin with lower dextrose equivalent value showed better mechanical properties ( tensile strength ranged from 886.6 ± 30.2 to 1484.2 ± 226.9 N cm
