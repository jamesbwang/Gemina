 Although ageing is the main reason for cataract progression , pseudoexfoliation syndrome<disease><symptom> ( PES) represents an independent additional hazard for the development of nuclear sclerosis and cataract progression. PES can also affect corneal properties. From this perspective , this study aimed to perform a comparison of the corneal and lens densitometry measurements in eyes with PES and age-matched healthy eyes. This prospective cross-sectional study included 31 patients with unilateral PES and 40 control participants. The Pentacam HR imaging system was used to evaluate corneal densitometry ( 12 mm corneal diameter) and lens densitometry measurements of eyes with PES ( Group 1) , clinically unaffected fellow eyes ( Group 2) and healthy eyes ( Group 3). Eyes in Group 1 and Group 2 had statistically significantly higher corneal densitometry values for all concentric zones and layers compared with eyes in Group 3 ( p < 0.05 for all). However , the results were similar when Group 1 and Group 2 were compared ( p > 0.05 for all). The lens densitometry values of zone 1 , zone 2 and zone 3 , as well as the average lens densitometry measurements , were statistically significantly higher in Groups 1 and 2 , compared with Group 3 ( p < 0.05 for all). On the other hand , these parameters were similar between Groups 1 and 2 ( p > 0.05 for all). Additionally , there was no significant difference between the study and control groups with regard to the maximum lens densitometry measurements ( p > 0.05). This study revealed that corneal and lens densitometry values of affected and fellow eyes of cases with clinically unilateral PES are significantly higher than those of healthy subjects.
