 Soft<disease> tissue tumors around the knee joint still pose problems for the excision and subsequent reconstruction. In the 6 included patients the soft<disease> tissue sarcoma<disease> has its base on the anterior surface of the extensor mechanism and expands towards the skin. The entire extensor apparatus ( quadriceps tendon , patella , and patellar tendon) was resected and replaced by a fresh-frozen allograft. The mean follow-up was 6.7 years ( range: 2-12.4 years). In two patients a local recurrence occurred , resulting in a 5-year local recurrence-free rate of 66.7 % ( 95 % CI: 19.5 % -90.4 %). Distant metastases were found in 4 patients resulting in a 5-year metastasis-free rate of 33.3 % ( 95 % CI: 4.6 % -67.5 %). Two patients underwent at least one revision surgery , including one patient in whom the allograft had to be removed. According to the ISOLS function score 24.7 points ( range: 19-28 points) were achieved at the last follow-up. The mean active flexion of the knee joint was 82.5 째 ( range: 25-120 째) and a mean extension lag of 10 째 ( range: 0-30 째) was observed. The replacement of the extensor mechanism by an allograft is a reasonable option , allowing wide margins and restoration of active extension in most patients. The presented study is listed on the ISRCTN registry with trial number ISRCTN63060594.
