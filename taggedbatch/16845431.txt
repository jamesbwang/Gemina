 Intramolecular junctions are a ubiquitous structure within DNA and RNA; three-way junctions in particular have high strain around the junction because of the lack of flexibility , preventing the junctions from adopting conformations that would allow for optimal folding. In this work , we used a combination of calorimetric and spectroscopic techniques to study the unfolding of four intramolecular three-way junctions. The control three-way junction , 3H , has the sequence d ( GAAATTGCGCT
