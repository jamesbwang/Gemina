 Scimitar syndrome<disease><symptom> is characterized by partial or total anomalous pulmonary venous return from the right lung along with pulmonary hypoplasia. We present a case of a 37 weeks ' gestation male infant with antenatal ultrasound findings of suspected partial anomalous pulmonary venous return ( PAPVR) and coarctation of the aorta. The newborn presented with respiratory distress , a chest X-ray and chest computed tomography ( CT) angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of scimitar syndrome<disease><symptom>. The combination of scimitar syndrome<disease><symptom> with aortic coarctation is extremely rare with only a few cases previously reported.
