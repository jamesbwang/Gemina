 Bizarre paroxysmal osteochondromatous proliferation ( BPOP) is a rare benign neoplastic lesion<symptom> predominantly affecting small bones of the hand and known for its recurrence after local excision. We describe a rare case of BPOP involving second metacarpal of the dominant hand which was treated using a novel technique. Wide excision and reconstruction with non-vascularised fibular autograft was performed along with metacarpophalangeal joint replacement. At a follow up of two years , there was no evidence of recurrence and patient had good functional outcome. Hence this modality of treatment could be considered in dealing such cases of BPOP involving the small bones of hand.
