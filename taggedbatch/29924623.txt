 Delamination by osmotic swelling of layered materials is generally thought to become increasingly difficult , if not impossible , with increasing layer charge density because of strong Coulomb interactions. Nevertheless , for the class of 2:1 layered silicates , very few examples of delaminating organo-vermiculites were reported in literature. We propose a mechanism for this repulsive osmotic swelling of highly charged vermiculites based on repulsive counterion translational entropy that dominates the interaction of adjacent layers above a certain threshold separation. Based on this mechanistic insight , we were able to identify several organic interlayer cations appropriate to delaminate highly charged , vermiculite-type clay minerals. These findings suggest that the osmotic swelling of highly charged organoclays is a generally applicable phenomenon rather than the odd exemption.
