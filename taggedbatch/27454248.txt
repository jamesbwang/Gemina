 Retention in anti-retroviral therapy ( ART) presents a challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. In Mozambique , after roll-out to peripheral facilities , the 12-month retention rate was reported mostly from sites with an electronic patient tracking system ( EPTS) , representing only 65 % of patients. We conducted a nationally representative study , compared 12-month retention at EPTS and non-EPTS sites , and its predictors. Applying a proportionate to population size sampling strategy , we obtained a nationally representative sample of patients who initiated ART between January 2013 and June 2014. We calculated weighted proportions of the patients ' status at 12 months after ART initiation , and 12-month incidence of lost to follow-up ( LTFU) and death. We assessed determinants of LTFU and death by calculating adjusted hazard ratios ( AHR) through multivariate cox-proportional hazard models. Among 19,297 patients sampled , 54.3 % were still active , 33.1 % LTFU , 2.0 % dead , 2.6 % transferred-out and 8.0 % had unknown status , 12 months after ART initiation. Total attrition rate ( LTFU or dead) was 45.5/ 100PY , higher at facilities without EPTS ( 51.8/ 100PY) than with EPTS ( 37.7/ 100PY). Clinical stage IV ( AHR = 1.7) , CD4 count ≤ 150 ( AHR = 1.3) and being pregnant ( AHR = 1.6) were significantly associated with LTFU. Clinical stage III or IV ( AHR = 2.1 and 3.8) , CD4 count ≤ 150 ( AHR = 3.0) , not being pregnant ( AHR = 3.0) , and ART regimens with stavudine ( AHR = 4.28) were significantly associated with deaths. Patients enrolled in adherence support groups were 4.6 times less likely to be LTFU , but the number ( n = 174) was too small to be significant ( p = 0.273). Retention in ART was substantially lower at non-EPTS sites. EPTS should be expanded to all ART sites to facilitate comprehensive routine monitoring of retention in care. Retention in Mozambique is low and needs to be improved , especially among pregnant women and patients with advanced disease at ART initiation. The effect of ART adherence support groups needs to be further monitored.
