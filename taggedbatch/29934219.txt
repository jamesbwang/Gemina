 The natural product magnolol ( 1) and a selection of its bioinspired derivatives 2-5 , were investigated by Inverse Virtual Screening in order to identify putative biological targets from a panel of 308 proteins involved in cancer processes. By this in silico analysis we selected tankyrase-2 ( TNKS2) , casein kinase 2 ( CK2) and bromodomain 9 ( Brd9) as potential targets for experimental evaluations. The Surface Plasmon Resonance assay revealed that 3-5 present a good affinity for tankyrase-2 , and , in particular , 3 showed an antiproliferative activity on A549 cells higher than the well-known tankyrase-2 inhibitor XAV939 used as reference compound.
