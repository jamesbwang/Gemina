 This single-center retrospective analysis aimed to evaluate the prognostic relevance of 6-min walk test ( 6MWT) in patients admitted to an in-hospital cardiovascular rehabilitation program after open-heart valve surgery. One hundred one patients able to perform a 6MWT within the first week of admission ( time after surgery: 16 ± 8 d) were included ( age 68 ± 11 y; 55 % female; median left ventricular ejection fraction 55 % ( interquartile range: 50-60); 51 % after aortic valve surgery). Study endpoints were cardiovascular death and the combined outcome of cardiovascular death/cardiac hospitalization. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze predictive value of the 6MWT. After a median follow-up of 27 mo , cardiovascular mortality was 9.9 % while combined endpoint occurrence was 33 %. Patients experiencing study endpoints had lower left ventricular ejection fraction , higher N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide serum levels , and longer in-hospital stay ( all P < .05). The 6MWT distance was a significant predictor of cardiovascular death ( hazard ratio ( HR) = 0.89 , 95 % CI: 0.81-0.97 , P = .007) and cardiac hospitalizations ( HR = 0.95 , 95 % CI: 0.90-0.99 , P = .02). Even after adjusting for the relevant confounding variables of cardiovascular death and cardiac hospitalization , the adjusted HR = 0.88 , 95 % CI: 0.75-0.98 , P = .028 and adjusted HR = 0.95 , 95 % CI: 0.90-0.99 , P = .05 , respectively. In patients admitted to an in-hospital cardiovascular rehabilitation program after open-heart valve surgery , 6MWT proved to be an independent prognostic tool , potentially allowing identification of high-risk patients for whom a more intensive and tailored in-hospital cardiovascular rehabilitation program should be designed and implemented in order to avoid unfavorable cardiovascular events.
