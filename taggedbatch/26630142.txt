 By the very nature of things there are many overlaps between urology and nephrology. A close cooperation between the two disciplines is necessary for the benefit of the patient. From a nephrological perspective this article explains when and why participation of a nephrologist in treatment is recommended. In this context three essential points are explained: with respect to early recognition , renal hematuria<symptom> , microalbuminuria , proteinuria<symptom> , limited renal filtration function and glomerular filtration rate ( GFR) are signs of renal disease; however , even patients with renal cysts<symptom> should consult a nephrologist as early as possible due to the currently available treatment options. A delay in progression is possible and necessary for all chronic kidney diseases , independent of the trigger. Even when changes in the life style of the patient is troublesome and the adjustment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia sounds banal , their consistent implementation can result in a marked delay in the necessity for dialysis. The treatment of renal comorbidities is decisive and depends on the severity of the kidney disease. This includes the treatment of renal<symptom> anemia<symptom> , arterial hypertension , metabolic acidosis , uremic complications , electrolyte and water balance<symptom> dysregulation and secondary hyperparathyroidism. By treating these comorbidities a marked reduction in the increased cardiovascular risk of nephrology patients can be achieved.
