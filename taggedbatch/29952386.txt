 Within the general framework of our past and current studies dealing with the investigation of the photophysical properties and the biological behavior of the family of tetrazolato and tetrazole Re ( i) complexes , we have endeavored to investigate their potential in the luminescent staining of proteins purified by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. With the aim to provide the first examples of luminescent Re ( i) complexes to be exploited for this specific purpose , we have designed and prepared four new Re ( i)- based species with the general formula fac- ( Re ( CO) 3 ( N ^ N) ( Tph)) 2- / 0 , where Tph is the 5- ( phenyl) tetrazolato anion and N ^ N is in turn represented by bathophenanthroline disulfonate ( BPS) , bathocuproine disulfonate ( BCS) or by the SO3- free bathocuproine ( BC). In this latter case , the neutral complex fac- ( Re ( CO) 3 ( BC) ( Tph)) served as a model species for the characterization of the former disulfonate complexes. Its cationic analogue fac- ( Re ( CO) 3 ( BC) ( Tph-Me)) + was also prepared by a straightforward methylation reaction. All complexes displayed bright phosphorescence in organic media and , relative to their water solubility , the dianionic species fac- ( Re ( CO) 3 ( BPS) ( Tph)) 2- and fac- ( Re ( CO) 3 ( BCS) ( Tph)) 2- were also highly emissive in aqueous solution. The sulfonate groups played a key role in promoting and significantly enhancing the luminescent staining performances of both the Re ( i) complexes fac- ( Re ( CO) 3 ( BPS) ( Tph)) 2- and fac- ( Re ( CO) 3 ( BCS) ( Tph)) 2- for proteins. Highlighting a response superior to that of Coomassie Blue and comparable to the one obtained by the well-known silver staining method , these dianionic Re ( i)- complexes could efficiently detect up to 50 ng of pure Bovine Serum Albumin ( BSA) , as well as all proteins found in a Standard Protein Marker mix and from a total protein extract. A lower but still good response for luminescent protein staining was surprisingly obtained by employing the- SO3- free neutral and cationic complexes fac- ( Re ( CO) 3 ( BC) ( Tph)) and fac- ( Re ( CO) 3 ( BC) ( Tph-Me)) + , respectively. These preliminary results open up new possibilities for the further widening of the use of Re ( i)- based complexes as luminescent protein staining agents.
