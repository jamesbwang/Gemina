 C-reactive protein ( CRP) is an acute-phase protein synthesized by hepatocytes in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines during inflammatory/infectious processes. CRP exists in conformationally distinct forms such as the native pentameric CRP and monomeric CRP ( mCRP) and may bind to distinct receptors and lipid rafts and exhibit different functional properties. It is known as a biomarker of acute<symptom> inflammation<symptom> , but many large-scale prospective studies demonstrate that CRP is also known to be associated with chronic inflammation<symptom>. This review is focused on discussing the clinical significance of CRP in chronic<disease> inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases , such as cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes mellitus , age-related macular degeneration , hemorrhagic stroke , Alzheimer 's disease , and Parkinson 's disease , including recent advances on the implication of CRP and its forms specifically on the pathogenesis of these diseases. Overall , we highlight the advances in these areas that may be translated into promising measures for the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>.
