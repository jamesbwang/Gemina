 Tensan silk , a natural fiber produced by the Japanese oak silk moth ( Antherea yamamai , abbreviated to A. yamamai) , features superior characteristics , such as compressive elasticity and chemical resistance , when compared to the more common silk produced from the domesticated silkworm , Bombyx mori ( B. mori). In this study , the `` structure-property '' relationships within A. yamamai silk are disclosed from the different structural hierarchies , confirming the outstanding toughness as dominated by the distinct mesoscale fibrillar architectures. Inspired by this hierarchical construction , we fabricated A. yamamai silk-like regenerated B. mori silk fibers ( RBSFs) with mechanical properties ( extensibility and modulus) comparable to natural A. yamamai silk. These RBSFs were further functionalized to form conductive RBSFs that were sensitive to force and temperature stimuli for applications in smart textiles. This study provides a blueprint in exploiting rational designs from A. yamanmai , which is rare and expensive in comparison to the common and cost-effective B. mori silk to empower enhanced material properties.
