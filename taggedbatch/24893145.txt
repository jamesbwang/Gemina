 Calcium electroporation ( CaEP) is a novel anti-tumour treatment that induces cell death by internalization of large quantities of calcium. The anti-tumour effectiveness of CaEP has been demonstrated in vitro , in vivo , and in preliminary clinical trials; however , its effects on the vasculature have not been previously investigated. Using a dorsal window chamber tumour model , we observed that CaEP affected to the same degree normal and tumour blood vessels in vivo , as it disrupted the vessels and caused tumour eradication by necrosis<symptom>. In all cases , the effect was more pronounced in small vessels , similar to electrochemotherapy ( ECT) with bleomycin. In vitro studies in four different cell lines ( the B16F1 melanoma , HUVEC endothelial , FADU squamous cell carcinoma , and CHO cell lines) confirmed that CaEP causes necrosis<symptom> associated with acute and severe ATP depletion , a picture different from bleomycin with electroporation. Furthermore , CaEP considerably inhibited cell migratory capabilities of endothelial cells and their potential to form capillary-like structures. The finding that CaEP has anti-vascular effects and inhibits cell migration capabilities may contribute to the explanation of the high efficacy observed in preclinical and clinical studies.
