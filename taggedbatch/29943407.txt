 Mesenteric tumor deposits are a frequent occurrence in small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors. In many instances , these mesenteric tumor deposits are surrounded by a dense fibrotic stroma and have associated lymphoplasmacytic inflammation<symptom>. These histologic features seen around mesenteric tumor deposits can be a histologic mimic of IgG4-related mesenteritis , especially when tumor cells are not sampled. Sixty-six mesenteric tumor deposits from 66 patients with small intestinal neuroendocrine tumor were identified from our archives with blocks available for further studies. Cases were assessed for clinicopathologic features and presence of IgG4-positive and IgG-positive plasma cells by immunohistochemistry. Ratios of IgG4-positive to IgG-positive cells were calculated. Seventeen mesenteric tumor deposits ( 26 %) showed greater than 40 IgG4-positive plasma cells per high-power field , and the majority of cases ( 68 %) showed at least some staining of IgG4-positive plasma cells. Mesenteric tumor deposits with > 20 IgG4-positve plasma cells per high power field tended to be larger ( 2.59 ± 1.30 cm versus 1.86 ± 1.58 cm , P = 0.07) and had more IgG-positive cells ( 88 ± 24 versus 36 ± 37; P < 0.01) and a higher ratio of IgG4-positive to IgG-positive cells ( 0.66 ± 0.18 versus 0.17 ± 0.25; P < 0.01). All but one mesenteric tumor deposits with > 20 IgG4-positve plasma cells had a ratio of > 40 %. IgG4 expression is frequent in mesenteric tumor deposits from small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors. Undersampling of tumor on biopsies of mesenteric tumor deposits could potentially cause diagnostic confusion<symptom> with IgG4-related sclerosing mesenteritis.
