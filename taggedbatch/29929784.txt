 Pancreatic head adenocarcinoma is commonly diagnosed at an advanced stage when adjacent vascular invasion is present. This study aimed to establish a preoperative prognostic nomogram for patients who underwent attempted curative resectional surgery for pancreatic head cancer with suspected peripancreatic venous invasion. Data on all consecutive patients were retrospectively collected from 2012 to 2016 at four academic institutions. The demographic and radiological parameters were analyzed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The final nomogram was established using the concordance Harrell 's C-indices and calibration curves from data obtained in three institutions and validated in the cohort of patients coming from the fourth institution. The nomogram was constructed using data from 178 patients while the validation cohort consisted of 61 patients. Age , length of tumor contact , peripancreatic venous abnormalities and Lymph node staging were independent factors of overall survival. The nomogram showed good probabilities of survival on calibration curves. The C-index of the model in predicting overall survival ( OS) was 0.824 for the validation cohort. The nomogram accurately predicted OS in patients with pancreatic head cancer with suspected peripancreatic venous invasion after attempted curative pancreatic resectional surgery.
