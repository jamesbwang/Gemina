 Researchers agree that comprehenders regularly predict upcoming language , but they do not always agree on what prediction is ( and how to differentiate it from integration) or what constitutes evidence for it. After defining prediction , we show that it occurs at all linguistic levels from semantics to form , and then propose a theory of which mechanisms comprehenders use to predict. We argue that they most effectively predict using their production system ( i.e. , prediction-by-production): They covertly imitate the linguistic form of the speaker 's utterance and construct a representation of the underlying communicative intention. Comprehenders can then run this intention through their own production system to prepare the predicted utterance. But doing so takes time and resources , and comprehenders vary in the extent of preparation , with many groups of comprehenders ( non-native speakers , illiterates , children , and older adults) using it less than typical native young adults. We thus argue that prediction-by-production is an optional mechanism , which is augmented by mechanisms based on association. Support for our proposal comes from many areas of research ( electrophysiological , eye-tracking , and behavioral studies of reading , spoken language processing in the context of visual environments , speech processing , and dialogue).
