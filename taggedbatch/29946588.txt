 Despite the intrinsic advantages of ultra-high theoretical capacity and energy density of lithium-O2 batteries , there remain several critical issues to be resolved , especially the two concerning poor cyclability and rate capability. In this work , CxNy particles@N-doped porous graphene ( CxNy@NPG) with a novel three-dimensional architecture is successfully synthesized via a simple template method and employed as the cathode catalyst of Li-O2 batteries. It is surprisingly found that the as-synthesized CxNy@NPG cathode not only demonstrates a remarkable cycling performance of 200 cycles at 1000 mA g-1 but also an intriguing high-rate capability with 8892 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 , both of which can be attributed to a synergistic effect between the unique 3D porous structure and an effective N-doping. Specifically , it is believed that the unique porous 3D structure will , on one hand , build numerous microchannels , thus facilitating rapid O2 diffusion , and on the other hand , provide sufficient storage space to accommodate adequate discharge products. Indispensably , it is also believed that the N-doped porous graphene enables improved bifunctional catalytic activities towards both oxygen reduction reaction ( ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction ( OER) , thus decreasing the discharge/charge overpotential , and reducing undesired side reactions. It is anticipated that the new 3D porous CxNy@NPG provides an inspiring route to design long cycling and high-rate performance cathodes for Li-O2 batteries.
