 Four-component reaction between primary amines , dialkylacetylendicarboxylates , tetrazolo ( 1,5-a) quinoline-4-carbaldehyde and ethyl-2-cyanoacetate in the presence of 1,4-diaza-bicyclo ( 2.2.2) octane and zinc oxide nanoparticles results to the regioselective production of new tetrazolo ( 1,5-a) quinoline-based 2-amino-1,4-dihydropyridine or pyridin-2 ( 1H)- one derivatives in good to high yields. The selectivity of the catalyzed reaction toward the generation of the dihydropyridine or pyridin-2 ( 1H)- one derivatives was found to be strongly dependent on the size of the alkyl groups in the ester moieties of the acetylenic esters. According to single-crystal X-ray diffraction and NMR studies , the pyridin-2 ( 1H)- one derivatives involve a restricted rotation around the C-C bond connecting the tetrazoloquinoline and dihydropyridinone cyclic systems.
