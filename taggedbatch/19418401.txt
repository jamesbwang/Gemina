 The Japan Esophageal Society created a working committee group consisting of 11 expert endoscopists and 2 pathologists with expertise in Barrett 's esophagus ( BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The group developed a consensus-based classification for the diagnosis of superficial BE-related neoplasms using magnifying endoscopy. The classification has three characteristics: simplified , an easily understood classification by incorporating the diagnostic criteria for the early gastric cancer , including the white zone and demarcation line , and the presence of a modified flat pattern corresponding to non-dysplastic histology by adding novel diagnostic criteria. Magnifying endoscopic findings are composed of mucosal and vascular patterns , and are initially classified as `` visible '' or `` invisible. '' Morphologic features were evaluated for `` visible '' patterns , and were subsequently rated as `` regular '' or `` irregular , '' and the histology , non-dysplastic or dysplastic , was predicted. We introduce the process and outline of the magnifying endoscopic classification.
