 <br> Background/Aims: Zeitgeber time ( ZT)- dependent changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis are regulated by melatonin receptor ( MT)- mediated signaling in the adult hippocampus and hypothalamic-hypophyseal system. There are two G-protein-coupled MT-subtypes , MT1 and MT2. Therefore , the present study examined which MT-subtype is required for regulation of ZT-dependent changes in cell proliferation and/or apoptosis in the adult murine brain and pituitary. Adult melatonin-proficient ( C3H) mice with targeted deletion of MT1 ( MT1 KO) or MT2 ( MT2 KO) were adapted to a 12-hour light , 12-hour dark photoperiod and sacrificed at ZT00 , ZT06 , ZT12 , and ZT18. Immunohistochemistry for Ki67 or activated caspase-3 served to quantify proliferating and apoptotic cells in the hippocampal subgranular zone ( SGZ) and granule cell layer , the hypothalamic median eminence ( ME) , and the hypophyseal pars tuberalis. ZT-dependent changes in cell proliferation were found exclusively in the SGZ and ME of MT1 KO mice , while apoptosis showed no ZT-dependent changes in the regions analyzed , neither in MT1 nor in MT2 KO mice. Comparison with our previous studies in C3H mice with functional MTs and MT1/2 KO mice revealed that MT2-mediated signaling is required and sufficient for ZT-dependent changes in cell proliferation in the SGZ and ME , while ZT-dependent changes in apoptosis require signaling from both MT-subtypes. Our results indicate that generation and timing of ZT-dependent changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis by melatonin require different MT-subtype-constellations and emphasize the importance to shed light on the specific function of each receptor-subtype in different tissues and physiological conditions. <br>.
