 The twinning and slip modes of a rolled magnesium alloy sheet were investigated through quasi-in-situ tensile tests that were carried out along the rolling direction at room temperature with a constant strain rate. Scanning electron microscopy and electron backscattered diffraction observations were used to identify activated twinning and slip systems. Schmid factors were calculated to analyze different deformation modes. The analyses show that a small number of ( 10-12) tensile twins were present during deformation , and these twins resulted from the accommodation of compression along the tensile direction. Post-deformation examination revealed the dominance of prismatic slip.
