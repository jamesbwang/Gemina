 Injuries to the skin are often complicated by invasive<disease> infections<disease>. Standard treatment with intravenous antibiotics has limited tissue penetration and sometimes , major systemic toxicity. Traditional topical delivery of antimicrobials also has limited effectiveness and duration of action. We demonstrate the use of a new Platform Wound<disease><symptom> Device ( PWD) for delivery of topical , ultrahigh concentrations of minocycline as well as lidocaine onto the burn eschar and on the surface of excisional wounds<disease><symptom> in a total of 56 burn wounds<disease><symptom> and 24 excisional wounds<disease><symptom> in a porcine model. Wounds<disease><symptom> were created on day 0 , debrided on day 3 , and pigs were killed on day 7. After 3 days of PWD with minocycline treatment , bacterial count was 5.44 log CFU/g in dorsal wound<disease><symptom> tissue inoculated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , less than that after treatment with silver sulfadiazine cream ( 7.64 log CFU/g). Pain was also relieved or eliminated in burn wounds<disease><symptom> and full-thickness excisional wounds<disease><symptom> when lidocaine was delivered by the PWD. The results demonstrate that ultrahigh concentrations of antibiotics can be delivered effectively by the PWD , and will accelerate wound<disease><symptom> bed preparation.
