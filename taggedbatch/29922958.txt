 Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) provides high-quality soft-tissue images of anatomical structures and radiation free imaging. The research community has focused on establishing new workflows , developing new technology , and creating robotic devices to change an MRI room from a solely diagnostic room to an interventional suite , where diagnosis and intervention can both be done in the same room. Closed bore MRI scanners provide limited access for interventional procedures using intraoperative imaging. MRI robots could improve access and procedure accuracy. Different research groups have focused on different technology aspects and anatomical structures. This paper presents the results of a systematic search of MRI robots for needle-based interventions. We report the most recent advances in the field , present relevant technologies , and discuss possible future advances. This survey shows that robotic-assisted MRI-guided prostate biopsy has received the most interest from the research community to date. Multiple successful clinical experiments have been reported in recent years that show great promise. However , in general the field of MRI robotic systems is still in the early stage. The continued development of these systems , along with partnerships with commercial vendors to bring this technology to market , is encouraged to create new and improved treatment opportunities for future patients.
