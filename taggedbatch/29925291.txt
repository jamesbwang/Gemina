 Alcohol withdrawal syndrome<disease><symptom> ( AWS) is a common reason for admission to a medical intensive care unit ( MICU) and requires significant hospital resource utilization. Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy for AWS in many intensive care units. We propose the use of symptom-triggered phenobarbital for the treatment of AWS as a safe alternative to benzodiazepines. This was a retrospective observational study of a 4-year period , 2011 to 2015 , of all patients with AWS admitted to the MICU of 1 tertiary care hospital and treated with phenobarbital. A symptom-triggered protocol was used. Resolution of AWS was assessed with the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale to goal score of 0 to -1. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was used as an index of patient illness severity. Complications associated with phenobarbital use and/or the AWS admission were analyzed. Data of 86 AWS patient encounters were analyzed. The mean Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised score of patients admitted to the MICU with AWS was 19 ± 9. The mean phenobarbital dose administered during the MICU stay was 1977.5 ± 1531.5 mg. There were a total of 17 ( 20 %) intubations. The most frequent cause of mechanical ventilation in patients with AWS was loss of airway clearance , followed by hemodynamic<symptom> instability<symptom> secondary to upper gastrointestinal bleeding and the corresponding need for endoscopy. Sole use of phenobarbital use for control of AWS may be a safe alternative to benzodiazepines. Further study is needed to correlate phenobarbital serum levels with clinical control of AWS.
