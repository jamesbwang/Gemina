 Mosquitoes transmit a diverse group of human flaviviruses including West<pathogen><disease> Nile , dengue<pathogen><disease> , yellow<pathogen><disease><symptom> fever<disease><symptom> , and Zika viruses. Mosquitoes are also naturally infected with insect-specific flaviviruses ( ISFs) , a subgroup of the family not capable of infecting vertebrates. Although ISFs are not medically important , they are capable of altering the mosquito 's susceptibility to flaviviruses and may alter host fitness.
