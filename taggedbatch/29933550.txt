 Obesity is one of the greatest health challenges facing today & rsquo; s adolescents. Dietary interventions are the foundation of obesity prevention and management. As adolescents are digital frontrunners and early adopters of technology , digital health interventions appear the most practical modality for dietary behavior change interventions. Despite the rapid growth in digital health interventions , effective engagement with adolescents remains a pertinent issue. Key strategies for effective engagement include co-designing interventions with adolescents , personalization of interventions , and just-in-time adaptation using data from wearable devices. The aim of this paper is to appraise these strategies , which may be used to improve effective engagement and thereby improve the dietary behaviors of adolescents now and in the future.
