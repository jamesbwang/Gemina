 Mounting evidence indicates that long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) play a critical role in tumorigenesis. LncRNA LINC00313 has been found to be upregulated and associated with the poor prognosis of lung cancer. However , the potential role and clinical value of LINC00313 in human papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC) remain elusive and need to be examined. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of LINC00313 in PTC. We found that the expression of LINC00313 was significantly upregulated in PTC tissues and cell lines and that this upregulation was correlated with a poor prognosis. In vitro experiments indicated that downregulation of LINC00313 inhibited the proliferative , migratory and colony-forming abilities of PTC cells. Moreover , silencing LINC00313 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PTC cells. Mechanism studies showed that LINC00313 downregulates miR-4429 expression. Overexpression of miR-4429 could abrogate the oncogenic role of LINC00313 in PTC cells. In summary , our data revealed that LINC00313 acts as an oncogene in PTC via sponging miR-4429. Our data suggested that LINC00313 might be applied as a therapeutic target for PTC.
