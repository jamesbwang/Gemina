 Intussusception is a rare condition in the adult population: it is responsible for 1 % of all bowel obstructions. In most of intussusceptions a malignant tumor is involved; a lot of studies show that approximately 50 % of malignant metastases causing small bowel intussusception are metastatic melanomas. In present paper a case of a small bowel intussusception probably due to metastases of an occult melanoma , in a 69-year-old patient , is presented. Surgery resection , careful research of possible primitive neoplasms and an accurate follow-up program has been the treatment of choice. All the investigations carried out did not allow to identify a possible primitive neoplasm. The last whole body PET carried out 44 months after surgery resulted disease-free.
