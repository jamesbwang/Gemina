 Results of a comparison of blood product use and cost outcomes with use of 3-factor versus 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate ( PCC) for indications other than warfarin reversal are presented. Consecutive patients who received 3-factor PPC ( PCC3) or 4-factor PCC ( PCC4) for non-warfarin-related indications at 2 U.S. hospitals during a 19-month period were identified. The primary outcome was in-hospital blood product use , with a focus on plasma use. Total hemostasis costs , intensive care unit ( ICU) and hospital lengths of stay , and other outcomes were evaluated. Indications for PCC3 use ( PCC3 use and PCC4 use were associated with similar blood product use , ICU length of stay , hospital length of stay , and in-hospital mortality when given for non-warfarin-related indications. However , relative to PCC3 use , PCC4 use was associated with an increase in costs that was primarily due to drug costs.
