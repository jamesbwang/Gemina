 ( 1) Background: Global agricultural production is projected to increase substantially in the coming decades. Agricultural production provides food and materials crucial to human survival and well-being and is a critical source of livelihood , providing employment opportunities and economic benefits. However , industrialized or intensified agricultural systems , in particular , can have adverse effects on public health , place pressure on natural resources , and reduce environmental sustainability. This review attempts to identify and characterize key environmental health assessment methods for examining a broad array of potential impacts; ( 2) Methods: Electronic databases Medline , Scopus , Web of Science , and GreenLINE were searched for published literature that presented methods for conducting an environmental health assessment of an agricultural system; ( 3) Results: Fifty-three sources were included in the review. Eight methods were selected to illustrate the wide range of approaches currently available: health risk assessment methods , health impact assessment , environmental impact assessment methods , environmental burden of disease , lifecycle methods , integrated assessment modeling , trade-off analysis , and economic assessment; ( 4) Conclusions: This review can provide guidance for selecting an existing method or for designing a new method for assessing the environmental health impacts of an agricultural system.
