 Proximal femur replacements in patients with sarcoma<disease> are associated with high rates of infection. This study is the largest one comparing infection rates with titanium versus silver-coated megaprostheses in sarcoma<disease> patients. Infection rates were assessed in 99 patients with proximal femur sarcoma<disease> who underwent placement of a titanium ( n = 35) or silver-coated ( n = 64) megaprosthesis. Treatments administered for infection were also analyzed. Infections occurred in 14.3 % of patients in the titanium group , in comparison with 9.4 % of those in the silver group , when the development of infection was the primary end point. The 5- and 10-year event-free survival rates for the prosthesis relative to the parameter of infection were 90 % in the silver group and 83 % in the titanium group. The overall infection rates were 10.9 % in the silver group and 20 % in the titanium group. Two patients each in the silver and titanium groups ultimately had to undergo amputation. The need for two-stage prosthesis exchanges ( 57.1 % in the titanium group) declined to 14.3 % in the silver group. Using a silver-coated proximal femoral replacement nearly halved the overall infection rate. When infections occurred , it was usually possible to avoid two-stage prosthesis exchanges in the silver group.
