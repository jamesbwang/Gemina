Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure ( DREEM) questionnaire was distributed among 497 undergraduate dental students , in the second week of the first semester of the academic year , from second year students to interns studying in the College of Dentistry of King Saud University ( KSU). Response rate was 60.73 %. Mean for the total DREEM scores was 108.42/ 200. DREEM subscales mean were above 50 % of the total score.
