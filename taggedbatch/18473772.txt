 The receptor tyrosine kinase MET and its ligand , the Hepatocyte Growth Factor/Scattor Factor ( HGF/SF) , are essential to the migration , morphogenesis , and survival of epithelial cells. In addition , dysregulation of MET signaling has been shown to promote tumor progression and invasion in many cancers. Therefore , HGF/SF and MET are major targets for chemotherapies. Improvement of targeted therapies requires a perfect understanding of tumor microenvironment that strongly modifies half-life , bio-accessibility and thus , efficacy of treatments. In particular , hypoxia is a crucial microenvironmental phenomenon promoting invasion and resistance to treatments. Under hypoxia , MET auto-phosphorylation resulting from ligand stimulation or from receptor overexpression is drastically decreased within minutes of oxygen deprivation but is quickly reversible upon return to normoxia. Besides a decreased phosphorylation of its proximal adaptor GAB1 under hypoxia , activation of the downstream kinases Erk and Akt is maintained , while still being dependent on MET receptor. Consistently , several cellular responses induced by HGF/SF , including motility , morphogenesis , and survival are effectively induced under hypoxia. Interestingly , using a semi-synthetic ligand , we show that HGF/SF binding to MET is strongly impaired during hypoxia but can be quickly restored upon reoxygenation. Finally , we show that two MET-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs) are less efficient on MET signalling under hypoxia. Like MET loss of phosphorylation , this hypoxia-induced resistance to TKIs is reversible under normoxia. Thus , although hypoxia does not affect downstream signaling or cellular responses induced by MET , it causes immediate resistance to TKIs. These results may prove useful when designing and evaluation of MET-targeted therapies against cancer.
