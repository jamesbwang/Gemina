 Previously , the family of S100A proteins has been found to be associated with inflammation<symptom> and myelopoiesis and to be able to induce or support myeloproliferation during chronic inflammation<symptom>. Here , we studied the inflammatory myeloid-related proteins S100A4 , S100A8 , S100A9 and S100A12 in myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPNs) in order to assess the involvement of chronic inflammation<symptom> in the pathogenesis of MPN. We analyzed the S100A4 , S100A8 , S100A9 and S100A12 mRNA and protein levels in the bone<disease> marrow and circulation of 140 patients with MPN and 15 healthy controls using Western blotting , microarray-based mRNA expression profiling and ELISA assays , respectively. In addition we performed functional studies on the proliferation-related AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways in MPN-derived granulocytes using Western blotting and proteomic analyses. We found that the S100A mRNA levels were increased in MPN patient-derived circulatory CD34 From our data we conclude that the S100A8 and S100A9 granulocyte and plasma levels are increased in MPN patients , along with inflammation<symptom> markers , depending on their JAK2V617F mutation allele burden. We also found that S100A8/9-mediated inhibition of the proliferation-related AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways can be decreased by CALR mutation-dependent TLR4 blocking and increased by RAGE inhibition in MPN.
