 We report the species detected in dogs and humans from outbreaks of visceral leishmaniasis<disease> in Colombia. In this study , 91 sera from patients ( n = 38) and dogs ( n = 53) diagnosed with visceral leishmaniasis<disease> using IFAT were analyzed to determine the causative species. DNA extraction , PCR amplification , DNA sequencing and species identification was performed. Results were obtained with 13 of the sera. A phylogenetic tree and a network of haplotypes were constructed. Leishmania<pathogen> infantum chagasi ( 11/13) , Leishmania<pathogen> braziliensis ( 1/13) and Leishmania amazonensis ( 1/13) were identified as the circulating species and genetic variability in one of the L. infantum chagasi strains was demonstrated. This is the first study describing Leishmania<pathogen> species in outbreaks of visceral leishmaniasis<disease> in Colombia.
