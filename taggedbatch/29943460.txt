 The aim of the current paper is to evaluate clinical characteristics of 30 children with early onset anorexia<symptom> nervosa ( EO-AN; age = 12.2 ± 1.6 years) compared with 30 patients with adolescent onset AN ( AO-AN; age = 15.9 ± 0.7 years) and 60 age-matched healthy controls. Statistical analyses included one-way analyses of variance with three planned comparisons and chi-square tests. Compared with AO-AN , EO-AN patients displayed more restrictive eating behaviour ( p = 0.038) , received more tube-feeding ( p = 0.024) , and had less problems with self-esteem ( p < 0.001) and perfectionism ( p = 0.001). EO-AN patients have similar eating disorder pathology ( p = 0.183) , body-image distortion ( p = 0.060) , and number of hospitalizations ( p = 0.358) as AO-AN. Only a third of EO-AN patients suffer from low self-esteem. Overall , core AN pathology seems similar in EO-AN and AO-AN. However , EO-AN patients show differences in their pathological eating behaviour and the need for tube-feeding.
