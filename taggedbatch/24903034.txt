 Eating disorders comorbid with depression<symptom> are an established risk factor for suicide. In this study , we aimed to determine the effects of binge eating ( BE) symptoms on suicidality and related clinical characteristics in major depressive disorder ( MDD). A total of 817 community participants with MDD were included. We compared two groups ( with and without lifetime BE symptoms). The MDD with BE group was subdivided into a frequent BE ( FBE) subgroup ( BE symptoms greater than twice weekly) and any BE ( ABE) subgroup ( BE symptoms greater than twice weekly). The MDD with BE group comprised 142 ( 17.38 %) patients. The FBE and ABE subgroups comprised 75 ( 9.18 %) and 67 ( 8.20 %) patients , respectively. Comorbid alcohol use disorder , anxiety<symptom> disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) and history of suicide attempt were significantly more frequent in the MDD with BE group than MDD without BE group. Sexual trauma was also reported more frequently in MDD with BE group. No significant differences were observed between the ABE and FBE subgroups. Multivariate logistic regression revealed an association of suicide attempt with BE symptoms and sexual trauma. Structural equation modeling showed that sexual trauma increased BE ( β = 0.337 , P < 0.001) together with alcohol use ( β = 0.185 , P < 0.001) and anxiety<symptom> ( β = 0.299 , p < 0.001) , which in turn increased suicide attempt ( β = 0.087 , p = 0.011). BE symptoms were associated with suicide attempt in MDD after adjusting for other factors associated with suicidality. BE symptoms also moderated an association between suicide attempt and sexual trauma.
