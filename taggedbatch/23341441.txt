 Cell therapy presents a promising alternative for the treatment of degenerative diseases. The main sources of adult stem cells are bone<disease> marrow , adipose tissue and peripheral blood. Within those tissues , there are cell subpopulations that share pluripotential characteristics. Nevertheless , there is insufficient data to determine which of these stem cell subtypes would have a better possibility to differentiate to a specific tissue. The objective of this research was to analyze and compare the stemness genes expression from peripheral blood and adipose tissue of plastic adherent cells , and those immune-selected by the CD133
