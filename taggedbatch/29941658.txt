 The relation between tea consumption and age-related changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) concentrations remains unclear , and longitudinal human data are limited. The aim of current study was to examine the relation between tea intake and longitudinal change in HDL-C concentrations. Baseline ( 2006) tea consumption was assessed via a questionnaire , and plasma HDL-C concentrations were measured in 2006 , 2008 , 2010 , and 2012 among 80 182 individuals ( 49 Â± 12 years of age) who did not have cardiovascular diseases or cancer , or did not use cholesterol-lowering agents both at baseline ( 2006) and during the follow-up period ( 2006-2012). The associations between baseline tea consumption and rate of change in HDL-C concentrations were examined using generalized estimating equation models. Tea consumption was inversely associated with a decreased rate of HDL-C concentrations ( Tea consumption was associated with slower age-related decreases in HDL-C concentrations during 6 years of follow-up.
