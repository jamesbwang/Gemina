 To investigate the fidelity of canonical non-homologous end joining ( C-NHEJ) , we developed an assay to detect EJ between distal ends of two Cas9-induced chromosomal breaks that are joined without causing insertion/deletion mutations ( indels). Here we find that such EJ requires several core C-NHEJ factors , including XLF. Using variants of this assay , we find that C-NHEJ is required for EJ events that use 1-2 , but not â‰¥ 3 , nucleotides of terminal microhomology. We also investigated XLF residues required for EJ without indels , finding that one of two binding domains is essential ( L115 or C-terminal lysines that bind XRCC4 and KU/DNA , respectively) , and that disruption of one of these domains sensitizes XLF to mutations that affect its dimer interface , which we examined with molecular dynamic simulations. Thus , C-NHEJ , including synergistic function of distinct XLF domains , is required for EJ of chromosomal breaks without indels.
