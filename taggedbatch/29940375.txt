 Valproate ( VPA) is a broad spectrum antiepileptic drug ( AED) that is generally used as a first line agent for most idiopathic and symptomatic generalized epilepsies. Many studies have indicated that AEDs cause reproductive endocrine disorders in males , but the exact etiology underpinning these dysfunctions is not clear. This meta-analysis and systematic review was intended to evaluate the effect of VPA on reproductive endocrine function in male patients with epilepsy. A literature search was performed using electronic databases up to December 2017 for eligible studies. The differences in the levels of the reproductive factors , luteinizing hormone ( LH) , follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH) , sex hormone binding globulin ( SHBG) , testosterone , dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate ( DHEAS) , and androstenedione ( ADION) in the male patients with epilepsy treated with VPA ( treatment group) were compared with the those of the healthy controls ( control group) by the use of the Standardized mean difference ( SMD) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). Six publications with a total of 316 subjects were identified. The result revealed that the levels of FSH ( SMD = -1.33 , 95 % CI: -2.60 to -0.07 , P = 0.039) and testosterone ( SMD = -0.45 , 95 % CI: -0.87 to -0.03 , P = 0.038) of the treatment group were decreased significantly compared with the healthy controls. There was an increase in the levels of SHBG ( SMD = 0.41 , 95 % CI: -0.21 to 1.03 , P = 0.197) , DHEAS ( SMD = 0.20 , 95 % CI: -0.06 to 0.45 , P = 0.126) and ADION ( SMD = 0.73 , 95 % CI: -0.10 to 1.57 , P = 0.086) , and a decrease in that of LH ( SMD = -0.71 , 95 % CI: -1.49 to 0.07 , P = 0.075) in the male patients with epilepsy treated with VPA , but the differences did not reach statistical significance ( P > 0.05). This meta-analysis indicates that VPA may lead to a significant decrease in the levels of FSH and testosterone and alter the concentrations of LH , DHEAS , SHBG , and ADION to some extent , which might contribute to the reproductive endocrine dysfunction in male patients with epilepsy. It is important for clinical neurologists to be cautious when prescribing VPA to reproductive-aged male patients with epilepsy.
