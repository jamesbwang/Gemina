 Pneumocephalus , the presence of air within the cranium , commonly suggests a breach in the meningeal layer or an intracranial infection by a gas-producing organism. Trauma is the most common cause of pneumocephalus , followed by cranial surgery. Other causes include infection and intracranial neoplasm. An 87-year-old man was conveyed to the emergency department after being found to be drowsy by his helper. He was noted to have a new onset right-sided hemiparesis<symptom>. Past medical history was significant for hypertension , stage 5 chronic kidney disease , cerebrovascular accident , pacemaker insertion for sick sinus syndrome<disease><symptom> , transurethral resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> , and pulmonary tuberculosis<disease>. Computed tomography ( CT) of the brain revealed pneumocephalus with air within the dural venous sinuses. A facial bone CT that was performed to look for a fracture demonstrated a minimally displaced fracture of the lateral wall of the right maxillary sinus. There was an acute left middle cerebral artery territory infarct with a hemorrhagic conversion. Despite medical treatment , the patient demised one month after the initial presentation. Pneumocephalus is an uncommon finding , even in trauma. In the event that the clinical presentation can not be explained by the mere presence of air within the cranium , another diagnosis ought to be sought. The delay in finding an alternative diagnosis and its management can be disastrous or even fatal.
