 Teratomas are tumors consisting of two or three germ layers , seen commonly during childhood. Teratomas have been reported to occur in various<disease> sites and organs. Bladder teratoma is a very rare extragonadal tumor , moreover in adults. Although teratomas are known as benign lesions<symptom> in childhood , they may act as malignant tumors when detected during adulthood. This requires total tumor resection , particularly in adult cases , and the addition of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in cases with the potential of malignancy. A very rare case of teratoma of the bladder in a 17-year old Asian girl is presented. The patient had chief complaints of hematuria<symptom>. The diagnosis was made on cystoscopy and confirmed histopathologically. Complete excision was possible. To the authors ' knowledge , this is the first such case reported from Indonesia and the South East Asian region. A bladder teratoma mimics the presentation of a bladder stone , clinically and radiologically. A dermoid cyst<symptom> should be considered as a differential diagnosis , especially when the stone appears to be confined to the bladder wall during examination.
