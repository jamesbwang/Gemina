 This study investigated the effectiveness and underpinning mechanisms of radiosensitization using octaarginine ( R8)- modified gold nanoparticle-poly ( ethylene glycol) ( GNP-PEG-R8) in colorectal cancer cell line LS180 to megavoltage radiotherapy in vitro. In-house synthesized GNP-PEG was characterized by transmission electron microscopy , dynamic light scattering , ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry , and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy was used to quantify internalization. Direct cytotoxicity was established using the Cell Counting Kit-8 , while radiosensitivity was determined using the gold standard in vitro clonogenic assay. Cell-cycle distribution , apoptosis , reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , and mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP) were analyzed by flow cytometry , further exploring the key mechanisms driving GNP-PEG-R8 radiosensitization. The core GNP diameter was 6.3 ± 1.1 nm ( mean ± SD). Following functionalization , the hydrodynamic diameter increased to 19.7 ± 2.8 nm and 27.8 ± 1.8 nm for GNP-PEG and GNP-PEG-R8 , with respective surface plasmon resonance peaks of 515 nm and 525 nm. Furthermore , incorporation of the R8 significantly increased nanoparticle internalization compared to GNP-PEG ( R8-modified GNPs were efficiently internalized by LS180 cells , exhibiting minimal cytotoxicity. This yielded significant radiosensitization in response to megavoltage radiation. GNP-PEG-R8 may enhance radiosensitivity by arresting cell cycle and inducing apoptosis , with elevated ROS identified as the likely initiator.
