 Endovascular management of atherosclerotic infrainguinal arteries recently shifted towards drug eluting devices , designed to locally prevent the restenosis process. Numerous clinical studies report an advantage of drug coated balloons over uncoated balloon angioplasty in treating lower extremity peripheral artery disease. However , as coating and balloon platforms are different , each device requires dedicated clinical evaluations. The aim of the study is to further investigate the safety and effectiveness of a Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon for the treatment of atherosclerotic infrainguinal arteries in a real-world setting. 203 patients out of a final sample of 882 were enrolled in this prospective multicenter , observational , all-comers registry during the first 12 months. The primary endpoints were major adverse events ( defined as procedure or device related death within 30 days post index procedure , clinically-driven target lesion<symptom> revascularization or major target limb amputation) at 6 months and freedom from clinically-driven target lesion<symptom> revascularization at 12 months. Both endpoints were adjudicated by a Clinical Events Committee. Mean patient age was 70.2 ± 10.4 years ( 60.1 % male). 47.3 % of the patients were diabetic and 67.5 % had a history of smoking. Severe claudication was reported in 37.4 % and 40 % had critical limb ischemia. 257 lesions<symptom> , including 13.2 % in the infrapopliteal territory , were treated with Passeo-18 Lux ( mean lesion<symptom> length 75.1 mm ± 69.4 , 20 % occlusions , 76.3 % calcified). At 6 months , the rate of major adverse events was 5.5 % ( 95 % CI 3.1-9.7). Freedom from clinically-driven target lesion<symptom> revascularization at 12 months was 93.2 % ( 95 % CI 89.1-95.8). All causes mortality was 6.5 % ( 95 % CI 3.8-11.0) and overall amputation rate was 4.2 % ( 95 % CI 2.1-8.3) at 12 months. In a real-world environment , the BIOLUX P-III registry preliminary results confirm the safety and efficacy of the Paclitaxel-Coated Passeo-18 Lux balloon as a stand-alone treatment option for atherosclerotic infrainguinal arteries.
