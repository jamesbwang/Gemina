 With the advent of atomically precise synthesis and consequent precise tailoring of their electronic properties , graphene nanoribbons ( GNRs) have emerged as promising building blocks for nanoelectronics. Before being applied as such , it is imperative that their charge transport properties are investigated. Recently , formation of a molecular junction through the controlled attachment of nanoribbons to the probe of a scanning tunneling microscope ( STM) and subsequent lifting allowed for the first conductance measurements. Drawbacks are the perturbation of the intrinsic electronic properties through interaction with the metal surface , as well as the risk of current-induced defect formation which largely restricts the measurements to low bias voltages. Here , we show that resonant transport-essential for device applications-can be measured by lifting electronically decoupled GNRs from an ultrathin layer of NaCl. By varying the applied voltage and tip-sample distance , we can probe resonant transport through frontier orbitals and its dependence on junction length. This technique is used for two distinct types of GNRs: the 7 atom wide armchair GNR and the 3,1-chiral GNR. The features in the conductance maps can be understood and modeled in terms of the intrinsic electronic properties of the ribbons as well as capacitive coupling to tip and substrate. We demonstrate that we can simultaneously measure the current decay with increasing junction length and bias voltage by using a double modulation spectroscopy technique. The strategy described in this work is widely applicable and will lead to a better understanding of electronic transport through molecular junctions in general.
