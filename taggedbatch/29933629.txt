 Oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( ox-LDL) is considered a main biomarker of oxidative stress , a common characteristic in end stage renal disease. We examined the relationship between ox-LDL serum concentrations and cardiovascular disease in permanent hemodiafiltration therapy patients. Ox-LDL values were measured by ELISA and were corrected for LDL-cholesterol ( LDL-C) in 96 participants and in 45 healthy control subjects. We performed chi-square tests and adjusted models for the role of ox-LDL on cardiovascular morbidity including coronary artery disease , left ventricular hypertrophy , systolic , diastolic dysfunction and peripheral arterial disease. ox-LDL/LDL-C values were significantly higher in patients than in control group ( This study showed a significant association between high ox-LDL and systolic cardiac dysfunction in permanent hemodiafiltration therapy patients. This relationship seems to be influenced by aging and pharmaceutical therapy during dialysis sessions , including vitamin D derivatives.
