 This study reports a proof-of concept study to demonstrate the novel approach of phenotyping microbial communities in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ( EBPR) systems using single cell Raman microspectroscopy and link it with phylogentic structures. We uses hierarchical clustering analysis ( HCA) of single-cell Raman spectral fingerprints and intracellular polymers signatures to separate and classify the functionally relevant populations in EBPR systems , namely polyphosphate accumulating organisms ( PAOs) and glycogen accumulating organisms ( GAOs) , as well as other microbial populations. We then investigated the link between Raman-based community phenotyping and 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic characterization of four lab-scale EBPR systems with varying SRTs to gain insights into possible genotype-function relationships. Combined and simultaneous phylogenetic and phenotypic evaluation of EBPR ecosystems revealed SRT-dependent phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics of the PAOs and GAOs , and their association with EBPR performance. The phenotypic diversity and plasticity of PAO populations , which otherwise could not be obtained with phylogenetic analysis alone , showed complex but potentially crucial association with EBPR process stability.
