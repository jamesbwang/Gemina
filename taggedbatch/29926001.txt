 We retrospectively analyzed the factors related to postoperative cardiovascular ( CV) events in patients undergoing partial nephrectomy ( PN) or radical nephrectomy ( RN) for clinical T1 renal cell carcinoma ( RCC). We identified 570 patients who underwent PN or RN for T1 renal cell carcinoma between January 1998 and December 2009 at our institution and related hospitals. We determined the cumulative incidence rate of CV events and overall survival ( OS) using Kaplan-Meier survival curves with a log-rank test , and we evaluated the risk for an increase in CV events and OS using Cox proportional hazard regression. Of the 570 patients , 171 underwent PN and 399 underwent RN. The type of surgery was not significantly related with CV events. The only factor that significantly increased the risk of CV events in both the univariate ( HR 2.67 , p = 0.006) and multivariate analyses ( HR 2.14 , p = 0.044) was a postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) < 45 ml/min/1 .73 m2. Postoperative eGFR was also a significant risk factor for OS in the univariate analysis ( HR 2.38 , p = 0.0104) , but not in the multivariate model. Postoperative renal function was a significant independent predictor of the incidence of subsequent CV events.
