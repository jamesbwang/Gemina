 The mutational patterns of large tandem arrays of short sequence repeats remain largely unknown , despite observations of their high levels of variation in sequence and genomic abundance within and between species. Many factors can influence the dynamics of tandem repeat evolution; however , their evolution has only been examined over a limited phylogenetic sample of taxa. Here , we use publicly available whole-genome sequencing data of 85 haploid mutation accumulation lines derived from six geographically diverse Chlamydomonas reinhardtii isolates to investigate genome-wide mutation rates and patterns in tandem repeats in this species. We find that tandem repeat composition differs among ancestral strains , both in genome-wide abundance and presence/absence of individual repeats. Estimated mutation rates ( repeat copy number expansion and contraction) were high , averaging 4.3 Ã— 10-4 per generation per single unit copy. Although orders of magnitude higher than other types of mutation previously reported in C. reinhardtii , these tandem repeat mutation rates were one order of magnitude lower than what has recently been found in Daphnia pulex , even after correcting for lower overall genome-wide satellite abundance in C. reinhardtii. Most high-abundance repeats were related to others by a single mutational step. Correlations of repeat copy number changes within genomes revealed clusters of closely related repeats that were strongly correlated positively or negatively , and similar patterns of correlation arose independently in two different mutation accumulation experiments. Together , these results paint a dynamic picture of tandem repeat evolution in this unicellular alga.
