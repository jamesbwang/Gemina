 Single ventricle palliation relies on the pulmonary vasculature accommodating non-pulsatile systemic venous return. Mean pulmonary artery pressure ( MPAP) and indexed pulmonary<disease> vascular resistance ( PVRi) are two measures that impact pulmonary blood flow following bidirectional cavopulmonary connection ( BCPC). The purpose of the study was to determine which hemodynamic features are associated with adverse outcomes after BCPC. Pre-operative hemodynamic data and post-operative morbidity and mortality in 250 patients undergoing BCPC at a single center from 2008 to 2014 were reviewed. Patients were then separated into 5 physiologic states based on MPAP , PVRi , and degree of pulmonary<symptom> to systemic blood flow ( Q
