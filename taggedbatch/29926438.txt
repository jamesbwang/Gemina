 The bacterium<pathogen> Haemophilus<pathogen> influenzae<pathogen><disease> type b ( Hib) can cause severe and life-threatening infections such as epiglottitis<disease> and meningitis<disease><symptom>. The course of the disease can be very rapid , resulting in sudden death. The incidence of Hib-induced epiglottitis<disease> in children has declined since the introduction of vaccinations in countries where such vaccinations are routinely administered. We herein present a case involving a 2.5-year-old boy who died suddenly at home. He had developed acute-onset throat<symptom> and abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and a high fever<symptom>. Despite an emergency cricothyrotomy due to a complicated intubation because of a massively swollen epiglottis , the efforts to resuscitate the child were unsuccessful. He was a previously healthy toddler , but he had not yet been vaccinated. Microbiologic analysis revealed the pathogenic bacterium<pathogen> Hib. The main autopsy finding was acute epiglottitis<disease> with swelling and cherry-red coloring of the epiglottis. Postmortem cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid and heart<symptom> blood also revealed Hib as the pathogenic agent. Acute pneumonia<disease> was also diagnosed microscopically. The present report describes a rare case of Hib-induced acute epiglottitis<disease> and presents the key findings of forensic investigations in this type of disease.
