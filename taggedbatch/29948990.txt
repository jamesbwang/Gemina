 This proof-of-concept study explores the feasibility of using a drug-loaded hydrophilic polymeric layer sandwiched between two hydrophobic layers for improving film drug load while achieving sustained release of poorly water-soluble drug. Such films having total thickness in range ~ 146-250 μm were prepared by slurry-based casting using hydrophilic hydroxypropyl methylcellulose ( HPMC) as matrix layer containing fenofibrate ( FNB) as the model drug , encased between two very thin rate-limiting layers of 10 μm each of hydrophobic poly-ɛ-caprolactone ( PCL). Film precursor slurry consisted of HPMC with plasticizer and water along with micronized FNB powders , which were dry-coated with hydrophilic silica. Characterization techniques demonstrated the presence of homogeneously dispersed crystalline FNB in films. The films are very thin and hence two-dimensional; hence , average drug load per unit area in range ~ 5 to ~ 9 mg/cm
