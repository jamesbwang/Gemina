 Intrinsic host susceptibility to viral<disease> infections<disease> plays a major role in determining infection severity in different individuals. In human influenza<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> infections , multiple genetic association studies have identified specific human gene variants that might contribute to enhanced susceptibility or resistance to influenza<pathogen><disease>. Recent studies suggested , the rs12252 T > C polymorphism in the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 ( IFITM3) gene might be associated with susceptibility to severe influenza<pathogen><disease>. However , the studies reported conflicting and inconclusive results. To resolve the controversy , we conducted a systematic meta-analysis to evaluate the role of the IFITM3 rs12252 polymorphism in influenza<pathogen><disease> susceptibility and severity , including twelve studies published before February 19 , 2018 with a total 16,263 subjects ( 1836 influenza<pathogen><disease> cases and 14,427 controls). Odds ratios ( OR) and 95 % confidence intervals were used to assess the strength of the association. Our results indicated increased risk of both severe and mild influenza<pathogen><disease> in subjects carrying the IFITM3 rs12252 polymorphism in the allele contrast C vs. T: OR ( severe) = 1.69 , 95 % CI = 1.23-2.33 , P = 0.001 , and OR ( mild) = 1.46 , 95 % CI = 1.13-1.87 , P = 0.004. Similar results were obtained in the homozygote comparison and dominant model. Stratified analyses by ethnicity revealed increased risk of severe influenza<pathogen><disease> in both the White and East Asian populations , but significant association with mild influenza<pathogen><disease> was found only in the White population. Overall , our meta-analysis suggests a significant association between the IFITM3 rs12252 polymorphism and the risk of influenza<pathogen><disease> in both the White and East Asian populations.
