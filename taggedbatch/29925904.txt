 Myeloma bone disease is a devastating complication of multiple myeloma ( MM) and is caused by dysregulation of bone remodeling processes in the bone<disease> marrow microenvironment. Previous studies showed that microRNA-138 ( miR-138) is a negative regulator of osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs) and that inhibiting its function enhances bone formation in vitro. In this study , we explored the role of miR-138 in myeloma bone disease and evaluated the potential of systemically delivered locked nucleic acid ( LNA)- modified anti-miR-138 oligonucleotides in suppressing myeloma bone disease. We showed that expression of miR-138 was significantly increased in MSCs from MM patients ( MM-MSCs) and myeloma cells compared to those from healthy subjects. Furthermore , inhibition of miR-138 resulted in enhanced osteogenic differentiation of MM-MSCs in vitro and increased the number of endosteal osteoblastic lineage cells ( OBCs) and bone formation rate in mouse models of myeloma bone disease. RNA sequencing of the OBCs identified TRPS1 and SULF2 as potential miR-138 targets that were de-repressed in anti-miR-138-treated mice. In summary , these data indicate that inhibition of miR-138 enhances bone formation in MM and that pharmacological inhibition of miR-138 could represent a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of myeloma bone disease.
