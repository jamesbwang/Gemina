 Individuals with recent/acute HIV-infection have an increased likelihood of disease transmission. To evaluate effectiveness of identifying recent infections , we compared networks of recently and long-term HIV-infected individuals. The Transmission Reduction Intervention Project included two separate arms of recruitment , networks of recently HIV-infected individuals and networks of long-term HIV-infected individuals. Networks of each were recruited and tested for HIV<pathogen> and syphilis<disease> infection. The per-seed yield ratios of recruitment were compared between arms. Overall , 84 ( 41.6 %) of 202 participants were identified as HIV-positive. HIV<pathogen> prevalence was higher ( p < 0.001) among networks of recent seeds ( 33/96 , 34.4 %) compared to long-term seeds ( 6/31 , 19.4 %). More individuals were identified with active syphilis<disease> infection ( p = 0.007) among networks of recent seeds ( 15/96 , 15.6 %) , compared to networks of long-term seeds ( 3/31 , 9.7 %). Network-based recruitment of recently HIV-infected individuals was more effective at identifying HIV<pathogen> and syphilis<disease> infection. Allocation of public health resources may be improved by targeting interventions toward networks of recently HIV-infected individuals.
