 The incidence of cardiogenic shock<symptom> is rising , patient complexity is increasing and patient survival has plateaued. Mirroring organisational innovations of elite military units , our multidisciplinary medical specialists at the INOVA Heart and Vascular Institute aim to combine the adaptability , agility and cohesion of small teams across our large healthcare system. We advocate for widespread adoption of our ` combat ' methodology focused on: increased disease awareness , early multidisciplinary shock<symptom> team activation , group decision-making , rapid initiation of mechanical circulatory support ( as appropriate) , haemodynamic-guided management , strict protocol adherence , complete data capture and regular after action reviews , with a goal of ending preventable death from cardiogenic shock<symptom>.
