 The past decade has seen a remarkable surge in studies of thin-film and single-molecule electronics , due in no small part to the development and advancement of experimental methods for the construction and measurement of metal | molecule | metal junctions. Within the plethora of molecular structures that have been investigated , metal complexes of general form trans-M ( C ( triple bond , length as m-dash) CR) 2 ( Ln) have attracted attention from the inorganic and organometallic chemistry community in the search for efficient molecular wires due to the potential π-d-π orbital mixing along the molecular backbone. In this article progress towards this goal will be summarised , and design strategies for future molecular components discussed.
