 Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV) induces latent life-long infections in all human populations. Between 30 to nearly 100 % of individuals are affected depending on geographic area and socio-economic conditions. The biology of this virus is difficult to explore due to its extreme sophistication and the lack of pertinent animal model. Here we present the first application of the ANCHOR DNA labeling system to a herpes<disease> virus , enabling real time imaging and direct monitoring of HCMV infection and replication in living human cells. The ANCHOR system is composed of a protein ( OR) which specifically binds to a short , non-repetitive DNA target sequence ( ANCH) and spreads onto neighboring sequences by protein oligomerization. When OR protein is fused to GFP , its accumulation results in a site specific fluorescent focus. We have created a recombinant ANCHOR- HCMV harboring an ANCH target sequence and the gene encoding the cognate OR-GFP fusion protein. Infection of permissive cells with ANCHOR-HCMV enables visualization of nearly the complete viral cycle until cell fragmentation and death. Quantitative analysis of infection kinetics and of viral DNA replication revealed cell-type specific HCMV behavior and sensitivity to inhibitors. Our results show that the ANCHOR technology provides an efficient tool for the study of complex DNA viruses and a new highly promising system for the development of innovative biotechnology applications.
