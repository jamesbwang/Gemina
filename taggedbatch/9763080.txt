 The objective of the current study was to develop an Urdu version of the International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS-U) and validate it for Pakistani patients suffering from lower urinary<disease> tract symptoms ( LUTS). IPSS-U was developed by a two-step forward and back translation and to evaluate its psychometric properties , a prospective study involving patients suffering from LUTS ( n = 267) was conducted at Outpatient Urology Department , Mayo Hospital , Lahore , Pakistan. Internal consistency and reproducibility were assessed using Cronbach 's alpha and the Intra-Class Correlation Coefficient ( ICC). Moreover , exploratory , and confirmatory factor analyses were performed to determine dimensionality of IPSS-U items. Overall reliability of IPSS-U was satisfactory ( Cronbach 's alpha = 0.72 , ICC of symptom questions = 0.92 and ICC of QOL index = 0.75). Exploratory factor analysis revealed that two factors were consistent , which together explained 59.8 % of the variance. IPSS-U items 1 , 3 , 5 and 6 were components of the first factor whereas item 2 , 4 and 7 were components of the second factor. All the items loaded high on their factors and there were no cross loadings. Moreover , confirmatory factor analysis also showed two-factor model , with acceptable fitting patterns. IPSS-U is a valid and reliable non-gender specific instrument to assess the frequency and severity of LUTS in Urdu-speaking population.
