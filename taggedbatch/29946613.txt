 A fascinating Fe-promoted protocol for the synthesis of N-arylsulfonamides has been developed. Starting from commercially available nitroarenes and sulfonyl chlorides , moderate<symptom> to excellent yields of the corresponding N-arylsulfonamides can be obtained. In particular , Fe dust serves as the sole reductant in the transformation and it can be easily performed on a large scale.
