 Dietary deoxynivalenol ( DON) impairs the intestinal functions and performance in broiler chickens , whereas little is known about the effect of DON on the gastrointestinal microbiota. This study evaluated the impact of graded levels of dietary DON contamination on the cecal bacterial microbiota , their predicted metabolic abilities and short-chain fatty acid ( SCFA) profiles in chickens. In using a single oral lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) challenge we further assessed whether an additional intestinal stressor would potentiate DON-related effects on the cecal microbiota. Eighty 1-day-old chicks were fed diets with increasing DON concentrations ( 0 , 2.5 , 5 , and 10 mg DON per kg diet) for 5 weeks and were sampled after half of the chickens received an oral LPS challenge ( 1 mg LPS/kg bodyweight) 1 day before sampling. The bacterial composition was investigated by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the V3-5 region of the 16S rRNA gene. DON-feeding decreased (
