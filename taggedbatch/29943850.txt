 The present work reports the beneficial effects of using a microplatform on the development of mouse single blastomeres ( SBs) to the blastocyst stage. Development of blastocysts from SBs separated from two- and four-cell stage embryos ( two- and four-cell SBs) can provide a valuable supply both for couples who use fertility-assisted techniques and farm animals. As a step forward , we introduce three chips that provide the possibility of culturing SBs separately , in groups , and in the vicinity of the intact embryo ( co-culture) , while each well of the chips is assigned to an isolated SB. Two- and four-cell SBs co-cultured with intact embryos showed 97.1 % and 76.6 % developmental rates and up to 34.1 % and 49.1 % growth relative to the microdroplet method ( control). We examined the quality of developed blastocysts by assessing the total cell number , the number of inner cell mass ( ICM) according to the octamer-binding transcription factor 4 marker ( OCT4) , and trophectoderm ( TE). Co-culture of SBs with an intact embryo in a chip with nanoscale culture medium volume also increased the cell population of the developed embryo. The ICM: TE ratio , which is the most important blastocyst quality parameter , also indicated that developed two-cell SBs have a higher degree of similarity to intact embryos despite fewer numbers of total cells.
