 Mitochondrial β-barrel proteins are encoded in the nucleus , translated by cytosolic ribosomes , and then imported into the organelle. Recently , a detailed understanding of the intramitochondrial import pathway of β-barrel proteins was obtained. In contrast , it is still completely unclear how newly synthesized β-barrel proteins reach the mitochondrial surface in an import-competent conformation. In this study , we show that cytosolic Hsp70 chaperones and their Hsp40 cochaperones Ydj1 and Sis1 interact with newly synthesized β-barrel proteins. These interactions are highly relevant for proper biogenesis , as inhibiting the activity of the cytosolic Hsp70 , preventing its docking to the mitochondrial receptor Tom70 , or depleting both Ydj1 and Sis1 resulted in a significant reduction in the import of such substrates into mitochondria. Further experiments demonstrate that the interactions between β-barrel proteins and Hsp70 chaperones and their importance are conserved also in mammalian cells. Collectively , this study outlines a novel mechanism in the early events of the biogenesis of mitochondrial outer membrane β-barrel proteins.
