 2 '- Fucosyllactose ( 2 '- FL) is one of the most important human milk oligosaccharides and has several health benefits for infants. The levels of 2 '- FL in breast milk or samples from other sources can be quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. However , this method can not be used for simultaneous detection of the target compound in numerous samples. Here , we developed a simple method for quantifying 2 '- FL in a microplate format. The method involves two steps: ( 1) release of L-fucose from 2 '- FL by Î±- ( 1-2,3,4,6)- L-fucosidase and ( 2) measurement of NADPH formed during oxidation of L-fucose by L-fucose dehydrogenase. This method enables measurement of up to 5 g/L2 '- FL in 50 min using a 96-well microplate. The efficiency and simplicity of the proposed method makes it suitable for the analyses of a large number of samples simultaneously.
