 In recent years , a constant increase of vector-borne diseases has been seen in Italy , due to various conditions including climate change , trade and international travel. These factors contribute to the diffusion on the Italian territory of newly introduced carriers and pathogens. These new pathogens can be an emerging cause of epidemics , as in the case of the Chikungunya<pathogen> virus<pathogen> in 2007 and in 2017 , or can establish a true endemic disease , as in the case of the West<pathogen><disease> Nile<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen>. It is even possible that diseases that had been endemic in the past , which were subsequently eliminated in Italy , could be reintroduced , as in the case of malaria<disease>. This review aims to illustrate the recent evolution of the diffusion of vectors and of the pathogens they convey , and to investigate which emerging pathogens could be responsible in the immediate future for new epidemics/ endemics in Italy. Nowadays it is necessary to keep those neglected emerging diseases in mind , in order to establish a correct diagnostic-therapeutic approach at the individual level , and to identify the measures to avoid their diffusion at the community level. Preventive interventions , such as available vaccines or individual protection from vectors , are also discussed.
