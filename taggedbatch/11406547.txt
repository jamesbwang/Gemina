 CD19 is a transmembrane glycoprotein of immunoglobulin superfamily. In order to treat lymphoma , monoclonal antibodies ( mAb) can target different antigens , including CD19 , CD20 and CD22 on the surface of B-cells. Along with biotechnology progress , a new generation of antibodies is introduced , with the purpose of eliminating the defects of the previous generation. Among the most developed one are nanobodies ( Nb). Nbs are a unique kind of camelid single domain antibody fragments with a broad range of medical applications. Unique physicochemical properties of Nbs have made them ideal candidates for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. An immune gene library was created , and several CD19 specific Nbs were selected through antigen panning process , and their molecular properties as well as specificity , sensitivity , affinity and immunoreactivity against CD19 positive and negative cells were evaluated. The Nb library was prepared with 7.2 x107 members. We managed to isolate a panel of CD19-specific Nbs after the last round of selection with the affinity of isolated Nbs being estimated at the standard range of 15-35 nM. Sequence analysis of positive clones was indicative of the fact that 12 variable sequences were confirmed. Of all these 12 clones , 2 clones with the greatest level signal in ELISA underwent subsequent analysis. Our sequencing results indicated high sequence homology ( approximately 90 %) between the Nb and Homa variable immunoglobulin domains. Specific Nbs possess the potential to be used as novel therapeutic approaches in order to treat autoimmune diseases and B-cell lymphoma.
