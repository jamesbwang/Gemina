 During infection , the host restrains Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> ( Mtb) from proliferating by imposing an arsenal of stresses. Despite this onslaught of attacks , Mtb is able to persist for the lifetime of the host , indicating that this pathogen has substantial molecular mechanisms to resist host-inflicted damage. The stringent response is a conserved global stress response in bacteria that involves the production of the hyperphosphorylated guanine nucleotides ppGpp and pppGpp ( collectively called ( p) ppGpp). ( p) ppGpp then regulates a number of cellular processes to adjust the physiology of the bacteria to promote survival in different environments. Survival in the presence of host-generated stresses is an essential quality of successful pathogens , and the stringent response is critical for the intracellular survival of a number of pathogenic bacteria. In addition , the stringent response has been linked to virulence gene expression , persistence , latency and drug tolerance. In Mtb , ( p) ppGpp synthesis is required for survival in low nutrient conditions , long term culture and during chronic<disease> infection<disease> in animal models , all indicative of a strict requirement for ( p) ppGpp during exposure to stresses associated with infection. In this review we discuss ( p) ppGpp metabolism and how this functions as a critical regulator of Mtb virulence.
