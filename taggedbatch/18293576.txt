 The accurate calculation of doses during external radiotherapy sessions is necessary. Recently , the models used for this purpose have been the point kernel , pencil-beam , and collapsed cone superposition/convolution combination models. In this study , it is aimed to determine point/pencil-beam kernels to be used in dose calculations. For this purpose , tallying pencil-beam fluence based on Monte Carlo ( MC) simulations is investigated by scoring a volume of interest centered in a cubic water phantom at a depth of 10 cm and the irradiated field of 10 cm Ã— 10 cm. The fluence is calculated for each mono-energetic photon ranging from 0.25-6 MV at increments of 250 keV. The output of the four fluence kernels along the depth Z around the central axis is categorized for both the primary and secondary photons and electrons. Here , a database for pencil-beam kernels is established for each category. For validation purposes , other MC simulations are carried out for fluence calculations as produced by the predetermined poly-energetic spectra for a Varian 6 MV linear accelerator. The net results show a good fit of the two convoluted fluence spectra quantities for both mono-energetic and poly-energetics-based simulations except little singular peaks.
