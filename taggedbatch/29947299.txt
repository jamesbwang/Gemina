 The success of non-operative reduction methods is extremely high in pediatric intussusceptions. Recurrent intussusceptions are also well-known entities in the pediatric age group after non-operative and operative reduction. Historical recommendations include a 24- to 48-h observation period after reduction. This situation often leads to unnecessary time loss. We aimed to show that early discharge does not pose a significant risk. The medical records of patients who presented to our hospital between January 2008 and June 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Data collected included age , clinical presentation , procedural information , surgical intervention , hospital stay , and presence of recurrence. A total of 62 patients were included the study. Non-operative reduction was successful in 58 of 62 patients ( 93.5 %). Four patients with failed non-operative reduction underwent subsequent surgical procedures. All patients were allowed oral intake within 2-4 h ( mean: 2.6 h) after successful non-operative reduction and discharged within 5-8 h ( mean: 6.2 h) after reduction. There were five episodes of recurrence and none occurred in the first 48 h after reduction. All recurrences were treated with non-operative reduction as in the first attempt. There were no problems detected in short- or long-term follow-ups. Pneumatic reduction is a safe and effective method in pediatric intussusception. If one is confident about treatment success , patients can be discharged without a long observation period. Early discharge is also cost-effective and reduces time loss.
