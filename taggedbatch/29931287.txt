 The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate the effects of augmentative and alternative communication ( AAC) interventions that included aided AAC input ( e.g. , aided AAC modeling , aided language modeling , aided language stimulation , augmented input) on communicative outcomes ( both comprehension and expression) for individuals with developmental disabilities who use AAC. A systematic search resulted in the identification of 26 single-case experimental designs ( 88 participants) and 2 group experimental designs ( 103 participants). Studies were coded in terms of participants , intervention characteristics , dependent variables , outcomes , and quality of evidence. AAC interventions that included aided AAC input in isolation , or as part of a multicomponent intervention , were found to be highly effective across participants of various ages , disabilities , and language skills. The interventions typically included aided AAC input in conjunction with expectant delay , direct prompting ( e.g. , spoken , gestural) , contingent responding , and open-ended questions. The interventions were found to be highly effective in supporting both comprehension and expression across the domains of pragmatics , semantics , and morphosyntax. Outcomes related to expression were reported more often than outcomes related to comprehension. Aided AAC input may reduce input-output asymmetry and enhance expression and comprehension for individuals who use AAC; the evidence suggests that partners should utilize this strategy. Future research is needed to investigate the effects of AAC input ( aided and unaided) on long-term language development for individuals who require AAC. https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.6394364.
