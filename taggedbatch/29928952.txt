 Although there is a growing interest in using music to improve movement performance in various populations , there remains a need to better understand how music influences motor cortical activity. Listening to music is tightly linked to neural processes within the motor cortex and can modulate motor cortical activity in healthy young adult ( HYAs). There is limited evidence regarding how moving to music modulates motor cortical activity. Thus , the purpose of this study was to explore the influence of moving to music on motor cortical activity in HYAs. Electroencephalography was collected while 32 HYAs tapped their index finger in time with a tone and with two contrasting music styles. Two movement rates were presented for each condition. Power spectra were obtained from data collected over the primary sensorimotor region and supplemental motor area and were compared between conditions. Results revealed a significant difference between both music conditions and the tone only condition for both the regions. For both music styles , power was increased in the beta band for low movement rates and increased in the alpha band for high movement rates. A secondary analysis determining the effect of music experience on motor cortical activity revealed a significant difference between musicians and non-musicians. Power in the beta band was increased across all conditions. The results of this study provide the initial step towards a more complete understanding of the neurophysiological underpinnings of music on movement performance which may inform future studies and therapeutic strategies.
