 A scientifically sound validated foot and ankle specific score validated ab initio for different languages is missing. The aim of a project of the European Foot and Ankle Society ( EFAS) was to develop , validate , and publish a new score ( the EFAS-Score) for different European languages. The EFAS Score was developed and validated in three stages: ( 1) item ( question) identification , ( 2) item reduction and scale exploration , ( 3) confirmatory analyses and responsiveness. The following score specifications were chosen: scale/subscale ( Likert 0-4) , questionnaire based , outcome measure , patient related outcome measurement. For stage 3 , data were collected pre-operatively and at a minimum follow-up of 3 months and mean follow-up of 6 months. Item reduction , scale exploration , confirmatory analyses and responsiveness were executed using analyses from classical test theory and item response theory. Stage 1 resulted in 31 general and 7 sports related questions. In stage 2 , a 6-item general EFAS Score was constructed using English , German , French and Swedish language data. In stage 3 , internal consistency of the scale was confirmed in seven languages: the original four languages , plus Dutch , Italian and Polish ( Cronbach 's Alpha > 0.86 in all language versions). Responsiveness was good , with moderate<symptom> to large effect sizes in all languages , and significant positive association between the EFAS Score and patient-reported improvement. No sound<symptom> EFAS Sports Score could be constructed. The multi-language EFAS Score was successfully validated in the orthopaedic ankle and foot surgery patient population , including a wide variety of foot and ankle pathologies.
