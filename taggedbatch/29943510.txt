 Cellulosome is a highly efficient supramolecular machine for lignocellulose degradation , and its substrate-coupled regulation requires soluble transmembrane signals. However , the inducers for cellulosome synthesis and the inducing effect have not been clarified quantitatively. Values of cellulosome production capacity ( CPC) and estimated specific activity ( eSA) were calculated based on the primary scaffoldin ScaA to define the stimulating effects on the cellulosome synthesis in terms of quantity and quality respectively. The estimated cellulosome production of Clostridium<pathogen> thermocellum on glucose was at a low housekeeping level. Both Avicel and cellobiose increased CPCs of the cells instead of the eSAs of the cellulosome. The CPC of Avicel-grown cells was over 20-fold of that of glucose-grown cells , while both Avicel- and glucose-derived cellulosomes showed similar eSA. The CPC of cellobiose-grown cells was also over three times higher than glucose-grown cells , but the eSA of cellobiose-derived cellulosome was 16 % lower than that of the glucose-derived cellulosome. Our results indicated that cello-oligosaccharides played the key roles in inducing the synthesis of the cellulosome , but non-cellulosic polysaccharides showed no inducing effects.
