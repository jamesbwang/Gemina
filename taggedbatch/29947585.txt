 For the past decade , research on the storage limitations of working memory has been dominated by two fundamentally different hypotheses. On the one hand , the contents of working memory may be stored in a limited number of ` slots ' , each with a fixed resolution. On the other hand , any number of items may be stored , but with decreasing resolution. These two hypotheses have been invaluable in characterizing the computational structure of working memory , but neither provides a complete account of the available experimental data , nor speaks to the neural basis of the limitations it characterizes. To address these shortcomings , we simulated a multiple-item working memory task with a cortical network model , the cellular resolution of which allowed us to quantify the coding fidelity of memoranda as a function of memory load , as measured by the discriminability , regularity and reliability of simulated neural spiking. Our simulations account for a wealth of neural and behavioural data from human and non-human primate studies , and they demonstrate that feedback inhibition lowers both capacity and coding fidelity. Because the strength of inhibition scales with the number of items stored by the network , increasing this number progressively lowers fidelity until capacity is reached. Crucially , the model makes specific , testable predictions for neural activity on multiple-item working memory tasks.
