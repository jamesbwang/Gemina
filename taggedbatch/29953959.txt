 The aim of this work was to assess the effects of manganese ( Mn) toxicity on the proteome of tomato roots using two proteomic approaches , shotgun and two-dimensional electrophoresis. The shotgun approach yielded 367 reliable proteins , whereas the 2-DE approach detected 340 consistent spots. The 2-DE method found 54 proteins changing in relative abundance in the excess Mn treatment , whereas the shotgun detected changes in 118 proteins. Only 7 % of the differential proteins were found by both methods , illustrating their complementary nature. Metabolic pathways most affected were protein metabolism , oxido-reductases and signaling. Results support that Mn toxicity alters the protein turnover and impairs energy production in roots , leading to changes in glycolysis , pyruvate metabolism , TCA and oxidative phosphorylation. Excess Mn also induced changes in peroxidases and hydrolases participating in cell wall lignification and suberization and activated plant defense mechanisms , with changes occurring via pathogenesis-related proteins as well as peroxidases. Finally , Mn toxicity elicited regulatory mechanisms and affected the abundance of root nutrient reservoir proteins. The overall analysis of the differential root proteome upon Mn toxicity suggests a general slowdown of metabolic activities , especially energy production , cell wall integrity and protein turnover , which occurs in parallel with increases in stress related proteins.
