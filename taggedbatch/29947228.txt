 Near-field communication ( NFC) labeling technology has been recently used to endow smartphones with nonline-of-sight sensing functions to improve the environment , human health , and quality of life. For applications in detecting food spoilage , the development of a sensor with high enough sensitivity to act as a switch for an NFC tag remains a challenge. In this Letter , we developed a nanostructured conductive polymer-based gas sensor with high sensitivity of Î” R/ R
