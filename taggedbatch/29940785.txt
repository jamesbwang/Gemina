 Mutations in the genes necessary for the structure and function of vertebrate photoreceptor cells are associated with multiple forms of inherited retinal degeneration. Mutations in the gene encoding RHO ( rhodopsin) are a common cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa ( adRP) , with the Pro23His variant of RHO resulting in a misfolded protein that activates endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response. Stimulating macroautophagy/autophagy has been proposed as a strategy for clearing misfolded RHO and reducing photoreceptor death. We found that retinas from mice heterozygous for the gene encoding the RHO
