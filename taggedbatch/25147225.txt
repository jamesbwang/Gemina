 To investigate the role of autophagy in advanced glycation end products ( AGEs)- induced proliferation and migration in rat vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs). After culture , VSMCs were treated with 0 , 1 , 10 , and 100 μg/ml concentrations of AGEs. Autophagy specific protein light chain 3 ( LC3)- I/II was determined by western blotting , autophagosomes were observed with electron microscopy , cell proliferation was quantified using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ( MTT) assay , and cell migration was evaluated using Transwell migration and scratch assays. Compared to the control group , the level of LC3- II/I in AGEs treatment group was up-regulated , and the number of autophagosomes was also increased. Furthermore , in concentration of 100 μg/ml AGEs , the extent of proliferation and migration was significantly increased compared to the control group. However , pretreating cells with autophagy inhibitor 3-MA could attenuate these effects. Our study demonstrated that AGEs-induced autophagy accelerated AGEs-stimulated proliferation and migration in VSMCs.
