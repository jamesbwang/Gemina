 Recently , definitive chemoradiotherapy ( dCRT) has become one of the essential treatment strategies for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC) and has been especially gaining prevalence for cervical ESCC to preserve the larynx. Our department recently introduced dCRT concomitant with docetaxel , cisplatin , and 5-fluorouracil ( DCF-R) for treating advanced cervical ESCC. This study aims to assess the safety and outcomes of DCF-R in patients with advanced cervical ESCC. We retrospectively assessed 11 patients with advanced cervical ESCC ( clinical stage: II-IV , including T4b and/or M1 lymph node) who received DCF-R as the first-line treatment between December 2010 and February 2015. Our patient cohort comprised 8 males and 3 females ( median age 68 years; range 54-76 years). The pretreatment clinical stage included stage II ( 1) , stage III ( 7) , and stage IV ( 3) cases ( including 3 patients with T4b ( 2 trachea and 1 thyroid) and 3 patients with M1 lymph node). We attained complete response ( CR) in 10 patients and stable disease in 1 patient. Of 10 patients with CR , 5 experienced recurrence and 5 continued exhibiting CR. Furthermore , grade 3 or more adverse events included leucopenia ( 91 %) , neutropenia ( 91 %) , febrile neutropenia ( 45 %) , and pharyngeal<symptom> pain<symptom> ( 55 %). While the 2-year overall survival rate was 72 % , the 2-year recurrent-free survival rate was 64 % , respectively. DCF-R treatment for advanced cervical esophageal cancer could be completed by the careful administration; although a strong blood toxicity might occur , this treatment may provide the chance to obtain favorable prognosis with larynx preservation.
