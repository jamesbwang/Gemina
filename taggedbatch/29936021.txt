 In a recent commentary , Schulte et al. ( 2017) argued that addictive-like eating should be conceptualized as a substance use disorder rather than a behavioural addiction , and noted that many parallels that Hebebrand et al. ( 2014) drew between addictive-like eating and behavioural addictions apply likewise to substance use disorders. However , we argue that many of the arguments advanced by Schulte et al. ( 2017) in support of a substance-based food addiction model , including the important role played by ingested substances , are nonspecific. That is , these arguments apply equally well to behavioural addictions and other mental disorders , notably eating disorders , which raises the question of whether the phenomenon of addictive-like eating is encompassed by existing eating disorder diagnoses. Similarities between addictive-like eating and substance use , no matter how compelling , do not ensure the validity or clinical utility of a substance-based food addiction model and should not drive the conceptualization of addictive-like eating. The present commentary discusses problems with Schulte et al. 's ( 2017) arguments for substance-based food addiction , and draws attention to alternative conceptualizations of addictive-like eating which risk being overlooked when this conversation is framed as a dichotomous debate between the food and eating addiction models.
