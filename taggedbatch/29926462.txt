 Single nucleic acid molecules form hairpins that may stabilize secondary and tertiary structures as well as perform enzymatic and other chemical functions. Considerable progress has been made in the effort to understand the contributions of various factors to the stability of a given hairpin sequence. For a given sequence , it is possible to compute both the most likely structural arrangements and their associated free energies over a range of experimental conditions. However , there are many observed hairpin irregularities for which the energies and function are not well understood. Here we examine the irregular RNA Transactivation Response ( TAR) hairpin from the HIV-1 genome. Using single molecule optical tweezers , the hairpin is force unfolded , revealing the overall unfolding free energy and the character of the transition state. These measurements allow the construction of a simple energy landscape from unfolding measurements , which can be directly compared to a theoretical landscape. This method is easily adapted to other structures , including the effects of noncanonical bases and even ligand binding.
