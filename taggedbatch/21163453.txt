 Increased aortic stiffness is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease. Optimal measurement is highly beneficial for the detection of atherosclerosis and the management of patients at risk. Thus , it was our purpose to selectively measure aortic stiffness using a novel imaging method and to provide reference values from a population-based study. One hundred twenty six inhabitants of Freiburg , Germany , between 20 and 80 years prospectively underwent 3 Tesla cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR) of the thoracic aorta. 4D flow CMR ( spatial/temporal resolution 2 mm PWV increased from 4.93 ± 0.54 m/s in 20-30 year-old to 8.06 ± 1.03 m/s in 70-80 year-old subjects. PWV was significantly lower in women compared to men ( p < 0.0001). Increased blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( systolic r = 0.36 , p < 0.0001; diastolic r = 0.33 , p = 0.0001; mean arterial pressure r = 0.37 , p < 0.0001) correlated with PWV after adjustment for age and gender. Finally , PWV increased with increasing diameter of the aorta ( ascending aorta r = 0.20 , p = 0.026; aortic arch r = 0.24 , p = 0.009; descending aorta r = 0.26 , p = 0.004). Correlation of PWV and DC of the AAo and DAo or the mean of both was high ( r = 0.69 , r = 0.68 , r = 0.73; p < 0.001). 4D flow CMR was successfully applied to calculate aortic PWV and thus aortic stiffness. Findings showed a high correlation with distensibility coefficients representing local compliance of the aorta. Our novel method and reference data for PWV may provide a reliable biomarker for the identification of patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and optimal guidance of future treatment in studies or clinical routine.
