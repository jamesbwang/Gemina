 Immunoglobulin G ( IgG) replacement therapy is a standard treatment for patients with primary immunodeficiency<disease> diseases<disease> ( PIDs). Hizentra ® , a 20 % human subcutaneous IgG ( SCIG) , is approved for biweekly administration for PIDs. The aim of the multicenter IBIS study was to prospectively investigate the efficacy of biweekly Hizentra ® compared with previous IVIG or SCIG treatment regimens in patients with PIDs. The study consisted of a 12-month retrospective period followed by 12-month prospective observational period. The main endpoints included pre-infusion IgG concentrations , proportion of patients with serious bacterial infections ( SBIs) , other infections , hospitalizations due to PID-related illnesses , and days with antibiotics during the study periods. Of the 36 patients enrolled in the study , 35 patients continued the study ( mean age 26.1 ± 14.4 years; 68.6 % male). The mean pre-infusion IgG levels for prior immunoglobulin regimens during the retrospective period ( 7.84 ± 2.09 g/L) and the prospective period ( 8.55 ± 1.76 g/L) did not show any significant variations ( p = 0.4964). The mean annual rate of SBIs/patient was 0.063 ± 0.246 for both prospective and retrospective periods. No hospitalizations related to PIDs were reported during the prospective period versus one in the retrospective period. All patients were either very ( 76.5 %) or quite ( 23.5 %) satisfied with biweekly Hizentra ® at the end of the study. In conclusion , the IBIS study provided real-world evidence on the efficacy of biweekly Hizentra ® in patients with PIDs , thus verifying the data generated by the pharmacometric modeling and simulation study in a normal clinical setting.
