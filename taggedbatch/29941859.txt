 Viscosity-enhancing agents ( VEA) have been widely employed in high flowability cement-based materials , so as to ensure that no bleeding and segregation would occur. However , in most cases , interaction between VEA and superplasticizer would be unavoidable. In this study , the effect of polyacrylic acid ( PAA) , known as one of the most commonly used VEAs , on rheology performance of cement paste containing polycarboxylate superplasticizer ( PCE) , was studied. The initial fluidity was assessed with mini slump , and rheological behavior of cement paste was evaluated with rotor rheometer. Adsorption amount was examined with total organic carbon ( TOC) analyzer , and the zeta potential was also tested. The interaction between PAA and PCE in the presence of calcium ion ( Ca
