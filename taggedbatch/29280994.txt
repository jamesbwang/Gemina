 Moso bamboo ( Phyllostachys edulis) is a well-known bamboo species of high economic value in the textile industry due to its rapid growth. Phytohormones , which are master regulators of growth and development , serve as important endogenous signals. However , the mechanisms through which phytohormones regulate growth in moso bamboo remain unknown to date. Here , we reported that exogenous gibberellins ( GA) applications resulted in a significantly increased internode length and lignin condensation. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that photosynthesis-related genes were enriched in the GA-repressed gene class , which was consistent with the decrease in leaf chlorophyll concentrations and the lower rate of photosynthesis following GA treatment. Exogenous GA applications on seedlings are relatively easy to perform , thus we used 4-week-old whole seedlings of bamboo for GA- treatment followed by high throughput sequencing. In this study , we identified 932 cis-nature antisense transcripts ( cis-NATs) , and 22,196 alternative splicing ( AS) events in total. Among them , 42 cis-nature antisense transcripts ( cis-NATs) and 442 AS events were differentially expressed upon exposure to exogenous GA This study provides novel insights illustrating how GA alters post-transcriptional regulation and will shed light on the underlying mechanism of growth modulated by GA in moso bamboo.
