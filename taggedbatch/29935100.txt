 Fatty liver disease is an important complication associated with liver transplantation , and the cytochrome P-450 system of the donor liver may be involved in its pathogenesis. To explore the effects of the CYP27A1 , CYP27B1 , CYP2R1 , and vitamin D receptor pathways on vitamin D maintenance after living donor liver transplantation , we investigated the interplay between serum 25 ( OH) D<pathogen> and common variants in 60 paired donors and recipients who underwent living donor liver transplantation. We prospectively collected 60 donor/recipient pairs from our liver transplantation programmes and extracted serum DNA to evaluate single nucleotide polymorphisms in CYP27A1 rs4674344 , CYP27B1 rs10877012 , CYP2R1 rs10741657 , and VDR rs2228530 alleles using real-time polymerase chain reaction. We measured serum 25 ( OH) D<pathogen> concentrations of donors ( D-D0) and recipients before ( R-D0) and after ( R-D30) living donor liver transplantation for comparison with repeated-measures analysis of variance in generalized estimating equations analysis. Fatty liver disease was noted in 28.3 % of the cases after living donor liver transplantation , and the graft rejection rate was 25 %. There were significant differences in low serum 25 ( OH) D<pathogen> concentrations between D-D0 and R-D0 and between R-D0 and R-30 groups. Significant associations were observed for serum CYP27A1 rs4674344 in recipients and donors as well as for graft liver tissue with VDR rs2228530. There was no significant relationship with serum CYP27B1 rs10877012 in recipients and donors or with graft liver tissue with CYP2R1 rs10741657. Donor/recipient CYP27A1 rs4674344 and graft VDR rs2228570 may be related to low serum 25 ( OH) D<pathogen> and may play a major role in the development of fatty liver disease in recipients after living donor liver transplantation.
