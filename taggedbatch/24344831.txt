 To explore the equity in health services in the rural areas , by studying the rural residents in two counties of Ningbo City , Zhejiang. Multi-stage stratified cluster random sampling method was performed to draw the study sample. Trained investigators conducted face to face interviews using a questionnaire. Rural residents were stratified into 5 income groups. Centralized index ( CI) and risk ratios ( RR) were used to assess the equity in health services and the impact of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme ( NCMS). The centralized index of the 2 weeks prevalence , two-week visiting rate and chronic<disease> disease<disease> prevalence among different income groups was- 0.0264 ,- 0.0076 and- 0.0160 , respectively , while that of the hospitalization rate was 0.0006. The highest NCMS coverage rate , adjusted risk of disease and catastrophic health expenditure ( CHE) rates were observed in lowest income groups ( 92.86 , 4.94 and 32.21 % , respectively. Two-week prevalence , chronic<disease> diseases<disease> prevalence and RR showed a declining trend with increasing income levels. NCMS has improved the service availability and reduced the economic burden of diseases. However , its impact on reducing the economic risk of illness and promoting equity in health services has not been significant.
