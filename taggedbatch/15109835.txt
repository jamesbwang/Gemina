 Heterogeneous hydrogels with desired matrix complexity are studied for a variety of biomimetic materials. Despite the range of such microstructured materials described , few methods permit independent control over microstructure and microscale mechanics by precisely controlled , single-step processing methods. Here , a phototriggered crosslinking methodology that traps microstructures in liquid-liquid phase-separated solutions of a highly elastomeric resilin-like polypeptide ( RLP) and poly ( ethylene glycol) ( PEG) is reported. RLP-rich domains of various diameters can be trapped in a PEG continuous phase , with the kinetics of domain maturation dependent on the degree of acrylation. The chemical composition of both hydrogel phases over time is assessed via in situ hyperspectral coherent Raman microscopy , with equilibrium concentrations consistent with the compositions derived from NMR-measured coexistence curves. Atomic force microscopy reveals that the local mechanical properties of the two phases evolve over time , even as the bulk modulus of the material remains constant , showing that the strategy permits control of mechanical properties on micrometer length scales , of relevance in generating mechanically robust materials for a range of applications. As one example , the successful encapsulation , localization , and survival of primary cells are demonstrated and suggest the potential application of phase-separated RLP-PEG hydrogels in regenerative medicine applications.
