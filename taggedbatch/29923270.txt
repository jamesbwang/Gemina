 Unprotected sex has been linked independently to alcohol and marijuana use , but few studies have examined associations with dual use or gender differences in these associations. This study examined day-level associations between unprotected sex , defined as condomless vaginal sex with an opposite-sex partner , and use of alcohol , marijuana , neither , or both substances among 290 young adults ( 18-25 years , 52.3 % female) who reported either alcohol or marijuana use. Participants reported demographics , alcohol use , marijuana use , and at least one episode of condomless sex as defined above in the past 90 days ( Timeline Follow-Back). The likelihood of condomless sex was examined for days when alcohol , marijuana , neither , or both were used. Gender differences were also explored. For females , compared to days with no substance use , the estimated risk of condomless sex increased by a factor of 2.12 on alcohol use days , 1.89 on marijuana use days , and 3.39 on dual use days. Among males , the odds of condomless sex increased only slightly on alcohol use ( odds ratio ( OR) = 1.03) or marijuana use ( OR = 1.08) days , but increased by a factor of 1.71 on dual use days. Young persons who use alcohol and/or marijuana experience heightened likelihood of condomless sex. This increased likelihood is greater for women than for men on days with alcohol or marijuana use , each alone but especially when combined. Young women may be especially susceptible to the influence of alcohol and/or marijuana use on sexual behavior. ( Am J Addict 2018; XX: 1-6).
