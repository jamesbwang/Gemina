 Rcs phosphorelay system is a two-component signal transduction system , which can regulate the transcription of capsule polysaccharide and biofilm related genes in Enterobacteriaceae. In this study , microarray technology was used to investigate the overall genes regulated by RcsA , RcsB , and RcsAB and the regulation mechanism in Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , then COG analysis was performed to explore the functions of the differentially expressed genes. According to the microarray data result , a total of 45 , 223 and 217 genes regulated by RcsA , RcsB , and RcsAB were screened. The result of COG analysis suggested that inorganic ion transport and metabolism related genes have a majority in RcsA regulating genes. Most of RcsB regulated genes were showed involved in energy production and conversion process. Besides Carbohydrate transport and metabolism genes were identified as the major components of the RcsAB regulated genes. 15 differentially expressed genes were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR ( RT-qPCR). The RT-qPCR results indicated that 13 genes consistent with microarray data. The results of this study provided important evidence for further research to investigate the influence of RcsA , RcsB , RcsAB regulators and further efforts to address the diseased caused by K.pneumoniae , such as pneumonia<disease> , bacteremia , and urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease>.
