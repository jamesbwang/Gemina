 This study aimed to identify human specific metabolites of selected known or suspected endocrine disruptors ( EDCs) , mainly UV filters , used in personal care and consumer products whose metabolism has hardly been explored and to select suitable candidate biomarkers for human exposure studies using wastewater based epidemiology ( WBE). The analysis of metabolic biomarkers of target chemicals is crucial in order to distinguish between internal and external exposure , since many sources contribute to chemicals being discharged into wastewater. This was achieved through the employment of a new analytical framework for verification of biomarkers of exposure to chemicals combining human biomonitoring and water fingerprinting. Eight EDCs with unknown metabolic pathways ( benzophenone-1 ( BP-1); benzophenone-2 ( BP-2); 4,4 '- dihydroxybenzophenone ( 4,4 '- DHBP); 4-benzylphenol ( 4-BenzPh); homosalate ( HO); octocrylene ( OC); 3-benzylidene camphor ( 3-BC) , and two EDCs with known metabolism ( bisphenol A ( BPA) and benzophenone-3 ( BP-3)) were tested. The biotransformation observed consisted mainly of phase I processes such as hydrolysis and hydroxylation together with phase II conjugation reactions such as sulphation and glucuronidation. Only two chemicals ( BP-1 , BP-3) were identified in urine and three chemicals ( BPA , BP-1 , BP-3) in wastewater. Five newly discovered metabolites ( HO-Met1 , OC-Met1 , 4-BenzPh-Met4 , 4-BenzPh-Met5 and 4-BenzPh-Met6) and one previously known metabolite ( BPA-Met3) were detected in tested urine/wastewater samples from five WWTPs serving large communities ranging between 17 and 100 thousand inhabitants. The presence of metabolic biotransformation products of OC , 4-BenzPh , BPA and HO in wastewater provides evidence for internal exposure of studied populations to these chemicals.
