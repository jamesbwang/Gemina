 There is a cardiovascular unfavorable duet consisting of arterial hypertension and diabetes that is related with increased risk of heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. The latter is highly prevalent in this setting of dysregulation of glucose metabolism and high hemodynamic load and identifying predictors of incidence of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF) is a research and clinical need. Towards this end the variability of glucose regulation represent a novel dynamic way to comprehend and study the impact of glycemia. The results of the published study highlight the independent association of glycated hemoglobin A1c variability with the development of HFpEF in hypertensive diabetic patients. Based on the above , the effect of diverse antidiabetic therapies on glycemic control variability as well as the overall management of these patients in order to reduce the risk of HFpEF remain essential for the modern cardiologist. The growing epidemic of both diabetes mellitus and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) is an emerging clinical reality.
