 We examined the burden of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA) on the clothing of MRSA carriers in a hospital and long-term care facility and assessed the potential for clothing to be a source of transmission. Of 50 MRSA carriers studied , 37 ( 74 %) had MRSA recovered from clothing. For a subset of carriers with clothing contamination , transfer of MRSA from clothing to gloved hands and to a wheelchair occurred in 8 of 13 ( 62 %) and 5 of 10 ( 50 %) carriers , respectively. These findings suggest that measures to reduce clothing contamination should be investigated as a potential means to reduce MRSA transmission in healthcare settings.
