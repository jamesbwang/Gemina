 Protein arginine deiminases ( PADs) have recently emerged at the forefront of drug-discovery programs for several human disorders. Despite this , a precise understanding of their functional roles in human biology remains to be fully elucidated. This report highlights a recent development of next-generation activity-based PAD probes that are highly efficient , cell active , and metabolically stable. This discovery should rapidly expedite functional assignments of PAD biology in both normal and diseased cells , thereby leading to the development of PAD-targeted therapeutics in the near future.
