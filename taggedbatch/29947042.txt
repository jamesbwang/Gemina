 Degradable electronics represent a rapidly emerging field of science and technology with the potential to serve short-term medical implantation applications where the device disappears once its function is complete. Despite many efforts in developing new types of degradable electronics , many of such systems are nonelastic and incompatible with the dynamic motion of native soft/elastic biological tissues. Herein , a photo-crosslinkable hydrogel with integrated electronics that are highly stretchable and degradable in liquid environments is demonstrated. The fabrication process takes advantage of facile laser micromachining of conductive patterns directly onto the hydrogel under ambient conditions and permanent hydrogel-hydrogel bonding. The robustness and degradation rate of hydrogel and the laser-processed encapsulated stretchable circuits is systematically investigated in different solutions under various conditions. Biocompatibility tests with non-neoplastic cells ( HMT 3522 S1) and cancer cells ( T4-2 and MDA-MB-231) are performed in 2D and 3D cell culture systems to confirm instead of evaluate the safety of the hydrogel and its byproducts during degradation as well as the zinc metal used in this technology. As a proof of concept , a stretchable hydrogel-based device that can be used for remote/wireless delivery of thermal energy into the tissue in contact with the hydrogel is fabricated.
