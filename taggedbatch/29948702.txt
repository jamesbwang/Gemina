 Acknowledging the importance of water resources protection and sustainable management , the European Parliament enacted directives based on the `` polluter-pays '' principle aiming for `` environmental damage '' protection and restoration of water resources. The main aim of this paper is to examine , for the first time in Greece , the possibility of achieving environmental goals , such as reduction of agrochemical pollution and irrigation water use , alongside with the farmers ' willingness to undertake the environmental costs arising from their activity. In a questionnaire survey , conducted using a `` state preference '' method , participants were asked to respond on whether they are willing to absorb an `` environmental charge '' for the protection and restoration of surface and ground water. It is an essential precondition to understand the factors that affect taxpayers ' willingness to participate in the Water Framework Directive , as they are expected to cover the cost of its implementation. The identification of the driving forces that affect stakeholders ' environmental decisions can emerge as an important and useful tool in extending public participation in the Water Framework Directive.
