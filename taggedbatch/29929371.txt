 In this work , the favorable adsorption sites of aromatic compounds ( ACs) on graphene oxide ( GO) are characterized with both experimental and theoretical approaches. The results show that ACs exhibit a strong preference in adsorbing near the wrinkles and edges. Further analyses reveal that the edge-adsorption is mainly guided by the stronger π-π interaction near edges , accompanied by a stronger hydrogen bond interaction between carboxyl groups and ACs. Additionally , the water-mediated steric hindrance and flexibility of carboxyl groups also contribute to the edge-adsorption. A higher density of atoms and electrons is the main mechanism for the wrinkle-adsorption , and structural investigations indicate that the roughness serving as a steric hindrance for the ACs migration also contributes to the wrinkle-adsorption. This wrinkle- and edge-adsorption pattern will shed light on the design of GO-related environmental materials.
