 A research study entitled `` Newly-Graduated Baccalaureate Registered Nurses , the 21st Century Health Care Environment and Mapping the Landscape for Curricular Change '' explored the perceptions of newly graduated registered nurses ( NGRNs). During the research process , a model for nursing education and research was revealed and subsequently developed as an interpretative framework. Qualitative narrative inquiry research explored the perceptions of newly graduated registered nurses and shaped the creation of the Narrative Circle Model for Nursing Education and Research ( NCMNER). This paper will explain how the model represents the cyclic yet reciprocal relationship among education , research , and practice using narratives. The NCMNER provides a unique perspective by illustrating knowledge gained from narratives of NGRNs using narrative inquiry research methodology to influence nursing education and practice. Ultimately , the model will illustrate the significant implications of education and research in advancing the future of nursing with educational , social , and political change. Concepts from the NCMNER provided an interpretative framework for the major findings of the research; specifically , narratives used in educational curriculum , narratives from research methodology , and hence the relationships between narratives in education and research.
