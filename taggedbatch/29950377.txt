 Pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV<pathogen> ( PrEP) has been shown to reduce transmission of HIV<pathogen> in a number of trials; however , there is limited evidence regarding the optimal way to deliver PrEP through pre-existing UK services , particularly through fully integrated drop-in sexual health service models. PrEP in the form of Truvada was launched in Wales in July 2017. We set up a PrEP service to be delivered via our drop-in integrated sexual reproductive health service. In the first 5 months of PrEP service provision , we found unforeseen levels of comorbidity , polypharmacy and renal impairment in our cohort of PrEP patients. As a result , we have altered our service model and all patients are now followed up in booked appointment PrEP clinics run by members of the HIV<pathogen> team. Those patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) of 60-70 mL/min or with eGFR of 60-80 mL/min and with comorbidities impacting on renal function are monitored every 4-6 weeks initially , and PrEP has been incorporated into our pre-existing virtual HIV<pathogen> renal clinic for discussion with a renal physician. The PrEP team clinicians report that monitoring and managing the PrEP cohort is now easier in its appointment-only format , although some patients have reported that they would prefer a drop-in system.
