 Lymphatic filariasis<disease> , onchocerciasis and loiasis are widespread neglected tropical diseases causing serious public health problems and impacting the socio-economic climate in endemic communities. More than 100 million people currently suffer from filarial infections but disease-related symptoms and infection-induced immune mechanisms are still ambiguous. Although most infected individuals have dominant Th2 and regulatory immune responses leading to a homeostatic regulated state , filarial-induced overt pathology like lymphedema , dermal pathologies or blindness<symptom> can occur. Interestingly , besides dominant Th2 and regulatory T cell activation , increased Th17-induced immune responses were associated with filarial infection and overt helminth-induced pathology in humans. However , the immunological mechanisms of Th17 cells and the release of IL-17A during filarial infections remain unclear. To decipher the role of IL-17A during filarial infection , we naturally infected IL-17A
