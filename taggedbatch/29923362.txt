 A recent theoretical account of motor control proposes that modulation of afferent information plays a role in affecting how readily we can move. Increasing the estimate of uncertainty surrounding the afferent input is a necessary step in being able to move. It has been proposed that an inability to modulate the gain of this sensory information underlies the cardinal symptoms of Parkinson 's disease ( PD). We aimed to test this theory by modulating the uncertainty of the proprioceptive signal using high frequency peripheral vibration , to determine the subsequent effect on motor performance.We investigated if this peripheral stimulus might modulate oscillatory activity over the sensorimotor cortex in order to understand the mechanism by which peripheral vibration can change motor performance.We found that 80Hz peripheral vibration applied to the right wrist of a total of 54healthy human participants reproducibly improved performance across 4 separate randomized experiments on a number of motor control tasks ( nine hole-peg task , box and block test , reaction time task and finger tapping). Improved performance on all motor tasks ( except the amplitude of finger tapping) was also seen for a sample of 18PD patients ON medication.EEG data investigating the effect of vibration on oscillatory activity revealed a significant decrease in beta power ( 15-30Hz) over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex at the onset and offset of 80Hz vibration.This finding is consistent with a novel theoretical account of motor initiation , namely that modulating uncertainty of the proprioceptive afferent signal improves motor performance potentially by gating the incoming sensory signal and allowing for top-down proprioceptive predictions.
