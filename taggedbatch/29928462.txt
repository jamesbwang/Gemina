 Tissue-resident alveolar macrophages ( TR-AM) are depleted from the lung during the early stages of bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis<disease>. The recovery of the population of macrophages after bleomycin could be completely attributable to the recruitment and differentiation of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages ( Mo-AM). The authors used multiple lineage-trace mouse models where they selectively depleted TR-AM or Mo-AM and induced fibrosis<disease> with bleomycin. Deletion of TR-AM had no effect on the severity of the fibrotic phenotype. However , when Mo-AM were depleted animals showed attenuated fibrosis<disease> as evidenced by normalised collagen levels and recovered lung compliance.
