 Breast Cancer is a complex<disease> disease<disease> characterized by the occurrence of multiple molecular alterations. Currently , some molecular markers are in use for breast cancer diagnostic , prognostic , and predictive purposes. Thus , genetic signatures are available for improving the decision-making. The biomarkers are also essential as therapeutic approaches , but many questions remain due to the lack of efficacy on breast cancer treatment , mainly for triple-negative breast cancer subtype. Since the genetic profile of breast cancer can also be related to different ethnic groups and geographic areas , the reference populations of the genetic assays and clinical trials need to include a broader population beyond the European and North American patients. In this review , we analyzed the current and potential molecular markers that could help to improve the strategies for breast cancer therapy.
