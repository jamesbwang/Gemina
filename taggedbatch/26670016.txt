 The exon junction complex ( EJC) deposited on spliced mRNAs , plays a central role in the post-transcriptional gene regulation and specific gene expression. The EJC core complex is associated with multiple peripheral factors involved in various post-splicing events. Here , using recombinant complex reconstitution and transcriptome-wide analysis , we showed that the EJC peripheral protein complexes ASAP and PSAP form distinct complexes with the EJC core and can confer to EJCs distinct alternative splicing regulatory activities. This study provides the first evidence that different EJCs can have distinct functions , illuminating EJC-dependent gene regulation.
