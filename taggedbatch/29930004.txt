 Cardiac progenitor cells reside in the heart in adulthood , although their physiological relevance remains unknown. Here , we demonstrate that after myocardial infarction , adult Bmi1 These cells , which have a strong in vivo differentiation bias , are a mixture of endothelial- and mesenchymal-related cells with in vitro spontaneous endothelial cell differentiation capacity. Genetic lineage tracing analysis showed that heart-resident Bmi1 These findings imply that endothelial-related Bmi1
