 Rapidly developing industry raises concerns about the environmental risks of silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs) , but the effects of AgNPs on the performance and microbial community in the constructed wetlands remain unclear. In this study , long-term exposure of AgNPs in two VFCWs was conducted to determine the effects of AgNPs on the pollutant removal and microbial community structure. Before exposing AgNPs , the water quality of effluent was better in planted wetland ( CW2) , compared with unplanted wetland ( CW1). After continuous exposure of 100μg/L AgNPs , the COD ( chemical oxygen demand) removal of two CWs had no difference. However , addition of AgNPs reduced the nitrogen and phosphorus removal in two CWs , with decreasing average removal efficiencies of ammonia<pathogen> nitrogen from 46.31 % to 32.09 % and 59.66 % to 51.06 % , total nitrogen from 57.76 % to 43.78 % and 67.35 to 60.58 % , total phosphorus from 71.29 % to 59.31 % and 67.35 % to 60.58 % , respectively. The vegetable wetlands showed higher resistances to AgNPs loading than unplanted wetlands. In addition , AgNPs accumulated in the wetland substrate , especially in the soil layer with the silver concentration of approximately 4.32 μg/g. The small portion of silver was found in plant tissues , and plants played a minor role to remove the AgNPs from wastewater. Moreover , the constructed wetlands could effectively remove the AgNPs from the synthetic wastewater. The illumine high-throughput sequencing results demonstrated the variations of the bacterial community structure at the exposure of AgNPs. The results showed that the dominant phyla were Proteobacteria , Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Compared with unplanted wetlands , the contents of several nitrifying bacteria such as Candidatus<pathogen> Nitrososphaera ( AOA) and Nitrospira ( NOB) at genus level increased , leading to the higher nitrogen removal in the planted wetlands.
