 This study explored the long-run association among greenhouse gases ( GHGs) , financial development , forest<disease> area , improved sanitation , renewable energy , urbanization , and trade in 24 lower middle-income countries from Asia , Europe , Africa , and America ( South and North) by using panel data from 1990 to 2015. Granger causality was tested by Toda and Yamamoto approach. The bi-directional causality was established among urbanization and GHGs ( Asia) , financial development and forest<disease> ( Asia) , energy use and renewable energy ( Asia) , renewable energy and forest<disease> ( Asia) , improved sanitation and forest<disease> ( Asia , Africa , America) , urbanization and forest<disease> ( Asia) , and improved sanitation and financial development ( Europe). The GHG emission also shows one-way causality is running from financial development to GHG ( America) , energy to GHG ( Asia) , renewable energy to GHG ( America) , forest<disease> area to GHG ( America) , trade openness to GHG ( Africa) , urbanization to GHG ( Europe) , GHG to financial development ( Europe) , GHG to energy use ( Europe , Africa , and America) , and GHG to trade openness ( Asia). On the basis of fully modified ordinary least square and generalized method of moment , the reciprocal relationship of GHGs was observed due to financial development in Asia and Africa; renewable energy in all panels; forest<disease> area in Asia , Europe , and America; improved sanitation in Asia , Africa , and America; trade openness in Africa; and urbanization in Europe and America. Policymakers should concentrate on these variables for the reduction in GHGs. The annual convergence towards long-run equilibrium was 50.5 , 31.9 , and 20.9 % for America , Asia , and Africa , respectively.
