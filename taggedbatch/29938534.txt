 Despite national recommendations , routine opt-out HIV<pathogen> testing has not been widely adopted by physicians. Guided by previous research on physician barriers to HIV<pathogen> testing , we developed a physician-targeted video to promote routine opt-out HIV<pathogen> screening. The objective of this study was to evaluate this video intervention. From June to July 2016 , physicians in two primary care clinics completed an online survey prior to and after watching the video. Survey items assessed acceptability of the video and HIV<pathogen> testing knowledge , attitudes , and intention to screen. Descriptive statistics were generated to analyze data. Of the 53 participants , 90 % liked or strongly liked the video. Pre- to postvideo , significant improvements were seen in the knowledge of national HIV<pathogen> screening recommendations ( 45.3 % to 67.9 %; p = .010) and of the proportion of unaware Houstonians living with HIV<pathogen> ( 22.6 % to 75.5 %; p < .001). Participant beliefs about the likelihood of patients accepting HIV<pathogen> testing increased from 47.2 % to 84.9 % pre- to postvideo ( p < .001). Intention to screen did not change; participants had high intentions pre- and postvideo. Our study found that a video is an acceptable HIV<pathogen> testing promotion medium for physicians. Our video improved physician HIV<pathogen> testing knowledge and attitudes , overcoming key barriers to HIV<pathogen> testing.
