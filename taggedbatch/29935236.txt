 It is currently uncertain whether non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) is associated with an increased risk of colorectal tumours. We performed a meta-analysis of relevant observational studies to quantify the magnitude of the association between NAFLD and risk of colorectal adenomas and cancer. We searched PubMed , Scopus and Web of Science from January 2000 to November 2017 using pre-defined keywords to identify observational studies of asymptomatic adults undergoing screening colonoscopy , in which NAFLD was diagnosed by imaging or histology. Data from selected studies were extracted and meta-analysis was performed using random-effects modelling. Eleven observational studies ( 8 cross-sectional and 3 longitudinal) with aggregate data on 91,124 asymptomatic adults of predominantly Asian descent ( 32.1 % with NAFLD) accounting for a total of 14,911 colorectal adenomas and 1684 cancers were included in the final analysis. NAFLD was associated with an increased risk of prevalent colorectal adenomas ( n = 7 studies using liver imaging techniques; random-effects odds ratio ( OR) 1.28 , 95 % CI 1.11-1.48; I This meta-analysis of observational studies ( involving asymptomatic individuals of predominantly Asian descent undergoing screening colonoscopy) suggests that NAFLD ( detected by imaging or biopsy) is independently associated with a moderately increased prevalence and incidence of colorectal adenomas and cancer. However , the observational design of the studies does not allow for proving causality , and the possibility of residual confounding by some unmeasured factors can not be ruled out. More prospective studies , particularly in European and American individuals , and mechanistic studies are required to better understand the association between NAFLD and colonic carcinogenesis.
