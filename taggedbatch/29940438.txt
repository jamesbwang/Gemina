 Commercial cellulase preparations for lignocellulose bioconversion are mainly produced by the fungus Trichoderma<pathogen> reesei. The maximum cellulose conversion of T. reesei cellulase mixture was 15 % -20 % higher than that of Penicillium oxalicum in the hydrolysis of corncob residue and Avicel. Nevertheless , both preparations hydrolyzed more than 92 % of cellulose in NaOH-mercerized Avicel. When added to Avicel hydrolysis residue that was less reactive to P. oxalicum cellulases , cellobiohydrolase I ( CBH I) from T. reesei resulted in a higher cellulose conversion than its homologous proteins from P. oxalicum and Aspergillus<pathogen> niger<pathogen> at the same protein loadings. Further domain exchange experiment attributed the high hydrolytic efficiency of T. reesei CBH I to its inter-domain linker and cellulose-binding domain. The results in part explained the superior performance of T. reesei cellulases on the degradation of native crystalline cellulose , and highlighted the important role of cellulose-binding region in determining the degree of hydrolysis by cellulases.
