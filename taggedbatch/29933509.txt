- To estimate readmission rates for acute ischemic stroke ( AIS) , transient ischemic attack ( TIA) , subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> , and intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> after an index admission for migraine , using nationally representative data.- The Nationwide Readmissions Database was designed to analyze readmissions for all payers and uninsured , with data on > 14 million US admissions in 2013. We used International Classification of Diseases , Ninth Revision , Clinical Modification codes to identify index migraine admissions with and without aura or status migrainosus , and readmissions for cerebrovascular events. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed for each outcome with aura and status migrainosus as main predictors , adjusting for age and vascular risk factors.- Out of 12,448 index admissions for migraine , 9972 ( 80.1 %) were women , mean age was 45.5 Â± 14.8 years , aura was present in 3038 ( 24.41 %) , and status migrainosus in 1798 ( 14.44 %). The 30-day readmission rate ( per 100,000 index admissions) was 154 for ischemic stroke , 86 for TIA , 42 for subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> , and 17 for intracranial hemorrhage<symptom>. In unadjusted models , aura was significantly associated with TIA ( hazard ratio 2.43 , 95 % CI 1.39-4.24) , but not AIS ( 1.26 , 0.73-2.18) , intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> ( 1.86 , 0.45-7.79) or subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( 1.85 , 0.44-7.75). When adjusting for age and vascular risk factors , aura remained significantly associated with TIA ( 2.13 , 1.22-3.74). Status , in adjusted models , was significantly associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> readmission ( 4.83 , 1.09-21.42).- In this large , nationally representative retrospective cohort study , migraine admission with aura was independently associated with TIA readmission , and status migrainosus was independently associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom>. Further research would clarify the role of misdiagnosis and causal relationships underlying these strong associations.
