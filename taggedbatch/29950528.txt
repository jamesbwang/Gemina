 the expression of CD30 , CD15 , CD50 , and PAX5 are used to help in confirming diagnosis of HL and sALCL; however data on the proportion of these markers have not been available. The study was aimed to identify the proportion of CD30 , CD15 , CD50 and PAX5 expressions and characteristics of patients with HL and sALCL at Dharmais National Cancer Center Hospital between 2005 and 2015. a retrospective observational study was conducted using data from medical records and histopathological results of HL and sALCL adult patients who sought treatment at the hospital between 2005 and 2015. Immunohistochemistry ( IHC) examinations were performed and data on the proportion of positive CD30 , CD15 , CD50 , and PAX5 expressions were analyzed descriptively. a total of 45 patients were recruited in this study , with the majority ( 42 patients , 93.3 %) were HL patients and only 6.7 % were sALCL patients. The median age of HL patients was younger than sALCL patients; 35 ( 18-72 years old) versus 54 ( 49-61 years old). Moreover , the immunohistochemistry examination demonstrated that the positive CD15 , CD30 , CD50 , and PAX5 expressions were found respectively in 37.5 % , 88.9 % , 31.2 % , and 31.2 % patients with HL; while in patients with sALCL , in spite of their small sample size , positive CD30 , CD15 , CD50 and PAX5 expressions were found in 100 %; 66,7 %; 50 %; and 50 % , respectively. Overall , CD15 , CD50 , and PAX5 positive expressions were found in 39.5 % , 32.4 % , and 32.4 % patients who had HL and sALCL; while positive expression of CD30 was found in 89.5 % of them. present study shows that almost 90 % patients have positive CD30 expression; while the positive expressions of CD15 , CD50 , and PAX5 are found in less than 40 % patients. It indicates that CD30 is an important diagnostic marker for HL and sALCL and it may improve treatment strategy.
