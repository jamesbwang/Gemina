 Peptide Nucleic Acids ( PNAs) are oligonucleotide mimics that can be used as drugs as they can interact with DNA and RNA targets in organisms. Loading PNAs into inorganic nanocarriers can improve their cellular uptake and co-delivering them together with drugs can improve the therapy efficacy by synergic effects. Furthermore , the functionalization of the carriers with labels allows theranostics , and the possibility to monitor the efficacy of the therapy in real time. The present protocol describes the synthesis of Zeolites-L nanocrystals and mesoporous silica nanoparticles and their loading with cationic PNAs and other smaller molecular weight payloads towards theranostics applications.
