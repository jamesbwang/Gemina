 To establish the adriamycin ( ADR)- resistant ALL cell lines and to investigate their drug-resistan mechanisms. The drug-resistant cell lines SUP-B15/ ADR and RS4; 11/ADR were derived by exposing the parental cells ( SUP-B15 ( Ph The drug-resistant cell lines SUP-B15/ ADR and RS4; 11/ADR were successfully established , their resistance indexes were 14.088 ± 0.763 and 10.473 ± 1.024 , respectively. After the cryopreserved SUP-B15/ ADR and RS4; 11/ADR cells were resuscitated , their survival rates were 88.4 ± 1.2 % and 89.3 ± 1.6 % respectively , while their resistance indexes were 13.976 ± 0.967 and 10.342 ± 0.846 respectively ( P > 0.05). When the drug-resistant cells were cultured in the medium without ADR for 1 month , their drug-resistance indexes dropped down to 12.893 ± 1.255 and 9.327 ± 0.321 respectively ( P < 0.05). Drug-resistant cell lines had the cross-resistance to cytarabine and etoposide. The expression of P-gp and MDR1 in drug-resistant cells was significantly higher than that in wild-type cells. Two drug-resistant ALL cell lines have been successfully established by exposing to the ascending concentration of ADR. The over-expression of MDR1 and P-gp in drug-resistant cells may be one of the mechanisms underlying the drug resistance.
