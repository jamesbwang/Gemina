 Engineering of GPCR constructs with improved thermostability is a key for successful structural and biochemical studies of this transmembrane protein family , targeted by 40 % of all therapeutic drugs. Here we introduce a comprehensive computational approach to effective prediction of stabilizing mutations in GPCRs , named CompoMug , which employs sequence-based analysis , structural information , and a derived machine learning predictor. Tested experimentally on the serotonin 5-HT
