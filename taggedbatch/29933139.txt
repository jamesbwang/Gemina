 The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of citric acid containing fluoride , nano-hydroxyapatite , and casein on eroded enamel. The crowns of 120 extracted bovine incisors were embedded in acrylic resin. An enamel window ( 2 × 3 mm) was created on the surface. Before in vitro pellicle formation samples were eroded in 1 % citric acid ( pH = 3.2) for 1 h at 36 °C and were randomly classified to eight groups ( n = 15) as follows: Positive control: 1 % citric acid , Negative control: Distilled water , F1: 0.047 mmol/L sodium fluoride , F2: 0.071 mmol/L sodium fluoride , NHA1: % 0.05 Nano-Hydroxyapatite , NHA2: % 0.1 Nano-Hydroxyapatite , C1: % 0.02 Casein , C2: % 0.2 Casein. Erosion cycling was performed three times daily for 3 days. In each cycle , the samples were immersed in 10 mL of control or modified solutions ( 10 min) and in 10 mL of artificial saliva ( 60 min). The surface roughness and enamel loss were analyzed by using profilometer , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) and atomic force microscopy techniques ( AFM). Among the groups , the positive control group was found to be having the highest erosive wear. Erosive wear in the F2 , NHA2 , C1 , and C2 groups was not significantly different from the negative control group ( p > 0.05). The C1 and C2 groups showed that erosion terminated and minimal tissue recovery occurred on the enamel surface. Although all modifications reduced further demineralization , the citric acid modification with casein was found to be having a greater impact on dental erosion than the others.
