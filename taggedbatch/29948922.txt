 The founders of modern biology ( Jean Lamarck , Charles Darwin , August Weismann etc.) were organismic life scientists who attempted to understand the morphology and evolution of living beings as a whole ( i.e. , the phenotype). However , with the emergence of the study of animal and plant physiology in the nineteenth century , this `` holistic view '' of the living world changed and was ultimately replaced by a reductionistic perspective. Here , I summarize the history of systems biology , i.e. , the modern approach to understand living beings as integrative organisms , from genotype to phenotype. It is documented that the physiologists Claude Bernard and Julius Sachs , who studied humans and plants , respectively , were early pioneers of this discipline , which was formally founded 50 years ago. In 1968 , two influential monographs , authored by Ludwig von Bertalanffy and Mihajlo D. MesaroviÄ‡ , were published , wherein a `` systems theory of biology '' was outlined. Definitions of systems biology are presented with reference to metabolic or cell signaling networks , analyzed via genomics , proteomics , and other methods , combined with computer simulations/mathematical modeling. Then , key insights of this discipline with respect to epiphytic microbes ( Methylobacterium<pathogen> sp.) and simple bacteria ( Mycoplasma<pathogen> sp.) are described. The principles of homeostasis , molecular systems energetics , gnotobiology , and holobionts ( i.e. , complexities of host-microbiota interactions) are outlined , and the significance of systems biology for evolutionary theories is addressed. Based on the microbe-Homo sapiens-symbiosis , it is concluded that human biology and health should be interpreted in light of a view of the biomedical sciences that is based on the holobiont concept.
