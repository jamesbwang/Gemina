 The glucose-regulated protein 78 ( GRP78) is a molecular chaperone that is responsible for protein folding , which belongs to the heat shock<symptom> protein 70 kDa ( HSPA/HSP70). Because of the conjunction of GRP78 transcription with endoplasmic reticulum stress , the chaperone plays an important role in the unfolded protein response ( UPR) , which is induced after the accumulation of misfolded proteins. In the last years , a significant body of research concentrated on interplay between GRP78 and sexual steroid hormones. Throughout this review , we describe the mechanisms by which GRP78 regulates steroidogenesis at multiple levels and how steroids modulate GRP78 expression in different mammalian reproductive organs. Finally , we discuss the cooperation between GRP78 and steroids for cell survival and proliferation in the context of reproduction and tumorigenesis. This new paradigm offers significant opportunities for future exploration.
