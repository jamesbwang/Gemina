 Improved systemic treatment has improved the prognosis of metastatic melanoma ( MM). However , brain metastases ( BMs) are a frequent complication. We aimed to explore the outcome of these patients with modern therapeutic options. We retrospectively analyzed 142 patients diagnosed with BM from MM at two institutions in Brisbane , Queensland , Australia during 2009-2016. Basic clinico-pathological parameters , treatments used and mortality data were collected. With a median follow-up of 8 months , 115 patients had died , 112 from MM and 99 from neurologic death. Management included ablative therapy ( n = 8) , ablative therapy with targeted/immunotherapy ( n = 54) , targeted/immunotherapy ( n = 55) and whole-brain radiotherapy/best supportive care ( n = 25). The median overall survival ( OS) was 8 ( 6.9-9.1) months. Statistically improved OS was found with the use of ablative techniques and BRAF/MEK tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI) post diagnosis of BM. In BRAF mutant patients ( n = 117) who were TKI na√Øve at diagnosis of BM ( n = 60) , the median OS was 9 ( 6.2-11.8) months versus 5 ( 1.1-8.9) months in patients who developed BM on TKI treatment ( P = 0.001). A complete intracranial response rate occurred in 12 % of patients who had immunotherapy ( n = 65) with all but two patients receiving stereotactic radiosurgery and no deaths have occurred in this group. The outcomes of those with BM remain poor , particularly of those with BRAF mutant MM who fail TKI therapy with new BM. Most patients present with multiple BM and death is frequently due to neurological<symptom> progressive disease. The use of ablative techniques and TKI use confers a longer OS in selected patients.
