 Oral health-related quality of life ( OHRQoL) is a construct for assessing the self-perceived oral health of patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between OHRQoL and orthodontic treatment need in consideration of demographic and psychological factors. This multicentre study included 250 patients with an indication for orthodontic diagnostics. In cooperation with the Institute of Clinical Psychology at the University of WÃ¼rzburg , validated and internationally acknowledged questionnaires were selected to assess OHRQoL ( COHIP-G19) and health-related quality of life ( HRQOL). Self-esteem and behavioural problems were taken into consideration as possible psychological factors. Orthodontic treatment need was assessed using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need-Dental Health Component ( IOTN-DHC) , the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need-Aesthetic Component ( IOTN-AC) and the Dental Aesthetic Index ( DAI). Possible significant correlations between the collected parameters and OHRQoL were evaluated by means of linear regression analysis. Objective orthodontic treatment need ( IOTN-DHC and DAI) was significantly correlated with OHRQoL. Further factors significantly influencing OHRQoL in children and adolescents were age , HRQOL , self-esteem and behavioural problems. Objective orthodontic treatment need significantly influences OHRQoL in children and adolescents. Further studies are required to investigate if OHRQoL may be improved by correcting misaligned teeth and jaws.
