 Ultrafiltration ( UF) is one of the significant advanced processes for oily wastewater treatment due to its clear advantages , for instance , ease in operation and efficient separation. The main drawback of these processes is the fouling problem and many researchers ' effort on fabrication of high-performance membranes<symptom> with higher hydrophilicity and antifouling properties. In this study , flat-sheet polysulfone ( PSF)/ polyethylenimine ( PEI)/ CaCO
