 Understanding and acquiring language involve mapping language onto conceptual representations. Nevertheless , several issues remain unresolved with respect to ( a) how such mappings are performed , and ( b) whether conceptual representations are susceptible to cross-linguistic influences. In this article , we discuss these issues focusing on the domain of evidentiality and sources of knowledge. Empirical evidence in this domain yields growing support for the proposal that linguistic categories of evidentiality are tightly linked to , build on , and reflect conceptual representations of sources of knowledge that are shared across speakers of different languages.
