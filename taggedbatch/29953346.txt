 DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation exposure is enhanced in the presence of oxygen ( the `` oxygen effect ''). Despite its practical importance in radiotherapy , the oxygen effect has largely been excluded from models that predict DNA damage from radiation tracks. A Monte Carlo-based algorithm was developed in MATLAB software to predict DNA damage from physical and chemical tracks through a cell nucleus simulated in Geant4-DNA , taking into account the effects of cellular oxygenation ( pO
