 The advent of single-cell omics technology has promoted our understanding of the genomic , epigenomic , and transcriptomic heterogeneity in individual cells. Compared to traditional sequencing studies using bulk cells , single-cell transcriptome technology is naturally more dynamic for in depth analysis of genomic variation resulting from cell division and is useful in unraveling the regulatory mechanisms of gene networks in many diseases. However , there are still some limitations of current single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq) protocols. Biases that arise during the RNA reverse transcription and cDNA pre-amplification steps are the most common problems and play pivotal roles in limiting the quantitative accuracy of scRNA-seq. In this review , we will describe how these biases emerge and impact scRNA-seq protocols. Moreover , we will introduce several current and convenient modified scRNA-seq methods that allow for bias to be decreased and estimated.
