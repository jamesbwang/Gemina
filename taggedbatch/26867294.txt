 More extreme cold weather and larger weather variations have raised concerns regarding their effects on public health. Although prior studies assessed the effects of cold air temperature on health , especially mortality , limited studies evaluated wind chill<symptom> temperatures on morbidity , and health effects under the current cold warning threshold. This study identified the thresholds , lag periods , and best indicators of extreme cold on cardiovascular disease ( CVD) by comparing effects of wind chill<symptom> temperatures and cold air temperatures on CVD emergency department ( ED) visits in winter and winter transition months. Information was collected on 662,625 CVD ED visits from statewide hospital discharge dataset in New<pathogen> York State. Meteorological factors , including air temperature , wind speed , and barometric pressure were collected from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A case-crossover approach was used to assess the extreme cold-CVD relationship in winter ( December-February) and transition months ( November and March) after controlling for PM
