 Bacterial toxin-antitoxin ( TA) systems are emerging important regulators of multiple cellular physiological events and candidates for novel antibiotic targets. To explore the role of Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> function , unknown toxin gene Rv2872 was heterologously expressed in Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> smegmatis<pathogen> ( MS_Rv2872). Upon induction , MS_Rv2872 phenotype differed significantly from the control , such as increased vancomycin resistance , retarded growth , cell wall , and biofilm structure. This phenotype change might result from the RNase activity of Rv2872 as purified Rv2872 toxin protein can cleave the products of several key genes involved in abovementioned phenotypes. In summary , toxin Rv2872 was firstly reported to be a endonuclease involved in antibiotic stress responses , cell wall structure , and biofilm development.
