 Photo-reactive poly ( vinyl alcohol) ( PRPVA) was synthesized by introduction of phenyl azido groups into poly ( vinyl alcohol) ( PVA) and applied for surface modification. PRPVA was grafted onto cell culture plate surface homogeneously or in a micropattern. Human mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs) cultured on cell culture plate surface and PVA-modified surface showed different behaviors. Cells adhered and spread well on cell culture plate surface , while they did not adhere on PVA-grafted surface at all. When hMSCs were cultured on PVA-micropatterned surface , they formed a cell micropattern. Cells formed pellets after cultured on PVA homogeneously modified surface in chondrogenic induction medium for 2 weeks. The pellets were positively stained by hematoxylin/eosin , safranin-O/fast green and toluidin blue , and they were also stained brown by Type II collagen and proteoglycan immunohistological staining. Real-time PCR analysis was conducted to investigate the expression of colI<pathogen> , colII , colX , aggrecan and sox9 mRNA. Results of gene expression were in agreement with those of histological and immunohistological observations. These results indicated that hMSCs cultured on PVA-modified surface performed chondrogenic differentiation , and it was possible to construct scaffold-free cartilage like pellets with PVA-modified surface
