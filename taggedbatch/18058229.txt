 Studies on the association of cytochrome p450 A1 ( m1 , m2) , catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT) H108L , glutathione S-transferase ( GST) T1 and M1 polymorphisms with breast cancer risk were inconclusive. The current study was aimed to clarify the ambiguity in genetic associations of these enzymes with breast cancer risk on a global perspective. A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed , Google Scholar and Medline , covering all the case-control studies published until September 2017. A meta-analysis was performed based on the random-effect and fixed-effect models to calculate the overall association of each genetic variant with breast cancer risk. Of the five polymorphisms studied , GSTT1 ( OR: 1.07 , 95 % CI: 1.02-1.12 and OR: 1.08 , 95 % CI: 1.01-1.15 for fixed-effect and random-effect models , respectively) and GSTM1 ( OR: 1.22 , 95 % CI: 1.17-1.26 and OR: 1.25 , 95 % CI: 1.12-1.35 for fixed-effect and random-effect models , respectively) null polymorphisms exhibited an increased risk for breast cancer in both the models. Cochrane Q-test and I Â² statistics revealed heterogeneity in association with these polymorphisms (
