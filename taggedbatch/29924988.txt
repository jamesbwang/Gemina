 Action selection relies on the coordinated activity of striatal direct and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons ( dMSNs and iMSNs , respectively). Loss of dopamine in Parkinson 's disease is thought to disrupt this balance<symptom>. While dopamine replacement with levodopa may restore normal function , the development of involuntary<symptom> movements<symptom> ( levodopa-induced dyskinesia ( LID)) limits therapy. How chronic dopamine loss and replacement with levodopa modulate the firing of identified MSNs in behaving animals is unknown. Using optogenetically labeled striatal single-unit recordings , we assess circuit dysfunction in parkinsonism and LID. Counter to current models , we found that following dopamine depletion , iMSN firing was elevated only during periods of immobility , while dMSN firing was dramatically and persistently reduced. Most notably , we identified a subpopulation of dMSNs with abnormally high levodopa-evoked firing rates , which correlated specifically with dyskinesia. These findings provide key insights into the circuit mechanisms underlying parkinsonism and LID , with implications for developing targeted therapies.
