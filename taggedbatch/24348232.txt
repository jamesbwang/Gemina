 In this paper , we study application of Le Cam 's one-step method to parameter estimation in ordinary differential equation models. This computationally simple technique can serve as an alternative to numerical evaluation of the popular non-linear least squares estimator , which typically requires the use of a multistep iterative algorithm and repetitive numerical integration of the ordinary differential equation system. The one-step method starts from a preliminary
