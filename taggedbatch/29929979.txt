 Certain dysregulated chondrocyte metabolic adaptive responses such as decreased activity of the master regulator of energy metabolism AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK) , promote osteoarthritis ( OA). Metabolism intersects with epigenetic and transcriptional responses. Hence , we studied chondrocyte ATP-citrate lyase ( ACLY) , which generates acetyl-CoA from mitochondrial-derived citrate , and modulates acetylation of histones and transcription factors. We assessed ACLY in normal and OA human knee chondrocytes and cartilages by Western blot and immunohistochemistry , and quantified acetyl-CoA fluorometrically. We examined histone and transcription factor lysine acetylation by Western blot , and assessed histone H3K9 and H3K27 occupancy of
