 Although a simple bone cyst<symptom> carries the risk of pathological fractures , it rarely causes severe deformity. Here we report a case of severe femoral deformity after multiple pathological fractures due to simple bone cysts<symptom> , and consider the reason for the progression of malunion despite multiple previous treatments. Finally , we propose a treatment option for malunion correction. A 9-year , 7-month-old Japanese girl was referred to our facility with obvious deformity of her right femur , caused by multiple simple bone cyst-related pathological fractures. The deformity included bowing of approximately 90 ° and an internal rotation of 60 ° in the middle third of the femoral shaft. To correct this deformity , we excised the lesion<symptom> , thus shortening the femur , then corrected the alignment and applied an Ilizarov fixator to extend the bone. At present , 3 years after surgery , the deformity has not recurred and our patient is living without any limitations in daily activities or regular exercise. When a long bone is in a prolonged state of deformation , the deformity not only progresses as the bone grows , but the soft<disease> tissues remain unbalanced and treatment becomes increasingly difficult. To prevent increasing bone deformity and fragility , the deformity should be corrected as quickly as possible using intramedullary nailing or other fixation techniques. We believe that our shortening-distraction method is effective for the treatment of severe deformity with unbalanced soft<disease> tissues.
