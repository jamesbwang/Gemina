 Vimentin ( VIM) is a type III intermediate filament that maintains cell integrity , and is involved in cell migration , motility and adhesion. When overexpressed in solid cancers , vimentin drives epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT) and ultimately , metastasis. The effects of its overexpression in AML are unclear. In this study , we analyzed the TCGA data of 173 AML patients for which complete clinical and expression data were available. In this analysis , we assessed the association between VIM mRNA expression and patient 's clinical and molecular characteristics including clinical outcome. VIM overexpression was associated with higher white blood count ( < p = 0.0001). Patients with high VIM expression have worse overall survival ( OS) and disease-free survival ( DFS) compared with patients with low VIM expression ( median OS; 7.95 months vs 19.2 months; p = 0.029). After age-stratification , high VIM expression was significantly associated with worse overall survival in older patients ( age â‰¥ 60; median OS: 5.4 vs 9.9 months: p = 0.0257) but not in younger patients ( age < 60). In stratification analysis according to cytogenetic status , high VIM expression was significantly associated with shorter OS ( 7.95 vs 24.6 months: p = 0.0102) in cytogenetically normal , but not in cytogenetic abnormal AML. Collectively , the data indicate that overexpression of the EMT marker vimentin is associated with poor clinical outcome in older patients with cytogenetically normal AML; and therefore may play a role in this disease.
