 In the United States , buildings account for more than 40 % of total energy consumption and the evolution of the urban form will impact the effectiveness of strategies to reduce energy use and mitigate emissions. This paper presents a broadly applicable approach for modeling future commercial , residential , and industrial floorspace , thermal consumption ( heating and cooling) , and associated GHG emissions at the tax assessor land parcel level. The approach accounts for changing building standards and retrofitting , climate change , and trends in housing and industry. We demonstrate the automated workflow for California and project building stock , thermal energy consumption , and associated GHG emissions out to 2050. Our results suggest that if buildings in California have long lifespans , and minimal energy efficiency improvements compared to building codes reflective of 2008 , then the state will face a 20 % or higher increase in thermal energy consumption by 2050. Baseline annual GHG emissions associated with thermal energy consumption in the modeled building stock in 2016 is 34 % below 1990 levels ( 110 Mt CO
