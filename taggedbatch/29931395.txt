 A 75-year-old female patient presented with bilateral progressive<symptom> loss<symptom> of vision. Best corrected visual acuity ( BCVA) was hand movements in the right eye and 1/50 in the left eye. The spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT) showed thinning of the outer retina suspected to be due to autoimmune retinopathy. A neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterus was diagnosed during tumor screening. Under systemic therapy with corticosteroids the visual acuity improved to 20/200 in the right eye and 20/80 in the left eye. Cancer-associated retinopathy ( CAR) is a paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy.
