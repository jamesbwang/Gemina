 Bioerosion , the removal of calcium carbonate from coral frameworks by living organisms , influences a variety of reef features , from their topographic complexity to the net balance<symptom> of carbonate budgets. Little is known , however , about how macroborers , which bore into reef substrates leaving traces greater than 0.1 mm diameter , are distributed across coral reefs , particularly reef systems with high ( > 50 %) stony coral cover or at mesophotic depths ( â‰¥ 30 m). Here , we present an accurate and efficient method for quantifying macroborer densities from stony coral hosts via image analysis , using the bioeroding barnacle , Lithotrya dorsalis , and its host coral , Orbicella franksi , as a case study. We found that in 2014 , L. dorsalis densities varied consistently with depth and host percent cover in two Atlantic reef systems: the Flower Garden Banks ( FGB , northwest Gulf of Mexico) and the U.S. Virgin Islands ( USVI). Although average barnacle density was nearly 4.5 times greater overall in the FGB than in the USVI , barnacle density decreased with depth in both reef regions. Barnacle density also scaled negatively with increasing coral cover in the study areas , suggesting that barnacle populations are not strictly space-limited in their distribution and settlement opportunities. Our findings suggest that depth and host coral cover , and potentially , local factors may strongly influence the abundance of macroborers , and thus the rate of CaCO3 loss , in a given reef system. Our image analysis method for quantifying macroborers can be standardized across historical and modern reef records to better understand how borers impact host growth and reef health.
