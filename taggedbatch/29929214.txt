 CeO Knudsen effusion<symptom> mass spectrometry was used to determine the partial pressures of vapor species and the equilibrium constants of gas-phase reactions , as well as the formation and atomization enthalpies of gaseous cerium molybdates and tungstates. CeO In the temperature range 2050-2400 K , CeO , CeO The thermal stability of gaseous cerium oxyacid salts was confirmed by high-temperature mass spectrometry. Reaction enthalpies of the gaseous cerium molybdates and tungstates from gaseous cerium , molybdenum and tungsten oxides were evaluated theoretically and the obtained values are in reasonable agreement with the experimental one.
