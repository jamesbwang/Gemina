 The purpose of this study was to apply a risk-based approach to the development of a quality management ( QM) program for ultrasound-based high-dose-rate ( HDR) prostate brachytherapy ( pBT) treatment planning and delivery. A QM program was developed by a multidisciplinary team , using both an in-house risk-and-benefit balance<symptom> impact template ( RABBIT) tool and a failure modes and effect analysis ( FMEA). FMEA scores were determined by three physicists , one radiation therapist and two radiation oncologists who were familiar with the protocol. The QM program produced by both risk-based techniques was then compared and consolidated. The RABBIT tool identified 26 potential risks during the treatment planning and delivery process. During the FMEA , a total of 35 potential failure modes were identified from the seven major processes in ultrasound-based HDR pBT. For the 35 potential failure modes , risk priority number scores ranged from 14 to 267. The highest ranked failure mode was identified to be mislabeling/connection of the transfer tubes/catheters. From the risks analyses , a comprehensive QM program was developed. Both the RABBIT tool and process mapping and FMEA were shown to be valuable tools in developing a QM program for ultrasound-based HDR pBT treatments. A considerable number of the potential failure modes identified in both tools were related to human or procedural errors , highlighting the importance of checklists and protocols in delivering a safe and effective ultrasound-based HDR pBT treatment.
