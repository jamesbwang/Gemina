 There is some evidence indicating that Matricaria chamomile ( MC) had protective effects on ischemiareperfusion. In the present study , a rat model was used to investigate the effect of hydroalcoholic extract of MC on torsion/detorsion-induced testis tissue damage. In this experimental study , 28 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups as follows: G1 , Sham operated; G2 , testicular torsion/detorsion ( T/D); G3 , rats with testicular torsion/detorsion that received 300 mg/kg of MC extracts 30 minutes before detorsion ( T/DMC); and G4 , healthy rats that received 300 mg/kg of MC extracts ( MC). Also , the reperfusion period was 24 hours. After blood sampling , the oxidative stress marker ( e.g. superoxide dismutase ( SOD) levels) , blood levels of testosterone , and anti-oxidant enzyme levels ( e.g. glutathione peroxidase ( GPx)) were assessed by ELISA methods. Serum activity of malondialdehyde ( MDA) was evaluated by spectrophotometry. Another assessment was carried out by histomorphometry , 24-hour post-procedure. The histological parameters investigated by Johnson 's scores ( JS) , also the seminiferous tubule diameter ( STD) and the height of the germinal epithelium ( HE) measured using the linear eyepiece grids using light microscopy. Histological features significantly differed between sham and the other groups. The levels of SOD , GPx , and testosterone hormone were significantly decreased in T/D group as compared to sham group , while these parameters increased in T/DMC group as compared to T/D group. During ischemia , the MDA levels increased; however , treatment with MC extract decreased the MDA levels in G3 and G4 groups. Results of the present study demonstrated that MC can protect the testis tissue against torsion/detorsioninduced damages by suppressing superoxide production.
