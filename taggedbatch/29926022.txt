 The fabrication of graphene electrode with three-dimensional ( 3D) porous architecture would be highly desirable for electrochemical ( bio-) sensing. Direct-laser-writing ( DLW) on polyimide sheet has been recognized as an advance approach to pattern 3D porous graphene frameworks ( 3DPGFs)- based electrode. Herein , taking advantages of this straightforward and cost-effective DLW technique , we demonstrated the scalable and robust fabrication of a new type of 3DPGFs-based electrode patterned on the surface of indium-tin oxide ( ITO) glass , denoted as 3DPGF@ITO. In this study , polyimide layer was synthesized on ITO glass surface not only to act as a sacrificial precursor for the in situ growth of 3DPGFs , but also to serve as a passivation layer for the effective separation of 3DPGFs working area and ITO contact pad. Importantly , the laser-induced 3DPGFs on ITO surface exhibit a 3D hierarchical and macroporous architecture consisting of interconnected multi-layered graphene sheets with large surface area and abundant edge-plane-like defective sites. These appealing features render the proposed 3DPGF@ITO electrode with marked improvement in electrochemical performance over traditional commercial electrodes. Finally , the developed 3DPGF@ITO electrode was successfully applied as a working electrode to selectively detect three important biospecies , namely , ascorbic acid , dopamine , and uric acid , in their ternary mixture with a high resolution of oxidation potentials. Thus , we envision that the 3DPGF@ITO electrode will open highly promising perspectives for the development of sensitive electrode-based ( bio-) sensors.
