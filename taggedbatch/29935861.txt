 Abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> ( AAA) is three to five times more common among men compared with women , yet up to 38 % of all aneurysm<disease> related deaths affect women. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of synchronous or metachronous aneurysms<disease> among women with AAA , as diagnosis and treatment could improve survival. This is a retrospective study of prospectively registered patients. All women operated on , or under surveillance for , AAA were identified at two Swedish hospitals. Aneurysms<disease> in different locations were identified using available imaging studies. Aneurysms<disease> were defined according to location: thoracic ascending aorta ≥ 42 mm , descending ≥ 33 mm , abdominal aorta ≥ 30 mm , common iliac artery ≥ 20 mm or 50 % wider than the contralateral artery , common femoral artery ≥ 12 mm , popliteal artery ≥ 10 mm. A total of 339 women with an AAA were included. The median follow up was 2.8 ( range 0-15.7) years. Thirty-one per cent had an aneurysm<disease> in the thoracic aorta ( 67 of 217 investigated , 84 % were located in the descending aorta) , 13 ( 19 %) underwent repair. Twelve per cent had a common iliac artery aneurysm<disease> ( 24/259 , 76 % were investigated). Common femoral artery aneurysms<disease> were identified in 4.3 % ( 8/184 , 54 % investigated). Popliteal artery aneurysms<disease> were identified in 4.0 % ( 6/149 , 44 % investigated). The prevalence of infrainguinal aneurysms<disease> was higher among patients with synchronous iliac aneurysms<disease> ( 40 % vs. 1.6 % , OR 42 , 95 % CI 6.4-279 , p < .001). Thoracic aortic<disease> aneurysms<disease> are common among women with AAA , most commonly affecting the descending aorta , and detection frequently results in repair. Popliteal and femoral aneurysms<disease> are not rare among women with AAA , and even common if there is a synchronous iliac aneurysm<disease>.
