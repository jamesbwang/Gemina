 Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia accompanied by impaired vascular and endothelial function. Activation of ATP-sensitive potassium ( K Rats were divided into three groups: control , STZ ( 65 mg/kg , ip) and STZ + KMUP-1 ( 5 or 10 mg/kg/day , ip). MA reactivity was measured by dual wire myograph. MA smooth muscle cells ( MASMCs) were enzymatically dissociated and the K STZ decreased MA K KMUP-1 prevents STZ impairment of MA reactivity , eNOS levels and K
