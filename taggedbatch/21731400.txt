 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of patient head size on radiation dose to radiosensitive organs , such as the eye lens , brain and spinal<disease> cord in fluoroscopically guided neuro-interventional procedures and CBCT scans of the head. The Toshiba Infinix C-Arm System was modeled in BEAMnrc/EGSnrc Monte-Carlo code and patient organ and effective doses were calculated in DOSxynrc/EGSnrc for CBCT and interventional procedures. X-ray projections from different angles , CBCT scans , and neuro-interventional procedures were simulated on a computational head phantom for the range of head sizes in the adult population and for different pediatric ages. The difference of left-eye lens dose between the mean head size and the mean ± 1 standard deviation ( SD) ranges from 20 % to 300 % for projection angles of 0 ° to 90 ° RAO. The differences for other organs do not vary as much and is only about 10 % for the brain. For a LCI-High CBCT protocol , the difference between mean and mean ± 1 SD head size is about 100 % for lens dose and only 10 % for mean and peak brain dose; the difference between 20 and 3 year-old mean head size is an increase of about 200 % for the eye lens dose and only 30 % for mean and peak brain dose. Dose for all organs increases with decreasing head size for the same reference point air kerma. These results will allow size-specific dose estimates to be made using software such as our dose tracking system ( DTS).
