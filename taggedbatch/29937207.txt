 Percutaneous paravalvular leak ( PVL) closure has emerged as a palliative alternative to surgical management in selected high-risk patients. Percutaneous procedures are challenging , especially for mitral PVL. Accurate imaging of the morphologies of the defects is mandatory , together with precise guidance in the catheterization laboratory to enhance success rates. To describe imaging modalities used in clinical practice to guide percutaneous PVL closure and assess the potential of new imaging tools. Data from the ` Fermeture de Fuite paraproth√©tique ' ( FFPP) register were used. The FFPP register is an international multi-institutional collaborative register started in 2017 with a retrospective and a prospective part. A descriptive analysis of multimodality imaging used to guide PVL closure in clinical practice was performed. Data from 173 procedures performed in 19 centres from three countries ( France , Belgium and Poland) were collected , which included eight cases of PVL following transcatheter valve replacement. Transoesophageal echocardiography was used in 167 cases ( 96.5 %) and 3D echocardiography in 87.4 % of cases. In one case , 3D-echocardiography was fused with fluoroscopy images in real time using echonavigator software. Details about multimodality imaging were available from a sample of 31 patients. Cardiac computed tomography ( CT) was performed before 10 of the procedures. In one case , fusion between preprocedural cardiac CT angiography data and fluoroscopy data was used. In two cases , a 3D model of the valve with PVL was printed. Echocardiography , particularly the 3D mode , is the cornerstone of PVL imaging. Other imaging modalities , such as cardiac CT and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging , may be of complementary interest. New techniques such as imaging fusion and printing may further facilitate the percutaneous approach of PVLs.
