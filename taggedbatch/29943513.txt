 The purpose of this study was to examine whether freeze-dried germinal vesicles ( GV) can be matured in vitro after being injected into enucleated fresh oocytes in pigs as an alternative method for conservation of genetic resources. Although no reduction of the size of GV ( p = .094) , resveratrol treatment significantly enhanced the survival rates following GV transfer ( GVT) ( p < .001). Supplementation with 100 or 200 mmol/L trehalose in freeze-drying medium significantly increased the proportions of GVs with intact nuclear membrane and DNA integrity compared with the control group. Following transfer of freeze-dried GVs into enucleated fresh oocytes , the proportion of reconstructed oocytes reached the metaphase-II stage ( 2.4 % ± 1.4 %) was significantly lower ( p < .05) than that of the in vitro matured control group ( 83.2 % ± 2.5 %) , it was comparable with the GVT control group ( 7.4 % ± 2.7 %). The rates of freeze-dried GVs with intact nuclear membrane and DNA stored at -20 °C for 5 days were significantly higher ( p < .05) than those at 4 °C and room temperature. The rates of intact nuclear membrane and DNA in the freeze-dried GV stored for 15 or 30 days at -20 , 4 °C and RT were not significantly different. In conclusion , matured oocytes were produced derived from freeze-dried GVs.
