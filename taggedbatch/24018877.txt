 Hysterectomy is the empirical treatment for female pelvic organ prolapse ( POP) without robust evidence to prove its efficacy. Uphold transvaginal mesh ( TVM) system is an innovated device with smaller area , superior anterior/apical support with single incision to treat POP. The prospective cohort study aims to evaluate Uphold TVM 's performance with or without concomitant hysterectomy. Inclusion criteria specify patients suffering from stage 2 or more anterior/apical prolapse without previous hysterectomy. Exclusion criteria specify those with contraindications to uterine preservation , such as leiomyomas , adenomyosis , endometrial hyperplasia<disease> , abnormal uterine bleeding , postmenopausal bleeding , cervical dysplasia , receiving tamoxifen treatment , family history of gynecology cancer , or colon cancer and incapability to be routinely followed. Thirty patients are recruited in the hysterectomy group and 66 patients in the hysteropexy group. The results demonstrate that patients with Uphold mesh only experience longer vaginal length , shorter operation duration , less blood<symptom> loss<symptom> and less post-operation pain. The performance in anatomical correction , lower urinary<disease> tract symptoms improvement , de novo dyspareunia , urodynamic study parameters and mesh extrusion rates are comparable with or without uterus preservation. The information is useful in pre-operation counseling , when the patient can make an educated choice whether or not to receive concomitant hysterectomy.
