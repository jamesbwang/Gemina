 In dual-task situations , which often involve some form of sequential task processing , features of Task 2 were shown to affect Task 1 performance , a phenomenon termed `` backward crosstalk effect '' ( BCE). Most previous reports of BCEs are based on manipulations of code compatibility between tasks , while there is no clear picture whether and how mere Task 2 response selection difficulty ( in the absence of cross-task dimensional code overlap , including effector system overlap) may also affect Task 1 performance. In the present study , we systematically manipulated response-response ( R1-R2) relation ( compatible , incompatible , arbitrary) and the stimulus-response ( S-R) relation in Task 2 ( S2-R2: compatible , incompatible , arbitrary; i.e. , a classic manipulation of Task 2 response selection difficulty) to study the impact of dimensional overlap and compatibility within and across tasks using an integrated stimulus for both a vocal Task 1 and a manual Task 2. Results revealed a replication of a classic ( spatial) R1-R2 compatibility BCE ( based on code compatibility) , demonstrating that our paradigm is principally suited to capture typical BCEs. Importantly , conditions involving a removal of dimensional code overlap between tasks still yielded an effect of mere Task 2 response selection difficulty on Task 1 performance. Both types of BCEs ( i.e. , BCEs based on code compatibility and BCEs based on Task 2 difficulty) could be assumed to be rooted in anticipation of response selection difficulty triggered by stimuli indicating either R1-R2 or S2-R2 incompatibility. The results are in line with recent theoretical claims that anticipations of response characteristics ( or effects) play an important role for BCEs in particular and for conflict resolution in action control in general.
