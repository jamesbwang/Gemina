 Stem cell therapy has the potential to regenerate cardiac function after myocardial infarction. In this study , we sought to examine if fibrin microthread technology could be leveraged to develop a contractile fiber from human pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes ( hPS-CM). hPS-CM seeded onto fibrin microthreads were able to adhere to the microthread and began to contract seven days after initial seeding. A digital speckle tracking algorithm was applied to high speed video data ( > 60 fps) to determine contraction behaviour including beat frequency , average and maximum contractile strain , and the principal angle of contraction of hPS-CM contracting on the microthreads over 21 days. At day 7 , cells seeded on tissue culture plastic beat at 0.83 ± 0.25 beats/sec with an average contractile strain of 4.23 ± 0.23 % , which was significantly different from a beat frequency of 1.11 ± 0.45 beats/sec and an average contractile strain of 3.08 ± 0.19 % at day 21 (
