 To analyze the effects of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha ( HIF-1α)/ vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) signaling pathway on villous angiogenesis in early missed abortion<disease><symptom>. Immunohistochemical assays were performed to detect the expression of micro-vessel density ( MVD) , HIF-1α , and VEGF in villous tissue samples from 30 missed abortions<disease><symptom> and 30 elective abortions<disease><symptom> in early pregnancy. We further analyzed the correlation between HIF-1α/ VEGF and MVD. HTR8/SVneo cells were cultured under hypoxic ( 1 %) or normoxic ( 20 %) conditions , tube formation was investigated , and protein and mRNA level of HIF-1α/ VEGF were determined using western blot and qRT-PCR. Finally , HIF-1α was knocked down with siRNA introduced into HTR8/SVneo cell line under hypoxia , and HIF-1α/ VEGF expression and HTR8/SVneo tube formation were investigated. The expression of HIF-1α , VEGF , and MVD was lower in the missed abortion<disease><symptom> than in the elective abortion<disease><symptom> group. Correlational analysis showed that the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF was positively correlated with MVD in both groups. The levels of HIF-1α/ VEGF mRNA and protein in HTR8/SVneo cells were significantly enhanced under hypoxia. HIF-1α knockdown with siRNA inhibited HIF-1α/ VEGF mRNA and protein levels of HTR8/SVneo cells induced by hypoxia. Tube formation of HTR8/SVneo cells was significantly enhanced in hypoxic culture and was inhibited by HIF-1α knockdown with siRNA. Our results reveal a novel role for HIF-1α/ VEGF in regulating villous angiogenesis in early pregnancy and suggest that it may be a novel biomarker for missed abortion<disease><symptom>.
