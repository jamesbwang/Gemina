 To describe the laparoscopic transection of restrictive bands of the mesosalpinx as a useful adjunct to the topical application of prostaglandin E A standard left flank laparoscopic approach was made to the abdomen using three laparoscopic portals. If restrictive bands of the mesosalpinx were observed traversing the uterine tube perpendicularly , they were carefully transected and 1 mg of prostaglandin E Nine Thoroughbred mares suspected of uterine tubal blockage were treated. The treated mares had been barren for 1.8 years on average ( range: 1-5 years). The overall postoperative conception rate in treated mares was 89 % ( 8/9 mares). The mean number of mated oestrus cycles before pregnancy in the eight mares that conceived was 1.9 ± 1.6. These mares had been bred on average 6.2 ± 1.9 cycles without becoming pregnant prior to surgery. Transection of restrictive bands of the mesosalpinx is easily performed as an adjunctive procedure to laparoscopic-guided application of prostaglandin E
