 CD157/BST1 glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein is an evolutionary conserved dual-function receptor and β-NAD +- metabolizing ectoenzyme of the ADP-ribosyl cyclases gene family. Identified as bone<disease> marrow stromal cell and myeloid cell differentiation antigen , CD157 turned out to have a wider expression than originally assumed. The functional significance of human CD157 as an enzyme remains unclear , while it was well established in mouse models. Conversely , the receptor role of CD157 has been clearly delineated. In physiological conditions , CD157 is a key player in regulating leukocyte adhesion , migration and diapedesis. Underlying these functional roles is the ability of CD157 to bind with high affinity selected extracellular matrix components within their heparin-binding domains. CD157 binding to extracellular matrix promotes its interaction with β1 and β2-integrins and induces the organization of a multimolecular complex that is instrumental to the delivery of synergistic outside-in signals leading to optimal cell adhesion and migration , both in physiological and in pathological situations. CD157 also regulates cell adhesion and migration and is a marker of adverse prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer and pleural mesothelioma. This review focuses on human CD157 expression and functions and provides an overview on its role in human pathology and its emerging potential as target for antibody-mediated immunotherapy.
