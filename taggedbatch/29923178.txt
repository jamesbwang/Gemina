 To explore whether psilocybin with psychological support modulates personality parameters in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression<symptom> ( TRD). Twenty patients with moderate or severe , unipolar , TRD received oral psilocybin ( 10 and 25 mg , one week apart) in a supportive setting. Personality was assessed at baseline and at 3-month follow-up using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory ( NEO-PI-R) , the subjective psilocybin experience with Altered State of Consciousness<symptom> ( ASC) scale , and depressive symptoms with QIDS-SR16. Neuroticism scores significantly decreased while Extraversion increased following psilocybin therapy. These changes were in the direction of the normative NEO-PI-R data and were both predicted , in an exploratory analysis , by the degree of insightfulness experienced during the psilocybin session. Openness scores also significantly increased following psilocybin , whereas Conscientiousness showed trend-level increases , and Agreeableness did not change. Our observation of changes in personality measures after psilocybin therapy was mostly consistent with reports of personality change in relation to conventional antidepressant treatment , although the pronounced increases in Extraversion and Openness might constitute an effect more specific to psychedelic therapy. This needs further exploration in future controlled studies , as do the brain mechanisms of postpsychedelic personality change.
