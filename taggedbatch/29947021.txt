 Understanding the compaction behaviour of the primary powder in the roller compaction process is necessary to be able to better control the quality of the product. In this study , the plastic deformation of the primary particles was evaluated by determining two mechanical properties: the nano-indentation hardness and the viscoelasticity of the primary powder. The nano-indentation hardness of eight different materials with a wide range of mechanical properties was determined by indenting the surface of the single primary particle , whereas the viscoelasticity was evaluated for a powder bed using the creep test. These were linked to fundamental ribbon properties such as ribbon strength and width in addition to the amount of fines. It was identified that the plastic deformation of the material had the potential to provide an indication for the ability of the primary powder to produce a good ribbon. For the range of the investigated process parameters , the optimum hardness range that produced ribbons with ideal properties and small amount of fines was suggested.
