 A new periodontitis<disease> classification scheme has been adopted , in which forms of the disease previously recognized as `` chronic '' or `` aggressive '' are now grouped under a single category ( `` periodontitis<disease> '') and are further characterized based on a multi-dimensional staging and grading system. Staging is largely dependent upon the severity of disease at presentation as well as on the complexity of disease management , while grading provides supplemental information about biological features of the disease including a history-based analysis of the rate of periodontitis<disease> progression; assessment of the risk for further progression; analysis of possible poor outcomes of treatment; and assessment of the risk that the disease or its treatment may negatively affect the general health of the patient. Necrotizing periodontal<disease> diseases<disease> , whose characteristic clinical phenotype includes typical features ( papilla necrosis<symptom> , bleeding , and pain) and are associated with host immune response impairments , remain a distinct periodontitis<disease> category. Endodontic-periodontal lesions<symptom> , defined by a pathological communication between the pulpal and periodontal tissues at a given tooth , occur in either an acute or a chronic form , and are classified according to signs and symptoms that have direct impact on their prognosis and treatment. Periodontal abscesses<symptom> are defined as acute<symptom> lesions<symptom> characterized by localized accumulation of pus within the gingival wall of the periodontal pocket/sulcus , rapid tissue destruction and are associated with risk for systemic dissemination.
