 Under the immune pressure of cytotoxic T-cells ( CTLs) , Hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) evolves to accumulate mutations more likely within epitopes to evade immune detection. However , little is known about the specific patterns of the immune pressure-associated HBV mutation of T-cell epitopes and their linking to the disease progression. Here , we observed a correlation of the accumulated variants on HBV<pathogen> core protein ( HBc) with the disease severity of HBV infection. Further analysis indicated that these substitutions majorly located within CD8
