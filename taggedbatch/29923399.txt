 One of the main challenges for the 21st century is to balance the increasing demand for high-quality proteins while mitigating environmental impacts. In particular , cropland-based production of protein-rich animal feed for livestock rearing results in large-scale agricultural land-expansion , nitrogen pollution , and greenhouse gas emissions. Here we propose and analyze the long-term potential of alternative animal feed supply routes based on industrial production of microbial proteins ( MP). Our analysis reveals that by 2050 , MP can replace , depending on socio-economic development and MP production pathways , between 10-19 % of conventional crop-based animal feed protein demand. As a result , global cropland area , global nitrogen losses from croplands and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions can be decreased by 6 % ( 0-13 %) , 8 % ( -3-8 %) , and 7 % ( -6-9 %) , respectively. Interestingly , the technology to industrially produce MP at competitive costs is directly accessible for implementation and has the potential to cause a major structural change in the agro-food system.
