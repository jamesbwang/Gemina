 Volume and intensity of exercise are the basic components of training loads , having a direct impact on adaptive patterns. Exercise volume during resistance training has been conventionally evaluated as a total number of repetitions performed in each set , regardless of the time and speed of performing individual exercises. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of varied tempos i.e. regular ( REG) 2/0/2/ 0 , medium ( MED) 5/0/3/ 0 and slow ( SLO) 6/0/4/ 0 during resistance exercise on training volume , based on the total number of performed repetitions ( REP
