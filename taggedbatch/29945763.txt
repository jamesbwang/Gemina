 To estimate the vaccine effectiveness ( VE) of quadrivalent influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccine , I conducted a test-negative case control study in children , based on the rapid influenza<pathogen><disease> diagnostic test ( RIDT) , during the 2016-2017 season. Overall , the adjusted VE was significant for any influenza<pathogen><disease> ( influenza<pathogen><disease> A<pathogen> + B); VE: 30.2 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 5.4-48.4) and influenza<pathogen><disease> B<pathogen>: 48.2 % ( 95 % CI: 11.3-69.7). The participants were divided into three age groups ( group A: 0-4 years old , group B: 5-9 years old , and group C: 10-15 years old); in group A , the adjusted VE of quadrivalent influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccine was significant for any influenza<pathogen><disease> ( A + B): 58.6 % ( 95 % CI: 28.8-76.0) , influenza<pathogen><disease> A<pathogen>: 53.9 % ( 95 % CI: 16.4-74.6) , and influenza<pathogen><disease> B<pathogen>: 78.6 % ( 95 % CI: 23.6-94.0). In both groups B and C , VE was not observed for any of the types of influenza<pathogen><disease>. In only group A , two doses of vaccines provided significantly better VE against any influenza<pathogen><disease> , as well as both influenzas<disease> A and B , than single-dose vaccines and cases in which vaccination was not administered. In conclusion , quadrivalent influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccine showed significant VE and dose-dependent VE against any influenza<pathogen><disease> and both influenzas<disease> A and B , in children aged 0-4 years during the 2016-2017 season. Both the VE and dose-dependent VE were almost not observed in older group. However , this may due to low rate of vaccination , particularly in children aged 10-15 years.
