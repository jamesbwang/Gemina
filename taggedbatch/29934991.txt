 Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) is associated with diminished cardiac function , and exercise tolerance. We sought to investigate the role of cardiac rehabilitation program ( CR) in patients with AF. The study included 2165 consecutive patients that participated in our CR program between the years 2009- 2015. All were evaluated by a standard exercise stress test ( EST) at baseline , and upon completion of at least 3 months of training. Participants were dichotomized according to baseline fitness and the degree of functional improvement. The combined primary end point was cardiac related hospitalization or all-cause mortality. A total of 292 patients had history of AF , with a mean age of 68 Â± 9 years old , 76 % of which were males. The median predicted baseline fitness of AF patients was significantly lower compared to non-AF patients ( 103 % vs 122 % , p < 0.001 , respectively). Prominent improvement was achieved in the majority of the patients in both groups ( 64 % among AF patients and 63 % among those without AF). Median improvement in fitness between stress tests was significantly higher in patients with AF ( 124 % vs. 110 % , p < 0.001 , respectively). Among AF patients , high baseline fitness was associated with a lower event rates ( HR 0.40; 95 % CI 0.23-0.70; p = 0.001). Moreover , prominent improvement during CR showed a protective effect ( HR 0.83; 95 % CI 0.69-0.99; p = 0.04). In patients with AF participating in CR program , low fitness levels at baseline EST are associated with increased risk of total mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization during long-term follow-up. Improvement on follow-up EST diminishes the risk. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
