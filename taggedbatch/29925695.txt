 Loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene causes the autosomal dominant condition , neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1). Children and adults with NF1 suffer from pathologies including benign and malignant tumors to cognitive deficits , seizures<symptom> , growth abnormalities , and peripheral neuropathies. NF1 encodes neurofibromin , a Ras-GTPase activating protein , and NF1 mutations result in hyperactivated Ras signaling in patients. Existing NF1 mutant mice mimic individual aspects of NF1 , but none comprehensively models the disease. We describe a potentially novel Yucatan miniswine model bearing a heterozygotic mutation in NF1 ( exon 42 deletion) orthologous to a mutation found in NF1 patients. NF1 +/ ex42del miniswine phenocopy the wide range of manifestations seen in NF1 patients , including caf√© au lait spots , neurofibromas , axillary freckling , and neurological defects in learning and memory. Molecular analyses verified reduced neurofibromin expression in swine NF1 +/ ex42del fibroblasts , as well as hyperactivation of Ras , as measured by increased expression of its downstream effectors , phosphorylated ERK1/2 , SIAH , and the checkpoint regulators p53 and p21. Consistent with altered<symptom> pain<symptom> signaling in NF1 , dysregulation of calcium and sodium channels was observed in dorsal root ganglia expressing mutant NF1. Thus , these NF1 +/ ex42del miniswine recapitulate the disease and provide a unique , much-needed tool to advance the study and treatment of NF1.
