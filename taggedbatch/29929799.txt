 A grant driven partnership among a west<disease> Texas university , Texas Workforce Commission 's College Credits for Heroes , and the Health Resources and Services Administration provided the funding needed to create a competency based education ( CBE) model for recognizing military veteran service training and experience. Through this model , we call Competency Assessment Placement ( CAP) , prior learning credits can be awarded for upper division nursing courses leading to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The process used by faculty to create this direct assessment method for awarding credit , performance data of Cohort I using the CAP , and our initial `` lessons learned '' are provided. Incorporating an on-going reflection of military veteran student learning needs , a persistent concern for improvement of the nursing program , as well as a frequent review of veteran educational benefit policies will continue as this CAP model provides beneficial outcomes for the students.
