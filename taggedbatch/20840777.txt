 This population-based study evaluated the overall ( OS) and cancer-specific survival ( CSS) benefit from palliative radiotherapy ( RT) in patients with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC). We queried The Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results ( SEER) database for the patients with unresectable ICC diagnosed from 1973 to 2013. Propensity score-matched analysis was performed to reduce the impact of the selection bias between the palliative RT group and the nonpalliative RT group. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate the survival outcome before and after propensity score matching. OS and CSS were compared between patients with and without palliative RT using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. A total of 4,027 of 15,803 patients diagnosed with ICC were included in this study. Of those , 847 ( 21 %) patients underwent palliative RT , whereas 3,180 ( 79 %) did not. In the unmatched population , patients treated with palliative RT had improved OS and CSS relative to those treated without palliative RT ( adjusted HR = 0.9065 , 95 % CI = 0.8360-0.982 , Palliative RT seems to improve the prognosis of patients with unresectable ICC.
