 Selenium ( Se) is an essential micronutrient in the diet of mammals and has an important role in the immune function. Selenium is a key element in selenoproteins involved in the in the maintenance of the antioxidant defense. Diet with selenium is beneficial for the treatment of diseases correlated with high levels of oxidative stress , also observed in the Chagas disease. Chagas disease is a neglected disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and several research groups are focused on the illness treatment. Immunomodulation of the infection using microelements is an important tool to avoid deleterious effects of the Chagas disease. Therefore , our objective was to evaluate the effects of selenium supplementation on pregnant Wistar rats infected with T. cruzi. Selenium treatment stimulated the weight and length of fetuses and placentas allied to the decrease of blood parasitemia. However , selenium demonstrated a low influence on T cells , diminishing the B cell population ( CD45RA
