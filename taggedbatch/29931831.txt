 We report successful utilization of sequential alkene isomerization and ring-closing metathesis of dec-9-enoic acid based dienes in synthesis of macrocyclic lactones that possess a strong scent of musk. This catalytic sequence was essential to trim the chain length of starting dienes to yield macrocycles of the right size. Dec-9-enoic acid is conveniently obtainable from oleic esters by Ru-catalysed ethenolysis.
