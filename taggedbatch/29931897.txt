 To investigate the effects of mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs) inhibitors on glutathione ( GSH) metabolism , and to explore the pathway related to GSH metabolism. BRL rat hepatocytes were treated by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase ( JNK) , p38 , and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( ERK1/2) inhibitors: SP600125 , SB203580 and PD98659 , respectively , for 24 h. MTT method was used to measure hepatocytes viability. The content of GSH was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The protein expressions of JNK and phosphorylated JNK ( p-JNK) was tested by Luminex method. Activities of GSH metabolic enzymes were detected by commercial kits. Hepatocytes vitality was inhibited when the concentrations of SP600125 , SB203580 and PD98659 were higher than 10 JNK MAPK pathway takes part in the GSH metabolism in hepatocytes.
