 The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR) has been considered as an inflammatory marker in various disorders , but it is not clear whether the NLR is also elevated with hidden diabetes ( HD) , which is normal in fasting blood glucose ( FBG) but abnormal in the oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT). An HD animal model for 27 days and an animal model with oscillating glucose ( OG) for 7 days were applied on adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. OGTT , leukogram analysis , histology , and immunohistochemistry were carried out. In HD rats , the percentage of neutrophils increased but the percentage of lymphocytes decreased; hence , the NLR rose relative to sham. This may be a result of the OG levels often experienced by diabetic subjects , as normal rats given OG ( 6 g/kg/6 h) for 7 days had significantly reduced lymphocyte<symptom> numbers and increased NLR compared with the values before and 1 h after oral glucose administration during OGTT. Glucose-induced disarrangement of partitions of circulating immune cells and NLR was involved in the increase in oxidative stress , as these changes were totally blocked by the antioxidant glutathione ( GSH). GSH ( 50 mg/kg/6 h) totally blocked the glucose-induced alterations in lymphocyte<symptom> and NLR values. HD associated with elevation of NLR values may be partly attributed to a homeostasis disorder of the innate inflammatory state , caused by oscillating hyperglycemia. Acute high glucose administration produced a significant decrease in lymphocyte<symptom> number. OG administration potentiated this effect and increased the NLR value , which was blocked by GSH , suggesting that reactive oxygen species play a critical role in maintaining lymphocyte<symptom> numbers.
