 The aim of this study was to investigate OCB among physicians in China and explore whether their job satisfaction mediates the association between doctor-patient relationship ( DPR) and organizational citizenship behavior ( OCB). This cross-sectional , questionnaire-based survey was conducted among 1400 physicians in Shaanxi , China in 2014. The subjects were selected using a multi-stage cluster sampling methodology. The self-administered questionnaires included OCB Scale , DDPRQ , and PJSQ. Hierarchical linear regression analysis was used to estimate the effects of job satisfaction on the association between DPR and OCB. DPR negatively predicted four dimensions of OCB , including conscientiousness , sportsmanship , civic virtue , and altruism. DPR was negatively related to five job satisfaction dimensions , namely work satisfaction ( WS) , promotion satisfaction ( PS) , reward satisfaction ( RS) , supervision satisfaction ( SS) , and environment satisfaction ( ES). WS was positively correlated with conscientiousness and civic virtue; PS and SS were positively related to all four OCB dimensions; RS was positively related with civic virtue and altruism , and ES was positively correlated with conscientiousness and civic virtue. WS and PS partially mediated the association between DPR and conscientiousness; PS and SS partially mediated the relation between DPR and sportsmanship; PS , SS , and ES mediated the association between DPR and civic virtue; and PS , RS and SS partially mediated the relation between DPR and altruism. Job satisfaction mediated the association between DPR and OCB among Chinese physicians. The poor DPR possibly reduce physicians ' job satisfaction , thereby causing a decline of OCB in hospitals. Therefore , DPR improvement and job satisfaction have a great potential to promote physicians ' job performance in China.
