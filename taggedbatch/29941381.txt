 Controversy remains regarding the outcomes after total joint arthroplasty ( TJA) among patients with or without liver transplantation ( LT). This study aimed at investigating the prevalence of TJA in patients after LT and comparing the morbidity and mortality with the non-LT group. We conducted a nationwide , population-based study , with data extracted from a universal health insurance database , based on the International Classification of Disease , Ninth Revision , Clinical Modification. Patients who underwent TJAs between January 2001 and December 2014 were included. Patients who had bilateral TJAs or a TJA before LT were excluded. A total of 43 patients with LT and 350,337 patients without LT were included. The analysis was implemented using data from all patients and those matched by 1-to-10 propensity score matching. Multivariable logistic regression was used to control confounding variables. The prevalence of patients undergoing TJA after LT was 1.3 % ( 43/3276). After propensity score matching , patients with LT were not associated with 30-day complications ( adjusted odds ratio ( aOR) , 0.98; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.93-1.03; P = .35) , 30-day readmission rates ( aOR , 0.93; 95 % CI , 0.92-1.08; P = .87) , 90-day complication rates ( aOR , 0.95; 95 % CI , 0.88-1.02; P = .16) , 1-year infection rates ( aOR , 1.04; 95 % CI , 0.96-1.12; P = .35) , reoperation rates ( aOR , 1.06; 95 % CI , 0.92-1.23; P = .41) , or mortality ( aOR , 0.91; 95 % CI , 0.80-1.04; P = .18). The morbidity and mortality seem to be comparable whether TJA is performed in patients with or without LT. Methods for risk assessment would be feasible in liver transplant recipients.
