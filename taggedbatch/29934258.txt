 It is unknown whether cervical lymphadenectomy as a treatment for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( cSCCh & n) increases survival in elderly patients. The aim of this study is to determine whether this procedure has an influence on the survival of these patients , and whether the Short-Form Charlson Comorbidity Index ( CCI-SF) can be used as an alternative to age in the surgeon 's estimation of elderly patient mortality. The study population included all patients diagnosed with cSCCh & n consecutively treated between 2006 and 2011. Non-invasive , non-cutaneous carcinomas were excluded. Patients were grouped according to their age ( < 70 , 70-79 , 80-89 , > 90) , CCI-SF ( < 3 , â‰¥ 3) and presence ( N1) or absence ( N0) of cervical metastases. The dependent variable was the performance or not of cervical lymphadenectomy. A univariate survival analysis was performed according to the presence of metastases , a bivariate analysis for each of the independent variables according to the received treatment and a multivariate analysis. 416 cases were included. The mean survival time was greater in the N0 group. For each of the groups based on the presence of metastasis , the differences in the mean survival time according to age and CCI-SF were not significant , regardless of the treatment received. The multivariate analysis showed the influence of age ( p = 0.0001 , OR = 1.488 , 95 % CI = ( 1.318; 1.679)) and CCI-SF ( p = 0.001 , OR = 1.817 , 95 % CI = ( 1.257; 2.627)) in the N0 group. In the N1 group only regional treatment has a positive influence on survival ( p = 0.048 , OR = 0.15 , 95 % CI = ( 0.023; 0.981)). CCI-SF and age are good mortality indicators in cSCCh & n N0 patients , but not so in cSCCh & n N1 patients. In cSCCh & n N1 patients , regional treatment has a positive influence on survival. Differences can not be affirmed in the mean survival time of patients with cSCCh & n , based on the development of metastases and the treatment given. New studies will be necessary.
