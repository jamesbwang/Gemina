 Objective This study was performed to evaluate the test-retest reliability of perfusion of the cortex and subcortical white matter on three-dimensional spiral fast spin echo pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling ( 3D-ASL). Methods Eight healthy subjects underwent 3D-ASL and structural imaging at the same time each day for 1 week. ASL data acquisition was performed in the resting state and right finger-tapping state. Cerebral blood flow ( CBF) images were calculated , and the CBF values of the precentral cortex ( PCC) and precentral subcortical white matter ( PCSWM) were automatically extracted based on the structural images and CBF images. Results In the resting state , the intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC) of the bilateral PCC was 0.84 ( left) and 0.81 ( right) and that of the bilateral SCWM was 0.89 ( left) and 0.85 ( right). In the finger-tapping state , the ICC of the bilateral PCC was 0.91 ( left) and 0.87 ( right) and that of the bilateral PCSWM was 0.87 ( left) and 0.92 ( right). The CBF value of the left PCC and PCSWM was not significantly different between the resting state and finger-tapping state on two ASL scans. Conclusion 3D-ASL provides reliable CBF measurement in the cortex and subcortical white matter in the resting or controlled state.
