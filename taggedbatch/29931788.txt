 Ras-association domain family 6 ( RASSF6) is a tumor suppressor that interacts with MDM2 and stabilizes p53. Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> unc-119 encodes a protein that is required for normal development of the nervous system. Humans have 2 unc-119 homologues , UNC119 and UNC119B. We have identified UNC119 as a RASSF6-interacting protein. UNC119 promotes the interaction between RASSF6 and MDM2 and stabilizes p53. Thus , UNC119 induces apoptosis by RASSF6 and p53. UNC119 depletion impairs DNA repair after DNA damage and results in polyploid cell generation. These findings support that UNC119 is a regulator of the RASSF6-MDM2-p53 axis and functions as a tumor suppressor.
