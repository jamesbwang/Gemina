 Study Design Prospective , cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study. Background Small nerve fiber degeneration ( SFD) commonly occurs in patients with peripheral neuropathies , resulting in deterioration in nerve function. Currently , the gold standard to identify SFD is through skin biopsies. Simple clinical tests aim to identify SFD , but their validity remains unknown. Objectives To examine the validity of clinical tests to assess SFD using carpal tunnel syndrome<disease><symptom> ( CTS) as a model system. Methods 107 participants ( 22 healthy , 85 with CTS) underwent pinprick testing over the index finger , and had cold and warm detection thresholds taken ( CDT , WDT) using quantitative sensory testing ( QST). In a sub-group of patients with CTS ( n = 51) , cold and warm sensation were also tested using coins at room and body temperature respectively. The validity of these clinical tests was established against intra-epidermal nerve fiber density ( IENFD) measured in skin biopsies from the index finger. Results Optimal validity occurred with clusters of tests: normal warm OR cold sensation is highly sensitive to rule out SFD ( sensitivity 0.98 , 95 % CI 0.85,0.99) , but has a low specificity ( 0.2 , 95 % CI 0.03,0.52). A reduction in pinprick in contrast is highly specific ( 0.88 , 95 % CI 0.72,0.95) , thus useful to rule in SFD. For QST , highest specificity ( 0.77) occurred for WDT and highest sensitivity ( 0.84 , 95 % CI , 0.72,0.91) for CDT OR WDT. Conclusion Pin prick testing followed by warm and cold tests if pin prick is normal , is a valid and cost-effective method to detect SFD. For QST , WDT is useful for ruling in SFD. To rule out SFD both CDT and WDT must be negative. Level of Evidence Diagnosis , Level 2. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther , Epub 22 Jun 2018. doi: 10.2519/ jospt .2018.8230.
