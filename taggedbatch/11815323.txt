 Malnutrition , a very common condition in the elderly , is known to increase their vulnerability to adverse health events. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of malnutrition in the over 75-yr-old community-dwelling population in the `` Chiavarese '' Local Health Unit district ( North West Italy). The short version of the Mini<pathogen> Nutritional Assessment ( MNA-SF) was used by General Practitioners ( GP) as a screening tool to investigate the nutritional status of elderly people ( 1039 subjects). The study was conducted in 2012-2013 in the Local Health Unit of Chiavari ( Liguria Region) , Italy. The malnutrition was subsequently confirmed by means of biochemical parameters. Subjects at risk of malnutrition or malnourished ( n = 22) received personalized dietary counseling by the GP. The MNA-SF recognized 21 % of the elderly people being at risk of malnutrition and biochemical tests confirmed a malnutrition prevalence of 3.5 %. The dietary counseling improved the MNA-SF score and biochemical parameters , but the difference was statistically significant only for the MNA-SF score ( Malnutrition can be evaluated with a simple tool such as the MNA-SF , recognized at the earliest stage and successfully treated by the GP.
