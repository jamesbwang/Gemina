 Evoked potentials ( EPs) are well established in clinical practice for diagnosis and prognosis in multiple sclerosis ( MS). However , their value is limited to the assessment of their respective functional systems. Here , we used transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS) coupled with electroencephalography ( TMS-EEG) to investigate cortical excitability and spatiotemporal dynamics of TMS-evoked neural activity in MS patients. Thirteen patients with early relapsing-remitting MS ( RRMS) with a median Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS) of 1.0 ( range 0-2.5) and 16 age- and gender-matched healthy controls received single-pulse TMS of left and right primary motor cortex ( L-M1 and R-M1) , respectively. Resting motor threshold for L-M1 and R-M1 was increased in MS patients. Latencies and amplitudes of N45 , P70 , N100 , P180 , and N280 TMS-evoked EEG potentials ( TEPs) were not different between groups , except a significantly increased amplitude of the N280 TEP in the MS group , both for L-M1 and R-M1 stimulation. Interhemispheric signal propagation ( ISP) , estimated from the area under the curve of TEPs in the non-stimulated vs. stimulated M1 , also did not differ between groups. In summary , findings show that ISP and TEPs were preserved in early-stage RRMS , except for an exaggerated N280 amplitude. Our findings indicate that TMS-EEG is feasible in testing excitability and connectivity in cortical neural networks in MS patients , complementary to conventional EPs. However , relevance and pathophysiological correlates of the enhanced N280 will need further study.
