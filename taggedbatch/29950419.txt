 The flexible regulation of cellular metabolic pathways enables cellular adaptation to changes in energy demand under conditions of stress such as posed by a virus infection. To analyze such an impact on cellular metabolism , rubella<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( RV<pathogen>) was used in this study. RV<pathogen> replication under selected substrate supplementation with glucose , pyruvate , and glutamine as essential nutrients for mammalian cells revealed its requirement for glutamine. The assessment of the mitochondrial respiratory<pathogen><symptom> ( based on oxygen consumption rate , OCR) and glycolytic ( based on extracellular acidification rate , ECAR) rate and capacity by respective stress tests through Seahorse technology enabled determination of the bioenergetic phenotype of RV-infected cells. Irrespective of the cellular metabolic background , RV<pathogen> infection induced a shift of the bioenergetic state of epithelial ( Vero and A549) and endothelial ( HUVEC) cells to a higher oxidative and glycolytic level. Interestingly there was a RV<pathogen> strain-specific , but genotype-independent demand for glutamine to induce a significant increase in metabolic activity. While glutaminolysis appeared to be rather negligible for RV<pathogen> replication , glutamine could serve as donor of its amide nitrogen in biosynthesis pathways for important metabolites. This study suggests that the capacity of rubella<pathogen> viruses to induce metabolic alterations could evolve differently during natural infection. Thus , changes in cellular bioenergetics represent an important component of virus-host interactions and could complement our understanding of the viral preference for a distinct host cell population.
