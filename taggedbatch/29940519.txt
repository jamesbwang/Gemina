 Several modifiable lifestyle indicators , including diet , smoking , alcohol consumption , weight and physical activity have been associated with depression<symptom>; however , their combined effect has been less studied. The aim of this study was to calculate a Healthy Lifestyle Index ( HLI) composed of the 5 above-mentioned indicators and investigate its association with incident depressive symptoms. The study sample consisted of 25,837 participants from the NutriNet-Sant√© study , initially free of depressive symptoms. The HLI was computed by assigning 1 point to each lifestyle indicator namely healthy diet , healthy weight , moderate or high physical activity , never smoking and low alcohol consumption. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression<symptom> Scale ( CES-D). Hazard Ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models and population attributable risks ( PAR) were calculated. A total of 2112 incident cases of depressive symptoms were identified over a mean follow-up of 5 years. After accounting for a wide range of potential confounders , a 1-point increase in the HLI was associated with a 10 % ( 95 % CI 6 %; 13 %) reduction in the risk of depressive symptoms. The estimated PAR representing the proportion of cases that are attributable to non-adherence to specific healthy lifestyle indicators were 8 % for healthy diet , 5 % for healthy weight , 5 % for non-smoking and 14 % for the non-adherence to a combination of healthy diet , healthy weight and non-smoking. Some unmeasured factors related to both depression<symptom> and lifestyle indicators , such as family history of depressive disorder , stressful life events , and sleep disorders might have led to potential residual confounding. Modifying unhealthy lifestyles , especially diet , weight and smoking , is a potential target of major interest in the prevention of depressive symptoms in adults.
