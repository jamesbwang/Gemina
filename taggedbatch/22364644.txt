 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of a gas-phase fluorination method under different fluorination periods through using two resin cements. 84 zirconia specimens in dimensions of 5 mm × 5 mm × 2 mm were prepared and surface treated with 50 µm aluminum oxide particles or gas phase fluorination for 2 min , 5 min , or 10 min. One specimen in each group was surface analyzed under scanning electron microscope. The remaining specimens were bonded to composite cylinders in dimensions of 2 mm diameter and 3 mm high with Panavia SA Plus or Variolink N. Then , the specimens were stored in 37 ℃ distilled water for 24 hours and shear bond strength test was applied at a speed of 1 mm/min. The highest shear bond strength values were observed in the samples fluorinated for 5 minutes and cemented with Panavia SA Plus. Variolink N did not elicit any statistical differences between surface treatments. Panavia SA Plus resin cement and Variolink N resin cements featured statistically significant difference in shear bond strength values only in the case of 5 minutes of fluorination treatment. According to the results of this study , application of 5 minutes of fluorination with 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate monomer ( MDP) containing Panavia SA Plus resin cement increased the resin bond strength of zirconia. Fluorination of the zirconia surface using conventional resin cement , Variolink N , did not lead to an increase in bond strength.
