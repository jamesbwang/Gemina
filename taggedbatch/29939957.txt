 We present a case of metastatic meningioma detected on Ga-DOTA-octreotate PET. A 52-year-old woman presented with multiply recurrent multifocal meningioma. A staging Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT demonstrated focal radiotracer uptake within the known intracranial meningiomas. In addition , a DOTATATE-avid mass was found in the liver that was biopsied , confirming metastatic meningioma. This report suggests that Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT should be considered whenever screening meningioma patients for metastases.
