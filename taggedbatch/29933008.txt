 Traumatic brain injury ( TBI) is a risk factor for development of chronic neurodegenerative disorders later in life. This review summarizes the current knowledge and concepts regarding the connection between long-term consequences of TBI and aging-associated neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) , chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE) , and Parkinsonism , with implications for novel therapy targets. Several aggregation-prone proteins such as the amyloid-beta ( Aβ) peptides , tau proteins , and α-synuclein protein are involved in secondary pathogenic cascades initiated by a TBI and are also major building blocks of the hallmark pathological lesions<symptom> in chronic human neurodegenerative diseases with dementia. Impaired metabolism and degradation pathways of aggregation-prone proteins are discussed as potentially critical links between the long-term aftermath of TBI and chronic neurodegeneration. Utility and limitations of previous and current preclinical TBI models designed to study the link between TBI and chronic neurodegeneration , and promising intervention pharmacotherapies and non-pharmacologic strategies to break this link , are also summarized. Complexity of long-term neuropathological consequences of TBI is discussed , with a goal of guiding future preclinical studies and accelerating implementation of promising therapeutics into clinical trials.
