 Early identification of sepsis<disease> is critical as early treatment improves outcomes. We sought to identify threshold values of secretory phospholipase A2 ( sPLA2)- IIA that predict sepsis<disease> and bacterial infection compared to nonseptic controls in an emergency department ( ED) population. This is a prospective cohort of consenting adult patients who met two or more systemic inflammatory response syndrome<disease><symptom> ( SIRS) criteria with clinical diagnosis of infectious source likely ( septic patients). Controls were nonseptic consenting adults undergoing blood draw for other ED indications. Both groups had blood drawn , blind-coded , and sent to an outside laboratory for quantitative analysis of sPLA2-IIA levels. The study investigators reviewed patients ' inpatient medical record for laboratory , imaging , and microbiology results , as well as clinical course. sPLA2-IIA levels were significantly lower in control patients as compared to septic patients ( median = 0 ng/ml ( interquartile range ( IQR): 0-6.5) versus median = 123 ng/ml ( IQR 44-507.75); sPLA2-IIA shows potential as a biomarker distinguishing sepsis<disease> from other disease entities. Further study is warranted to identify predictive value of trends in sPLA-IIA during disease course in septic patients.
