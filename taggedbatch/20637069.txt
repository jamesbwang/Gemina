 Ulcerative colitis<disease> is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> involving the intestine. It is reported that about 40 % of patients with ulcerative colitis<disease> have extraintestinal manifestations , where as the literature on neurological involvement as extraintestinal manifestation is rather limited. Guillain-Barré syndrome<disease><symptom> is an abnormal immune-mediated and acute-acquired demyelinating disease that mainly affects the peripheral nervous system and often has a phenomenon of protein-cell separation of cerebrospinal fluid. Here , we report a rare case of ulcerative colitis<disease> with Guillain-Barré Syndrome<disease><symptom>. We described a patient with Guillain-Barré syndrome<disease><symptom> during the remission period of ulcerative colitis<disease>. Clinical manifestations are the numbness of the upper extremities , weakness<symptom> in the limbs and the inability of the fingers companion. Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) showed albuminocytological dissociation and electromyography suggested neurogenic lesion<symptom>. Ulcerative colitis<disease> with Guillain-Barré syndrome<disease><symptom> was diagnosed based on the history of ulcerative colitis<disease> , related symptoms , typical cerebrospinal fluid albuminocytological dissociation and evidence of neurogenic injury through electromyography. The patient was treated with intravenous ( IV) methylprednisolone. After the treatment of glucocorticoid , the symptoms of the nervous system were disappeared. Neurological involvement of extraintestinal manifestation during the remission period of ulcerative colitis<disease> also exists in the clinic. This case highlights the need for diagnostic vigilance in cases of ulcerative colitis<disease> involving the peripheral nerves during the remission period. We recommend cerebrospinal fluid examination and electromyography in view of rare but serious possibility of Guillain-Barré syndrome<disease><symptom>.
