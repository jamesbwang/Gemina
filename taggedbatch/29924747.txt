 Sebaceous neoplasms with an organoid pattern ( rippled , labyrinthine/sinusoidal , carcinoid-like , and petaloid) are rare. Previous studies suggested that the above patterns likely represent variations along a morphological continuum. The objectives of this study were to ( 1) validate this proposition by studying a large number of cases , ( 2) determine whether there are specific associations with clinical features , ( 3) establish their frequency , and ( 4) determine whether they have any association with Muir-Torre syndrome<disease><symptom>. Fifty-seven sebaceous neoplasms ( 54 sebaceomas and 3 sebaceous carcinomas) with organoid growth patterns were studied. These occurred in 36 men and 18 women ( sex unknown in 3) , with ages at diagnosis ranging from 22 to 89 years ( mean , 63 years). All patients presented with a solitary nodule<disease> ( mean size , 11 mm) on the head and neck area. Of the 57 tumors , 24 manifested a single growth pattern , 23 had a combination of 2 patterns , and 10 a combination of 3 patterns , indicating that these patterns are part of a morphological continuum of changes. The carcinoid-like pattern was the most frequent in the `` monopatterned '' neoplasms ( 13 cases) , whereas the labyrinthine/sinusoidal pattern comprised most of the `` polypatterned '' lesions<symptom> , in which various combinations occurred. Immunohistochemically , mismatch repair protein deficiency was detected in 3 of the 22 cases studied , whereas 5 of the 33 patients with available follow-up had an internal malignancy/premalignancy. In conclusion , sebaceous neoplasms with organoid growth patterns are predominantly sebaceomas having a predilection for the scalp , occurring as solitary lesions<symptom> in elderly patients ( male to female ratio of 2:1). Such patterns are expected to be found in a quarter of sebaceomas. In most cases , more than one of the organoid patterns is present. These lesions<symptom> do not appear to be associated with internal malignancy or mismatch repair deficiency in most cases. However , confirmation of the absence of any significant association with Muir-Torre syndrome<disease><symptom> syndrome<pathogen><disease><symptom> will require genetic studies.
