 Chloroalkenes are among the important anthropogenic organic compounds emitted in the atmosphere as a result of their wide use in synthetic processes in industry. Despite their well-known adverse effects on human health and air quality , the chemistry of these chloroalkenes remains poorly explored. In this work , reactions of 4-chloro-1-butene ( CBE) , a representative example of chloroalkenes , with O
