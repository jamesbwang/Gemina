 The landmark National Lung Screening Trial demonstrated significant reduction in lung cancer-related mortality. However , European lung cancer screening ( LCS) trials have not confirmed such benefit. We examined LCS patterns and determined the impact of LCS-led diagnosis on the mortality of newly diagnosed patients with lung cancer in an underserved community. Medical records of patients diagnosed with primary lung cancer in 2013 through 2016 ( n = 855) were reviewed for primary care provider ( PCP) status and LCS eligibility and completion , determined using United States Preventative Services Task Force guidelines. Univariate analyses of patient characteristics were conducted between LCS-eligible patients based on screening completion. Survival analyses were conducted using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression. In 2013 through 2016 , 175 patients with primary lung cancer had an established PCP and were eligible for LCS. Among them , 19 % ( 33/175) completed screening prior to diagnosis. LCS completion was associated with younger age ( P = .02) , active smoking status ( P < .01) , earlier stage at time of diagnosis ( P < .01) , follow-up in-network cancer treatment ( P = .03) , and surgical management ( P < .01). LCS-eligible patients who underwent screening had improved all-cause mortality compared with those not screened ( P < .01). Multivariate regression showed surgery ( hazard ratio , 0.31; P = .04) significantly affected mortality. To our knowledge , this is the first study to assess LCS patterns and mortality differences on patients with screen-detected lung cancer in an urban underserved setting since the inception of United States Preventative Services Task Force guidelines. Patients with a LCS-led diagnosis had improved mortality , likely owing to cancer detection at earlier stages with curative treatment , which echoes the finding of prospective trials.
