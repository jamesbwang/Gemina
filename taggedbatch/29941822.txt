 A surface plasmon resonance ( SPR) sensor based on a side-polished single mode fiber coated with polyvinyl alcohol ( PVA) is demonstrated for relative humidity ( RH) sensing. The SPR sensor exhibits a resonant dip in the transmission spectrum in ambient air after PVA film coating , and the resonant wavelength shifts to longer wavelengths as the thickness of the PVA film increases. When RH changes , the resonant dip of the sensor with different film-thicknesses exhibits interesting characteristics for optical spectrum evolution. For sensors with initial wavelengths between 550 nm and 750 nm , the resonant dip shifts to longer wavelengths with increasing RH. The averaged sensitivity increases firstly and then drops , and shows a maximal sensitivity of 1.01 nm/RH %. Once the initial wavelength of the SPR sensor exceeds 850 nm , an inflection point of the resonant wavelength shift can be observed with RH increasing , and the resonant dip shifts to shorter wavelengths for RH values exceeding this point , and sensitivity as high as & minus; 4.97 nm/RH % can be obtained in the experiment. The sensor is expected to have potential applications in highly sensitive and cost effective humidity sensing.
