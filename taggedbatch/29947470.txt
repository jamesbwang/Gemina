 Calculating pesticide residue levels in feed items for terrestrial species requires accounting for the application rate of the pesticide , the frequency and interval of application , the half-life of the pesticide on the food item , and the residue unit dose. MS Excel â„¢ based applications such as the US Environmental Protection Agency 's Terrestrial Residue Exposure model ( T-REX) and Terrestrial Herpetofaunal Exposure Residue Program ( T-HERPS) calculate the residue levels in feed items using a recursive sequence. A recursive sequence is an unwieldy calculation method that presents a barrier to creating a software-based tool capable of conducting flexible assessments. Therefore , we determined the closed form of the recursive mathematical equation used by both T-REX and T-HERPS. With this formula , we can both duplicate screening level assessments ( T-REX , T-HERPS) , as well as incrementally refine the assessment with data-driven inputs.
