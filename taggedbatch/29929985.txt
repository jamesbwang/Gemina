 Neutrophils are white blood cells that are mobilized to damaged tissues and to sites of pathogen invasion , providing the first line of host defense. Chemokines displayed on the surface of blood vessels promote migration of neutrophils to these sites , and tissue-and pathogen derived chemoattractant signals , including N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine ( fMLP) elicit further migration to sites of infection. Although nearly all chemoattractant receptors use heterotrimeric G proteins to transmit signals , many of the mechanisms lying downstream of chemoattractant receptors that either promote or limit neutrophil motility are incompletely defined. Here we show that Regulator of G protein signaling 5 ( RGS5) , a protein that modulates G protein activity , is expressed in both human and murine neutrophils. We detected significantly more neutrophils in the airways of Rgs5-/- mice than wild-type counterparts following acute<pathogen><disease><symptom> respiratory<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> infection and also in the peritoneum in response to injection of thioglycollate , a biochemical proinflammatory stimulus. RGS5-deficient neutrophils responded with increased chemotaxis elicited by the chemokines C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 ( CXCL1) , CXCL2 , and CXCL12 , but not fMLP. Moreover , adhesion of these cells was increased in the presence of both CXCL2 and fMLP. In summary , our results indicate that RGS5 deficiency increases chemotaxis and adhesion , leading to more efficient neutrophil mobilization to inflamed tissues in mice. These findings suggest that RGS5 expression and activity in neutrophils determine their migrational patterns in the complex microenvironments characteristic of inflamed tissues.
