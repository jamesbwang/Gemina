 Frequent allergens are known , but not whether allergens are enantiomer specific. Chemicals were tested on guinea pigs and humans to answer this question. Frullanoides showed evident allergic enantiospecificity , whereas the conclusion was shaded for α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone. A link between this chemical and chronic actinic dermatitis<disease> was proposed. No clear tendency to enantio-stereospecificity in inducing allergic contact dermatitis<disease> was ascertained. Future studies using contemporary analytical chemistry and new immunologic knowledge have to be undertaken to provide clearer mechanistic insights. This information may aid in attempts to decrease product allergenicity.
