 The gravity , scale , and nature of human rights violations are severe in North Korea. Little is known about the mental health consequences of the lifelong exposures to these violations. In 2014-2015 , a retrospective study was conducted among 383 North Korean refugees in South Korea using respondent-driven sampling to access this hidden population. This study collected information on the full range of political and economic rights violations and measured post-traumatic stress disorder , anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> symptoms , and social functioning by standard instruments. Multivariate regression analysis was performed with the adjustment of political , economic , and demographic variables in 2016-2017. The results indicate elevated symptoms of anxiety<symptom> ( 60.1 % , 95 % CI = 54.3 % , 65.7 %) , depression<symptom> ( 56.3 % , 95 % CI = 50.8 % , 61.9 %) , and post-traumatic stress disorder ( 22.8 % , 95 % CI = 18.6 % , 27.4 %) , which are significantly associated with exposures to political rights violations ( ten to 19 items versus non-exposure: anxiety<symptom> AOR = 16.78 , p < 0.001 , depression<symptom> AOR = 12.52 , p < 0.001 , post-traumatic stress disorder AOR = 16.71 , p < 0.05) , and economic rights violations ( seven to 13 items versus non-exposure: anxiety<symptom> AOR = 5.68 , p < 0.001 , depression<symptom> AOR = 4.23 , p < 0.01 , post-traumatic stress disorder AOR = 5.85 , p < 0.05). The mean score of social functioning was also lower in those who were exposed to political ( adjusted difference = -13.29 , p < 0.001) and economic rights violations ( adjusted difference = -11.20 , p < 0.001). This study highlights mental health consequences of lifelong human rights violations in North Korea. Beyond the conventional approach , it suggests the need for a collaborative preventive response from global health and human rights activists to address human rights in regard to mental health determinants of the 20 million people in North Korea.
