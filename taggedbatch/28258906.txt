 Type 2 diabetes may alter cardiac structure and function. Many patients with type 2 diabetes have diastolic dysfunction with preserved ejection fraction ( EF). Recently , this latter measure was criticised. Thus , this research looked at the impact of left ventricular end-diastolic volume and E/e ' ratio variations in patients with type 2 diabetes and preserved EF with the aim to recognise different clinical phenotypes. In this cross-sectional study , we evaluated 176 men affected by type 2 diabetes with transthoracic echocardiography. All subjects have preserved EF ( > 50 %). Patients were stratified into four groups based on the median value of both left ventricular end-diastolic volume and E/e ' ratio , and the clinical variables were registered. The independent predictors associated with the groups were analysed by a multinomial logistic regression model. Diabetes duration , age , estimated glomerular filtration rate and antihypertensive treatments were significantly different among the groups as were EF , left atrial volume index ( LAVI) , E/A , septum thickness and s ' mean wave. Multinomial regression analysis showed that the groups significantly differed for age , diabetes duration , EF , LAVI , septum thickness and s ' mean wave. The main result of this study was that patients with higher left ventricular volume and higher E/e ' ratio ( group 2) showed the worse clinical profile. Our study might suggest that variations of left ventricular end-diastolic volume along with E/e ' ratio variations , even in the normal range , may allow to recognise phenotypes of patients with type 2 diabetes with worse clinical characteristics. This finding should be tested in prospective studies to assess the predictive roles of these phenotypes.
