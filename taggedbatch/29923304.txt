 The HIV<pathogen> epidemic is worsening among men who have sex with men ( MSM) in China , especially among those who are younger than 25 years old ( younger MSM ( YMSM)). The aim of the study was to compare the prevalences of HIV<pathogen> incidence and recent HIV<pathogen> infection as well as factors associated with recent HIV<pathogen> infection in YMSM and older MSM ( OMSM). A multicentre cross-sectional survey was conducted among 4496 MSM recruited from seven Chinese cities. YMSM were defined as those aged < 25 years. Data on demographics and sexual behaviours were collected using structural questionnaires. Blood samples were tested for recent HIV<pathogen> infection and other sexually transmitted infections. Among the participants , 1313 were YMSM and 3183 were OMSM. Compared with OMSM , YMSM had a higher prevalence of recent HIV<pathogen> infection ( 5.4 % ( 71 of 1313) for YMSM vs. 3.6 % ( 115 of 3175) for OMSM; P = 0.006) and a higher HIV<pathogen> incidence ( 11.8 per 100 person-years ( PY) ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 9.0-14.5) for YMSM vs. 7.6 per 100 PY ( 95 % CI 6.3-9.0) for OMSM). The incidence increased with age among YMSM , especially between the ages of 16 and 21 years. In contrast , the incidence declined with age among OMSM. Anal bleeding , recreational drug use , syphilis<disease> and herpes<disease> simplex<pathogen><disease> virus 2 ( HSV-2) infection were independent risk factors for recent HIV<pathogen> infection among YMSM. The prevalence of all these risk factors increased with age between the ages of 16 and 21 years. Anal bleeding ( 19.8 %) and recreational drug use ( 19.5 %) had the highest adjusted population attributable fractions ( aPAFs) among YMSM. The highest aPAFs of anal bleeding ( 27.4 %) and syphilis<disease> infection ( 25.5 %) were found between the ages of 19 and 21 years. The HIV<pathogen> incidence in Chinese YMSM was significantly higher than that in OMSM. YMSM aged 16-21 years had an extremely high risk of recent HIV<pathogen> infection.
