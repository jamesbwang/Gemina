 Magnetic nanoparticles ( MNPs) with higher magnetization are highly desirable for targeted drug delivery ( TDD) systems , as it helps accumulation of drug at the target site. However , functionalization of MNPs for drug binding reduces the magnetization which affects the efficacy of TDD. Herein we report direct functionalization of MNPs with ( 3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane ( APTES) which preserves the magnetization. Grafting density estimated by TGA and BET analysis showed monolayer grafting of APTES on MNP surface. MNPs were comprehensively characterized by XRD , HR-TEM , SQUID-VSM and FTIR. Anti-cancerous drug telmisartan ( TEL) was loaded on monolayer APTES grafted MNPs. In-vitro controlled drug release and cytotoxicity study on PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line of TEL conjugated MNPs are also discussed. This functionalization strategy can be extended to other biomedical applications where higher magnetization is desired.
