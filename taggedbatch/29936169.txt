 During the period 2014-2016 , removal of nutrients , organics and suspended solids from a small rural stream impacted by agricultural drainage in a natural and semi-constructed wetlands was evaluated. In 2014 , the wetland was irregularly flooded during high flows in the stream , in 2015 , the stream bed was cleaned and as a result the water level dropped down by about 0.5 m , thus no flooding occurred. In 2016 , the stream was blocked and water was permanently diverted into a wetland dominated by Phalaris arundinacea , Carex nigra and Scirpus sylvaticus. The results clearly revealed a positive role of permanent flooding resulting in the highest removal of all monitored parameters , i.e. nitrogen ( 38 %) , phosphorus ( 40 %) , BOD
