 To evaluate if parabulbar triamcinolone reduces orbital swelling in patients with Graves ophthalmopathy. This is a prospective study of a series of patients with active and moderate Graves ophthalmopathy. Short tau inversion recovery magnetic resonance was used to evaluate the intensity of the extraocular rectus<pathogen> muscles and orbital fat , before and after the treatment with parabulbar triamcinolone. The signal intensity ratio of the sum of the OD rectus<pathogen> muscles was 3.67 before treatment ( 95 % CI , 3.26-4.09) and 2.83 after treatment ( 95 % CI , 2.63-3.03) ( p < 0.001) , and of the muscles of the left orbit , 3.94 before treatment ( 95 % CI , 3.50-4.38) and 2.85 after treatment ( 95 % CI , 2.56-3.14) ( p < 0.001). The signal intensity ratio of the fat decreased from 2.95 ( 95 % CI , 2.69-3.21) to 2.33 ( 95 % CI , 2.07-2.58) ( p < 0.001). After treatment , there were no local or systemic complications. The use of parabulbar triamcinolone reduces orbital inflammation<symptom> of patients with active and moderate Graves ophthalmopathy.
