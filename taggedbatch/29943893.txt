 Mobile phone applications ( apps) , may support pediatric oncology patients with medication and disease management. A scoping review of the literature , a search of the iTunes App and Google Play Stores , was conducted to identify medication and symptom management apps for adult and pediatric oncology patients. Pooled results yielded 28 apps which were assessed for quality using the Mobile Application Rating Scale , with mean overall scores ranging from 2.8 to 4.3. Most apps received low scores in the Engagement domain. Our study assessed the quality of available mobile oncology apps and identified areas for improvement in design and function.
