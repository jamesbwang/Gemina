 Immunoglobulin A nephropathy ( IgAN) , membranous nephropathy ( MN) and minimal-change disease ( MCD) are three common types of glomerulonephritis<disease> in China. Pathological diagnosis based on renal biopsy is the criterion and the golden standard for diagnosing the sub-types of primary or secondary glomerulonephritis<disease>. Immunoglobulin and complements might be used in the differential diagnosis of glomerulonephritis<disease> without renal biopsies. However , the relationship between IF intensities of immune proteins and the corresponding serum levels remained unclear , and seldom studies combine histopathological examination results and blood tests together for a predictive purpose. This study was considered as a pilot study for integrating histopathological indicators into serum parameters for exploring the relationship of IF intensity and serum values of immunoglobulin and complement , and for screening and investigating effective indicators inIgAN , MN and MCD. Renal tissue immunofluorescence ( IF) intensity grades and serum levels of immunoglobulin and complements ( IgG , IgA , IgM , C3 and C4) were retrospectively analyzed in 236 cases with IgAN , MN or MCD. IF grades were grouped as negative (-) , positive ( +) or strong positive ( + +) with both high and low magnification of microscope. Other serum indicators such as urea nitrogen ( BUN) , creatinine ( Crea) and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) were also evaluated among the groups. There were difference in IgA , IgG and C3 IF intensity grades among IgAN , MN and MCD groups ( p = 9.82E-43 , 4.60E-39 , 7.45E-15 , respectively). Serum values of BUN , Crea , eGFR , IgG , IgA , IgM and C4 showed difference in three groups ( BUN: p = 0.045 , Crea: p = 3.45E-5 , eGFR: p = 0.005 , IgG: p = 1.68E-14 , IgA: p = 9.14E-9 , IgM: p = 0.014 , C4: p = 0.026). eGFR had the trend to decrease with enhanced IgA IF positive grades ( p = 8.99E-4); Crea had trends to decrease with both enhanced IgA and IgG IF intensity grades ( p = 2.06E-6 , 2.94E-5 , respectively). In all subjects , serum IgA levels was inversely correlated with eGFR ( r =- 0.216 , p = 0.001) and correlated with Crea levels ( r = 0.189 , p = 0.004); serum IgG and Crea showed no correlation which were discordance with inverse correlation of IgG IF grade and Crea ( r = 0.058 , p = 0.379). IgG serum level was inverse correlated with its IF grades ( p = 3.54E-5 , p = 7.08E-6 , respectively); C3 serum levels had significantly difference between Neg and positive ( +) group ( p = 0.0003). IgA serum level was positive correlated with its IF grades ( Neg- ( +): p = 0.0001; ( +)- ( + +): p = 0.022; Neg- ( + +): p = 2.01E-10). After matching comparison among C3 groups , C3 Neg. group and C3 + + group had difference ( * p = 0.017). C4 had all negative IF expression in all pathological groups. In IgAN subjects , there were statistical differences of serum C3 levels between its pathological Neg and positive ( +) group ( p = 0.026) , and serum IgA levels showed difference between IgA pathological positive ( +) and ( + +) ( p = 0.007). In MN subjects , sIgG levels showed difference between IgG pathological IF grade positive ( +) and ( + +) ( p = 0.044); serum C3 levels showed difference between C3 pathological IF grade Neg and positive ( +) ( p = 0.005); and serum IgA levels showed difference between Neg and positive ( +) ( p = 0.040). In IgAN , eGFR showed serum IgA levels had significant differences among groups ( p = 0.007) and had increasing trend with enhanced its IF grades ( P Our research cross contrasts several immunoprotein IF intensities and relevant serum levels in three kinds of primary glomerular nephritis , and finally acquired helpful results for understanding the relationships between pathological presentation and serological presentation of immunoproteins in kidney diseases. Furthermore , this pilot study is offering a possible method for the analysis of combination of pathology and serology. Different pathological types of nephritis presented different expression patterns of immunoglobulin and complement , especially IgA and IgG , which suggested different pathogenesis involved in the development of IgAN and MN. Furthermore , either in tissue or in serum , increased IgA level was closely related with renal function in all of the patients.
