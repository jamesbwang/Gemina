 Empathy is one of the most important communication skills in clinical practice , specifically in the field of oncology. Empathic competences have a significant meaning for caring and therapeutic relations in nurses ' responsibilities. Clinical empathy brings positive performance , thus patients ' emotions are perceived and expressed more easily. Clinical empathy is contextual , interpersonal and affective , but it is also difficult to study. Awareness of oncology nurses ' perception of this phenomenon might help them to plan for more effective patient-centered consultations within interventional programs. Therefore , the aim of this study was to explore the content of clinical empathy with cancer patients from the perspective of oncology nurses. In this qualitative study , 15 oncology nurses were selected by purposive sampling. A semi-structured face-to-face interview was conducted with each of the participants. After data collection , all interviews were transcribed and reviewed , and then primary codes , sub-categories and categories were extracted. The data were analyzed with the conventional content analysis method by MAXQDA 10 software. Clinical empathy showed a composite construct with five main categories , including co-presence ( physical and emotional presence) , metacognition ( self-awareness of mental processes) , perception ( knowing about awareness of individuals) , inherent ( genetic) and didactic ( instructive) nature. Clinical empathy as an effective strategy can be taught through three areas of `` co-presence '' , `` metacognition '' and `` perception '' in the context of cancer care. Thus , clinical empathy should be considered as one of the competency standards which can be taught to oncology nurses.
