 Soil contamination with antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria/genes ( ARB/ARGs) has becoming an emerging environmental problem. Moreover , the mixed pollutants ' transfer and accumulation from soil to tuberous vegetables has posed a great threat against food security and human health. In this work , the application of two absorbing materials ( maize biochar and sulfate modified eggshell) was able to reduce the poisonous effect of soil antibiotics on potato root system by stimulate the dissipation of water-soluble antibiotics in soil; and also improve food quality by increasing potato starch , protein , fat , and vitamins. Meanwhile , both amendments could effectively decrease the classes and the accumulative abundance of ARB and ARGs ( sulI , sulII , catI , catII , ermA , ermB) in the edible parts of potato. The lowest abundance of ARGs was detected in the biochar application treatment , with the accumulative ARG level of 8.9 Ã— 10
