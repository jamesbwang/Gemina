 Genomic prediction is feasible for estimating genomic breeding values because of dense genome-wide markers and credible statistical methods , such as Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction ( GBLUP) and various Bayesian methods. Compared with GBLUP , Bayesian methods propose more flexible assumptions for the distributions of SNP effects. However , most Bayesian methods are performed based on Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC) algorithms , leading to computational efficiency challenges. Hence , some fast Bayesian approaches , such as fast BayesB ( fBayesB) , were proposed to speed up the calculation. This study proposed another fast Bayesian method termed fast BayesC ( fBayesC). The prior distribution of fBayesC assumes that a SNP with probability γ has a non-zero effect which comes from a normal density with a common variance. The simulated data from QTLMAS XII workshop and actual data on large yellow croaker were used to compare the predictive results of fBayesB , fBayesC and ( MCMC-based) BayesC. The results showed that when γ was set as a small value , such as 0.01 in the simulated data or 0.001 in the actual data , fBayesB and fBayesC yielded lower prediction accuracies ( abilities) than BayesC. In the actual data , fBayesC could yield very similar predictive abilities as BayesC when γ ≥ 0.01. When γ = 0.01 , fBayesB could also yield similar results as fBayesC and BayesC. However , fBayesB could not yield an explicit result when γ ≥ 0.1 , but a similar situation was not observed for fBayesC. Moreover , the computational speed of fBayesC was significantly faster than that of BayesC , making fBayesC a promising method for genomic prediction.
