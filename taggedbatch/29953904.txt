 It has been suggested that the orexin system modulates learning and memory-related processes. However , the possible influence that training could have on the effect of the blockade of orexin-A selective receptor ( OX1R) on a spatial memory task has not been explored. Therefore , the present study attempts to compare the effects of OX1R antagonist SB-334867 infusion on spatial memory in two different conditions in the Morris Water Maze ( MWM). This experiment evaluated the animals ' performance in weak training ( 2 trials per session) vs strong training ( 6 trials per session) protocols in a spatial version of the MWM. We found that in the 2-trial condition the post-training SB-334867 infusion had a negative effect on consolidation as well as on the retention and reversal learning of the task 72 h later. This effect was not apparent in the 6-trial condition. In addition , while the strong training groups showed a general increase in c-Fos expression in several brain areas of the hippocampal-thalamic-cortical circuit , SB-334867 administration had the opposite effect in areas that have been previously reported to have a high density of OX1R. Specifically , the SB-infused group in the 2-trial condition showed a decrease in c-Fos immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus , granular retrosplenial and prelimbic cortices , and centrolateral thalamic nucleus. This was not observed for subjects in the 6-trial condition. The activation of these areas could constitute a neuroanatomical substrate involved in the compensatory mechanisms of training upon SB-334867 impairing effects on a MWM spatial task.
