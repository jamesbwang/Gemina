 Diabetes is associated with significant psychological distress. It is , therefore , important to ensure the physical and emotional as well as psychosocial wellbeing of individuals living with diabetes. Meditation-based strategies have been evaluated for their complementary role in several chronic disorders including depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , obesity , hypertension , cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The practice of meditation is associated with reduction in stress and negative emotions and improvements in patient attitude , health-related behaviour and coping skills. There is increased parasympathetic activity with reduction in sympathetic vascular tone , stress hormones and inflammatory markers. Additionally , several studies evaluated the role of mindfulness-based stress reduction in diabetic individuals and demonstrated modest improvements in body<symptom> weight , glycaemic control and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. Thus , mindfulness meditation-based intervention can lead to improvements across all domains of holistic care- biological , psychological and social. Though most of these studies have been of short duration and included small numbers of patients , meditation strategies can be useful adjunctive techniques to lifestyle modification and pharmacological management of diabetes and help improve patient wellbeing.
