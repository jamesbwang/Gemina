 Miniature size in horses represents an extreme reduction of withers height that originated after domestication. In some breeds , it is a highly desired trait representing a breed- or subtype-specific feature. The genomic changes that emerged due to strong-targeted selection towards this distinct type remain unclear. Comparisons of whole-genome sequencing data from two Miniature Shetland ponies and one standard-sized Shetland pony , performed to elucidate genetic determinants for miniature size , revealed four synergistic variants , limiting withers height to 34.25 in. ( 87 cm). Runs of homozygosity regions were detected spanning these four variants in both the Miniature Shetland ponies and the standard-sized Shetland pony. They were shown to be characteristic of the Shetland pony breed , resulting in a miniature type under specific genotypic combinations. These four genetic variants explained 72 % of the size variation among Shetland ponies and related breeds. The length of the homozygous regions indicate that they arose over 1000 years ago. In addition , a copy number variant was identified in DIAPH3 harboring a loss exclusively in ponies and donkeys and thus representing a potential height-associated variant. This study reveals main drivers for miniature size in horses identified in whole genome data and thus provides relevant candidate genes for extremely short stature in mammals.
