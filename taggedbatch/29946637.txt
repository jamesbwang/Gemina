 To investigate the expression of Kruppel-like factor 5 ( KLF5) in human periodontal ligament cells ( hPDLCs) under cyclic tensile stress ( CTS) and its effect on proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hPDLCs. hPDLCs were primarily cultured in vitro by tissue explant and enzyme digestion method. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect mRNA and protein expression of KLF5 in hPDLCs stimulated by 10 % CTS at a frequency of 0.5 Hz for 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 and 24 h , respectively ． KLF5 was then knocked-down in hPDLCs using siRNA ( si-KLF5) and its mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR. Meanwhile , basic fibroblast growth factor ( FGF2) was overexpressed in KLF-5 silenced hPDLCs by using pcDNA3.1-FGF2. After stimulation with CTS for 8 h , the proliferation of hPDLCs was assayed by CCK-8 kit , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) activity was assayed by ALP kit , the mRNA expression of Runx2 and Osterix was examined by RT-PCR , and the protein expression of Runx2 , Osterix , FGF2 , GSK-3β , P-GSK-3β ( ser 9) , β-catenin was determined by Western blot. The data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 software package. Stimulation with 10 % CTS time-dependently induced mRNA and protein expression of KLF5 in hPDLCs. Transfection of si-KLF5 significantly reduced the proliferation of hPDLCs , decreased ALP activity and expression of Runx2 and Osterix in hPDLCs stimulated by 10 % CTS. Simultaneously , CTS-induced activation of FGF2-GSK-3β/ β-catenin signaling pathway was also inhibited by si-KLF5 transfection. However , overexpression of FGF2 can partly neutralized the inhibitiory effect of si-KLF5 on proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hPDLCs subjected to 10 % CTS. KLF5 promotes proliferation and osteogenesis differentiation of hPDLCs subjected to cyclic tensile stress through FGF2-GSK-3β/ β-catenin signaling pathway.
