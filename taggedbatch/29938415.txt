 Objective Structured Long Examination Record ( OSLER) scale was introduced in 1997 by Gleeson to improve the long case examination. There is no psychometric evidence to support reliability of OSLER. This study was done to analyse inter-rater reliability of OSLER. Two groups of examiners assessed 105 students in long case examination of their final professional examination , using OSLER scale. Group 1 was composed of actual examiners while Group 2 was mock examiners. Kappa statistic and intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC) were used on SPSS 23 to calculate reliability. Mean score awarded by actual examiners was 55.36 ( SD = 11.2) whereas mean score by mock examiners was 57.74 ( SD = 14.1). Cronbach 's alpha was 0.586 , Kappa was 0.019 whereas inter-rater reliability on ICC was 0.413. Although OSLER is a practical modification of long case examination with good validity , the scale needs to be more structured to improve its reliability.
