 Oil extraction from the kernels of Argania spinosa ( L.) Skeels ( Sapotaceae) , an endemic tree of Morocco , produces argan press-cake ( APC) used as a shampoo and to treat sprains , scabies , and for healing wounds<disease><symptom>. We have previously reported that argan oil has antimelanogenesis effect. Here , we determined if the by-product , APC , has melanogenesis regulatory effect using B16 murine melanoma cells. The effect of APC ethanol extract on cell proliferation and melanin content of B16 cells were measured , and to elucidate the mechanism involved , the expression level of melanogenic enzymes tyrosinase ( TYR) , dopachrome tautomerase ( DCT) , and tyrosinase-related protein 1 ( TRP1) were determined and mRNA expression level of microphthalmia- associated transcription factor ( Mitf) and Tyr genes were quantified. APC ethanol extract showed a significant melanin biosynthesis inhibitory effect on B16 cells in a time-dependent manner without cytotoxicity , which could be due to the decreased expression of TYR , TRP1 , and DCT in a time-dependent manner. APC extract down regulated Mitf and Tyr. Decreased TRP1 and DCT levels could be due to post-translational modifications. These results suggest that APC extract may be used as a new source of natural whitening products and may be introduced as an important pharmacological agent for the treatment of hyperpigmentation disorders.
