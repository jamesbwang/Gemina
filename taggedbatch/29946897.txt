 ITK-SNAP is an interactive software tool for manual and semi-automatic segmentation of 3D medical images. This paper summarizes major new features added to ITK-SNAP over the last decade. The main focus of the paper is on new features that support semi-automatic segmentation of multi-modality imaging datasets , such as MRI scans acquired using different contrast mechanisms ( e.g. , T1 , T2 , FLAIR). The new functionality uses decision forest<disease> classifiers trained interactively by the user to transform multiple input image volumes into a foreground/background probability map; this map is then input as the data term to the active contour evolution algorithm , which yields regularized surface representations of the segmented objects of interest. The new functionality is evaluated in the context of high-grade and low-grade glioma segmentation by three expert neuroradiogists and a non-expert on a reference dataset from the MICCAI 2013 Multi-Modal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge ( BRATS). The accuracy of semi-automatic segmentation is competitive with the top specialized brain tumor segmentation methods evaluated in the BRATS challenge , with most results obtained in ITK-SNAP being more accurate , relative to the BRATS reference manual segmentation , than the second-best performer in the BRATS challenge; and all results being more accurate than the fourth-best performer. Segmentation time is reduced over manual segmentation by 2.5 and 5 times , depending on the rater. Additional experiments in interactive placenta segmentation in 3D fetal ultrasound illustrate the generalizability of the new functionality to a different problem domain.
