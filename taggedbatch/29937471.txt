 Cedar<pathogen> pollinosis is one of the most prevalent forms of seasonal allergic reaction in Japan. Only one prospective study has examined the association between cedar<pathogen> pollinosis and mortality. Using a symptom-based questionnaire on cedar<pathogen> pollinosis , we investigated the association of cedar<pathogen> pollinosis with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Data came from the Takayama Study , which recruited residents aged â‰¥ 35 years in 1992 from Takayama city in Gifu Prefecture , Japan. The current study used information on cedar<pathogen> pollinosis that was obtained from the second survey in 2002. A total of 12,471 persons who were 45-80 years old and had no history of cancer , coronary heart disease , or stroke responded to a questionnaire asking about four symptoms related to cedar<pathogen> pollinosis. Mortality and migration data were obtained throughout the follow-up period up to March 2013. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the relation between cedar<pathogen> pollinosis and mortality. A total of 1,276 persons died during follow-up period. Among these , there were 504 neoplasm , 278 cardiovascular , and 181 respiratory deaths. After adjusting for potential confounders , cedar<pathogen> pollinosis was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality ( hazard ratio ( HR) 0.79; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.65-0.95) and respiratory mortality ( HR 0.38; 95 % CI , 0.18-0.82). There was no significant association between cedar<pathogen> pollinosis and mortality due to neoplasm or cardiovascular disease. We found an inverse association between cedar<pathogen> pollinosis and the risk of all-cause and respiratory mortality. Further research is needed to elucidate the association between cedar<pathogen> pollinosis and mortality.
