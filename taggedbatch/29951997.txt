 The presence of follicular cellular processes ( FCP) that cross the zona pellucida , has been recorded in the ovarian follicles of Callorhinchus callorhynchus. This constitutes the first report describing the presence of these structures in a species of the Holocephali. Considering that FCPs have only previously been reported in the Selachii , these findings suggest that FCPs could have been lost by the Batoidea after their divergence , around 280 M B.P..
