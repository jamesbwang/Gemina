 Low<symptom> back pain is a common cause of medical consultation during pregnancy and usually supposes a non-malignant prognostic. We report two cases of pregnant women whom suffered cauda equina<pathogen> syndrome<disease><symptom> during pregnancy and underwent emergency surgery after the birth of their babies. MRI is the main diagnosis method for cauda equina<pathogen> even during pregnancy. Modern obstetric practice asks surgeons to perform surgery under safe conditions at all gestation stages. Surgical decompression reports better prognosis when practiced within the first 48 h after the onset of saddle hypoesthesia. When CES is suspected , after MRI study , emergency surgery is the only solution to improve the condition of these patients.
