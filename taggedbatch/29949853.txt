 Cyanopeptolins ( CPs) are one of the most frequently occurring cyanobacterial peptides , many of which are inhibitors of serine proteases. Some CP variants are also acutely toxic to aquatic organisms , especially small crustaceans. In this study , thirteen CPs , including twelve new variants , were detected in the cyanobacterium
