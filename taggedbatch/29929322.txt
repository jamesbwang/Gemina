 Childhood allergies are dynamic and associated with environmental factors. The influence of prenatal maternal smoking and obesity on childhood allergies and their comorbidities remains unclear , especially in prospective cohorts with serial longitudinal observations. We examined time trends in the prevalence and comorbidity of childhood allergies , including wheeze , eczema<disease><symptom> , and rhinoconjunctivitis , using a large-scale , population-based birth cohort in Japan , and assessed the effects of prenatal maternal smoking and BMI on the risk of childhood allergies. Parents completed the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood ( ISAAC) questionnaires about symptoms of allergies and their risk factors at age 1 , 2 , 4 , and 7 years. Complete data from all pre- and postnatal questionnaires at age 1 , 2 , 4 , and 7 were available for 3296 mother-child pairs. We observed significant overlap of childhood allergies at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 7 years. Maternal serum cotinine during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of wheezing in the children at age 1 , 2 , and 4 but disappeared at age 7. In contrast , maternal cotinine levels were inversely associated with the prevalence of eczema<disease><symptom> in children at age 7. We additionally observed that maternal pre-pregnancy BMI , not children 's BMI , had a positive association with wheeze and an inverse association with eczema<disease><symptom> in 7-year-old children , respectively. We did not find any association of examined maternal factors and rhinoconjunctivitis. We demonstrated contrasting association of prenatal maternal smoking and high BMI with postnatal wheeze and eczema<disease><symptom>. For precise assessment of allergy-associated risk factors , we need to contrast risk factors for different allergic diseases since focusing solely on one allergic disease may result in misleading information on the role of different risk factors.
