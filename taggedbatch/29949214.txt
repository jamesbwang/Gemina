 A novel core-shell structured nanocatalyst ( Fe3O4@nSiO2-NH2-FeCu nanoparticles) with ultrafine FeCu alloy NPs magnetically immobilized in porous silica has been fabricated. The obtained catalyst revealed excellent activity and chemoselectivity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of nitroarenes to corresponding anilines using hydrazine hydrate as the hydrogen source , and the reaction could be carried out smoothly in water , which is an environmentally friendly solvent. The FeCu alloy effectively prevented the dehalogenation of halonitroarenes , and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) study showed that it was contributed from the electron-enrichment of Fe from Cu. A kinetics study indicated that the reaction order was ~ 1.5 towards 4-CNB and the apparent active energy ( Ea) was 48.1 kJ Â· mol-1 , which was a relatively low value. Furthermore , the FeCu NPs are magnetically immobilized in the silica spheres ( Fe3O4@SiO2) , therefore the catalyst can be easily recovered by an external magnetic and also possess long life time.
