 Species across the rodent genus Peromyscus have become prominent models for studying diverse mechanistic and evolutionary processes , including chromosome evolution , infectious<disease> disease<disease> transmission and human health , ecological adaptation , coat color variation , and parental care. Supporting such diverse research programs has been the development of genetic and genomic resources for species within this genus , including genome data , interspecific chromosome homologies , and a recently developed genetic map. Based on interspecific hybrids between the deer mouse ( Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii) and the old-field , or beach , mouse ( Peromyscus polionotus) and backcross progeny to Peromyscus maniculatus , a linkage map was developed based on 190 genes and 141 microsatellite loci. However , resolution of several linkage groups with respect to chromosome assignment was lacking and four chromosomes ( 8 , 16 , 20 , and 21) were not clearly delineated with linkage data alone. The recent development of a high-density map for Peromyscus proved ineffective in resolving chromosome linkage for these four chromosomes. Herein we present an updated linkage map for Peromyscus maniculatus , including linkage group-chromosome assignments , using fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping of BACs and whole chromosome paints. We resolve the previously conflicting chromosome assignment of linkage groups to Chromosomes 8 , 16 , 20 , and 21 , and confirm the assignment of linkage groups to Chromosomes 18 and 22. This updated linkage map with validated chromosome assignment provides a solid foundation for chromosome nomenclature for this species.
