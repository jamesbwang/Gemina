 Idiopathic chronic diarrhea<disease><symptom> ( ICD) is a common ailment affecting captive rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta). ICD cases are characterized by diarrhea<disease><symptom> in the absence of commonly identified diarrheal pathogens and multiple recurrences even after supportive therapy. Histologically , the disease is characterized by lymphoplasmacytic colitis<disease>. We identified 35 rhesus macaques euthanized for ICD during a 7-month period and described demographic , clinical , histologic , and immunologic commonalities. We found a trend of historic Campylobacter<pathogen> spp. and trichomonad infections. Furthermore , rhesus macaques with ICD demonstrated loss of normal colonic adherent bacterium<pathogen> , identified in this study as Helicobacter<pathogen> macacae<pathogen>; increased abundance of Pentatrichomonas hominis<pathogen>; and increased frequency of colonic serotonin-positive enterochromaffin cells. Interestingly , colonic and ileal T-helper cells of animals with ICD manifested decreased capacity for expression of certain cytokines , in particular interleukin ( IL) -4 and IL-13. These data further describe a common ailment and suggest new avenues to identify complex interactions involved in the etiology of recurring diarrhea<disease><symptom> in young rhesus macaques.
