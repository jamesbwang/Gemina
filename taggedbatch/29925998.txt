 Neurodegenerative diseases in which tau accumulation plays a cardinal role in the pathogenic process are called tauopathies , and when tau isoforms having four repeats of the microtubule binding sites , four-repeat tau , are selectively accumulated as pathological hallmarks , the term four-repeat tauopathy is used. The major four-repeat tauopathies are progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP) , corticobasal degeneration ( CBD) , and argyrophilic grain disease ( AGD). Historically , neuronal cytopathologies , e.g. , neurofibrillary tangles and ballooned neurons , were emphasized as characteristic lesions<symptom> in PSP and CBD. Now , however , astrocytic tau pathologies , i.e. , tufted astrocytes ( TAs) and astrocytic plaques ( APs) , are considered to be highly disease-specific lesions<symptom>. Although granular/fuzzy astrocytes ( GFAs) frequently develop in the limbic system in AGD cases , the specificity is not conclusive yet. Some AGD cases have a few TAs , and to a lesser frequency , a few APs in the frontal cortex and subcortical nuclei. The number of astrocytic tau pathologies including TAs and GFAs increases with the progression of AGD. In this paper , histopathological features of astrocytic tau pathologies in PSP , CBD , and AGD are first reviewed. Then , recent findings regarding the coexistence of these tauopathies are summarized from a viewpoint of astrocytic tau pathologies. Further biochemical and pathological studies focusing tau-positive astrocytic lesions<symptom> may be useful to increase understanding of the pathological process in four-repeat tauopathies and to develop novel therapeutic strategies for patients with these diseases.
