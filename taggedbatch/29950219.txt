 To analyze the clinicopathological features and prognostic factors of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL). Ninety-four cases of DLBCL followed up were selected in Fujian Tumor Hospital. The immunohistochemistry method was used to detect the protein expressions of BCL-2 BCL-6 , MYC , CD10 and MUM-1 , the gene abnormalities of MYC and BCL-2 were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization , and the clinical pathological features and the related factors affecting prognosis in the patients with DLBCL were analyzed. The protein positive rates of BCL-2 , BCL-6 , MYC , CD10 and MUM-1 in 94 patients were 75.53 % ( 71/94) , 58.51 % ( 55/94) , 52.13 % ( 49/94) , 15.96 % ( 15/94) and 34.04 % ( 32/94) respectively. The detection rate of MYC gene abnormality was 20.93 % ( 9/43) and the detection rate of BCL-2 gene abnormality was 44 % ( 22/50); 2 kinds of gene abnormalities were of multiple copies , and 2 cases ( 2.13 %) were abnormal in MYC and BCL-2 genes simultaneously. The median survival time of 3 years in 94 patients was 21.79 months ( 2-36 months) , and the overall survival rates of 1 and 3 years were 82.98 % and 64.89 % respectively. Single factor analysis revealed that the high ECOG score ( â‰¥ 2) , high international prognostic index ( IPI) classification , positive expression of BCL-6 protein , and MYC and BCL-2 gene simultaneously abnormal were the risk factors influencing the prognosis ( all P < 0.05). COX regression analysis showed that IPI classification , ECOG score and treatment methods were independent factors influencing the prognosis ( all P < 0.05). IPI classification , ECOG score and treatment methods have greater impacts on the prognosis of patients with DLBCL. Chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy or surgical treatment can significantly improve the prognosis of patients.
