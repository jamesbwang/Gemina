 The large number of non-coding RNAs ( ncRNAs) and their breadth of functionalities has fuelled many studies on their roles in cancer. We previously linked four microRNAs to breast cancer prognosis. One of these microRNAs , hsa-miR-7 , was found to be regulated by another type of ncRNA , the circular non-coding RNA ( circRNA) CDR1-AS , which contains multiple hsa-miR-7 binding sites. Based on this finding , we studied the potential clinical value of this circRNA on breast cancer prognosis in a cohort based on a cohort that was previously analysed for hsa-miR-7 and in an adjuvant hormone-na√Øve cohort for 1
