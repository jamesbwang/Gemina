 Scabies is a contagious skin infestation that mainly presents with itching at night and skin burrows that are visible to the naked eye. Diagnosing scabies with dermoscopy is still a matter of controversy. The aim of our study was to compare the diagnostic properties of adhesive tape , skin scraping , and dermoscopy in diagnosing scabies. One hundred patients with clinical presumptive diagnoses of scabies underwent skin scraping , adhesive tape testing , and dermoscopic examination. Each diagnostic procedure was performed on three different areas. Comparing the diagnostic properties of the three methods , the adhesive tape test was the most sensitive method for diagnosing scabies. Sixteen cases ( 16.0 %) were definitely diagnosed as scabies using the adhesive tape test detecting the presence of mites or their eggs. Only 10 cases ( 10.0 %) were definitely diagnosed as scabies using the skin scraping test detecting mites or their eggs. Dermoscopic examination suggested a diagnosis of scabies in 22 cases ( 22.0 %) , of which only 10 were definitely diagnosed as scabies by detecting mites using the adhesive tape test , skin scraping , or both. The diagnosis of scabies can only be confirmed by seeing mites. The adhesive tape test and skin scraping procedure have high specificity in diagnosing scabies , but their low sensitivity can not exclude the possibility of scabies. Dermoscopy-guided tape testing can be a helpful tool for better diagnosis of scabies.
