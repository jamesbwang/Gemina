 Currently , hospital nursing care workers ( hereafter referred to as HNCWs) have become an important part of the healthcare system in China. They exist in nearly all of the public hospitals and in some private hospitals , making up 20 to 30 % of the total nursing staff and providing 30 to 40 % of basic nursing care for patients. However , many studies have shown that the turnover rate of HNCWs is very high , with average annual rates of 20 to 45 %. We conducted this survey to explore their turnover intentions and related factors and present some suggestions to improve their retention rate. A total of 514 HNCWs employed at 11 hospitals in Shanghai participated in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: ( 1) being a certified HNCW , ( 2) having worked as an HNCW for more than 1 year , and ( 3) volunteering to take part in the survey. The overall turnover intention of the HNCWs was 41.3 %. Influencing factors include education ( βeta = 0.201 , P = 0.000) , wages ( βeta =- 0.920 , P = 0.000) , management satisfaction , ( βeta =- 0.213 , P = 0.000) , satisfaction with wages ( βeta =- 0.612 , P = 0.000) , satisfaction with working hours ( βeta =- 0.270 , P = 0.000) , satisfaction with their own work ( βeta =- 0.066 , P = 0.027) , work stress ( βeta = 0.726 , P = 0.000) , enjoyment of the job ( βeta =- 0.141 , P = 0.000) and hours of sleep ( βeta =- 0.046 , P = 0.037). Decreasing HNCWs ' turnover intentions and the overall turnover rate is important for improving the quality of healthcare. More attention should be paid to this issue in the enactment of health policy.
