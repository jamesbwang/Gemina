 Diaminobutyric polypropylenimine ( DAB) dendrimers have been shown to be highly efficient non-viral gene delivery systems for cancer therapy. However , their cytotoxicity currently limits their applications. To overcome this issue , PEGylation of DAB dendrimer , using various PEG molecular weights and dendrimer generations , has been attempted to decrease the cytotoxicity and enhance the DNA condensation , size and zeta potential , cellular uptake and transfection efficacy of these dendriplexes. Among all the PEGylated dendrimers synthesized , generation 3- and generation 4-DAB conjugated to low molecular weight PEG ( 2 kDa) at a dendrimer: DNA ratio of 20:1 and 10:1 resulted in an increase in gene expression on almost all tested cancer cells lines ( by up to 3.2-fold compared to unmodified dendrimer in A431 cells). The highest level of β-galactosidase gene expression ( 10.07 × 10
