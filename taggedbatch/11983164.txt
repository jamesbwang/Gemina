 Bacteria are not simply passive consumers of nutrients or merely steady-state systems. Rather , bacteria are active participants in their environments , collecting information from their surroundings and processing and using that information to adapt their behavior and optimize survival. The bacterial regulome is the set of physical interactions that link environmental information to the expression of genes by way of networks of sensors , transporters , signal cascades , and transcription factors. As bacteria can not have one dedicated sensor and regulatory response system for every possible condition that they may encounter , the sensor systems must respond to a variety of overlapping stimuli and collate multiple forms of information to make `` decisions '' about the most appropriate response to a specific set of environmental conditions. Here , we analyze Pseudomonas<pathogen> fluorescens<pathogen> transcriptional responses to multiple sulfur nutrient sources to generate a predictive , computational model of the sulfur regulome. To model the regulome , we utilize a transmitter-channel-receiver scheme of information transfer and utilize principles from information theory to portray P.<pathogen> fluorescens<pathogen> as an informatics system. This approach enables us to exploit the well-established metrics associated with information theory to model the sulfur regulome. Our computational modeling analysis results in the accurate prediction of gene expression patterns in response to the specific sulfur nutrient environments and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of
