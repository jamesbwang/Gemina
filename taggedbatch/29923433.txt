 Patients with advanced well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours ( Wd-NETs) are commonly treated with somatostatin analogues ( SSAs). Some patients may develop SSA-related side effects such as pancreatic exocrine insufficiency ( PEI). In this prospective , observational study , the frequency of SSA-induced PEI in 50 sequential patients with advanced Wd-NETs treated with SSAs was investigated. Toxicity was assessed monthly and faecal elastase-1 ( FE1) and quality of life ( QoL) were assessed 3-monthly. The median age was 65.8 years , 58 % were male and the majority ( 92 %) of patients had metastatic disease; patients received 4-weekly long acting octreotide ( 60 %) or lanreotide ( 40 %). Twelve patients ( 24 %) developed SSA-related PEI after a median of 2.9 months from SSA initiation; FE1 was a reliable screening tool for PEI , especially in symptomatic ( abdominal bloating , flatulence<symptom> and/or diarrhea<disease><symptom>) patients ( risk ratio 8.25 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.15-59.01)). Most of these patients ( 11/12; 92 %) required PERT. Other SSA-related adverse events ( any grade) included flatulence<symptom> ( 50 %) , abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> ( 32 %) , diarrhoea<disease> ( 30 %) and fatigue<symptom> ( 20 %). Development of PEI did not significantly worsen overall QoL , however gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhoea<disease> were increased. This study demonstrated that PEI occurs at a higher rate than previously reported; clinicians need to diagnose and treat this SSA-related adverse-event which occurs in 1 in 4 patients with Wd-NETs treated with SSAs. Screening with FE1 in symtomatic patients is recommend.
