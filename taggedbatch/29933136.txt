 Prominent psychiatric diagnostic systems such as the DSM-IV and ICD-10 have shown low reliability in clinical practice. An alternative approach to classification of psychiatric disorders is prototype matching. In the current study , we examined reliability of assessing mood , anxiety<symptom> and personality disorders using a multi-method multi informant approach. More specifically , we examined diagnosis made by treating clinician and independent expert clinical interviewer , using three different diagnostic systems ( DSM symptom count , DSM-IV prototype diagnosis and empirically derived prototype diagnosis). A convenience sample of clinicians ( N = 80) and patients ( N = 170) from eight community mental health clinics in Israel participated in the study. Our findings show fair to excellent interrater reliability for prototype dimensional diagnostic systems ( ranged from 0.40 to 0.79) for most mood and anxiety<symptom> disorders examined. Overall , dimensional diagnostic systems , yielded better interrater reliability for mood , anxiety<symptom> and personality disorders , as compared with categorical diagnosis. There were no significant differences between dimensional systems. Our findings provide further support to the advantages of dimensional over categorical models in increasing reliability.
