 Integrative analysis using omics-based technologies results in the identification of a large number of putative short open reading frames ( sORFs) with protein-coding capacity within transcripts previously identified as long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) or transcripts of unknown function ( TUFs). sORFs were previously overlooked because of their diminutive size and the difficulty of identification by bioinformatics analyses. There is now growing evidence of the existence of potentially functional micropeptides produced from sORFs within cells of diverse species. Recent characterization of a few of these revealed their significant divergent roles in many fundamental biological processes , where some also show important relationships with pathogenesis. Recent works therefore provide new insights for exploring the wealth of information that may lie within sORF-encoded short proteins. Here , we summarize the current progress and view of micropeptides encoded in sORFs of protein-coding genes.
