 The study purpose was to determine the minimum number of monitoring days necessary to reliably capture walking among individuals with lower limb salvage. Nineteen participants with lower limb salvage wore an ankle-mounted motion sensor over a 7-day period to obtain step counts. Generalizability theory was used to examine the variance components in step counts ( G study) and to determine the appropriate length of activity monitoring using various combinations of days ( D study). Mean step counts were higher on weekends than on weekdays. Fifty percent of the total variance in step counts was accounted for by interindividual variability in walking ( D study). Eighty percent was reached individually with 4 weekdays , 2 weekend days , or 3 week days + weekend days. The study provides data for an appropriate monitoring method to track walking outcomes of rehabilitation for individuals with lower limb salvage.
