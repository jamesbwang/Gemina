 The oriental fruit moth , Grapholita molesta , is an important pest in many commercial orchards including apple , pear and peach orchards , and responsible for substantial economic losses every year. To help in attaining a comprehensive and thorough understanding of the ecological tolerances of G. molesta , we collected life history data of individuals reared on apples under different constant temperature regimes and compared the data with moths reared under a variable outdoor temperature environment. Because G. molesta individuals reared at a constant 25 °C had the heaviest pupal weight , the highest survival rate from egg to adult , highest finite rate of increase , and greatest fecundity , 25 °C was considered as the optimum developmental temperature. The G. molesta population reared at a constant 31 °C had the shortest development time , lowest survival rate and fecundity , resulting in population parameters of r < 0 , λ < 1 , lead to negative population growth. The population parameters r and λ reared under fluctuating temperature were higher than that reared under constant temperatures , the mean generation time ( T) was shorter than it was in all of the constant temperatures treatments. This would imply that the outdoor G. molesta population would have a higher population growth potential and faster growth rate than indoor populations raised at constant temperatures. G. molesta moths reared under fluctuating temperature also had a higher fertility than moths reared under constant temperatures ( except at 25 °C). Our findings indicated that the population raised under outdoor fluctuating temperature conditions had strong environment adaptiveness.
