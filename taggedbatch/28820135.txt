 During August 2017 , two separate clusters of platelet transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis<disease> were reported in Utah and California. In Utah , two patients died after platelet transfusions from the same donation. Clostridium<pathogen> perfringens<pathogen><disease> isolates from one patient 's blood , the other patient 's platelet bag , and donor skin swabs were highly related by whole genome sequencing ( WGS). In California , one patient died after platelet transfusion; Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> isolates from the patient 's blood and platelet bag residuals and a nontransfused platelet unit were matched using WGS. Investigation revealed no deviations in blood supplier or hospital procedures. Findings in this report highlight that even when following current procedures , the risk for transfusion-related infection and fatality persists , making additional interventions necessary. Clinicians need to be vigilant in monitoring for platelet-transmitted bacterial infections and report adverse reactions to blood suppliers and hemovigilance systems. Blood suppliers and hospitals could consider additional evidence-based bacterial contamination risk mitigation strategies , including pathogen inactivation , rapid detection devices , and modified screening of bacterial culture protocols.
