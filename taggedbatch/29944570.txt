 An 51-year-old female presented with a headache<symptom> , nausea<symptom> , vomiting , and weakness<symptom>. The lesion<symptom> resembling a hemorrhagic mass was observed in the brain tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the patient. However , thrombosis was suspected in the cerebral venules adjacent to the lesion<symptom>. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance perfusion data excluded neoplastic lesions<symptom>. Thus , the patient was treated for venous infarction. Hemorrhagic venous infarcts may mimic hemorrhagic masses. For this reason , the distinction of the lesions<symptom> is important for the treatment procedure. Advanced neuroimaging in lesions<symptom> resembling hemorrhagic masses must be performed for accurate diagnosis.
