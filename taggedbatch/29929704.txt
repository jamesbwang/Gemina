 Nationally-representative data suggest an association between lack of insurance and in-hospital death from sepsis<disease> ( Kumar et al. , 2014). It remains to be determined whether this association is attributable to differences in baseline health , care-seeking behaviors , hospital care , or other factors. To determine whether organ dysfunction present on admission for community-onset sepsis<disease> mediates the association between lack of insurance and mortality in sepsis<disease>. Retrospective cohort study using public discharge data from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. Inpatients age 18-64 with community-onset sepsis<disease> at California hospitals in 2010 were identified by diagnosis codes. Controlling for demographics , comorbidities , infection source , and hospital characteristics , lack of insurance was associated with an adjusted odds ratio ( OR) of 1.26 ( absolute risk difference 4.75 % , p < 0.001) for organ dysfunction present on admission for community-onset sepsis<disease>. Lack of insurance predicted in-hospital mortality ( adjusted OR 1.15 , p < 0.001). Organ dysfunction present on admission was the only significant mediator , explaining 22.3 % ( p < 0.001) of the effect of lack of insurance. The association between lack of insurance and organ dysfunction on admission in community-onset sepsis<disease> suggests that lack of insurance may impede timely care for patients with community-onset infections.
