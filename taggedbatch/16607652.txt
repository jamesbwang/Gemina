 Sickle-cell disease ( SCD) , which involves morphological changes to the red blood cells , is the most common hemoglobinopathy worldwide. This conformational change in erythrocytes affects multiple<symptom> organs and systems , including the hard and soft<disease> tissues of the stomatognathic system. The objective of this study was to provide a description of the maxillomandibular positioning of patients using computed tomography in a case series of 40 patients with SCD. To define the facial profile of patients , 2-dimensional ( 2D) and 3-dimensional ( 3D) McNamara and Steiner cephalometric tracings were performed. The results showed that there is a tendency to maxillary protrusion in 2D and 3D analyses. There was no statistical difference between the 2D and 3D evaluations; additionally , sex affected the maxillomandibular positioning of patients , but only in McNamara evaluations.
