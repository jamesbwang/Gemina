 The hypoxic ventilatory response ( HVR) is markedly attenuated by AMPK-Î±1 deletion conditional on the expression of Cre-recombinase in tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH) expressing cells , precipitating marked increases in apnea frequency and duration. It was concluded that ventilatory dysfunction caused by AMPK deficiency was driven by neurogenic mechanisms. However , TH is transiently expressed in other cell types during development , and it is evident that central respiratory<symptom> depression<symptom> can also be triggered by myogenic mechanisms that impact blood supply to the brain. We therefore assessed the effect on the HVR and systemic arterial blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> of AMPK deletion in vascular smooth muscles. There was no difference in minute ventilation during normoxia. However , increases in minute ventilation during severe hypoxia ( 8 % O
