 Methamphetamine abuse co-occurring with HIV<pathogen> infection presents neuropathology in brain regions that mediate reward and motivation. A neuronal signaling cascade altered acutely by meth and some HIV-1 proteins is the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) pathway. It remains unknown if chronic co-exposure to meth and HIV-1 proteins converge on MAPK in vivo. To make this determination , we studied young adult Fischer 344 HIV-1 transgenic ( Tg) and non-Tg rats that self-administered meth ( 0.02-0.04 mg/kg/0 .05 ml iv infusion , 2 h/day for 21 days) and their saline-yoked controls. One day following the operant task , rats were killed. Brain regions involved in reward-motivation ( i.e. , nucleus accumbens ( NA) and ventral pallidum<pathogen> ( VP)) , were assayed for a MAPK cascade protein , extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK) , and a downstream transcription factor , ΔFosB. In the NA , activated ( phosphorylated; p) ERK-to-ERK ratio ( pERK/ERK) was increased in meth-exposed Tg rats versus saline Tg controls , and versus meth non-Tg rats. ΔFosB was increased in meth Tg rats versus saline and meth non-Tg rats. Assessment of two targets of ΔFosB-regulated transcription revealed ( 1) increased dopamine D1 receptor ( D1R) immunoreactivity in the NA shell of Tg-meth rats versus saline Tg controls , but ( 2) no changes in the AMPA receptor subunit , GluA2. No changes related to genotype or meth occurred for ERK , ΔFosB or D1R protein in the VP. Results reveal a region-specific activation of ERK , and increases in ΔFosB and D1R expression induced by HIV-1 proteins and meth. Such effects may contribute to the neuronal and behavioral pathology associated with meth/HIV comorbidity.
