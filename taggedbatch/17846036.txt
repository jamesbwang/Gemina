 Arthropod-borne viruses are among the most genetically constrained RNA viruses , yet they have a remarkable propensity to adapt and emerge. We studied wild birds and mosquitoes naturally infected with West<pathogen><disease> Nile<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( WNV) in a ` hot spot ' of virus transmission in Chicago , IL , USA. We generated full coding WNV genome sequences from spatiotemporally matched bird and mosquito samples using high-throughput sequencing , allowing a molecular evolutionary assessment with deep coverage.
