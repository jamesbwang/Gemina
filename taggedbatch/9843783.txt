 Every year , enteric<disease> infections<disease> and associated diarrhea<disease><symptom> kill millions of people. The situation is compounded by increases in the number of enteric pathogens that are acquiring resistance to antibiotics , as well as ( hitherto) a relative paucity of information on host molecular targets that may contribute to diarrhea<disease><symptom>. Many forms of diarrheal disease depend on the dysregulation of intestinal ion transporters , and an associated imbalance between secretory and absorptive functions of the intestinal epithelium. A number of major transporters have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diarrheal diseases and thus an understanding of their expression , localization , and regulation after infection with various bacteria , viruses , and protozoa likely will prove critical in designing new therapies. This article surveys our understanding of transporters that are modulated by specific pathogens and the mechanism ( s) involved , thereby illuminating targets that might be exploited for new therapeutic approaches.
