 Hyaluronic acid dermal fillers are becoming popular all over the world , but due to the presence of many blood vessels in the face , there is always a small possibility of vascular complications. We present a case with the ischemic involvement of chin and neck<symptom> skin after accidental submental artery involvement after hyaluronic acid filler injection for chin region. Impending skin<symptom> necrosis<symptom> on the chin and upper neck on the right side was diagnosed quickly by observing the skin<symptom> changes<symptom> in the immediate postfiller phase. Pain in the mandible and in the muscles during swallowing due to possible ischemia of muscles supplied by submental artery was another crucial diagnostic feature. All parts of the affected zone were treated with high-dose pulsed hyaluronidase protocol using 4 pulses of hyaluronidase injection in first 24 hours after filler injection. Complete resolution of cutaneous ischemic changes and painful swallowing was achieved within days after treatment. Knowledge of presenting features of postfiller vascular complications and the extent of vascular territory of the involved artery is quite helpful in quickly instituting treatment leading to the near-complete recovery with minimal sequelae.
