 Affibody molecules are engineered scaffold proteins , which demonstrated excellent binding to selected tumor-associated molecular abnormalities in vivo and highly sensitive and specific radionuclide imaging of Her2-expressing tumors in clinics. Recently , we have shown that peptide nucleic acid ( PNA)- mediated affibody-based pretargeted radionuclide therapy using beta-emitting radionuclide
