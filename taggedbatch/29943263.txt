 Recent years have seen a large number of incidents involving the contamination of liquor with phthalate plasticizers ( PAEs). There is therefore an urgent need to develop novel analytical strategies for the rapid and sensitive detection of PAEs. The PAE butyl benzyl phthalate ( BBP) is very harmful to the human body , so we developed a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy ( SERS) platform for the rapid detection of BBP in liquor based on liquid-liquid extraction and the simultaneous self-assembly of arrays of Au nanoparticles ( Au NPs) at an organic/aqueous interface. The self-assembly of Au NPs occurs under the influence of the surface tension at the interface between the immiscible solvents. In the first step of the strategy , cyclohexane ( CYH) is mixed with BBP-containing liquor to extract the BBP. Then the self-assembly of Au NPs at an organic/aqueous interface is induced using the CYH supernatant as the organic phase , a colloid of Au NPs as the aqueous phase , and ethanol as the inducer. During this process , the BBP molecules extracted from the liquor participate directly in the Au NP self-assembly process , which causes the analytes to be loaded into SERS-active nanogaps in the Au NP arrays , thus permitting the sensitive detection of BBP. BBP levels as low as 1.3 mg/kg in the liquor were detected using this method. Fifteen batches of the assembled SERS platform produced a relative standard deviation of 10.58 % in the SERS intensity of the peak at 1178 cm
