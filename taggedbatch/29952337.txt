 The majority of the population of Bangladesh ( 90 %) rely on untreated groundwater for drinking and domestic use. At the point of collection , 40 % of these supplies are contaminated with faecal indicator bacteria ( FIB). Recent studies have disproved the theory that latrines discharging to shallow aquifers are the major contributor to this contamination. In this study , we tested the hypothesis that hand pumps are a reservoir of FIB. We sampled the handle , spout , piston and seal<disease> from 19 wells in Araihazar Upazila , Bangladesh and identified that the spout and seal were reservoirs of FIB. These findings led to our recommendation that well spouts be regularly cleaned , including the removal of precipitated deposits , and that the seals be regularly changed. It is envisaged that one or both of these interventions will reduce the numbers of FIB in drinking water , thereby reducing the burden of diarrhoeal disease in Bangladesh.
