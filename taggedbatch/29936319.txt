 Antimicrobial resistance ( AMR) in populations experiencing war has yet to be addressed despite the abundance of contemporary conflicts and the protracted nature of twenty-first century wars , in combination with growing global concern over conflict-associated bacterial pathogens. We use the example of the Syrian conflict to explore the feasibility of using existing global policies on AMR in conditions of extreme conflict. Available literature on AMR and prescribing behaviour in Syria before and since the onset of the conflict in March 2011 was identified. Overall , there is a paucity of rigorous data before and since the onset of conflict in Syria to contextualise the burden of AMR. However , post- onset of the conflict an increasing number of studies conducted in neighboring countries and Europe report AMR in Syrian refugees. High rates of multi-drug resistance , particularly Gram-negative organisms , are noted amongst Syrian refugees when compared with local populations. Conflict impedes many of the safeguards against AMR , creates new drivers , and exacerbates existing ones. Given the apparently high rates of AMR in Syria , in neighboring countries hosting refugees and in European countries providing asylum; this requires WHO and other global health institutions to address the causes , costs , and future considerations of conflict-related AMR as an issue of global governance.
