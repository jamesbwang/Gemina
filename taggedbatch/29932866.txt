 DNA methylation is a crucial epigenetic mechanism in obesity and fat distribution. We explored the Sarcospan ( SSPN) gene locus by using genome-wide data sets comprising methylation and expression data , pyrosequencing analysis in the promoter region , and genetic analysis of an SNP variant rs718314 , which was previously reported to associate with waist-to-hip ratio. We found that DNA methylation influences several clinical variables related to fat distribution and glucose metabolism , while SSPN mRNA levels showed directionally opposite effects on these traits. Complete DNA methylation of the SSPN promoter construct suppressed the gene expression of firefly luciferase in MCF7 cells. Moreover , rs718314 was associated with waist and with DNA methylation at CpG sites. Our data strongly support the role of the SSPN locus in body fat composition and glucose homeostasis , and suggest that this is most likely the result of changes in DNA methylation of SSPN in adipose tissue.-Keller , M. , Klös , M. , Rohde , K. , Krüger , J. , Kurze , T. , Dietrich , A. , Schön , M.
