 Mitochondria are sensitive to air pollutants due to their lack of repair capacity. Changes in mitochondrial DNA copy number ( mtDNAcn) or content is a proxy of mitochondrial damage and has been associated with recent exposure to traffic-derived air pollutants , nitrogen dioxide ( NO The present study investigated the relation between the internal marker AM BC and ambient NO A panel of 20 healthy retired participants ( 10 couples) living in Belgium underwent repeated assessments of health and air pollution exposure at 11 time points over one year. We increased exposure contrast temporarily by moving participants for 10 days to Milan , Italy ( high exposure) and to Vindeln , Sweden ( low exposure). Personal exposure to NO Mean concentrations of 5-day average NO In this quasi-experimental setting involving moving persons to places with high and low ambient air pollution , we found changes in AM BC according to ambient air pollution levels measured during the previous 5 days. Both higher ambient NO
