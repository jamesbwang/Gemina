 Evaluate potential for data mining auditing techniques to identify hidden concepts in diagnostic knowledge bases ( KB). Improving completeness enhances KB applications such as differential diagnosis and patient case simulation. Authors used unsupervised ( Pearson 's correlation- PC , Kendall 's correlation- KC , and a heuristic algorithm- HA) methods to identify existing and discover new finding-finding interrelationships ( `` properties '') in the INTERNIST-1/ QMR KB. Authors estimated KB maintenance efficiency gains ( effort reduction) of the approaches. The methods discovered new properties at 95 % CI rates of ( 0.1 % , 5.4 %) ( PC) , ( 2.8 %. 12.5 %) ( KC) , and ( 5.6 % , 18.8 %) ( HA). Estimated manual effort reduction for HA-assisted determination of new properties was approximately 50-fold. Data mining can provide an efficient supplement to ensuring the completeness of finding-finding interdependencies in diagnostic knowledge bases. Authors ' findings should be applicable to other diagnostic systems that record finding frequencies within diseases ( e.g. , DXplain , ISABEL).
