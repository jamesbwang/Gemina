 Baylisascaris procyonis is a zoonotic nematode mainly harbored by the North American raccoon. It can cause severe<symptom> neurological problems in paratenic hosts and humans. In Germany , raccoons are spread throughout the country. However , the presence of B. procyonis in the German raccoon population has not been thoroughly studied. For this study , 32 wild raccoons were collected in the urban area Leipzig , Saxony , Eastern Germany. Adult ascaroid nematodes were isolated from the intestines and morphologically identified as B. procyonis. Species confirmation was conducted through PCR. In total , adult B. procyonis worms were found in 24 raccoons. The results of the present study add new information about the presence of the parasite in Saxony , Germany. Similarly , the results highlight the importance of the raccoon as a reservoir of zoonotic parasites.
