 To investigate whether epinephrine in irrigation fluid improves visual clarity in arthroscopic shoulder surgery. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) that compared the surgical outcomes of patients who did and did not receive epinephrine during arthroscopic shoulder surgery. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , MEDLINE , and Embase for relevant RCTs. We used the Cochrane Collaboration 's tool to assess the risk of bias and adopted random-effects model meta-analysis to combine data. We used the Grades of Recommendation , Assessment , Development , and Evaluation ( GRADE) methodology to evaluate the overall quality of the body of the retrieved evidence. The primary outcome was visual clarity. The secondary outcomes were operative time , amount of irrigation fluid , the need for increased pump pressure , and adverse cardiovascular events. This study included three RCTs with a total of 238 participants ( 124 in the epinephrine group and 114 in the non-epinephrine group). The use of epinephrine in irrigation fluid for shoulder arthroscopy achieved better visual clarity ( standardized mean difference , 1.01; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.63 to 1.39; p < 0.0001) and less need for increased pump pressure ( risk ratio , 0.40; 95 % CI 0.25 to 0.64; p = 0.0001) compared to the non-epinephrine group. No significant differences were noted in operative time ( mean difference- 5.08; 95 % CI- 14.46 to 4.31; p = 0.29) and amount of irrigation fluid ( mean difference- 1.04; 95 % CI- 2.38 to 0.39; p = 0.12) between the two groups. No adverse events were recorded in any of the included trials. The current evidence shows that the use of epinephrine in arthroscopic shoulder surgery may improve visualization and does not appear to have any major disadvantages. Level I.
