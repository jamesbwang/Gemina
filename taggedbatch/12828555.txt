 Lenalidomide is an analog of thalidomide , with potent anticancer activity demonstrated in several hematological malignancies. It has immunomodulatory properties , being able to enhance the activation of different types of immune cells , which results in antitumor activities. Dendritic cells ( DCs) are pivotal in the immune response , and different immunotherapeutic approaches targeting these cells are being developed. Since little is known about the effect of lenalidomide on DCs , the goal of the present work was to investigate the phenotype and function of human monocyte-derived DCs differentiated in the presence of lenalidomide ( L-DCs). Our results showed that L-DCs display a unique phenotype , with increased cell surface expression of some maturation markers such as CD1d , CD83 , CD86 , and HLA-DR. This phenotype correlates with a lower expression of the E3 ubiquitin-ligase MARCH-I in L-DCs , upregulating the cell surface expression of CD86 and HLA-DR. In addition , immature L-DCs express higher amounts of DC-SIGN on the cell surface than control immature DCs. After LPS stimulation , production of IL-6 and TNF-α was severely decreased , whereas IL-12 and IL-10 secretion was dramatically upregulated in L-DCs , compared to that in the controls. Functionally , L-DCs are more effectively recognized by NKT cells in cytotoxicity experiments. Furthermore , L-DCs display higher opsonin-independent antigen uptake capability than control DCs. Mixed lymphocyte<symptom> reaction experiments showed that L-DCs could stimulate naïve CD4 T-cells , polarizing them toward a predominant Th1 phenotype. In summary , DCs derived from monocytes in the presence of lenalidomide present a semi-mature phenotype , increased phagocytic capacity , reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines , and the ability to polarize T-cells toward predominant Th1-type responses; these are qualities that might be useful in the development of new immunotherapeutic treatments.
