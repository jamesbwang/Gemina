 The presence of cytogenetic clonal heterogeneity has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML). Here , we reassessed this association. The study cohort consisted of all patients with an abnormal karyotype randomized in the EORTC/GIMEMA AML-10 and AML-12 trials. Abnormal karyotypes were classified as no subclones present ( cytogenetic abnormality in a single clone) , defined subclones present ( presence of one to three subclones) , and composite karyotypes ( CP) ( clonal heterogeneity not allowing enumeration of individual subclones). The main endpoints were overall survival ( OS) and disease-free survival ( DFS). Among 1291 patients with an abnormal karyotype , 1026 had no subclones , 226 at least 1 subclone , and 39 a CP. Patients with defined subclones had an OS similar to those with no subclones ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.05 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.88-1.26) , but CP patients had a shorter OS ( HR = 1.58 , 95 % CI 1.11-2.26). However , in a multivariate Cox model stratified by protocol and adjusted for age , cytogenetic risk group , secondary versus primary AML , and performance status , clonal heterogeneity lost its prognostic importance ( HR = 1.10 , 95 % CI 0.91-1.32 for defined subclones versus no subclones; HR = 0.96 , 95 % CI 0.67-1.38 for CP versus no subclones). Also , the impact of having a donor on DFS was similar in the three clonal subgroups. In summary , in patients with cytogenetic abnormality , presence of subclones had no impact on OS. The dismal outcome in patients with a CP was explained by the known predictors of poor prognosis.
