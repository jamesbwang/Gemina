 Suicide among children has been a major issue and the statistics are considerably alarming. However , no studies have been conducted in Swaziland on suicidal ideation which is a starting point for committing suicide. The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of suicidal ideation and its correlates. A secondary analysis of data was conducted using data collected in a Swaziland 2013 Global School-based Student Health Survey ( GSHS). The survey assessed among other factors , mental health of the students using a self-administered questionnaire. We considered factors that have been reported to be associated with suicidal ideation in the literature. Unadjusted odds ratios ( OR) and adjusted odds ratios ( AOR) together with their 95 confidence intervals ( CI) are reported. The overall proportions of students who considered suicide were 18.3 % of 1866 females and 15.6 % of 1672 males. In bivariate models the risk factors for suicidal ideation were feeling lonely , anxiety<symptom> , using drugs and smoking marijuana. In multivariate model to include age , gender , food security , close friends , truancy , bullied , attacked , physical fight , drugs , marijuana , parental understanding anxiety<symptom> and loneliness , all the considered factors were significantly associated with suicide except close friends. The rate of suicidal ideation was high among adolescents in Swaziland and intervention considering violence , social support from friends and parents , and drug abuse should be designed to prevent suicidal thoughts.
