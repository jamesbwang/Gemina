 Approximately 70 % of global HIV<pathogen> infections are located in sub-Saharan Africa , and the prevalence of HIV<pathogen> infection in Kenya remains high. This study examined the association between client type ( general population , commercial sex worker ( CSW) , or truck driver) and consistent condom use with steady and unsteady partners. Self-reported data included in the Kenyan Ministry of Health 2010-2011 National HIV<pathogen> Testing and Counseling Registry were used ( n = 11,567). Odds ratios ( ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were obtained using logistic regression. After adjustment , CSWs and truck drivers had decreased odds of consistent condom use with steady partners compared to the general population ( OR = 0.52; 95 % CI: 0.41-0.67 and OR = 0.29; 95 % CI: 0.13-0.63; respectively). CSWs had 1.95 times the odds of consistent condom use ( 95 % CI: 1.58-2.42) and truck drivers had 0.64 times the odds of consistent condom use with unsteady partners ( 95 % CI: 0.45-0.91) compared to the general population. Although CSWs consistently use condoms with their unsteady partners , truck drivers do not consistently use condoms with any partners. Future HIV<pathogen> prevention efforts should target CSWs and truck drivers to increase consistent condom use with all partners. Such efforts may decrease the prevalence of HIV<pathogen> in Kenya.
