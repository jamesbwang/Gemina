 Triboelectric nanogenerator ( TENG) technology is an emerging field to harvest various kinds of mechanical energies available in our living environment. Nowadays , for industrial and large-scale area applications , developing the TENG with low device processing cost and high electrical output is a major issue to be resolved. Herein , we designed a TENG with low cost by employing the microgrooved architectured ( MGA)- poly ( tetrafluoroethylene) ( PTFE; Teflon) and aluminum as triboelectric materials with opposite tendencies. Moreover , the MGA-PTFE was fabricated by a single-step , facile , and cost-effective thermal imprinting lithography technique via micropyramidal textured silicon as a master mold , fabricated by a wet-chemical etching method. Therefore , designing the TENG device by following these techniques can definitely reduce its manufacturing cost. Additionally , the electrical output of TENG was enhanced by adjusting the imprinting parameters of MGA-PTFE. Consequently , the MGA-PTFE was optimized at an imprinting pressure and temperature of 5 MPa and 280 Â°C , respectively. Thus , the TENG with an optimal MGA-PTFE polymer exhibited the highest electrical output. A robustness test of TENG was also performed , and its output power was used to drive light-emitting diodes and portable electronic devices. Finally , the real application of TENG was also examined by employing it as a smart floor and object-falling detector.
