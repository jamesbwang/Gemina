 This study explored factors predicting intention ( predominant construct in social cognitive behavioral models) for smoking cessation ( SC) counseling that may provide salient information for designing/targeting SC counseling training for physical therapists ( PTs). Cross-sectional questionnaire survey of PTs licensed to practice in Canada. Self-efficacy items and PT views were assessed for internal consistency ( Cronbach 's α) and data reduced using principal axis factor analysis. Hierarchical linear regression modeling assessed predictors of intention to counsel for SC. Internal consistency: self-efficacy and PT views: r = 0.937 , r = 0.821 , respectively. Factor structures from self-efficacy: `` skills and knowledge '' and `` clinic incidentals '' ( 57 % total variance); from PT views ': `` professional role '' and `` role modeling '' ( 63.8 % total variance). Significant predictors of intent to counsel for SC were `` professional role '' ( β = 0.54 , p ≤ 0.001) , and `` skills and knowledge '' ( β = 0.23 , p ≤ 0.001). Physical therapists ' intent to engage in SC counseling increases when they consider it their `` professional role. '' Encouraging PTs to view SC counseling as a professional role as well as increasing SC counseling self-efficacy focusing on skills and knowledge to do so needs to be incorporated into entry-level academic physical therapy programs and continuing professional PT education.
