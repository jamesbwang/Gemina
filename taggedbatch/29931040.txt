 Three recent meta-analyses found significant prospective inverse associations between chocolate intake and cardiovascular disease risk. Evidence from these meta-analyses suggests that such inverse associations may only apply to elderly individuals or those with pre-existing major chronic<disease> disease<disease>. We assessed the association between habitual chocolate intake and subsequent incident coronary heart disease ( CHD) and stroke , and the potential effect of modification by age. We conducted multivariable Cox regression analyses using data from 83,310 postmenopausal women free of baseline pre-existing major chronic<disease> disease<disease> in the prospective Women 's Health Initiative cohort. Chocolate intake was assessed using a food-frequency questionnaire. Physician-adjudicated events or deaths were ascertained up to 30 September 2013. After exclusions , there were 3246 CHD and 2624 stroke events or deaths , representing incidence rates of 3.9 % and 3.2 % during 1,098,091 and 1,101,022 person-years ( 13.4 y) , respectively. We found no association between consumption of chocolate and risk of CHD ( P for linear trend = 0.94) or stroke ( P = 0.24). The results for CHD and stroke combined were similar ( P = 0.30) , but were significantly modified by age ( P for interaction = 0.02). For women age < 65 y at baseline , those who ate 1 oz ( 28.35 g) of chocolate < 1/mo , 1 to < 1.5/ mo , 1.5 to < 3.5/ mo , 3.5/ mo to < 3/wk , and â‰¥ 3/wk had HRs ( 95 % CIs) of 1.00 ( referent) , 1.17 ( 1.00 , 1.36) , 1.05 ( 0.90 , 1.22) , 1.09 ( 0.94 , 1.25) , and 1.27 ( 1.09 , 1.49) , respectively ( P for linear trend = 0.005). No association was apparent for older women. We observed no association between chocolate intake and risk of CHD , stroke , or both combined in participants free of pre-existing major chronic<disease> disease<disease>. The relation for both combined was modified by age , with a significant positive linear trend and an increased risk in the highest quintile of chocolate consumption among women age < 65 y. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03453073.
