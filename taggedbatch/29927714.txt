 Gay bars have long been understood as havens from heteronormativity. However , a shift towards greater LGBTQ tolerance has led to more heterosexual involvement in these once marginal places. Such shifts towards ` post-gay ' identity politics have called into question the queerness of many LGBTQ-oriented social outlets. This paper illustrates how rhetorical marketing and aesthetic choices lead some venues to develop reputations as questionably queer spaces-reputations that are created and negotiated by patrons as they evaluate these venues ' ultimate functionality in relation to their own increasingly uncertain ideals about the form and desirability of queer spaces. By examining how divergent configurations of queerness mediate the ambivalence many LGBTQ people feel about these places and the straight people who occupy them , we can further our knowledge about how queer space operates today without getting trapped within the homonormative/queer dichotomy that limits much pre-existing research.
