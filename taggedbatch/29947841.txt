 To investigate the risk factors for residual pivot shift test after anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL) reconstruction based on a multicenter prospective cohort study. This study included patients who were registered in the Multicenter Arthroscopic Knee Surgery Study , a prospective longitudinal multicenter cohort study , and who underwent primary ACL reconstruction using autologous hamstring tendon graft between 2013 and 2016. The exclusion criteria included prior injuries or surgeries in the contralateral knee , prior ligamentous injuries in the involved knee , grade 2 or 3 concomitant ligament injuries , and inflammatory or other forms of osteoarthritis. Data from the preoperative period and at 1-year follow-up were used for further analysis , and patients with incomplete data , re-injury and loss to follow-up were also excluded. Logistic regression analysis was conducted with age , gender , Lachman test , pivot shift test , KT measurement , hyperextension , single-bundle vs. double-bundle , meniscus injury sites , and meniscus treatments as the independent variables , and postoperative pivot shift test was used as the dependent variable. Three hundred and sixty-eight patients were included in the study. Hyperextension knee ( P = 0.025) and a preoperative pivot shift test under anesthesia ( P = 0.040) were identified as risk factors for a postoperative pivot shift via logistic regression analysis. There were no statistically significant differences in the other variables. The results from a multicenter cohort study indicated that knee hyperextension and greater preoperative pivot shift under anesthesia were risk factors for residual pivot shift at 1 year after ACL reconstruction. In cases with a preoperative high-grade pivot shift and knee hyperextension , additional anterolateral structure augmentation might be considered in order to eliminate pivot shift and eventually obtain better outcomes after ACL reconstruction.
