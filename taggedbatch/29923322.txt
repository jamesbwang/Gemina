 In the present meta-analysis , we aimed to determine the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor ( SGLT-2i) in addition to insulin therapy on cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes patients. Randomized controlled trials were identified by searching the PubMed , Embase and Cochrane Library databases published before September 2017. The intervention group received SGLT-2i as add-on treatment to insulin therapy , and the control group received placebos in addition to insulin. We assessed pooled data , including weighted mean differences and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) using a random-effects model. A total of 10 randomized controlled trials ( n = 5,159) were eligible. The weighted mean differences for systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> were -3.17 mmHg ( 95 % CI -4.53 , -1.80 , I The results showed that in the intervention group , greater reductions were achieved for blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , glucose control , uric acid and bodyweight. This treatment regimen might therefore provide beneficial effects on the occurrence and development of cardiovascular events.
