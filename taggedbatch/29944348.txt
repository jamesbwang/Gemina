 Cellulose nanocrystals hydrolyzed by hydrochloric acid and esterified by acetic acid produce acetylated cellulose nanocrystals ( CNC-AA) with acetyl ester surface functional groups. While much attention has been paid to understanding the phase behavior ( liquid crystal) of aqueous dispersions of sulfonated nanocrystals , relatively few studies have focused on CNC-AA dispersions. CNC-AA dispersions exhibit multiple phase regimes and markedly different phase behavior due to their lower surface charge. At concentrations above 5.0 Ã— 10
