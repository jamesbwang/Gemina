 Autosomal-dominant optic atrophy ( ADOA) is one of the most common types of inherited optic atrophy. We identify OPA1 pathogenic variants and assess the clinical features of a cohort of Chinese ADOA patients Materials and Methods: Detailed clinical evaluations were performed and genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood for all the participants. Sanger sequencing was used to analyze all exons and exon/intron junctions of OPA1 for eight pedigrees. Target exome capture plus next-generation sequencing ( NGS) were applied for one atypical family with photophobia<symptom>. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was carried out to further characterize the mRNA change of selected splicing alteration. All 17 patients had impaired<symptom> vision<symptom> and optic-disk pallor; however , the clinical severity varied markedly. Two patients complicated with hearing loss. Six novel and two reported pathogenic variants in OPA1 ( GenBank Accession No. NM_130837.2) were identified including four nonsynonymous variants ( c. 2400T > G , c. 1468T > C , c. 1567A > G and c. 1466T > C) , two splicing variants ( c.2984-1 _ 2986delGAGA and c. 2983 + 5G > A) , one small deletion ( c. 2960_2968delGCGTTCAAC) , and one small insertion ( c. 3009_3010insA). RNA analysis revealed the splicing variant c.2984-1 _ 2986delGAGA caused small deletion of mRNA ( r. 2983_2988del). ADOA patients presented variable clinical manifestations. Novel OPA1 pathogenic variants are the main genetic defect for Chinese ADOA cases. NGS may be a useful molecular testing tool for atypical ADOA.
