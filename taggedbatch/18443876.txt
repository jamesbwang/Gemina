 Radiologic assessment plays a vital role in the management of diverticulitis. It not only helps in the diagnosis , but also helps to guide the management. As technology has progressed , different modalities have offered insight into the treatment of this disease process. Through various trials and studies , certain modalities stand above the rest in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Computed tomography ( CT) imaging has also proved to help us guide the management through a grading system. Newer studies show us the advantages of other modalities such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). Though there is much research yet to be done with these modalities , they do show a lot of potential.
