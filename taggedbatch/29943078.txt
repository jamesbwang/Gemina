 Because of demographic changes the nursing care sector is faced with a lack of qualified employees in the medium and long term. The shortage in the work force is caused by high workloads and unfavorable working conditions. In response to this shortage , there have been attempts to recruit qualified nursing staff from abroad and also to improve the integration of people with a migration background living in Germany into the job market. Based on a quantitative cross-sectional study of 366 nurses , the psychosocial burden and strains among employees with a migration background ( n = 112) and without a migration background ( n = 254) were examined. For this purpose , 13 scales of the German version of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire ( COPSOQ) were used for the assessment of psychosocial factors at work. The results were compared with professional group-specific reference values ( geriatric care) from the COPSOQ database. The comparison of nursing staff with and without a migration background revealed that the emotional demands , work-privacy conflict and role conflicts factors received a significantly better rating among nursing staff with a migration background , while development opportunities were rated worse by this population group. The surveyed nursing staff exhibited higher stress values compared to the COPSOQ reference group in almost all scales. Nursing staff with a migration background need to be supported with respect to development opportunities. Suitable education and training measures may offer adequate career perspectives and may encourage employees to stay in their jobs.
