 Evidence of the adverse neurological effects of exposure to ambient air pollution is emerging , but little is known about its effect on the development of multiple sclerosis ( MS) , the most common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. To investigate the associations between MS incidence and long-term exposures to fine particles ( PM Between 2001 and 2013 , we identified 6203 incident cases of MS. The adjusted HR of incident MS was 0.96 ( 95 % CI: 0.86-1.07) for PM In this large population-based cohort , we did not observe significant associations between MS incidence and long-term exposures to PM
