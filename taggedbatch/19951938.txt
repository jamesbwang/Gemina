 We estimated small arterial elasticity and used linear regression to evaluate its association with inflammatory biomarkers among antiretroviral therapy-na√Øve , HIV-positive patients with high CD4 + counts. After adjustment , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were inversely associated with small arterial elasticity. These data suggest that systemic inflammation<symptom> may contribute to vascular dysfunction even in very early HIV<pathogen> disease.
