 We performed lumbar spinal magnetic resonance imaging of three-dimensional ( 3D) dual echo volumetric isotropic turbo<pathogen> spin echo acquisition ( DE-VISTA) and constructed DE-VISTA additional fusion images ( DE-VISTA-AFI) , which is the addition of DE-VISTA proton density-weighted images ( DE-VISTA-PDWI) to DE-VISTA T2-weighted images ( DE-VISTA-T2WI). The aim of this study was to clarify whether DE-VISTA-AFI was able to clearly delineate spinal nerve roots. A total of 677 patients underwent lumbar MR imaging , and the signal ratio ( SR) between cerebrospinal fluid and nerve roots inside the dural sac and the SR between fat and nerve roots outside the dural sac were estimated using DE-VISTA-AFI , DE-VISTA-PDWI , DE-VISTA-T2WI , and 2D-T2WI. The SR between cerebrospinal fluid and nerve roots inside the dural sac on DE-VISTA-AFI was higher than that on DE-VISTA-PDWI ( p < 0.0001) and on 2D T2WI ( p < 0.0001). The SR between the fat tissue and nerve roots outside the dural sac on DE-VISTA-AFI was higher than that on DE-VISTA-PDWI ( p < 0.0001) and 2D T2WI ( p < 0.0001). DE-VISTA-AFI could clearly delineate the entire length of the lumbar nerve roots that run from the cauda equina<pathogen> in the spinal fluid through to the fat in the lateral recess , intervertebral foramen , and outside the intervertebral foramen.
