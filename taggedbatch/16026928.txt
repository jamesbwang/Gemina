 We present a case of a young female with a slowly progressing visual impairment who was examined with multifocal visual evoked potentials and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) for underlying neuronal abnormality. The fMRI examination consisted of presenting black-and-white checkerboard stimuli , and her activation patterns were compared to the patterns from 4 normal-sighted subjects. The results showed clear differences in neuronal activation between the patient and the controls in the occipital and parietal lobes. Although we have shown neuronal correlates in a case of unexplained visual loss , it is still an open question as to whether this has an organic or functional cause , which should be the subject for future research.
