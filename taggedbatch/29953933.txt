 Antipsychotic drugs are the primary treatment for psychosis , yet individual response to their administration remains variable. At present , no biological predictors of response exist to guide clinicians as they select treatments for patients , and our understanding of the neurobiology underlying the heterogeneity of outcomes remains limited. Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI) has been applied by numerous studies to examine the response to antipsychotic treatment , though a large gap remains between their results and our clinical practice. To advance patient care with precision medicine approaches , prior work must be accounted for and built upon with future studies. This review provides an overview of studies that relate treatment outcome to various MRI-related measures , including structural , spectroscopic , diffusion tensor , and functional imaging. Knowledge derived from these studies will be discussed along with future directions for the field.
