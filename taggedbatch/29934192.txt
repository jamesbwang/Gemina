 To update the current situation on salt , fat and fatty acid composition of processed foods , a study including a wide range of different food categories was conducted in Portugal. Different validated analytical techniques were used , and a PCA and correlation analysis were conducted to establish a trend between the different components in each food category. The highest salt content was found in snacks , fast-food , sauces and ready-to-eat meals , while the saturated fatty acids were higher ( p < .05) in bakery products , cookies , biscuits and wafers , and snacks. The highest levels of trans fatty acids were found in the fast-food group , followed by the snacks , potato and potato-products and bakery products. A significant positive correlation ( p < .05) was found between salt and fat content in ready-to-eat meals and in the potato and potato-products. The PCA analysis identified total fat , low trans fatty acids and high salt content as distinctive characteristics of some food categories.
