 Neuromuscular control deficit has been reported in people with chronic ankle instability ( CAI) and hopping exercises have been recommended as a functional training tool to prevent lower limb injury , but its effects on lower extremity neuromuscular control in those with CAI are unclear. To investigate the effect of hop stabilization training on neuromuscular control and self-reported function in collegiate basketball players with CAI. A randomized controlled trial. Research Laboratory. Patients ( or Other Participants): Twenty-eight college basketball players with CAI were randomly assigned to the experimental hop stabilization group ( age 22.78 ± 3.09 years , weight 82.59 ± 9.51 kg , height 187.96 ± 7.93 cm) or the control group ( age 22.57 ± 2.76 years , weight 78.35 ± 7.02 kg , height 185.69 ± 7.28 cm). Participants in the experimental group performed supervised hop stabilization exercises 3 times per week for 6 weeks. The control group received no intervention. Preparatory and reactive muscle activation levels and muscle onset time were assessed from eight lower extremity muscles during a jump landing task before and after the 6-week training program. Significant improvements in preparatory muscle activation , reactive muscle activation , and muscle onset time were noted across the lower extremity in the experimental group relative to the control group ( p < 0.05). Self-reported function also improved in the experimental group relative to the control group ( p < 0.05). These findings demonstrate that 6-weeks of hop stabilization training is effective in improving neuromuscular control and self-reported function in collegiate basketball players with CAI. Hop stabilization exercises can be incorporated into rehabilitation program for CAI.
