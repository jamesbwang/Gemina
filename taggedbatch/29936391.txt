 Newborn irritability<symptom> could be an unique and special status and/or adverse neurobehavioral outcomes which was independent of serious disease. To determine whether maternal perinatal anxiety<symptom> symptoms was associated with newborn irritability<symptom> , and whether the alteration of serum prolactin in newborns were involved in newborn irritability<symptom>. 205 pregnant women were recruited: normal group ( n = 100) , and anxiety<symptom> group ( n = 105) , which was randomly divided to Newborn Behavioral Observations ( NBO) + anxiety<symptom> group ( n = 65) and control + anxiety<symptom> group ( n = 40). Newborn Irritability<symptom> was assessed by Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale ( NBAS). Serum prolactin , cortisol and 5-HT in mothers and infants were measured. 1. The scores of irritability<symptom> items in the newborns of anxiety<symptom> group were higher than that of the normal group ( p < 0.05). 2. Lower serum PRL , 5-HT and higher serum cortisol were found in the newborns of anxiety<symptom> group compared with that of the control group both postpartum 2d and 15 ( p < 0.05). 3. The level of serum PRL in newborn infants were significantly and negatively correlated to the scores of irritability<symptom> items ( p < 0.05). 4. After 7 rounds of NBO interventions , the anxiety<symptom> scores of mothers and the scores of irritability<symptom> items of newborns in the NBO intervention group were all lower than those of the control group ( p < 0.05). In future experiments , we should explore the effect of PRL in the breast milk on newborn infant serum PRL. Prolactin could be a potential mediator in newborn irritability<symptom> following maternal perinatal anxiety<symptom> symptoms.
