 Background Deprescribing medication may be in response to an adverse clinical trigger ( reactive) or if future gains are unlikely to outweigh future harms ( proactive). A hospital admission may present an opportunity for deprescribing , however current practice is poorly understood. Objective To quantify and describe the nature of deprescribing in a UK teaching hospital. Method Prescribing and discontinuation data for admission medication from a hospital 's electronic prescribing system were extracted over 4 weeks. The rationale for discontinuation of a random sample of 200 was determined using medical records. This informed categorisation of deprescribing activity by clinicians into ` proactive ' or ` reactive '. Data were extrapolated to estimate the proportion of admission medications deprescribed and the proportion which were reactive and proactive. Results From 24,552 admission medicines , 977 discontinuations were recorded. Of the 200 discontinuations sampled for review , only 44 ( 22.0 %) were confirmed deprescribing activities; categorised into 7 ( 15.9 %) proactive and 37 ( 84.1 %) reactive. Extrapolation yielded 0.6 % ( 95 % CI 0.5-0.7 %) of all admission medications deprescribed. Conclusion Limited deprescribing activity , dominated by reactive behaviour was identified , suggesting prescribers require a clinical trigger to prompt deprescribing. There may be scope for increasing proactive deprescribing in hospital , however the extent to which this is feasible is unknown.
