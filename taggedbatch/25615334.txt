 We theoretically investigate the light scattering of super- and subradiant states of an atomic ring prepared by single excitation with a photon which carries an orbital angular momentum ( OAM). For excitations with linear polarizations , the helical phase imprinted ( HPI) atomic ring presents a discrete C
