 To evaluate in details the actual extent of double-J stent-related symptoms after semirigid ( URS) and flexible ( RIRS) ureteroscopy using a validated questionnaire. We asked to complete the Ureteric Stent Symptoms Questionnaire ( USSQ) to all stone patients undergoing URS or RIRS with stent placement from 2010 to 2015. Stent-related symptoms ' prevalence , severity , and impact on daily life were analyzed using descriptive statistics and five-order Likert scales. Subgroups analyses were performed. 232 patients completed the USSQ. Stents had a deep impact on urinary<symptom> symptoms<symptom> ( daily frequency ≥ 1 per hour 59.1 % , ≥ 1 nocturnal micturition 90.1 % , urgency 86.6 % , burning 82.3 %) that represented a problem for 88.4 % of patients. 83.2 % complained of pain , mostly in the kidney ( 67.9 %) or in the bladder area ( 31.3 %) , particularly during physical activity ( 72.9 %) and micturition ( 77.0 %). Pain interfered with everyday life in 92.2 %. General health , working , and sexual activity were also affected. 62.0 % of patients would be dissatisfied ( 51.6 % unhappy or terrible) if further ureteral stenting was proposed in future. Younger patients and females were more affected. Limitations include observational design and lack of baseline evaluation. Ureteral stents are responsible for significant urinary<symptom> symptoms<symptom> and pain after semirigid and flexible ureteroscopy. They also considerably affect general health , working and sexual activity. Urologists should consider it carefully before stenting , inform patients about stent-related symptoms , and minimize stent indwelling time.
