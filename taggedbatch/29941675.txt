 Obese men have lower serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) than comparably aged lean men , but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of obesity on PSA and the potential contributing mechanisms. A cohort of 1195 men aged 35 years and over at recruitment , with demographic , anthropometric ( body mass index ( BMI) , waist circumference ( WC)) and serum hormone ( serum testosterone ( T) , estradiol ( E2)) , PSA and hematology assessments obtained over two waves was assessed. Men with a history of prostate cancer or missing PSA were excluded , leaving 970 men for the final analysis. Mixed-effects regressions and mediation analyses adjusting for hormonal and volumetric factors explore the potential mechanisms relating obesity to PSA. After adjusting for age , PSA levels were lower in men with greater WC ( p = 0.001). In a multivariable model including WC , age , E2/T and PlasV as predictors , no statistically significant associations were observed between with PSA and either WC ( p = 0.36) or PlasV ( p = 0.49) , while strong associations were observed with both E2/T ( p < 0.001) and age ( p < 0.001). In the mediation analyses with PlasV as the mediator , the average causal mediation effect ( ACME) explained roughly 0.2 of the total effect of WC on PSA ( p = 0.31) , while when E2/T is a mediator; the ACME explained roughly 0.5 of the effect ( p < 0.001). Our findings indicate that lower PSA levels in obese men , as compared to normal weight men , can be explained both by hormonal changes ( elevated E2/T ratio) and haemodilution. Hormonal factors therefore represent a substantial but underappreciated mediating pathway.
