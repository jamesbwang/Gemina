 Wnt signaling plays important roles in a variety of developmental and pathological processes. Here we show that Wntless , the main regulator for Wnt secretion , is involved in the innate immune response of the giant freshwater prawn<disease> , Macrobrachium rosenbergii. The full-length cDNA of the prawn<disease> Wntless ( named MrWntless) is 2173 bp in length and contains a 1602-bp open reading frame ( ORF<pathogen>) , which is conceptually translated into a 533-amino acids sequence. MrWntless protein contains a highly conserved Wnt-binding domain which is required for secretion of Wnt ligands , and exhibits 57-67 % identity with known Wntless proteins of other animals. MrWntless was found to be expressed in a variety of prawn tissues including heart , gill , muscle , gut , hepatopancreas and ovary. Moreover , MrWntless expression was significantly increased in the hepatopancreas and gill of the prawns<disease> challenged by the bacterial pathogen Aeromonas<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> and Vibrio<pathogen> parahaemolyticus<pathogen>. Knockdown of MrWntless by RNA interference in prawns<disease> led to dramatically decreased MrWntless expression of approximately 70 %. Furthermore , the cumulative mortality rate of the prawn<disease> injected with MrWntless dsRNA was greatly increased in response to A.<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> challenge compared with the control prawns<disease>. Taken together , we provide evidence that prawn<disease> Wntless is important for their innate immune response against bacterial pathogens.
