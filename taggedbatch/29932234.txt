 Acute kidney injury is mostly reversible , and hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF) has a relevant role in the tissue repair. MicroRNA ( miR) -26 a is an endogenous modulator of HGF. The role of miR-26a in the kidney repair process was evaluated in Wistar rats submitted to an acute kidney injury model of rhabdomyolysis induced by glycerol ( 6 mL/kg). Animals were evaluated 3 , 12 , 48 , 96 , and 120 hours after glycerol injection. Serum creatinine ( SCr) and gene expression of HGF , c-met , signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3) , and miR-26a were estimated. Also , tubular NK52E cells were transfected with anti-miR26a and stimulated with Fe
