 There are controversial results regarding the effect of the interaction of CETP polymorphisms with dietary fats on the lipid profiles. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of CETP polymorphisms ( rs5882 and rs3764261) and macronutrient intakes interaction in relation to metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> ( MetS) or its components. In this nested case-control study , subjects were selected from among participants of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study. Cases ( n = 441) were individually matched with two controls ( 844 non-MetS subjects). DNA samples were genotyped with HumanOmniExpress-24-v1-0 bead chips , including 649,932 SNP loci. The mean ages at baseline were 38.1 ± 10 and 37.0 ± 10 years in women and 36.2 ± 11 and 36.3 ± 11 years in men , respectively in cases and controls. We did not find significant gene-diet interactions between rs5882 and dietary macronutrient intakes in relation to MetS risk. The risk of low HDL-C was lower in the first quartile of MUFA and total fat intake in G allele carriers , compared to AA genotype group. The risk of high BP appeared to increase significantly in higher quartiles of trans-fatty acid intakes ( > 1.81 % of total energy intake) in G allele carriers compared with the AA genotype group. No significant interactions were found between rs3764261 and macronutrient intakes in association with MetS or its components. Our findings demonstrate that dietary fats modify the association of rs5882 and risk of low HDL-C and high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>.
