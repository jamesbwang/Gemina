 We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the outcomes of acute ischemic stroke ( AIS) in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy ( MT) , according to diabetes mellitus and admission glucose level ( AGL). We systematically reviewed previous studies in PubMed that reported outcomes of MT in AIS patients and their relationships with diabetes mellitus or AGL. We used functional independence ( modified Rankin score â‰¤ 2 at 3 months) as the primary end point. Data from 12,653 patients in 47 articles that evaluated the effect of diabetes mellitus or AGL on outcomes after MT were included. Compared with patients without a history of diabetes mellitus , patients with a diabetes mellitus history had significantly lower odds of functional independence in both the unadjusted meta-analysis ( odds ratio ( OR) 0.64; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.54-0.75) and the multivariable analysis ( OR 0.48; 95 % CI 0.33-0.71). Similarly , higher AGL was associated with an unfavorable functional outcome in the unadjusted meta-analysis ( pooled effect size- 0.38; 95 % CI- 0.45 to- 0.31) , and the adjusted OR ( 95 % CI) per 1 mmol/L increase in AGL was 0.87 ( 0.83-0.92) for functional independence according to the combined multivariable results. Recanalization rate and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> were neither related to AGL nor different in patients with or without diabetes mellitus. The present study confirms that a history of diabetes mellitus and high AGL are associated with unfavorable functional outcomes at 3 months after MT in AIS patients. However , the causal relationship between hyperglycemia and poor prognosis remains undetermined , and further investigations are required to ascertain whether AIS patients receiving MT could benefit from intensive glucose control.
