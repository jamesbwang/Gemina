 Progressive<symptom> movement<symptom> of spermatozoa has conventionally been regarded as a good indicator of motility. However , bull spermatozoa exhibit two types of progressive<symptom> movement<symptom>: progressive/planar movement without rotation and progressive/helical movement with rotation. The aim of this study was to reconsider the evaluation criteria of bull ejaculated sperm motility in the context of rotation. Here , we compared the movement patterns of ejaculated spermatozoa with relatively high and low protein kinase A ( PKA)- mediated signaling activities , because sperm motility is positively regulated by PKA-mediated signaling activities. We prepared sperm samples with high and low PKA-mediated signaling activities by suspending spermatozoa in media containing either the stimulator ( NaHCO
