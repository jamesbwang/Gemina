 Study Design Clinical measurement study. Background The Lumbar Spine Instability Questionnaire ( LSIQ) is a self-report measure of 15 items. Previous studies have used the LSIQ as a measure of clinical instability; however , a comprehensive evaluation of its clinimetric properties has not been conducted. Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinimetric properties of the LSIQ in patients with chronic non-specific low<symptom> back pain ( LBP). Methods We included patients with non-specific LBP presenting to primary care clinicians in Australia. Rasch analysis was conducted to assess item hierarchy , targeting , unidimensionality , person fit , internal consistency and differential item functioning. We also tested test-retest reliability for total scores and each item , and convergent and divergent validity. Results A total of 107 participants with LBP were recruited ( 60 men and 47 women). The results were variable. The LSIQ appeared to constitute a unidimensional measure , targeted the sample well and showed adequate test-retest reliability. However , the scale had poor internal consistency , did not appear to function as an interval-level measure and had unclear construct validity. Although no items appeared to be redundant , several items were biased by factors other than the proposed construct of the measure. Conclusions The LSIQ does not seem ready to be implemented in clinical practice. We suggest a theoretical reconsideration of this questionnaire. Although the LSIQ provided satisfactory estimates for some clinimetric features , we can not consider it as an internal-level measure but rather an index. Future studies are needed to investigate whether the LSIQ measures clinical instability or some other construct. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther , Epub 22 Jun 2018. doi: 10.2519/ jospt .2018.7866.
