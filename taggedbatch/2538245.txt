 The prognosis of patients with recurrent World Health Organization ( WHO) grade IV malignant glioma is dismal , and there is currently no effective therapy. We conducted a dose-finding and toxicity study in this population of patients , evaluating convection-enhanced , intratumoral delivery of the recombinant nonpathogenic polio-rhinovirus chimera ( PVSRIPO). PVSRIPO recognizes the poliovirus<pathogen> receptor CD155 , which is widely expressed in neoplastic cells of solid tumors and in major components of the tumor microenvironment. We enrolled consecutive adult patients who had recurrent supratentorial WHO grade IV malignant glioma , confirmed on histopathological testing , with measurable disease ( contrast-enhancing tumor of ≥ 1 cm and ≤ 5.5 cm in the greatest dimension). The study evaluated seven doses , ranging between 10 From May 2012 through May 2017 , a total of 61 patients were enrolled and received a dose of PVSRIPO. Dose level -1 ( 5.0 × 10 Intratumoral infusion of PVSRIPO in patients with recurrent WHO grade IV malignant glioma confirmed the absence of neurovirulent potential. The survival rate among patients who received PVSRIPO immunotherapy was higher at 24 and 36 months than the rate among historical controls.
