 We report a discovery of a new rimantadine ( 1- ( 1-adamantyl) ethanamine)- derived chiral ligand and its application for the preparation of Î±-amino acids using the second-order asymmetric transformation approach. The operational ease of experimental procedures coupled with excellent chemical yields and stereochemical outcome suggests some potential synthetic generality of this approach.
