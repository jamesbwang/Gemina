 In our effort to develop novel and powerful agents with anti-proliferative activity , two new series of 1H-benzo ( f) chromene derivatives , 4a-h and 6a-h , were synthesised using heterocyclocondensation methodologies under microwave irradiation condition. The structures of the target compounds were established on the basis of their spectral data , IR ,
