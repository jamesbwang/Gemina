 To evaluate the effects and mechanism of the Dexmedetomidine on the levels of proinflammatory mediators interleukin 1 beta ( IL-1β) and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) in ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R) rats. Fifty healthy SPF male SD rats , 250 ~ 310 g ,8 ~ 12 weeks , were randomly divided into five groups ( Compared with the sham group , the W/D 、 TLW 、 IL-1β and TNF-α in other groups were increased significantly ( Dexmedetomidine can alleviate ischemia/reperfusion injury in rat lung through lowering the level of proinflammatory mediators IL-1β and TNF-α , the possible mechanism may be through stimulation of α
