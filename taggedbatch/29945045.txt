 The Quorum Sensing ( QS) system has attracted the interest of researchers as a cell-cell communication system. In activated sludge processes , the production of extracellular polymeric substances ( EPS) , biofilms and floc formation are regulated by the QS system. Hence , disruption of the QS system , called Quorum Quenching ( QQ) , could have a significant effect on the quality and quantity of excess sludge. In the present research , the quorum quenching bacteria , Rhodococcus<pathogen> sp.. BH4 was used as a quorum quencher and was entrapped in an alginate structure ( QQ beads). Three separate sequential batch reactors ( SBR) were constructed and operated as a control reactor , a Low-QQ reactor ( containing 150 QQ beads) , and a High-QQ reactor ( containing 600 QQ beads). Results indicated that the presence of QQ beads in the aeration reactor leads to a decrease in EPS content and mean floc particle size in the both Low-QQ and High-QQ reactors. The eukaryotic community was changed significantly so that the QS disruption caused an enhancement in microbial predation. The presence of QQ beads also led to a 16 and a 26 % decrease in the Y
