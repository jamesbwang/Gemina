 Oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress are related states that can occur in cells as part of normal physiology but occur frequently in diseases involving inflammation<symptom>. In this article , we review recent findings relating to the role of oxidative and ER stress in the pathophysiology of acute and chronic nonmalignant diseases of the lung , including infections , cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> , idiopathic pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> and asthma. We also explore the potential of drugs targeting oxidative and ER stress pathways to alleviate disease.
