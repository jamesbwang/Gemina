 We investigated HSP90α as screening biomarker for early colorectal cancer ( CRC). Seventy-seven CRC patients and 78 healthy controls were enrolled. Plasma HSP90α was significantly higher in CRC patients than in healthy controls ( p < 0.05). levels were higher in late ( stages III and IV) CRC than in early ( stages I and II) CRC ( p = 0.022). HSP90α conferred an advantage in the diagnosis of early CRC. Combination of HSP90α and carcinoembryonic antigen improved the diagnostic sensitivity ( 84.4 %) and specificity ( 89.5 %) for CRC ( area under the curve: 0.968); for early CRC , the sensitivity was 82.5 % and specificity was 89.5 % ( area under the curve: 0.955). HSP90 is a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of early CRC.
