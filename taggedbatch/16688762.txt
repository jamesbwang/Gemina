 Recurrent urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> are associated with uropathogenic RT4 bladder cells were preconditioned with high molecular weight HA ( > 1500 kDa) at 2 mg mL Microscopic analyses showed reduced bacterial adherence and urothelial disruption with HA , suggesting that HA functions as a barrier protecting the epithelium from bacterial infection. Cells treated with HA and flagellin simultaneously produced more of the host antimicrobial peptide LCN2 and pro-inflammatory IL-8 ( These data suggest that exogenous HA has potential to protect the urogenital epithelia from UPEC infection via a two-pronged approach that involves the physical enhancement of the epithelial barrier and augmentation of its innate immune response.
