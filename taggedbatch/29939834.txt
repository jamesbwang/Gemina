 Doxorubicin ( DXR) , which is produced by Streptomyces<pathogen> peucetius , is an important anthracycline-type antibiotic used for the treatment of various cancers. However , due to the low DXR productivity of wild-type S. peucetius , it is difficult to produce DXR by one-step fermentation. In this study , a DXR-resistance screening method was developed to screen for DXR high-producing mutants. Then , S. peucetius SIPI-11 was treated several times with UV and ARTP ( atmospheric and room temperature plasma) to induce mutations. Treated strains were screened by spreading on a DXR-containing plate , isolating a mutant ( S. peucetius 33-24) with enhanced DXR yield ( 570 mg/L vs. 119 mg/L for the original strain). The components of the fermentation medium , including the carbon and nitrogen sources , were optimized to further enhance DXR yield ( to 850 mg/L). The pH of the fermentation medium and culture temperature were also optimized for effective DXR production. Finally , DXR production by S. peucetius 33-24 was investigated in flask culture and a fermenter. The yield of DXR was as high as 1100 mg/L in a 5-L fermenter , which is the highest DXR productivity reported thus far , suggesting that S. peucetius 33-24 has the potential to produce DXR by direct fermentation.
