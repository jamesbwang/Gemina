 Low-intensity venous blood flow restriction ( vBFR) resistance training has been shown to promote increases in muscle strength and size. Eccentric-only muscle actions are typically a more potent stimulus to increase muscle strength and size than concentric-only muscle actions performed at the same relative intensities. Therefore , the purpose of this investigation was to examine the time-course of changes in muscle strength , hypertrophy , and neuromuscular adaptations following 4 weeks of unilateral forearm flexion low-intensity eccentric vBFR ( Ecc-vBFR) vs. low-intensity concentric vBFR ( Con-vBFR) resistance training performed at the same relative intensity. Thirty-six women were randomly assigned to either Ecc-vBFR ( n = 12) , Con-vBFR ( n = 12) or control ( no intervention , n = 12) group. Ecc-vBFR trained at 30 % of eccentric peak torque and Con-vBFR trained at 30 % of concentric peak torque. All training and testing procedures were performed at an isokinetic velocity of 120 Â° s Muscle strength increased similarly from 0 to 2 and 4 weeks of training as a result of Ecc-vBFR ( 13.9 and 35.0 %) and Con-vBFR ( 13.4 and 31.2 %) , but there were no changes in muscle strength for the control group. Muscle thickness increased similarly from 0 to 2 and 4 weeks of training as a result of Ecc-vBFR ( 11.4 and 12.8 %) and Con-vBFR ( 9.1 and 9.9 %) , but there were no changes for the control group. In addition , there were no changes in any of the neuromuscular responses. The Ecc-vBFR and Con-vBFR low-intensity training induced comparable increases in muscle strength and size. The increases in muscle strength , however , were not associated with neuromuscular adaptations.
