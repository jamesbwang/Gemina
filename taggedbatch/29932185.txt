 The development of multi-dimensional statistical methods has been demonstrated on variable contact time ( VCT) 29Si ( 1H) cross-polarization magic angle spinning ( CP/MAS) data sets collected using Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill ( CPMG) type acquisition. These methods utilize the transformation of the collected 2D VCT data set into a 3D data set and use tensor-rank decomposition to extract the spectral components that vary as a function of transverse relaxation time ( T2) and CP contact time. The result is a data dense spectral set that can be used to reconstruct CP/MAS spectra at any contact time with a high signal to noise ratio and with an excellent agreement to 29Si ( 1H) CP/MAS spectra collected using conventional acquisition. These CPMG data can be collected in a fraction of time that would be required to collect a conventional VCT data set. We demonstrate the method on samples of functionalized mesoporous silica materials and show that the method can provide valuable surface specific information about their functional chemistry.
