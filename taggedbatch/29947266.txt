 The growing complexity and volume of clinical data and the associated decision-making processes in oncology promote the advent of precision medicine. Precision ( or personalised) medicine describes preventive and/or treatment procedures that take individual patient variability into account when proscribing treatment , and has been hindered in the past by the strict requirements of accurate , robust , repeatable and preferably non-invasive biomarkers to stratify both the patient and the disease. In oncology , tumour subtypes are traditionally measured through repeated invasive biopsies , which are taxing for the patient and are cost and labour intensive. Quantitative analysis of routine clinical imaging provides an opportunity to capture tumour heterogeneity non-invasively , cost-effectively and on large scale. In current clinical practice radiological images are qualitatively analysed by expert radiologists whose interpretation is known to suffer from inter- and intra-operator variability. Radiomics , the high-throughput mining of image features from medical images , provides a quantitative and robust method to assess tumour heterogeneity , and radiomics-based signatures provide a powerful tool for precision medicine in cancer treatment. This study aims to provide an overview of the current state of radiomics as a precision medicine decision support tool. We first provide an overview of the requirements and challenges radiomics currently faces in being incorporated as a tool for precision medicine , followed by an outline of radiomics ' current applications in the treatment of various types of cancer. We finish with a discussion of possible future advances that can further develop radiomics as a precision medicine tool.
