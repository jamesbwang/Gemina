 This study intended to investigate the interactions between accident rate and traffic signs in state roads located in Croatia , and accommodate the heterogeneity attributed to unobserved factors. The data from 130 state roads between 2012 and 2016 were collected from Traffic Accident Database System maintained by the Republic of Croatia Ministry of the Interior. To address the heterogeneity , a panel quantile regression model was proposed , in which quantile regression model offers a more complete view and a highly comprehensive analysis of the relationship between accident rate and traffic signs , while the panel data model accommodates the heterogeneity attributed to unobserved factors. Results revealed that ( 1) low visibility of material damage ( MD) and death or injured ( DI) increased the accident rate; ( 2) the number of mandatory signs and the number of warning signs were more likely to reduce the accident rate; ( 3) average speed limit and the number of invalid traffic signs per km exhibited a high accident rate. To our knowledge , it 's the first attempt to analyze the interactions between accident consequences and traffic signs by employing a panel quantile regression model; by involving the visibility , the present study demonstrates that the low visibility causes a relatively higher risk of MD and DI; It is noteworthy that average speed limit corresponds with accident rate positively; The number of mandatory signs and the number of warning signs are more likely to reduce the accident rate; The number of invalid traffic signs per km are significant for accident rate , thus regular maintenance should be kept for a safer roadway environment.
