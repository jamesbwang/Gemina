 The abdominal compartment syndrome<disease><symptom> ( ACS) has been clearly identified as being one of the main causes of mortality after ruptured abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> ( rAAA). The ACS is defined as a sustained intra-abdominal pressure > 20 mm Hg associated with a new organ dysfunction or failure. A pilot study was conducted and found that the threshold of 3 among 8 selected criteria , we would predict an ACS occurrence with a 54 % positive predictive value and a 92 % negative predictive value. But a multicentric prospective study was clearly needed to confirm these results. The outcome of this new study is to assess the qualities of a predictive test on occurrence of the ACS after rAAA surgery. This is a 30 months prospective cohort study conducted in 12 centers and 165 patients will be included. All patients with a rAAA will be consecutively included , whatever the surgical treatment. At the end of surgery , all patients have an abdominal closure and a monitoring of intrabladder pressure will be established every 3 to 4 hours. Decompressive laparotomy will be indicated when ACS occurs. Follow-up period is 1 month. Eight pre- and per-operative criteria will be studied: anemia<symptom> , hypotension<symptom> , cardiac arrest , obesity , massive fluid resuscitation , transfusion , hypothermia<symptom> , and acidosis. In the literature , there is no recommendation about prophylactic decompression , but early decompressive laparotomy appears to improve survival. This study should make it possible to establish a predictive test , detect the ACS early , and consider a prophylactic decompression in the operating room.
