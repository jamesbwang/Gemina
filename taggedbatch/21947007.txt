 Genes controlling plant development have been studied in multiple plant systems. This has provided deep insights into conserved genetic pathways controlling core developmental processes including meristem identity , phase transitions , determinacy , stem elongation , and branching. These pathways control plant growth patterns and are fundamentally important to crop biology and agriculture. This review describes the conserved pathways that control plant development , using Arabidopsis as a model. Historical examples of how plant development has been altered through selection to improve crop performance are then presented. These examples , drawn from diverse crops , show how the genetic pathways controlling development have been modified to increase yield or tailor growth patterns to suit local growing environments or specialized crop management practices. Strategies to apply current progress in genomics and developmental biology to future crop improvement are then discussed within the broader context of emerging trends in plant breeding. The ways that knowledge of developmental processes and understanding of gene function can contribute to crop improvement , beyond what can be achieved by selection alone , are emphasized. These include using genome re-sequencing , mutagenesis , and gene editing to identify or generate novel variation in developmental genes. The expanding scope for comparative genomics , the possibility to engineer new developmental traits and new approaches to resolve gene-gene or gene-environment interactions are also discussed. Finally , opportunities to integrate fundamental research and crop breeding are highlighted.
