 Cardiolipin ( CL) is a unique phospholipid localized almost exclusively within the mitochondrial membranes<symptom> where it is synthesized. Newly synthesized CL undergoes acyl remodeling to produce CL species enriched with unsaturated acyl groups. Cld1 is the only identified CL specific phospholipase in yeast and is required to initiate the CL remodeling pathway. In higher eukaryotes , peroxidation of CL , yielding CL
