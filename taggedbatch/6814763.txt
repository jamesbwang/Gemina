 Combinational anticancer therapy demonstrates increased efficiency , as it targets different cell-survival mechanisms and allows the decrease of drug dosages that are often toxic to normal cells. Inhibitors of the heat shock<symptom> response ( HSR) are known to reduce the efficiency of proteostasis mechanisms in many cancerous cells , and therefore , may be employed as anti-tumor drug complements. However , the application of HSR inhibitors is limited by their cytotoxicity , and we suggested that milder inhibitors may be employed to sensitize cancer cells to a certain drug. We used a heat-shock element-luciferase reporter system and discovered a compound , CL-43 , that inhibited the levels of heat shock<symptom> proteins 40 , 70 ( Hsp70) , and 90 kDa in HCT-116 cells and was not toxic for cells of several lines , including normal human fibroblasts. Consequently , CL-43 was found to reduce colony formation and motility of HCT-116 in the appropriate assays suggesting its possible application in the exploration of biology of metastasizing tumors. Importantly , CL-43 elevated the growth-inhibitory and cytotoxic activity of etoposide , cisplatin , and doxorubicin suggesting that the pro-drug has broad prospect for application in a variety of anti-tumor therapy schedules.
