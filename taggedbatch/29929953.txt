 Son-biased sex ratios at birth ( M: F) , an extreme manifestation of son preference , are predominately found in East and South Asia. Studies have examined sex ratios among first-generation migrants from these regions , but few have examined second-generation descendants. Our objective was to determine whether son-biased sex ratios persist among second-generation mothers with South Asian ethnicity in Ontario , Canada. A surname algorithm identified a population-based cohort of mothers with South Asian ethnicity who gave birth in Ontario between 1993 and 2014 ( n = 59659). Linking to official immigration data identified births to first-generation mothers ( ie , immigrants). Births not to immigrants were designated as being to second-generation mothers ( ie , born in Canada) ( n = 10273). Sex ratios and 95 % CI were stratified by the sex of previous live births and by whether it was preceded by â‰¥ 1 abortion<disease><symptom> for both first-generation and second-generation mothers. Among mothers with two previous daughters and at least one prior abortion<disease><symptom> since the second birth , both second-generation mothers and first-generation mothers had elevated sex ratios at the third birth ( 2.80 ( 95 % CI 1.36 to 5.76) and 2.46 ( 95 % CI 1.93 to 3.12) , respectively). However , among mothers with no prior abortion<disease><symptom> , second-generation mothers had a normal sex ratio , while first-generation mothers gave birth to 142 boys for every 100 girls ( 95 % CI 125 to 162 boys for every 100 girls). Son preference persists among second-generation mothers of South Asian ethnicity. Culturally sensitive and community-driven gender equity interventions are needed.
