 Alterations in glutamate , the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain , are implicated in several psychiatric diseases. Many of these psychiatric diseases display epidemiological sex differences , with either males or females exhibiting different symptoms or disease prevalence. However , little work has considered the interaction of disrupted glutamatergic transmission and sex on disease states. This review describes the clinical and preclinical evidence for these sex differences with a focus on two conditions that are more prevalent in women: Alzheimer 's disease and major depressive disorder , and three conditions that are more prevalent in men: schizophrenia , autism spectrum disorder , and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. These studies reveal sex differences at multiple levels in the glutamate system including metabolic markers , receptor levels , genetic interactions , and therapeutic responses to glutamatergic drugs. Our survey of the current literature revealed a considerable need for more evaluations of sex differences in future studies examining the role of the glutamate system in psychiatric disease. Gaining a more thorough understanding of how sex differences in the glutamate system contribute to psychiatric disease could provide novel avenues for the development of sex-specific pharmacotherapies.
