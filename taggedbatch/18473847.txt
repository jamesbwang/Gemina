 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> and major cause of chronic liver disease in developed countries. Its prevalence is increasing in parallel with the prevalence of obesity and other components of the metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom>. As the liver is central to the clearance and catabolism of circulating advanced glycosylation end-products ( AGEs) , AGEs and their cognate receptors-RAGE ( receptor for AGEs) system might be involved in NAFLD in obese patients. To examine this , we investigated four common polymorphisms of RAGE gene: 1704G/T ( rs184003) , G82S ( rs2070600) , -374 T/A ( rs1800624) and -429 T/C ( rs1800625) in 340 obese patients with metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom>. and protein levels of AGE and RAGE. This is the first study to describe association of 4 common polymorphisms with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH) as well as to examine protein levels of RAGE and AGE. Univariate analysis showed patients carrying the rs1800624 heterozygote genotype ( AT) exhibited 2.36-fold increased risk of NASH ( odds ratio ( OR) = 2.36; 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI): 1.35-4.19) after adjusting for confounders. The minor allele -374 A has been shown to suppress the expression of RAGE protein. The protein levels of esRAGE , total sRAGE and AGE protein levels did not correlate with each other in obese patients with no liver disease , indicative of RAGE signaling playing an independent role in liver injury. In obese patients with non-NASH NAFLD and NASH respectively , esRAGE protein showed strong positive correlation with total sRAGE protein. Further , haplotype analysis of the 4 SNPs , indicated that haplotype G-A-T-G was significantly associated with 2-fold increased risk for NASH ( OR = 2.08; 95 % CI: 1.21-3.5; P = 0.006) after adjusting for confounders. In conclusion , the presented data indicate that the G-A-T-G haplotype containing minor allele at position -374 A and major allele at position -429 T , 1704G , and G82S G could be regarded as a marker for NASH.
