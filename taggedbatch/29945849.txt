 To analyze the impact of the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium ( INICC) Multidimensional Approach ( IMA) and use of INICC Surveillance Online System ( ISOS) on ventilator-associated<disease> pneumonia<disease> ( VAP) rates in Saudi Arabia from September 2013 to February 2017. A multicenter , prospective , before-after surveillance study on 14,961 patients in 37 intensive care units ( ICUs) of 22 hospitals. During baseline , we performed outcome surveillance of VAP applying the definitions of the CDC/NHSN. During intervention , we implemented the IMA and the ISOS , which included: ( 1) a bundle of infection prevention practice interventions , ( 2) education , ( 3) outcome surveillance , ( 4) process surveillance , ( 5) feedback on VAP rates and consequences and ( 6) performance feedback of process surveillance. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed using generalized linear mixed models to estimate the effect of intervention. The baseline rate of 7.84 VAPs per 1000 mechanical-ventilator ( MV)- days-with 20,927 MV-days and 164 VAPs- , was reduced to 4.74 VAPs per 1000 MV-days-with 118,929 MV-days and 771 VAPs- , accounting for a 39 % rate reduction ( IDR 0.61; 95 % CI 0.5-0.7; P 0.001). Implementing the IMA was associated with significant reductions in VAP rates in ICUs of Saudi Arabia.
