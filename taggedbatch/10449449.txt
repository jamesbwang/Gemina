 Denmark has not had cases of bovine tuberculosis<disease> ( bovTB) for more than 30 years but is obliged by trade agreements to undertake traditional meat inspection ( TMI) of finisher pigs from non-controlled housing to detect bovTB. TMI is associated with higher probability of detecting bovTB but is also more costly than visual-only inspection ( VOI). To identify whether VOI should replace TMI of finisher pigs from non-controlled housing , the cost of error- defined here as probability of overlooking infection and associated economic costs- should be assessed and compared with surveillance costs. First , a scenario tree model was set up to assess the ability of detecting bovTB in an infected herd (
