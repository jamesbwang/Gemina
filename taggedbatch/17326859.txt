 Many prevention of mother-to-child HIV<pathogen> transmission programmes across Africa initiate HIV-infected ( HIV<pathogen> positive) pregnant women on lifelong antiretroviral therapy ( ART) on the first day of antenatal care ( `` same-day '' initiation). However , there are concerns that same-day initiation may limit patient preparation before starting ART and contribute to subsequent non-adherence , disengagement from care and raised viral load. We examined if same-day initiation was associated with viral suppression and engagement in care during pregnancy. Consecutive ART-eligible pregnant women making their first antenatal care ( ANC) visit at a primary care facility in Cape Town , South Africa were enrolled into a prospective cohort between March 2013 and June 2014. Before July 2013 , ART eligibility was based on CD4 cell count ≤ 350 cells/μL ( `` Option A '') , with a 1 to 2 week delay from the first ANC visit to ART initiation for patient preparation; thereafter all women were eligible regardless of CD4 cell count ( `` Option B + '') and offered ART on the same day as first ANC visit. Women were followed with viral load testing conducted separately from routine ART services , and engagement in ART services was measured using routinely collected clinic , pharmacy and laboratory records through 12 months postpartum. Among 628 HIV-positive women ( median age , 28 years; median gestation at ART start , 21 weeks; 55 % newly diagnosed with HIV<pathogen>) , 73 % initiated ART same-day; this proportion was higher under Option B + versus Option A ( 85 % vs. 20 %). Levels of viral suppression ( viral load < 50 copies/mL) at delivery ( 74 % vs. 82 %) and 12 months postpartum ( 74 % vs. 71 %) were similar under same-day versus delayed initiation respectively. Findings were consistent when viral suppression was defined at < 1000 copies/mL , after adjustment for demographic/clinical measures and across subgroups of age , CD4 and timing of HIV<pathogen> diagnosis. Time to first viral rebound following initial suppression did not differ by timing of ART initiation nor did engagement in care through 12 months postpartum ( same-day = 73 % , delayed = 73 % , p = 0.910). These data suggest that same-day ART initiation during pregnancy is not associated with lower levels of engagement in care or viral suppression through 12 months post-delivery in this setting , providing reassurance to ART programmes implementing Option B +.
