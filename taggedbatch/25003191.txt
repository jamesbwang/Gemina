 The phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K) pathway shows frequent aberrant alterations and pathological activation in breast cancer cells. While PI3K inhibitors have not achieved expectant therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials , and several studies provide promising combination strategies to substantially maximize therapeutic outcomes. Besides its direct impact on regulating cancer cells survival , PI3K inhibitors are also demonstrated to have an immunomodulatory impact based on the tumor microenvironment. Inhibition of the leukocyte-enriched PI3K isoforms may break immune tolerance and restore cytotoxic T cell activity by reprogramming the tumor microenvironment. In addition , PI3K inhibitors have pleiotropic effects on tumor angiogenesis and even induce tumor vascular normalization. In this review , we discuss the mechanism of PI3K inhibitor suppression of breast cancer cells and modulation of the tumor microenvironment in order to provide further thoughts for breast cancer treatment.
