 Ki-67 parameter is a proliferation marker in malignant tumors. The increased proliferation activity and the decreased prognosis in lung cancer determined us to investigate different parameters connected to the tumor 's aggression , such as cellularity , Ki-67 positivity rate , and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA). We evaluated the proliferative activity in 62 primary lung tumors by determining the cell 's percentage of Ki-67 and immunoreactive PCNA ( using MIB-1 and PCNA monoclonal antibodies) , classifying Ki-67 and PCNA immunoreactivity into three score groups. The results obtained emphasized a linkage between Ki-67 score with the histological tumor subtype , tumor cellularity and degree of differentiation and with other proliferation immunohistochemistry ( IHC) markers , such as p53 cellular tumor antigen. The tumor 's cellularity , the Ki-67 positivity rate and PCNA , together with the clinical stage and the histological differentiation bring extra pieces of useful information in order to anticipate the evolution and the prognosis of lung cancer.
