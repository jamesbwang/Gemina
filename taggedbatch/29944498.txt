 To investigate the ocular surface of an aged population wearing a daily disposable contact lens ( CL) over their 1st day of wear. Forty eyes from 40 presbyopic subjects were fitted a daily CL ( Delefilcon A). Tear osmolarity , tear meniscus area ( TMA) , and ocular surface aberrations ( total higher-order root mean square ( RMS)) were assessed at baseline ( t0) , at 20 min ( t1) and after 8 hr ( t2) of wear. Fluorescein corneal and conjunctival staining and tear breakup time ( TBUT) were performed at t0 and t2. No statistically significant changes were found between t0 , t1 , and t2 for TMA and between t0 and t2 for fluorescein corneal and conjunctival staining. Tear breakup time worsened by the end of the day from 10.4 ± 0.4 sec t0 to 9.0 ± 0.3 sec t2 ( P < 0.05). Osmolarity showed significant changes between t0 306.9 ± 2.3 mOsm/L and t1 312.4 ± 2.4 mOsmol/L ( P = 0.02) but returned to baseline values at 8 hr ( 310.40 ± 2.26 mOsm/L; P = 0.09). Total higher-order RMS showed significant changes between t0 0.38 ± 0.02 μm and t1 0.61 ± 0.04 μm ( P ≤ 0.001) and between t0 and t2 0.64 ± 0.41 μm ( P ≤ 0.001). Delefilcon A may induce measures changes ( osmolarity and TBUT values) in a presbyopic population; however , TMA and vital staining were maintained at the baseline level over the day.
