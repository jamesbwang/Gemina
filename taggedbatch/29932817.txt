 Two new species in Lepiota sect. Ovisporae are described from tropical China. Lepiota angusticystidiata has a pileus with brownish yellow squamules covering a trichodermial palisade , ellipsoidal basidiospores , and narrowly clavate cheilocystidia; L. brunneosquamulosa has a tomentose , squamulose pileus with brownish yellow<symptom> to yellowish brown concentric zones covering a trichodermial palisade , rarely with short elements , ellipsoidal or subcylindrical basidiospores with straight adaxial side , and no cheilocystidia. Phylogenetic relationships among species of sect. Ovisporae were inferred based on DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region ( ITS1-5.8 S-ITS2 = ITS) , the 5 ' end of the 28S gene ( D1-D2-D3 variable domains) , and partial sequences of the intergenic spacer ( IGS1) of the nuc rDNA and the mitochondrial small ribosomal RNA gene ( mtSSU) , supporting the delineation of these new species.
