 Klotho is a single-pass transmembrane protein with documented anti-cancer properties. Recent reports have implicated Klotho as an inhibitor of transforming growth factor Î²1 induced cell migration in renal fibrosis<disease>. Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) is known to promote tumor initiation and progression in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma ( cRCC). We tested our hypothesis that Klotho inhibits EGF-mediated cell migration in cRCC by interfering with the EGFR signaling complex and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) pathways. We performed cell adhesion , migration , and biochemical studies
