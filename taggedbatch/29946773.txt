 Metabolism is the fundamental process for all cellular functions. For decades , there has been growing evidence with regard to the relationship between metabolism and malignant cell proliferation. Unlike normal differentiated cells , however , cancer cells have reprogrammed metabolisms in order to fulfill their energy requirements. These cells display crucial modifications in many metabolic pathways , including glucose transport , glutaminolysis which includes the tricarboxylic acid ( TCA) cycle , the electron transport chain ( ETC) , and the pentose phosphate pathway ( PPP) ( 1). Since the discovery of the Warburg effect , it has been shown that the metabolism of cancer cells plays a critical role in cancer survival and growth. More recent research suggests that the involvement of glutamine in cancer metabolism is more significant than previously thought. Glutamine , a non essential amino acid with an amine functional group , is the most abundant amino acid circulating in the bloodstream ( 2). This chapter will discuss the characteristic features of glutamine metabolism in cancers.
