 Targeted gene delivery relies on the ability to limit the expression of a transgene within a defined cell/tissue population. MicroRNAs represent a class of highly powerful and effective regulators of gene expression that act by binding to a specific sequence present in the corresponding messenger RNA. Involved in almost every aspect of cellular function , many miRNAs have been discovered with expression patterns specific to developmental stage , lineage , cell-type , or disease stage. Exploiting the binding sites of these miRNAs allows for construction of targeted gene delivery platforms with a diverse range of applications. Here , we summarize studies that have utilized miRNA-regulated systems to achieve targeted gene delivery for both research and therapeutic purposes. Additionally , we identify criteria that are important for the effectiveness of a particular miRNA for such applications and we also discuss factors that have to be taken into consideration when designing miRNA-regulated expression cassettes.
