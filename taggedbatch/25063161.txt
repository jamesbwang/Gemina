 Fingerprint biometrics is a valuable and convenient security tool; every fingerprint is highly detailed and unique , we always have them on `` hand ''. Herein we describe a novel bench-top method of making 3D fingerprint replicas ( namely , fingerprint phantoms) by exploring a unique microfabrication approach using conventional polymeric materials , to aid the development of reliable and accurate fingerprint biometrics. By pressing an impression of human fingerprints onto solvent-softened plastic plates ( e.g. , polycarbonate chips) , followed by casting with polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS , a popular elastomer) , we can produce a flexible , nanoscale detailed , 3D reproduction of the fingerprint ( `` phantom ''). By testing with standard optical fingerprint scanners , we have shown that all three levels of fingerprint details can be precisely recorded and match well with the original fingerprint. Superior to artificial fingerprint patterns , these phantoms have the exact 3D features of fingerprints and introduce no variability compared to human sampling , which make them perfect targets for standardizing fingerprint scanners and for biometric applications. We envision that the microcontact replication protocol via unconventional PC molding promises a practical , bench-top , instrumentation-free method to mass reproduce many other micro/nanostructures with high fidelity.
