 Patients with Behcet 's disease ( BD) are recognized with increased risk for venous and/or arterial thrombosis. Thrombotic tendency of BD is not known. Vascular injury , loss and dysfunction/hyperfunction of endothelial cells are believed to play a role in thrombosis development. Injury and inflammation<symptom> due to vasculitis can cause platelet response with increase in mean platelet volume ( MPV) and thrombosis in BD. In this study , we aimed to compare the levels of MPV between patients with BD and healthy controls , and also show its effect on thrombosis. One hundred patients with BD and 100 healthy controls were evaluated for MPV levels with clinical findings in age-gender matched case-control study. The variables of patients and controls were compared and correlated using chi-square , Mann-Whitney U and Spearman tests. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent predictors of vascular involvement and thrombosis. Mean MPV was significantly higher in patients with BD than healthy controls ( MPV; Patients: 9.2 ± 0.9 ( 7.3-12.9) vs. Controls: 8.2 ± 0.6 ( 6.8-10.6) fl; P < 0.0001). Platelets levels were lower than controls , but not significantly ( 236 ± 52.3 ( 112-451) vs. 245 ± 52.8 ( 141-467) x10 MPV is a simple measurement for indirect monitoring of platelet activity and thrombotic potential. MPV and EN may be independent risk factors for vascular thrombosis in BD. Patients with higher MPV levels and EN in BD , might have been pursued closely for enhancing thrombosis. We advise to check the MPV and put the patients on anticoagulation if it is high.
