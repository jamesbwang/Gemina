 To assess the prevalence of thyroid diseases in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) in comparison with normal population; to determine prevalence of T2DM in patients with thyroid diseases. First group consisted of 60 patients with T2DM without previous history of thyroid disease. Second group consisted of 60 patients with thyroid disease without any previously known impairment of glucose metabolism. Control group ( CG) included 100 subjects who had no previous history of thyroid disease or glucose metabolism impairment. Blood tests were performed to evaluate thyroid and glucose metabolism parameters. We found a significantly higher prevalence of thyroid diseases in patients with T2DM when compared to CG. Patients with T2DM showed to have higher serum levels of free triiodothyronine ( fT3) , thyroidâ€‘stimulating hormone ( TSH) and anti-thyroid peroxidase ( anti-TPO) autoantibodies. We found no statistical significance in prevalence of T2DM in patients with thyroid diseases and CG. Among parameters of glucose metabolism , there were only higher fasting glucose levels in patients with hyperthyroidism and autoimmune thyroid disease ( AITD). Patients with T2DM showed to have higher prevalence of AITD and primary hypothyroidism. We did not find higher prevalence of T2DM in patients with thyroid diseases ( Tab. 3 , Ref. 29).
