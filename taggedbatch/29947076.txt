 Neurological prognostication is an essential part of post-resuscitation care in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA). This study aims to assess the use of computed tomography ( CT) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MR) of the head , electroencephalography ( EEG) , and somatosensory evoked potentials ( SSEP) in neurological prognostication in resuscitated OHCA patients and factors associated with their use in Danish tertiary and non-tertiary centers from 2005 to 2013 and associations with outcome. We used the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry to identify patients ≥ 18 years of age admitted to intensive care units due to OHCA of presumed cardiac etiology. CT 0-20 days and MR , SSEP , and EEG ≥ 2-20 days post OHCA were considered related to prognostication. Incidence and factors associated with procedures were assessed by multiple Cox regression with death as competing risk. Use of CT , MR , EEG , and SSEP increased during the study period ( CT: 51 % -67 % , HR Use of neurological prognostication procedures increased during the study period. EEG and SSEP were more used in tertiary centers. CT , EEG and SSEP were associated with increased mortality.
