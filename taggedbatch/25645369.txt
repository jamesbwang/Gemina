 Measurement of lung function can be difficult in young children. Structured light plethysmography ( SLP) is a novel , noncontact method of measuring tidal breathing that monitors displacement of the thoraco-abdominal wall. SLP was used to compare breathing in children recovering from an acute exacerbation of asthma/wheeze and an age-matched cohort of controls. Children aged 2-12 years with acute asthma/wheeze ( n = 39) underwent two 5-min SLP assessments , one before bronchodilator treatment and one after. SLP was performed once in controls ( n = 54). Nonparametric comparisons of patients to healthy children and of pre-bronchodilator to post-bronchodilator were made for all children , and also stratified by age group ( 2-5 vs. 6-12 years old). In the asthma/wheeze group , IE50
