 Motion assessment of the body 's head-arms-trunk ( HAT) using linked-segment models , along with an inverse dynamics approach , can enable in vivo estimations of inter-vertebral moments. However , this mathematical approach is prone to experimental errors because of inaccuracies in ( i) kinematic measurements associated with soft<disease> tissue artifacts and ( ii) estimating individual-specific body segment parameters ( BSPs). The inaccuracy of the BSPs is particularly challenging for the multi-segment HAT due to high inter-participant variability in the HAT 's BSPs and no study currently exists that can provide a less erroneous estimation of the joint moments along the spinal column. This study characterized three-dimensional ( 3D) inter-segmental moments in a multi-segment HAT model during multi-directional trunk-bending , after minimizing the experimental errors. Eleven healthy individuals participated in a multi-directional trunk-bending experiment in five directions with three speeds. A seven-segment HAT model was reconstructed for each participant , and its motion was recorded. After compensating for experimental errors due to soft<disease> tissue artifacts , and using optimized individual-specific BSPs , and center of pressure offsets , the inter-segmental moments were calculated via inverse dynamics. Our results show a significant effect of the inter-segmental level and trunk-bending directions on the obtained moments. Compensating for soft<disease> tissue artifacts contributed significantly to reducing errors. Our results indicate complex , task-specific patterns of the 3D moments , with high inter-participant variability at different inter-segmental levels , which can not be studied using single-segment models or without error compensation. Interpretation of inter-segmental moments after compensation of experimental errors is important for clinical evaluations and developing injury prevention and rehabilitation strategies.
