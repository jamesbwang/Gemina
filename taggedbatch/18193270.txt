 Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. The silent nature of the disease and its poor prognosis , the need for further research , along with the need to assess the outcomes of current approaches necessitate an ongoing evaluation of the epidemiology and mortality-trends of this malignancy. Continuous monitoring of disease-patterns , on population-levels , may help scientists assess the quality of healthcare delivery , boost their understanding of diseases ' characteristics and risk factors , and detect gaps whereby further research is needed. None of the previous reports shed light on pancreatic adenocarcinomas ( PAC) , the most common type of Pancreatic Cancer , as the primary outcome. In this study we aim to investigate PAC 's incidence and mortality trends over the last four decades in the United States. We used SEER 9 database to study PAC cases during 1974-2014. Incidence and mortality rates were calculated by sex , age , race , state and stage of PAC. Annual percent change ( APC) was calculated using joinpoint regression software. We reviewed 67,878 PAC cases; most of these cases were in the head of pancreas. Overall PAC incidence rates increased 1.03 % ( 95 % CI , 0.86-1.21 , p < .001) per year over the study period. Rates of adenocarcinoma of the head of pancreas increased 0.87 % ( 95 % CI , 0.68-1.07 , p < .001) , and rates of adenocarcinoma of the body and tail of pancreas increased 3.42 % ( 95 % CI , 3.06-3.79 , p < .001) per year during 1973-2014. PAC incidence-based mortality increased 2.22 % ( 95 % CI , 1.93-2.51 , p < .001) per year. However , during 2012-2014 there was a statistically significant decrease in PAC incidence-based mortality; APC , -24.70 % ( 95 % CI , -31.78- -16.88 , p < .001). PAC 's incidence and mortality rates have been increasing for decades. However , the last few years have shown a promising decrease in mortality. We believe that further advances in healthcare delivery and research can lead to a further mortality decrease. Future studies can use this paper as a baseline to keep monitoring the outcomes of PAC 's therapy.
