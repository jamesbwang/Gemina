 Methyl parathion hydrolase ( MPH) that hydrolyzes a wide range of organophosphorus pesticides can be used to remediate land polluted by the pesticides. Here , the catalytic efficiency of methyl parathion hydrolase from Pseudomonas<pathogen> sp. ( WBC-3) was enhanced by searching and engineering a critical site far away from the binding pocket. In the first round , a four-site mutant with a modest increased catalytic efficiency ( 3.2-fold k
