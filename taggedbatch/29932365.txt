 OBJECTIVE Functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging ( fcMRI) is a form of fMRI that allows for analysis of blood oxygen level-dependent signal changes within a task-free , resting paradigm. This technique has been shown to have efficacy in evaluating network connectivity changes with epilepsy. Presurgical data from patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy were evaluated using the fcMRI technique to define connectivity changes within and between the diseased and healthy temporal lobes using a within-subjects design. METHODS Using presurgical fcMRI data from pediatric patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy , the authors performed seed-based analyses within the diseased and healthy temporal lobes. Connectivity within and between temporal lobe seeds was measured and compared. RESULTS In the cohort studied , local ipsilateral temporal lobe connectivity was significantly increased on the diseased side compared to the healthy temporal lobe. Connectivity of the diseased side to the healthy side , on the other hand , was significantly reduced when compared to connectivity of the healthy side to the diseased temporal lobe. A statistically significant regression was observed when comparing the changes in local ipsilateral temporal lobe connectivity to the changes in inter-temporal lobe connectivity. A statistically significant difference was also noted in ipsilateral connectivity changes between patients with and those without mesial temporal sclerosis. CONCLUSIONS Using fcMRI , significant changes in ipsilateral temporal lobe and inter-temporal lobe connectivity can be appreciated in unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy. Furthermore , fcMRI may have a role in the presurgical evaluation of patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy.
