 Light-driven control of biological processes using photoswitchable proteins allows high spatiotemporal interrogation or manipulation of such processes , assisting in understanding their functions. Despite considerable advances , however , the wide spread use of optical control has been hampered by a limited repertoire of photoswitchable proteins and a lack of generalized design strategy. Herein , we present a repeat module-based rational design of a photoswitchable protein composed of LRR ( Leucine-rich repeat) modules using azobenzene as a photochromic ligand. Our design approach involves the rational selection of a C
