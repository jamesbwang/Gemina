 This double-blind , first-in-human phase 1 study evaluated pharmacokinetics , safety and tolerability of AL-794 ( prodrug of ALS-033719) , a potent endonuclease inhibitor of influenza<pathogen><disease> A<pathogen> and B in healthy volunteers. Healthy adult volunteers were randomized to AL-794 ( 50-2000 mg single ascending doses , fasting) or placebo ( 5 cohorts , n = 6:2 AL-794: placebo/cohort) in part 1 , and AL-794 ( 50-600 mg multiple ascending doses , twice-daily , fed or fasted) or placebo ( 3 cohorts , n = 8:2 AL-794: placebo/cohort) for 7 days in part 2. In part 3 , 8 healthy volunteers from part 1 received 450 mg AL-794 ( n = 6) or placebo ( n = 2) following a high-fat meal. All dosing were done with an oral suspension. Blood and urine samples for pharmacokinetics were collected at scheduled times and analyzed for ALS-033719 and ALS-033927 ( inactive glucuronide) plasma concentrations using LC-MS/MS. ALS-033719 plasma concentrations increased dose proportionately up to 150 mg but less proportionately above 150 mg. Steady-state was generally achieved by the third dose. ALS-033719 exposure increased following administration with a standard meal ( 19 % -33 %) or high-fat meal ( 3-3.6-fold). ALS-033927 was the major metabolite observed. Renal elimination was negligible ( 0.2 %). Seventeen AL-794-treated healthy volunteers reported â‰¥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse event ( TEAE , part 1: n = 6 , 24 %; part 2: n = 11 , 69 %). The most common TEAEs were headache<symptom> ( part 1: n = 3; part 2: n = 5) and dizziness<symptom> ( part 1: n = 2; part 2: n = 6). AL-794 up to 200 mg twice-daily achieved ALS-033719 exposures which are expected to be efficacious and were generally tolerated. Further studies are planned to characterize safety and antiviral activity.
