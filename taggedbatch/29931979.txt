 This paper reports a fast and highly sensitive all-graphene humidity sensor working in a novel alternating current ( ac) detection mode for the first time , which is capable of sensing humidity on a smartphone for portable electronics. The humidity sensor is based on an interdigitated reduced graphene oxide/graphene oxide/rGO ( rGO/GO/rGO) structure patterned by a facile laser direct writing method. It works in an ac sensing mode with a rectangular input voltage wave and measures the output voltage wave instead of conventional resistance , impedance , or capacitance , exhibiting a dramatically enhanced sensitivity by about 45 times compared to the low and unstable response in dc mode. The humidity sensor shows an obvious response to the relative humidity ( RH) ranging from RH 6.3 % to RH 100 %. The response and recovery toward humidity change are almost instantaneous , and the corresponding costed times including humidity rise and decay times are less than 1.9 and 3.9 s , respectively , which are among the best results in the literature. The sensor also exhibits outstanding cycling stability , flexibility , and long-term stability ( > 1 year) , as well as good reproducibility of device preparation. Besides , it can be easily connected to an iPhone and the humidity sensing can be conducted with an oscilloscope application on iOS. What 's more , an electronic circuit simulation method was employed to fit the output waves , which can not only explain the sensing mechanism , but also determine the resistance and capacitance of the rGO/GO/rGO structure , agreeing well with the results obtained from the electrochemical measurements. It can be reasonably expected that the approach combining humidity sensing and electronic circuit simulation can be applied in real-time monitoring on a smartphone based on the Internet of things and big data technologies.
