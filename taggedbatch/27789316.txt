 Sample size determination for open-ended questions or qualitative interviews relies primarily on custom and finding the point where little new information is obtained ( thematic saturation). Here , we propose and test a refined definition of saturation as obtaining the most salient items in a set of qualitative interviews ( where items can be material things or concepts , depending on the topic of study) rather than attempting to obtain all the items. Salient items have higher prevalence and are more culturally important. To do this , we explore saturation , salience , sample size , and domain size in 28 sets of interviews in which respondents were asked to list all the things they could think of in one of 18 topical domains. The domains-like kinds of fruits ( highly bounded) and things that mothers do ( unbounded)- varied greatly in size. The datasets comprise 20-99 interviews each ( 1,147 total interviews). When saturation was defined as the point where less than one new item per person would be expected , the median sample size for reaching saturation was 75 ( range = 15-194). Thematic saturation was , as expected , related to domain size. It was also related to the amount of information contributed by each respondent but , unexpectedly , was reached more quickly when respondents contributed less information. In contrast , a greater amount of information per person increased the retrieval of salient items. Even small samples ( n = 10) produced 95 % of the most salient ideas with exhaustive listing , but only 53 % of those items were captured with limited responses per person ( three). For most domains , item salience appeared to be a more useful concept for thinking about sample size adequacy than finding the point of thematic saturation. Thus , we advance the concept of saturation in salience and emphasize probing to increase the amount of information collected per respondent to increase sample efficiency.
