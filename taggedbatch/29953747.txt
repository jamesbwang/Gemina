 The mechanism of upper tract recurrence after local excision of bladder cancer remains unknown. This study was designed to identify risk factors for upper tract urothelial recurrence following local tumor excision of bladder cancer. To identify 76 597 bladder cancer patients , comprising 76 537 nonrecurrence and 60 recurrence patients , the Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results database was used. Kaplan-Meier analysis and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine the risk factors. Compared with the nonrecurrence group , the recurrence group was associated with older age , higher grade , high T stage , and higher proportional squamous cell carcinomas. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that age , grades III and IV , T stage , and pathology were significantly associated with worse upper tract urothelial recurrence ( UTUR) survival. However , after adjusting for prognostic factors , grade was no longer an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. This study demonstrates that clinical prognosis of UTUR after local bladder tumor excision has significant independent risk factors that include age â‰¥ 60 years , T1 and T2 stage , and squamous cell carcinoma , and will require more careful consideration during follow-up.
