 Cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICIs) has become a `` game changer '' in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). Its most clinically important advantage over traditional chemotherapy using cytotoxic agents are its long-term survival benefits , and some advanced NSCLC patients treated with an antibody against programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1) have survived for 5 years or longer. Immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICIs) are also potentially useful for earlier-stage NSCLC when used in combination with surgery or radiotherapy. A recent clinical trial has shown that consolidation treatment with an antibody against a ligand of PD-1 ( PD-L1) following chemo-radiotherapy significantly improves progression-free survival for patients with locally advanced NSCLC. However , current single-agent treatment with an anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 antibody may provide significant survival benefits only in a small subset of patients. PD-L1 expression status on tumor cells is an approved biomarker to predict response to ICIs , but is not enough for optimal patient selection. To improve the therapeutic outcomes , development of novel biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status is essential. Combination treatment strategies based on blockade of PD-1/ PD-L1 may also be promising , and a variety of combinations , such as ICIs plus chemotherapy , are being examined in ongoing clinical trials. Here we review and discuss the current status and future perspectives of immunotherapy with ICIs.
