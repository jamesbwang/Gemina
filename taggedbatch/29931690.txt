 The suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN) is the neural network that drives daily rhythms in behavior and physiology. The SCN encodes environmental changes through the phasing of cellular rhythms across its anteroposterior axis , but it remains unknown what signaling mechanisms regulate clock function along this axis. Here we demonstrate that arginine vasopressin ( AVP) signaling organizes the SCN into distinct anteroposterior domains. Spatial mapping of SCN gene expression using in situ hybridization delineated anterior and posterior domains for AVP signaling components , including complementary patterns of V1a and V1b expression that suggest different roles for these two AVP receptors. Similarly , anteroposterior patterning of transcripts involved in Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide- and Prokineticin2 signaling was evident across the SCN. Using bioluminescence imaging , we then revealed that inhibiting V1A and V1B signaling alters period and phase differentially along the anteroposterior SCN. V1 antagonism lengthened period the most in the anterior SCN , whereas changes in phase were largest in the posterior SCN. Further , separately antagonizing V1A and V1B signaling modulated SCN function in a manner that mapped onto anteroposterior expression patterns. Lastly , V1 antagonism influenced SCN period and phase along the dorsoventral axis , complementing effects on the anteroposterior axis. Together , these results indicate that AVP signaling modulates SCN period and phase in a spatially specific manner , which is expected to influence how the master clock interacts with downstream tissues and responds to environmental changes. More generally , we reveal anteroposterior asymmetry in neuropeptide signaling as a recurrent organizational motif that likely influences neural computations in the SCN clock network.
