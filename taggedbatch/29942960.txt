 The direct synthesis of copper selenide nanoparticles from the reaction of ditertiarybutyl selenide tBu2Se with copper ( ii) trifluoroacetate Cu ( TFA) 2 under mild conditions is reported. The isolation of a molecular species during the course of this reaction , established as ( Cu2 ( TFA) 2 ( tBu2Se) 3) , by spectroscopic studies and single crystal X-ray structure analysis , confirmed that metal selenide NPs are formed via this intermediate species containing a reduced copper center. Extending this reaction in the presence of commercial TiO2 ( P25) offered an easy synthesis of copper selenide-titania nanocomposites with different Cu/Ti ratios. These nanocomposites , well-characterized by powder XRD , STEM , TEM , BET , XPS , EDX and UV-Vis studies , were examined as photocatalysts for the degradation of formic acid ( FA). The nCu2-xSe-TiO2 nanocomposites with low mol % of copper selenide , i.e. n = 0.1 and 0.3 mol % , displayed a superior catalytic activity over P25 , which is an established benchmark for photocatalysis under UV light.
