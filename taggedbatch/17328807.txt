 South Africa has experienced a substantial increase in access to antiretroviral treatment ( ART) in recent years. Effective strategies to manage access to treatment need to be incorporated into and implemented in ART programmes. Antiretroviral treatment adherence clubs are a new strategy that is being implemented in various parts of South Africa. The aim of the study was to investigate treatment adherence and patient satisfaction of stable human<pathogen><disease> immunodeficiency<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) patients on ART in ART adherence clubs and clinics. The study was conducted in the Eden district of the Western Cape , South Africa. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted to examine the relationships between patient satisfaction and treatment adherence in ART adherence clubs and clinics in the Eden district , Western Cape province , South Africa. Validated questionnaires were used to measure patient satisfaction and self-reported treatment adherence. The study included 320 participants ( 98 club and 222 clinic) from 13 primary health care clinics. The analyses showed that higher levels of satisfaction could be predicted with club participants compared to clinic participants ( p = 0.05). There was no significant difference between clinic and club participants with regards to treatment adherence. However , being adherent was more likely in participants who were satisfied ( odds ratio = 3.18 , 95 % confidence interval ( 1.14-7.11) , p < 0.01). Antiretroviral treatment adherence clubs provide a service that patients are more satisfied with although they are not more adherent to treatment. This strategy may be effective for the delivery of long-term care for patients on ART.
