 Methane emissions from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain were estimated by using ground-based , facility-scale measurements and validated with aircraft observations in areas accounting for ~ 30 % of U.S. gas production. When scaled up nationally , our facility-based estimate of 2015 supply chain emissions is 13 Â± 2 teragrams per year , equivalent to 2.3 % of gross U.S. gas production. This value is ~ 60 % higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inventory estimate , likely because existing inventory methods miss emissions released during abnormal operating conditions. Methane emissions of this magnitude , per unit of natural gas consumed , produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time horizon comparable to the CO
