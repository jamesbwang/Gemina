 Optimizing supports for microorganisms is required for bioreactors. Carbon fibres ( CF) were employed as supports for microorganisms. To optimize CF supports for immobilizing bacterial cells , we used methods of nitric acid oxidation and calcium ion coverage. We evaluated the capacity of these CF supports ( untreated CF , nitric acid oxidation CF and Ca
