 Despite the pain ostracism ( being excluded and ignored) causes , researchers have minimally investigated factors related to reducing its occurrence. We investigated the association between higher trait mindfulness ( the tendency to be attentive to the present moment) and lower engagement in ostracism. In Study 1 , employed adults scoring higher on trait mindfulness reported ostracizing coworkers less. In Study 2 , participants possessing higher levels of trait mindfulness demonstrated greater inclusion of a fellow group member being ostracized by others in the group. Results suggested that attention , rather than empathy , was the psychological process responsible for greater inclusion of an ostracized group member by mindful individuals. Study 3 supported this conclusion because participants responded similarly to those high in trait mindfulness when they were instructed to pay attention and ensure all players were included equally. Overall , we found that people with higher levels of trait mindfulness are more attentive to targets of ostracism.
