 The issue of violence in secure services has long been recognized both in the UK and worldwide. However , there is currently scarce literature available about violence within learning disability ( LD) secure settings. Secondary data analysis was conducted on violent incidents , using information routinely collected by the staff over a 1-year period. Physical assaults were the most frequent type of incident , and the distribution in terms of days or months was homogenous and incidents were concentrated in the corridors , lounges and dining rooms of secure facilities. Antipsychotic medication was not regularly prescribed. Generalized linear modelling analyses revealed significant predictors that increased the chances of seclusion and physical restraint , such as being female or directing the violence towards staff. These findings can inform staff training on violence prevention and suggest that increased ward-based supervision and enhanced use of psychological formulations may help in reducing violence within this service context.
