 Rubidium and lithium are rather rare elements in environmental research , despite their affiliation with a group of chemically active metals and the abundance of Rb in the environment. A growing body of evidence , although controversial , has indicated that both elements possess unique essential and neurophysiological characteristics in biota and humans. Both elements may concentrate in soil and vegetation of sub-arid environments. We investigated the content and ( potential) availability of Rb and Li in the soils and natural waters of Galilee , the Coastal Plain , and the northern Negev of Israel. A newly developed chromatographic technique for the separation of truly dissolved Rb and Li compounds has been applied. High concentrations of Rb , together with high values of the potentially vital Rb-to-K ratio , were found in the soils , the soil solutions , rainwater , throughfall water , and the plant litter leachates , but not in the surface and spring waters. This may indicate a sequestration of Rb in the local soils and a semi-closed Rb turnover in the soil-plant system with a major input from sea aerosols. Low<symptom> Li bulk and available concentrations were determined in all the natural compartments. Possible implications of such specific environmental features on the local population health were discussed.
