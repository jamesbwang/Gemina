 Menopausal women appear lipid metabolism disorder with the ovarian function decline and the estrogen levels decreased. Modern clinical usually use estrogen replacement therapy and with long time application with lots of side effect appear. Traditional Chinese medicine has more secure and effective methords , using warming Yang drugs and methods. And the previous study proves the Chinese medicine Astragali Complanati Semen water extraction has a good role in regulation of blood lipids. Because of the liver is the most important organ on regulating metabolism , therefore this study aimed to evaluate the effects of total flavonoids in Astragali Complanati Semen ( TFS) on liverlipid level and ERα expressionon liver in hyperlipidemia rats with kidney-Yang deficiency pattern to explore the substance basis and mechanism of Astragali Complanati Semen in regulate lipid effect and clarify traditional Chinese medicine advantages and features. This experiment uses hyperlipidemia rats with kidney-Yang deficiency pattern with bilateral ovariectomized and fed with high fat diet for 6 weeks. And rats of sham operation group and model group rats were intragastrilly ( ig) with saline , estrogen group were intragastrilly with estrogen ( 0.2 mg · kg ⁻¹). And three TFS group were intragastrilly with TFS at dose 28.5 , 57 , 114 mg · kg ⁻¹ for 8 weeks. At the same time , TC , TG , LDL-C , HDL-C liver weight , liver index , uterine weight , uterine index , serum estrogen level , FSH levels and liver pathology , liver estrogen receptor expression were detected , weighting and calculating their organ index. The experimental results compared with the model group , TFS 114 mg · kg ⁻¹ decreased the level of liver TG (
