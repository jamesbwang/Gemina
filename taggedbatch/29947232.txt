 The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between red blood cell distribution width ( RDW) and mean platelet volume ( MPV) with development of postoperative atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( PoAF) after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG). The RDW and MPV have been associated with some cardiovascular disorders. A total of 93 patients who underwent off-pump CABG were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups as developing and nondeveloping PoAF groups in the postoperative period. We measured whether RDW and MPV levels are a predictive value for development PoAF. There were 24 patients with PoAF enrolled ( mean age: 66 ± 7.8 years) and 69 patients without PoAF ( mean age: 56.26 ± 11.53 years). The PoAF was significantly correlated with age ( p = 0.004) , hematocrit ( p: 0.010) , RDW ( p = 0.007) and creatinine ( p = 0.006). Only advanced age ( p = 0.012) was identified as an independent predictor of PoAF. For predicting PoAF , there was 79.2 % sensitivity and 65.2 % specificity for RDW ( p = 0.001) and 62.5 % sensitivity and 55.1 % specificity for MPV ( p = 0.062). We found that RDW levels and MPV were not an independent predictor of the development of PoAF. However , elevated RDW levels and MPV may be one of the predictive values for PoAF development ( Tab. 3 , Fig. 2 , Ref. 27).
