 Success in soccer is much dependent on how players and teams create and restrict space and time. In match situations , players constitute small sub-groups to improve their collective synchronization and achievement of specific goals. This study aimed to identify changes in the effective playing space ( EPS , defined as the smallest polygonal area delimited by the peripheral outfield players) when considering sub-groups of 3 to 10 players. Twenty outfield professional players participated in this study. The EPS , its regularity pattern ( measured by the approximate entropy) , coefficient of variation and players ' mean speed were calculated for sub-groups of 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 and 10 players , considering the smallest inter-player distance as the criterion. The EPS presented a most likely increase with a higher number of players , especially considering the transition from 3 to 4 players ( ~ 440 % of variation , very large). As the EPS increased with the number of players , the correspondent regularity presented a trend of a most likely increase ( from EPS3 vs. EPS4: ~ 25 % , very large; to EPS9 vs. EPS10: ~ 11 % , moderate). The mean speed results suggest that players may achieve different states of collective coordination , mainly between ~ 6 to 8 km.h-1. Overall , three different match scenarios should require additional attention when aiming to design more match transferable tasks: i) transition from EPS3 to EPS4; ii) transition from EPS4 up to EPS8; and iii) transition from EPS8 to EPS9. These results help to understand match self-organized behaviours and , consequently , allow to optimize task characteristics in practice sessions.
