 Depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> can cause the development of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. However , the mechanism of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> induced by emotional dysfunction is still unknown. Previously , we demonstrated that the G protein-coupled receptor 40/free fatty acid receptor 1 ( GPR40/FFAR1) signaling in the brain is related to regulation of both pain and emotion. In the present study , we proved that the role of GPR40/FFAR1 signaling in the development of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> is induced by emotional dysfunction. Repeated social defeat ( SD)- stressed mice showed the impairment of social interaction and anxiety<symptom> behavior. These mice also caused pain prolongation after paw-incision comparison with non-SD mice. This pain prolongation was markedly continued by infusion of the GPR40/FFAR1 antagonist , GW1100 during SD stress but not non-SD stress. Although , infusion of the GW1100 during SD stress did not cause deterioration of the emotional behavior. Furthermore , GW1100-treated SD-mice showed strong tendency of emotional dysfunction after paw incision. Our findings indicate that the dysfunction of fatty acids-GPR40/ FFAR1 signaling in the brain underlying stress condition might be related to the development of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>.
