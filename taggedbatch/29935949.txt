 Matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP) -8 is the most potent MMP for degrading collagen type-1 and plays an important role in inflammatory reactions and tissue remolding processes. MMP-8 is expressed mainly by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and is not expressed constitutively by most non-leukocytes. We studied the constitutive and TNF-α-induced expression of MMP-8 in cultured human uveal melanocytes ( UM) and the relevant signal pathways involved. Conditioned media and cells were collected from UM and other cell types. MMP-8 proteins and mRNA were measured using ELISA kit , western blot and real time RT-PCR , respectively. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK , ERK1/2 , and JNK1/2 were measured by ELISA kit and western blot. Very high levels of MMP-8 proteins and mRNA were detected in the conditioned media and cell lysates in 11 UM cell lines and three uveal melanoma cell lines cultured without serum , but not in media and cell lysates from other ocular resident cells or 12 malignant cell lines from other tissues , with exception of cutaneous melanoma cells. TNF-α moderately increased MMP-8 mRNA and protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner , accompanied by a significant increase of phosphorylated JNK1/2 and ERK1/2 in cell lysates. ERK1/2 ( U0126) and JNK1/2 ( SP600125) inhibitors significantly blocked TNF-α-induced and constitutive expression of MMP-8 in UM. This is the first report on the expression and secretion of MMP-8 by UM and uveal melanoma cells. The data suggest that UM may play a role in the remolding process and pathogenesis of inflammatory-related diseases in the eye via secretion of MMP-8.
