 Peripheral neuropathy is a common symptom throughout the population , with numerous possible etiologies. The diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies ( and their causes) is mainly based on clinical , electrophysiological , biological , and imaging features. Areas covered: This paper reviews the main causes of neuropathy and discusses the usefulness of nerve biopsy ( NB) in such cases. Expert commentary: In most cases , NB is not mandatory in the diagnostic work-up of a peripheral neuropathy. However , NB is clearly an indication in cases of vasculitis. It is also valuable in peripheral neuropathies with severe and rapid worsening ( without clear cause) in order to uncover a pathological hallmark ( amyloid deposits). Although NB is considered an invasive method , it may be useful in the management of peripheral neuropathy , especially to guide treatment in certain cases. In summary , although NB is not a systematic procedure , it is a useful tool that should be discussed on a case-by-case basis within the clinical context.
