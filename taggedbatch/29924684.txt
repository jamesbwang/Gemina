 Psoriasis is a chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> that affects around 100 million people worldwide. The burden of disease is high , but more recent therapies show promising results. Clinicians need , however , more training in the use of such therapies. Project ECHO One hundred thirty-two dermatologists in Argentina were invited to participate in the WhatsApp discussion group. After 1 year of participation , a follow-up questionnaire was used to assess the effectiveness of the project. Eighty dermatologists participated. All questions placed in the discussion were answered by a psoriasis specialist , 79 % of which were answered within the first 5 min. Clinicians report significant improvement in diagnosis , comorbidities , and treatment with both conventional and biological therapies. Preliminary results are promising. This new cost-effective solution builds on the existing Project ECHO Psoriasis in Argentina and shows potential in bridging the gap of knowledge , promoting better clinical decisions through empowerment of medical doctors operating in remote locations. Further research is needed to increase generalization of the results. Moreover , it would be interesting to match the data from the discussion group with follow-up questionnaires.
