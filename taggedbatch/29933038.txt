 The relationships between affective and cognitive processes are an important issue of present neuroscience. The amygdala , the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex appear as main players in these mechanisms. We have shown that post-training electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala ( BLA) speeds the acquisition of a motor skill , and produces a recovery in behavioral performance related to spatial memory in fimbria-fornix ( FF) lesioned animals. BLA electrical stimulation rises bdnf RNA expression , BDNF protein levels , and arc RNA expression in the hippocampus. In the present paper we have measured the levels of one presynaptic protein ( GAP-43) and one postsynaptic protein ( MAP-2) both involved in synaptogenesis to assess whether structural neuroplastic mechanisms are involved in the memory enhancing effects of BLA stimulation. A single train of BLA stimulation produced in healthy animals an increase in the levels of GAP-43 and MAP-2 that lasted days in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. In FF-lesioned rats , daily post-training stimulation of the BLA ameliorates the memory deficit of the animals and induces an increase in the level of both proteins. These results support the hypothesis that the effects of amygdala stimulation on memory recovery are sustained by an enhanced formation of new synapses.
