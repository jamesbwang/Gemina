 Brachytherapy is integral to vaginal cancer treatment and is typically delivered using an intracavitary single-channel vaginal cylinder ( SCVC) or an interstitial brachytherapy ( ISBT) applicator. Multi-channel vaginal cylinder ( MCVC) applicators allow for improved organ-at-risk ( OAR) sparing compared to SCVC while maintaining target coverage. We present clinical outcomes of patients treated with image-based high dose-rate ( HDR) brachytherapy using a MCVC. Sixty patients with vaginal cancer ( 27 % primary vaginal and 73 % recurrence from other primaries) were treated with combination external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT) and image-based HDR brachytherapy utilizing a MCVC if residual disease thickness was 7 mm or less after EBRT. All pts received 3D image-based BT to a total equivalent dose of 70-80 Gy. The median high-risk clinical target volume was 24.4 cm Clinical outcomes of pts with primary and recurrent vaginal cancer treated definitively in a systematic manner with combination EBRT with image-guided HDR BT utilizing a MCVC applicator demonstrate high rates of local control and low rates of severe morbidity. The MCVC technique allows interstitial implantation to be avoided in select pts with â‰¤ 7 mm residual disease thickness following EBRT while maintaining excellent clinical outcomes with extended 4-year follow-up in this rare malignancy.
