 Integral membrane proteins ( IMPs) are popular target for drugs , but their resolved structures have been overlooked when compared with cytosolic proteins. The main reason is that IMPs usually need intensive post-translational modifications and they are bound to membranes<symptom> , which increase the complexity of purifying or crystalizing them. Although different expression systems are used to express IMPs , baculovirus is considered one of the most successful expression systems for those proteins. Despite that , there are always unknown discrepancies in the level of IMPs expression in the baculovirus expression system. Retrospective studies have shown that expression of an immunoglobulin ( anti-Chymase mouse monoclonal IgG1) driven by vp39 promoter was more efficient compared to its expression under polyhedrin ( polh) promoter; however , this conclusion was not tested on different IMPs to generalize such a conclusion. In this study , the expression of eight different IMPs has been compared under vp39 and polh promoters of Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus. Although different IMPs have shown different patterns of expression , the expression driven by vp39 promoter was found to be generally more efficient than the polh promoter.
