 Branched-chain keto acid decarboxylases ( KDCs) are a class of enzymes that catalyze the decarboxylation of α-keto acids. They are key enzymes for production of higher alcohols in vivo and in vitro. However , the two most active KDCs ( KivD and KdcA) have only moderate thermostability ( < 55 °C) , which hinders the production of alcohols at high temperatures. Herein , structure-guided engineering toward improved thermostability of KdcA is outlined. Strategies such as stabilization of the catalytic center , surface engineering , and optimization of dimer interactions were applied. With seven amino acid substitutions , variant 7M. D showed an increase of the temperature at which 50 % of activity remains after one-hour incubation T1h50 by 14.8 °C without compromising its substrate specificity. 7M. D exhibited greater than 400-fold improvement of half-life at 70 °C and greater than 600-fold increase in process stability in the presence of 4 % isobutanol at 50 °C. 7M. D is more promising for the production of higher alcohols in thermophiles ( > 65 °C) and in cell-free applications.
