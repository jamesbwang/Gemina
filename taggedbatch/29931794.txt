 Steroids can be difficult to modify through traditional organic synthesis methods , but many enzymes regio- and stereoselectively process a wide variety of steroid substrates. We tested whether steroid-modifying enzymes could make novel steroids from non-native substrates. Numerous genes encoding steroid-modifying enzymes , including some bacterial enzymes , were expressed in mammalian cells by transient transfection and found to be active. We made three unusual steroids by stable expression , in HEK293 cells , of the 7α-hydroxylase CYP7B1 , which was selected because of its high native product yield. These cells made 7α,17α-dihydroxypregnenolone and 7β,17α-dihydroxypregnenolone from 17α-hydroxypregnenolone and produced 11α,16α-dihydroxyprogesterone from 16α-hydroxyprogesterone. The last two products were the result of CYP7B1-catalyzed hydroxylation at previously unobserved sites. A Rosetta docking model of CYP7B1 suggested that these substrates ' D-ring hydroxy groups might prevent them from binding in the same way as the native substrates , bringing different carbon atoms close to the active ferryl oxygen atom. This new approach could potentially use other enzymes and substrates to produce many novel steroids for drug candidate testing.
