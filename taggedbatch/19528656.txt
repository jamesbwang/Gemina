 Removing individuals from a wild population can affect the availability of prospective mates and the outcome of competitive interactions , with subsequent effects on mating patterns and sexual selection. Consequently , the rate of harvest-induced evolution is predicted to be strongly dependent on the strength and dynamics of sexual selection , yet there is limited empirical knowledge on the interplay between selective harvesting and the mating systems of exploited species. In this study , we used genetic parentage assignment to compare mating patterns of the highly valued and overexploited European lobster (
