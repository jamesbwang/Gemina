 Two mononuclear pseudotetrahedral cobalt ( ii) complexes with the formula Co ( PNP) X2 , where X = Cl ( 1) or X = SCN ( 2) and PNP = bis ( 2- ( diphenylphosphaneyl) -4-methylphenyl) amine , have been synthesised. Magnetic and high-frequency/field electron paramagnetic resonance ( HF-EPR) spectroscopy and ab initio calculation studies reveal that both complexes show uniaxial magnetic anisotropy.
