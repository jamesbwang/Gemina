 What is the role of insulin-like growth factor 2 ( IGF2)- derived miR-483-3p in macrosomia? IGF2-derived intronic miR-483-3p is overexpressed in macrosomia placentas , and miR-483-3p prompts HTR-8/ SVneo extravillous trophoblast cell line proliferation through down-regulation of its target RB1 inducible coiled-coil 1 ( RB1CC1). Macrosomia is a common pregnancy-associated disease and causes a number of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. The development of macrosomia is reportedly attributable to over proliferation of the placental cells. MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) play an important role in the development of fetal and placenta by regulating their target genes. Here , we investigated the role of IGF2-derived intronic miR-483-3p in macrosomia. The expression of IGF2 , miR-483-3p and its target gene in placental tissues from 30 pregnant women who had macrosomia was compared to those of 30 gestation-matched healthy pregnant controls. For in vitro studies , the human first trimester extravillous trophoblast cell line , HTR-8/ SVneo cell was used. Placenta tissues were collected from pregnant women who had macrosomia without diabetes or other complications ( n = 30) and healthy pregnant controls ( n = 30). HTR-8/ SVneo cells were transfected with specific miRNA mimics or inhibitors. MiRNA and mRNA isolated from placenta tissues or cells were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Protein was measured by western blot. Cell proliferation was assayed using a colorimetric proliferation assay method. Cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. The putative targets of miR-483-3p were predicted using the TargetScan , miRanda , miRDB and DIANA algorithms. Dual luciferase reporter assay was used to measure the relationship of miR-483-3p and RB1CC1. IGF2-derived miR-483-3p was overexpressed in macrosomia placentas. miR-483-3p promoted proliferation in HTR-8/ SVneo cells and had a positive relationship with its host gene IGF2. Subsequently , RB1CC1 was confirmed as a direct target of miR-483-3p , which may be an important mediator of cell growth regulation for miR-483-3p. n/a. The level of IGF2 and its intronic miR-483-3p in the serum of these participants was not investigated. Further studies are required to understand the mechanisms underlying the cause of the increase of IGF2 and miR-483-3p in macrosomia. These findings give a new insight into the role of intronic miRNA and its host gene in the development of macrosomia. Furthermore , it may offer a new target for prognostic and therapeutic intervention for macrosomia.
