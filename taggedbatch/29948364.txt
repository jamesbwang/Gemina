 The vast majority of Dermaptera are free-living and oviparous , i.e. , females lay eggs within which embryonic development occurs until the larva hatches. In contrast , in the epizoic dermapteran Arixenia esau , eggs are retained within mother 's body and the embryos and first instar larvae develop inside her reproductive system. Such a reproductive strategy poses many physiological challenges for a mother , one of which is the removal of metabolic waste generated by the developing offspring. Here , we examine how the Arixenia females cope with this challenge by analyzing features of the developing larval excretory system. Our comparative analyses of the early and late first instar larvae revealed characteristic modifications in the cellular architecture of the Malpighian tubules , indicating that these organs are functional. The results of the electron probe microanalyses suggest additionally that the larval Malpighian tubules are mainly involved in maintaining ion homeostasis. We also found that the lumen of the larval alimentary track is occluded by a cellular diaphragm at the midgut-hindgut junction and that cells of the diaphragm accumulate metabolic compounds. Such an organization of the larval gut apparently prevents fouling of the mother 's organism with the offspring metabolic waste and therefore can be regarded as an adaptation for viviparity.
