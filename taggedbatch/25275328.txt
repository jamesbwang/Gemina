 A complete and accurate count of the number of opioid-related overdose deaths is essential to properly allocate resources. We determined the rate of unintentional overdose deaths ( non-opioid-related , opioid-related , or unspecified) in the United States and by state from 1999 to 2015 and the possible effects of underreporting on national estimates of opioid abuse. We abstracted unintentional drug overdose deaths ( International Classification of Diseases , 10th Revision , codes X40-X44) with contributory drug-specific T codes ( T36.0-T50.9) from the Mortality Multiple Cause Micro-Data Files. We assumed that the proportion of unspecified overdose deaths that might be attributed to opioids would be the same as the proportion of opioid-related overdose deaths among all overdose deaths and calculated the number of deaths that could be reallocated as opioid-related for each state and year. We then added these reallocated deaths to the reported deaths to determine their potential effect on total opioid-related deaths. From 1999 to 2015 , a total of 438607 people died from unintentional drug overdoses. Opioid-related overdose deaths rose 401 % ( from 5868 to 29383) , non-opioid-related overdose deaths rose 150 % ( from 3005 to 7505) , and unspecified overdose deaths rose 220 % ( from 2255 to 29383). In 5 states ( Alabama , Indiana , Louisiana , Mississippi , and Pennsylvania) , more than 35 % of unintentional overdose deaths were coded as unspecified. Our reallocation resulted in classifying more than 70000 unspecified overdose deaths as potential additional opioid-related overdose deaths. States may be greatly underestimating the effect of opioid-related overdose deaths because of incomplete cause-of-death reporting , indicating that the current opioid overdose epidemic may be worse than it appears.
