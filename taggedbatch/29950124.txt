 Progress testing is a longitudinal assessment that aims at tracking students ' development of knowledge. This approach is used in many medical schools internationally. Although progress tests are longitudinal in nature , and their focus and use of developmental aspects is a key advantage , individual students ' learning trajectories themselves play , to date , only a minor role in the use of the information obtained through progress testing. We investigate in how far between-person differences in initial levels of performance and within-person rate of growth can be regarded as distinct components of students ' development and analyze the extent to which these two components are related to performances on national licensing examinations using a latent growth curve model. Both , higher initial levels of performances and steepness of growth are positively related to long-term outcomes as measured by performance on national licensing examinations. We interpret these findings as evidence for progress tests ' suitability to monitor students ' growth of knowledge across the course of medical training. This study indicates that individual development as obtained by formative progress tests is related to performance in high-stakes assessments. Future studies may put more focus on the use of between-persons differences in growth of knowledge.
