 A popular interpretation of the `` collapse '' of the wave function is as being the result of a local interaction ( `` measurement '') of the quantum system with a macroscopic system ( `` detector '') , with the ensuing loss of phase coherence between macroscopically distinct components of its quantum state vector. Nevetheless as early as in 1953 Renninger suggested a Gedankenexperiment , in which the collapse is triggered by non-observation of one of two mutually exclusive outcomes of the measurement , i.e. , in the absence of interaction of the quantum system with the detector. This provided a powerful argument in favour of `` physical reality '' of ( nonlocal) quantum state vector. In this paper we consider a possible version of Renninger 's experiment using the light propagation through a birefringent quantum metamaterial. Its realization would provide a clear visualization of a wave function collapse produced by a `` non-measurement '' , and make the concept of a physically real quantum state vector more acceptable.
