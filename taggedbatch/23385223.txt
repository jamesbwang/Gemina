 In this paper we aimed to investigate the neovascularization and biodegradation of the silk fibroin in vivo using multiple modes ultrasound , including two-dimensional , three-dimensional and contrast-enhanced ultrasound by quantifying the echo intensity , volume and contrast enhancement of the silk fibroin implants. A total of 56 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups and 4 % ( w/v) silk hydrogels were injected subcutaneously at hind<symptom> limb or upper back of the rats respectively to compare the biodegradation rate in different sites of the body. The implants were observed at day 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 18 , 20 with multiple modes ultrasound. The echo intensity of silk fibroin implants increased and the volume decreased gradually , and complete degradation was confirmed 18 and 20 days after subcutaneous implantation at the upper back and at the hind<symptom> limb respectively. This demonstrated that the silk fibroin embedded in the upper back degraded slightly faster than that in the hind<symptom> limb. Additionally , the neovascularization revealed by the contrast enhancement values of CEUS showed that there was a relatively low enhancement ( < 5 dB) during day 4 to day 16 , followed by moderate enhancement at day 18 ( 5-20 dB) , and a significant enhancement at day 20 ( > 40 dB). This study suggests that multiple modes ultrasound imaging could be an ideal method to evaluate the degradation and neovascularization of biomaterial implants in vivo for surgical applications.
