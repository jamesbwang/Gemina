 Wildlife perceive humans as predators , and therefore normally flushes. Flight initiation distance ( FID) is the distance a human can approach an animal at a steady pace until it flushes. Recently , several studies showed differences in within-species FID according to human presence by comparing urban and rural habitats , with urban birds showing reduced FIDs. However , urban and rural habitats also differ in structure , which might affect FID. Therefore , in order to understand the real effect of human presence , we investigated whether differences in FID are also present in natural habitats ( forests) , differing only in the intensity of human use for recreation. We found that human frequentation had a distinct effect on bird escape responses , with shorter FIDs in forests more-heavily frequented by humans than in forests rarely visited by humans. Whether this finding is driven by non-random spatial distribution of personalities ( shy vs. bold) or phenotypic plasticity ( habituation to humans) can not be assessed with our data. Studies relying on FIDs should also incorporate human recreation intensity , as this affects the measurements strongly.
