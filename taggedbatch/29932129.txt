 The purpose of this study was to clarify the hepatoprotective mechanisms of fish oil in ethanol-fed rats based on lipid metabolism. Thirty eight-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into six groups: C ( control) , CF25 ( control diet with 25 % fish oil substitution) , CF57 ( control diet with 57 % fish oil substitution) , E ( ethanol-containing diet) group , EF25 ( ethanol-containing diet with 25 % fish oil substitution) , and EF57 ( ethanol-containing diet with 57 % fish oil substitution) groups. All of the groups were pair-fed an isoenergetic diet based on E group. Rats were sacrificed after eight weeks. When compared with C group , the plasma aspartate transaminase ( AST) activity and hepatic steatosis and inflammatory cell infiltration were significantly higher , while plasma adiponectin level and hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase & alpha; ( AMPK & alpha ;-RRB- protein expression was significantly lower in the E group. However , the hepatic damage , including steatosis and inflammation<symptom> were ameliorated in the EF25 and EF57 groups. Moreover , mRNA levels of fatty acid-oxidative enzymes , such as medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase ( MCAD) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I ( CPT-1) were significantly elevated in the EF57 group than those in E group. Partial replacement with fish oil might improve the fatty acid oxidation by raising mRNA levels of downstream transcription factors , finally inhibit the ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis in rats.
