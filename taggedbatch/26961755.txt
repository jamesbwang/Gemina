 Polyphagous insect herbivores possess diverse mechanisms to overcome challenges of feeding in multiple plant species including , but not limited to , transcriptional plasticity and associations with obligate or facultative symbionts. The Asian longhorned beetle ( Anoplophora glabripennis) is a polyphagous wood-feeder capable of developing on over 100 tree species and , like other polyphages , its genome contains amplifications of digestive and detoxification genes. This insect also possesses a diverse gut microbial community , which has the metabolic potential to augment digestive physiology. While the genomic repertoires of A. glabripennis and its microbial community have been studied previously , comparatively less is known about how the gut transcriptome and community change in response to feeding in different hosts. In this study , we show that feeding in two suitable hosts ( Acer spp. and Populus nigra) altered the expression levels of multicopy genes linked to digestion and detoxification. However , feeding in a host with documented resistance ( Populus tomentosa) induced changes in the transcriptome and community beyond what was observed in insects reared in P. nigra , including the downregulation of numerous Î²-glucosidases , odorant binding proteins , and juvenile hormone binding proteins , the upregulation of several cuticular genes , and the loss of one major bacterial family from the gut community.
