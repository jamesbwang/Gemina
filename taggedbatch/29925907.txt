 Increasing evidence suggests that the immune system affects prognosis of chronic myeloid leukemia<disease> ( CML) , but the detailed immunological composition of the leukemia<disease> bone<disease> marrow ( BM) microenvironment is unknown. We aimed to characterize the immune landscape of the CML BM and predict the current treatment goal of tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI) therapy , molecular remission 4.0 ( MR4 .0). Using multiplex immunohistochemistry ( mIHC) and automated image analysis , we studied BM tissues of CML patients ( n = 56) and controls ( n = 14) with a total of 30 immunophenotype markers essential in cancer immunology. CML patients ' CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells expressed higher levels of putative exhaustion<symptom> markers PD1 , TIM3 , and CTLA4 when compared to control. PD1 expression was higher in BM compared to paired peripheral blood ( PB) samples , and decreased during TKI therapy. By combining clinical parameters and immune profiles , low CD4 + T-cell proportion , high proportion of PD1 + TIM3-CD8 + T cells , and high PB neutrophil count were most predictive of lower MR4 .0 likelihood. Low CD4 + T-cell proportion and high PB neutrophil counts predicted MR4 .0 also in a validation cohort ( n = 52) analyzed with flow cytometry. In summary , the CML BM is characterized by immune suppression and immune biomarkers predicted MR4 .0 , thus warranting further testing of immunomodulatory drugs in CML treatment.
