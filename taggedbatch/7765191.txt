 Enzymatic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into soluble sugars is a major bottleneck in the plant biomass utilization. Several anaerobic organisms cope these issues via multiple-enzyme complex system so called ` cellulosome '. Hence , we proposed a `` biomimic operon '' concept for making an artificial cellulosome which can be used as a promising tool for the expression of cellulosomal enzymes in According to the proteomic analysis of In this study , a strategy for constructing an efficient cellulosome system was developed and two different artificial cellulosomal operons were constructed. Both operons could efficiently express the cellulosomal enzymes and exhibited cellulose saccharification. This strategy can be applied to different industries with cellulose-containing materials , such as papermaking , biofuel , agricultural compost , mushroom cultivation , and waste processing industries.
