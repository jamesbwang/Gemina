 Diffuse lymphocytic infiltration ( DLI) is frequently found with papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC) , so there has been long interest in how it affects the characteristics of PTC. This purpose of this study was to define the association between DLI and PTC aggressiveness according to thyroperoxidase antibody ( TPOAb) and B-type Raf ( BRAF) There were 1879 patients with PTC who underwent surgery and were enrolled in this study. Clinicopathologic characteristics were compared between groups according to the presence of DLI and TPOAb. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess odds ratio ( OR) for each dependent variable ( BRAF The DLI-positive PTC showed more frequent multifocality and less frequent BRAF Although DLI was associated with multifocality regardless of TPOAb positivity , it was associated with an indolent feature when TPOAb was positive but with aggressive features in PTC with wild-type BRAF when TPOAb was negative. The TPOAb and BRAF status may help to define the clinical implication of lymphocytic infiltration found with PTC.
