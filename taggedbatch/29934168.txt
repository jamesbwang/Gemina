 Cocoa beans are rich in bioactive phytochemicals such as alkaloids , anthocyanins , as well as monomeric and oligomeric flavan-3-ols. A high performance thin layer chromatography ( HPTLC) method was developed for a fast analysis of a fingerprint of bioactive compounds present in cocoa beans depending on genotype and origin. Evaluation was performed using HPTLC followed by densitometry. The best separation for a fingerprint consisting of eight phenolic compounds as markers was achieved on silica gel 60 F
