 Binge drinking prevalence rates are highest in young adults; however , little is known about the effects of binge drinking on blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) and other cardiovascular health metrics in individuals between 18 and 45 years of age. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of regular binge drinking on BP , lipid and glucose levels and to determine if there were differences in these associations between men and women. We analyzed data from NHANES ( the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) for men and women 18 to 45 years old who were non-binge drinkers , binge drank 1 to 12 times , or binge drank > 12 times in the past year. After controlling for diet and physical activity , both categories of men binge drinkers compared with non-binge drinkers had higher systolic BP ( 121.8 and 119.0 mm Hg versus 117.5 mm Hg) and total cholesterol ( 215.5 and 217.9 mg/dL versus 207.8 mg/dL) values. There were no effects of binge drinking on systolic BP or total cholesterol in women. Binge drinking in men and women was associated with higher high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol values. The effects of binge drinking on glucose parameters in men and women were variable. Compared with young adult women , repeated binge drinking in men was associated with an elevated systolic BP , and greater frequency of binge drinking in men was associated with a more unfavorable lipid profile. In young adults with elevated systolic BP , practitioners should consider the possible role of binge drinking and address the importance of reducing alcohol intake as an important cardiovascular risk reduction strategy.
