 To evaluate the long-term outcomes of Boston type I keratoprosthesis ( B-Kpro) in the management of patients with ocular burn injuries. This prospective study included all patients with ocular burns who underwent B-Kpro implantation at a tertiary eye care center between February 2008 and November 2015. Twelve patients ( 12 eyes) were enrolled. The procedures performed for managing ocular injury were identified , and information on ocular history , surgical procedures performed , and postoperative outcomes was collected. The main outcome measures were visual acuity , prosthesis retention , postoperative complications , and required surgical procedures. Twelve eyes from 12 patients met the inclusion criteria for B-Kpro implantation , including nine eyes with alkali burns and three eyes with thermal burns. A total of 13 B-Kpro devices were implanted in the 12 eyes. The mean follow-up period was 60.8 months ( range , 13-91 months). Preoperative best-corrected visual acuity ranged from counting fingers to light perception. Postoperative best-corrected visual acuity was better than 20/200 in 83.3 % , 66.6 % , and 57.1 % of patients at 12 , 48 , and 60 months , respectively. The initial keratoprosthesis was retained in 10 ( 83.3 %) eyes and was successfully replaced in one eye. The major cause of worsening of initial visual acuity was advanced glaucoma ( four of 12 eyes). The anatomical and functional results support the use of B-Kpro for managing bilateral limbal stem cell deficiency secondary to ocular burns. However , glaucoma should be carefully evaluated , as it is a continuous threat that may result in irreversible visual loss in this population.
