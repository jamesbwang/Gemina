 To evaluate abdominal ventral wound<disease><symptom> healing by using a specific biomaterial , a handmade polyamide surgical mesh. A surgical incisional defect was made in ten rabbits to simulate a hernia in the ventral abdominal musculature. A polyamide surgical mesh was used in hernioplasty. They were monitored for surgical wound<disease><symptom> healing , and macroscopically and histologically evaluated at the end of the experiment. The polyamide surgical mesh did not cause foreign body reaction , pain , edema<symptom> , or infection in the surgical<disease> site. The manure production was not affected by intestinal tissue adherences to the mesh , consistent with the ultrasonography result where adherences were not observed and organized scarring tissue formed in the incisional defect. The polyamide mesh was fixed over the abdominal wall , and its external and internal sides were surrounded by a vascularized connective tissue. None of the experimental animals developed adherences from internal organs<symptom> to the polyamide mesh , except two rabbits where the omentum formed adherence to the internal scarring tissue without present herniation or compromise of the rabbit 's health. Polyamide surgical mesh for hernioplasty presents , in rabbits , excellent biocompatibility , with minimal body adverse reactions and low cost.
