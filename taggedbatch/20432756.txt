 Lymphatic leishmaniasis<disease> is a rare parasitic<disease> disease<disease> even in endemic region. It is usually associated with visceral and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis<disease>. Leishmaniasis<disease> is being increasingly recognized in association with immunodeficient patients ( HIV/AIDS). However , leishmanial lymphadenitis<disease><symptom> has been rarely diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration cytology ( FNAC) of epitrochlear lymph node in an HIV<pathogen> patient. Cytological features of leishmanial lymphadenitis<disease><symptom> in an HIV-reactive patient have been rarely addressed in previous literature. We present the FNAC of a case of leishmanial lymphadenitis<disease><symptom> in epitrochlear lymph node in the case of an HIV-reactive patient with visceral leishmaniasis<disease>.
