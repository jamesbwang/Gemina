 Streamflow projections are fundamental sources for future water resources strategic planning and management , particularly in high-altitude scarcely-gauged basins located in high mountain<disease> Asia. Therefore , quantification of the climate change impacts on major hydrological components ( evapotranspiration , soil water storage , snowmelt-runoff , rainfall-runoff and streamflow) is of high importance and remains a challenge. For this purpose , we analysed general circulation models ( GCMs) using a multiple bias correction approach and two different hydrological models i.e. the Hydrological Modelling System ( HEC-HMS) and the Snowmelt Runoff Model ( SRM) , to examine the impact of climate change on the hydrological behaviour of the Jhelum River basin. Based on scrutiny , climate projections using four best fit CMIP5 GCMs ( i.e. BCC-CSM1.1 , INMCM4 , IPSL-CM5A-LR and CMCC-CMS) were chosen by evaluating linear scaling , local intensity scaling ( LOCI) and distribution mapping ( DM) approaches at twenty climate stations. Subsequently , after calibration and validation of HEC-HMS and SRM at five streamflow gauging stations , the bias corrected projected climate data was integrated with HEC-HMS and SRM to simulate projected streamflow. Results demonstrate that the DM approach fitted the projections best. The climate projections exhibited maximum intra-annual rises in precipitation by 183.2 mm ( 12.74 %) during the monsoon for RCP4 .5 and a rise in T
