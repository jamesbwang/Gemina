 To study the specific genes of mucoepidermoid carcinoma of mucus- like cancer cells of the salivary gland , and to further understand the mechanism of tumor stem cells. Single cell culture of tumor cells was performed by limited dilution method. The growth of tumor stem cells was observed. The relative specific surface markers of salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma stem cells were determined by immunomagnetic separation technology. The data were analyzed with SPSS 11.5 software package. The expression of CD133 was higher in the M3SP2 cell line , and the high expression of CD133 was significantly different （ P < 0.05 ）. CD133 may be one of the surface specific antigen markers of M3SP2 monoclonal cell lines in salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line.
