 Intramyocellular lipid ( IMCL) accumulation in skeletal muscle greatly contributes to lipid-induced insulin resistance. Because acetyl-coenzyme A ( CoA) carboxylase ( ACC) 2 negatively modulates mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation ( FAO) in skeletal muscle , ACC2 inhibition is expected to reduce IMCL via elevation of FAO and to attenuate insulin resistance. However , the concept of substrate competition suggests that enhanced FAO results in reduced glucose use because of an excessive acetyl-CoA pool in mitochondria. To identify how ACC2-regulated FAO affects IMCL accumulation and glucose metabolism , we generated ACC2 knockout ( ACC2-/-) mice and investigated skeletal muscle metabolites associated with fatty acid and glucose metabolism , as well as whole-body glucose metabolism. ACC2-/- mice displayed higher capacity of glucose disposal at the whole-body levels. In skeletal muscle , ACC2-/- mice exhibited enhanced acylcarnitine formation and reduced IMCL levels without alteration in glycolytic intermediate levels. Notably , these changes were accompanied by decreased acetyl-CoA content and enhanced mitochondrial pathways related to acetyl-CoA metabolism , such as the acetylcarnitine production and tricarboxylic acid cycle. Furthermore , ACC2-/- mice exhibited lower levels of IMCL and acetyl-CoA even under HFD conditions and showed protection against HFD-induced insulin resistance. Our findings suggest that ACC2 deletion leads to IMCL reduction without suppressing glucose use via an elevation in acetyl-CoA metabolism even under HFD conditions and offer new mechanistic insight into the therapeutic potential of ACC2 inhibition on insulin resistance.
