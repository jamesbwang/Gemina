 The epidemiological characteristics of chemical burns varies in different regions of the world. This study aims to survey the epidemiology , outcomes and costs of chemical burns in southwest China , to determine associated risk factors and to obtain data for developing an effective approach to prevent and treat chemical burns. This retrospective study includes 410 cases with chemical burns admitted to the Institute of Burn Research of Southwest Hospital from 2005 to 2016. Data , including demographic , etiology , outcomes and costs , were collected and analyzed. A total of 410 cases admitted to our burn center were included. The average age of the burn patients was 38.58 ± 14.66 years. The incidence of chemical burns peaked in autumn. The most common etiology were acids. Limbs were the most common burn sites ( 59.51 %). Average TBSA was 12.37 ± 18.67 %. The percentage of patients who underwent procedures and the number of procedures were significantly greater for TBSA and full-thickness burns. The mortality of chemical burns was 1.22 %. The median LOS and cost were 21 days and 65,852 CNY , respectively. The major risk factors for cost were the number of procedures , TBSA and full-thickness burns , the major risk factors for LOS were the number of procedures and outcome. Chemical burns mainly occurred in adult males with occupational exposures to chemical agents due to inappropriate operation. Emphasis on safety education for the public and professional pre-employment training for workers should become key preventive targets to reduce the incidence of chemical burns.
