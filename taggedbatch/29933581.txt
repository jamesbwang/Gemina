 The granulometric characterization of synthetic amorphous silica ( SAS) nanomaterials ( NMs) still demands harmonized standard operation procedures. SAS is produced as either precipitated , fumed ( pyrogenic) , gel and colloidal SAS and these qualities differ , among others , with respect to their state of aggregation and aggregate strength. The reproducible production of suspensions from SAS , e.g. , for biological testing purposes , demands a reasonable amount of dispersing energy. Using materials representative for each of the types of SAS , we employed ultrasonic dispersing ( USD) at energy densities of 8 ‚Åª 1440 J/mL and measured resulting particle sizes by dynamic light scattering and laser diffraction. In this energy range , USD had no significant impact on particle size distributions of colloidal and gel SAS , but clearly decreased the particle size of precipitated and fumed SAS. For high energy densities , we observed a considerable contamination of SAS suspensions with metal particles caused by abrasion of the sonotrode & rsquo; s tip. To avoid this problem , the energy density was limited to 270 J/mL and remaining coarse particles were removed with size-selective filtration. The ultrasonic dispersion of SAS at medium levels of energy density is suggested as a reasonable compromise to produce SAS suspensions for toxicological in vitro testing.
