 To review the evidence for a systematic relationship between cancer patients ' pre-treatment expectations ( anticipated side effects) and subsequent experience of treatment-related side effects , and to compare this relationship in patients with no prior treatment experience ( cognitive expectations) and with some prior treatment experience ( conditioned response). A total of 12,952 citations were identified through a comprehensive search of the literature published on or before November 2016 and screened against inclusion criteria. Studies were eligible if they included participants undergoing curative treatment for cancer , measured a treatment side effect , examined the relationship between anticipation and experience of side effects , and reported quantitative data. Thirty-one studies were included in the review and meta-analysis ( total N = 5069). The side effects examined were nausea<symptom> ( anticipatory and post-treatment) , vomiting , fatigue<symptom> , pain , problems with concentration , and skin reactions. Meta-analyses indicated positive associations between anticipation and subsequent experience for all included side effects in patients with no prior treatment exposure ( r = 0.153-0.431). Stronger associations were found for all included side effects in patients with previous treatment experience ( r = 0.211-0.476) , except for fatigue<symptom> ( r = 0.266) and pain ( r = 0.235). No significant differences were found when overall effect sizes for patients with and without prior treatment exposure were compared for each side effect , except for anticipatory nausea<symptom> ( p = 0.012). These results may have implications for future interventions that target patients ' expectations of cancer treatment-related side effects. Future research could explore patient reports of messages received about likely treatment effects both before and during treatment.
