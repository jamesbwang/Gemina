 In recent times , the treatment of harmful algal blooms ( HABs) became an important environmental issue to preserve and remediate water resources globally. In the present study , the adsorptive removal of harmful algal species Microcystis aeruginosa<pathogen> directly from an aqueous medium was attempted. Waste biomass ( Escherichia<pathogen> coli) was immobilized using polysulfone and coated using the cationic polymer polyethylenimine ( PEI) to generate PEI-coated polysulfone-biomass composite fiber ( PEI-PSBF). The density of M. aeruginosa<pathogen> in an aqueous medium ( BG11) was significantly decreased by treatment with PEI-PSBF. additionally , analysis using FE-SEM , confirmed that the removal of M. aeruginosa<pathogen> algal cells by PEI-PSBF was caused by the adsorption mechanism. According to the profiles of phosphorus for the algal cell growth in M. aeruginosa<pathogen> cultivating samples , we found that the adsorbed M. aeruginosa onto the PEI-PSBF lost their biological activity compared to the non-treated M. aeruginosa<pathogen> cells.
