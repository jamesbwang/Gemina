 T-cell receptor excision circles ( TRECs) and Îº-deleting recombination excision circles ( KRECs) are recently used for detection of T or B cell lymphopenia in neonates based on region-specific cutoff levels. Here , we report cutoffs for TREC and KREC copies useful for newborn screening and/or diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency<disease> diseases<disease> ( PID) in Iran. DNA was extracted from a single 3.2 mm punch of dried blood spots collected from 2160 anonymized newborns referred to two major referral health centers between 2014 and 2016. For refinement of the cutoffs , 51 patients with a definite diagnosis of severe combined immunodeficiency , X-linked agammaglobulinaemia and combined immunodeficiency , including ataxia<symptom> telangiectasia , human phosphoglucomutase 3 and Janus kinase-3 deficiency , as well as 47 healthy controls were included. Samples from patients with an X-linked hyper-IgM-syndrome , Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome<disease><symptom> and DNA ligase 4 deficiency were considered as disease controls. Triplex-quantitative real-time PCR was used. Cutoffs were calculated as TRECs < 11 and KRECs < 6 copies with an ACTB > 700 copies with sensitivity of 100 % for TREC and 97 % for KREC. Among thirty anonymized newborn samples ( 1.5 %) with abnormal results for TREC and/or KREC , only twenty one available cases were retested and shown to be in the normal range except for three samples ( 0.15 %). All of the patients with a definitive diagnosis were correctly identified based on our established TREC/KREC copy numbers. Determining cutoffs for TREC/KREC is essential for correctly identifying children with PID in newborn screening. Early diagnosis of PID patients enables appropriate measures and therapies like stem cell transplantation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
