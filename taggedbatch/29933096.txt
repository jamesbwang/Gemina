 Long-term use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF) reduces bone mineral density ( BMD). Tenofovir alafenamide ( TAF) , a new prodrug of tenofovir , has shown non-inferior efficacy to TDF in patients with chronic hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV) infection , with improved bone effects at 48 weeks. We performed a randomized trial to evaluate the bone safety of TAF compared with TDF over 2 years , assessing baseline risk factors for bone loss , were evaluated after 2 years of treatment. In a double-blind study , hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> e antigen ( HBeAg)- positive patients ( n = 873) and HBeAg-negative patients ( n = 425) were randomly assigned ( 2:1) to groups given TAF ( 25 mg , n = 866) or TDF ( 300 mg , n = 432) once daily. We assessed bone safety , including hip and spine BMD , using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and measured changes in serum markers of bone turnover over 96 weeks. At baseline , treatment groups were well matched. At week 96 , patients receiving TAF had significantly smaller decreases in hip BMD ( mean reduction of 0.33 %) than patients receiving TDF ( mean reduction of 2.51 %) ( P < .001) and spine BMD ( reduction of 0.75 % in patients receiving patients receiving TAF vs reduction of 2.57 % in patients receiving TDF) ( P < .001). For hip BMD , the magnitude of difference in bone loss between the TAF and TDF groups increased at week 96 compared to week 48 ( P < .001). The TAF group had minimal changes in markers of bone turnover by 12 weeks of treatment , but the TDF group had significant changes , compared to baseline. Risk factors for bone loss had fewer effects in patients receiving TAF than TDF at week 96. In double-blind randomized trials , we found that after 2 years of treatment , patients receiving TAF had continued improvements in bone safety compared with patients receiving TDF.
