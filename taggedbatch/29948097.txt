 Knowledge of age-related nasal region measurements in Anatolian men; growth changes between adult and old age. The nose plays a critical role in determining the external appearance of an individual. Craniofacial anthropometry has been commonly used in forensic anthropology and medicine. A total of 300 men ( 100 between 20-40 years; 100 between 40-60 years and 100 60-up years) were measured using a photographic technic from the Image J program. From the landmarks , 13 linear distances and 3 angles were calculated and averaged for age groups. The means of nasal bridge lengths of three age groups were 60.30 , 63.43 and 64.63 mm , respectively. The average nasal tip protrusions of three groups were 24.31 , 26.69 and 27.53 mm , respectively. Nasolabial angle , nasal bridge length and tip protrusion , anatomic and morphologic nose width and root width were statistically different between the three age groups ( p < 0.05). Results collected in this study could serve as a data bank for nasal anthropometry during aging and development. The assessment of teratogenic-induced traumas , craniofacial alteration , facial reconstruction , aging of dead person and personal identification may be assisted by age data from Anatolian men from age data banks.
