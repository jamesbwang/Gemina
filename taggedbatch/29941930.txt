 Cellular senescence is a tumour suppressor programme characterized by a stable cell cycle arrest. Here we report that cellular senescence triggered by a variety of stimuli leads to diminished ribosome biogenesis and the accumulation of both rRNA precursors and ribosomal proteins. These defects were associated with reduced expression of several ribosome biogenesis factors , the knockdown of which was also sufficient to induce senescence. Genetic analysis revealed that Rb but not p53 was required for the senescence response to altered ribosome biogenesis. Mechanistically , the ribosomal protein S14 ( RPS14 or uS11) accumulates in the soluble non-ribosomal fraction of senescent cells , where it binds and inhibits CDK4 ( cyclin-dependent kinase 4). Overexpression of RPS14 is sufficient to inhibit Rb phosphorylation , inducing cell cycle arrest and senescence. Here we describe a mechanism for maintaining the senescent cell cycle arrest that may be relevant for cancer therapy , as well as biomarkers to identify senescent cells.
