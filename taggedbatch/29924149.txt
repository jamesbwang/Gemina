 Describe the processes of translation to the Portuguese language and cultural adaptation of the Postpartum Learning Needs ( PLN) to the Portuguese context. Methodological study of an instrument that was constructed and validated in Jordan. Here are presented the procedures referring to linguistic , semantic and cultural validation , involving the stages of translation from English to European Portuguese , synthesis of translations , back-translation to the original language , expert committee , and pre-testing. In the translation process , some vocabulary variations were solved through consensus among translators. The expert committee found that the version translated to Portuguese presented semantic , idiomatic , cultural and conceptual equivalence , while needing some adjustments. Pre-testing was applied to 45 adolescent mothers , of whom 86.6 % considered the items comprehensible. Semantic , idiomatic , cultural and conceptual equivalences were conceptually satisfactory among questionnaire versions , which is relevant for the Portuguese culture and easily understandable. It is crucial to assess the psychometric properties of the questionnaire so its adapted version can be made available.
