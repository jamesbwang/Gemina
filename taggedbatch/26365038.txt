 Interactions between microorganisms and algae<pathogen> during bloom events significantly impacts their physiology , alters ambient chemistry , and shapes ecosystem diversity. The potential role these interactions have in bloom development and decline are also of particular interest given the ecosystem impacts of algal blooms. We hypothesized that microbial community structure and succession is linked to specific bloom stages , and reflects complex interactions among taxa comprising the phycosphere environment. This investigation used pyrosequencing and correlation approaches to assess patterns and associations among bacteria , archaea , and microeukaryotes during a spring bloom of the dinoflagellate
