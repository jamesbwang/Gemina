 Flavonoids exert innumerable beneficial effects on cardiovascular health including the reduction of platelet activation , and thereby , thrombosis. Hence , flavonoids are deemed to be a molecular template for the design of novel therapeutic agents for various diseases including thrombotic conditions. However , the structure-activity relationships of flavonoids with platelets is not fully understood. Therefore , this study aims to advance the current knowledge on structure-activity relationships of flavonoids through a systematic analysis of structurally-related flavones. Here , we investigated a panel of 16 synthetic flavones containing hydroxy or methoxy groups at C-7,8 positions on the A-ring , with a phenyl group or its bioisosteres as the B-ring , along with their thio analogues possessing a sulfur molecule at the 4
