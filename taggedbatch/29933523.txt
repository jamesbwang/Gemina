 As several diseases have been linked to dysbiosis of the human intestinal microflora , manipulation of the microbiota has emerged as an exciting new strategy for potentially treating and preventing diseases. However , the human microbiota consists of a plethora of different species , and distinguishing the impact of a specific bacterial species on human health is challenging. In tackling this challenge , the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster , with its far simpler microbial composition , has emerged as a powerful model for unraveling host-microbe interactions. To study the interplay between the resident commensal microbiome and the host , flies can be made germ-free , or axenic. To elucidate the impact of specific bacteria , axenic flies can then be re-introduced to specific microbial species. In this unit , we provide a step-by-step protocol on how to rear Drosophila melanogaster under axenic conditions and confirm the axenity of flies. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
