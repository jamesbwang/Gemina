 A disaccharide , trehalose , is a main hemolymph sugar of the legume pod borer , Maruca vitrata larvae , but its titers fluctuated with feeding activity. During diurnal feeding in the photophase , hemolymph trehalose remained at a relatively low level ( 69 mM) and increased ( 98 mM) during scotophase. Starvation significantly increased the hemolymph trehalose level , in which the elevation of trehalose titers was dependent on the non-feeding period. The down-regulation of the trehalose level during the active feeding period seemed to result from mediation of the insulin/IGF signal ( IIS). Injection of a porcine insulin suppressed the trehalose level in a dose-dependent manner. Genes associated with IIS of M. vitrata were predicted from its larval transcriptome , and their expression was confirmed in different developmental stages and tissues. All seven IIS genes selected were expressed in all developmental stages and different tissues. Silencing of four IIS genes ( insulin receptor , Forkhead box O , a serine-threonine protein kinase , target of rapamycin) by RNA interference significantly modulated the hemolymph trehalose level. Starvation treatment changed expression of two trehalose metabolism-associated genes ( trehalose phosphate synthase ( TPS) and trehalase ( TRE)) as well as the IIS genes. Silencing of TPS or TRE expression significantly down- or up-regulated the hemolymph trehalose level , respectively. In addition , silencing of IIS genes altered both TPS and TRE expression , indicating a functional link between IIS and trehalose metabolism. These results suggest that nutrients obtained from feeding activate IIS of M. vitrata , which then down-regulates the hemolymph trehalose level by altering trehalose metabolism.
