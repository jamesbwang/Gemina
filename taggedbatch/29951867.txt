 Psychosomatic symptoms and mental health problems are highly prevalent in multimorbid elderly people challenging general practitioners to differentiate between normal stress and psychopathological conditions. The 4DSQ is a Dutch questionnaire developed to detect anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> , somatization , and distress in primary care. This study aims to analyze measurement equivalence between a German version and the original Dutch instrument. A Dutch and a German sample of multimorbid elderly people , matched by gender and age , were analyzed. Equivalence of scale structures was assessed by confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA). To evaluate measurement equivalence across languages , differential item functioning ( DIF) was analyzed using Mantel-Haenszel method and hybrid ordinal logistic regression analysis. Differential test functioning ( DTF) was assessed using Rasch analysis. A total of 185 German and 185 Dutch participants completed the questionnaire. The CFA confirmed one-factor models for all scales of both 4DSQ versions. Nine items in three scales were flagged with DIF. The anxiety<symptom> scale showed to be free of DIF. DTF analysis revealed negligible scale impact of DIF. The German 4DSQ demonstrated measurement equivalence to the original Dutch instrument. Hence , it can be considered a valid questionnaire for the screening for mental health problems in primary care.
