 Enantiomeric carbon dots ( C-dots) synthesized from l-lysine or d-lysine , modulate aggregation and cytotoxicity of amyloid beta-42 ( Aβ42) , the primary constituent of the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer 's disease. In particular , l-Lys-C-dots dramatically remodeled Aβ42 secondary structure and fibril morphologies , as well as inhibited Aβ42 cytotoxicity and membrane interactions.
