 The TOR<pathogen> ( Target of Rapamycin) pathway is a highly-conserved signaling pathway in eukaryotes that regulates cellular growth and stress responses. The cellular response to amino acids or carbon sources such as glucose requires anchoring of the TOR<pathogen> kinase complex to the lysosomal/vacuolar membrane by the Ragulator ( mammals) or EGO ( yeast) protein complex. Here we report a connection between the TOR<pathogen> pathway and circadian ( daily) rhythmicity. The molecular mechanism of circadian rhythmicity in all eukaryotes has long been thought to be transcription/translation feedback loops ( TTFLs). In the model eukaryote Neurospora<pathogen> crassa , a TTFL including FRQ ( frequency) and WCC ( white collar complex) has been intensively studied. However , it is also well-known that rhythmicity can be seen in the absence of TTFL functioning. We previously isolated uv90 as a mutation that compromises FRQ-less rhythms and also damps the circadian oscillator when FRQ is present. We have now mapped the uv90 gene and identified it as NCU05950 , homologous to the TOR<pathogen> pathway proteins EGO1 ( yeast) and LAMTOR1 ( mammals) , and we have named the N. crassa protein VTA ( vacuolar TOR-associated protein). The protein is anchored to the outer vacuolar membrane and deletion of putative acylation sites destroys this localization as well as the protein 's function in rhythmicity. A deletion of VTA is compromised in its growth responses to amino acids and glucose. We conclude that a key protein in the complex that anchors TOR to the vacuole plays a role in maintaining circadian ( daily) rhythmicity. Our results establish a connection between the TOR<pathogen> pathway and circadian rhythms and point towards a network integrating metabolism and the circadian system.
