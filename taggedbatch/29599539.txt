 Growing to lengths and weights exceeding 1.5 m and 45 kg , the hump-backed mahseer fish of the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot , India , is an iconic , mega-faunal species that is globally recognized as a premier freshwater game fish. Despite reports of their high extinction risk , conservation approaches are currently constrained by their lack of valid taxonomic identity. Using an integrative approach , incorporating morphology , molecular analysis and historical photographs , this fish can now be revealed to be conspecific with Tor<pathogen> remadevii , a species lacking a common name , that was initially , but poorly , described in 2007 from the River Pambar , a tributary of the River Cauvery in Kerala. Currently known to be endemic and restricted to the River Cauvery basin in the Western Ghats , T. remadevii is distinguished from congeners by its prominent hump originating above the pre-opercle and extending to the origin of the dorsal fin , a well-developed mandible resulting in a terminal or slightly superior mouth<symptom> position , and the dorsal orientation of the eyes. While body colouration varies ( silver , bronze , greenish) and is not considered a reliable diagnostic character , orange coloration of the caudal fin ( sometimes extending to all fins) is considered a consistent characteristic. Having been first brought to the attention of the scientific community in 1849 , and the recreational angling ( game fishing) community in 1873 , it has taken over 150 years to finally provide this iconic fish with a valid scientific name. This taxonomic clarity should now assist development and delivery of urgent conservation actions commensurate with their extinction risk.
