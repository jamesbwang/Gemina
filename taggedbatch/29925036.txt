 Lignin is one of the major components of lignocellulose biomass and chemically degrades into phenolic aldehydes including 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde , vanillin , and syringaldehyde. No lipid accumulation from the phenolic aldehydes by oleaginous microbes had been succeeded. Compared with vanillin and syringaldehyde , T. cutaneum<pathogen> ACCC 20271 have better tolerance to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. 4-Hydroxybenzaldehyde was found to be able as the substrate for lipid accumulation , while vanillin and syringaldehyde were only converted to less toxic phenolic alcohols and acids without observable lipid accumulation , perhaps due to the space shelling of methoxyl group ( s) in the structures. A long term fed batch fermentation of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde accumulated 0.85 g L
