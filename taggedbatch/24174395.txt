 The patient 's consent to a medical procedure must be preceded by a pre-procedure discussion with the physician that is documented on a standardized form. Evidence suggests that these forms lack information that would be relevant for an informed decision. We carried out a systematic literature search up to February 2017 for evidence on the quality and efficacy of informed consent forms. The definition of criteria for the evaluation of meta-information , content , and presentation were derived from current guidelines for evidence-based health information. As an example , we analyzed consent forms currently in use in Germany for 10 medical interventions with regard to decisionally relevant content and intelligibility of format. Our literature search yielded 14 content analyses , which revealed that even some of the more important evaluative criteria were not always met , including information on benefits ( 9/14) , risks ( 14/14) , alternatives ( 11/14) , the option of doing nothing ( 6/14) , and numerical frequencies ( 2/14). All analyses indicated deficiencies in the content of the consent forms. We then analyzed 37 consent forms obtained from publishing companies ( across Germany) and physician 's practices in Hamburg. These forms were found to contain information on: the intervention ( 37/37) , benefits ( 30/37) , risks ( 37/37) , alternatives ( 26/37) , the option of doing nothing ( 4/37) , numerical frequencies ( 10/37) , the names of the authors ( 17/37) , sources of information ( 0/37) , and date of issue ( 21/37). Both the evidence from foreign countries and our own analysis of the consent forms now in use in Germany revealed deficiencies , particularly in the communication of risks. New standards are needed to promote well-informed decision-making. Structural changes in the process of patient information and decision-making should be discussed.
