 Humans have always affected their ecosystems , but finding evidence for significant and lasting changes to preindustrial landscapes is rare. We report on human-caused changes to the nitrogen cycle in Ireland in the Bronze Age , associated with intensification of agriculture and animal husbandry that resulted in long-term changes to the nitrogen isotope values of animals ( wild and domesticates) during the Holocene. Major changes to inputs and cycling of soil nitrogen occurred through deforestation , land clearance and management , and more intensive animal husbandry and cereal crop cultivation in the later Bronze Age; after this time , the Irish landscape took on its current form. Within the debate concerning the onset of the Anthropocene , our data suggest that human activity in Ireland was significant enough in the Bronze Age to have long-term impact , thereby marking a profound shift in the relationship between humans and their environment.
