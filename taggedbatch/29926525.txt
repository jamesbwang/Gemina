 Hikikomori , a form of severe social withdrawal , is an emerging issue in mental health , for which validated measurement tools are lacking. The object was to develop a self-report scale of hikikomori , and assess its psychometric properties and diagnostic accuracy. A sample of 399 participants from clinical and community settings completed measures. Psychometric properties were assessed with factor analysis; diagnostic accuracy was compared against a semi-structured diagnostic interview. The Hikikomori Questionnaire contained 25 items across three subscales representing socialization , isolation , and emotional support. Internal consistency , test-retest reliability , and convergent validity were all satisfactory. The area under the curve was 0.86 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.80-0.92). A cut-off score of 42 ( out of 100) was associated with a sensitivity of 94 % , specificity of 61 % , and positive predictive value of 17 %. The 25-item Hikikomori Questionnaire ( HQ-25) possesses robust psychometric properties and diagnostic accuracy in an initial sample of Japanese adults. Additional research on its psychometric properties and ability to support clinical assessment of hikikomori is warranted.
