 Assessment of whole body protein turnover ( WBPT) can provide fundamental information about protein kinetics which underpins the conservation of lean tissue. Reliability and methodology studies on the measurement of WBPT are scarce. This study aimed to assess the effects of urine collection duration ( 9 versus 12 h) and the reproducibility of WBPT with the end product method calculated from ammonia<pathogen> as the end product. WBPT was assessed in 21 healthy participants ( 11 M , 10F) on 2 test days. WBPT was assessed using the end product method with a single dose of The CV for protein flux averaged 10 % and 12 % for 9 and 12-h urine collections respectively. Protein flux , synthesis and balance<symptom> were significantly higher and protein breakdown significantly lower with 9-h urine collections compared to 12-h collections ( P < 0.01) and there was a trend towards increasingly greater overestimation of 9-h calculated WBPT kinetics with greater overall rates of WBPT. Correlations between the 9 and 12-h values were strong ( r > 0.962 , P < 0.001 for all variables). The reproducibility of WBPT with ammonia<pathogen> as the end product was similar to previously reported reproducibility of the gold standard precursor technique. The use of a 12-h urine collection is more effective to achieve full turnover of the ammonia<pathogen> free amino acid ( AA) pool.
