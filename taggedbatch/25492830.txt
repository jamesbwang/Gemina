 Sodium and fluid retention is a hallmark and a therapeutic challenge of the nephrotic syndrome<disease><symptom> ( NS). Studies support the `` overfill '' theory of NS with pathophysiological proteolytic activation of the epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC) which explains the common observation of suppressed renin- angiotensin system and poor therapeutic response to ACE inhibitors. Blockade of ENaC by the diuretic amiloride would be a rational intervention compared to the traditionally used loop diuretics. We describe a 38-year-old male patient with type1 diabetes who developed severe hypertension ( 200/140 mmHg) , progressive<symptom> edema<symptom> ( of at least 10 L) , and overt proteinuria<symptom> ( 18.5 g/24 h) , despite combined administration of five antihypertensive drugs. Addition of amiloride ( 5 mg/day) to treatment resulted in resolution of edema<symptom> , weight<symptom> loss<symptom> of 7 kg , reduction in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( 150/100- 125/81 mmHg) , increased 24 h urinary sodium excretion ( 127-165 mmol/day) , decreased eGFR ( 41-29 mL/min) , and increased plasma potassium concentration ( 4.6-7.8 mmol/L). Blocking of ENaC mobilizes nephrotic edema<symptom> and lowers blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in NS. However , acute kidney injury and dangerous hyperkalemia is a potential risk if amiloride is added to multiple other antihypertensive medications as ACEi and spironolactone. The findings support that ENaC is active in NS and is a relevant target in adult NS patients.
