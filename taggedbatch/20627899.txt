 Iron ( Fe) is an essential mineral element required for plant growth , and when soil availability of Fe is low , plants show symptoms of severe deficiency. Under conditions of Fe deficiency , plants alter several processes to acquire Fe from soil. In this study , we used rice cultivars H 9405 with high Fe accumulation in seeds and Yang 6 with low Fe accumulation in seeds to study their physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> to different conditions of Fe availability. In both shoots and roots , the responses of ROS enzymes , leaf and root ultrastructure and photosynthetic system to iron deficiency in Yang 6 were much sensitive than those in H 9405. For the distribution of iron , the iron content was much higher in roots of Yang 6 , in contrast to higher shoot content in H 9405. Differential responses were shown with the Fe content in roots and shoots , which were the opposite in the two varieties; thus , we proposed the existence of long-distance signals. Then split root and shoot removal experiments were used to demonstrate that a long-distance signal was involved in the iron-deficient rice plant , and the signal strength was highly correlated with the functional leaves.
