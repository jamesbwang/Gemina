 Phencyclidine ( PCP , `` angel dust '' , an arylcyclohexylamine) was the first non-natural , man-made illicit drug of abuse , and was coined ` the most dangerous drug in America '' in the late 1970s ( amidst sensational horror stories of the drug 's effects); however , few other illicit drugs have had such a significant and broad impact on society-both good and bad. Originally developed as a new class of anesthetic , PCP-derived psychosis gave way to the PCP hypothesis of schizophrenia ( later coined the NMDA receptor hypofunction hypothesis or the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia) , which continues to drive therapeutic discovery for schizophrenia today. PCP also led to the discovery of ketamine ( and a new paradigm for the treatment of major depression<symptom>) , as well as other illicit , designer drugs , such as methoxetamine ( MXE) and a new wave of Internet commerce for illicit drugs ( sold as research chemicals , or RCs). Furthermore , PCP is a significant contaminant/additive of many illegal drugs sold today , due to its ease of preparation by clandestine chemists. Here , we will review the history , importance , synthesis ( both legal and clandestine) , pharmacology , drug metabolism , and folklore of PCP , a true DARK classic in chemical neuroscience.
