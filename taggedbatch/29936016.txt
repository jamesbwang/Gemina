 Breast cancer , historically a disease of more affluent women , has increased in incidence for women from areas of greater social deprivation , yet prognosis is worse for these women. This study identifies differences in presentation , treatment and prognostic factors between the socioeconomic groups. Patient data obtained from the prospectively maintained Welsh national Cancer Network Information System Cymru , for an 11-year period , were categorised according to Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles. Quintiles were compared for differences in variables relating to patient characteristics , detection of cancer , tumour biology and treatment. 1570 patients were included. Analysis showed that in the more socially deprived quintiles , there are proportionally fewer women being diagnosed through the NHS breast cancer screening programme and as a consequence greater numbers of women from poorer areas being diagnosed outwith the screening age parameters. Screen detection is strongly associated with better prognosis in terms of Nottingham Prognostic Index. Similarly , increasing levels of social deprivation are associated with higher incidence of oestrogen receptor negative and triple negative tumours , both features associated with a shorter disease free and overall survival. Other variables of tumour biology , rates and type of surgical and adjuvant treatment were similar across social deprivation quintiles. There is a trend of reduced early detection of breast cancer in South East Wales in those patients living in areas of higher social deprivation. Given that there is equity in access to treatment within NHS , which is free for patients at the point of care , further study is warranted to address this existing disparity. Population cancer surveillance will need to inform both public health and NHS service responses , to continue to achieve improvements. Health trends may yet alter depending on current and future shifts in governmental health policy.
