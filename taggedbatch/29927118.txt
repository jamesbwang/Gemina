 Meiosis is essential during sexual reproduction to generate haploid gametes. Genomic or epigenomic studies of meiosis in multicellular organisms using next-generation sequencing ( NGS) methods have been limited because of the difficulty of collecting thousands to millions of meiocytes. Here , we describe a simple protocol to efficiently isolate maize male meiocytes from formaldehyde-fixed samples for NGS techniques that require chemical crosslinking to preserve complex interactions or chromatin architecture. Anthers at desired meiotic stages are selected , fixed with paraformaldehyde , and disrupted using a homogenizer. Cell walls are digested to produce a cell suspension containing small somatic cells and large individual meiocytes. The meiocyte fraction is enriched by size separation with cell strainers and further purified by flow cytometry. From 400 anthers , we can isolate 20,000 meiocytes at 98 % purity in 6 to 8 hours.
