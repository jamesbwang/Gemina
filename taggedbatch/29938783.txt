 Chemotherapy-induced skin sclerosis is generally not associated with other manifestations of systemic sclerosis. It is featured by skin sclerosis without visceral involvement ( i.e. , Raynaud 's phenomenon , esophageal dysmotility , and pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease>) , temporal association with chemotherapy administration , and the absence of detectable autoantibodies. The clinical course of scleroderma-like changes induced by paclitaxel or gemcitabine is refractory to treatment and commonly progressive , even after discontinuation of the triggering drugs. Report a case of scleroderma-like cutaneous lesions<symptom> during combination treatment with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in a patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and determine other published cases of scleroderma-like skin<symptom> changes<symptom> following treatment with nab-paclitaxel , paclitaxel , or gemcitabine through the period from 2002 to 2018. Literature search from the year 2002 onwards using combinations of `` Scleroderma '' AND `` paclitaxel , '' AND/OR `` gemcitabine. '' Additional to our case report we reviewed 14 other cases in the literature. Most of these cases share three prominent features: skin sclerosis without systemic involvement , temporal association with chemotherapy administration , and absence of detectable scleroderma-specific autoantibodies. To our knowledge , this is the first case report of scleroderma-like cutaneous lesions<symptom> during combination treatment with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in a patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However , given the current literature , these scleroderma-like lesions<symptom> are most likely induced by nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel , rather than by gemcitabine.
