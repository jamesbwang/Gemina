 In the marine environment , understanding the biophysical mechanisms that drive variability in larval dispersal and population connectivity is essential for estimating the potential impacts of climate change on the resilience and genetic structure of populations. Species whose populations are small , isolated and discontinuous in distribution will differ fundamentally in their response and resilience to environmental stress , compared with species that are broadly distributed , abundant and frequently exchange conspecifics. Here , we use an individual-based modelling approach , combined with a population genetics projection model , to consider the impacts of a warming climate on the population connectivity of two contrasting Antarctic fish species ,
