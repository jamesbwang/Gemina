 Although a two-stage exchange revision is reported to have a high success rate , this strategy may fail as a treatment for prosthetic joint infection ( PJI). When it does , resection arthroplasty , arthrodesis , amputation , and chronic antibiotic suppression may play a role. The purpose of this review is to determine which are the main risk factors for a two-stage exchange failure and to analyze the indications and results of resection arthroplasty , arthrodesis , amputation , and antibiotic chronic suppression for PJI. Recent literature demonstrates that the main risk factors for a two-stage exchange failure are as follows: hemodialysis , obesity , multiple previous procedures , diabetes mellitus , corticosteroid therapy , hypoalbuminemia , immunosuppression , rheumatological conditions , coagulation disorders , and infection due to multidrug-resistant ( MDR) bacteria or fungal species. Regarding microorganisms , besides Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , Streptococcus<pathogen> spp. , Enterobacteriaceae species such as Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> and Enterobacter<pathogen> sp. , Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , or Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> , and fungus including Candida sp. are also considered risk factors for a two-stage exchange failure. Resection arthroplasty , arthrodesis , and amputation have a limited role. Chronic suppression is an option for high-risk patients or unfeasible reconstruction. In summary , we report the main risk factors for a two-stage exchange failure and alternative procedures when it occurs. Future research on patient-specific risk factors for a two-stage exchange may aid surgical decision-making and optimization of outcomes.
