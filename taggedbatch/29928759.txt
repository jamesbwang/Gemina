 The PainFree Smart Shock<symptom> Technology ( SST) study showed a low ICD inappropriate shock<symptom> rate. However , the majority of patients were from Western countries with patient characteristics different from those in Japan. ICD shock<symptom> rates using the novel SST algorithms in Japanese patients are still unknown. All 2,770 patients in the PainFree SST study ( Japan ( JPN): N = 181 , other geographies ( OJPN): N = 2,589) were included in this analysis. Japanese patients had higher average LVEF ( P < 0.0001) , higher prevalence of secondary prevention indications ( P < 0.0001) , non-ischemic cardiomyopathy ( P < 0.0001) , and permanent AF ( P < 0.0001). The appropriate shock<symptom> rate at 12 months was not different between JPN and OJPN: 6.4 % and 6.3 % , respectively ( P = 0.95). The inappropriate shock<symptom> rate at 12 months was significantly higher in Japanese patients ( 2.9 % vs. 1.7 % , P = 0.017). However , after propensity score matching to adjust for the difference in baseline characteristics , the difference in inappropriate shock<symptom> rate was not statistically significant ( P = 0.51). There was no difference in the appropriate shock<symptom> rate between Japan and other geographies. The inappropriate shock<symptom> rate in Japan was low , although it was slightly higher compared to other geographies due to baseline characteristics including a higher prevalence of permanent AF. There was not a statistically significant difference after adjusting for baseline characteristics. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
