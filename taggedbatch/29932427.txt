 We consider a network topology according to the cortico-cortical connection network of the human brain , where each cortical area is composed of a random network of adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons. Depending on the parameters , this neuron model can exhibit spike or burst patterns. As a diagnostic tool to identify spike and burst patterns we utilise the coefficient of variation of the neuronal inter-spike interval. In our neuronal network , we verify the existence of spike and burst synchronisation in different cortical areas. Our simulations show that the network arrangement , i.e. its rich-club organisation , plays an important role in the transition of the areas from desynchronous to synchronous behaviours.
