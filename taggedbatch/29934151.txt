 The stability of anthocyanins in bokbunja ( Rubus occidentalis L.) extract was investigated using an in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Ethanolic extract from bokbunja was digested with pepsin/HCl for 2 h at 37 °C , followed by pancreatin/bile salts for 2 h at 37 °C. Four anthocyanins including cyanidin-3-glucoside , cyanidin-3-sambubioside , cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside and cyanidin-rutinoside were identified in the bokbunja extract. The total anthocyanin content of bokbunja was 3.76 mg cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents/g fresh weight ( FW). Gastric digestion had no significant effect on anthocyanins. However , intestinal digestion substantially decreased anthocyanins up to 1.70 mg/g FW , corresponding to 45 % of that in the bokbunja extract. This indicates that about half of anthocyanins can reach an intestinal tract. In addition , a new compound comprised of cyanidin-3-glucosdie , catechin and acetaldehyde in a separated study was observed after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. This shows that anthocyanins could be transformed into other compounds with different biochemical properties.
