 Catgut implantation at acupoints has been shown to alleviate spasticity after stroke in rats. However , the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study , we used the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke. Three days after surgery , absorbable surgical catgut sutures were implanted at Dazhui ( GV14) , Jizhong ( GV6) , Houhui , Guanyuan ( CV4) and Zhongwan ( CV12). The Zea Longa score was used to assess neurological function. The Modified Ashworth Scale was used to evaluate muscle tension. The 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride assay was used to measure infarct volume. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for glutamate aspartate transporter ( GLAST) and glial glutamate transporter-1 ( GLT-1) expression. Western blot assay was used to analyze the expression of GLAST and GLT-1. Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction were carried out to assess the expression of GLAST and GLT-1 mRNAs. After catgut implantation at the acupoints , neurological function was substantially improved , muscle tension was decreased , and infarct volume was reduced in rats with spasticity after stroke. Furthermore , the expression of GLAST and GLT-1 mRNAs was increased on the injured ( left) side. Our findings demonstrate that catgut implantation at acupoints alleviates spasticity after stroke , likely by increasing the expression of GLAST and GLT-1.
