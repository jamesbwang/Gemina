 Molecularly imprinted covalent organic polymers were constructed by an imine-linking reaction between 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol and 2,6-diaminopyridine and used for the selective solid-phase extraction of benzoxazole fluorescent whitening agents from food samples. Binding experiments showed that imprinting sites on molecularly imprinted polymers had higher selectivity for targets compared with those of the corresponding non-imprinted polymers. Parameters affecting the solid-phase extraction procedure were examined. Under optimal conditions , actual samples were treated and the eluent was analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection. The results showed that the established method has a wide linearity , satisfactory detection limits and quantification limits , and acceptable recoveries. Thus , this developed method possesses the practical potential for the selective determination of benzoxazole fluorescent whitening agents in complex food samples.
