 Bladder cancer ( BC) is one of the most frequent urological malignancies , and its molecular mechanism still remains unclear. Recent studies have revealed that MicroRNA ( miRNAs) acted as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in a variety of cancers. MiRNA-96 has been reported to play a significant role in the development and progression of many cancers. In the current study , we found that transforming growth factor ( TGF)- β1 played a significant role in the progression that miR-96 conducted. And TGF-β1 could also regulate the expression of FOXQ1 , which is the target gene of miR-96. Furthermore , miR-96 induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in BC cells , which is driven by TGF-β1. In conclusion , our data revealed that miR-96 regulates the progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition , which is driven by TGF-β1 in BC cells; it may provide a new thought for the therapy of BC.
