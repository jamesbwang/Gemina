 A novel algal-bacterial symbiosis system based on sequencing batch suspended biofilm reactor ( A-SBSBR) was developed for simultaneously enhanced nitrogen ( N) and phosphorus ( P) removal from domestic wastewater. Results showed that the total N ( TN) and P ( TP) removal efficiencies in A-SBSBR increased to 69.91 % and 94.78 % , respectively. The mechanism analysis indicated that TN removal mainly occurred at non-aeration stage , and TP removal happened during the whole cycle in A-SBSBR. Compared to control SBSBR , TN removal by denitrification and anabolism and TP removal by anabolism in A-SBSBR increased by 12.70 % , 7.64 % and 50.13 % , respectively. The Chlorophyll a accumulation in biofilm increased to 4.80 Â± 0.08 mg/g. Algae<pathogen> related to Chlorella and Scenedesmus and bacteria related to Flavobacterium , Micropruina and Comamonadaceae were enriched in A-SBSBR and responsible for the enhanced nutrients removal effect. This study may provide a new solution to achieve nutrients removal enhancement from wastewater.
