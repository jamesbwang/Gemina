 The goal of the present study was to further refine how polygenic risk scores may be used in a large population and to quantify the transmission of risk score through generations. Allele frequencies from the 1000 Genomes data for 159 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with breast cancer risk were used. A breast cancer risk score was calculated among 100,000 people. Choosing two `` parents '' and the alleles they transmit at random , 100,000 `` daughters '' were simulated. The population was divided by deciles of risk score. Comparing mean risk score in the mother and daughter populations provided information regarding the general relationship at a population level. By examining the distribution of daughter 's risk score within each decile of maternal risk score , the transmission was evaluated at the subject level. Mean values of risk score were 85.1 ( St Dev = 7.5) and 85.0 ( St Dev = 7.5) for the populations of mothers and daughters , respectively ( mean absolute difference = 0.02 , p = 0.48). When examining the transmission of risk score from mothers to daughters in specific deciles of risk , statistically significant differences were observed in all deciles ( ranged between 0.001 and < 2.2 Ã— 10 The relationship at the subject level will not provide information regarding prevention and screening of offspring based on the knowledge of parents ' risk score alone. The present results show that risk estimation by polygenic risk scores is personal , and evaluation of risk score is required for each individual.
