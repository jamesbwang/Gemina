 Malignancies consist not only of cancerous and nonmalignant cells , but also of additional elements , as extracellular matrix. The aim of this review is to summarize meta-analyses , describing breast tissue stiffness and risk of breast carcinoma ( BC) assessing the potential relationship between matricellular proteins ( MPs) and survival. A systematic computer-based search of published articles , according to PRISMA statement , was conducted through Ovid interface. Mammographic density and tissue stiffness are associated with the risk of BC development , suggesting that MPs may influence BC prognosis. No definitive conclusions are available and additional researches are required to definitively clarify the role of each MP , mammographic density and stiffness in BC development and the mechanisms involved in the onset of this malignancy.
