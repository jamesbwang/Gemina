 Lymphoid follicular proctitis<disease> ( LFP) is an uncommon inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> that is characterized by rectal bleeding , congested and granular mucosa without ulceration and abnormal and coalescing hyperplastic lymphoid follicles without acute<symptom> inflammatory changes. The lesions<symptom> are usually confined to the rectal mucosa. LFP therapy is not well defined. Herein , we present a case of LFP that was resolved with a rapid administration of mesalazine enemas. A 35-year-old male was admitted to our hospital due to intermittent rectal bleeding associated with stools<symptom>. Total colonoscopy revealed nodular mucosa with top pinpoint-like ulcers<disease><symptom> from the rectum to the border between the sigmoid flexure and the rectum. The nodules<symptom> congested together on the lower rectal segment and occupied 2/3 of the rectal lumina. Endoscopic submucosal dissection was performed in order to obtain more specimens for histologic examination , which revealed marked lymphoid follicular hyperplasia<disease> with prominent germinal centers and a conserved mantle zone. Treatment was started with mesalazine enemas of 4 g q.d. and the patient was asymptomatic after three days. All the lesions<symptom> disappeared two months later. Mesalazine enemas could be a promising and effective therapeutic option for LFP therapy.
