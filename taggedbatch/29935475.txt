 To identify the most accurate quantitative electroencephalographic ( qEEG) predictor ( s) of unfavorable post-ischemic stroke outcome , and its discriminative capacity compared to already known demographic , clinical and imaging prognostic markers. Prospective cohort of 151 consecutive anterior circulation ischemic stroke patients followed for 12 months. EEG was recorded within 72 h and at discharge or 7 days post-stroke. QEEG ( global band power , symmetry , affected/unaffected hemisphere and time changes) indices were calculated from mean Fast Fourier Transform and analyzed as predictors of unfavorable outcome ( mRS â‰¥ 3) , at discharge and 12 months poststroke , before and after adjustment for age , admission NIHSS and ASPECTS. Higher delta , lower alpha and beta relative powers ( RP) predicted outcome. Indices with higher discriminative capacity were delta-theta to alpha-beta ratio ( DTABR) and alpha RP. Outcome models including either of these and other clinical/imaging stroke outcome predictors were superior to models without qEEG data. In models with qEEG indices , infarct size was not a significant outcome predictor. DTAABR and alpha RP are the best qEEG indices and superior to ASPECTS in post-stroke outcome prediction. They improve the discriminative capacity of already known clinical and imaging stroke outcome predictors , both at discharge and 12 months after stroke. qEEG indices are independent predictors of stroke outcome.
