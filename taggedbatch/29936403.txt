 Hormone therapy ( HT) is an effective treatment for climacteric symptoms. Nevertheless , combined estrogen-progestin therapy and the oral route seem to entail higher risk of venous thromboembolism ( VTE) than estrogen-only therapy and transdermal administration. The present study aimed to investigate the risk of thromboembolic events in postmenopausal women using non-oral estrogen compared to women using oral estrogen and control groups ( women receiving placebo or non-users of HT) , as well as to assess the thrombotic impact of estrogens alone vs. combined estrogen-progestin therapy. Systematic review of MEDLINE , Cochrane CENTRAL , EMBASE , and ClinicalTrials.gov according to PRISMA guidelines. Twenty-two studies were included in the meta-analyses ( 9 case-control studies , 9 cohort studies , and 4 randomized controlled trials). As compared to control groups , VTE risk was not increased with non-oral HT , including users of estrogens and estrogens plus progestins ( OR 0.97 ( 0.9-1.06)) , non-oral estrogen therapy ( ET)- only ( OR 0.95 ( 0.81-1.10)) , and non-oral combined estrogen-progestin therapy ( OR 0.92 ( 0.77-1.09)). Conversely , increased risk of VTE was observed as compared with control groups in users of oral HT , including users of estrogens and estrogens plus progestins HT ( OR 1.72 ( 1.47-2.01)) , oral ET-only ( OR 1.43 ( 1.34-1.53)) , and combined oral estrogen-progestin HT ( OR 2.35 ( 1.9-2.9)). The comparison of non-oral vs. oral HT showed increased VTE risk with oral HT ( OR 1.66 ( 1.39-1.98)). VTE risk was increased in postmenopausal women with no previous thromboembolic events using oral HT. Non-oral HT did not significantly affect this risk. The quality of the evidence produced in our meta-analyses is low<symptom> to moderate , and further clinical trials are needed to sort out the impact of different types of progestin and different estrogen doses and administration routes on VTE risk.
