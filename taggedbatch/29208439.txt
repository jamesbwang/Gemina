 The treatment landscape has changed since the immune checkpoint inhibitors were approved in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). Although the promising clinical benefit from programmed death-1/ programmed death ligand-1 ( PD-1/ PD-L1) inhibitors was observed in the second or subsequent line treatment of patients who progressed on chemotherapy , it has a long way for single PD-1/ PD-L1 inhibitor to move forward to the frontline without a predictive biomarker. Tumor response is far from satisfactory without selection and primary or acquired resistance to PD-1/ PD-L1 inhibitors hampered their utility. Therefore , it is crucial to determine a strategy that can optimize the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors and increase the numbers of the responders. Multiple combination approaches based on PD-1/ PD-L1 inhibitors are designed and aimed to boost anti-tumor response and benefit a broader population. In this review , we will integrate the updated clinical data to highlight the four most promising combination strategies in advance NSCLC: combination of checkpoint inhibition with chemotherapy , anti-angiogenesis , immunotherapy and radiotherapy. We further discuss the issues needed to be addressed and perspectives in the context of `` combination era ''.
