 Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA ( ADARs) catalyze the deamination of adenosine ( A) to inosine ( I). A-to-I RNA editing targets double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA) , and increases the complexity of gene regulation by modulating base pairing-dependent processes such as splicing , translation , and microRNA ( miRNA)- mediated gene silencing. This study investigates the genome-wide binding preferences of the nuclear constitutive isoforms ADAR1-p110 and ADAR2 on human miRNA species by RNA immunoprecipitation of ADAR-bound small RNAs ( RIP-seq). Our results suggest that secondary structure predicted by base-pairing probability in the mainly double-stranded region of a pre-miRNA or mature miRNA duplex may determine ADAR isoform preference for binding distinct subpopulations of miRNAs. Furthermore , we identify 31 unique editing sites with statistical significance , 19 sites of which are novel editing sites. Editing sites are enriched in the seed region responsible for target recognition by miRNAs , and isoform-specific nucleotide motifs in the immediate vicinity and opposite of editing sites are consistent with previous studies , and further reveal that ADAR2 may edit A/C bulges more frequently than ADAR1-p110 in the context of miRNA.
