 Acute<pathogen><disease><symptom> severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding ( LGIB) can be treated by endoscopy safely and effectively. At present , the data on the efficacy of endoscopy in the treatment of patients with LGIB are still being collected. Thus , guidelines to manage patients with LGIB are still in development. Herein , based on the recent literature and their twenty year experience in their units in the US and in Japan , the authors summarize the role of endoscopic hemostasis therapy in acute<pathogen><disease><symptom> severe LGIB with a focus on how to perform the hemostasis techniques.
