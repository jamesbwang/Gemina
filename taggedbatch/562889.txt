 Acrylamide ( ACR) consumption is increasing all over the world. There are some evidence on the literature about its neurotoxic effect on mature animals , but the effects of ACR on postnatal development have been less studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of ACR on development of cortical layer , white matter , and number of Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in rat newborns. This study was carried out on 20 female Wistar rats ( average weight: 180 g , aged: two months). The rats were divided into four groups. Pregnant rats were orally fed with ACR 10 mg/kg and vitamin C 200 mg/kg. In this study , 6 infants of each group ( weighting 32-35 g) were randomly selected at day 21 after birth and placed under deep anesthesia and transcardial perfusion. Their cerebellums were fixed and histopathological changes were evaluated with Hematoxylin and Eosin ( H&E) staining and cresyl violet method. The volume of cerebellar cortical layers and number of Purkinje cells were investigated by Cavalieri 's principle and physical dissector methods. The obtained data were analyzed by 1-way ANOVA and LSD test using SPSS. P < 0.05 considered as statistically significant. The results showed that newborns of ACR-treated female rats have decreased cerebellar weight ( P ≤ 0.05) and lower than average number of Purkinje cells ( P ≤ 0.001). ACR also decreased the volume of granular and molecular layer and increased the volume of white matter. While the results showed decreased in white matter volume in vitamin C group ( P ≤ 0.001). ACR induces structural changes in the development of the cerebellar cortical layers in rat newborns , but these changes may be prevented by vitamin C as an antioxidant.
