 Ecologists have used Global Positioning Systems ( GPS) to track animals for 30 years. Issues today include logging frequency and precision in estimating space use and travel distances , as well as battery life and cost. We developed a low-cost ( ~ US$ 125) , open-source GPS datalogger based on Arduino. To test the system , we collected positions at 20-s intervals for several 1-week durations from cattle and sheep on rangeland in North Dakota. We tested two questions of broad interest to ecologists who use GPS collars to track animal movements: ( 1) How closely do collared animals cluster in their herd? ( 2) How well do different logging patterns estimate patch occupancy and total daily distance traveled? Tested logging patterns included regular logging ( one position every 5 or 10 min) , and burst logging ( positions recorded at 20-s intervals for 5 or 10 min per hour followed by a sleep period). Collared sheep within the same pasture spent 75 % of daytime periods within 51 m of each other ( mean = 42 m); collared cattle were within 111 m ( mean = 76 m). In our comparison of how well different logging patterns estimate space use versus constant logging , the proportion of positions recorded in 1- and 16-ha patches differed by 2 % -3 % for burst logging and 1 % for regular logging. Although all logging patterns underestimated total daily distance traveled , underestimations were corrected by multiplying estimations by regression coefficients estimated by maximum likelihood. Burst logging can extend battery life by a factor of 7. We conclude that a minimum of two collars programmed with burst logging robustly estimate patch use and spatial distribution of grazing livestock herds. Research questions that require accurately estimating travel of individual animals , however , are probably best addressed with regular logging intervals and will thus have greater battery demands than spatial occupancy questions across all GPS datalogger systems.
