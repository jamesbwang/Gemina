 The steep increase and inappropriateness of caesarean birth represent a healthcare problem in Iran. The purpose of study was to evaluate the effect of a campaign based on social marketing to promote normal childbirth. The study was designed as a prospective case control study. The social marketing campaign was implemented from March 2016 to January 2017. A demographic data questionnaire , obstetrical history questionnaire , maternal knowledge assessment questionnaire , and maternal health belief questionnaire comprised the instruments for this study. Only women planning a caesarean birth without any medical indications for the caesarean were enrolled in the study as a case. Those who met the same inclusion criteria and did not want to participate in the campaign were assigned to the control group. In total , 350 first-time pregnant women who composed the campaign group ( n = 194) and control group ( n = 156) completed the study. The mean baseline level of knowledge and Health Belief Model component score did not differ between the two groups at baseline. However , after the campaign , knowledge scores , perceived severity , perceived susceptibility , self-efficacy , and cues to action scores differed significantly between the campaign and control groups. The follow-up of all participants in both groups showed that 35.6 % ( n = 69) of participants in the campaign group chose natural birth as their birth method , whereas only 13.5 % ( n = 21) in the control group delivered their newborn vaginally. The B Butterfly social marketing campaign successfully targeted first-time pregnant women who chose to have unnecessary elective cesarean births.
