 Hereditary amyloidosis related to transthyretin V30M ( hATTR V30M) is a progressive length-dependent sensorimotor axonal neuropathy. We aimed to compare the disease progression of treated ( liver transplantation ( LT) or tafamidis) versus untreated patients with hATTR V30M. A total of 81 patients with hATTR V30M were included: 27 untreated , 25 treated with LT and 29 undergoing tafamidis treatment. Neuropathy was assessed at baseline , 12 , 24 and 36 months after study entry. We evaluated disease stage , modified polyneuropathy disability ( mPND) score and a composite neurophysiological score comprised of sensory and motor conduction parameters. The effect of treatment on disease progression was analysed using linear mixed-effects modelling. At baseline , patients from the untreated group were older ( P < 0.01) and those in the LT group had longer disease duration than those in the tafamidis group ( P < 0.05). Gender , mPND and motor scores at study entry were equal in the three groups; however , the untreated group had lower sensory scores compared with the tafamidis group ( P < 0.01). During the 3-year follow-up period , progression to stage II of the disease was seen only in the untreated group. The progression on mPND , sensory and motor scores was significantly higher in the untreated patients. When treated groups were compared , the LT group had lower rates of composite neurophysiological score progression. However , the sensory score outcome was similar between tafamidis responders and LT patients. Both LT and tafamidis therapy modified the natural history of hATTR V30M by reducing neuropathy progression.
