 Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD) deficiency is a common enzyme deficiency affecting more than 300 million individuals worldwide. Extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia , with its severe sequelae of bilirubin neurotoxicity and the potential of death , is the most devastating manifestation of G6PD deficiency. In a recent review of Favism , Luzzatto and Arese state that the pathophysiology of jaundice in G6PD-deficient neonates is different from that of favism , as there is little evidence of hemolysis<symptom> in these infants. To explore the role of hemolysis<symptom> in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia associated with G6PD deficiency. Previously published works including studies of endogenous production of carbon monoxide ( CO) , an index of heme catabolism , in hyperbilirubinemic G6PD-deficient neonates were reviewed to determine the role of hemolysis<symptom> in this condition. Three studies demonstrated that endogenous CO production is elevated in G6PD-deficient neonates with extreme hyperbilirubinemia. Hemolysis<symptom> is an important pathogenetic factor in G6PD deficiency-associated neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.
