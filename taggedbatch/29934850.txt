 A variant of the hybridization oligonucleotide microarray , utilizing the principle of many probes-one spot ( MPOS-microarrays) , is proposed. A case study based on Orthopoxviruses ( Variola<pathogen><disease> , Monkeypox<pathogen> , and Ectromelia viruses) demonstrates a considerable increase in the fluorescence signal ( up to 100-fold) when several oligonucleotide probes are printed to one spot. Moreover , the specificity of detection also increases ( almost 1000-fold) , allowing the use of probes that individually lack such high specificity. The optimal probes have a Tm of 32-37 °C and length of 13-15 bases. We suggest that the high specificity and sensitivity of the MPOS-microarray is a result of cooperativity of DNA binding with all probes immobilized in the spot. This variant of DNA detection can be useful for designing biosensors , tools for point-of-care ( POC) diagnostics , microbial ecology , analysis of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR) , and others.
