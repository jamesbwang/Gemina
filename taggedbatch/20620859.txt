 Echocardiography represents the most commonly performed noninvasive cardiac imaging test for patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF). The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between exercise capacity parameters ( peak oxygen consumption ( VO2) and the minute ventilation-carbon dioxide production relationship ( VE/VCO2)) , two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography ( 2D-STE) and three-dimensional echocardiography ( 3DE) imaging of right ventricular ( RV) function in HF patients with reduced ejection fraction ( EF). This cross-sectional study included 54 patients with diagnosed ischemic LV systolic dysfunction ( HF with reduced EF < 40 %) divided in subgroups based on the proposed values of the analyzed cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET) variables: VO2 peak ≤ 15 ml/kg/min , VO2 peak > 15 ml/kg/min , VE/VCO2 slope < 36 and VE/VCO2 slope ≥ 36. All patients underwent a physical examination , laboratory testing , conventional echocardiography , 2D-STE , 3DE , and CPET. RV fractional area change ( FAC) , 2D RV global longitudinal strain ( GLS) , 3D RV EF were significantly decreased , and RV basal diameter ( BD) , systolic pulmonary artery pressure ( SPAP) , tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion ( TAPSE) , ratio between tricuspid flow and tissue Doppler derived e ' of the lateral tricuspid annulus ( TV E/e ') were significantly increased in the subgroups of subjects with a worse VO2 peak and VE/VCO2 slope values. There was a significant positive correlation between the peak VO2 values and TAPSE , 2D RV GLS , 3D RV SV , and 3D RV EF as well as a significantly inverse correlation with VE/VCO2 slope. The observed significant correlation between the examined parameters suggests that 2D RV GLS and 3D RV EF , SV are associated with exercise capacity in patients with reduced HF.
