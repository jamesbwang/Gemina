 In this Letter , the ` Open chromatin ' label in Fig. 4a should have been centred above the first three columns , and the black horizontal line underneath the label should have been removed. In addition , there should have been a vertical black line between the last two sets of panels for consistency. Minor changes have also been made to Fig. 1 and to the legend of Fig. 3. These errrors have been corrected online , and see Supplementary Information to the accompanying Amendment for the original Fig. 4.
