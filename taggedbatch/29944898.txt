 Bombyx mori bidensovirus ( BmBDV) causes fatal ﬂacherie disease leading to severe economic losses in sericultures. The BmDNV-Z genome contains two single-stranded DNA molecules , VD1 and VD2. For generating silkworm lines with antiviral properties , two transgenic RNA interference ( RNAi) vectors were constructed. Open reading frames ( ORFs) 1-4 of VD1 were knockdown by vector pb-BDV1 while ORF1a , ORF1b , and ORF3 of VD2 were knockdown by vector pb-BDV2. Transgenic silkworm lines BDV1-I and BDV2-I were generated via RNAi microinjection. Mortality rates of BDV1-I and BDV2-I were reduced by 45 % and 39 % , respectively , and quantitative PCR showed that VD1 and VD2 contents in BDV1-I and BDV2-I were signiﬁcantly lower than in the non-transgenic line. However , economic traits showed no obvious differences. Thus , knockdown of multiple BmDNV-Z genes provides strong resistance to BDV1-I and BDV2-I lines , and these can be used in sericulture without hampering silk production.
