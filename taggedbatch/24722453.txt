 Breast cancer is a complex<disease> disease<disease> exhibiting extensive inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. Inflammation<symptom> is a well-known driver of cancer progression , often attributed to immune cells infiltrating the tumor stroma. However , tumor cells themselves are capable to secrete a variety of inflammatory molecules , of which we understand very little about their role in intra-clonal communication. We recently reported the capacity of triple negative cell lines to induce a cancer stem cell ( CSC)- like phenotype and invasion properties into luminal cells , a mechanism mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines that up-regulated the CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 chemokine signaling axis. We performed transcriptional array analyses of CSCs-associated genes and cancer-inflammatory cell crosstalk genes and built regulatory networks with the data collected. We found a specific molecular signature segregating with the induced-invasive/stemness phenotype. Regulatory network analysis pointed out to an NFκB transcriptional signature , active in aggressive triple negative cells and in induced-invasive/CSC-like luminal cells. In agreement , NFκB inhibition abolished the induction of the stemness/invasive features. These data support an NFκB dependent mechanism of intra-clonal communication responsible for tumor cell plasticity leading the acquisition of cancer aggressive features. Understanding the communication between different tumor clones would help to find better therapeutic and prophylactic targets to prevent BrC progression and relapse.
