 Therapeutic interventions that improve glucose homeostasis such as attenuation of glucagon receptor ( Gcgr) signaling and bariatric surgery share common metabolic features conserved in mice and humans. These include increased circulating levels of bile acids ( BA) and the proglucagon-derived peptides ( PGDPs) , GLP-1 and GLP-2. Whether BA acting through TGR5 ( Gpbar1) increases PGDP levels in these scenarios has not been examined. Furthermore , although the importance of GLP-1 action has been interrogated in Gcgr To assess whether BA acting through Gpbar1 mediates improved glucose homeostasis in Gcgr Circulating levels of BA were markedly elevated yet similar in Gcgr These findings reveal that GLP-2R controls BA levels and relative proportions of BA species in Gcgr
