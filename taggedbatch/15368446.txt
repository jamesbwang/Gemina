 Cholestatic patients exhibiting high bile acid serum levels were reported to be more susceptible to bacterial and viral<disease> infections<disease>. Animal studies in bile duct ligated ( BDL) mice suggest that cholestasis leads to an aggravation of hepatic bacterial infections. We have investigated the impact of cholestasis on mouse cytomegalovirus ( MCMV)- induced immune responses and viral replication. While MCMV did not aggravate BDL-induced liver damage , BDL markedly reduced MCMV-triggered chemokine expression and immune cell recruitment to the liver. MCMV-infected BDL mice showed diminished trafficking of Ly6C +/ F4/80 + myeloid cells and NK1 .1 + NK cells to the liver compared to MCMV infected control mice. Moreover , virus-driven expression of CCL7 , CCL12 , CXCL9 and CXCL10 was clearly impaired in BDL- compared to sham-operated mice. Furthermore , production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was massively augmented in infected BDL mice. In contrast , intra- and extrahepatic virus replication was unaltered in BDL-MCMV mice when compared to sham-MCMV mice. Cholestasis in the BDL model severely impaired pathogen-induced chemokine expression in the liver affecting CCR2- and CXCR3-dependent cell trafficking. Cholestasis resulted in reduced recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and NK cells to the liver.
