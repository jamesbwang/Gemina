 Few data are available regarding ipragliflozin treatment in combination with glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1) receptor agonists. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists in Japanese patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM). This multicenter study ( consisting of three periods: a 4-week washout period , a 6-week observation period , and a 52-week open-label treatment period) included patients aged ≥ 20 years who received a stable dose/regimen of a GLP-1 receptor agonist either solely or in combination therapy with a sulfonylurea for ≥ 6 weeks , with glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c) of ≥ 7.5 % and a fasting plasma glucose ( FPG) of ≥ 126 mg/dL. Ipragliflozin treatment was given at a fixed dose of 50 mg/day for 20 weeks , followed by 50 or 100 mg/day for 32 weeks. Changes from baseline in glycemic control and other parameters were examined; safety was also assessed. The mean changes in HbA1c and body<symptom> weight from baseline to end of treatment were- 0.92 % and- 2.69 kg , respectively , in all ipragliflozin-treated patients ( n = 103). Overall , sustained reductions from baseline were observed for HbA1c , FPG , self-monitored blood glucose , and body<symptom> weight during the 52-week treatment. The dose increase of ipragliflozin to 100 mg/day resulted in better glycemic control and weight reduction for patients in whom the 50-mg dose was insufficient. Overall , 46.6 % ( 48/103) of patients experienced drug-related adverse events. The most common drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events were pollakiuria ( 9.7 %) , hypoglycemia ( 8.7 %) , constipation<symptom> ( 6.8 %) , and thirst ( 5.8 %). Combined therapy with ipragliflozin and GLP-1 receptor agonists/sulfonylureas was significantly efficacious in reducing glycemic parameters in patients with T2DM with inadequate glycemic control , and no major safety concerns were identified. The results from this study suggest that ipragliflozin can be recommended as a well-tolerated and effective add-on therapy to a GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of T2DM.
