 The authors intended to investigate if 28-mm cryoballoon ( CB) ablation also modifies the 4 major atrial ganglionaated plexi ( GP). The major atrial GP facilitate the initiation and maintenance of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF). The 28-mm CB covers a large surface area of the left atrium and probably the GP areas. High-frequency stimulation ( 20 Hz) was delivered to the area of anterior right GP ( ARGP) , inferior right GP , superior left ( SLGP) , and inferior left GP ( ILGP). Positive GP sites were defined as a prolongation of R-wave to R-wave ( RR) interval during AF by > 50 %. The area of each GP before and after CB ablation was compared. A total of 18 patients with paroxysmal AF who underwent CB and radiofrequency ablation and had positive GP sites were reviewed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess the effects of CB ablation on each GP. There was a statistically significant difference in the area of all 4 GP after CB ablation: 1) ARGP area: 2.9 cm The surface area of all 4 of the major atrial GP was substantially reduced by CB ablation. The SLGP and ARGP had the largest , whereas the ILGP had the least percent of reduction following CB ablation. Part of the therapeutic effects of CB ablation may result from modifying the 4 major atrial GP.
