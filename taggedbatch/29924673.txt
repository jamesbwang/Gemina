 Nonspecific low<symptom> back pain ( LBP) can progress to chronic disability and prolonged absence from work. Despite clinical and professional guidelines , physiotherapists often fail to address return to work outcomes. The aim of this exploratory study was to determine whether an e-learning resource tailored to physiotherapy practice could affect physiotherapists ' attitudes and beliefs regarding return to work advice for their patients. A prospective interventional cohort study ( pilot). Participants were recruited via the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy website. Responses on a clinical vignette , the Health Care Providers ' Pain and Impairment Scale ( HC-Pairs) , and the Behavioral Constructs Questionnaire ( BCQ) were collected online at baseline ( Q1) and 2-months post-intervention ( Q2). Fifty-four physiotherapists completed Q1 and the response rate for Q2 was 44/54 ( 81 %). Changes in the degree of agreement with guidelines indicated that the intervention made an impact on respondents ( kappa 0.345; p = 0.003). HC-Pairs and BCQ results showed a nonstatistically significant trend toward the target behavior. There is a need for interventions to improve adherence with advice for return to work following nonspecific LBP. An e-learning tool for physiotherapists on advising patients regarding return to work has potential to positively affect self-reported clinical behavior.
