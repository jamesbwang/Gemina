 Outcomes involving newer direct-acting antiviral ( DAA) hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) regimens have not been studied extensively among the Medicaid population. To assess clinical ( treatment failure) and economic outcomes for chronic HCV-infected Oklahoma Medicaid members following treatment with DAAs and to measure associations with patient , treatment , and clinical characteristics. This cross-sectional study used Oklahoma Medicaid pharmacy and medical claims data for adult members who used a newer DAA agent and had reported a successful or failed sustained virological response rate 12 weeks after therapy completion ( SVR12) from January 1 , 2014 , to June 30 , 2016. Multivariable logistic and gamma regressions assessed predictors of SVR12 failure and costs controlling for member demographics ( i.e. , age , sex , race , rural residence); type of DAA and adherence; clinical characteristics ( e.g. , comorbid conditions , advanced liver disease); and the implementation of changes to a prior authorization program. Of 934 Medicaid members eligible for treatment with DAAs between January 1 , 2014 , and June 30 , 2016 , 906 received DAA treatment , 40.6 % ( 368/906) had reported SVR12 outcomes , and 59.4 % ( n = 538) did not have a reported SVR recorded. Of those with reported SVR12 outcomes , patients were 53.1 ± 9.7 years of age , 51.1 % were male , 8.4 % had SVR12 failure , and each member had mean costs of $ 140,283 ± $ 52,779. Multivariable analyses indicated higher odds of SVR12 failure was independently associated with cirrhosis ( OR ( decompensated) = 6.69 and OR ( compensated) = 3.52 , P < 0.001) , while males had higher odds of failure than females ( OR = 3.34 , P < 0.010). No significant difference in SVR12 failure was noted , according to DAA type or a medication adherence threshold of > 95 %. Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was independently associated with lower costs ( exp ( b) = 0.81; P < 0.001) compared with sofosbuvir , while higher costs were associated with decompensated cirrhosis ( exp ( b) = 1.22; P < 0.001) and treatment failure ( exp ( b) = 1.18 , P < 0.010). In an analysis including members without reported SVR12 outcomes , decompensated and compensated cirrhosis had lower odds ( P < 0.001) of no reported SVR12 from ambulatory clinic settings. Almost 60 % of Medicaid members receiving DAA treatment did not have a final reported SVR12 outcome. Among those with viral load measurements , treatment success was high and both decompensated and compensated cirrhosis were independently associated with significantly higher odds of treatment failure. Addressing a loss to follow-up among HCV<pathogen> patients and curtailing the development of cirrhosis to improve treatment success may warrant interventions that improve access to care and remove barriers that impede treatment initiation and completion.
