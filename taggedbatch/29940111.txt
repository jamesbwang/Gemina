 Exact exchange is an important constituent in many state-of-the-art approximations to the exchange-correlation ( xc) functional of Kohn-Sham DFT. However , its evaluation can be computationally intensive , which can be particularly prohibitive in DFT-based molecular dynamics ( MD) simulations , often restricted to semilocal functionals. We derive a scheme based on the formal coordinate scaling properties of the exact xc functional that allows for a substantial reduction of the cost of the evaluation of both the exact exchange energy and potential. We show that within a plane-wave/pseudopotential framework , excellent accuracy is retained , while speed ups from up to âˆ¼ 6 can be reached. The coordinate scaling thus accelerates hybrid-functional-based first-principles MD simulations by nearly one order of magnitude.
