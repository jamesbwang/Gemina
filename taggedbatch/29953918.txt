 Serum folate is important in clinical researches and DNA synthesis and methylation. Some loci and genes that are associated with folate levels had been detected by genome-wide association studies ( GWAS) , such as rs1801133 in MTHFR and rs1979277 in SHMT1. Nevertheless , only a small part of variants has been clearly identified for serum folate. Hence , we conducted a GWAS to discover new inherited susceptibility and gene-environment interactions on serum folate concentration. In a healthy Chinese population of 1999 men , genotyping was performed using Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip. Serum folate levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) , pathway enrichment analysis and statistical analysis were performed by Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery ( DAVID) and Statistic Package for Social Science ( SPSS). We validated that rs1801133 in MTHFR was significantly involved in serum folate ( P = 4.21 Ã— 10 In a male Chinese population , genome-wide association study discovered that three novel SNPs rs3782886 , rs671 and rs4646776 of ALDH2 gene were suggestively significantly associated with serum folate levels.
