 This paper aims to analyse whether time spent in sedentary behaviour was a discriminant criterion for frailty in older adults. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in a sample of 457 elderly individuals aged & ge; 60 years. Frailty was defined as the presence of three or more of the following criteria: Unintentional weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , low walking speed at a 4.57 m course , reduced manual grip strength , exhaustion<symptom> and insufficient physical activity level. Participants were classified into two groups: Non-frail or frail. Exposure to sedentary behaviour was assessed by the time spent sitting during a typical week , according to the adapted version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Descriptive ( mean , frequency) and inferential statistics ( Poisson regression , Pearson & rsquo; s Chi-square , Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) were used to analyse the data , comparing them to the time-related areas exposed to sedentary behaviour by gender and the presence of fragility. The prevalence of frailty was 22.1 % (
