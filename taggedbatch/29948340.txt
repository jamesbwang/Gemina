 The American Men 's Internet Survey ( AMIS) is conducted annually with 10,000 men age 15 + who have sex with men ( MSM). Modeling was used with 39,863 AMIS surveys from 4 cycles between December 2013 to February 2017 to identify temporal trends in sexual behavior , substance use , and testing behavior ( within 12 months preceding interview) stratified by participants ' self-reported HIV<pathogen> status. HIV-negative/unknown status MSM had significant increases in condomless anal intercourse ( CAI) , marijuana use , use of other illicit substances , sexually transmitted infection ( STI) diagnoses , and HIV<pathogen> or STI testing ( testing only increased among MSM age 25 +). HIV-negative/unknown status MSM had significant decrease in CAI with an HIV-positive or unknown status partner. HIV-positive MSM had significant increases in CAI , methamphetamine use , and STI diagnoses/testing. Although encouraging , the few indicators of improvement in HIV/STI sexual health practices are not consistently seen across sub-groups of MSM and may be counteracted by growing proportions of MSM engaging in CAI and acquiring STIs.
