 Many consumers use the term `` gu-soo '' to describe the flavor characteristics of traditional Doenjang ( fermented soybean paste). The objective of this study was twofold: 1) to define the sensory modality associated with the perception of gu-soo in Doenjang , and 2) to correlate instrumental data on when the term gu-soo is used for describing sensory characteristics of Doenjang. To achieve these objectives , using five Doenjang samples , we conducted consumer sensory analysis with limited sensory modalities as well as instrumental flavor and color analyses. Three volatile compounds were identified as showing high correlation to consumer perception of gu-soo for Doenjang: 1-hexanol , benzene ethanol , benzene , and 2-methyl furan. The results from the current study suggest that consumer perception of gu-soo in Doenjang is not solely an olfactory-related perception , suggesting that visual stimuli , including a darker paste color and an apparent high number of beans in the paste , are highly related to the consumer perception of gu-soo in Doenjang , followed by olfactory related terms , and taste-related stimuli.
