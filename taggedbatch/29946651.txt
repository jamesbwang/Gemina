 To investigate the clinical effect of concentrated growth factor ( CGF) in oral cavity repair. From February 2013 to February 2016 in our hospital , 60 patients with insufficient bone underwent dental implantation. CGF was used alone in 27 patients ( CGF group) , CGF was used with autologous bone or bone material in 33 patients ( CGF mixed group). Bone repair was observed and evaluated. SPSS19 .0 software package was used for statistical analysis. Wound<disease><symptom> healing time in CGF group and CGF mixed group ( 8.43 ± 0.72) d<pathogen> and ( 8.04 ± 0.98) d<pathogen> , wound<disease><symptom> healing rate was 92.60 % in CGF group and 90.91 % in CGF group , the difference was not statistically significant ( P > 0.05); Implant success rate in CGF group and CGF mixed group was 92.31 % and 96.36 % , respectively. The difference was not statistically significant ( P > 0.05). CGF has good effect in repair of bone defect , and the long-term effect is stable. It is a simple and safe material for bone regeneration.
