 Compared to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy , immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown a significant efficacy in the treatment of lung cancer. Although interstitial lung disease ( ILD) is an important adverse event in immunotherapy , risk factors for ILD remain unclear. In this multicenter cohort study ( UMIN000025908) , 201 patients who were treated with nivolumab were retrospectively reviewed. Associations between the incidence of ILD and patient characteristics were evaluated. ILD grade and progression-free survival were analyzed according to the presence or absence of imaging findings of airway obstruction adjacent to lung tumors ( IAOT). In the multivariate analysis , the odds ratio ( OR) of ILD for patients with a history of radiation pneumonitis<disease><symptom> or IAOT was 3.96 ( p = 0.012) and 6.59 ( p = 0.004) , respectively. ILD occurred in six ( 37.5 %) out of 16 patients with IAOT and 19 ( 10.3 %) out of 185 patients without IAOT. Three out of the six patients with ILD and IAOT had ILD of grade 4 or more. The median progression-free survival of patients with and without IAOT was 0.9 and 3.2 months , respectively ( p < 0.001). IAOT was strongly associated with the occurrence of ILD after therapy with nivolumab.
