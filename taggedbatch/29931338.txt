 Fulminant hepatic failure secondary to herpes<disease> simplex<pathogen><disease> virus ( HSV) is a rare complication that is associated with high mortality. Here , we describe the case of a critically ill patient with severe burns and inhalation injury who developed severe coagulopathy during her hospital stay , which was later found to be caused by HSV hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom>. In addition , we review the current literature on HSV hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom>. Only three prior reports document liver involvement of HSV in patients with burn. Clinical symptoms , diagnostic factors , and management of HSV hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> in patients with burn are presented. Because of severe immunosuppression and potentially fatal nature of this infection , clinicians should have a heightened suspicion for HSV hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> in burn patients with HSV mucocutaneous involvement , unexplained liver dysfunction , and severe coagulopathy , and it should prompt immediate initiation of intravenous acyclovir.
