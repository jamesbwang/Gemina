 Non-coding RNAs ( ncRNAs) have significant regulatory functions on the regulation of gene expression of various life activities after transcription , even though they do not encode proteins. During the development of embryos , ncRNAs , such as long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) , microRNAs ( miRNAs) , circular RNAs ( circRNAs) , small nucleolar RNAs ( snoRNAs) , and Piwi-interacting RNAs ( piRNAs) , have been widely proven as key regulators. The emerging single-cell RNA sequencing technique is powerful for profiling `` cell-to-cell '' variability at the genomic level. It has been applied to detect the expression of ncRNAs during embryo development. In this chapter , we pay close attention to single-cell ncRNA expression and summarize their roles in embryo development.
