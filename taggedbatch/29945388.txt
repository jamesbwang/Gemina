 Pu-erh tea is a unique post-fermented tea processed from tender leaves of Camellia assamica. Characteristic component puerins were produced during the microbial fermentation process.This study focuses on the therapeutic effect and mechanism of puerinⅠ ( P1) in Pu-erh tea on ApoE-/- mice with dyslipidemia and diabetes. It was found that P1 could significantly decreased total cholesterol ( TC) , triglyceride ( TG) and fast blood glucose ( FBG) , and markedly improved impaired glucose tolerance ( IPGTT) and insulin sensitivity ( ITT) in hyperlipidemic and hyperglycemic ApoE-/- mice. Further experiments proved that P1 reduced FBG and plasma TG levels by inhibiting intestinal α-glycosidase enzymes activity and by activating low-density lipoprotein receptor respectively. This study confirmed the therapeutic effect and mechanism of P1 on ApoE-/- mice with diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Based on the good efficacy of this compound , P1 could be used as a new drug to treat the disorder of glycolipid metabolism.
