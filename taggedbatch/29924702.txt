 Household waste has evolved into a core urban challenge , with increased quantities of waste being generated and with more complex material compositions , often containing toxic and hazardous elements. Critical systems theory understands cities as urban metabolisms , with different material and energy flows , highlighting the circularity in production , consumption , and discard. Waste pickers in low- and medium-income countries work on dumps and landfills , sifting through highly contaminated household waste and are exposed to health hazards. This paper discusses the risk factors , hazards , and vulnerabilities waste pickers are exposed to during collection and separation of recyclables , based on the review of literature on waste and environmental health and on findings from participatory research with waste pickers conducted in Brazil. We take a social and environmental justice perspective and identify the vulnerabilities and waste-borne hazards of household waste , associated with these workers , their communities , watersheds , and the environment. Household waste , although not always per se toxic or hazardous , can become a hazard if not collected or inadequately managed. Those communities where household waste is not collected or waste collection is insufficient are the most critical places. Informal and organized waste pickers , municipal or private waste collectors/workers , small waste traders and sometimes residents , particularly small children , may be considered vulnerable if exposed to waste-borne hazards. The results include recommendations to address household waste-borne hazards and vulnerabilities , according to waste workers involved in this research.
