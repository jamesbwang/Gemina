J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-This study determined the running demands of men 's field hockey with regards to the revised four-quarter match format. Twenty-eight male field hockey players were equipped with global positioning system units while competing in 14 competitive international games over a 1-year period. All matches allowed for unlimited substitutions , and consisted of four 15-minute quarters ( i.e. , Q1-Q4). A progressive decline in total distance ( TD) was observed in Q2 ( 2,072 ± 141 m) to Q4 ( 2,055 ± 212 m) compared with Q1 ( 2,171 ± 195 m , p < 0.05). However , the decline in TD was due to decreases in low-intensity activity ( < 15 km · h , p < 0.05) , as high-intensity running ( HIR; > 15 km · h) distances were similar throughout Q1-Q4 ( p = 0.263). Positional data demonstrated a similar profile , where significant decreases in TD , but not in HIR , was observed across all playing positions at some point over the 4 quarters ( p < 0.05). DEF accumulated the lowest amount of TD ( 7,631 ± 753 m) , HIR ( 2,257 ± 498 m) , and high-intensity decelerations ( 60 ± 9 , > -2 m · s) compared with MID and FWD ( p < 0.05). By contrast , FWD performed the highest amount of HIR ( 3,090 ± 565 m) and high-intensity accelerations ( 110 ± 9 , > 2 m · s) compared with MID and DEF ( p < 0.05). In conclusion , our results showed that although there was a progressive decline in TD over the 4 quarters of match play , high-intensity running performance ( i.e. , HIR and high-intensity acceleration) was maintained throughout the match regardless of playing position.
