 Dynamic functional connectivity metrics have much to offer to the neuroscience of individual differences of cognition. Yet , despite the recent expansion in dynamic connectivity research , limited resources have been devoted to the study of the reliability of these connectivity measures. To address this , resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 100 Human Connectome Project subjects were compared across 2 scan days. Brain states ( i.e. , patterns of coactivity across regions) were identified by classifying each time frame using k means clustering. This was done with and without global signal regression ( GSR). Multiple gauges of reliability indicated consistency in the brain-state properties across days and GSR attenuated the reliability of the brain states. Changes in the brain-state properties across the course of the scan were investigated as well. The results demonstrate that summary metrics describing the clustering of individual time frames have adequate test/retest reliability , and thus , these patterns of brain activation may hold promise for individual-difference research.
