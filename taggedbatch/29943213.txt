 Severity of plant diseases is often influenced by the availability of nutrients , particularly N; however , its effect on the phyllosphere microbiome in foliar pathogen challenged plants is less investigated in rice. The tripartite interaction among the fungal pathogen ( Magnaporthe oryzae<pathogen>) , rice cultivars ( basmati and non-basmati , blast resistant or susceptible) and nitrogen ( N) fertilization ( 0 , 120 and 180 N) was investigated. Plant growth , elicitation of defense responses and abundance of microbial members in the rice phyllosphere were monitored using biochemical and molecular methods. In general , photosynthetic pigments were distinct for each cultivar , and optimal N doses led to higher values. The susceptible var. CO-39 and resistant CO-39I exhibited higher contents of photosynthetic pigments and micronutrients such as zinc in leaves in response to N doses. Elicitation of defense and hydrolytic enzymes was significantly influenced by pathogen inoculation and modulated by N doses , but varietal effects were distinct. Scoring indices emphasized the pathogen susceptibility of var. CO-39 and PB-1 , which showed almost 40-60 % higher values than the resistant cultivars; the interactions of cultivars and N doses was also significant. Characteristic changes were recorded in the abundances of the gene copies , particularly , with an overall increase in the number of cyanobacterial 16S rRNA , and bacterial amoA in pathogen-challenged treatments , while nifH gene copies exhibited a reducing trend with increasing N doses , in the presence or absence of pathogen. The varietal differences in the cause and effect relationships can be valuable in crop protection for more effective foliar application of pesticides or biocontrol agents.
