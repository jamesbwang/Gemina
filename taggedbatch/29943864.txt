 Lewis acids play a major role in all areas of chemistry. For a long time , toxic , corrosive and oxidizing SbF ₅ was considered as the strongest Lewis acid known. Lately , species significantly exceeding the Lewis acidity of SbF ₅ have been realized and were termed Lewis superacids ( LSA). Prospective new candidates emerge steadily , which not only outperform SbF ₅ by their strength , but also by their accessibility and ease of handling. In principle , Lewis superacids allow to combine the outstanding activity of Bronsted superacids with the excellent selectivity of a common Lewis acid. However , the broad application of Lewis superacids in synthesis is all but popular. The present review deals with strong Lewis acids. First , it critically discusses Lewis acidity scaling methods and suggests an extended definition for Lewis superacidity. It then summarizes the properties and applications of the strongest currently known Lewis acids , indexed by the fluoride ion affinity ( FIA). The supporting information contains a comprehensive list of experimentally and theoretically derived FIA data as a guide for the choice of Lewis acidic reagents/catalyst. This contribution shall encourage the search for new Lewis superacids and promote their application in non-specialized laboratories.
