 Understanding the role of specific amino acid residues in the molecular mechanism of a protein 's function is one of the most challenging problems in modern biology. A systematic bioinformatic analysis of protein families and superfamilies can help in the study of structure-function relationships and in the design of improved variants of enzymes/proteins , but represents a methodological challenge. The pyridoxal-5 '- phosphate ( PLP)- dependent enzymes are catalytically diverse and include the aspartate aminotransferase superfamily which implements a common structural framework known as type fold I. In this work , the recently developed bioinformatic online methods Mustguseal and Zebra were used to collect and study a large representative set of the aspartate aminotransferase superfamily with high structural , but low sequence similarity to l-threonine aldolase from
