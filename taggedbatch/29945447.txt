 Scheelite-structure tungstates with unique structural features and excellent luminescence possess promising applications , such as light-emitting diodes ( LEDs) , scintillators , and displays. The controllable growth of high quality and uniform composition thin films mounted on cheap substrates is a key factor to realize the above commercial applications , however , which is also a big challenge due to the difficult stress release stemming from intrinsic lattice mismatches. Here , we employed the simple and composition-controlled polymer-assisted deposition ( PAD) method to successfully obtain a series of high quality and well-proportioned BaWO
