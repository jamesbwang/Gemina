 Spontaneous wrinkling of a polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS) surface was induced by repeated thermal shrinkage of liquid PDMS coated onto a cured PDMS layer. We investigated and evaluated the potential of the resulting surface as a cell culture substrate by monitoring the viability , spreading area , and proliferation rate of MG-63 cells cultured on native , wrinkled , and poly-L-lysine ( PLL)- coated PDMS surfaces. Cells seeded on the wrinkled and PLL-coated PDMS surfaces spread and adhered better than those on native surfaces. The numbers of attached cells growing on wrinkled and PLL-coated PDMS surfaces were higher than those of cells on a native PDMS surface. The spreading area of cells on the wrinkled surface was similar to that of cells on the PLL-coated surface , and was much larger than that on native PDMS. The proliferation rate of cells on the wrinkled surface was more than double that of cells on native PDMS. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) analysis of integrin mRNA expression showed that cells on the wrinkled surface were more tightly attached due to higher expression of the protein than exhibited in cells on native PDMS. Thus , the novel findings of this study are that the induction of a wrinkled PDMS surface through a simple curing process produces a suitable cell culture substrate without need of surface modification , and that its effectiveness is comparable to that of a PLL-coated PDMS surface.
