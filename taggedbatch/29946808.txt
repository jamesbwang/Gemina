 This study investigated the trend and associated factors of condom use among male clients of female sex workers ( CFSW) in Hong Kong. A total of 25,443 males of the general population were screened to identify 2,330 CFSW via 13 rounds of population-based serial cross-sectional telephone surveys during 1998 through 2015. Over time , there were no significant changes in condom use with various types of female sex partners ( p ranged 0. 219-0.837) and prevalence of self-reported STI ( p = 0.975) in the past 6 months. Decrease in the prevalence of non-regular sex partners ( p < 0.001) and increase in perceived efficacy of condom use for HIV<pathogen> prevention ( p = 0.028) were observed. Perceived efficacy of condom use for HIV<pathogen> prevention and self-reported STI experience were significantly associated with condom use with various types of female sex partners in the past 6 months. No evident improvement for condom use was found. Tailored intervention programs are warranted.
