 Hydropericardium hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> syndrome<disease><symptom> ( HHS) is a lethal disease caused by Fowl adenovirus<pathogen> serotype 4 ( FAdV-4) that mainly infects 3- to 6-week-old broiler chicks. In 2015 , an infectious<disease> disease<disease> characterized similar symptom to HHS in broilers outbroke in commercial duck flocks in Shandong province. FAdV-4 was isolated from naturally infected ducks and determined by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) amplification and DNA sequence analysis. In order to investigate the effect of FAdV-4 infection on muscovy ducks , we determined and characterized the FAdV-4 Isolate , and assessed its pathogenicity. In this study , HHS was respectively reproduced in 5-week-old muscovy duck by intramuscular injection and intranasal inoculation of allantoic fluid containing FAdV-4 , ducks in the negative control group were inoculated with allantoic fluids of healthy duck embryos in the same manner. Clinical symptoms , gross and microscopic lesions<symptom> , cytokines and antibodies , blood biochemical indices were detected and recorded for 12 days after infection. Typical hydropericardium and hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> was observed in experimental muscovy duck in the 3rd day post-inoculation ( dpi). FAdV-4 can be replicated in tissues and cause pathological damage , especially in the liver and immune organs. Most of the immune-related cytokines and antibodies levels are up-regulated and then decreased , which may be caused by the initial infection and the normal immune response , later the virus caused the immunosuppression and led to the decrease of levels. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first systematic trial of the pathogenicity of FAdV-4 in muscovy ducks mainly based on the serological test , which will provide new insights into the study of the disease.
