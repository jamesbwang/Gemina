 Intestinal opportunistic infections are often caused by unicellular parasites. Individuals with decreased immunity are particularly susceptible to infection by said microorganisms , and when they are infected , diarrhea<disease><symptom> can be the main clinical manifestation. However , intestinal parasites have rarely been taken into account in intestinal disorders. In our study , an investigation was conducted to determine the prevalence of intestinal micro-pathogens , such as Cryptosporidium , Giardia , Blastocystis , and microsporidia<pathogen> , in hospitalized patients with different immunological statuses. The study at hand indicates that protozoan parasitic infections are rare among immunodeficient patients in Poland. The overall prevalence of micro-pathogens among participants was 4.6 %; it was three times higher in adults ( 12.5 %) than in children ( 2.3 %). Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora species ( Apicomplexa) were diagnosed as the main cause of heavy diarrhea<disease><symptom>. Accordingly , adult patients were positive mainly for Blastocystis and microsporidia<pathogen> , while children were more often infected with the Cryptosporidium species.
