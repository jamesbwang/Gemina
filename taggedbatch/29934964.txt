 Anti-tuberculosis ( TB) drugs possess diverse abilities to penetrate the different host tissues and cell types in which infecting Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> bacilli are located during active disease. This is important since there is increasing evidence that the respective `` lesion-penetrating '' properties of the front-line TB drugs appear to correlate well with their specific activity in standard combination therapy. In turn , these observations suggest that rational efforts to discover novel treatment-shortening drugs and drug combinations should incorporate knowledge about the comparative abilities of both existing and experimental anti-TB agents to access bacilli in defined physiological states at different sites of infection , as well as avoid elimination by efflux or inactivation by host or bacterial metabolism. However , while there is a fundamental requirement to understand the mode of action and pharmacological properties of any current or experimental anti-TB agent within the context of the obligate human host , this is complex and , until recently , has been severely limited by the available methodologies and models. Here , we discuss advances in analytical models and technologies which have enabled investigations of drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics ( DMPK) for new TB drug development. In particular , we consider the potential to shift the focus of traditional pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analyses away from plasma to a more specific `` site of action '' drug exposure as an essential criterion for drug development and the design of dosing strategies. Moreover , in summarising approaches to determine DMPK data for the `` unit of infection '' comprising host macrophage and intracellular bacillus<pathogen> , we evaluate the potential benefits of including these analyses at an early stage in the preclinical drug development algorithm.
