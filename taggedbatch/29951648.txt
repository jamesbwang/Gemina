 A visible-light induced three-component reaction of difluoroalkyl halides , unactivated alkenes , and alkynyl sulfones is described , providing a direct and general approach to the construction of synthetically valuable Î²-difluoroalkylated alkynes under room temperature conditions. This represents the first intermolecular alkynyl-difluoroalkylation of unactivated alkenes.
