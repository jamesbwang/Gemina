 The rapid development of artificial intelligence put forward higher requirements for the computational speed , resource consumption and the biological interpretation of computational neuroscience. Spiking neuron networks can carry a large amount of information , and realize the imitation of brain information processing. However , its hardware is an important way to realize its powerful computing ability , and it is also a challenging technical problem. The memristor currently is the electronic devices that functions closest to the neuron synapse , and able to respond to spike voltage in a highly similar spike timing dependent plasticity ( STDP) mechanism with a biological brain , and has become a research hotspot to construct spiking neuron networks hardware circuit in recent years. Through consulting the relevant literature at home and abroad , this paper has made a thorough understanding and introduction to the research work of the spiking neuron networks based on the memristor in recent years.
