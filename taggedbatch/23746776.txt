 Growth monitoring and promotion ( GMP) programmes promote not only child health but serve as a service delivery strategy to enhance coverage for other crucial nutrition-specific interventions. This study compared community-based and facility-based GMP programme with respect to attendance rates , children 's nutritional status , caregivers ' satisfaction with services received and perceptions of service providers and users on factors influencing utilization. Explanatory sequential mixed methods study conducted in Ga West municipality , Ghana. It comprised 12-month secondary data analysis using growth monitoring registers of 220 infants aged 0-3 months enrolled in two community-based ( CB = 104) and two facility-based ( FB = 116) child welfare clinics; cross-sectional survey ( exit interview) of 232 caregiver-child pairs accessing CB ( Mean annual attendance to both programmes was similar with an average of six visits per year. Only 13.6 % of caregiver-child pairs attained more than nine visits in the 12-months period. At least 60 % of children in both programs had improved weight-for-age z-scores ( WAZ) scores during participation. Predictors for improved WAZ were being underweight at baseline ( AOR: 11.1 , 95 % CI: 4.0-31.0) , annual attendance of at least six visits ( AOR: 2.2 , 95 % CI: 1.1-4.1) and meeting the Ghana Health Service target of nine visits ( AOR: 4.65 , 95 % CI: 1.4-15.1). Compared to 31.5 % CB users , significant proportion of FB caregivers ( 57.4 %) were visited at home. Half were dissatisfied with services received ( CB: 55.6 % vs. FB: 62.0 % , The association of increased attendance with improved growth reaffirms the need to strengthen primary healthcare systems to improve service delivery; sensitize caregivers on contribution of growth monitoring and promotion to early child development; and increase contacts through home visits.
