 Slide show presentations have become integral to the workplace , and PowerPoint is ubiquitous since it ships with the Microsoft Office Suite. However , the increasing sophistication of such software may encourage presenters to privilege form over content. It is possible to apply scientific research from Educational Psychology to slide shows so as to not only avoid this fate but also to optimise presentations. This paper applies several Educational Psychology concepts to PowerPoint , most notably those of Mayer 's Multimedia Learning Theory , and will emphasise and demonstrate that the quality of a presentation is dependent on the quality , relevance , and integrity of its content. Slide shows should supplement , and not substitute a presentation. Presenters should avoid prolixity , complexity and gaucheness and strive instead for simplicity , brevity , cogency and clarity.
