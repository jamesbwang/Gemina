 To systematically review the available literature regarding outcomes for the treatment of anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL) injuries in the skeletally immature at skeletal maturity or more than five years after surgery. A systematic search was performed of seven online databases for literature reporting patient reported outcomes for the treatment of ACL injuries in the skeletally immature. A systematic review of this literature was performed examining the outcomes and their association with skeletal immaturity and treatment techniques. A total of 18 articles reported the outcomes of 425 subjects. The mean age at surgery ranged from 10.3 to 15 years. Mean follow-up ranged from 36 to 163 months. Ten studies followed up subjects until skeletal maturity. Mean outcome scores were similar for extraphyseal ( Lysholm 96.2 ( 95.7 to 97.4) , Tegner 6.75 , IKDC 95.4 ( 94 to 100)) and transphyseal surgery ( Lysholm 94.3 ( 84.6-100) , Tegner 7.6 ( 6 to 8.7) , International Knee Documentation Committee ( IKDC) 93.6 ( 84 to 99)). However , the lower range boundary for Lysholm and IKDC was worse for the transphyseal group. The results for non-surgical treatments were worse ( Lysholm 63.2 , Tegner 4.8 , IKDC 87). No significant differences were found in the incidence of limb-length discrepancy ( p = 0.32) , coronal plane growth disturbance ( p = 0.48) , graft rupture ( p = 0.88) and persistent symptomatic instability ( p = 0.11) with transphyseal and extraphyseal surgical techniques. Both transphyseal and extraphyseal reconstructive techniques produced good patient reported outcomes , with no significant differences in the incidence of limb-length discrepancy , coronal plane growth disturbance , graft rupture and persistent symptomatic instability. They compare favourably with the repair techniques reviewed and the natural history of the condition. Further high-quality studies comparing the transphyseal and extraphyseal techniques are required.
