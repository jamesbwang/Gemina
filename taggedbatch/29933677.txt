 This project is to investigate lignans from the dried fruits of Xanthium sibiricum ( Xanthii Fructus). The chemical constituents were extract by 70 % ethanol and isolated by silica gel , ODS , Sephadex LH-20 , MCI column chromatography. Based on comparison of their spectral data with those reported in literature , they were elucidated as (-)- pinoresinol ( 1) , balanophonin A ( 2) , diospyrosin ( 3) , dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol ( 4) , 2- ( 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) -3- ( 2-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenyl) -3-oxo-1-propanol ( 5) , (-)- simulanol ( 6) , (-) -7 R,8S-dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol ( 7) , chushizisin E ( 8) , dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol ( 9) , 7R,8S-dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol 4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside ( 10) , erythro-1,2-bis ( 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) -1,3-propanediol ( 11) , leptolepisol D ( 12) , 8-O-4 ' neolignan 4-O-β-glucopyranoside ( 13) , (-) -1-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-2- ( 2-methoxy-4- ( 1- ( E)- propen-3-ol) phenoxyl)- propane-3-ol ( 14) , 1- ( 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy)- phenyl-2- ( 4- ( 1,2,3-trihydroxypropyl) -2-methoxy)- phenoxy-1,3-propandiol ( 15) , threo-dihydroxy dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol ( 16) , (-)- ( 2R) -1-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-2- ( 2-methoxy-4- ( ( E)- formylviny1) phenoxyl) propane-3-ol ( 17). Compound 2-17 were isolated from the genus Xanthium for the first time. Compound 1 were isolated form Xanthii Fructus for the first time.
