 Progressive left ventricular ( LV) remodelling with cardiac myocyte hypertrophy , myocardial fibrosis<disease> , and endothelial dysfunction plays a key role in the onset and progression of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction. The Beta3-LVH trial will test the hypothesis that the Î² Beta3-LVH is a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , two-armed , multicentre , European , parallel group study. A total of 296 patients will be randomly assigned to receive either mirabegron 50 mg daily or placebo over 12 months. The main inclusion criterion is the presence of LV hypertrophy , that is , increased LV mass index ( LVMi) or increased wall thickening by echocardiography. The co-primary endpoints are a change in LVMi by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and a change in LV diastolic function ( assessed by the E/e ' ratio). Secondary endpoints include mirabegron 's effects on cardiac fibrosis<disease> , left atrial volume index , maximal exercise capacity , and laboratory markers. Two substudies will evaluate mirabegron 's effect on endothelial function by pulse amplitude tonometry and brown fat activity by positron emission tomography using 17F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Morbidity and mortality as well as safety aspects will also be assessed. Beta3-LVH is the first large-scale clinical trial to evaluate the effects of mirabegron on LVMi and diastolic function in patients with LVH. Beta3-LVH will provide important information about the clinical course of this condition and may have significant impact on treatment strategies and future trials in these patients.
