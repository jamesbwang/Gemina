 In many clinical studies , Lin 's ( 1989) concordance correlation coefficient ( CCC) is a popular measure of agreement for continuous outcomes. Most commonly , it is used under the assumption that data are normally distributed. However , in many practical applications , data are often skewed and/or thick-tailed. King and Chinchilli ( 2001) proposed robust estimation methods of alternative CCC indices , and we propose an approach that extends the existing methods of robust estimators by focusing on functionals that yield robust L-statistics. We provide two data examples to illustrate the methodology , and we discuss the results of computer simulation studies that evaluate statistical performance.
