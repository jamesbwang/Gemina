 Ultra-short heart rate variability ( HRV) analysis refers to the study of HRV features in excerpts of length < 5 min. Ultra-short HRV is widely growing in many healthcare applications for monitoring individual 's health and well-being status , especially in combination with wearable sensors , mobile phones , and smart-watches. Long-term ( nominally 24 h) and short-term ( nominally 5 min) HRV features have been widely investigated , physiologically justified and clear guidelines for analysing HRV in 5 min or 24 h are available. Conversely , the reliability of ultra-short HRV features remains unclear and many investigations have adopted ultra-short HRV analysis without questioning its validity. This is partially due to the lack of accepted algorithms guiding investigators to systematically assess ultra-short HRV reliability. This Letter critically reviewed the existing literature , aiming to identify the most suitable algorithms , and harmonise them to suggest a standard protocol that scholars may use as a reference in future studies. The results of the literature review were surprising , because , among the 29 reviewed papers , only one paper used a rigorous method , whereas the others employed methods that were partially or completely unreliable due to the incorrect use of statistical tests. This Letter provides recommendations on how to assess ultra-short HRV features reliably and proposes an inclusive algorithm that summarises the state-of-the-art knowledge in this area.
