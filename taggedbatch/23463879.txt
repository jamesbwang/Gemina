 Splenic abscess<symptom> is a very rare condition in the general population. It is more likely to develop in association with underlying comorbidities and trauma. More attention should be paid in patients with immunosuppression , diabetes mellitus , and congenital or acquired immunocompromise. Splenic rupture secondary to nontraumatic abscess<symptom> causing acute abdomen is a rarer condition. Herein , we report a 55-year-old hemodialysis patient who presented with signs and symptoms of late generalized peritonitis<disease>. The patient was operated under emergency conditions and diagnosed with splenic abscess<symptom> rupture , for which splenectomy with drainage procedure was performed. In such patients , the morbidity and mortality rates vary depending on the intraoperative and postoperative risks.
