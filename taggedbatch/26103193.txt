 We calculated setup margins for whole breast radiotherapy during voluntary deep-inspiration breath-hold ( vDIBH) using real-time surface imaging ( SI). Patients ( n = 58) with a 27-to-31 split between right- and left-sided cancers were analyzed. Treatment beams were gated using AlignRT by registering the whole breast region-of-interest to the surface generated from the simulation CT scan. AlignRT recorded ( three-dimensional) 3D displacements and the beam-on-state every 0.3 s. Means and standard deviations of the displacements during vDIBH for each fraction were used to calculate setup margins. Intra-DIBH stability and the intrafraction reproducibility were estimated from the medians of the 5th to 95th percentile range of the translations in each breath-hold and fraction , respectively. A total of 7269 breath-holds were detected over 1305 fractions in which a median dose of 200 cGy was delivered. Each fraction was monitored for 5.95 ± 2.44 min. Calculated setup margins were 4.8 mm ( A/P) , 4.9 mm ( S/I) , and 6.4 mm ( L/R). The intra-DIBH stability and the intrafraction reproducibility were ≤ 0.7 mm and ≤ 2.2 mm , respectively. The isotropic margin according to SI ( 9.2 mm) was comparable to other institutions ' calculations that relied on x-ray imaging and/or spirometry for patients with left-sided cancer ( 9.8-11.0 mm). Likewise , intra-DIBH variability and intrafraction reproducibility of breast surface measured with SI agreed with spirometry-based positioning to within 1.2 and 0.36 mm , respectively. We demonstrated that intra-DIBH variability , intrafraction reproducibility , and setup margins are similar to those reported by peer studies who utilized spirometry-based positioning.
