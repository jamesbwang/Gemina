 A series of modified calix ( 4) crown-6 derivatives was synthesized to chelate the heavy group 2 metal barium , which serves as a non-radioactive surrogate for radium-223/ -224; radionuclides with promising properties for radiopharmaceutical use. These calixcrowns were functionalized with either cyclic amide moieties or with deprotonizable groups , and the corresponding barium complexes were synthesized. Stability constants of these complexes were measured by using NMR and UV/Vis titration techniques to determine log
