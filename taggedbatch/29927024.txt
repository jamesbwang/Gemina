 A new asymmetric furan and thieno ( 3,2-b) thiophene flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole ( TTFDPP) building block for conjugated polymers is designed and used to generate a donor-acceptor semiconducting polymer , poly ( 3- ( furan-2-yl) -2,5-bis ( 2-octyldodecyl) -6- ( thieno ( 3,2-b) thiophen-2-yl) pyrrolo ( 3,4-c) pyrrole-1,4 ( 2H ,5 H)- dione-alt-thieno ( 3,2-b) thiophene) ( abbreviated to PTTFDPP-TT) , consisting of TTFDPP unit copolymerized with thieno ( 3,2-b) thiophene comonomer ( TT) , which is further synthesized. Results demonstrate that PTTFDPP-TT-based thin-film transistors in a bottom-gate bottom-contact device configuration exhibit typical hole-transporting property , with weak temperature dependence for charge carrier mobility from room temperature to 200 Â°C. In addition , the good solubility of PTTFDPP-TT due to the incorporation of a polar furan unit and an asymmetric conjugated structure makes it able to be solution processed with a less toxic nonchlorinated solvent such as toluene , demonstrating comparable performance with that prepared from chlorinated solution. These results suggest PTTFDPP-TT as a promising organic semiconductor candidate for annealing-free , environmentally benign , and less energy-consuming applications in large-area flexible organic electronic devices.
