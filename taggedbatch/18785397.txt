 Performance-based financing ( PBF) approach is a public health intervention , whose effects on the pillars of this system are often not measured , especially with regard to the information system and to the effectiveness of public health interventions. Our cross-sectional study was conducted in Benin in 67 health units randomly drawn from two PBF_HSS ( Health Systems Strengthening) health zones and two PBF_NHSSP ( Health Sector Support Program) areas , all experiencing PBF , and from two areas where the PBF had not been implemented. It allowed to evaluate the quality of the information and the effectiveness of public health interventions. The quality index and the performance scores of the system components were used to compare the strata covered by the PBF and the noncovered strata. The quality of the information system and of the effectiveness of public health interventions was average in the three strata , with a higher quality index in the PBF_HSS ( 77 %) and PBF_NHSSP ( 74 %) strata than in the Non_PBF ( 67 %) strata. Health system quality distribution was more favorable in the strata covered by PBF. The components achieving a good performance were `` demographic information '' , `` results and essential analyzes '' and `` statistic support archiving ''. However , the essential components of the PBF and of the information system were `` supervision '' and `` reporting '' that continued to have an average QI two years after the beginning of the intervention. The average quality of the information system and of the effectiveness of public health interventions could be improved by respecting the instructions of the PBF , especially when the quality of this system becomes a priority for the PBF.
