 Preclinical validation of scaffold-based technologies in animal models of urethral disease is desired to assess wound<disease><symptom> healing efficacy in scenarios that mimic the target patient population. This study investigates the feasibility of bilayer silk fibroin ( BLSF) scaffolds for the repair of previously damaged urethras in a rabbit model of onlay urethroplasty. A focal , partial thickness urethral injury was created in adult male rabbits ( n = 12) via electrocoagulation and then onlay urethroplasty with 50 mm At 2 wk after electrocoagulation , urethroscopic and RUG evaluations confirmed urethral stricture formation in 92 % ( n = 11/12) of rabbits. Gross tissue assessments at 1 ( n = 3) and 3 ( n = 6) mo after onlay urethroplasty revealed host tissue ingrowth covering the entire implant site. At 3 mo post-op , RUG analyses of repaired urethral segments demonstrated a 39 % reduction in urethral stenosis detected following electrocoagulation injury. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed the formation of innervated , vascularized neotissues with α-smooth muscle actin + and SM22α + smooth muscle bundles and pan-cytokeratin + epithelium at graft sites. These results demonstrate the feasibility of BLSF matrices to support the repair of previously damaged urethral tissues.
