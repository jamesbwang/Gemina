 Congenital pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae<disease> occur as a result of abnormal<symptom> blood vessel development in the lungs. Blood takes a short pass from the pulmonary artery to veins. Multiple<symptom> pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae<disease> are a rare occurrence , especially when involving both lungs. Fistulae<disease> located at the edge are prone to rupture and bleeding. We discuss a case of a 15-year-old overweight male with multiple<symptom> pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae<disease> successfully treated with wedge-shape excision via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.
