 Fatty acid oxidation ( FAO) , the main source of energy produced by tubular epithelial cells in the kidney , was found to be defective in tubulo-interstitial samples dissected out in kidney biopsies from patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD). Experimental data indicated that this decrease was a strong determinant of renal fibrogenesis , hence a focus for therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless , whether persistently differentiated renal tubules , surviving in a pro-fibrotic environment , also suffer from a decrease in FAO , is currently unknown. To address this question , we isolated proximal tubules captured ex vivo on the basis of the expression of an intact brush border antigen ( Prominin-1) in C57BL6/J mice subjected to a controlled , two-hit model of renal fibrosis<disease> ( reversible ischemic acute kidney injury ( AKI) or sham surgery , followed by angiotensin 2 administration). A transcriptomic high throughput sequencing was performed on total mRNA from these cells , and on whole kidneys. In contrast to mice subjected to sham surgery , mice with a history of AKI displayed histologically more renal fibrosis<disease> when exposed to angiotensin 2. High throughput RNA sequencing , principal component analysis and clustering showed marked consistency within experimental groups. As expected , FAO transcripts were decreased in whole fibrotic kidneys. Surprisingly , however , up- rather than down-regulation of metabolic pathways ( oxidative phosphorylation , fatty acid metabolism , glycolysis , and PPAR signalling pathway) was a hallmark of the differentiated tubules captured from fibrotic kidneys. Immunofluorescence co-staining analysis confirmed that the expression of FAO enzymes was dependent of tubular trophicity. These data suggest that in differentiated proximal tubules energetic hyperactivity is promoted concurrently with organ fibrogenesis.
