 It is challenging to image extremely obese and claustrophobic patients using a standard , non-open , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) scanner. On the other hand , installing an additional upright or open MRI scanner may not be cost-effective for most practices. Our technique with a patient in a sitting or standing position behind the standard MRI scanner may be helpful in the MR examination of the wrist/elbow in these patients using a standard wrist/elbow coil. We performed wrist and elbow MRI of extremely obese and claustrophobic patients by using our modified technique with the patient sitting or standing outside the standard non-open MRI scanner. A total number of 20 cases with the following diagnosis were examined: triquetral and scaphoid bone contusions and fractures , scapholunate ligament tears , triangular fibrocartilage complex tear , and biceps tear. Comparison of image quality for diagnostic information between the standard technique and our technique showed no significant difference , which is necessary for making the diagnosis. Our technique enables wrist and elbow imaging of extremely obese and claustrophobic patients who can not otherwise be imaged using a standard MRI scanner without compromising the image quality that is essential for making a diagnosis.
