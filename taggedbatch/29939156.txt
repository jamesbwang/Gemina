 TNS/Cu ( X) composite materials were firstly synthesized via simple overnight stirring of TNS in the methanolic solution of Cu complexes. The developed TNS/Cu ( X) composites had a well-designed nanostructure , in which the TNS and Cu complexes were closely bounded with each other. The biphenylamine complexes fixed on the TNS surface in form of nanocapsules , which were confirmed by TEM and SEM , thus improving the surface area and subsequently charge separation. Innovatively merged photocatalysts of Cu complexes with TNS were successfully verified for photocatalytic mineralization of colored and colorless organic contaminants under the visible light degradation. As compared to original TNS , TNS/Cu ( BA) showed prominent improvement in the catalytic actions. Kinetics i.e. t
