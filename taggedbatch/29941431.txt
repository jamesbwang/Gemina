 The human ether-a-go-go-related gene ( hERG) encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that controls repolarization of cardiac action potentials. Accumulating evidence suggests that most disease-related hERG mutations reduce the function of the channel by disrupting protein biogenesis of the channel in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER). However , the molecular mechanism underlying the biogenesis of ERG K
