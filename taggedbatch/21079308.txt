 Narrow-band UVB ( NB-UVB) has been shown to be one of the most effective treatment modalities for psoriasis. Tazarotene , a known effective anti-psoriatic modality , when combined with NB-UVB may enhance the therapeutic success. To study clinical efficacy and safety of combination of NB-UVB with topical tazarotene 0.05 % gel in psoriasis. Thirty patients with plaque psoriasis having symmetrical lesions<symptom> were enrolled for 12 weeks. All patients were instructed to apply tazarotene gel on target plaque on left side of body once daily. In addition , the whole body was irradiated with NB-UVB twice weekly. Efficacy was assessed by target plaque scoring and number of treatment sessions for clearance. Our study resulted in 3 key findings: Firstly , therapeutic efficacy of NB-UVB was enhanced by addition of tazarotene. This enhanced efficacy was more apparent in decreasing scaling and thickness as compared to decrease in erythema. Secondly , combination therapy showed faster clearance of target plaques , with reduction in mean number of treatment sessions. Thirdly , mean cumulative NB-UVB dose needed to achieve clearance of target plaques was significantly reduced with combination therapy. The study was not randomized or controlled , but an open-label trial. The study period was relatively short , i.e. , 12 weeks , without any follow-up period. Tazarotene gel significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacy of NB-UVB irradiation with faster clearance and without serious side effects.
