 Amylosucrase ( EC 2.4.1.4 , ASase) , an outstanding sucrose-utilizing transglucosylase in the glycoside hydrolase family 13 , can produce glucans with only Î±-1,4 linkages. Generally , on account of a double-displacement mechanism , ASase can catalyze polymerization , isomerization , and hydrolysis reactions with sucrose as the sole substrate , and has transglycosylation capacity to attach glucose molecules from sucrose to extra glycosyl acceptors. Based on extensive enzymology research , this review presents the characteristics of various ASases , including their microbial metabolism , preparation , and enzymatic properties , and exhibits structure-based strategies in the improvement of activity , specificity , and thermostability. As a vital transglucosylation tool of producing sugars , carbohydrate-based bioactive compounds , and materials , the bioengineering applications of ASases are also systematically summarized.
