 Experiments are presented on real-time probing of coherent electron dynamics in xenon initiated by strong-field double ionization. Attosecond transient absorption measurements allow for characterization of electronic coherences as well as relative ionization timings in multiple electronic states of Xe ^ ( +) and Xe ^ ( 2 +). A high degree of coherence g = 0.4 is observed between ^ ( 3) P _ ( 2) ^ ( 0)- ^ ( 3) P _ ( 0) ^ ( 0) of Xe ^ ( 2 +) , whereas for other possible pairs of states the coherences are below the detection limits of the experiments. A comparison of the experimental results with numerical simulations based on an uncorrelated electron-emission model shows that the coherences produced by strong-field double ionization are more selective than predicted. Surprisingly short ionization time delays , 0.85 fs , 0.64 fs , and 0.75 fs relative to Xe ^ ( +) formation , are also measured for the ^ ( 3) P _ ( 2) , ^ ( 3) P _ ( 0) , and ^ ( 3) P _ ( 1) states of Xe ^ ( 2 +) , respectively. Both the unpredicted selectivity in the formation of coherence and the subfemtosecond time delays of specific states provide new insight into correlated electron dynamics in strong-field double ionization.
