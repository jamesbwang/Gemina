 Neuraxial labor analgesia may benefit obese women by optimizing cardiorespiratory function and mitigating complications related to emergency general anesthesia. We hypothesized that obese women have a higher rate of neuraxial analgesia compared with nonobese parturients. Using U.S. natality data , our cohort comprised 17,220,680 deliveries , which accounts for 61.5 % of 28 million births in the United States between 2009 and 2015. We examined the relationships between body mass index class and neuraxial labor analgesia , adjusting for sociodemographic , antenatal , pregnancy , and peripartum factors. The study cohort comprised 17,220,680 women; 0.1 % were underweight , 12.7 % were normal body mass index , 37 % were overweight , and 28.3 % , 13.5 % , and 8.4 % were obesity class I , II , and III , respectively. Rates of neuraxial analgesia by body mass index class were as follows: underweight , 59.7 % ( 9,030/ 15,128); normal body mass index , 68.1 % ( 1,487,117/ 2,182,797); overweight , 70.3 % ( 4,476,685/ 6,368,656); obesity class I , 71.8 % ( 3,503,321/ 4,881,938); obesity class II , 73.4 % ( 1,710,099/ 2,330,028); and obesity class III , 75.6 % ( 1,089,668/ 1,442,133). Compared to women with normal body mass index , the likelihood of receiving neuraxial analgesia was slightly increased for overweight women ( adjusted relative risk , 1.02; 95 % CI , 1.02 to 1.02) , obese class I ( adjusted relative risk , 1.04; 95 % CI , 1.04 to 1.04) , obese class II ( adjusted relative risk , 1.05; 95 % CI , 1.05 to 1.05) , and obese class III ( adjusted relative risk , 1.06; 95 % CI , 1.06 to 1.06). Our findings suggest that the likelihood of receiving neuraxial analgesia is only marginally increased for morbidly obese women compared to women with normal body mass index.
