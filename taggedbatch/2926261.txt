 This study was performed to assess whether there is an association between elevated Fasting Blood Glucose ( FBG) and hearing impairment in Bangladeshi population. A total of 142 subjects ( 72 with elevated FBG; 70 control) were included in the study. The mean auditory thresholds of the control subjects at 1 , 4 , 8 and 12 kHz frequencies were 6.35 ± 0.35 , 10.07 ± 0.91 , 27.57 ± 1.82 , 51.28 ± 3.01 dB SPL ( decibel sound pressure level) , respectively and that of the subjects with elevated FBG were 8.33 ± 0.66 , 14.37 ± 1.14 , 38.96 ± 2.23 , and 71.11 ± 2.96 dB , respectively. The auditory thresholds of the subjects with elevated FBG were significantly ( p < 0.05) higher than the control subjects at all the above frequencies , although hearing impairment was most evidently observed at an extra-high ( 12 kHz) frequency. Subjects with a long duration of diabetes ( > 10 years) showed significantly ( p < 0.05) higher level of auditory thresholds at 8 and 12 kHz , but not at 1 and 4 kHz frequencies , compared to subjects with shorter duration of diabetes ( ≤ 10 years). In addition , based on the data of odds ratio , more acute<symptom> impairment<symptom> of hearing at the extra-high frequency was observed in diabetic subjects of both older ( > 40 years) and younger ( ≤ 40 years) age groups compared to the respective controls. The binary logistic regression analysis showed a 5.79-fold increase in the odds of extra-high frequency hearing impairment in diabetic subjects after adjustment for age , gender and BMI. This study provides conclusive evidence that auditory threshold at an extra-high frequency could be a sensitive marker for hearing impairment in diabetic subjects.
