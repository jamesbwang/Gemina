 Endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS) encoded by nitric oxide synthase 3 ( NOS3) , can generate nitric oxide ( NO) which serves as an important deterrent to the pathogenesis of thrombosis by modulating the activation , adhesion and aggregate formation of platelets. Three serum miRNAs ( miR-195 , miR-532 and miR-582) have been suggested as biomarkers for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT) , however their potential roles in DVT is not clear. The effect of miRNAs inhibiting the expression of NOS3 was evaluated in vitro. miR-195 , miR-532 and miR-582 mimic , inhibitor , and control miRNAs were transfected into endothelial cells. The roles of miR-195 , miR-532 and miR-582 regulating the expression of eNOS were evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR , Western Blotting and luciferase reporter assays. NO release was measured by Griess method. We confirmed NOS3 as a direct target of miR-195 and miR-582 , which binds to the 3 '- UTR of NOS3 mRNA in endothelial cells. A significantly inverse correlation between these two miRNAs and eNOS expression was detected. NO release from endothelial cells was decreased when the expression level of miR-195 and miR-582 was up-regulated. These findings indicated that miR-195 and miR-582 regulated NO release by targeting 3 '- UTR of NOS3 post-transcriptionally in endothelial cells. Therefore , miR-195 and miR-582 might play an important role in maintaining endothelial NO bioavailability and could be a novel target for treatment of thrombotic diseases.
