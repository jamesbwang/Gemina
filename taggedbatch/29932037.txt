 Because of unknown situation of antibiotic resistance pattern in main hospital in Ilam , Iran , in an attempt we aimed to evaluate the antibiotic resistance pattern of uropathogenic bacteria obtained from referred patients to Imam Khomaini Hospital , Ilam , Iran. For this reason , 114 bacteria were collected during 9 month period and evaluated for their antibiotic resistance pattern. Our results demonstrated that E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> as the dominant responsible for urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease>. Our results demonstrated that 61.4 % ( n = 70) of isolates were positive for E.coli , while the lowest prevalence observed for Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen>. The results demonstrated that 6.4 % ( n = 7) were MBL producer. Despite , only 4 gram positive bacteria were obtained from patients with urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> but 100 % ( n = 1) of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> were methicillin resistant S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA) and 66.7 % ( n = 2) of E.<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> were positive for resistance to vancomycin. In conclusion , we strongly recommended doing the cohort study among all hospital in Iran to evaluate the situation of antibiotic resistance and make a real panel to control this issue.
