 The background of this study is twofold: basic methodological differences between Western Biomedicine and Classical Chinese Medicine ( CCM) and obvious parallels between the methodology of psychotherapy and CCM. Drawing on available investigations on the methodology of CCM , the analysis of structural parallels between CCM and Western psychotherapy tries to enrich the methodological self-conception of psychotherapy in order to provide impulses for the new approaches to psychotherapeutic practice. The reciprocal interpretation of CCM about the patient 's state draws on a language of metaphors. These metaphors `` mediate '' between the various positions of the universal interdependency and the human being , who is able to understand the language. The constructive realistic methodology in general and the epistemological method of `` alienation '' in particular , provide an instrument for the decodification of these metaphors. In the context of CCM , the process dynamics of mental healing are based on hermeneutical principals. Every operation carried out by the CCM therapist is not organ medical in nature but a purely semantic form. These semantic operations aim to provide a meaningful integration of problematical behavior ( in terms of meaning) into metaphorically logical structures in order to stimulate a coherent self-understanding of the suffering individual , which is associated with healing effects. In this context , it is crucial for CCM that there is no conceptual division between body and soul with respect to the therapy. This enables a completely different comprehensive treatment of mental problems than biomedicine is able to offer , due to its methodological presuppositions.
