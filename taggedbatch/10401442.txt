 Smartphones are being used with increasing frequency to deliver behavioral interventions for depression<symptom> via apps. However , barriers specific to using an app for depression<symptom> are poorly defined. The purpose of the current study is to identify barriers to the use of a mobile app to deliver treatment for depression<symptom>. Secondarily , design implications will be provided based upon identified barriers. A card sorting task that ranked and grouped barriers to the use of apps for depression<symptom> was completed. Participants first completed a card sorting task identifying barriers to face-to-face treatment , as a primer to identification of treatment barriers. The sample consisted of those above ( The card sorting task identified a number of primary barriers to the use of apps for depression<symptom> treatment , including concerns over intervention efficacy , app functioning , privacy , cost , and lack of guidance and tailored feedback. The top face-to-face treatment barrier was cost , overlapping with mobile barriers. This study identified perceived barriers to the use of mobile treatment apps. Identification of barriers implicates design recommendations for apps for depression<symptom>.
