 Current studies have evaluated the association between CD14-260 ( also known as -159) C/T polymorphism and Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) susceptibility. However , the association remains inconclusive. The aim of this study was to draw an accurate conclusion of the association. The literature search was conducted using PubMed , Embase , Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure , China Biological Medicine Database , and Wanfang Databases for related articles. Four case-control studies with a total of 868 cases and 766 controls were eligible to be included in this meta-analysis. The association was evaluated by calculating the odds ratios ( ORs) with the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). Overall , there was no significant association between CD14-260C / T polymorphism and AD risk in all genetic models ( the allele model T vs. C: OR = 1.06 , 95 % CI 0.92-1.21 , p = 0.44; the homozygous model TT vs. CC: OR = 1.09 , 95 % CI 0.83-1.44 , p = 0.53; the heterozygote model CT vs. CC: OR = 0.95 , 95 % CI 0.75-1.22 , p = 0.71; the dominant model TT + CT vs. CC: OR = 1.05 , 95 % CI 0.84-1.32 , p = 0.66; the recessive model TT vs. CT + CC: OR = 1.14 , 95 % CI 0.92-1.43 , p = 0.24). The sample size of 5064 was calculated by applying trial sequential analysis. Cumulative z curve does not cross trial sequential monitoring boundary. In conclusion , the present meta-analysis suggests that the CD14-260C/ T polymorphism may not be associated with genetic susceptibility of AD , but the association remains indeterminate due to the insufficient evidence.
