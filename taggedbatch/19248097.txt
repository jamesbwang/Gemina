 This study aimed to assess the effect of age and osteoporosis on the proliferative and differentiating capacity of bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) in female rats. We also discuss the role of these factors on expression and migration of cells along the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 ( CXCR-4)/ stromal derived factor 1 ( SDF-1) axis. Mesenchymal stem cells were harvested from the femora of young , adult , and osteopenic Wistar rats. Cluster of differentiation ( CD) marker and CXCR-4 expression was measured using flow cytometry. Cellular proliferation was measured using Alamar Blue , osteogenic differentiation was measured using alkaline phosphatase expression and alizarin red production , and adipogenic differentiation was measured using Oil red O. Cells were incubated in Boyden chambers to quantify their migration towards SDF-1. Data was analyzed using a Student 's CD marker expression and proliferation of the MSCs from the three groups was not significantly different. The young MSCs demonstrated significantly increased differentiation into bone and fat and superior migration towards SDF-1. The migration of SDF-1 doubled with young rats compared with the adult rats ( p = 0.023) and it was four times higher when compared with cells isolated from ovariectomized ( OVX) osteopenic rats ( p = 0.013). Young rat MSCs are significantly more responsive to osteogenic differentiation , and , contrary to other studies , also demonstrated increased adipogenic differentiation compared with cells from adult and ostopenic rats. Young-rat-derived cells also showed superior migration towards SDF-1 compared with MSCs from OVX and adult control rats.
