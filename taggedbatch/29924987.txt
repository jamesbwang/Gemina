 Splicing efficiency varies among transcripts , and tight control of splicing kinetics is crucial for coordinated gene expression. N-6-methyladenosine ( m6A) is the most abundant RNA modification and is involved in regulation of RNA biogenesis and function. The impact of m6A on regulation of RNA splicing kinetics is unknown. Here , we provide a time-resolved high-resolution assessment of m6A on nascent RNA transcripts and unveil its importance for the control of RNA splicing kinetics. We find that early co-transcriptional m6A deposition near splice junctions promotes fast splicing , while m6A modifications in introns are associated with long , slowly processed introns and alternative splicing events. In conclusion , we show that early m6A deposition specifies the fate of transcripts regarding splicing kinetics and alternative splicing.
