 To assess the prognostic importance of serum levels of osteopontin ( OP) , stanniocalcin-1 ( SC) , FGF-23 , alpha Klotho and 25-OH-D at the time of diagnosis in renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) patients a total of 56 RCC patients with staging â‰¥ pT1b were enrolled in a prospective study. The relationship between the serum level of the analysed parameters and recurrence-free survival ( RFS) , overall survival ( OS) and cancer-specific survival ( CSS) was examined. Control group consisted of 20 patients without cancer. Level of osteopontin , stanniocalcin-1 , FGF-23 and alpha Klotho were determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA) , 25-OH-D by chemiluminiscence immunoanalysis ( CLIA). The follow-up period median was 46 months. Renal cell carcinoma recurred in 9 patients , 20 patients died during the follow-up , 12 of them from RCC. The level of osteopontin and stanniocalcin-1 varied between the control group and RCC patients ( p = 0.02 and p = 0.0003 , respectively). Higher levels of stanniocalcin-1 were detected in metastatic RCC group versus localized RCC group ( p = 0.003). Only stanniocalcin-1 level at the time of surgery was associated with RFS ( p = 0.0004). Both OS and CSS were associated with the osteopontin , stanniocalcin-1 and FGF-23 preoperative level. Patients with level of stanniocalcin-1 more than 1277 pg/ml and osteopontin level more than 100 ng/ ml had 17.8 times higher and 7.9 times higher risk of dying due to RCC progression , respectivelly ( p Keywords: Renal cell carcinoma , osteopontin , stanniocalcin-1 , overall survival , cancer-specific survival , recurrence-free survival.
