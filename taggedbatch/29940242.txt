 Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) is one of the most common causes of dementia. AD pathogenesis has been hypothesized to involve cholinergic deficits , amyloid-beta protein ( AÎ²) deposition , tau protein hyperphosphorylation , and chronic neuroinflammation. Many single-target drugs have gone through the various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development in an effort to cure AD; however , the current clinically approved drugs have only limited effects on the disease progression. With the accumulation of unsuccessful clinical trials using single-target drugs , multi-target directed ligand ( MTDL) drug development is becoming more common. MTDLs incorporate two or more pharmacophores into a single drug molecule. This approach can alleviate side effects and lead to a better pharmacokinetic profile of the MTDL compared to two or more separate drugs representing respective single pharmacophores. This review discusses cathepsin B ( CatB) , dual specificity phosphatase 2 ( DUSP2) , and monoglycerol lipase ( MAGL) as targets for MTDLs aimed at slowing down the neuroinflammatory component of neurodegenerative diseases. CatB , DUSP2 and MAGL inhibitors show promising preclinical anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and in vitro. Incorporating pharmacophores that inhibit these targets into MTDLs represents a promising avenue towards effective suppression of neuroinflammation associated with AD.
