 To examine postpartum recurrence rates of depression<symptom> comparing women receiving antidepressant treatment to women not being treated with psychotropic medication. This was a prospective study of 130 women with major depressive disorder ( MDD) who attended a tertiary care perinatal clinic during and after pregnancy. Depression<symptom> recurrence was defined as a score of 13 or more on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression<symptom> Scale ( EPDS) or a score of greater than 13 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS). Over half of women ( 56.9 %) were not receiving medication during pregnancy to treat their mood disorder , with the rate of medication use increasing over the 1-year postpartum period. When comparing women being treated with antidepressant medication ( monotherapy or combination therapy) to women receiving no psychotropic medication , no significant differences in recurrence rates were observed during the postpartum period. However , we did observe that the occurrence of depression<symptom> in our sample fluctuated between rates comparable to general population estimates to rates that were at times more than twofold higher , regardless of treatment with antidepressant medication. The findings of this study align with research which suggests that the postpartum period is a particularly vulnerable time for recurrence of depression<symptom>. Moreover , our results suggest that this remains the case regardless of antidepressant treatment.
