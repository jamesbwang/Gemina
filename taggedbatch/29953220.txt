 Melatonin acts as a crucial signaling and antioxidant molecule with multiple physiological functions in organisms. To explore effects of exogenous melatonin on postharvest browning and its possible mechanisms in litchi fruit , ` Ziniangxi ' litchi fruits were treated with an aqueous solution of melatonin at 0.4 mM and then stored at 25 Â°C for 8 days. The results revealed that melatonin strongly suppressed pericarp browning and delayed discoloration during storage. Melatonin treatment reduced relative membrane-leakage rate and inhibited the generation of superoxide radicals ( O
