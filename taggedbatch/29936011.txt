 To investigate the correlation of circulating long non-coding RNA nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 ( lncRNA NEAT1) expression with disease risk , severity , prognosis and inflammatory cytokine levels in sepsis<disease> patients. 152 sepsis<disease> patients and 150 health controls ( HCs) were enrolled in this study. Plasma and serum samples were obtained from sepsis<disease> patients and HCs , and lncRNA NEAT1 expression in plasma was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction , while levels of inflammatory cytokines in serum were detected by enzyme linked immune sorbent assay. LncRNA NEAT1 expression was remarkably higher in sepsis<disease> patients than in HCs ( P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve disclosed a good predictive value of lncRNA NEAT1 expression for sepsis<disease> risk with area under curve ( AUC) of 0.730 ( 95 % CI: 0.740-0.861). Subsequent multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that lncRNA NEAT1 expression was independently associated with higher sepsis<disease> risk ( P < 0.001). In sepsis<disease> patients , lncRNA NEAT1 expression was also observed to be positively correlated with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE) II score ( P < 0.001) , serum tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( P < 0.001) , interleukin ( IL) -1 β ( P = 0.043) , IL-6 ( P = 0.001) and IL-8 ( P = 0.038) , while negatively correlated with IL-10 ( P < 0.001). In addition , lncRNA NEAT1 expression was increased in non-survivors compared to survivors ( P = 0.006) , and ROC curve revealed a good prognostic value of lncRNA NEAT1 for non-survivor risk with AUC 0.641 ( 95 % CI: 0.536-0.746). Circulating lncRNA NEAT1 correlates with increased disease risk , elevated severity and unfavorable prognosis as well as higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in sepsis<disease> patients.
