 This study investigated the effects of high hydrostatic pressure ( HHP) and ultraviolet radiation ( UV-C) , individually and combined , on the physical , chemical and bacterial parameters of Nile<pathogen><disease> tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus) fillets stored at 4 °C for 14 days. Tilapia fillets were divided into four groups: control ( untreated samples) , UV-C , HHP , and UV-C combined with HHP ( UV-C + HHP); UV-C was applied at dose of 0.103 ± 0.002 J/cm
