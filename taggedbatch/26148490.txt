 The objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between chronic rhino-sinusitis ( CRS) and systemic symptoms in patients with IgG4-related disease ( IgG4-RD). The patients with IgG4-RD , confirmed by restrict association with clinical and histopathological manifestations between March 2013 and July 2016 , were enrolled and followed-up for 1 year at the Tongren Hospital , Capital Medical University. The patients were divided into two groups: the case group included IgG4-RD patients with CRS confirmed by clinical and imaging , while the control group included IgG4-RD patients without CRS confirmed by clinical and imaging. Age , gender , clinical manifestations , the percentage of eosinophils in peripheral blood , sedimentation ( ESR) , C-reaction protein , serum IgE and IgG4 levels , histopathology , and treatment drugs at the baseline and 1 year of follow-up were compared between the two groups. A total of 46 cases met the diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD. A total of 30 patients ( 65.2 %) had IgG4-RD complicated with CRS , and were aged 49.7 Â± 13.4 years , with male: female ratio = 2:1. The disease duration in the case group was longer than that in the control group ( 3.0 versus 0.8 , p = 0.009). The ratio of ocular involvement was higher ( 86.7 versus 60 % , p < 0.001) , and allergic manifestations including drug allergy , asthma , and allergic skin were more common ( 56.5 versus 20 % , p = 0.004) , with a higher percentage of eosinophils in peripheral blood ( 8.5 versus 3.3 % , p = 0.018) and more sensitive to glucocorticoids ( 6.0 versus 3.5 , p = 0.004) than those in the control group. CRS in patients with IgG4-RD was closely associated with IgG4-related ocular lesions<symptom> , which was more prone to allergic manifestations accompanied by raised percentage of eosinophils in peripheral blood. The treatment of patients with IgG4-RD complicated with CRS was more effective than those with IgG4-RD without CRS.
