 Intestinal cell models have been widely studied and used to evaluate absorption and metabolism of drugs in the small intestine , constituting valuable tools as a first approach to evaluate the behavior of new drugs. However , such cell models might not be able to fully predict the absorption mechanisms and metabolic pathways of the tested compounds. In recent years , induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs) differentiated into enterocyte-like cells have been proposed as more biorelevant intestinal models. In this review , we describe mechanisms underlying the differentiation of iPSCs into enterocyte-like cells , appraise the usefulness of these cells in tridimensional intestinal models , and discuss their suitability to be used in the future for drug screening.
