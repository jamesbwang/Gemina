 Thrombosis is a consequence of disbalance between the procoagulant and fibrinolytic activity of blood and is frequently associated with chronic sequelae , which are the consequence of chronic occlusion of affected veins. Treatment of venous thrombosis should not be oriented in the prevention of thrombus progression and associated thromboembolic events , but also in stimulation of thrombolysis and recanalization of occluded veins , which are one of the most important preventive mechanisms of late sequelae , including post-thrombotic syndrome<disease><symptom>. The treatment of acute venous thrombosis ( superficial and deep) is based on drugs with anticoagulant activity , like antagonists of vitamin K , heparins , and new oral anticoagulants. One of the most frequently used anticoagulant drugs is heparin , particularly the low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH). It was shown that besides strong anticoagulant activity heparin has pro-fibrinolytic effects , which promote thrombolysis and recanalization of occluded veins. LMWH markedly increases tissue factor pathway inhibitor levels and a release of tissue plasminogen activator from vascular endothelium. Heparins are also capable of increasing the nitrogen oxide level , which is responsible for circulatory homeostasis.
