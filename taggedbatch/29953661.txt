 This study described the steps needed to achieve full oral feeding before discharge in a group of very and extremely preterm ( EPT) infants. We analysed the effects of oral feeding skills on discharge timing and on weight gain during their neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU) stay. A prospective cross-sectional observational study of 100 infants who were < 32 weeks of gestation ( GA) was conducted at the Division of Neonatology , Graz , Austria , from March 2014 to February 2015. Patients were stratified into two groups: those who were < 28 weeks at birth and those who were 28 weeks and over. Velocity of oral feeding skills attainment and weight gain were analysed. All infants successfully acquired oral feeding skills during hospitalisation. The median GA at which full oral feeding skills were reached was 37 + 1 weeks in EPT and 34 + 5 weeks in very preterm infants. More immature neonates showed worse feeding performances and lower weight increments during oral feeding steps. Our study confirmed the role of GA in the development of oral feeding skills in the most premature babies. It also raises the question of whether expected daily weight gain should be targeted according to GA..
