 Pain is the main factor that determines the postoperative course for patients undergoing pectus bar placement. Cryoablation of the intercostal nerves has been suggested to mitigate this pain. We instituted a protocol for using intercostal cryoablation and report our early results compared to our immediately previous cohort. A retrospective study was conducted on patients undergoing minimally invasive repair for pectus excavatum between January 1 , 2017 , and August 21 , 2017. Demographic data , anthropometrics , operative times , type and duration of patient analgesia , and postoperative length of stay were collected. Descriptive statistics were performed with all means reported ± standard deviations. Comparisons between groups were analyzed on STATA using T-tests with a P value < .05 determined as significant. Twenty-eight patients were treated for pectus excavatum during the study period with 9 ( 32 %) undergoing cryoablation. Mean number of rib spaces ablated was 5 ± 0.53 with no reported intraoperative complications. Mean operative time was 30 minutes longer in the cryoablation group ( P = .00). Days to only oral pain medication was shorter in the cryoablation group , ( 1.22 ± 0.66 day versus 2.63 ± 0.68 day , P = .00). Length of stay , in days , was shorter in the cryoablation group ( 1.4 ± 0.72 days versus 4.0 ± 1.0 days , P = .00). There were no reported complications from cryoablation or bar placement during the study period. Days to discontinuation of oral narcotics were less in the cryoablation group ( 8.2 ± 7.0 versus 18.2 ± 10.4 , P = .00). Cryoablation after pectus bar placement dramatically decreases narcotic usage and postoperative length of stay.
