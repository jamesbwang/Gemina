 There is no consensus concerning the management of adult posterior fossa metastasis-associated obstructive hydrocephalus<symptom> patients , especially regarding surgical procedures. Literature review to assess the surgical strategy in the management of metastatic brain tumor patients. Literature search conducted on PubMed in November 2017 to identify all studies concerning brain metastases and obstructive hydrocephalus<symptom> in the English language. All studies between December 1953 and November 2017 , except case reports and paediatric studies , which were about posterior fossa metastasis-associated obstructive hydrocephalus<symptom> in adult patients. Eligible studies were classified by level of evidence. We assessed epidemiology , clinical and imaging findings , neurosurgical management and prognosis of posterior fossa metastasis-associated obstructive hydrocephalus<symptom> adult patients. We suggest some practical considerations and a management decision-tree on the behalf of the Neuro-oncology Club of the French Society of Neurosurgery with evidence-based analysis. Direct surgical resection could be considered for asymptomatic obstructive hydrocephalus<symptom> patients and endoscopic third ventriculostomy seems to be a reasonable procedure for symptomatic obstructive hydrocephalus<symptom> patients. Ventriculoperitoneal or atrial shunt seems to be a valid alternative when patients have a history of central nervous system infection or ventricular haemorrhage , leptomeningeal carcinomatosis , or unfavorable anatomy to perform an endoscopic third ventriculostomy. No formal recommendations can be made due to the low level of scientific evidence. The Neuro-oncology Club of the French Society of Neurosurgery suggests a prospective assessment of these neurosurgical procedures in order to compare their respective safeties and efficacies.
