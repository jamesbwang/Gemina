 The antiviral metabolites from bacterial stress response to bacteriophage infection can maintain homeostasis of host cells , while metabolism disorder is a remarkable characteristic of tumorigenesis. In the aspect of metabolic homeostasis , therefore , the antiviral homeostasis-maintaining metabolites of bacteria may possess anti-tumor activity. However , this issue has not been addressed. Here we show that the homeostasis-challenged maintaining metabolites from deep-sea bacteriophage-challenged thermophile can suppress tumor metastasis. The results indicated that the metabolic profiles of the bacteriophage GVE2-infected and virus-free thermophile Geobacillus sp.. E263 from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent were remarkably different. Thirteen metabolites were significantly elevated and two metabolites were downregulated in thermophile stress response to GVE2 infection. As an example , the upregulated L-norleucine was characterized. The data showed that L-norleucine had antiviral activity in thermophile. Furthermore , the in vitro and in vivo assays revealed that L-norleucine , as well as its derivative , significantly suppressed metastasis of gastric and breast cancer cells. L-norleucine interacted with hnRNPA2/B1 protein to inhibit the expressions of Twist1 and Snail , two inhibitors of E-cadherin , and promote the E-cadherin expression , leading to the inhibition of tumor metastasis. Therefore , our study presented that antiviral homeostasis-maintaining metabolites of microbes might be a promising source for anti-tumor drugs.
