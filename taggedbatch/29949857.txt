 Colorectal cancer ( CRC) remains a deadly disease , afflicting the lives of millions worldwide. The prognosis of CRC patients is best predicted by surgical resection and pathological analysis of specimens. Emerging evidence has attributed a significant role to inflammatory markers and microRNAs ( miRNAs) in the prognosis and survival of CRC patients. Here , we review the literature on inflammatory markers and miRNAs with an established role on survival rates , response to systemic chemotherapy , and other clinic-pathological parameters in CRC patients. Our literature review revealed a critical role of inflammatory markers-- specifically , the acute-phase proteins , inflammatory cytokines , and blood cell ratios-- on prognostic outcomes in CRC patients. MiRNAs , on the other hand , were useful in predicting prognosis and clinical response and accordingly stratifying CRC patients for optimal drug selection. These biomarkers are easily measured in routine blood exams and can be used in adjunct to the tumor-node-metastasis ( TNM) staging system to identify high-risk patients and those who are more likely to benefit from chemotherapy and other targeted therapies. However , more prospective studies are needed for the validation of these discussed prognostic and predictive biomarkers.
