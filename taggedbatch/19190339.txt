 Squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity is one of the most common cancers of Indian subcontinent with the 5-year survival rate of 50 % despite the recent advances in the treatment. The aim of the present study was to study cancer stem cell markers CD133 and Oct-4 in oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC) patients and their correlation with clinicopathological variables. This was a prospective study which included 50 cases of histopathologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity. Expression of CD133 and Oct-4 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry ( IHC) and their expression was correlated with various clinicopathological and demographic parameters. CD133 expression was seen in 20.6 % cases of clinical Stage I-II and in 79.4 % of clinical stage of III-IV OSCC patients , the difference being statistically significant with the CD133 expression was significantly seen higher in Stage III-IV tumors , the stem cells may be responsible for the aggressiveness of the OSCCs and these stem cells can be potential prognostic markers and targets for the future targeted therapy.
