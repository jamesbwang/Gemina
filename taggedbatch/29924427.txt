 A series of mono- and divalent fluorinated pyridine derivatives is investigated by electrospray ionization ( tandem) mass spectrometry and quantum chemical calculations with respect to their capability to bind anions in the gas phase. The pyridine derivatives differ not only in valency , but also with regard to the degree of fluorination of the pyridine rings , the positions of the fluorine atoms , the rigidity of the spacers connecting the two pyridines in the divalent compounds , and the relative configuration. While the monovalent compounds did not form anion complexes , the divalent analogues exhibit anion binding even to weakly coordinating anions such as tetrafluoroborate. Three different tandem mass spectrometric experiments were applied to rank the gas-phase binding energies: ( i) collision-induced dissociation ( CID) experiments in a Fourier transform ion-cyclotron-resonance ( FTICR) mass spectrometer on two different , simultaneously mass-selected complexes with different receptors , ( ii) determination of the collision energy required to fragment 50 % of the mass-selected complexes in an ESI-QToF mass spectrometer , and ( iii) CID of heterodimers formed from two different , competing pyridine receptors and indigo carmine , a dianion with two identical binding sites. All three experiments result in consistent binding energy ranking. This ranking reveals surprising features , which are not in agreement with binding through anion-π interactions. Density functional theory ( DFT) calculations comparing different potential binding modes provide evidence that the ranking can instead nicely be explained , when C-H ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ anion interactions with the spacers are invoked. These results are supported by gas-phase IR spectroscopy and ion mobility-mass spectrometry ( IM-MS) on a selected set of chloride pyridine complexes.
