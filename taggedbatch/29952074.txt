 Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> is a common causative bacterium<pathogen> of acute and chronic<disease> infections<disease> that have been responsible for high mortality over the past decade. P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> produces many virulence factors such as toxins , enzymes and dyes that are strongly dependent on quorum sensing ( QS) signaling systems. P.<pathogen> aeruginosa has three major QS systems ( las , rhl and Pseudomonas quinolone signal) that regulate the expression of genes encoding virulence factors as well as biofilm production and maturation. Antimicrobial blue light ( aBL) is considered a therapeutic option for bacterial infections and has other benefits , such as reducing bacterial virulence. Therefore , this study investigated the efficacy of aBL to reduce P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> pathogenicity. aBL treatment resulted in the reduced activity of certain QS signaling molecules in P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> and inhibited biofilm formation. in vivo tests using a Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> infection model indicated that sublethal aBL decreased the pathogenicity of P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen>. aBL may be a new virulence-targeting therapeutic approach.
