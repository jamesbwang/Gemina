 HPV-related and HPV-unrelated oropharyngeal<disease> squamous cell carcinomas are two distinct entities according to the Union for International Cancer Control , with a better prognosis conferred to HPV-related oropharyngeal<disease> squamous cell carcinomas. However , variable clinical outcomes are observed among patients with p16 positive oropharyngeal<disease> squamous cell carcinoma , which is a surrogate marker of HPV infection. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of RNA CISH against E6 and E7 transcripts ( HPV RNA CISH) to predict such variability. We retrospectively included 50 histologically confirmed p16 positive oropharyngeal<disease> squamous cell carcinomas ( p16 positive immunostaining was defined by a strong staining in 70 % or more of tumor cells). HPV RNA CISH staining was assessed semi-quantitatively to define two scores: RNA CISH `` low '' and RNA CISH `` high ''. Negative HPV RNA CISH cases were scored as RNA CISH `` low ''. This series contained 29 RNA CISH low cases ( 58 %) and 21 RNA CISH high cases ( 42 %). Clinical and pathologic baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. RNA CISH high staining was associated with a better overall survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses ( p = 0.033 and p = 0.042 , respectively). Other recorded parameters had no prognostic value. In conclusion , HPV RNA CISH might be an independent prognostic marker in p16 positive oropharyngeal<disease> squamous cell carcinomas and might help guide therapeutics.
