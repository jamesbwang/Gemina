 Whey protein hydrolysates ( WPH) were prepared from whey protein concentrate ( WPC) by partial or extensive hydrolysis. WPC and two WPH types were characterized by a descriptive sensory analysis. WPC exhibited a `` milky '' , `` sweet '' , and `` mild milk fat '' odor , whereas extensively hydrolyzed whey protein ( E-WPH) demonstrated `` cheese-like '' , `` acrid odor '' , and `` sour '' olfactory characteristics. In E-WPH , 3- ( methylthio)- propanal , phenylacetaldehyde , and 3-methylbutanoic acid were specifically detected with high flavor dilution factors upon aroma extract dilution analysis. These odor-active compounds likely contributed to the olfactory characteristics of E-WPH , and their concentration increased together with that of their respective putative precursors: free methionine , phenylalanine , and leucine.
