 Nanoalloys with anisotropic morphologies of branched and porous internal structures show great promise in many applications as high performance materials. Reported synthetic approaches for branched alloy nanostructures are , however , limited by the synthesis using a seed-growth process. Here , we demonstrate a conveniently fast and one-pot solution-phase thermal reduction strategy yielding nanoalloys of Pt with various solute feed ratios , exhibiting hyperbranched morphologies and good dispersity. When Pt was alloyed with transition metals ( Ni , Co , Fe) , we observed well-defined dendritic nanostructures in PtNi , PtCo and Pt ( NiCo) , but not in PtFe , Pt ( FeNi) or Pt ( FeCo) due to the steric hindrance of the trivalent Fe ( acac) ₃ precursor used during synthesis. In the case of Pt-based nanoalloys containing Ni and Co , the dendritic morphological evolution observed was insensitive to large variations in solute concentration. The functionality of these nanoalloys towards the oxygen reduction reaction ( ORR); however , was observed to be dependent on the composition , increasing with increasing solute content. Pt ₃ ( NiCo) ₂ exhibited superior catalytic activity , affording about a five- and 10-fold enhancement in area-specific and mass-specific catalytic activities , respectively , compared to the standard Pt/C nanocatalyst. This solution-based synthetic route offers a new approach for constructing dendritic Pt-based nanostructures with excellent product yield , monodispersity and high crystallinity.
