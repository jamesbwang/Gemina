 Plaque psoriasis affects approximately 2 % to 3 % of the global population , with psoriatic arthritis<disease><symptom> observed in approximately 20 % to 30 % of these individuals. Upon advances in research pathophysiology and treatment over the past decade , biologic therapies have been used more to treat moderate<symptom> to severe psoriasis. In Canada , reimbursement bodies have defined prior authorization criteria to determine patient eligibility for funding of biologic treatments in moderate<symptom> to severe plaque psoriasis. Generally , patients will have been treated with conventional therapies such as topical steroids , phototherapy , or systemic treatments such as methotrexate and cyclosporine before starting a biologic therapy. In difficult cases or severe flares in otherwise controlled disease , practitioners may augment the regimen with one or more conventional treatments. The objective of this observational report was to identify treatment pathways for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis<disease><symptom> patients in Canada by examining initial biologic treatment and subsequent treatment optimization patterns for informed reimbursement discussions and decisions. A retrospective chart review was conducted at Newlab Clinical Research using medical records of patients who received at least 1 of 4 biologic agents approved at that time of the survey in Canada for the treatment of plaque psoriasis ( adalimumab , etanercept , infliximab , ustekinumab). The study population consisted of patients who had moderate<symptom> to severe plaque psoriasis , diagnosed by a dermatologist , for at least 6 months before the study index date and who attended Newlab Clinical Research between 2008 and 2013. All current and previous agents prescribed for the treatment of psoriasis were captured. A total of 248 patients with psoriasis treated with biologics were identified , of whom 27 ( 10.9 %) were also diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis<disease><symptom>. Prior to initiating treatment with a biologic , most patients ( 72.1 %) were treated with ( or contraindicated to) methotrexate/cyclosporine. Treatment was supplemented with topical agents ( 70.6 %) and/or followed by a course of ultraviolet light phototherapy ( 51.6 %). Only 2.4 % of patients were treated with a biologic first. Of 248 patients treated with biologics , almost half ( 47.6 %) needed add-on therapy , whereas 16.5 % of patients had an increase in dose or dosing interval. Furthermore , 14.1 % of patients added a topical agent , 10.5 % a topical steroid , or 6.5 % a course of phototherapy while continuing biologic therapies. Finally , 30.4 % of patients switched to another biologic treatment. Adalimumab was the most common agent used as a second-line agent ( 37.2 %) , and patients who started on adalimumab mainly switched to ustekinumab as a second-line agent ( 73.9 %). Infliximab was the agent least often used as second-line therapy.
