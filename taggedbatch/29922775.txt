 We apply X-ray magnetic circular dichroism to study the internal magnetic structure of two very promising star shaped macrocyclic complexes with a CuII3TbIII core. These complexes are rare examples prepared with a macrocyclic ligand that show indications of SMM ( Single Molecule Magnet) behavior , and they differ only in ring size: one has a propylene linked macrocycle , ( CuII3TbIII ( LPr) ( NO3) 2 ( MeOH) ( H2O) 2) ( NO3) · 3H2O ( nickname: Cu3Tb ( LPr)) , and the other has the butylene linked analogue , ( CuII3TbIII ( LBu) ( NO3) 2 ( MeOH) ( H2O)) ( NO3) · 3H2O ( nickname: Cu3Tb ( LBu)). We analyze the orbital and spin contributions to the Cu and Tb ions quantitatively by applying the spin and orbital sum rules concerning the L2 ( M4)/ L3 ( M5) edges. In combination with appropriate ligand field simulations , we demonstrate that the Tb ( iii) ions contribute with high orbital magnetic moments to the magnetic anisotropy , whereas the ligand field determines the easy axis of magnetization. Furthermore , we confirm that the Cu ( ii) ions in both molecules are in a divalent valence state , the magnetic moments of the three Cu ions appear to be canted due to 3d-3d intramolecular magnetic interactions. For Cu3Tb ( LPr) , the corresponding element specific magnetization loops reflect that the Cu ( ii) contribution to the overall magnetic picture becomes more important as the temperature is lowered. This implies a low value for the 3d-4f coupling.
