 Multidrug resistance ( MDR) in leukemia<disease> cells is a major obstacle to chemotherapeutic treatment. High expression and constitutive activation of multidrug resistance protein 1 ( MRP1) has been associated with the development of resistance to anticancer drugs in a number of tumor types. The activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 ( JNK1) is associated with the occurrence of MDR and MRP1 expression. The present study aimed to investigate the ability of solanine to resensitize the Adriamycin
