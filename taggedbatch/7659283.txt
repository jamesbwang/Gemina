 Microglia have been shown to be of critical importance to the progression of temporal lobe epilepsy. However , the broad transcriptional changes that these cells undergo following seizure<symptom> induction is not well understood. As such , we utilized RNAseq analysis upon microglia isolated from the hippocampus to determine expression pattern alterations following kainic acid induced seizure<symptom>. We determined that microglia undergo dramatic changes to their expression patterns , particularly with regard to mitochondrial activity and metabolism. We also observed that microglia initiate immunological activity , specifically increasing interferon beta responsiveness. Our results provide novel insights into microglia transcriptional regulation following acute<symptom> seizures<symptom> and suggest potential therapeutic targets specifically in microglia for the treatment of seizures<symptom> and epilepsy.
