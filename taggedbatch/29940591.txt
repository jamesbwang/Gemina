 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage , resulting in extremely poor 5-year survival. Late diagnosis of PDAC is mainly due to lack of a reliable method of early detection. Carbohydrate antigen ( CA) 19-9 is often used as a tumor biomarker in PDAC; however , the test lacks sensitivity and specificity. Therefore , new sensitive and minimally invasive diagnostic tools are required to detect pancreatic cancer. Here , we investigated circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA) which contained KRAS-mutated as a potential diagnostic tool for PDAC patients who underwent irreversible electroporation ( IRE). We used droplet digital polymerase chain reaction ( ddPCR) to detect the expression of KRAS-mutated genes in plasma samples of 65 PDAC patients who underwent IRE. In these 65 cases , ctDNA was detected in 20 ( 29.2 %) samples. The median overall survival ( OS) was 11.4 months with ctDNA + patients and 14.3 months for ctDNA- patients. ctDNA + patients had a obviously poorer prognosis associated to overall survival ( P < 0.001). Our results suggested that the existence of ctDNA was a predictor of survival for PDAC patients. Therefore , ctDNA may be a new sensitive biomarker for monitoring treatment outcome in PDAC.
