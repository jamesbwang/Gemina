 Kyphoplasty has been widely used to treat vertebral compression fractures ( VCFs). In standard procedure of kyphoplasty , two balloons were inserted into the vertebral body through bipedicular and inflated simultaneously , while using a single balloon two times is also a common method in clinic to lessen the financial burden of patients. However , the effect and safety of single balloon versus double balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty are still controversy. In this systematic review and meta-analysis , eligible studies were identified through a comprehensive literature search of PubMed , Cochrane library EMBASE , Web of Science , Wanfang , CNKI , VIP and CBM until January 1 , 2018. Results from individual studies were pooled using a random or fixed effects model. Seven articles were included in the systematic review and five studies were consisted in meta-analysis. We observed no significant difference between single balloon and double balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty in visual analog scale ( VAS) , angle ( kyphotic angle and Cobb angle) , consumption ( operation time , cement volume and volume of bleeding) , vertebral height ( anterior height , medium height and posterior height) and complications ( cement leakage and new VCFs) , while the cost of single balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is lower than that of double balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty. The results of our meta-analysis also demonstrated that single balloon can significantly improve the VAS , angle and vertebral height of patients suffering from VCFs. This systematic review and meta-analysis collectively concludes that single balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is as effective as double balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty in improving clinical symptoms , deformity and complications of VCFs but not so expensive.
