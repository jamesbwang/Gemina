 The past decade has witnessed tremendous progress in soft robotics. Unlike most pneumatic-based methods , we present a new approach to soft robot design based on precharged pneumatics ( PCP). We propose a PCP soft bending actuator , which is actuated by precharged air pressure and retracted by inextensible tendons. By pulling or releasing the tendons , the air pressure in the soft actuator is modulated , and hence , its bending angle. The tendons serve in a way similar to pressure-regulating valves that are used in typical pneumatic systems. The linear motion of tendons is transduced into complex motion via the prepressurized bent soft actuator. Furthermore , since a PCP actuator does not need any gas supply , complicated pneumatic control systems used in traditional soft robotics are eliminated. This facilitates the development of compact untethered autonomous soft robots for various applications. Both theoretical modeling and experimental validation have been conducted on a sample PCP soft actuator design. A fully untethered autonomous quadrupedal soft robot and a soft gripper have been developed to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over traditional pneumatic-driven soft robots.
