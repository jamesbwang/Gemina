 Adaptive motor control is premised on the principle of movement minimization , which in turn is premised on a form of sensorimotor memory. But what is the nature of this memory and under what conditions does it operate? Here , we test the limits of sensorimotor memory in an intermanual context by testing the effect that the action performed by the left hand has on subsequent right hand grasps. Target feature-overlap predicts that sensorimotor memory is engaged when task-relevant sensory features of the target are similar across actions; partial effector-overlap predicts that sensorimotor memory is engaged when there is similarity in the task-relevant effectors used to perform an action; and the action-goal conjunction hypotheses predicts that sensorimotor memories are engaged when the action goal and the action type overlap. In three experiments , participants used their left hand to reach out and pick up an object , manually estimate its size , pinch it , look at it , or merely rest the left hand before reaching out to pick up a second object with their right hand. The in-flight anticipatory grip aperture of right-hand grasps was only influenced when it was preceded by grasps performed by the left-hand. Overlap in the sizes of the objects , partial overlap in the effectors used , and in the availability of haptic feedback bore no influence on this metric. These results support the hypothesis that intermanual transfer of sensorimotor memory on grasp execution is dependent on a conjunction of action type and goal.
