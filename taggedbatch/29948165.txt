 The purpose of this study was: ( A) to establish the effects of different ultrasound measurement methods ( linear versus curved array) and measuring conditions ( impact of pressure by fetal head/pelvis on the lower uterine segment ( LUS)) during LUS-muscular-thickness measurement , ( B) to introduce the intraoperative ultrasound measurement of LUS-muscular thickness ( reference measurement method) , and ( C) to evaluate the correlation between different combinations of LUS-muscular-thickness measurement ultrasound techniques at birth planning and preoperative versus intraoperative measurements. A prospective clinical observational study of women with the previous cesarean delivery was conducted. LUS-muscular thickness was measured: first at birth planning and second preoperatively using linear and curved probes ( transabdominal) and an endocavitar probe ( transvaginal) , examined with and without pressure by fetal head/pelvis on LUS during measurement and third intraoperatively during repeat cesarean. Bland-Altman plots , paired t tests , Pearson 's correlation coefficient , and scatter plots were used. Thirty-three women were included in the study ( ultrasound measurements: n = 601). There was no systematic difference between LUS-muscular-thickness measurements with linear versus curved array ( mean difference = 0.06 mm; p = 0.24; n The systematic application of predetermined measuring conditions , standardized setup criteria improves the performance of LUS thickness measurement by ultrasound near term.
