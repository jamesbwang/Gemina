 Although water and sanitation are considered human rights , worldwide approximately three of 10 people ( 2.1 billion) do not have access to safe drinking water. In 2016 , 5.6 million students were enrolled in the 34 % of Brazilian schools located in rural areas , but only 72 % had a public water supply network. The objective was to evaluate effectiveness of environmental intervention for water treatment in rural schools of the Western Amazonia , and determine the efficacy of water treatment using a simplified chlorinator on potability standards for turbidity , fecal coliforms and A simplified chlorinator was installed for treatment of potable water in 20 public schools in the rural area of Rio Branco municipality , Acre state , Brazil. Before the intervention , 20 % ( This intervention considerably improved schools ' water quality , thus decreasing children 's health vulnerability due to inadequate water. Ancillary activities including training , educational lectures , installation of equipment , supply of materials and supplies ( 65 % calcium hypochlorite and reagents) were considered fundamental to achieving success full outcomes. Installation of a simplified chlorinator in rural schools of the Western Amazon is therefore proposed as a social technology aiming at social inclusion , as well as economic and environmental sustainability.
