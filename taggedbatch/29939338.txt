 Inhibitory failure represents a core dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia ( SP) , which has predominantly been tested in the literature using reactive ( ie , altering behavior after a stimulus) rather than proactive ( ie , purposefully changing behavior before a stimulus) response inhibition tasks. The current study replicates/extends our previous findings of SP exhibiting sensorimotor cortex ( SMC) hyperactivity and connectivity abnormalities in independent samples of patients and controls. Specifically , 49 clinically well-characterized SP and 54 matched healthy controls ( HC) performed a proactive response inhibition task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging and resting-state data collection. Results indicated that the majority of SP ( 84 %) and HC ( 88 %) successfully inhibited all overt motor<symptom> responses<symptom> following a cue , eliminating behavioral confounds frequently present in this population. Observations of left SMC hyperactivity during proactive response inhibition , reduced cortical connectivity with left SMC , and increased connectivity between left SMC and ventrolateral thalamus were replicated for SP relative to HC in the current study. Similarly , negative symptoms ( eg , motor retardation) were again associated with SMC functional and connectivity abnormalities. In contrast , findings of a negative blood oxygenation level-dependent response in the SMC of HC did not replicate. Collectively , current and previous findings suggest that SMC connectivity abnormalities may be more robust relative to evoked hemodynamic signals during proactive response inhibition. In addition , there is strong support that these SMC abnormalities are a key component of SP pathology , along with dysfunction within other sensory cortices , and may be associated with certain clinical deficits such as negative symptoms.
