 The caecal microbiota plays a key role in chicken health and performance , influencing digestion and absorption of nutrients , and contributing to defence against colonisation by invading pathogens. Measures of productivity and resistance to pathogen colonisation are directly influenced by chicken genotype , but host driven variation in microbiome structure is also likely to exert a considerable indirect influence. Here , we define the caecal microbiome of indigenous Indian Aseel and Kadaknath chicken breeds and compare them with the global commercial broiler Cobb400 and Ross 308 lines using 16S rDNA V3-V4 hypervariable amplicon sequencing. Each caecal microbiome was dominated by the genera Bacteroides<pathogen> , unclassified bacteria , unclassified Clostridiales , Clostridium , Alistipes , Faecalibacterium , Eubacterium<pathogen> and Blautia. Geographic location ( a measure recognised to include variation in environmental and climatic factors , but also likely to feature varied management practices) and chicken line/breed were both found to exert significant impacts ( p < 0.05) on caecal microbiome composition. Linear discriminant analysis effect size ( LEfSe) revealed 42 breed-specific biomarkers in the chicken lines reared under controlled conditions at two different locations. Chicken breed-specific variation in bacterial occurrence , correlation between genera and clustering of operational taxonomic units indicate scope for quantitative genetic analysis and the possibility of selective breeding of chickens for defined enteric microbiota.
