 The aim of this study was to investigate the association of trace element and toxic metal concentrations in blood and the outcome of in vitro fertilization ( IVF). The study included 104 consecutive patients that underwent assisted reproductive technology ( ART) procedures. The following parameters were determined: cadmium ( Cd) , mercury ( Hg) , arsenic ( As) , and lead ( Pb); and copper ( Cu) , zinc ( Zn) , selenium ( Se) , and magnesium ( Mg). Serum samples were obtained before commencing stimulation. Patients with smoking habit had significantly higher Pb concentrations ( P = 0.022) , as well as higher concentrations of As and Hg but not significantly. All subjects were divided into groups of pregnant and nonpregnant patients. Pregnant patients had lower mean values of Mg ( P = 0.009) , As ( P < 0.05) , and Pb ( P = 0.034) , compared to nonpregnant , and a significant correlation between pregnancy outcome and concentrations of Mg , Cd , and Pb was found. Women who had had delivered had lower Mg ( P = 0.009) and Cd ( P = 0.014) concentrations. There was a significant correlation of the negative outcome of IVF procedure with higher concentrations of Pb ( P = 0.046) and Cd ( P = 0.012). In conclusion , our results suggest that there is a difference in Mg , Pb , and Cd concentrations between pregnant and nonpregnant women. There was no association between toxic metals and number and quality of oocytes and embryos , while there was with fertilization rate. Concerning trace elements , we did not find the correlation of trace elements with oocyte number and quality , nor with a number of fertilized oocytes , except for Cu. Patients who were pregnant had lower concentrations of Mg.
