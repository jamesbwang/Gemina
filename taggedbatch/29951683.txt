 Hybrid organic-inorganic and all-inorganic metal halide perovskites have been one of the most intensively studied materials during the last few years. In particular , research focusing on understanding how to tune the photoluminescence features and to apply perovskites to optoelectronic applications has led to a myriad of new materials featuring high photoluminescence quantum yields covering the whole visible range , as well as devices with remarkable performances. Having already established their successful incorporation in highly efficient solar cells , the next step is to tackle the challenges in solid-state lighting ( SSL) devices. Here , the most prominent is the preparation of white-emitting devices. Herein , we have provided a comprehensive view of the route towards perovskite white lighting devices , including thin film light-emitting diodes ( PeLEDs) and hybrid LEDs ( HLEDs) , using perovskite based color down-converting coatings. While synthesis and photoluminescence features are briefly discussed , we focus on highlighting the major achievements and limitations in white devices. Overall , we expect that this review will provide the reader a general overview of the current state of perovskite white SSL , paving the way towards new breakthroughs in the near future.
