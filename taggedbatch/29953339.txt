 This study compared light transmission through different thicknesses of bulk-fill resin-based composites ( RBCs) using a polywave and a single-peak light-emitting diode light-curing unit ( LCU). The effect on the surface hardness was also evaluated. Five bulk-fill RBCs were tested. Specimens ( n = 5) of 1- , 2- , 4- , or 6-mm thickness were photopolymerized for 10 seconds from the top using a polywave ( Bluephase Style) or single-peak ( Elipar S10) LCU , while a spectrophotometer monitored in real time the transmitted irradiance and radiant exposure reaching the bottom of the specimen. After 24 hours of storage in distilled water at 37 °C , the Vickers microhardness ( VH) was measured at top and bottom. Results were analyzed using multiple-way analysis of variance , Tukey post hoc tests , and multivariate analysis ( α = 0.05). The choice of LCU had no significant effect on the total amount of light transmitted through the five bulk-fill RBCs at each thickness. There was a significant decrease in the amount of light transmitted as the thickness increased for all RBCs tested with both LCUs ( p < 0.001). Effect of LCU on VH was minimal ( η The total amount of light transmitted through the five bulk-fill RBCs was similar at the different thicknesses using either LCU. The polywave LCU used in this study did not enhance the polymerization of the tested bulk-fill RBCs when compared with the single-peak LCU.
