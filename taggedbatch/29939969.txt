 The current review summarizes the importance of taste perception with regard to acceptance of oral nutritional supplements ( ONS) in young children. We also shed light on how basic tastes may influence the orosensory detection of ONS in the light of genetic variations , encoding for different taste modalities , particularly for sweet and bitter ( and fat) , in children. Single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) of bitter and sweet taste receptor genes , that is , respectively , TAS2R38 and T1R2/T1R3 , may influence orosensory perception of ` bitter-made-sweet ' ONS. The SNP of fat taste receptor gene , that is , CD36 , might communicate with bitter taste perception. The emerging new sixth fat taste may interfere with obesity in children. Sweet and bitter taste modalities are innate cues , expressed by children from birth to adolescence , either by a strong preference or by food aversion. Sweet and bitter tastes also communicate with each other as sweeteners can mask bitter phenotype. The fat preference , encoded by specific lingual taste receptors , is also modulated , via its interaction with phenotype and genotype , by bitter taste. Sodium salts might interact with bitter taste. Finally , the taste modalities will impact on the intake of ONS in children as the taste phenotype changes in this population , irrespective to genotype.
