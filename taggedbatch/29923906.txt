 At our institution , breast cancer cases that generate an equivocal HER2/neu ( HER2) result by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) using the dual HER2/chromosome enumeration probe ( CEP17) are reflexed to an assay that utilizes an alternative control probe ( lissencephaly gene1 ( LIS1) ( 17p13 .3)/ retinoic acid receptor Î± ( RARA) ( 17q21 .2)). This study examines whether cancers that are classified as HER2-amplified with an alternate probe are clinicopathologically similar to those that are classified as such using the HER2/CEP17 probe. Reports for 1201 breast cancers were reviewed , and clinicopathologic findings were compared between HER2/CEP17-equivocal cases that became HER2-amplified using the alternate probe ( group A: n = 48) , HER2-amplified cases using the HER2/CEP17 probe ( group B: n = 169) , and HER2-nonamplified cases using the HER2/CEP17 probe ( group C: n = 910). Of 1201 cases tested using the HER2/CEP17 probe , 169 ( 14 %) were HER2-amplified , 122 ( 10 %) were equivocal , and 910 ( 76 %) were nonamplified. Additional testing with the alternative probe on the 122 equivocal cases reclassified 48 ( 39 %) of them to HER2-amplified , and such cases comprised 22 % of all HER2-amplified tumors. A higher proportion of tumors with HER2 copy number between 5.0 and 5.9 became positive upon additional testing when compared with those with a priori HER2 copy numbers between 4.0 and 4.9 ( P = 0.0362). Group A cases , compared with group B cases , were more frequently positive for estrogen receptor ( 97.91 % vs. 72.18 % , P < 0.0001) and progesterone receptor ( 85.41 % vs. 59.17 % , P = 0.0009). Most group A cases ( 71 %) were HER2 equivocal ( score 2 +) by immunohistochemistry , whereas most group B cases ( 60 %) were positive ( score 3 +). Groups A and B showed no significant differences regarding patient age , lymph node status , tumor grade , histotype , and stage distribution. In summary , among our HER2-amplified cohort of breast cancers , alternative probe-detected cases were more frequently estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positive than HER2/CEP17-detected cases , and were more frequently discordant with HER2 immunohistochemistry results. These findings raise the possibility of underlying biologic differences between these 2 groups , which warrants further study. However , the tumors were largely comparable regarding all other clinicopathologic variables. As it is unknown whether HER2-targeted therapy is truly beneficial in this subgroup of patients , future clinical trials should specifically evaluate this subset.
