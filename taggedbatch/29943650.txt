 Mortality from invasive fungal<disease> disease<disease> involving the central nervous system ( CNS) is excessive. Achieving therapeutic drug concentrations at the site of infection within the CNS is always difficult and its evaluation is complex due to anatomical barriers and variable pathophysiological lesions<symptom>. Areas covered: This review provides an updated summary of the CNS PK of antifungal therapies. It considers factors that influence the success of antifungal regimens for CNS infection as well as preclinical and clinical data that quantify antifungal pharmacokinetics ( PK) in the CNS. Furthermore , it presents state-of-the-art technologies to enhance the clinical use of existing antifungal drugs , and introduces novel antifungal drugs in development. Expert opinion: The antifungal drugs currently available are either suboptimal , or are being used suboptimally , for CNS disease. Therapeutic drug monitoring is mandatory to enhance their effectiveness. Novel drugs in development may offer more efficacious options. In all cases , contemporary technologies to assess CNS PK offer the opportunity to enhance our understanding and use of antifungal drugs for CNS fungal<disease> disease<disease>.
