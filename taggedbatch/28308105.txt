 Ricinus<pathogen> communis<pathogen> L. colonizes heterogeneous urban landscapes as monospecific thickets. The ecological understanding on colonization success of R.<pathogen> communis population due to variable light availability is lacking. Therefore , to understand the effect of intrinsic light heterogeneity on species ' population dynamics , R.<pathogen> communis populations exposed to variable light availability ( low , intermediate , and high) were examined for performance strategies through estimation of key vegetative , eco-physiological , biochemical , and reproductive traits. Considerable variability existed in studied plant traits in response to available light. Individuals inhabiting high-light conditions exhibited high eco-physiological efficiency and reproductive performance that potentially confers population boom. Individuals exposed to low light showed poor performance in terms of eco-physiology and reproduction , which attribute to bust. However , individuals in intermediate light were observed to be indeterminate to light availability , potentially undergoing trait modulations with uncertainty of available light. Heterogeneous light availability potentially drives the boom and bust cycles in R.<pathogen> communis<pathogen> monospecific thickets. Such boom and bust cycles subsequently affect species ' dominance , persistence , collapse , and/or resurgence as an aggressive colonizer in contrasting urban environments. The study fosters extensive monitoring of R.<pathogen> communis thickets to probe underlying mechanism ( s) affecting expansions and/or collapses of colonizing populations.
