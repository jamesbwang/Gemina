 The Standard Joint Unit ( 1 SJU = 7 mg of 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol) simplifies the exploration of risky patterns of cannabis use. This study proposes a preliminary quantitative cutoff criterion to screen for cannabis use disorder ( CUD). Socio-demographical data and information on cannabis quantities , frequency of use , and risk for CUD ( measured with the Cannabis Abuse Screening Test ( CAST) of cannabis users recruited in Barcelona ( from February 2015 to June 2016) were collected. CAST scores were categorized into low , moderate , and high risk for CUD , based on the SJU consumed and frequency. Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) analysis related daily SJU with CUD. Participants ( n = 473) were on average 29 years old ( SD = 10) , men ( 77.1 %) , and single ( 74.6 %). With an average of 4 joints per smoking day , 82.5 % consumed cannabis almost every day. Risk for CUD ( 9.40 % low , 23.72 % moderate , 66.88 % high) increased significantly with more frequency and quantities consumed. The ROC analyses suggest 1.2 SJU per day as a cutoff criterion to screen for at least moderate risk for CUD ( sensitivity 69.4 % , specificity 63.6 %). Frequency and quantity should be considered when exploring cannabis risks. A 1 SJU per day is proposed as a preliminary quantitative-based criterion to screen users with at least a moderate risk for CUD.
