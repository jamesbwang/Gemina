 Violent injury places a large burden on the NHS. We had implemented information sharing in our ED in 2007 and aimed to see which patient groups were most affected by information sharing , as this would provide clues as to how this complex intervention works. Retrospective time series study of all the assault victims presenting for ED care between 2005 and 2014 at a single ED in England. 10 328 patients presented during the study period. There was a 37 % decrease in the number of patients presenting after assault , consistent with national trends. The proportions of people arriving by ambulance , and the proportion of men did not change during the study period. There were no important changes in the age of our assault patients in this study. Greater , disproportionate , decreases in rates of violence were seen in patients who presented at the weekend up ( incidence rate ratio ( IRR) = 0.57 , 95 % CI 0.50 to 0.64) versus weekdays ( IRR = 0.72; 95 % CI 0.62 to 0.83) There were also disproportionately greater decreases over the study period in patients who were discharged with no hospital follow-up ( IRR = 0.51 , 95 % CI 0.45 to 0.56) versus those leading to either an inpatient admission ( IRR = 1.05 , 95 % CI 0.84 to 1.31) or outpatient follow-up ( IRR = 1.23 , 95 % CI 0.93 to 1.64). The epidemiology of violent injury at our institution has changed over the last 10 years and is most marked in a reduction of visits at the weekend , and in those who leave without follow up.
