 Evidence to demonstrate the prevalence and trend of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA) infection in Nigeria is scarce. This review evaluates the prevalence , trend and antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical MRSA isolates reported in published studies. Electronic search ( PubMed , Scopus and Google scholar) was conducted using the following search terms: `` MRSA OR Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> AND Nigeria. '' Reference list of selected studies was scanned to identify more studies. Studies published between 2007 and 2017 that tested at least 30 non-duplicate S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> isolates were selected. An independent reviewer extracted data from the studies using a standardized form. Twelve studies were included in this review. Overall , prevalence of MRSA infection increased from 18.3 % ( 2009) to 42.3 % ( 2013). The prevalence of MRSA infection was less than 50 % in all the regions during the period under review. There was a decline in the prevalence of MRSA infection in the North-East ( from 12.5 % to 8.0 %) between 2007 and 2012 , and an increase in the South-West ( from 20.2 % to 47.4 %) between 2006 and 2010. Wound<disease><symptom> , blood and urine specimens had the highest proportion of MRSA isolates. Non-susceptibility of MRSA strains to cotrimoxazole and tetracycline was greater than 85 %. Prevalence of MRSA infection in Nigeria is rising , albeit regional variations. Non-susceptibility to commonly prescribed , orally available and inexpensive antibiotics was high. Antimicrobial resistance surveillance system , infection control , and antimicrobial stewardship interventions are recommended.
