 The long-term incidence of acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease><symptom> has been reported to be declining in Europe and North<pathogen> America. Recent reports , however , indicate stabilized or even increased rates. The aim of this study was to investigate the present epidemiology of acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease><symptom> and appendicectomy in a population-based cohort of Swedish children. The Swedish National Patient Register was queried for all children with acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease><symptom> and/or appendicectomy in 1987-2013. Population-based incidence rates were calculated. Rates were age- and sex-adjusted , and analysed for temporal and regional trends. Some 56 774 children with acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease><symptom> were identified , of whom 53 478 ( 94 · 2 per cent) underwent appendicectomy. The incidence rate of acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease><symptom> declined by 43 · 7 per cent over 26 years , from 177 · 7 to 100 · 1 per 100 000 person-years between 1987 and 2013. The most significant reduction was for non-perforated appendicitis<disease><symptom> , from 138 · 5 to 68 · 4 per 100 000 person-years between 1987 and 2009. The incidence rate of perforated appendicitis<disease><symptom> decreased from 28 · 0 to 19 · 9 per 100 000 person-years and negative appendicectomies reduced from 48 · 5 to 3 · 6 per 100 000 person-years during the study interval. The incidence rates of acute<symptom> appendicitis<disease><symptom> and negative appendicectomy have reduced markedly in Swedish children over time , with significantly different trends amongst non-perforated appendicitis<disease><symptom> and perforated appendicitis<disease><symptom>. The full explanation for the observed findings is unclear.
