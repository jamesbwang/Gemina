 The realization of asymmetric hollow carbonaceous nanostructures remains a great challenge , especially when biomass is chosen as the carbon resource through hydrothermal carbonization ( HTC). Herein , a simple and straightforward solvent-induced buckling strategy is demonstrated for the synthesis of asymmetric spherical and bowl-like carbonaceous nanomaterials. The formation of the bowl-like morphology was attributed to the buckling of the spherical shells induced by the dissolution of the oligomers. The bowl-like particles prepared through this solvent-driven approach demonstrated a well-controlled morphology and a uniform particle size of approximately 360 nm. The obtained nanospheres and nanobowls were loaded with CoS
