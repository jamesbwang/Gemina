 Background Our hospital organization raised the possibilities of outsourcing their sterile pediatric chemotherapy preparations to another hospital conditional on analyzing the potential hazardous events that need to be anticipated. Methods The study was conducted by a multidisciplinary working group from September 2015 to January 2016 with the support of a risk manager. A list of hazardous situations that could occur during outsourcing process was assessed. First , a map of hazardous situations was developed by crossing outsourcing processes divided into phases classified as critical or not. Second , a map of risk was established by crossing potential consequences of these hazardous situations and elaborating corrective actions to reduce the initial risks. Results The map of hazardous situations identified 183 relevant hazardous situations , 78 of which were considered high priority and 154 scenarios were developed. Slightly more than half of these hazardous situations concerned information system ( 30 %) , human resources ( 14 %) , and management ( 11 %). The generic hazards of information system and human generated 37 ( 24 %) and 41 ( 27 %) scenarios , respectively. To reduce critical risks , 33 corrective actions were proposed. Working time required was estimated at 35 days. The subcontractor personnel for this new organization included an estimated extra time of 0.7-pharmacist working day and 1.4-pharmacy dispenser working day. Conclusions The preliminary hazard analysis method appeared to apply to our system of outsourcing sterile cytotoxic preparations in another hospital. Regardless , this analysis is complex and requires time and expertise.
