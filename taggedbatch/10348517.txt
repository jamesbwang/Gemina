 The gingiva is part of the periodontium supporting structures surrounding the teeth and commonly involved in gingival and periodontal conditions. Assessing the distribution of gingival lesions<symptom> is important for evaluating the prevalence of periodontal<disease> disease<disease> in the population to optimize the oral health care services. The purpose of this study is to report the frequency and distribution of gingival lesions<symptom> biopsied from 1996-2016. This cross-sectional retrospective study retrieved data from all gingival lesions<symptom> biopsied from 1996-2016 and sent to the King Abdulaziz University Dental Hospital oral pathology laboratory. Histologic sections were reviewed in a blinded manner by a certified oral pathologist to confirm the initial histologic diagnosis. Of the 1,248 oral-maxillofacial lesions<symptom> , 119 ( 9.5 %) gingival lesions<symptom> were diagnosed. The mean age was 41.58 years. Gingival lesions<symptom> were more prevalent in female patients than male patients ( 53.8 %). The most common diagnoses were reactive lesions<symptom> ( 41.2 %). Pyogenic granuloma<disease> was the predominant lesion<symptom> in the category ( n = 26 , 21.8 %) , and followed by inflammatory conditions ( 24.4 %) , benign neoplasm ( 9.2 %) , malignant neoplasm ( 7.6 %) , epithelial lesions<symptom> ( 7.6 %) , miscellaneous ( 5 %) , and immune-mediated diseases ( 5 %). Squamous cell carcinoma was the only malignant neoplasm reported ( 7.6 %; mean age , 57.44 years) and more common in male than female patients ( 2:1). Most biopsies were sent from oral and maxillofacial surgeons ( 55.6 %) followed by general dentists ( 22.2 %) and periodontists ( 12.8 %). Pyogenic granuloma<disease> was the most common gingival lesion<symptom>. Squamous cell carcinoma was the only malignant lesion<symptom> in which histologic examination was the definitive diagnostic measure. This study provides information about the frequencies and distributions of gingival lesions<symptom> over 20 years.
