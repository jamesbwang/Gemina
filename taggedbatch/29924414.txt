 Antibiotic-loaded calcium sulfate beads ( CS-B) are used to treat biofilm-related periprosthetic joint infections ( PJI). A previous study has shown that such beads are effective in reducing lawns biofilms grown on agar plates; however , the ability of CS-B to eradicate biofilms grown on solid orthopedic material surfaces has not been investigated. We grew biofilms of bioluminescent strains of Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> Xen41 and a USA300 MRSA Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> SAP231 on ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene ( PE) , hydroxyapatite ( HA) , and 316L stainless steel ( SS) coupons for three days under static growth conditions , with daily nutrient exchange. The coupons were rinsed with sterile phosphate buffered saline ( PBS) to remove planktonic bacteria and placed in a petri dish , surrounded by four either antibiotic vancomycin and tobramycin loaded ( CS-B
