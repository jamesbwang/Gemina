 For the last two and a half decades , a network of human health experts under the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program ( AMAP) has produced several human health assessment reports. These reports have provided a base of scientific knowledge regarding environmental contaminants and their impact on human health in the Arctic. These reports provide scientific information and policy-relevant recommendations to Arctic governments. They also support international agreements such as the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants ( POPs) and the Minamata Convention on Mercury. Key topics discussed in this paper regarding future human health research in the circumpolar Arctic are continued contaminant biomonitoring , health effects research and risk communication. The objective of this paper is to describe knowledge gaps and future priorities for these fields.
