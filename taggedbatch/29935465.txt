 Passive sampling with in situ devices offers several advantages over traditional sampling methods ( i.e. , discrete spot sampling) , however , data interpretation from conventional passive samplers is hampered by difficulties in estimating the thickness of the diffusion layer at the sampler/medium interface ( δ) , often leading to inaccurate determinations of target analyte concentrations. In this study , the performance of a novel device combining active and passive sampling was investigated in the laboratory. The active-passive sampling ( APS) device is comprised of a diffusion cell fitted with a pump and a flowmeter. Three receiving phases traditionally used in passive sampling devices ( i.e. , chelex resin , Oasis HLB , and silicone rubber) , were incorporated in the diffusion cell and allowed the simultaneous accumulation of cationic metals , polar , and non-polar organic compounds , respectively. The flow within the diffusion cell was accurately controlled and monitored , and , combined with diffusion coefficients measurements , enabled the average δ to be estimated. Strong agreement between APS and time-averaged total concentrations measured in discrete water samples was found for most of the substances investigated. Accuracies for metals ranged between 87 and 116 % , except Cu and Pb ( ∼ 50 %) , whilst accuracies between 64 and 101 % , and 92 and 151 % were achieved for polar and non-polar organic compounds , respectively. These results indicate that , via a well-defined in situ preconcentration step , the proposed APS approach shows promise for monitoring the concentration of a range of pollutants in water.
