 In very-elderly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL) patients , treatment intensities must be lowered due to the risks of comorbidities and organ function deterioration , and treatment outcomes are worse compared to younger patients. Very-elderly patients are often excluded from DLBCL clinical trials , and optimal treatments and dosages are not established. In this clinical trial , we examined the efficacy and safety of 6 courses of R-mini CHP therapy ( cf. , CHOP ( cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisone)) in which vincristine is omitted to avoid the peripheral neuropathy that reduces elderly patients ' quality of life , as remission induction therapy in DLBCL patients aged â‰¥ 80 years.
