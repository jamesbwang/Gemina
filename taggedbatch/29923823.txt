 Enterococcus<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> is commonly found as a commensal gut bacteria , but some linages have caused increasing extra-gastrointestinal infections. In particular , strains with high-level virulence or antimicrobial resistance are prevalent in healthcare settings as nosocomial pathogens. This study was performed to elucidate the epidemiological characteristics and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of E.<pathogen> faecalis causing nosocomial infections in a Chinese general hospital over a 4-year period. We collected 77 isolates causing extra-gastrointestinal infections from patients at 14 different wards in a tertiary hospital from 2011 to 2014. The population relationship was assessed by multilocus sequence typing and multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was used to evaluate susceptibility against 11 antimicrobial agents. The isolates showed high-level resistance to tetracycline ( 86.5 %) , erythromycin ( 78.4 %) , rifampin ( 62.2 %) , etc.. The major clonal complexes ( CCs) included CC4 , CC16 and CC21. As the most dominant subtype , CC16 was identified in almost all of the wards and all types of samples , but the isolation rate decreased continually. In contrast , the isolation rates of CC4 and CC21 increased and the proportion of these two CCs in 2014 was more than three times that in 2011. In addition , CC4 showed higher resistance than CC16. This study demonstrated the prevalent subtypes and resistance profiles of E.<pathogen> faecalis causing nosocomial infection , and indicated that CC4 may be a newly emerging high-risk , multi-resistant cluster. More surveillance is urgently needed , which will increase our understanding of the prevention and treatment of such infections.
