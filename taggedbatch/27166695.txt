 Due to the high similarity in their requirements for space and food , close bacterial relatives may be each other 's strongest competitors. Close bacterial relatives often form visible boundaries to separate their swarming colonies , a phenomenon termed colony-merger incompatibility. While bacterial species are known to have many incompatible strains , it is largely unclear which traits lead to multiple incompatibilities and the interactions between multiple incompatible siblings. To investigate the competitive interactions of closely related incompatible strains , we mutated
