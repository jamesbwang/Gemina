 Physical activity is considered an effective measure to promote health in older people. There is evidence that the number of outdoor trips increases physical activity by increasing walking duration. The objective of this study was to analyse the relationship between daily time out-of-home and walking duration. Furthermore , predictors for walking duration and time out-of-home were evaluated. Walking duration was measured prospectively over a 1 week period by a body-fixed sensor and the time out-of-home was assessed by a questionnaire at the same days. Seven thousand , two hundred and forty-three days from 1289 older people ( mean age 75.4 years) with both sensor-based measures and completed questionnaires were included in the analyses. To account for several observation days per participant multilevel regression analyses were applied. Analyses were stratified according to the time out-of-home ( more or less than 100 min/day). In the group with less than 100 min out-of-home , each additional minute out-of-home added 20 s to overall walking duration. If the time exceeded 100 min the additional increase of walking duration was only moderate or weak. Leaving the home once added 40 min of walking , the following trips 15 to 20 min. Increasing age , lower gait speed , comorbidities , low temperature , rain and specific week days ( Sunday) decreased both the time out-of-home and walking duration. Other variables like gender ( female) , isolation or living with a spouse reduced the time out-of-home without affecting walking duration. Being out-of-home increases daily walking duration. The association is strongest if the time out-of-home is 100 min or less.
