 Necrotising fasciitis<disease> ( NF) is an infrequent yet significant complication of primary varicella infection in immunocompetent children. We report a case of a 4-year-old girl who presented three days into her chicken pox illness , with a rapidly progressing , severely tender erythematous rash<symptom> surrounding one chicken pox lesion<symptom> on her thigh. She required intravenous antibiotics , two surgical debridements , a skin graft and a prolonged stay in the paediatric intensive care unit , but ultimately we were able to save her life and limb. NF is a rare complication of chicken pox that has high morbidity and mortality that requires prompt and specific treatment.
