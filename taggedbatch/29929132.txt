 Omethoate , an organophosphorous pesticide , can cause a variety of health effects , especially the decrease of cholinesterase activity. The aim of this study is to explore the association of genetic polymorphisms of telomere binding proteins with cholinesterase activity in omethoate-exposed population. Cholinesterase activities in whole blood , red blood cell and plasma were detected using acetylthiocholine and dithio-bis- ( nitrobenzoic acid) method; Genetic Genotyping of POT1 rs1034794 , POT1 rs10250202 , TERF1 rs3863242 and TERT rs2736098 were performed with PCR-RFLP. The cholinesterase activities of whole blood , red blood cells and plasma in exposure group are significantly lower than that of the control group ( P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicates that exposure group ( b =- 1.016 , P < 0.001) , agender ( b = 0.365 , P < 0.001) , drinking ( b = 0.271 , P = 0.004) and TERF1rs3863242 ( b =- 0.368 , P = 0.016) had an impact on cholinesterase activities. The results suggest that individual carrying AG+GG genotypes in TERF1 gene rs3863242 polymorphism were susceptible to damage in cholinesterase induced by omethoate.
