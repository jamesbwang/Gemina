 The aim of this study was to determine the type of medial longitudinal arch ( MLA) in students of Krakow universities , investigate the relationship between physical activity and the shaping of the feet , and examine the relationship between hallux valgus angle and the type of footwear chosen most often. The study group consisted of 120 students , of which 56 respondents were students of the University School of Physical Education in Krakow , whereas the remaining 64 respondents were students of the Pedagogical University of Krakow. To evaluate the MLA , a podoscope was used , which allowed us to determine the length and width of the foot , and calculation of the Clarke angle , heel angle Î³ , and the angle of hallux valgus. All students were also subjected to a measurement of body<symptom> weight and height. There was a statistically significant relationship between physical activity and the Clarke angle in the group of women studying at the University School of Physical Education. There was no correlation between the hallux valgus angle and the type of footwear chosen most often in the research groups. The most frequently diagnosed type of longitudinal and transverse arch foot in the research group was normal MLA. There was no relationship between physical activity and transverse arch foot in any of the research groups.
