 Reactions of 3,7-diacetyl-1,3,7-triaza-5-phosphabicyclo ( 3.3.1) nonane ( DAPTA) with metal salts of Cu ( II) or Na ( I)/ Ni ( II) under mild conditions lead to the oxidized phosphane derivative 3,7-diacetyl-1,3,7-triaza-5-phosphabicyclo ( 3.3.1) nonane-5-oxide ( DAPTA =O) and to the first examples of metal complexes based on the DAPTA =O ligand , ( CuII ( κ-CH3COO) 2 ( κO-DAPTA =O)) 2 ( 1) and ( Na ( 1κOO '; 2κO-DAPTA =O) ( MeOH)) 2 ( BPh4) 2 ( 2). The catalytic activity of 1 was tested for Henry reaction , as well as for the aerobic TEMPO-mediated oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Compound 1 has also been evaluated as a model system for the catechol oxidase enzyme using 3,5-di-tert-butyl-catechol ( 3,5-dtbc) as the substrate. The kinetic data fitted the Michaelis-Menten equation and enabled obtaining a rate constant for the catalytic reaction which are among the highest obtained for this substrate using dinuclear Cu ( II) complexes. DFT calculations discard a bridging mode binding type of this substrate and propose a mixed-valence Cu ( II)/ Cu ( I) complex intermediate where the spin electron density is mostly concentrated at one of the Cu atoms and at the organic ligand.
