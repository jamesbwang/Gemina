 Severe<symptom> hemorrhage<symptom> remains the leading cause of death among trauma patients. Resuscitative balloon occlusion of the aorta ( REBOA) is an endovascular alternative to the established emergency room thoracotomy with cross-clamping of the aorta in patients with severe<symptom> abdominal or pelvic bleeding. The article reports on initial experiences with REBOA. Based on the literature and own experiences the pathophysiology , indications , contraindications , technical details and first results with REBOA are presented. The REBOA procedure is indicated in patients with treatment-refractive hemorrhagic shock<symptom> with severe<symptom> abdominal or pelvic bleeding. Via a transfemoral approach a balloon catheter is placed in the aorta and inflated. Depending on the indication the aortic occlusion is located in a supradiaphragmatic ( zone 1) or infrarenal ( zone 3) position. Experimental results proved a significant increase in central perfusion pressure after performance of REBOA. Furthermore , first clinical data indicate an improved patient survival rate after trauma. Improvements of the devices and minimizing the access trauma using small 7 Fr sheaths decreased the perioperative complication rate. The REBOA procedure is a promising endovascular technique for temporary stabilization of the circulation in patients with hemorrhagic shock<symptom>. Further clinical studies and registries have yet to prove its superiority over emergency room thoracotomy.
