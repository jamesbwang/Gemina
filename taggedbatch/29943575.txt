 Despite some recent developments on the portable on-site sensor of Aflatoxin B1 ( AFB1) , the complex and expensive preparation of recognition elements have still limited their wide applications. In this paper , using the fast , low-cost , and stable recognition of aptamer DNA-AFB1 , a portable aptasensor was constructed for the on-site detection of AFB1 in food matrixes , with the readout of personal glucose meter ( PGM) and DNA walking machine for signal probe separation. In such an assay protocol , the target could trigger the DNA walker to autonomously move on the electrode surface , propelled by unidirectional Pb
