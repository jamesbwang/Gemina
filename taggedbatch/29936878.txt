 Deregulation of the fibroblast growth factor ( FGF)/ FGF receptor ( FGFR) network occurs frequently in tumors due to gene amplification , activating mutations , and oncogenic fusions. Thus , the development of FGF/FGFR-targeting therapies is the focus of several basic , preclinical , and clinical studies. Areas covered: This review will recapitulate the status of current FGF/FGFR-targeted drugs. Expert commentary: Non-selective FGF/FGFR inhibitors have been approved for cancer treatment but evidence highlights various complications affecting their use in the clinical practice. It appears mandatory to identify FGF/FGFR alterations and appropriate biomarkers that may predict and monitor response to treatment , to establish the contribution of the FGF/FGFR system to the onset of mechanisms of drug resistance , and to develop effective combinations of FGF/FGFR inhibitors with other targeted therapies.
