 Currently , cucumber cultivation is mainly through monoculture , as continuous culture leads to the decrease of crop yield and soil quality. In order to improve soil quality to achieve continuous monocultures , soil physicochemical properties , microbial biomass , content of phenolic compounds , and the size of bacterial , fungal , ammonia-oxidizing bacteria ( AOB) , and Fusarium<pathogen> oxysporum<pathogen> were first evaluated in cucumber monoculture solar greenhouse. Soil improvement technology , including catch wheat ( CW) , calcium cyanamide disinfection ( LN) , and straw reactor technology ( SR) during summer fallow period , was compared with conventional fallow ( CK). Results showed that CW , LN , and SR all significantly increased soil pH , and LN and SR increased soil electrical conductivity ( EC); however , CW decreased soil EC. Meanwhile , LN increased soil available N content significantly and SR increased available P content significantly. CW had negative effect on the accumulation of soil available nutrients , conversely , CW and SR had positive effect on the accumulation of microbial biomass carbon ( MBC). All the treatments increased the total phenol content in the soil compared with CK. While CW increased the size of bacteria , AOB in the soil inhibited fungal and wilt pathogen size. LN also increased the size of soil bacteria and reduced the size of fungi<pathogen>. The comprehensive evaluation of all treatments showed that CW could control soil nutrient loss and improve the continuous cropping soil , making the soil transform from fungi<pathogen> to bacteria type. All the treatments accelerate the accumulation of phenolic compound , while whether or not developing autotoxicity requires further investigation.
