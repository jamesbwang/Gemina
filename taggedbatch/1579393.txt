 The frequency of injuries sustained while playing on inflatable toys such as bouncy castles have rapidly increased. These supposedly safe structures are likely unsafe. The objective of this review was to investigate the risk that these attractions represent and the necessary measures to minimize risk of accidents. We conducted a prospective study of 114 patients over a period of one year ( 2015 to 2016). Demographic data collected included: age , gender , anatomical location and side of involvement as well as supervision of the child whilst on the bouncy castle. The extracted data include mechanism of injury and risk factors , i.e. lack of supervision of the child , amounts of users jumping at the same time. The injuries were slightly more frequent in male than female children; 2:1 up to six years of age. From the age of ten to 14 years the ration evened to 1:1 , the higher incidence in female children was between the ages of six to eight years.The most common injuries were to the humerus , followed by the distal radius. Only 28 % of the parents said they were supervising while the child was jumping. Injuries associated with inflatable bouncers have increased over time. The main risk factors: were lack of effective adult supervision and the shared use by an excessive number of participants of different ages and weights.These considerations lead to the conclusion that there is a necessity to enhance child health surveillance and to consider limiting bouncer usage to children over the age of six years , to prevent and control injuries and to minimize their consequences.
