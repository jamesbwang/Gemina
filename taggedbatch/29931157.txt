 The SRB-2 aptamer originally selected against sulforhodamine B is shown here to promiscuously bind to various dyes with different colors. Binding of SRB-2 to these dyes results in either fluorescence increase or decrease , making them attractive for fluorescence microscopy and biological assays. By systematically varying fluorophore structural elements and measuring dissociation constants , the principles of fluorophore recognition by SRB-2 were analyzed. The obtained structure-activity relationships allowed us to rationally design a novel , bright , orange fluorescent turn-on probe ( TMR-DN) with low background fluorescence , enabling no-wash live-cell RNA imaging. This new probe improved the signal-to-background ratio of fluorescence images by one order of magnitude over best previously known probe for this aptamer. The utility of TMR-DN is demonstrated by imaging ribosomal and messenger RNAs , allowing the observation of distinct localization patterns in bacteria and mammalian cells. The SRB-2/ TMR-DN system is found to be orthogonal to the Spinach/DFHBI and MG/Malachite green aptamer/dye systems.
