 Abies religiosa forests in central Mexico are the only overwinter refuge of the monarch butterfly and provide important ecosystem services. These forests have lost 55 % of their original area and as a consequence , diversity and biotic interactions in these ecosystems are in risk. The aim of this study was to compare the soil fungal diversity and community structure in the Abies religiosa forests and surrounding Pinus montezumae , Pinus hartwegii , and coniferous mixed forest<disease> plant communities to provide data on ecology of mycorrhizal interactions for the assisted migration of A. religiosa. We sampled soil from five coniferous forests , extracted total soil DNA , and sequenced the ITS2 region by Illumina MiSeq. The soil fungi<pathogen> community was integrated by 1746 taxa with a species turnover ranging from 0.280 to 0.461 between sampling sites. In the whole community , the more abundant and frequent species were Russula sp. ( aff. olivobrunnea) , Mortierella<pathogen> sp. 1 , and Piloderma sp. ( aff. olivacearum). The ectomycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> were the more frequent and abundant functional group. A total of 298 species ( 84 ectomycorrhizal) was shared in the five conifer forests; these widely distributed species were dominated by Russulaceae and Clavulinaceae. The fungal community composition was significantly influenced by altitude and the lowest species turnover happened between the two A. religiosa forests even though they have different soil types. As Pinus montezumae forests have a higher altitudinal distribution adjacent to A. religiosa and share the largest number of ectomycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> with it , we suggest these forests as a potential habitat for new A. religiosa populations.
