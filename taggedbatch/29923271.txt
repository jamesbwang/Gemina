 Inhibitory control is the stopping of a mental process with or without intention , conceptualized as mental suppression of competing information because of limited cognitive capacity. Inhibitory control dysfunction is a core characteristic of many major psychiatric disorders. Inhibition is generally thought to involve the prefrontal cortex; however , a single inhibitory mechanism is insufficient for interpreting the heterogeneous nature of human cognition. It remains unclear whether different dimensions of inhibitory processes-specifically cognitive inhibition , response inhibition , and emotional interference-rely on dissociated neural systems. We conducted systematic meta-analyses of fMRI studies in the BrainMap database supplemented by PubMed using whole-brain activation likelihood estimation. A total of 66 study experiments including 1,447 participants and 987 foci revealed that while the left anterior insula was concordant in all inhibitory dimensions , cognitive inhibition reliably activated specific dorsal frontal inhibitory system , engaging dorsal anterior cingulate , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , and parietal areas , whereas emotional interference reliably implicated a ventral inhibitory system , involving the ventral surface of the inferior frontal gyrus and the amygdala. Response inhibition showed concordant clusters in the fronto-striatal system , including the dorsal anterior cingulate region and extended supplementary motor areas , the dorsal and ventral lateral prefrontal cortex , basal ganglia , midbrain regions , and parietal regions. We provide an empirically derived dimensional model of inhibition characterizing neural systems underlying different aspects of inhibitory mechanisms. This study offers a fundamental framework to advance current understanding of inhibition and provides new insights for future clinical research into disorders with different types of inhibition-related dysfunctions.
