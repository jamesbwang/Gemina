 Critical limb ischemia ( CLI) remains a challenge for an interdisciplinary therapeutic team due to chronic nonhealing wounds<disease><symptom>. Against this background , there is a necessity of quality control after revascularization. Beside the isolated evaluation of the macrocirculation by Ankle-Brachial or Toe-Brachial Index measurements , the microcirculation as an additional important factor of wound<disease><symptom> healing often remains underestimated. The following article gives an overview about the current investigation methods for noninvasive perfusion control of the CLI patient. Therefore , transcutaneous oxygen pressure ( tcpO
