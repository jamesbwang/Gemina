 Recently , sparse representation , which relies on the underlying assumption that samples can be sparsely represented by their labeled neighbors , has been applied with great success to image classification problems. Through sparse representation-based classification ( SRC) , the label can be assigned with minimum residual between the sample and its synthetic version with class-specific coding , which means that the coding scheme is the most significant factor for classification accuracy. However , conventional SRC-based coding schemes ignore dependency among the samples , which leads to an undesired result that similar samples may be coded into different categories due to quantization sensitivity. To address this problem , in this paper , a novel approach based on self-supervised sparse representation is proposed for image classification. In the proposed approach , the manifold structure of samples is firstly exploited with low rank representation. Next , the low-rank representation matrix is used to characterize the similarity of samples in order to establish a self-supervised sparse coding model , which aims to preserve the local structure of codings for similar samples. Finally , a numerical algorithm utilizing the alternating direction method of multipliers ( ADMM) is developed to obtain the approximate solution. Experiments on several publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.
