 We describe a case of unilateral acne which appeared after an episode of facial<symptom> nerve palsy. An 18-year-old female patient presented with papules and pustules<symptom> predominantly located on the side where the facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom> occurred. The patient suffered right facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom> , which was treated with prednisone and kinesiotherapy with massages , electrostimulation , and infrared light. Two weeks later , acne lesions<symptom> appeared in the area affected by the paralysis. As suggested in other cases of paralysis , including cases of Parkinson 's disease and spinal<disease> cord injury , an increased sebum excretion rate and the immobility of the affected area are most likely what caused the unilateral acne lesions<symptom>.
