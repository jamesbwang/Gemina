 The management of isolated in-breast tumor recurrence is complex , requiring careful consideration of prior local therapies to plan future multimodality treatment. Options for surgical management have evolved from standard salvage mastectomy with axillary clearance and now include repeat breast conservation with axillary staging in select patients. Reattempting sentinel lymph node biopsy may avoid the morbidity of extensive axillary surgery and has been shown to be feasible in clinically node-negative patients with oncologically safe outcomes. In the adjuvant setting , partial breast irradiation has emerged as a valuable means to improve local control rates with limited associated toxicity and acceptable overall cosmesis. Furthermore , results from prospective trials are now available to support the use of chemotherapy in hormone-receptor negative subgroups , which is associated with improvements in long-term , disease-free , and overall survival.
