 To determine the publication rate of abstracts presented at the Japan Primary Care Association Annual Meetings and the factors associated with publication. A retrospective observational study. All abstracts presented at the Japan Primary Care Association Annual Meetings ( 2010-2012). Publication rates were determined by searching the MEDLINE database for full-text articles published by September 2017. Data on presentation format ( oral vs poster) , affiliation of the first author , number of authors , number of involved institutions , journal of publication and publication date were abstracted. Of the 1003 abstracts evaluated , 38 ( 3.8 % , 95 % CI 2.6 % to 5.0 %) were subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals indexed in the MEDLINE database. The median time to publication was 15.5 months ( IQR , 9.3-29.3 months). More than 95 % of published abstracts were published within 4 years. The publications appeared in 23 different journals ( 21 English-language journals and two Japanese-language journals). Based on univariate analysis using binary logistic regression , publication was more frequent for oral presentations ( 7.3 % vs2 .0 % for poster presentations; OR 3.91,95 % CI 1.98 to 7.75) , and for first authors affiliated with university-associated institutions ( 6.4 % vs2 .4 % for first authors affiliated with non-university-associated institutions; OR 2.75,95 % CI 1.42 to 5.30). Based on multivariate analysis , oral presentation and first author affiliation with a university-associated institution were still the only independent predictive factors for publication ( adjusted OR 3.50 ( 95 % CI 1.72 to 7.12) and adjusted OR 2.35 ( 95 % CI 1.19 to 4.63) , respectively). Even among 151 abstracts presented orally by first authors affiliated with a university-associated institution , only 18 abstracts ( 11.9 %) were subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals. The publication rate of abstracts presented at the Japan Primary Care Association Annual Meetings was extremely low. Further studies are warranted to investigate the barriers to publication among investigators who participate in conferences where the publication rate is extremely low.
