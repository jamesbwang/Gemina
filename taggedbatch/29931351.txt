 Calcineurin B-like proteins ( CBLs) act as Ca2 + sensors to activate specific protein kinases , CBL-interacting protein kinases ( CIPKs). Recent research has demonstrated that the CBL-CIPK complex is not only required for abiotic stress signaling , but also is likely involved in biotic stress perception. However , the role of this complex in immune signaling , including pathogen perception , is lacking. In this study , we isolated one signaling component of the TaCBL-TaCIPK complex ( TaCBL4-TaCIPK5) and characterized the role in the interaction between wheat and Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici<pathogen> ( Pst). Among all TaCBLs in wheat , TaCBL4 mRNA accumulation markedly increased after infection by Pst. Silencing of TaCBL4 resulted in enhanced susceptibility to the avirulent Pst infection. In addition , TaCIPK5 was screened out to physically interact with TaCBL4 in planta and positively contributed to wheat resistance to Pst. Moreover , the disease resistance phenotype of TaCBL4 and TaCIPK5 co-silenced plants was consistent with that of single knockdown plants. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) was significantly altered in all silencing plants during Pst infection. Together these findings demonstrate that the TaCBL4-TaCIPK5 complex positively modulates wheat resistance in a ROS-dependent manner. Our work provides new insights for understanding the roles of CBL-CIPK in wheat.
