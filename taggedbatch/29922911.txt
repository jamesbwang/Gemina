 Handgrip strength is strongly related to muscle power in the extremities and is an important index for diagnosing sarcopenia. We evaluated the relationship between handgrip strength and quality of life ( QoL) in Korean men and women. We analyzed 4620 participants ( 2070 men and 2550 women) using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey VI-3 ( 2015). Low handgrip strength was defined as the lower quartile of handgrip strength in the study population. QoL was evaluated according to the European Quality of Life Scale-Five Dimensions ( EQ-5D). The relationship between handgrip strength and QoL was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analyses. The odds ratios ( ORs) for low handgrip strength significantly increased as age increased for both men and women. The ORs for low handgrip strength increased as body mass index decreased in men. In men with low handgrip strength , the OR for having problems in mobility ( OR 1.93 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.25-2.98) and having pain or discomfort ( 1.53 , 1.04-2.24) significantly increased. In women with low handgrip strength , the OR for having problems in mobility ( 2.12 , 1.02-2.87) , problems in usual activities ( 2.04 , 1.46-2.85) , and having pain or discomfort ( 1.48 , 1.15-1.90) significantly increased. Men with low handgrip strength had poor QoL on the mobility and pain/discomfort dimensions of EQ-5D , whereas women with low handgrip strength had poor QoL on mobility , usual activities , and pain/discomfort dimensions. Management to improve handgrip strength is necessary for achieving better QoL.
