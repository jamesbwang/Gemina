 Currently , a blood test for the diagnosis of endometriosis , a common estrogen-dependent gynecological disease , does not exist. Recent studies suggest that circulating concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) have potential for the diagnosis of endometriosis. However , at present , BDNF can only be measured by ELISA , which requires a clinic visit , a routine blood sample , and laboratory testing. Therefore , we developed a point-of-care device ( EndoChip) for use with small blood volumes that can be collected through a finger prick. Specifically , the presented device is a polymer-based chip with a nanoporous , wrinkled gold film acting as the electrode/sensing layer , allowing for the electrochemical detection of BDNF in plasma. Increasing concentrations of BDNF ( 0.1-2.0 ng/mL) induced significant differences in redox current. The biosensor produces a signal readout in a matter of seconds , and is ideal for realizing multiplexing. Blood samples were collected from women ( n = 20) with chronic<disease> pelvic pain undergoing a diagnostic laparoscopy. Plasma BDNF concentrations measured by commercial ELISA were positively correlated ( r
