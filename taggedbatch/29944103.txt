 In this study , non-invasive early stage diagnosis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus-related pneumonia<disease> and related anti-inflammatory profiles with theranostic platforms were reported. Mesoporous silica NPs were first synthesized and chemically modified to bear an amino group and further covalently bind to amino-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalic acid and anti-methicillin-resistant S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> antibodies. The drug-loaded NPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy , dynamic light scattering analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectra. MTT and broth dilution assays were used to investigate the biocompatibility and antibacterial potency of the platform. In vivo computed tomography analysis was performed in rats infected with different kinds of pneumonia<disease> , and anti-inflammatory studies such as bronchoalveolar lavage and pathological assays were used to test the capability of our nanomedicine as a theranostic platform. In addition , the long-term safety of the hybrid NPs was investigated via hematological and biochemical assays.
