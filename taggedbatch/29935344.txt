 MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) of the miR-17-92 cluster are overexpressed in human cancers , and their enforced expression is tumorigenic in mouse models. A number of genes are reported to be targets of these miRNAs and are implicated in their tumorigenic potential. However , the mode of action by miRNAs suggests that global analysis of their targets is required to understand their cellular roles. In this study , we globally analyzed AGO2-bound mRNAs and found that the miR-17-92 miRNAs coherently repress multiple targets involved in the destabilization of mRNA. While the miRNAs repress the expression of their targets , they increase stability and lengthen the poly-A tails of non-target mRNAs. Furthermore , the expression of BTG3 , TOB1 , CSNK1A1 and ANKRD52 is negatively correlated with the expression of the miR-17-92 cluster in cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that the miR-17-92 miRNAs promote tumorigenesis not only by repression of key regulators , but also by posttranscriptional increases of global gene expression.
