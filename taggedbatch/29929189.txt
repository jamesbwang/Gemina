 Ketamine inhibits the proliferation of neural stem cells ( NSCs) and disturbs normal neurogenesis. Dexmedetomidine provides neuroprotection against volatile anesthetic-induced neuroapoptosis and cognitive impairment in the developing brain. Whether it may protect NSCs from ketamine-induced injury remains unknown. In this study , we investigated the protective effects of dexmedetomidine on ketamine-exposed NSCs and explored the mechanisms potentially involved. Primary NSC cultures were characterized using immunofluorescence. Cell viability was determined using a Cell Counting Kit 8 assay. Proliferation and apoptosis were assessed with BrdU incorporation and TUNEL assays , respectively. Protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 , phosphorylated protein kinase B ( p-Akt) , and glycogen synthase kinase-3β ( p-GSK-3β) were quantified using western blotting. Ket-amine significantly decreased NSC viability and proliferation and increased their apoptosis. Dexmedetomidine increased NSC proliferation and decreased their apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore , dexmedetomidine pretreatment notably augmented the viability and proliferation of ketamine-exposed NSCs and reduced their apoptosis. Moreover , dexmedetomidine lessened caspase-3 activation and increased p-Akt and p-GSK-3β levels in NSCs exposed to ketamine. The protective effects of dexmedetomidine on ketamine-exposed NSCs could be partly reversed by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Collectively , these findings indicate that dexmedetomidine may protect NSCs from ketamine-induced injury via the PI3K/Akt/GSK -3 β signaling pathway.
