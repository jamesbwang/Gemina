 To examine the role of members of the NHS England Youth Forum ( NHSEYF) and the strategies used to influence health service provision for children and young people. An evaluative mixed-methods study was commissioned by NHS England and undertaken by the University of Hertfordshire between July 2015 and September 2016. Data collection comprised activity logs , a form of questionnaire , and semi-structured interviews. The analysis of the activity logs revealed that the young people were undertaking a wide range of activities across England. Seven themes emerged from the interviews: the young people; motivation; commitment; community ( the local area as well as a community spirit); knowledge experts; youth workers; and funding. In summary , the members of the NHSEYF were committed to their role and their work was having a positive effect on health service provision. The NHSEYF has developed rapidly and successfully. It is enabling the voice of young people to be heard.
