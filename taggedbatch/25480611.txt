 Learning of surgical procedures is traditionally based on a master-apprentice model. Segmenting procedures into steps is commonly used to achieve an efficient manner of learning. Existing methods of segmenting procedures into steps , however , are procedure-specific and not standardized , hampering their application across different specialties and thus worldwide uptake. The aim of this study was to establish consensus on the step-by-step framework for standardizing the segmentation of surgical procedures into steps. An international expert panel consisting of general , gastrointestinal and oncological surgeons was approached to establish consensus on the preciseness , novelty , usefulness and applicability of the proposed step-by-step framework through a Delphi technique. All statements were rated on a five-point Likert scale. A statement was accepted when the lower confidence limit was 3 路 00 or more. Qualitative comments were requested when a score of 3 or less was given. In round one , 20 of 49 experts participated. Eighteen of 19 statements were accepted; the ` novelty ' statement needed further exploration ( mean 3 路 05 , 95 per cent c.i. 2 路 45 to 3 路 65). Based on the qualitative comments of round one , five clarifying statements were formulated for more specific statements in round two. Twenty-two experts participated and accepted all statements. The international expert panel consisting of general , gastrointestinal and oncological surgeons supported the preciseness , usefulness and applicability of the step-by-step framework. This framework creates a universal language by standardizing the segmentation of surgical procedures into step-by-step descriptions based on anatomical structures , and may facilitate education , communication and assessment.
