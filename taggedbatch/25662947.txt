 Multimorbidity , polypharmacy , and older age predispose seniors to adverse drug events ( ADE). Seniors with an ADE experience greater morbidity , mortality , and health care utilization compared to their younger counterparts. To mitigate and manage ADEs among this vulnerable population , we designed a geriatric pharmacology consultation service connecting clinicians with specialist physicians and pharmacists and will investigate the feasibility and acceptability of this complex intervention in the long-term care setting , prior to conducting a larger efficacy trial. We will conduct a cluster randomized feasibility trial and qualitative analysis of GeriMedRisk among four long-term care homes in the Waterloo-Wellington region from May 1 to December 31 , 2017. The primary outcome is the feasibility and acceptability of GeriMedRisk and the stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial design. We hypothesize that GeriMedRisk is a feasible intervention and its potential to decrease falls and drug-related hospital visits can be evaluated with a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial design. This mixed methods study will inform a larger efficacy trial of GeriMedRisk 's ability to decrease adverse drug events among seniors in the long-term care setting. The Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board granted the approval for this study protocol 2812. We plan to disseminate the results of this study in peer-reviewed journals and also to our partners and stakeholders. ISRCTN clinical trials registry , ISRCTN17219647 ( March 27 , 2017).
