 Suspensions of small planktonic copepods represent a special category in the realm of active matter , as their size falls within the range of colloids , while their motion is so complex that it can not be rationalized according to basic models of self-propelled particles. Indeed , the wide range of individual variability and swimming patterns resemble the behaviour of much larger animals. By analysing hundreds of three-dimensional trajectories of the planktonic copepod Clausocalanus furcatus , we investigate the possibility of detecting how the motion of this species is affected by different external conditions , such as the presence of food and the effect of gravity. While this goal is hardly achievable by direct inspection of single organism trajectories , we show that this is possible by focussing on simple average metrics commonly used to characterize colloidal suspensions , such as the mean square displacement and the dynamic correlation functions. We find that the presence of food leads to the onset of a clear localization that separates a short-time ballistic from a long-time diffusive regime. Such a benchmark reflects the tendency of C. furcatus to remain temporally feeding in a limited space and disappears when food is absent. Localization is clearly evident in the horizontal plane , but is negligible in the vertical direction , due to the effect of gravity. Our results suggest that simple average descriptors may provide concise and useful information on the swimming properties of planktonic copepods , even though single organism behaviour is strongly heterogeneous.
