 We aimed to investigate the efficacy of peracetic acid ( EndoPA We prospectively investigated the gastroscopes ( Part I) utilized in 100 gastroscopic examinations and colonoscopes ( Part II) utilized in 30 colonoscopic examinations after disinfecting them with 0.2 % peracetic acid ( EndoPA In Part I of our study , two of 300 samples were positive. The culture positive rate after disinfection was 0.7 % ( 2/300). The culture positive rate was not significantly different based on the exposure time to EndoPA We conclude that 0.2 % peracetic acid ( EndoPA
