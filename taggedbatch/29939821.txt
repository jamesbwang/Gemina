 Anxiety<symptom> disorders are a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson 's disease ( PD) with a reported prevalence ranging from 20 % to 50 %. Although anxiety<symptom> is associated with Parkinson 's disease , anxiety<symptom> disorders can begin before the onset of motor<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , and have been linked to a possible abnormality of dopaminergic , serotonergic , and adrenergic neurons that precedes motor disturbance. Area covered: Several studies have reported the pharmacological treatment of depression<symptom> in PD , but none have been randomized clinical trials with a primary outcome measure of anxiety<symptom>. Two trials showed that pharmacological intervention with tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors proved beneficial in treating anxiety<symptom> in PD. However , the effect size was modest. Anxiety<symptom> is associated with off-periods and improved by L-Dopa , especially in patients with high levels of anxiety<symptom>. Expert opinion: Decreasing off-periods is important for managing anxiety<symptom> in patients with motor<symptom> fluctuations<symptom>. Minor suggestive data indicate that tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be helpful with modest effect sizes , but the former can cause additional side effects. Only one study has examined the use of benzodiazepines to treat anxiety<symptom> in PD , and benzodiazepines can not be recommended because they increase the risk of falling. Further clinical studies for pharmacological intervention against anxiety<symptom> are required.
