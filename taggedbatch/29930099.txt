 To document the difference between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic refraction and explore its associated factors in Chinese young adults. A school-based study including 7971 undergraduates was conducted in Anyang , Henan Province , China. Cycloplegia was achieved with two drops of 1 % cyclopentolate and 1 drop of Mydrin P ( Tropicamide 0.5 % , phenylephrine HCl 0.5 %) with a 5 min interval. Non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic refractions were measured by an autorefractor. A paired-sample t-test and Spearman correlation analysis were used for analysis with data from only the right eyes included. RESULTS: Of the 7971 students examined , 7793 ( 97.8 %) with complete data were included , aging 20.2 ± 1.5 years. Male students accounted for 36.8 %. Overall , there was a significant difference between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic SE ( spherical equivalent) of 0.83 ± 0.81 D ( p < 0.01). The difference was 1.80 ± 1.11 D , 1.26 ± 0.93 D and 0.69 ± 0.69 D for those with cycloplegic hyperopia , emmetropia and myopia , respectively ( p < 0.01 for all). Those with a hyperopic shift less than 0.25 D and 0.5 D accounted for 11.1 % and 34.1 % , respectively. A significant relationship was found between difference in SE and cycloplegic refraction ( r = 0.33 , b = 0.11 , p < 0.01). Without cycloplegia , prevalence of hyperopia and emmetropia would be underestimated by 6.2 % ( 1.0 % vs 7.2 %) and 5.7 % ( 3.8 % vs 9.5 %) , respectively , with prevalence of myopia and high myopia overestimated by 12.1 % ( 95.3 % vs 83.2 %) and 6.1 % ( 17.2 % vs 11.1 %). CONCLUSION: Lack of cycloplegia will lead to significant misclassification of myopia , emmetropia and hyperopia in Chinese young adults. Cycloplegia is therefore essential for this age-group in epidemiological studies.
