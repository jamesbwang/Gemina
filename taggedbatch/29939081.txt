 Background Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> is the most common heart<symptom> rhythm<symptom> disorder , and high body mass index is a well-established risk factor for atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. The objective of this study was to examine the associations of physical activity and body mass index and risk of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> , and the modifying role of physical activity on the association between body mass index and atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. Design The design was a prospective cohort study. Methods This study followed 43,602 men and women from the HUNT3 study in 2006-2008 until first atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> diagnosis or end of follow-up in 2015. Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> diagnoses were collected from hospital registers and validated by medical doctors. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to assess the association between physical activity , body mass index and atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. Results During a mean follow-up of 8.1 years ( 352,770 person-years) , 1459 cases of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> were detected ( 4.1 events per 1000 person-years). Increasing levels of physical activity were associated with gradually lower risk of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( p trend 0.069). Overweight and obesity were associated with an 18 % ( hazard ratio 1.18 , 95 % confidence interval 1.03-1.35) and 59 % ( hazard ratio 1.59 , 95 % confidence interval 1.37-1.84) increased risk of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> , respectively. High levels of physical activity attenuated some of the higher atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> risk in obese individuals ( hazard ratio 1.53 , 95 % confidence interval 1.03-2.28 in active and 1.96 , 95 % confidence interval 1.44-2.67 in inactive) compared to normal weight active individuals. Conclusion Overweight and obesity were associated with increased risk of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. Physical activity offsets some , but not all , atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> risk associated with obesity.
