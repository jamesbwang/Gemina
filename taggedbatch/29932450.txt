 Next generation Li-ion batteries require improved energy densities , power output and safety to satisfy the demands of emerging technologies. All solid state 3D thin-film batteries ( ASB) based on nanoionics are considered as frontrunners to enable all this. In order to facilitate the introduction of this new architecture , a homogeneous electrochemical activity and a high ionic diffusivity of the electrodes is key. However , nanometer-resolved techniques to probe structural , electrical and electrochemical properties of the battery components are still limited. Here we propose a study that combines conductive atomic force microscopy ( C-AFM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry ( SIMS) for structural and electrical characterization. In addition , a novel concept called ion-modulated C-AFM ( imC-AFM) is introduced to also sense the electrochemical activity of ions in confined volumes. Using the aforementioned methodologies , LixMn2O4 thin film cathodes are studied observing: ( 1) a direct correlation between electrical conductivity and local chemistry. ( 2) A non-uniform Li-ion electrochemical activity ( i.e. ionic conductivity) on the cathode 's surface with a clear enhancement in grain boundaries ( GBs). Finally , ( 3) imC-AFM observes a high volume expansion associated with high Li incorporation. This work introduces a novel pathway for the rapid analysis of materials to be used in ASB.
