 Some phytochemicals have shown the potential of being radiomodifiers , especially phenolic compounds , such as lichenic secondary metabolites. To evaluate the phytochemical usnic acid as a radiomodifier , embryonic cells of molluscs<disease> have been used due to their ease of collection , high sensitivity to physical and chemical agents , well-known embryology and low cost for analysis. This study aimed to assess the radiosensitizing action of usnic acid on Biomphalaria glabrata<pathogen> embryos. Samples were irradiated with 4 Gy of gamma rays from a Irradiation increased the number of non-viable embryos compared to unirradiated controls. Additionally , it was observed that embryos exposed to a non-toxic concentration of usnic acid ( 0.6 Âµg/mL) before irradiation showed a further enhancement in non-viable embryos when compared with exposure to ionizing radiation alone. The results presented here indicate that usnic acid makes cells more sensitive to the damaging effects of radiation.
