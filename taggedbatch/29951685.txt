 A macroring composed of three Cu ( ii) porphyrins ( CuP) and three slipped-cofacial Zn ( ii) porphyrin ( ZnP2) dimers exhibited near-IR emission from the CuP part. The emission lifetime of the macroring ( 15 Î¼s) was 500 times longer compared to that of a Cu porphyrin monomer ( e.g. , Cu ( ii) TPP; TPP = meso-tetraphenylporphyrin). The observed emission is ascribed to emission via the reservoir mechanism from the trip-doublet ( 2T1) state in CuP thermally activated from the T1 state of ZnP2 , which is located ca. 1030 cm-1 below the 2T1 state of CuP. The near-IR emission of the macroring was significantly quenched by O2 , whereas that of the Cu porphyrin monomer was hardly quenched , indicating that the quenching event mainly occurred on the T1 state of the ZnP2 parts. The nonemissive triplet state of a Zn porphyrin at room temperature was visualized through emission from a neighboring Cu porphyrin.
