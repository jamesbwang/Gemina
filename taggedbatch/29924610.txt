 Novel scorpionate-type organocatalysts capable of effectively coupling carbon dioxide and epoxides under mild conditions to afford cyclic propylene carbonates were developed. On the basis of a combined experimental and computational study , a precise mechanistic proposal was developed and rational optimization strategies were identified. The epoxide ring-opening , which requires an iodide as a nucleophile , was enhanced by utilizing an immonium functionality that can form an ion pair with iodide , making the ring-opening process intramolecular. The CO
