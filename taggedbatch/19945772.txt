 Excessive cell death of enterocytes has been demonstrated to be partially associated with the intravenously-administrated lipid emulsions ( LEs) during parenteral nutrition ( PN) support. However , as a new generation of LE , the effect of fish oil-derived lipid emulsion ( FOLE) on the death of enterocytes remains elusive. Intestinal epithelial cells ( IEC-6 cell line) were treated with FOLE ( 0.25-1 %) for 24 h. Cell survival was measured by CCK-8 assay , and morphological changes were monitored by time-lapse live cell imaging. The expression of receptor-interacting protein 1/3 ( RIP1/3) and caspase 8 was assessed by westernblot , and the formation of necrosome ( characterized by the assembly of RIP1/3 complex along with the dissociation of caspase 8) was examined by immunoprecipitation. Additionally , the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS) was detected by using a ROS detection kit with an oxidation-sensitive probe ( DCFH-DA). FOLE dose-dependently induced non-apoptotic , but programmed necroctic cell death ( necroptosis) within 4-8 h after treatment. The assembly of RIP1/3 complex along with the dissociation of caspase 8 from RIP1 was observed in FOLE-treated cells. Moreover , FOLE-induced cell death was significantly alleviated by inhibiting RIP1 , and was further aggravated by inhibiting caspase 8. In addition , prior to cell death the accumulation of intracellular ROS was significantly increased in FOLE-treated cells ( increased by approximately 5-fold versus control , p < 0.001) , which could be attenuated by inhibiting RIP1 ( decreased by approximately 35 % versus FOLE , p < 0.05). FOLE induces RIP1-dependent and caspase 8-licensed necroptosis through overproduction of ROS in vitro. Our findings may provide novel insights into the clinical applications of FOLE during PN support.
