 Over the last several decades , novel populations of unconventional T cells have been identified; defined by an invariant ( or nearly invariant) T cell receptor ( TCR) with a fixed specificity to non-canonical antigens and major histocompatibility ( MHC) molecules , they form large , functionally monoclonal populations tasked with surveying for their specific antigens. With residence in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues coupled with their ability to rapidly produce a spectrum of cytokines and effector molecules , the unconventional T cells are poised as some of the first responders to infection/damage and are thought to provide critical coverage before more focused , conventional T cell responses are mobilized. However , new technologies for the measurement and characterization of TCR repertoires have identified an underappreciated amount of TCR diversity in the unconventional T cells. In many cases , the specificities of these diverse TCRs converge on the same or similar antigens as their invariant counterparts , while others have yet to be defined. Here , we will review the current knowledge of the TCR repertoires of unconventional T cells and discuss how repertoires might be used as a framework for their organization , and further our understanding of their role not only during an immune response , but also their contribution in maintaining homeostasis.
