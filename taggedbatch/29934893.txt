 Molecular docking is an in silico method widely applied in drug discovery programs to predict the binding mode of a given molecule interacting with a specific biological target. This computational technique is today emerging also in the field of predictive toxicology for regulatory purposes , being for instance successfully applied to develop classification models for the prediction of the endocrine disruptor potential of chemicals. Herein , we describe the protocol for adapting molecular docking to the purposes of predictive toxicology.
