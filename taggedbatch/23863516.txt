 Extragenital warts<disease> ( E-GWs) are common benign skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> caused by human papilloma virus. Surprisingly , there is no clear data about the impact of multiple E-GWs on quality of life in immune-competent adult patients in comparison to GWs , which have been frequently reported to exhibit a strong negative impact on life quality. This cross-sectional study investigated the impact of multiple E-GWs on quality of life in immune-competent adults as they are more commonly encountered in daily practice than their genital counterpart in the Egyptian population. Hundred patients with multiple E-GWs ( aged 18-67 years , 46 females , 54 males) and 100 patients with multiple GWs ( aged 18-55 years , 56 females , 44 males) were included. Cause for immune suppression in the patients was not known. A hard copy of the validated Arabic ( Egypt) version of Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI) questionnaire was used with permission. The DLQI total scores range was 5-14 with a mean of 11.2 ± 2.5 in GWs and 1-24 with a mean of 13.0 ± 5.8 in E-GWs , which are statistically significant ( E-GWs can have a very strong negative impact on patients ' daily life. We highly encourage all treating physicians to use the `` bio-psycho-social '' model when facing patients with E-GWs in an attempt to secure the best life quality for our patients.
