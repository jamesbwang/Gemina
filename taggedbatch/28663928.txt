 Recent advances in adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy ( AOSLO) have enabled visualization of cone inner segments through nonconfocal split-detection , in addition to rod and cone outer segments revealed by confocal reflectance. Here , we examined the interobserver reliability of cone density measurements in both AOSLO imaging modalities. Five normal subjects ( nine eyes) were imaged along the horizontal and vertical meridians using a custom AOSLO with confocal and nonconfocal split-detection modalities. The resulting images were montaged using a previously described semiautomatic algorithm. Regions of interest ( ROIs) were selected from the confocal montage at 190 μm , and from split-detection and confocal montages at 900 and 1800 μm from the fovea. Four observers ( three experts , one naïve) manually identified cone locations in each ROI , and these locations were used to calculate bound densities. Intraclass correlation coefficients and Dice 's coefficients were calculated to assess interobserver agreement. Interobserver agreement was high in cone-only images ( confocal 190 μm: 0.85; split-detection 900 μm: 0.91; split-detection 1800 μm: 0.89) , moderate in confocal images at 900 μm ( 0.68) , and poor in confocal images at 1800 μm ( 0.24). Excluding the naïve observer data substantially increased agreement within confocal images ( 190 μm: 0.99; 900 μm: 0.80; 1800 μm: 0.68). Interobserver measurements of cone density are more reliable in rod-free retinal images. Moreover , when using manual cell identification , it is essential that observers are trained , particularly for confocal AOSLO images. This study underscores the need for additional reliability studies in eyes containing pathology where identifying cones can be substantially more difficult.
