 To compare parent reported sleep behaviors of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD) and normal healthy controls and to examine the association of sleep disturbances with daytime behavioral difficulties in children with ASD. Sixty ASD children ( 85 % boys) ( Mean age = 6.1 y , SD = 2.4) were recruited from the Psychology unit of the Department of Pediatrics of a tertiary care hospital. An age and socio-economic status matched group of typically developing ( TD) children ( N = 60) were also recruited. The Children 's Sleep Habits Questionnaire ( CSHQ) was used to measure sleep problems. The Childhood Psychopathology Measurement Schedule was used to measure day time behavioral difficulties. Sleep problems were nearly two times more prevalent among children with ASD ( 88.3 %) as compared to the TD group ( 46.7 %) ( Ï‡ Children with ASD are at a high risk for sleep problems and this is associated with daytime behavior disturbances. Pediatricians should routinely screen ASD children for sleep problems and initiate timely and appropriate interventions.
