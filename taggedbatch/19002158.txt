 Injury to skeletal muscle affects millions of people worldwide. The underlying regenerative process however , is a very complex mechanism , time-wise highly coordinated , and subdivided in an initial inflammatory , a regenerative and a remodeling phase. Muscle regeneration can be impaired by several factors , among them diet-induced obesity ( DIO). In order to evaluate if obesity negatively affects healing processes after trauma , we utilized a blunt injury approach to damage the
