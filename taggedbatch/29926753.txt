 Objective The sedative dexmedetomidine plays a role in multi-organ protection by inhibiting toll-like receptor ( TLR) 4 expression in ischemia/reperfusion injury. The present study investigated whether the neuroprotective effects of dexmedetomidine could be blocked by the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide. Methods We established a cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model in neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats through bilateral carotid artery occlusion for 20 minutes followed by a 2-hour reperfusion. Rats were assigned to four groups: Sham operation , ischemia/reperfusion , ischemia/reperfusion preceded by dexmedetomidine treatment ( 10 µg/kg) , and ischemia/reperfusion preceded by dexmedetomidine ( 10 µg/kg) and lipopolysaccharide ( 500 µg/kg) treatments. Cerebral tissue injury was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining , and cerebral TLR4 expression was evaluated by real-time PCR and western blot. Results Pretreatment with dexmedetomidine reduced ischemia-induced morphological changes in the hippocampal CA3 region and downregulated TLR4 expression , but these neuroprotective effects were partially blocked by co-treatment with the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide. Conclusion Our results indicate that inhibition of cerebral TLR4 expression is related to the neuroprotective effects of dexmedetomidine in this neonatal rat cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model.
