 Coronary artery anomalies ( CAAs) include clinically and anatomically diverse types of congenital heart defects occurring in a complicated spectrum. The aim of the present study is to describe congenital anomalies of coronary arteries ( CAs) and their variations , and also identify the prevalence of these anomalies in our center. The study included a total of 6237 consecutive patients. Cine-angiographies and digital data of all patients undergoing coronary angiography ( CAG) were reviewed by at least 2 independent and experienced observers. The Basic Anatomic Classification method was used to classify patients with CAAs. Of a total of 6237 patients , 2,313 were females ( 37.1 %) and 3924 ( 62.9 %) were males. CAAs were detected in 247 out of 6237 patients ( 3.9 % , 95 % CI: 3.4-4.4). Of these patients , 48 ( 19.4 % , 95 % CI: 14.4-24.2) had absent left main coronary artery ( LMCA) , 21 ( 8.5 % , 95 % CI: 5-11.9) had anomalous origin from the appropriate sinus , 23 ( 9.3 % , 95 % CI: 5.7-12.9) had anomalous origin from structures other than appropriate sinus , 31 ( 12.6 % , 95 % CI: 8.5-16.6) had anomalous origin from the opposite sinus , 101 ( 40.9 % , 95 % CI: 34.8-46.9) had myocardial bridge , and 23 ( 9.3 % , 95 % CI: 5.7-12.9) had a coronary artery fistula<disease>. Our study results suggested that the total rate of coronary anomaly was found much higher than those reported in various invasive angiographic studies.
