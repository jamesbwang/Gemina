 Current wastewater treatment technologies do not remove many unregulated hydrophilic compounds , and there is growing interest that low levels of these compounds , referred to as emerging contaminants , may impact human health and the environment. A probabilistic-designed monitoring network was employed to infer the extent of Florida 's ambient freshwaters containing the wastewater ( Includes reuse water , septic systems leachate , and wastewater treatment effluent.) indicators sucralose , acetaminophen , carbamazepine , and primidone and those containing the widely used pesticide imidacloprid. Extent estimates with 95 % confidence bounds are provided for canals , rivers , streams , small and large lakes , and unconfined aquifers containing ultra-trace concentrations of these compounds as based on analyses of 2015 sample surveys utilizing 528 sites. Sucralose is estimated to occur in greater than 50 % of the canal , river , stream , and large lake resource extents. The pharmaceuticals acetaminophen , carbamazepine , and primidone are most prevalent in rivers , with approximately 30 % of river kilometers estimated to contain at least one of these compounds. Imidacloprid is estimated to occur in 50 % or greater of the canal and river resource extents , and it is the only compound found to exceed published toxicity or environmental effects standards. Geospatial analyses show sucralose detection frequencies within Florida 's drainage basins to be significantly related to the percentage of urban land use ( R
