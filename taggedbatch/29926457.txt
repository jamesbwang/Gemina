 Here we describe a facile strategy of general applicability for controlling the immobilization of individual nanomoieties on nanopatterned surfaces with single-molecule control. We combine the ability of DNA nanostructures as programmable platforms , with a one-step Focused Ion Beam nanopatterning , to demonstrate the controlled immobilization of DNA origami functionalized with individual quantum dots ( QDs) at predesigned positions on glass coverslips and silicon substrates. Remarkably , the platform developed is reusable after a simple cleaning process , and can be designed to display different geometrical arrangements.
