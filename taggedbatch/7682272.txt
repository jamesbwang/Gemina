 Venous ulcers<disease><symptom> are a common chronic problem in many countries especially in Northern Europe and USA. The overall prevalence of this condition is 1 % rising to 3 % in the over 65 years of age. Over the last 25 years , there have been many developments applicable to its diagnosis and treatment. These advances , notwithstanding healing response and recurrence , are variable , and the venous ulcer<disease><symptom> continues to be a clinical challenge. The pathogenesis of venous ulcers<disease><symptom> is unrelieved or ambulatory venous hypertension resulting mostly from deep venous thrombosis leading to venous incompetence , lipodermatosclerosis , leucocyte plugging of the capillaries , tissue hypoxia and microvascular dysfunction. It is not known what initiates venous ulcers<disease><symptom>. Triggers vary from trauma of the lower extremity to scratching to relieve itchy skin over the ankle region. Venous ulcers<disease><symptom> can be painful , and this condition presents an increasing burden of care. A systematic analysis of the role of technology used for diagnosis and management strongly supports the use of compression as a mainstay of standardised care. It further shows good evidence for the potential of some treatment procedures to accelerate healing. This article reviews the pathogenetic mechanisms , current diagnostic methods and standard care and its limitations.
