 Recent flow and mass cytometers generate datasets of dimensions 20 to 40 and a million single cells. From these , many tools facilitate the discovery of new cell populations associated with diseases or physiology. These new cell populations require the identification of new gating strategies , but gating strategies become exponentially more difficult to optimize when dimensionality increases. To facilitate this step , we developed Hypergate , an algorithm which given a cell population of interest identifies a gating strategy optimized for high yield and purity. Hypergate achieves higher yield and purity than human experts , Support Vector Machines and Random-Forests on public datasets. We use it to revisit some established gating strategies for the identification of innate lymphoid cells , which identifies concise and efficient strategies that allow gating these cells with fewer parameters but higher yield and purity than the current standards. For phenotypic description , Hypergate 's outputs are consistent with fields ' knowledge and sparser than those from a competing method. Hypergate is implemented in R and available on CRAN.
