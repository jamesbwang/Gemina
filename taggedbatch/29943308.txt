 In 2016 , the workflow for MRSA detection in nasal swabs was changed from a classic-manual workflow to an automated workflow using total lab automation ( TLA; BD Kiestra). This change entailed a reduction of the incubation time from 2 days to 20 h and reading of plates on weekdays and weekends instead of weekdays only. The workflow alteration did not include the introduction of 24/7. We wanted to follow up on the consequences for the times to report ( TTR). We compared the TTR of all nasal swabs , which were sent for MRSA detection from June until August in 2015 ( workflow-classic-manual) and in 2016 ( workflow-automated). We calculated median TTR and interquartile ranges for the three possible reporting outcomes ( negative , MRSA-known , MRSA-new) per day and workflow. A multivariable linear regression modeled the exposure variables workflow , day , and reporting outcome on TTR including interaction variables. The quantity and reasons for a TTR longer than 3 days were analyzed. During both 3-month periods , a total of 16,111 reports were issued ( 2015:7620; 2016:8491). The median TTR for negative reports was 48:28 ( hh: mm) in 2015 and 23:58 in 2016. In the linear regression , all exposure variables had a strong and highly significant ( p < 0.001) influence on the TTR. The number of reports with a TTR longer than 3 days shrank from 2418 ( 2015) to 60 ( 2016). The workflow alteration halved the median TTR for negative reports and the number of reports with a TTR longer than 3 days was reduced by 97.5 %.
