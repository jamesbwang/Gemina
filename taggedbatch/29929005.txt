 Current theories of pre-attentive deviant detection postulate that before the Superior Temporal Cortex ( STC) detects a change , the Inferior Frontal Cortex ( IFC) engages in stimulus analysis , which is particularly critical for ambiguous deviations ( e.g. , deviant preceded by a short train of standards). These theories rest on the assumption that IFC and STC are functionally connected , which has only been supported by correlational brain imaging studies. We examined this functional connectivity assumption by applying Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS) to disrupt IFC function , while measuring the later STC mismatch response with the event-related optical signal ( EROS). EROS can localize brain activity in both spatial and temporal dimensions via measurement of optical property changes associated with neuronal activity , and is inert to the electromagnetic interference produced by TMS. Specifically , the STC mismatch response at 120-180 ms elicited by a deviant preceded by a short standard train when IFC TMS was applied at 80 ms was compared with the STC mismatch responses in temporal control ( TMS with 200 ms delay) , spatial control ( sham TMS at vertex) , auditory control ( TMS pulse noise only) , and cognitive control ( deviant preceded by a long standard train) conditions. The STC mismatch response to deviants preceded by the short train was abolished by TMS of the IFC at 80 ms , while the STC responses remained intact in all other control conditions. These results confirm the involvement of the IFC in the STC mismatch response and support a functional connection between IFC and STC.
