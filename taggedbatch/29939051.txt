 Over the last 10 years , there has been a dramatic increase in published randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) of brief mindfulness training ( from single-session inductions to multisession interventions lasting up to 2 weeks) , with some preliminary indications that these training programs may improve mental health outcomes , such as negative affectivity. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate whether brief mindfulness training reliably reduces negative affectivity. PubMed , PsycINFO , and the Mindfulness Research Monthly Newsletter were systematically searched for brief mindfulness intervention RCTs assessing negative affectivity outcomes ( e.g. , depression<symptom> , rumination , anxiety<symptom> , stress). Sixty-five RCTs , including 5,489 participants predominantly without experience in meditation ( 64.64 % female , mean age = 24.62) , qualified for the meta-analytic review. The meta-analysis revealed a small but significant effect of brief mindfulness training on reducing negative affectivity compared to control programs ( g = .21 , p < .001). The overall effect size was significantly moderated by participant characteristics: community samples ( g = .41 , p < .001) produced larger training effects compared to student samples ( g = .14 , p = .001; Qbetween p = .03). No significant effect size differences were found between clinical and nonclinical samples. However , when accounting for publication bias , the overall effect size of brief mindfulness training programs on negative affectivity was significantly reduced ( g = .04). Brief mindfulness training programs are increasingly popular approaches for reducing negative affectivity. This meta-analysis indicates that brief mindfulness training modestly reduces negative affectivity. Quantitative analyses indicated the presence of publication bias ( i.e. , unpublished null effect studies) , highlighting the need to continue rigorous evaluation of brief mindfulness interventions.
