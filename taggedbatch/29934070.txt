 Norepinephrine is secreted under conditions of stress in humans. The ability of bacteria to sense mammalian hormone may have a role in propagation of infection. The present study investigated the effect of norepinephrine on in vitro growth of uropathogenic E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( UPEC) and the effect of silodosin on norepinephrine-induced changes. The spot urine samples were collected from 56 individuals ( 14 diabetic patients with UTI , 14 diabetic without UTI , 14 non-diabetic UTI and 14 healthy volunteer controls) for the measurement of urinary norepinephrine concentrations. The concentration of norepinephrine , as found in urine of human subjects , was reproduced in artificial urine medium to study the growth of UPEC. The norepinephrine concentration showing maximum growth response was selected to study the effect of silodosin on the growth inhibition of UPEC. Result showed significantly elevated urinary norepinephrine in diabetic patients with and without UTI and also in nondiabetic UTI groups. The norepinephrine concentration equivalent to that in diabetic UTI patients enhanced the growth of UPEC. Furthermore , silodosin ( 0.32 Î¼M) inhibited the growth of the UPEC.
