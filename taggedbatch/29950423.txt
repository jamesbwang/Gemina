 We have previously shown that HIV-1 infected children develop broader and more potent neutralizing antibody responses than adults. This study aimed to determine the antibody specificities in 16 HIV-1 subtype C infected children who displayed exceptional neutralization breadth on a 22 multi-subtype virus panel. All children were ART-naive with normal CD4 counts despite being infected for a median of 10.1 years with high viral loads. The specificity of bNAbs was determined using epitope-ablating mutants , chimeric constructs and depletion or inhibition of activity with peptides and glycoproteins. We found that bNAbs in children largely targeted previously defined epitopes , including the V2-glycan , V3-glycan , CD4bs and gp120-gp41 interface. Remarkably , 63 % of children had antibodies targeting 2 or 3 and in one case 4 of these bNAb epitopes. Longitudinal analysis of plasma from a mother-child pair over 9 years showed that while they both had similar neutralization profiles , the antibody specificities differed. The mother developed antibodies targeting the V2-glycan and CD4bs whereas bNAb specificities in the child could not be mapped until 6 years when a minor V2-glycan response appeared. The child also developed high titre MPER binding antibodies , not seen in the mother , although these were not a major bNAb specificity. Overall , exceptional neutralization breadth in this group of children may be the result of extended exposure to high antigenic load in the context of an intact immune system , which allowed for the activation of multiple B cell lineages and the generation of polyclonal responses targeting several bNAb epitopes.
