 Lunar basalt 15016 ( ~ 3.3 Ga) is among the most vesicular ( 50 % by volume) basalts recovered by the Apollo missions. We investigated the possible occurrence of indigenous lunar nitrogen and noble gases trapped in vesicles within basalt 15016 , by crushing several cm-sized chips. Matrix/mineral gases were also extracted from crush residues by fusion with a CO
