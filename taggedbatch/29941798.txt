 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) are common organic contaminants found in anoxic environments. The capacity for PAH biodegradation in unimpacted environments , however , has been understudied. Here we investigate the enrichment , selection , and sustainability of a microbial community from a pristine environment on naphthalene as the only amended carbon source. Pristine coastal sediments were obtained from the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve in Tuckerton , New Jersey , an ecological reserve which has no direct input or source of hydrocarbons. After an initial exposure to naphthalene , primary anaerobic transfer cultures completely degraded 500 & micro; M naphthalene within 139 days. Subsequent transfer cultures mineralized naphthalene within 21 days with stoichiometric sulfate loss. Enriched cultures efficiently utilized only naphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene from the hydrocarbon mixtures in crude oil. To determine the microorganisms responsible for naphthalene degradation , stable isotope probing was utilized on cultures amended with fully labeled
