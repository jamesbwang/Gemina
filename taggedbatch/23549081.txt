 Neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs) are web-like DNA decorated with antimicrobial proteins , such as myeloperoxidase ( MPO) , which are extruded from activated neutrophils. Although NETs are essential in innate immunity , an excessive formation of NETs has adverse effects , e.g. , induction of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( ANCA) , to the hosts. Since ANCA can induce NET formation in the primed neutrophils , a positive feedback loop can be formed between NETs and ANCA , which is called `` ANCA-NETs vicious cycle. '' A 79-year-old Japanese woman developed hydralazine-induced pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis<disease> with MPO-ANCA. Although the illness improved after cessation of hydralazine , MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis relapsed 16 months later. Remission was achieved 5 months after beginning of administration of prednisone. In order to determine the involvement of ANCA-NETs vicious cycle in this patient , we examined NET degradation and induction activities in sera obtained at the disease onset ( Serum A; MPO-ANCA , 107 IU/ml) , at relapse ( Serum B; MPO-ANCA , 195 IU/ml) , at 3 months after treatment ( Serum C; MPO-ANCA , 4.5 IU/ml) , and at remission ( Serum D; MPO-ANCA , 2.4 IU/ml). NET degradation activity was low in the all sera. NET induction activity was high in Sera A , B , and C but not in D. Additionally , we demonstrated the presence of anti-NET antibody ( ANETA) in Sera B and C but not in A or D. The collective findings suggest NET induction potential of ANETA in the present patient and that the ANETA could contribute to the enhancement of NETs resulting in amplification of the ANCA-NETs vicious cycle.
