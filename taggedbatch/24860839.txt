 Suspended aqueous aerosol droplets ( < 50 µm) are microreactors for many important atmospheric reactions. In droplets and other aquatic environments , pH is arguably the key parameter dictating chemical and biological processes. The nature of the droplet air/water interface has the potential to significantly alter droplet pH relative to bulk water. Historically , it has been challenging to measure the pH of individual droplets because of their inaccessibility to conventional pH probes. In this study , we scanned droplets containing 4-mercaptobenzoic acid-functionalized gold nanoparticle pH nanoprobes by 2D and 3D laser confocal Raman microscopy. Using surface-enhanced Raman scattering , we acquired the pH distribution inside approximately 20-µm-diameter phosphate-buffered aerosol droplets and found that the pH in the core of a droplet is higher than that of bulk solution by up to 3.6 pH units. This finding suggests the accumulation of protons at the air/water interface and is consistent with recent thermodynamic model results. The existence of this pH shift was corroborated by the observation that a catalytic reaction that occurs only under basic conditions ( i.e. , dimerization of 4-aminothiophenol to produce dimercaptoazobenzene) occurs within the high pH core of a droplet , but not in bulk solution. Our nanoparticle probe enables pH quantification through the cross-section of an aerosol droplet , revealing a spatial gradient that has implications for acid-base-catalyzed atmospheric chemistry.
