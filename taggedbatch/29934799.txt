 To investigate whether patients ' skin<symptom> color could exert an influence on the dentist 's decision-making for treatment , in four different cities in Brazil. Lists of dentists were obtained and the sample selection was performed systematically. Two questionnaires were produced for the same clinical case , but the images were digitally manipulated to obtain a patient with a black and a white skin<symptom> color. Dentists were free to choose treatment without any restrictions , including the financial aspects. A random sequence ( white or black) was generated which was placed at random in sealed , opaque envelopes. Dentists were questioned about the decision on the treatment of a severely decayed tooth and an ill-adapted amalgam restoration. A total of 636 dentists agreed to participate in the study. After adjustments ( multinomial logistic regression) , it was observed that the black patient with a decayed tooth had a 50 % lower risk of being referred for prosthetic treatment ( p = 0.023) and a 99 % higher risk of receiving a composite resin restoration , compared to the white patient ( p = 0.027). No differences were observed regarding recommendation for tooth extraction ( p = 0.657). In relation to an ill-adapted amalgam , the black patient had less risk of receiving a referral replacement with composite resin ( 0.09 95 % CI ( 0.01-0.82)) and finishing and polishing ( 0.11 5 % CI ( 0.01-0.99)) compared with the white patient. Patient skin<symptom> color influenced the dentist 's choice of treatment. In general , black patients receive referrals for cheaper , simpler procedures. Skin<symptom> color played an important role in dentists ' treatment decisions. Professionals may contribute unconsciously to the propagation and replication of racial discrimination.
