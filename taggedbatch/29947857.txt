 A submucous cleft palate and a congenitally short velum are diagnosed rather late , because symptoms are often mild. The pre- and postoperative clinical symptoms for both conditions are presented. The data of 180 patients with a submucous cleft palate ( 161) or congenitally short velum ( 19) were retrospective analyzed. In 23.3 % , a syndromic association was found. Clinical findings for both conditions included middle ear problems , hypernasal speech , nasal penetration , the absence of the posterior nasal spine of the hard palate and/or a bifid uvula with a zona pellucida. The average age at diagnosis was 4.2 years in submucous clefts and 5.7 years in children with a congenitally short velum. Surgical palatoplasty with fusion of soft palate muscles and/or elongation of the soft palate was performed in 83.9 % of the children , aiming to achieve sufficient velopharyngeal closure ( VPC) with a significant decrease of symptoms and , hence , better conditions for speech therapy interventions. The overall success rate of the VPC was 63.7 % with improvement in up to 2 of the 3 clinical symptoms ( hypernasal speech , nasal penetration , middle ear problems). Hypernasal speech was more common ( in 89.5 %) in children with a congenitally short velum before surgery and in 81.3 % 8 weeks after surgery; however , prior to surgery they had a short soft palate. Surgical intervention was particularly effective in children younger than 5 years. Syndromic diseases are disproportionately associated with soft palate defects.
