 We report the first example of synthesis of mono-N , O-B-chelated dipyrromethenes ( BODIPY) derivatives through an unexpected intramolecular nucleophilic displacement of the fluorine by alkenols in the presence of boron trifluoride as Lewis acid. The chlorine in the indacene core allowed the further structural modification through nucleophilic substitutions or palladium catalyzed coupling reactions to afford new fluorophores with tunable photophysical properties. Their expanded conjugation structure resulted in the distinct red-shifted absorption and emission spectra in organic solutions. Furthermore , the twisted steric hindrance of benzene substitutions suppressed aggregation induced quenching , leading to the enhanced NIR emission in aggregate/solid state , which was rarely observed for BODIPY dyes. The nanoparticles of the fluorophores formed by the assembly with polymeric surfactant F127 were successfully used for bioimaging of living cells and the tumor-targeted imaging in tumor-bearing mouse model.
