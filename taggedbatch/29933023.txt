 The magnetic targeting ( MT) technique improves delivery of mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs) to target sites. However , the moderate-intensity static magnetic fields ( SMF) used for MT may exert adverse effects on MSCs. Thus , we aimed to evaluate the effects of SMF on MSCs in vitro. Cells were initially magnetized using citrate-coated magnetite nanoparticles. Then , control and magnetized MSCs were transferred to an in vitro MT system and exposed to 0.3-0.45 Tesla SMFs. MSC viability , morphology , ultrastructure , proliferation rates , differentiation , and immunomodulation were evaluated after 24 and 48 hours of exposure. MSCs temporarily lost viability and exhibited ultrastructural changes after exposure to SMFs , regardless of magnetization. Moreover , exposure to SMF reduced magnetized MSC proliferation rates. Nevertheless , MSCs remained functional ( i.e. , capable of differentiating , secreting repair mediators , and modulating alveolar macrophage phenotype). Thus , the experimental protocol tested in this experiment can be applied in future in vivo MT studies.
