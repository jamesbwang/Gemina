 To compare the accuracy of the anterior corneal simulated keratometry ( SimK) and the Holladay equivalent keratometry reading ( EKR) provided by a Scheimpflug camera ( Pentacam HR) with the keratometry ( K) provided by a Placido system ( T-Cone topography) in keratoconus and control eyes. This prospective study included 40 consecutive patients with keratoconus and 40 voluntary participants with no ocular complaints. Any patients with corneal scar , corneal trauma , history of corneal surgery or contact lens usage were excluded from the study. Mean SimK and Holladay EKR measurements were taken with Pentacam HR in the 2 , 3 , and 4.5 mm corneal zones , and these values were compared with the T-Cone mean K value with the Placido topography system attachment on the Lenstar LS 900. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired Student 's t test and the Bland-Altman analysis. A statistically significant difference was determined between the Placido K and the Scheimpflug EKR 2 , 3 , 4.5 mm and SimK values in the keratoconus group ( p < 0.05). In the analyses which showed a difference between the SimK and Holladay EKR , it was observed that as the diameter of the corneal zone increased , the 95 % LoA values were extended. No statistically significant difference was determined between the SimK and EKR 2 mm values ( p > 0.05). In the control group , there was no statistically significant difference between any of the keratometric values. In diseases which affect the posterior corneal surface , such as keratoconus , it is thought that because of the asymmetrical peripheral placement of the corneal apex , as the corneal diameter increases there could be an error increase of 1-3 mm in keratometric systems evaluating the anterior surface.
