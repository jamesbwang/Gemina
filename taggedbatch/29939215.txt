 Advances in RNA sequencing technologies and computational methodologies have provided a huge impetus to noncoding RNA ( ncRNA) study. Once regarded as inconsequential results of transcriptional promiscuity , ncRNAs were later found to exert great roles in various aspects of biological functions. They are emerging as key players in gene regulatory networks by interacting with other biomolecules ( DNA , RNA or protein). Here , we provide an overview of ncRNA repertoire and highlight recent discoveries of their versatile interactions. To better investigate the ncRNA-mediated regulation , it is necessary to make full use of innovative sequencing techniques and computational tools. We further describe a comprehensive workflow for in silico ncRNA analysis , providing up-to-date platforms , databases and tools dedicated to ncRNA identification and functional annotation.
