 The G protein-coupled receptors 3 , 6 , and 12 ( GPR3 , GPR6 , and GPR12) comprise a family of closely related orphan receptors with no confirmed endogenous ligands. These receptors are constitutively active and capable of signaling through G protein-mediated and non-G protein-mediated mechanisms. These orphan receptors have previously been reported to play important roles in many normal physiological functions and to be involved in a variety of pathological conditions. Although they are orphans , GPR3 , GPR6 , and GPR12 are phylogenetically most closely related to the cannabinoid receptors. Using Î²-arrestin2 recruitment and cAMP accumulation assays , we recently found that the nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid cannabidiol ( CBD) is an inverse agonist for GPR3 , GPR6 , and GPR12. This discovery highlights these orphan receptors as potential new molecular targets for CBD , provides novel mechanisms of action , and suggests new therapeutic uses of CBD for illnesses such as Alzheimer 's disease , Parkinson 's disease , cancer , and infertility<symptom>. Furthermore , identification of CBD as a new inverse agonist for GPR3 , GPR6 , and GPR12 provides the initial chemical scaffolds upon which potent and efficacious agents acting on these receptors can be developed , with the goal of developing chemical tools for studying these orphan receptors and ultimately new therapeutic agents.
