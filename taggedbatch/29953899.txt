 High-throughput screens in cancer cell lines ( CCLs) have been used for decades to help researchers identify compounds with the potential to improve the treatment of cancer and , more recently , to identify genomic susceptibilities in cancer via genome-wide shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 screens. Additionally , rich genomic and transcriptomic data of these CCLs has allowed researchers to pair this screening data with biological features , enabling efforts to identify biomarkers of treatment response and gene dependencies. In this paper , we review the major CCL screening efforts and the large datasets these screens have made available. We also assess the CCL screens collectively and include a resource with harmonized CCL and compound identifiers to facilitate comparisons across screens. The CCLs in these screens were found to represent a wide range of cancer types , with a strong correlation between the representation of a cancer type and its associated mortality. Patient ages and gender distributions of CCLs were generally as expected , with some notable exceptions of female underrepresentation in certain disease types. Also , ethnicity information , while largely incomplete , suggests that African American and Hispanic patients may be severely underrepresented in these screens. Nearly all genes were targeted in the genetic perturbations screens , but the compounds used for the drug screens target less than half of known cancer drivers , likely reflecting known limitations in our drug design capabilities. Finally , we discuss recent developments in the field and the promise they hold for enabling future screens to overcome previous limitations and lead to new breakthroughs in cancer treatment.
