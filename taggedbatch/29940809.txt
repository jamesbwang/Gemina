 Stimuli-responsive hydrogels have been widely researched as carrier systems , due to their excellent biocompatibility and responsiveness to external physiologic environment factors. In this study , dextran-based nanogel with covalently conjugated doxorubicin ( DOX) was developed via Schiff base formation using the inverse microemulsion technique. Since the Schiff base linkages are acid-sensitive , drug release profile of the DOX-loaded nanogel would be pH-dependent. In vitro drug release studies confirmed that DOX was released much faster under acidic condition ( pH 2.0 , 5.0) than that at pH 7.4. Approximately 66 , 28 , and 9 % of drug was released in 72 h at pH 2.0 , 5.0 , and 7.4 , respectively. Cell uptake by the human breast cancer cell ( MCF-7) demonstrated that the DOX-loaded dextran nanogel could be internalized through endocytosis and distributed in endocytic compartments inside tumor cells. These results indicated that the Schiff base-containing nanogel can serve as a pH-sensitive drug delivery system. And the presence of multiple aldehyde groups on the nanogel are available for further conjugations of targeting ligands or imaging probes.
