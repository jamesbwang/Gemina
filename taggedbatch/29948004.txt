 To assess the feasibility and outcome of microwave ablation ( MWA) of hepatic tumors in anatomically challenging locations. A total of 94 patients with 174 hepatic tumors referred for CT-guided MWA were included in this retrospective institutional review board-approved study. One hundred and twenty-five tumors ( median size 17 mm , range 12-24 mm) with subcapsular location ( n = 91) and/or in which a transpleural approach was applied ( n = 53) were identified ( group 1) and compared to tumors with a central intrahepatic location ( group 2; n = 49 , median size 19 mm , range 12-23 mm). Technical success , complications and local tumor progression ( LTP) were evaluated. Risk factors were analyzed using univariate analysis , logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier curves ( p < 0.05 deemed significant). Technical success was 100 % in both groups. In group 1 , complications occurred in n = 31 tumors ( 24.8 %; pneumothorax n = 20; hematoma n = 11). Complications occurred significantly less often in group 2 ( 8.2 %; n = 4 ( hematoma); p = 0.011). There were no major complications. Transpleural approach and number of capsule punctures were identified as risk factors for complications ( all p < 0.05). Median follow-up was 265 days. LTP was comparable between both groups ( 13.6 vs. 10.2 %; p = 0.41). Use of hydrodissection was the only independent factor associated with LTP ( p = 0.03 , HR 3.29). CT-guided hepatic MWA of subcapsular tumors and subdiaphragmatic tumors requiring a direct or transpleural approach is feasible with increased minor but not major complications. LTP did not differ significantly between both groups.
