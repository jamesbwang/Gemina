 This study explored D-ribose pharmacokinetics after intravenous ( IV) and oral administration to healthy rabbits. D-ribose was administered once as 420 mg/kg ( N = 4) or 840 mg/kg ( N = 6) dose intravenously , or as an oral dose of 420 mg/kg ( N = 3) or 840 mg/kg ( N = 3). Serum was obtained at various time points , up to 210 minutes after administration. Urine was also collected after IV administration. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from drug concentration-time data using Kinetica software. The findings showed that D-ribose follows a dose-dependent kinetic profile. With doubling the IV dose , AUC Collectively , D-ribose showed a dose-dependent kinetic profile , where parameters change according to dosing levels. D-ribose clearance seems to follow first-order kinetics at low dose. Thereafter , elimination systems are saturated , and elimination continues in a fast manner. Urine recovery was partial , which could be attributed to the several metabolic pathways that pentose can undergo.
