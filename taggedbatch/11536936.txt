 We introduce a Bayesian method for guiding future directions for detection of life on exoplanets. We describe empirical and theoretical work necessary to place constraints on the relevant likelihoods , including those emerging from better understanding stellar environment , planetary climate and geophysics , geochemical cycling , the universalities of physics and chemistry , the contingencies of evolutionary history , the properties of life as an emergent complex system , and the mechanisms driving the emergence of life. We provide examples for how the Bayesian formalism could guide future search strategies , including determining observations to prioritize or deciding between targeted searches or larger lower resolution surveys to generate ensemble statistics and address how a Bayesian methodology could constrain the prior probability of life with or without a positive detection.
