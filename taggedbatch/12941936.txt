 None Here , we investigated toxin domain functions that regulate the proinflammatory activity of Blocking autoprocessing of TcdB by mutagenesis or chemical inhibition , while reducing cytotoxicity of the toxin , significantly enhanced its proinflammatory activities in the animal model. Furthermore , a noncleavable mutant TcdB was significantly more potent than the wild-type toxin in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines in human colonic tissues and immune cells. In this study , we identified a novel mechanism of regulating the biological activities of
