 Neurodegeneration can result in memory<symptom> loss<symptom> in the central nervous system ( CNS) and impairment of taste and smell in the peripheral nervous system ( PNS). The neurodegeneration seen in Parkinson 's disease ( PD) is characterized by functional loss of dopaminergic neurons. Recent studies have also found a role for dopaminergic neurons in regulating taste memory rewards in insects. To investigate how taste memories and sugar sensitivity can be affected in PD , we utilized the DJ-1β mutant fruit fly , DJ-1βex54 , as a PD model. We performed binary choice feeding assays , electrophysiology and taste-mediated memory tests to explore the function of the DJ-1β gene in terms of sugar sensitivity as well as associative taste memory. We found that PD flies exhibited an impaired ability to discriminate sucrose across a range of sugar concentrations , with normal responses at only very high concentrations of sugar. They also showed an impairment in associative taste memory. We highlight that the taste impairment and memory defect in DJ-1βex54 can be recovered by the expression of wild-type DJ-1β gene in the dopaminergic neurons. We also emphasized the role of dopaminergic neurons in restoring taste memory function. This impaired memory property of DJ-1βex54 flies also allows them to be used as a model system for finding supplementary dietary foods that can improve memory function. Here we provide evidence that the associative taste memory of both control and DJ-1βex54 flies can be enhanced with dietary supplementation of the medicinal plant , omija.
