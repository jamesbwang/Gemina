 Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) infection usually presents as a mild and self-limited illness , but it may be associated with severe outcomes. We describe a case of a 30-year-old man with systemic erythematous lupus and common variable immunodeficiency who became infected with both Zika ( ZIKV) and Chikungunya ( CHIKV) virus<pathogen> during the 2016 outbreak in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil. The patient presented with intense wrist and right ankle arthritis<disease><symptom> , and ZIKV<pathogen> RNA and virus particles were detected in synovial tissue , blood and urine , and CHIKV RNA in serum sample , at the time of the diagnosis. During the follow up , ZIKV<pathogen> RNA persisted for 275 days post symptoms onset. The patient evolved with severe arthralgia/arthritis and progressive deterioration of renal function. Fatal outcome occurred after 310 days post ZIKV<pathogen> and CHIKV co-infection onset. The results show the development of severe disease and fatal outcome of ZIKV<pathogen> infection in an immunosuppressed adult<disease>. The data suggests a correlation between immunodeficiency and prolonged ZIKV<pathogen> RNA shedding in both blood and urine with progressive disease. The results also indicate a possible role for arbovirus co-infections as risk factors for severe and fatal outcomes from ZIKV infection.
