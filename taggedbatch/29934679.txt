 Although breast milk is the best diet in the first few months of life , risks can arise for the breast-fed infant. The article gives a comprehensive overview of possible risks regarding xenobiotics and pathogens in mother 's milk , including medications , smoking , alcohol consumption , coffee consumption , persistent environmental contaminants and residues as well as infections.Where drug therapy is indicated , suitable medications are available for most conditions nowadays , so that prolonged nursing breaks or even weaning is not required. Long-term treatment , especially under combination therapy , needs to be examined on a case-by-case basis , however. Smoking and alcohol consumption should be avoided during the breastfeeding period , while moderate coffee consumption ( up to 2 cups daily) is not of concern. The current levels of environmental contaminants and residues in breast milk are considered to be harmless to health; indeed , the body burden of dioxins considered to be critically high more than 20 years ago has been reduced by a factor of 10 to date. Among maternal infections , an human deficiency virus ( HIV<pathogen>) infection is one of the few medical indications for weaning in countries with adequate hygiene standards.All in all , the risks of xenobiotics and pathogens in mother 's milk are generally low in exclusively breastfed infants , so that there is usually no need for prolonged nursing breaks or even weaning. In only a small number of maternal conditions ( certain medications , HIV<pathogen> infection) , the infant should not be breastfed.
