 The prevalence of papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC) is rising rapidly. However , there are no reliable serum biomarkers for PTC. This study aimed to investigate the validity of preoperative serum matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2) as a biomarker for predicting prognosis of PTC after total or partial thyroidectomy. Male patients with PTC or a benign thyroid nodule<disease> ( BTN) and healthy controls ( HCs) were retrospectively included. Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the performance of preoperative serum MMP-2 in diagnosing PTC , predicting lymph node metastasis ( LNM) , and predicting structurally persistent/recurrent disease ( SPRD). Multivariate logistic regression and Cox regression were applied to identify independent risk factors for SPRD. The preoperative serum MMP-2 concentration in the PTC group was higher than those in BTN and HC groups. The concentration of postoperative serum MMP-2 decreased in comparison with pre-operation. ROC curves showed that serum MMP-2 could differentially diagnose PTC from BTN at the cutoff value of 86.30 ng/ml with an area under the curve ( AUC) of 0.905 and could predict central LNM ( CLNM) at the cutoff value of 101.55 ng/ml with an AUC of 0.711. Serum MMP-2 ≥ 101.55 ng/ml , age ≥ 45 years , and advanced TNM stage were independent risk factors for CLNM. Patients with SPRD had a higher median MMP-2 level ( 149.22 ng/ml) than patients without SPRD ( 104.55 ng/ml). Serum MMP-2 at the cutoff value of 144.04 ng/ml could predict SPRD in PTC patients with an AUC of 0.803. Advanced TNM stage and serum MMP-2 ≥ 144.04 ng/ml were independent risk factors for SPRD. Patients with serum MMP-2 ≥ 144.04 ng/ml had a worse clinical outcome than those with MMP-2 < 144.04 ng/ml. Preoperative serum MMP-2 may serve as a biomarker for diagnosing PTC and a predictive indicator for LNM and SPRD in male patients with PTC.
