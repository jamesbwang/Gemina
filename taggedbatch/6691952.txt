 To compare the photorefraction system ( Welch Allyn Spot ™) performance with subjective refraction in school sight program in one Odisha ( India) tribal district. In a cross-sectional study school students , aged 5-15 years , referred after the preliminary screening by trained school teachers received photoscreening and subjective correction. The photoscreener was compared to subjective refraction in the range of +2 D to -7.5 D. Statistical analysis included Friedman nonparametric test , Wilcoxon signed-rank test , linear regression , and Bland-Altman plotting. The photoscreener was used in 5990 children. This analysis included 443 children ( 187 males , 256 females , and the mean age was 12.43 ± 2.5 years) who received both photorefraction and subjective correction , and vision improved to 6/6 in either eye. The median spherical equivalent ( SE) with spot photorefraction was 0.00 D ( minimum -5.0 D; maximum +1.6 D) , and with subjective correction was 0.00 D ( minimum -6.00 D; maximum +1.5 D). The difference in the SE between the two methods was statistically significant ( P < 0.001) using Friedman nonparametric test; it was not significant for J 45 and J 180 ( P = 0.39 and P = 0.17 , respectively). There was a good correlation in linear regression analysis ( R Photorefraction may be recommended for autorefraction in school screening with reasonable accuracy if verified with a satisfactory subjective correction. The added advantages include its speed , need of less expensive eye care personnel , ability to refract both eyes together , and examination possibility in the native surrounding.
