 Arterial stiffness is an emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease and dietary anthocyanins may be important in mediating vascular tone. The present study investigated the effect of consumption of an anthocyanin-rich potato , Purple Majesty on arterial stiffness measured as pulse wave velocity in 14 healthy male and female adults. Participants consumed 200 g/day of cooked purple potato containing 288 mg anthocyanins , or a white potato containing negligible anthocyanins for 14 days , separated by a 7-day washout period. Non-invasive assessment of vascular tone by pulse wave velocity was determined in addition to systolic and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , high-density lipoproteins , low-density lipoproteins , triglycerides , glucose , insulin and C-reactive protein. Pulse wave velocity was significantly reduced ( p = 0.001) following Purple Majesty consumption for 14-days. There were no significant changes with any other clinical parameter measured , and no changes following white potato consumption. The findings from this short-term study indicate a potential effect of Purple Majesty consumption on arterial stiffness.
