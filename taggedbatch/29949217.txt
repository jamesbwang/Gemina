 Optical properties of ( Re ( CO) 3 ( dppz) ( py)) + ( dppz = dipyrido ( 3,2-a: 2 ' ,3 '- c) phenazine; py = pyridine) in acetonitrile , water and DNA have been investigated based on DFT , time-dependent-DFT ( TD-DFT)/ conductor-like screening model , with and without explicit solvent molecules , and molecular dynamics. Whereas implicit solvent model is not appropriate to model optical properties of dppz-substituted metal complexes , adding explicit solvent molecules in interaction with dppz stabilizes the metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer ( MLCT) transitions. Classical molecular dynamics simulations point to an important conformational flexibility , as evidenced by the coexistence of two conformers A and B. When considering the conformational sampling , the lowest band of the absorption spectrum is red-shifted and broadened up to 500 nm in agreement with the experimental spectra supporting important dynamical effects. The absorption spectra of ( Re ( CO) 3 ( dppz) ( py-R)) +/ GC-DNA and ( Re ( CO) 3 ( dppz) ( py-R)) +/ AT-DNA ( R = CH2-CH2-COO-) intercalated in both major or minor grooves exhibit a lowest energy charge separated ( CS) band at about 600 nm and 500 nm , respectively , corresponding mainly to excitations from guanine and adenine to dppz. These states may play a central role into DNA-mediated charge transport processes. The over stabilization of the lowest 3ILdppz state of ( Re ( CO) 3 ( dppz) ( py)) + in water as compared to acetonitrile could be responsible for the quenching of emission in water.
