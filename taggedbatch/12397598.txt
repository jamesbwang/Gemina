 Neuroinflammation accompanies neural trauma and most neurological diseases. Axotomy in the peripheral nervous system ( PNS) leads to dramatic changes in the injured neuron: the cell body expresses a distinct set of genes known as regeneration-associated genes , the distal axonal segment degenerates and its debris is cleared , and the axons in the proximal segment form growth cones and extend neurites. These processes are orchestrated in part by immune and other non-neuronal cells. Macrophages in ganglia play an integral role in supporting regeneration. Here , we explore further the molecular and cellular components of the injury-induced immune response within peripheral ganglia. Adult male wild-type ( WT) and Ccr2 Chemokine expression in the ganglia differed 48 h after nerve injury with a large increase in macrophage inflammatory protein-1Î³ in the SCG but not in the DRG , while C-C class chemokine ligand 2 was highly expressed in both ganglia. Differences between WT and Ccr2 This study demonstrates both molecular and cellular differences in the nerve injury-induced immune response between DRG and SCG and between WT and Ccr2
