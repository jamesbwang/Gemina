 Aim of the study was to evaluate the possible relationship between Temperament traits and executive dysfunction in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD). Patients affected by PD diagnosed according to the UK Parkinson 's disease Society Brain Bank criteria were enrolled in the study. Patients with a Mini<pathogen> Mental<symptom> State Examination < 24 were excluded from the study. The Temperament and Character Inventory ( TCI) , a self-report questionnaire assessing the Harm Avoidance ( HA) , Novelty Seeking ( NS) and Reward Dependence ( RD) temperamental traits , has been performed. The executive functions were assessed with the Frontal Assessment Battery ( FAB). Fifty PD patients ( 28 men and 22 women; mean age 59.1 ± 10.1 years) were enrolled. High HA ( mean score 73.3 ± 24.7) and a low NS score ( 24.2 ± 18.7) were recorded. Fifteen ( 30 %) patients presented a pathological FAB score ( ≤ 13.5). Patients with a pathological FAB score presented an HA score significantly higher than patients with normal FAB score ( respectively 84.9 ± 13.7 versus 69.8 ± 26.9; p = 0.045). At the univariate analysis an association between high HA score and pathological FAB score was found ( OR 3.85 , 95 % CI 1.06-13.9; p-value 0.040). Our study confirmed an association between executive disturbances and HA in PD patients , possibly related to a common impairment of the frontostriatal circuits.
