 Multiphoton intravital calcium imaging is a powerful technique that enables high-resolution longitudinal monitoring of cellular and subcellular activity hundreds of microns deep in the living organism. This unit addresses the application of 2-photon microscopy to imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators ( GECIs) in the mouse brain. The protocols in this unit enable real-time intravital imaging of intracellular calcium concentration simultaneously in hundreds of neurons , or at the resolution of single synapses , as mice respond to sensory stimuli or perform behavioral tasks. Protocols are presented for implantation of a cranial imaging window to provide optical access to the brain and for 2-photon image acquisition. Protocols for implantation of both open skull and thinned skull windows for single or multi-session imaging are described. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
