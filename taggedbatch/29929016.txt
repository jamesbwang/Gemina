 Postoperative complications after transverse vaginal septum excision include stricture formation. The purpose of this report is to describe use of intralesional corticosteroid injections for vaginal strictures. A 32-year-old gravida 0 with history of transverse vaginal septum and recurrent strictures presented for follow-up of chronic<disease> pelvic pain. After her fourth septum revision , the patient underwent a total of 7 triamcinolone injections at the septum tissue. The course of triamcinolone injections improved the stricture and patient 's pain. Steroid injection into the vaginal septum tissue can be a safe and effective adjuvant therapy after septum resection. Although it is an established adjuvant therapy in other specialties , further studies are warranted to show a decrease in the recurrence rate of vaginal strictures.
