 Infectious endocarditis<disease> ( IE) clinically manifests as either subacute bacterial endocarditis<disease> ( SBE) or acute bacterial endocarditis<disease> ( ABE). Neurologic manifestations are markedly different for these two entities. ABE is caused by invasive , highly virulent pathogens ( e.g. , Here , we reviewed the clinical and radiographic presentations of a patient with cranial complications attributed to ABE. Such patients typically develop central nervous system ( CNS) septic emboli resulting in stroke ( with/without intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH)) and/or mycotic aneurysms<disease> resulting in ICH bleeds. With ABE , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) seeding may result in acute bacterial meningitis<disease><symptom> ( ABM) , documented by positive Gram stain and/or culture for Here , we reviewed the literature for intracranial pathology accompanying ABE versus SBE. ABE typically results in acute ischemia , septic emboli , stroke/hemorrhagic infarcts , or ICH. SBE more classically produces septic microemboli and mycotic aneurysms<disease> that may leak , but rarely producing ICH. We also presented a patient with ABE attributed to
