 Introduction The prevalence of pediatric obesity is an issue in the United States , in which approximately one-third of children and adolescents are overweight or obese. Youth living in low socioeconomic ( SES) households are at an increased risk for developing obesity; yet , research is needed to understand the mechanisms that might better explain the relationship between SES and obesity risk. Maternal depression<symptom> presents a potential mechanism by which SES might predict a later risk for obesity in pediatric populations. Methods The present study used a national dataset from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development ( NICHD-SECCYD) to examine whether maternal depressive symptoms ( at an age of 9 years) mediated the association between early SES ( the income-to-needs ratio measured at an age of 1 month) and adolescent weight outcomes ( Body Mass Index z-scores ( zBMI) for age and sex , at an age of 15 years). Results The results suggested that greater maternal depressive symptoms helped to explain a significant amount of the variance of lower SES predicting poorer weight outcomes in adolescents. Discussion These findings illustrate the role of maternal depressive symptoms in explaining how SES predicts adolescent weight outcomes. Implications are discussed , and future research is needed to identify women from lower SES households who are experiencing depressive symptoms to provide support and initiate points of early intervention to address relevant health outcomes in youths.
