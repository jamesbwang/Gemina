 Robust evidence is lacking regarding the clinical efficacy , safety and cardiopulmonary performance of perventricular closure. This study investigated the perioperative efficacy , safety and cardiorespiratory performance of perventricular closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defects ( pmVSDs). Operation-na√Øve infants and young children aged 5-60 months with isolated pmVSDs were randomised to receive either standard open surgical or minimally invasive perventricular closure via direct entry into the ventricle with a catheter from a subxiphoid incision. The primary outcomes included complete closure at discharge , major and minor adverse events and the changes in perioperative cardiorespiratory performance from baseline. Complete closure was mainly analysed in the modified intention-to-treat ( mITT) population , with sensitivity analyses for the ITT , per-protocol ( PP) and as-treated ( AT) populations ( non-inferiority margin -5.0 %). We recruited 200 patients with pmVSDs for this study ( mean age 24.38 months , range 7-58 months , 104 girls) , of whom 100 were randomly allocated to one of the study groups. The non-inferiority of perventricular to surgical closure regarding complete closure at discharge was not shown in the ITT ( absolute difference -0.010 ( 95 % CI -0.078 to 0.058)) and mITT populations ( -0.010 ( 95 % CI -0.069 to 0.048)) , but was shown in the PP ( 0.010 ( 95 % CI -0.043 to 0.062)) and AT populations ( 0.048 ( 95 % CI -0.009 to 0.106)). Perventricular closure reduced the rate of compromising cardiac haemodynamics , electrophysiological responses , cardiomyocyte viability , respiratory mechanics , ventilatory and gas exchange function and oxygenation and tissue perfusion compared with surgical closure ( all between-group P < 0.05). For infants and young children with pmVSD , perventricular closure reduced the rate of postoperative cardiorespiratory compromise compared with surgical closure , but the non-inferiority regarding complete closure should be interpreted in the context of the specific population.
