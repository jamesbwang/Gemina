 With the growing dependence on smartphones for everyday activities , a large number of pedestrians nowadays are constantly fixated on their smartphone screens , and hence are susceptible to walking off pavements or colliding with other pedestrians. Reduced attention and situational awareness can render smartphone-occupied users , or smombies , oblivious to potential risks when using their smartphones while walking or driving. In this paper , we introduce a smartphone application , called Smombie Guardian , that detects obstacles and alerts smombies as they walk while viewing their smartphone screens to prevent potential collisions. Based on a user study with 74 participants who used Smombie Guardian in a real-life scenario , we highlight the effectiveness , usefulness , and unobtrusiveness of the algorithm and Smombie Guardian in helping users to avoid potential obstacles.
