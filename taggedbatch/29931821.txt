 Dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> affects approximately 130 countries. 25 % of infections result in febrile , self-limiting illness; heterotypic infection results in potentially fatal Dengue<pathogen><disease> Haemorrhagic Fever<symptom> or Dengue Shock<symptom> Syndrome<disease><symptom>. Only one vaccine is currently available. Its efficacy is very variable. Thus , to target Dengue<pathogen><disease> , we used an innovative immunoinformatic protocol to design a putative epitope ensemble vaccine by selecting an optimal set of highly-conserved epitopes with experimentally-verified immunogenicity. From 1597 CD4 + and MHC II epitopes , 6 MHC Class I epitopes ( RAVHADMGYW , GPWHLGKLEM , GLYGNGVVTK , NMIIMDEAHF , KTWAYHGSY , WAYHGSYEV) and 9 MHC Class II epitopes ( LAKAIFKLTYQNKVV , GKIVGLYGNGVVTTS , AAIFMTATPPGSVEA , AAIFMTATPPGTADA , GKTVWFVPSIKAGND , KFWNTTIAVSMANIF , RAIWYMWLGARYLEF , VGTYGLNTFTNMEVQ , WTLMYFHRRDLRLAA) were selected; this candidate vaccine achieved a world population coverage of 92.49 %.
