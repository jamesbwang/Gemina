 Background/ Aims: Little is known about the effect of P450 oxidoreductase ( POR) gene polymorphisms on the activities of CYPs with multiple genotypes. We genotyped 102 human livers for 18 known POR single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) with allelic frequencies greater than 1 % as well as for 27 known SNPs in 10 CYPs. CYP enzyme activities in microsomes prepared from these livers were determined by measuring probe substrate metabolism by high performance liquid chromatograph. We found that the effects of the 18 POR SNPs on 10 CYP activities were CYP genotype-dependent. The POR mutations were significantly associated with decreased overall Km for CYP2B6 and 2E1 , and specific genotypes within CYP1A2 , 2A6 , 2B6 , 2C8 , 2D6 and 2E1 were identified as being affected by these POR SNPs. Notably , the effect of a specific POR mutation on the activity of a CYP genotype could not be predicted from other CYP genotypes of even the same CYP. When combining one POR SNP with other POR SNPs , a hitherto unrecognized effect of multiple-site POR gene polymorphisms ( MSGP) on CYP activity was uncovered , which was not necessarily consistent with the effect of either single POR SNP. The effects of POR SNPs on CYP activities were not only CYP-dependent , but more importantly , CYP genotype-dependent. Moreover , the effect of a POR SNP alone and in combination with other POR SNPs ( MSGP) was not always consistent , nor predictable. Understanding the impact of POR gene polymorphisms on drug metabolism necessitates knowing the complete SNP complement of POR and the genotype of the relevant CYPs.
