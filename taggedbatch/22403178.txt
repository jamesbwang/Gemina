 Circadian clock and senescence have been shown to tightly intertwined with each other in numerous eukaryotes , but the regulation of circadian oscillator on triggering leaf senescence , and vice versa , remains largely unknown in higher plants. Very recently , circadian system and leaf senescence were found to be highly interconnected in higher plants. Circadian clock was shown to regulate leaf senescence through a few cross signaling pathways including age-dependent , plant hormone mediated , and dark induced manners to trigger the onset of leaf senescence. By contrast , circadian clock itself also can be affected by the leaves senescing process. The eventually delineating cross networks between circadian clock and leaf senescence will lay the foundation for understanding the fitness of developmental dynamics of plants with aging.
