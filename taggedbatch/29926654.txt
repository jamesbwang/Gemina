 To evaluate the level of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control in patients with coronary heart disease ( CHD) of China in order to provide guidance for the prevention and treatment of CHD. The patients with CHD were retrospectively collected from 2011 ~ 2014 in PLA General Hospital and Hainan Branch Hospital. Then analyzed the difference of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> compliance rate between different surgical methods percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) , coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG) , secondary preventive drugs ( aspirin , clopidogrel , nitrates , trimetazidine , nicorandil , hypotensor , hypoglycemic , lipid-lowering drugs) and lifestyle ( smoking , drinking , exercise). ① Effects of surgical methods on blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>: Male 's systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP) and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( DBP) in the CABG group were lower in the PCI group and control group , and female 's DBP in the CABG group were lower in the PCI group. ② Usage rate of secondary prevention drugs: usage rate of trimetazidine , calcium antagonist , β-blockers , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI) and angiotensin receptor antagonist ( ARB) in hypertension group were higher than in normal blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> group. ③ Lifestyle condition: compliance rate of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in the smoking group was lower than that in the non smoking group. And there was no significant difference in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> compliance rate among whether drinking and doing exercise or not. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control in patients with CHD was still not satisfied. Compared with PCI , CABG may be more beneficial in the control of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in patients with CHD. Smoking cessation and improving the usage rate of secondary preventive drugs are still the main means of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control.
