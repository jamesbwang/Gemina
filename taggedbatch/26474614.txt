 BACKGROUND Early diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid synovitis<symptom> can reduce the progression of rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> ( RA). However , in the early stages of rheumatoid synovitis<symptom> , patients may only have non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms , and plain film radiographs may not detect early synovial changes. The aim of this study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound with radiography , and clinical investigations in the detection of rheumatoid synovitis<symptom> in patients presenting with nonspecific musculoskeletal symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a non-randomized , cross-sectional , clinical study that included 189 patients who had nonspecific musculoskeletal symptoms. All patients underwent clinical investigations , postero-anterior and dorsal radiographic imaging , and bilateral grey-scale ultrasound examinations of the third and second metacarpophalangeal ( MCP) joints , the third and the second proximal interphalangeal ( PIP) joints , the second and the fifth metatarsophalangeal ( MTP) joints , and the wrist. RESULTS There was no clear predictive value for detection of early synovitis<symptom> by clinical investigations alone. Plain film radiography of patients only provided accurate information of joint erosions but less information for synovitis<symptom>. Grey-scale ultrasound was more effective at detecting early synovitis<symptom> compared with clinical investigations ( p = 0.00015; q = 4.548) and compared with plain film radiography ( p = 0.0002; q = 4.537) , and quantified the synovial changes. The predictive values of plain film radiography and clinical investigations had 0.43 and 0.24 sensitivity and 0 specificity compared with ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study support the use of grey-scale ultrasound in the detection of early rheumatoid synovitis<symptom> of the fingers and the wrist.
