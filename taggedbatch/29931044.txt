 The genomic architecture of human complex<disease> diseases<disease> is thought to be attributable to single markers , polygenic components and epistatic components. No study has examined the ability of tree-based methods to detect epistasis in the presence of a polygenic signal. We sought to apply decision tree-based methods , C5 .0 and logic regression , to detect epistasis under several simulated conditions , varying strength of interaction and linkage disequilibrium ( LD) structure. We , then applied the same methods to the phenotype of educational attainment in a large population cohort. LD pruning improved the power and reduced the type I error. C5 .0 had a conservative type I error rate whereas logic regression had a type I error rate that exceeded 5 %. Despite the more conservative type I error , C5 .0 was observed to have higher power than logic regression across several conditions. In the presence of a polygenic signal , power was generally reduced. Applying both methods on educational attainment in a large population cohort yielded numerous interacting SNPs; notably a SNP in RCAN3 which is associated with reading and spelling and a SNP in NPAS3 a neurodevelopmental gene. All methods used are implemented and freely available in R. Supplementary Data are available at Bioinformatics online.
