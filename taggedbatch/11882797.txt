 Tumor necrosis<symptom> factor inhibitors are the first biological agents used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> ( RA) to have yielded satisfactory results in terms of clinical improvement and radiologic progression , but they are also associated with the possibility of occurrence of a number of autoimmune systemic events ( drug-induced lupus ( DIL) , vasculitis , sarcoidosis) and localized adverse events ( uveitis , psoriasis , interstitial lung disease , erythema multiforme including the major form Stevens-Johnson syndrome<disease><symptom> ( SJS)). During treatment with TNF inhibitors , many patients develop positivity for antinuclear , antihistone and anti-double stranded DNA antibodies , though only a minority of patients will develop clinical manifestations and approximately less than 1 % will fulfill the classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus. Mucocutaneous manifestations are the most frequent manifestations of DIL following treatment with TNF inhibitors , and can be severe and occasionally difficult to differentiate from erythema multiforme/SJS. Stopping the causative drug ( the TNF inhibitor) and general supportive measures are usually sufficient in mild forms , but in moderate<symptom> to severe forms , systemic glucocorticoids and sometimes immunosuppressive drugs are required. The present report presents the case of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> who developed severe recurrent cutaneous reactions and positive autoantibodies during TNF inhibitor treatment , with difficulties in differential diagnosis and treatment. A review of the literature is also presented.
