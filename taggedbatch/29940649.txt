 The authors describe a case of a 61-year-old female patient , which presented on multidetector computed tomographic ( MDCT) angiography a gastrosplenic trunk ( GST) and common hepatic artery ( CHA) arose independently from abdominal aorta ( AA). The GST arose from the anterior wall of the AA , at the level of upper edge of the L1 vertebral body. The left gastric artery ( LGA) arose from the superior wall of the GST. The splenic artery ( SA) continuous the path of GST. The CHA arose from the anterior wall of the AA , at the level of upper one third of the L1 vertebral body , at 15.3 mm above the origin of superior mesenteric artery ( SMA). The incidence and developmental and clinical significance of this vascular variation is discussed with a detailed review of the literature.
