 Alkali/surfactant/polymer ( ASP) flooding wastewater is highly caustic , and membrane fouling is the main obstacle during ASP ultrafiltration ( UF) treatment. To maintain favorable filtration performance , polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE) and polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF) membranes<symptom> were implemented here , and their antifouling properties and mechanisms were investigated based on the threshold flux theory. Compared with the PVDF membranes<symptom> , the PTFE membranes<symptom> exhibited superior antifouling properties with lower reductions in flux and smaller hydraulic resistance , and they presented a nearly identical pseudo-stable fouling rate at a later time point. In the fouling layers of the PTFE and PVDF membranes<symptom> , anion polyacrylamide ( APAM) was observed along with divalent/trivalent metal ions. The thermodynamic and molecular mechanisms of membrane fouling by APAM were elucidated using the Extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek ( XDLVO) theory and atomic force microscopy ( AFM) , respectively. The calculated total interfacial free energy ( mJ/m
