 There are increasing demand for biomaterials with dual effects of bone regeneration and anti-infection in clinic application. To achieve this goal , chitosan microspheres with either positive or negative charges were fabricated then assembled as a gel for bone healing. The positively charged chitosan microspheres ( CSM) ( ~ 35.5 μm) and negatively charged O-carboxymethyl chitosan microspheres ( CMCSM) ( ~ 13.5 μm) were loaded respectively with bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP-2) and berberine ( Bbr) via swollen encapsulation and physical adsorption without significant change of the electric charges. The release kinetics of BMP-2 and Bbr from the microspheres was also studied in vitro. The results showed that the Bbr/CMCSM microspheres group possessed high antibacterial activity against the S.Aureus; the BMP-2/ CSM microspheres group also owned excellent cytocompatibility , and improved osteoinductivity with assistance of BMP-2. The assembled gel group consisting of Bbr/CMCSM and BMP-2/ CSM had a porous structure allowing biological signals transfer and tissue infiltration , and exhibited significantly enhanced bone reconstruction than the respective microspheres groups , which should result from the osteoconductivity of the porous structure and the osteoinduction of the BMP-2 growth factor. The oppositely charged microspheres and their assembled gel provide a promising prospect to make injectable tissue-engineered constructs with regenerative and anti-infective dual effects for biomedical applications.
