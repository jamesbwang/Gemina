 Noonan syndrome<disease><symptom> ( NS; Mendelian Inheritance in Men ( MIM) ♯ 163950) and related syndromes<disease><symptom> ( Noonan syndrome<disease><symptom> with multiple lentigines ( NS-ML , formerly called LEOPARD syndrome<disease><symptom>; MIM ♯ 151100) , Noonan-like syndrome<disease><symptom> with loose anagen hair ( NS-LAH; MIM ♯ 607721) , Costello syndrome<disease><symptom> ( CS; MIM ♯ 218040) , Cardio-Facio-Cutaneous syndrome<disease><symptom> ( CFCS; MIM ♯ 115150) , type I Neurofibromatosis ( NF1; MIM ♯ 162200) , and Legius syndrome<disease><symptom> ( LS; MIM ♯ 611431)) are a group of related genetic disorders , associating distinctive facial features , cardiopathies , growth and skeletal abnormalities , developmental delay/mental retardation , and tumor predisposition. Clinically described more than 50 years ago , disease genes have been identified throughout the three last decades , providing a molecular basis to better understand their physiopathology and to identify targets for therapeutic strategies. Most of those genes encode proteins belonging to or regulating the so-called RAS/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK) signaling pathway , so that these syndromes<disease><symptom> have been gathered under the naming Rasopathies. In this review , we will provide a clinical overview of Rasopathies and an update of their genetics. We will then focus on the functional and pathophysiological impacts of Rasopathies-causing mutations , and discuss therapeutic perspectives and future directions.
