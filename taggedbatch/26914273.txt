 Colorectal carcinoma ( CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. O-glycosylated mucins at the cell surface of colonic mucosa exhibit alterations in cancer and are involved in fundamental biological processes , including invasion and metastasis. Certain members of the GalNAc-transferase family may be responsible for these changes and are being investigated as novel biomarkers of cancer. In the present study the prognostic significance of GalNAc-T6 was investigated in patients with CRC patients. GalNAc-T6 expression was observed in all three colon cancer cell lines analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction , immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. A cohort of 81 colon cancer specimens was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining using MAb T6 .3. It was demonstrated that GalNAc-T6 was expressed in 35/81 ( 43 %) cases of colon cancer but not in the normal colonic mucosa. No association was observed with the clinical-pathologic parameters. However , patients expressing GalNAc-T6 had a significantly increased overall survival ( median , 58 months; P < 0.001) compared with GalNAc-T6 negative patients , especially those with advanced disease. These results suggest that GalNAc-T6 expression predicts an improved outcome in patients with CRC. The molecular mechanism underlying the less aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom> of colon cancer cells expressing GalNAc-T6 remains to be elucidated.
