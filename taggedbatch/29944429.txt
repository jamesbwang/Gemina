 Understanding the differential diagnosis between moisture-associated skin damage ( MASD) and pressure ulcers<disease><symptom> ( PU) ensures appropriate management and interventions are instigated at the earliest opportunity. Most damage occurring to the buttocks or sacrum is attributed to pressure , shear , excessive moisture or a combination of these factors. MASD caused by excessive moisture to the sacrum/buttock area is recognised as incontinence-associated dermatitis<disease> ( IAD); its occurrence is an identified risk factor in the development of PUs. Treatment for IAD should therefore focus on both IAD management and pressure ulcer<disease><symptom> prevention.
