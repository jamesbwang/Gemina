 This study sought to investigate predictors of procedural success and clinical outcomes in patients with tricuspid regurgitation ( TR) at increased surgical risk undergoing transcatheter tricuspid valve edge-to-edge repair ( TTVR). Recent data suggest TTVR using the edge-to-edge repair technique in patients at high surgical risk is feasible and improves functional status at short-term follow-up. TTVR was carried out in 117 patients with symptomatic TR ( median age 79.0 years ( interquartile range ( IQR): 75.5 to 83.0 years) , EuroSCORE II 6.3 % ( IQR: 4.1 % to 10.8 %) , STS mortality score 5.3 % ( IQR: 2.9 % to 7.1 %)) at 2 centers in Germany between March 2016 and November 2017. Seventy-four patients had concomitant severe mitral regurgitation and underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of both valves. During TTVR , 185 and 34 clips were implanted at the anteroseptal and posteroseptal commissures , respectively. Procedural success ( TR reduction â‰¥ 1) was achieved in 81 % of patients. Median TR effective regurgitant orifice area was reduced from 0.5 to 0.2 cm Successful TR reduction by TTVR serves as a predictor for reduced mortality and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> hospitalization. TR coaptation gap and jet location may assist in decision making whether a patient is anatomically suited for TTVR.
