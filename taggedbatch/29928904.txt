 Angiotensin I-converting enzyme ( ACE) is a well-known zinc-metallopeptidase that converts angiotensin I to the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin , a powerful vasodilator , and as such plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and cardiac function. Increased circulating ACE ( cACE) activity has been reported in multiple diseases , including but not limited to granulomatous disorders. Since 2001 , genetic mutations leading to cACE elevation have also been described. This review takes advantage of the identification of a novel ACE mutation ( 25-IVS25 + 1G > A) in two Belgian pedigrees to summarize current knowledge about the differential diagnosis of cACE elevation , based on literature review and the experience of our centre. Furthermore , we propose a practical approach for the evaluation and management of patients with elevated cACE and discuss in which cases search for genetic mutations should be considered.
