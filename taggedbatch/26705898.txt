 Healthy aging affects manual asymmetries in simple motor tasks , such as unilateral reaching and aiming. The effects of aging on manual asymmetries in the performance of a complex , naturalistic task are unknown , but are relevant for investigating the praxis system. This study examined how aging influences manual asymmetry in different contexts in a tool manipulation task. Fifty healthy , right-hand-dominant young ( N = 29; 21.41 ± 2.87 years) , and elderly ( N = 21; mean: 74.14 ± 6.64 years) participants performed a ` slicing ' gesture in response to a verbal command in two contexts: with ( tool) and without the tool ( pantomime). For interjoint relationships between shoulder plane of elevation and elbow flexion , a HAND × AGE × CONTEXT interaction existed ( F
