 In 2013 , consensus was obtained on a definition of bruxism as repetitive masticatory muscle activity characterised by clenching or grinding of the teeth and/or by bracing or thrusting of the mandible and specified as either sleep bruxism or awake bruxism. In addition , a grading system was proposed to determine the likelihood that a certain assessment of bruxism actually yields a valid outcome. This study discusses the need for an updated consensus and has the following aims: ( i) to further clarify the 2013 definition and to develop separate definitions for sleep and awake bruxism; ( ii) to determine whether bruxism is a disorder rather than a behaviour that can be a risk factor for certain clinical conditions; ( iii) to re-examine the 2013 grading system; and ( iv) to develop a research agenda. It was concluded that: ( i) sleep and awake bruxism are masticatory muscle activities that occur during sleep ( characterised as rhythmic or non-rhythmic) and wakefulness ( characterised by repetitive or sustained tooth contact and/or by bracing or thrusting of the mandible) , respectively; ( ii) in otherwise healthy individuals , bruxism should not be considered as a disorder , but rather as a behaviour that can be a risk ( and/or protective) factor for certain clinical consequences; ( iii) both non-instrumental approaches ( notably self-report) and instrumental approaches ( notably electromyography) can be employed to assess bruxism; and ( iv) standard cut-off points for establishing the presence or absence of bruxism should not be used in otherwise healthy individuals; rather , bruxism-related masticatory muscle activities should be assessed in the behaviour 's continuum.
