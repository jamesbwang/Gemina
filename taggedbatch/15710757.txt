 The relationship between aortic dissection and coronary artery disease is not clear. The purpose of this study was to clarify the difference in the rate of coronary artery atherosclerosis between Stanford type A and type B aortic dissection by reviewing our institutional database. One hundred and forty-five patients ( 78 males , 67 females; mean age: 60 ± 12 years) admitted to our hospital with acute aortic dissection who underwent coronary angiography during hospitalization from 2000 through 2002 were enrolled in this study. The background characteristics , coronary risk factors , and coronary angiography findings ( number of significant stenoses , stenoses according to Bogaty standards , extent index) of patients were compared between type A ( Group A; n = 71) and type B dissection ( Group B; N = 74). Significantly more patients had prior histories of complications from ischemic heart disease in Group B than in Group A ( P = 0.04) , with no significant differences in comparison to other risk factors observed except for hypertension. Significantly ( p = 0.005) more stenoses were observed in Group B ( 1.54 ± 0.04) than in Group A ( 0.38 ± 0.1). A significantly higher ( P < 0.05) index score indicating the severity of coronary atherosclerosis was observed in Group B ( 1.49 ± 0.09) than in Group A ( 0.72 ± 0.07). Stanford type B acute aortic dissection was significantly more frequently associated with coronary artery atherosclerosis than type A.
