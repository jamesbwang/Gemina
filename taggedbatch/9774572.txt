 Chronic periodontitis<disease> ( CP) is an infectious<disease> disease<disease> resulting in inflammation<symptom> of the supporting tissues of the teeth with progressive attachment loss and bone loss. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of 980-nm diode laser , as an adjunct to scaling and root planing ( SRP) in the management of CP. A total of 40 systemically healthy subjects diagnosed with CP were randomly assigned into two groups G1 ( SRP and sham application of laser) and G2 ( SRP and laser irradiation) with equal numbers in each. The levels of A gradual reduction in the levels of Although a 980-nm diode laser may not have any added benefit compared with SRP , it may emerge as an effective non-surgical treatment option in advanced periodontitis<disease> with complex inaccessible subgingival niches where comprehensive periodontal care may not be feasible.
