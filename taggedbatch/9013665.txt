 Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Prior to the development of these characteristic pathological hallmarks of AD , anterograde axonal transport is impaired. However , the key proteins that initiate these intracellular impairments remain elusive. The collapsin response mediator protein-2 ( CRMP-2) plays an integral role in kinesin-1-dependent axonal transport and there is evidence that phosphorylation of CRMP-2 releases kinesin-1. Here , we tested the hypothesis that amyloid-beta ( Aβ)- dependent phosphorylation of CRMP-2 disrupts its association with the kinesin-1 ( an anterograde axonal motor transport protein) in AD. We found that brain sections and lysates from AD patients demonstrated elevated phosphorylation of CRMP-2 at the T555 site. Additionally , in the transgenic Tg2576 mouse model of familial AD ( FAD) that exhibits Aβ accumulation in the brain with age , we found substantial co-localization of pT555CRMP-2 and dystrophic neurites. In SH-SY5Y differentiated neuronal cultures , Aβ-dependent phosphorylation of CRMP-2 at the T555 site was also elevated and this reduced the CRMP-2 association with kinesin-1. The overexpression of an unphosphorylatable form of CRMP-2 in neurons promoted the re-establishment of CRMP-2-kinesin association and axon elongation. These data suggest that Aβ-dependent phosphorylation of CRMP-2 at the T555 site may directly impair anterograde axonal transport protein function , leading to neuronal defects.
