 ICAP is a theory of active learning that differentiates students ' engagement based on their behaviors. ICAP postulates that Interactive engagement , demonstrated by co-generative collaborative behaviors , is superior for learning to Constructive engagement , indicated by generative behaviors. Both kinds of engagement exceed the benefits of Active or Passive engagement , marked by manipulative and attentive behaviors , respectively. This paper discusses a 5-year project that attempted to translate ICAP into a theory of instruction using five successive measures: ( a) teachers ' understanding of ICAP after completing an online module , ( b) their success at designing lesson plans using different ICAP modes , ( c) fidelity of teachers ' classroom implementation , ( d) modes of students ' enacted behaviors , and ( e) students ' learning outcomes. Although teachers had minimal success in designing Constructive and Interactive activities , students nevertheless learned significantly more in the context of Constructive than Active activities. We discuss reasons for teachers ' overall difficulty in designing and eliciting Interactive engagement.
