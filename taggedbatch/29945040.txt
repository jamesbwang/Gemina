 The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of three finishing systems based on concentrate and legume-grass pasture on beef. Steers were finished for 91 days with an exclusively whole corn grain-based ( GRAIN) diet , grazed on legume-grass pasture plus 1.4 % of body<symptom> weight of whole corn grain supplementation ( SUPP) , or grazed on legume-grass pasture ( PAST) only. Lipid and myoglobin oxidation , pH , objective color , and α-tocopherol concentrations were evaluated on M. longissimus thoracis steaks. Dietary treatments did not affect pH and minimally affected protein carbonylation. Steaks from steers fed GRAIN were less red , showed higher lipid oxidation during retail display , and higher metmyoglobin formation from day 7 to 13 when compared to PAST. Levels of α-tocopherol were higher in steaks from steers fed diets containing legume and grass. Inclusion of roughage in finishing diets is essential to maintain retail color and prevent lipid and myoglobin oxidation.
