 We examine the circular dichroism in the angular distribution of photoelectrons of triatomic model systems ionized by strong-field ionization. Following our recent work on this effect ( Paul , Yue , and Gr√§fe , J. Mod. Opt. 64 , 1104 ( 2017) JMOPEW0950-034010.1080/ 09500340.2017.1299883) , we demonstrate how the symmetry and electronic structure of the system is imprinted into the photoelectron momentum distribution. We use classical trajectories to reveal the origin of the threefolded pattern in the photoelectron momentum distribution , and show how an asymmetric nuclear configuration of the triatomic system effects the photoelectron spectra.
