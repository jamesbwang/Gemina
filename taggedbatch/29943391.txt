 Traits that undergo massive natural selection pressure , with multiple events of positive selection , are hard to find. Social behaviour , in social animals , is crucial for survival , and genetic networks involved in behaviour , such as those of serotonin ( 5-HT) and other neurotransmitters , must be the target of natural selection. Here , we used molecular analyses to search for signals of positive selection in the 5-HT system and found such signals in the M3-M4 intracellular domain of the 5-HT3A serotonin receptor subunit ( HTR3A) in primates. We detected four amino acid sites with signs of putatively positive selection ( 398 , 403 , 432 and 416); the first three showed indications of being selected in New World monkeys ( NWM , Platyrrhini) , specifically in the Callitrichinae branch. Additionally , we searched for associations of these amino acid variants with social behavioural traits ( i.e. sex-biased dispersal , dominance and social monogamy) using classical and Bayesian methods , and found statistically significant associations for unbiased sex dispersal ( 398L and 416S) , unbiased sex dominance ( 416S) and social monogamy ( 416S) , as well as significant positive correlation between female dispersal and 403G. Furthermore , we found putatively functional protein motifs determined by three selected sites , of which we highlight a ligand motif to GSK3 in the 416S variant , appearing only in Platyrrhini. 5-HT , 5-HT3A receptor and GSK3 are part of a network that participates in neurodevelopment and regulates behaviour , among other functions. We suggest that these genetic variations , together with those found in other neurotransmitter systems , must contribute to adaptive behaviours and consequently to fitness in NWMs.
