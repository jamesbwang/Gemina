 We aimed to quantify the safety and effectiveness of vedolizumab ( VDZ) when used for UC , and to identify predictors of response to treatment. Retrospective review ( May 2014-December 2016) of VICTORY Consortium data. Adults with follow-up after starting VDZ for clinically active UC were included. Primary effectiveness outcomes were cumulative rates of clinical remission ( resolution of all UC-related symptoms) and endoscopic remission ( Mayo endoscopic sub-score 0). Key secondary effectiveness outcomes included cumulative rates of corticosteroid-free remission and deep remission ( clinical remission and endoscopic remission). Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to identify independent predictors of treatment effectiveness. Non-response imputation ( NRI) sensitivity analyses were performed for effectiveness outcomes. Key safety outcomes were rates of serious infection , serious adverse events , and colectomy. We included 321 UC patients ( 71 % prior TNFα antagonist exposure , median follow-up 10 months). The 12-month cumulative rates of clinical remission and endoscopic remission were 51 % and 41 % , respectively. Corresponding rates for corticosteroid-free remission and deep remission were 37 % and 30 % , respectively. Using NRI , 12-month rates were 20 % ( n = 64/321) for clinical remission , 17 % ( n = 35/203) for endoscopic remission , 15 % ( n = 30/195) for corticosteroid-free remission , and 14 % ( n = 28/203) for deep remission. A majority of the patients without adequate follow-up at 12 months who were deemed non-responders using NRI had already achieved clinical remission ( n = 70) or a significant clinical response ( n = 36) prior to 12 months. VDZ discontinuation prior to 12 months was observed in 91 patients , for lack of response ( n = 56) , need for surgery ( n = 29) , or adverse event ( n = 6). On multivariable analyses , prior exposure to a TNFα antagonist was associated with a reduced probability of achieving clinical remission ( HR 0.53 , 95 % CI 0.38-0.75) and endoscopic remission ( HR 0.51 , 95 % CI 0.29-0.88). Serious adverse events and serious infections were reported in 6 % and 4 % of patients , respectively. Overall cumulative rates of colectomy over 12 months were 13 % , with lower rates observed in patients naive to TNFα antagonist therapy ( 2 %) than those who had been exposed to TNFα antagonists ( 19 %). In this large real-world cohort we observed that VDZ was well tolerated and effective in achieving key clinical outcomes.
