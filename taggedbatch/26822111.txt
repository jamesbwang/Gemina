 Neighborhood deprivation has been consistently linked to poor individual health outcomes; however , studies exploring the mechanisms involved in this association are scarce. The objective of this study was to investigate whether objective measures of the physical environment mediate the association between neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation and biomarkers of health in Britain. We linked individual-level biomarker data from Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Survey ( 2010-2012) to neighborhood-level data from different governmental sources. Our outcome variables were forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV Residents of poor neighborhoods and those exposed to higher pollution and less green space had worse health outcomes. However , only SO Reducing air pollution exposure and increasing access to green space may improve population health but may not decrease health inequalities in Britain.
