 Twelve actinobacterial strains were isolated from tomato rhizospheric soil from Manipur , a state in North East Indian Himalayan Region and screened for keratinolytic and plant growth promoting traits. Nine promising isolates were identified as Streptomyces<pathogen> species using partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Among the seven isolates showing chicken feather degradation activity , three keratinolytic strains RCM-SSR-2 , -6 , and -12 were found to be the most efficient feather degrading strains achieving 90 % feather weight<symptom> loss<symptom> within 48 h of incubation. They also showed maximum keratinase and soluble peptide production. Strain RCM-SSR-2 , -5 , -6 , -8 , and -11 showed positive results for all plant growth promoting traits tested. Maximum indole-3-acetic acid production was exhibited by RCM-SSR-6. Strain RCM-SSR-1 , -2 , -5 , -6 , -9 , and -11 showed antagonistic activity against three important plant pathogens. Feather hydrolysate of RCM-SSR-6 was also evaluated for in vitro seed germination test using garden pea seeds. Higher concentration of feather protein hydrolysate ( 3 mg ml
