 Here , we successfully developed a template-free way to fabricate hierarchically porous magnesium oxide ( MgO) and carefully investigated the adsorption behavior for phosphate and methyl orange ( MO). The average pore size and the percentage porosity decreased with the increase in the feeding ratio of Mg
