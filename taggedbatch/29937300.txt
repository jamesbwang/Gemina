 FFR-guided coronary intervention is recommended for patients with intermediate stenoses. However , concerns exist with this approach in anatomically prognostic disease. In this prospective , multicentre study , we consecutively enrolled patients found to have FFR negative lesions<symptom> in anatomically significant sites: left main; proximal LAD; last remaining patent vessel; and multiple vessels with concomitant impaired left ventricular systolic function ( EF < 40 %). As per recommendation , revascularisation was deferred , and patients included into a registry. The primary endpoint was MACE ( death , myocardial infarction and unplanned target lesion<symptom> revascularization). Secondary endpoints were the above individual components. Subgroup analyses were performed for clinical presentation ( stable vs. ACS) , localization of lesion<symptom> ( ostial vs. non ostial) and renal function. The registry included 292 patients with 297 deferred stenoses. After 1-year , the primary endpoint occurred in 5 % of patients , mainly driven by TLR ( 2.7 %). Cardiovascular death occurred in 0.8 % and AMI in 0.8 %. During a follow-up of 22.2 Â± 11 months , MACE occurred in 11.6 %. Cardiovascular death occurred in 1.8 % and AMI in 2.1 %. After multivariate analysis , impaired renal function ( OR 1.99; CI 95 % 1.74-5.41; p = 0.046) and ostial disease ( OR 2.88; CI 95 % 1.04-7.38; p = 0.041) were found to be predictors of MACE. Impaired renal function also predicted TLR ( OR 2.43; CI 95 % 1.17-5.02; p = 0.017). FFR-guided revascularisation deferral is safe in the majority of anatomically prognostic disease. However , further evaluation is required in the risk stratification of those patients with ostial disease and renal disease. Registered on ClinicalTrials , NCT02590926.
