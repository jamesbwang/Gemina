 To investigate whether medication self-efficacy moderates or mediates the relationship between health literacy and medication adherence. To propose a path model that illustrates the interrelated relationship between health literacy , medication self-efficacy , medication adherence , and hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c). This cross-sectional study was performed via a face-to-face survey. Factors that may influence medication adherence and HbA1c were identified from the literature review. One hundred and seventy-four participants included were â‰¥ 20 years old with diagnosed type 2 diabetes , understood English , and were prescribed at least one oral diabetes medicine. During clinic visits , a questionnaire was administered to evaluate health literacy , medication self-efficacy , and medication adherence. HbA1c values were obtained from electronic medical records. Path analyses were conducted for data analysis. Medication self-efficacy mediated but did not moderate the relationship between numeracy and diabetes medication adherence. Participants with higher numeracy skills may develop a greater level of medication self-efficacy , which in turn may result in a higher level of diabetes medication adherence and a lower level of HbA1c. Enhancing patients ' medication self-efficacy and numeracy skills may be imperative in intervention programs to improve diabetes medication adherence. An improvement in numeracy skills and medication self-efficacy is recommended to enhance diabetes medication adherence.
