 Composting operation systems are valuable sources of microorganisms and enzymes. This work reports the assessment of proteolytic enzymes from cultivable bacteria isolated from a composting facility of the São Paulo Zoo Park ( SPZPF) , São Paulo , Brazil. Three hundred bacterial isolates were obtained and identified based on 16S rRNA gene as belonging to 13 different genera. The most common genus among the isolates was Bacillus<pathogen> ( 67 %); some of which show high proteolytic activity in their culture media. Biochemical assays of hydrolytic activities using FRET peptides as substrates allowed the characterization of a repertoire of serine proteases and metalloproteases with different molecular weights secreted by Bacillus<pathogen> strains isolated from composting. Furthermore , thermostable serine and metalloproteases were detected in the composting leachate , which might be of interest for industrial applications.
