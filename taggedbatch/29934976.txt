 The primary aim of the TRIAGE-HF trial was to correlate cardiac implantable electronic device-generated heart<symptom> failure<symptom> risk status ( HFRS) with signs , symptoms , and patient behaviours classically associated with worsening heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF). TRIAGE-HF enrolled 100 subjects with systolic HF implanted with a Medtronic high-performance device and followed up at three Canadian HF centres. Study follow-up was up to 8 months. The HFRS assigned each subject 's overall risk of HF hospitalization in the next 30 days and also highlighted abnormal device parameters contributing to a patient 's risk status at the time of remote data transmission. Subjects with a high HFRS were contacted by telephone to assess symptoms , and compliance with prescribed therapies , nutrition , and exercise. Clinician-assessed risk and HFRS-calculated risk were correlated at both study baseline and exit. Twenty-four high HFRS occurrences were observed among 100 subjects. Device parameters associated with increased risk of HF hospitalization included OptiVol index ( n = 20) , followed by low patient activity ( n = 18) and elevated night<symptom> heart rate ( n = 12). High HFRS was associated with symptoms of worsening HF in 63 % of cases ( n = 15) increasing to 83 % of cases ( n = 20) when non-compliance with pharmacological therapies and lifestyle was considered. TRIAGE-HF is the first study to provide prospective data on the distribution of abnormal device parameters contributing to high HFRS. High HFRS has good predictive accuracy for patient-reported signs , symptoms , and behaviours associated with worsening HF status. As such , HFRS may be a useful tool for ambulatory HF monitoring to improve both patient-centred and health system level outcomes.
