 Maximum force exertion against various resistance levels ( heavy-light) is commonly implemented to improve both strength- and speed-oriented components of power. Medium-light resistances allow rapid accelerations , yet incur significant decelerations in the later concentric phase to bring the bar to a halt , which may limit the concentric effort and , therefore , the effectiveness of training. Accordingly , ballistic actions have been recommended. This study evaluated the effectiveness of power bench press training , with the bar thrown on a Smith machine ( BP Nine university shot-putters performed BP The peak elbow velocity during BP When undergoing power bench press against medium-light resistances , maximum ballistic actions are important strategies for improving 1RM and shot put performance of university shot-putters.
