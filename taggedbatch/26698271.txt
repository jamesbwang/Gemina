 None The nanoparticles were synthesized by utilizing an aqueous extract of The synthesized nanoparticles were crystalline with an average diameter between 12 and 18 nm for F-AuNPs and C-AuNPs and in the range of 20-40 nm for C-AgNPs. ICP-MS analysis revealed concentrations of synthesized nanoparticles as 0.7 , 4.5 and 3.6 mg/mL for F-AuNPs , C-AuNPs and C-AgNPs , respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed the presence of flavonoids , cannabinoids , terpenes and phenols on the nanoparticle surface , which could be responsible for reducing the salts to nanoparticles and further stabilizing them. In addition , the stable nature of synthesized nanoparticles has been shown by thermogravimetric analysis and ICP-MS. Finally , the AgNPs were explored for the inhibition of
