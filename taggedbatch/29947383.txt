 A simple and efficient top-down strategy , the chemical vapor etching method , is reported for synthesizing corrugated ZnO nano/micro rods ( NRs). The stabilization mechanism of this unique nanostructure has been determined through a combination of aberration-corrected field emission scanning electron microscopy , high-resolution transmission electron microscopy , and first-principles calculations. The experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical calculations , and a remarkable nonpolar-to-polar surface faceting transition is demonstrated. The corrugated-shaped structure results from the remarkable stability of the defect-induced reconstructions ( O vacancy , Zn-Zn dimer) , which makes the high-index polar ( 303 ( combining macron) 1) and ( 101 ( combining macron) 1 ( combining macron)) planes lower in energy compared to the nonpolar ( 101 ( combining macron) 0) plane. Based on the results of first-principles surface calculations , a general formula is established to provide an accurate description of the unusual size effect of the length of the corrugated unit vs. the NR diameter , and it also offers direct explanations for certain experimental observations. The present study deepens our atomic-level understanding of the detailed structure and stability of polar surface decorated corrugated ZnO NRs , and points to a viable path towards designing polar-stable wurtzite structures.
