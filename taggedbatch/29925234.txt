 This feature article addresses a variety of unique macroscopic-scale and colloidal-scale interfacial phenomena , such as wetting transitions of oil droplets into molecularly thin films , spontaneous merging and splitting of oil droplets at air-water interfaces , solid monolayer and bilayer formation in mixed cationic surfactant/alkane adsorbed films , switching of foam-film thickness , and oil-in-water emulsion stability. All of these phenomena can be observed using commercial cationic surfactants , liquid alkanes , and water.
