 Cold-season macrophytes were configured in a system of stabilization ponds ( SPs) and batch operation constructed wetlands ( BCWs) to supply a carbon source for low carbon/nitrogen ( C/N) effluent in spring and summer without generating secondary pollution during the decomposition process. For eutrophic water , the macrophyte configuration increased the average removal efficiency ( RE) from 41.6 % to 68.6 % and from 70.2 % to 83.7 % for NO
