 The molecular mechanisms of intestinal zinc resorption and its regulation are still topics of ongoing research. To this end , the application of suitable in vitro intestinal models , optimized with regard to their cellular composition and medium constituents , is of crucial importance. As one vital aspect , the impact of cell culture media or buffer compounds , respectively , on the speciation and cellular availability of zinc has to be considered when investigating zinc resorption. Thus , the present study aims to investigate the impact of serum , and in particular its main constituent serum albumin , on zinc uptake and toxicity in the intestinal cell line Caco-2. Furthermore , the impact of serum albumin on zinc resorption is analyzed using a co-culture of Caco-2 cells and the mucin-producing goblet cell line HT-29-MTX. Apically added albumin significantly impaired zinc uptake into enterocytes and buffered its cytotoxicity. Yet , undigested albumin does not occur in the intestinal lumen in vivo and impairment of zinc uptake was abrogated by digestion of albumin. Interestingly , zinc uptake , as well as gene expression studies of mt1a and selected intestinal zinc transporters after zinc incubation for 24 h , did not show significant differences between 0 and 10 % serum. Importantly , the basolateral application of serum in a transport study significantly enhanced fractional apical zinc resorption , suggesting that the occurrence of a zinc acceptor in the plasma considerably affects intestinal zinc resorption. This study demonstrates that the apical and basolateral medium composition is crucial when investigating zinc , particularly its intestinal resorption , using in vitro cell culture.
