 Coffee culture , one of the main agricultural activities in Brazil , has undergone recent negative impacts due to unfavorable climate conditions , with a subnormal rainy period and increased temperatures during the second half of 2015. The coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei ( Ferrari , 1867) ( Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is one of the main insect pests of coffee crops worldwide. The present research aimed to determine the climate zones for coffee berry borer in the state of São Paulo , based on its thermal requirements. The results showed that the mean biological development time of H. hampei was affected by temperature , completing its life cycle more rapidly in increased temperatures until the 30 °C threshold temperature , and more slowly above this temperature. Development time ( egg-adult) was inversely related to temperature in the range between 18 and 32 °C. The temperature threshold ( Tt) was 13.9 °C and the thermal constant ( K) was 299 degree-days. These laboratory estimates of thermal requirements and the Geographic Information System ( GIS) were used to generate insect life span distribution maps for São Paulo. In this state , the coffee berry borer can produce 5.09-10.53 generations annually. Higher pest incidences should coincide with both temperature increases and the availability of coffee fruit for infestation. The data obtained can be used to estimate the monthly and yearly number of generations of this pest , for use in integrated pest management programs.
