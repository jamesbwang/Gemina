 Nutritional supplements can influence outcomes for individuals undergoing major surgery , particularly in older persons whose functional reserve is limited. Accelerating recovery from total hip replacement ( THR) and total knee replacement ( TKR) may offer significant benefits. Therefore , we explored the role of nutritional supplements in improving recovery following THR and TKR. A systematic review was conducted to source randomized clinical trials that tested nutritional supplements in cohorts of THR or TKR patients. Our search yielded nine relevant trials. Intake of a carbohydrate-containing fluid is reported to improve insulin-like growth factor levels , reduce hunger , nausea<symptom> , and length of stay , and attenuate the decrease in whole-body insulin sensitivity and endogenous glucose release. Amino acid supplementation is reported to reduce muscle atrophy and accelerate return of functional mobility. One paper reported a suppressive effect of beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate , L-arginine , and L-glutamine supplementation on muscle strength loss following TKR. There is limited evidence for nutritional supplementation in THR and TKR pathways; however , the low risk profile and potential benefits to adjunctive treatment methods , such as exercise programs , suggest nutritional supplements may have a role. Optimizing nutritional status pre-operatively may help manage the surgical stress response , with a particular benefit for undernourished , frail , or elderly individuals.
