 The aim of this study was to compare the effect of different soccer-specific maximal actions ( Continuous run , Sprint , Sprint with change of direction ( Sprint COD) , Jump and Shot) upon physiological ( oxygen uptake and heart rate) and perceptual ( rating of perceived exertion ( RPE)) responses and accelerometer load. Ten moderately to well-trained male soccer players volunteered to serve as subjects in this study. A repeated within-subject design was used in which each subject was tested on five occasions on different days , one test each day , during a period of 2 weeks. Each of the five tests had a distance of 900 m and lasted 5 minutes , thus the mean speed for all five tests was 3 m/s. During the test , oxygen uptake , heart rate and accelerometer load were measured. Immediately after each test , RPE was recorded , and after the test , oxygen uptake was measured for 5 minutes while the subject sat in an upright position on a chair. In the comparison of different soccer-specific maximal actions upon physiological and perceptual responses and accelerometer load , this study found that the total accelerometer load was lowest in Sprint and Sprint COD conditions , although the physiological ( oxygen uptake and heart rate) and perceptual ( RPE) responses were highest in the respective conditions. The Jump condition experienced lower RPE than Sprint and Sprint COD but achieved the highest accelerometer load. Accelerometer load is not a valid measurement for energy costs or RPE but may function as a complementary tool to investigate the player loads during matches and training.
