 The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide ( AcmH2) reacted with ( ( η6-p-cymene) RuCl ( μ-Cl)) 2 to afford ( ( η6-p-cymene) RuCl2 ( κN-AcmH2)) , 1A , in near-quantitative yield. In methanol , 1A exists in equilibrium with 1B , being probably a coordination isomer , as established by VT 1H-EXSY NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations pointed to a higher stability of 1A with respect to 1B. ( ( η6-p-cymene) RuCl ( κ2N , N '- AcmH)) , 2 , was obtained in 86 % yield from ( ( η6-p-cymene) RuCl ( μ-Cl)) 2 and AcmH2 in the presence of NaOH. The reactions of 2 with AgNO3 ( in water) , pta/AgNO3 or pta/AgOTf/Et3N ( in methanol) afforded the nitrate-coordinated complex ( ( η6-p-cymene) Ru ( κO-NO3) ( κ2N , N '- AcmH)) , 3 , the salt ( ( η6-p-cymene) Ru ( κ2N , N '- AcmH) ( κP-pta)) NO3 , ( 4) NO3 , and the zwitterion ( ( η6-p-cymene) Ru ( κ2N , N '- Acm) ( κP-pta)) , 5 , respectively , in high yields ( pta = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphatricyclo ( 3.3.1.1) decane). The reactions of 5 with Brønsted acids yielded the protonated-pta species ( ( η6-p-cymene) Ru ( κ2N , N '- Acm) ( κP-ptaH)) X ( 6) X ( X = NO3 , TsO). All compounds were fully characterized by analytical and spectroscopic methods , and the structures of 1A , 2 and 5 were elucidated by X-ray diffraction. The stability of the compounds was investigated in aqueous media and 2 and 5 were evaluated for their cytotoxicity towards human ovarian A2780 and A2780cisR cancer cells and non-tumorigenic HEK-293 cells.
