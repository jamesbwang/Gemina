 Inflammation<symptom> is associated with an increased risk of a range of chronic<disease> diseases<disease>. A diet high in fruit and vegetables may help to reduce inflammation<symptom> , as fruit and vegetables are rich sources of antioxidants and other biologically active substances , which may improve immune function. To summarize the evidence , we executed a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the effects of fruit and/or vegetable intake on inflammatory biomarkers and immune cells in humans with different diseases and conditions. Electronic databases including PubMed , Cochrane , CINAHL , and EMBASE were systematically searched up to March 2018. Eighty-three studies were included. Of these , 71 ( 86 %) were clinical trials , and 12 were observational studies ( n = 10 cross-sectional and n = 2 cohort). Amongst the observational research , n = 10 studies found an inverse association between intakes of fruit or vegetables and inflammatory biomarkers. Similarly , the majority of the intervention studies ( 68 % , n = 48) reported beneficial effects of fruit or vegetable intake on ≥ 1 biomarker of systemic or airway inflammation<symptom>. A meta-analysis of included studies showed that fruit or vegetable intake decreased circulating levels of C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( P < 0.05) and increased the γδ-T cell population ( P < 0.05). In conclusion , this review suggests that higher intakes of fruit and vegetables lead to both a reduction in proinflammatory mediators and an enhanced immune cell profile.
