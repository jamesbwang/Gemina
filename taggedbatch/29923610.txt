 This study aimed to fabricate a denture base resin ( DBR) containing phytoncide microcapsules ( PTMCs) and determine the mechanical properties of the resin and antifungal activity. Fifty-four heat-cured rectangular DBR specimens ( 64 × 10 × 3.3 ± 0.2 mm) containing nine concentrations of PTMC between 0 and 5 % ( wt/wt) were fabricated and subjected to a three-point bending test. A phytoncide release bioassay was developed using DBR containing 0 % and 2.5 % PTMCs ( wt/wt) in a 24 well-plate assay with incubation of Porphyromonas<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> at 37 °C for 74 h. The antifungal activity of PTMCs against Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> , in a pH 5.5 acidic environment was determined in a plate assay. Flexural strength decreased with increasing PTMC concentration from 97.58 ± 4.79 MPa for the DBR alone to 53.66 ± 2.46 MPa for DBR containing 5.0 % PTMC. No release of phytoncide from the PTMCs in the DBR was detected at pH 7.4. The PTMCs had a minimal inhibitory concentration of 2.6 % ( wt/vol) against C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> at pH 5.5. PTMCs can be added to DBR 2.5 % ( wt/wt) without adversely affecting flexural strength. PTMCs released the antimicrobial agent at pH 5.5 at concentrations sufficient to inhibit the growth of the C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen>.
