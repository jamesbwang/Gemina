 We recently reported a new one-pot transformation reaction of alkynes into 9,10-diarylphenanthrene derivatives , which proceeds through efficient catalyst-free 1,2-carbobration of alkynes with 9-chloro-9-borafluorene that yields a chlorodibenzoborepin , followed by oxidative deborylation/C-C coupling of the resultant chlorodibenzoborepin. Based on new experimental observations for the catalyst-free 1,2-carboboration using diphenylaceylenes and 1Br or 1OTf as well as results from theoretical investigations , here we show how the substituent on the boron atom of 9-borafluorene affects the reactivity toward alkynes. Kinetic studies indicated that the 1,2-carboboration of diphenylaceylene with the borafluorenes can be described as a second-order reaction. The reaction rates became larger with increasing the acceptor numbers of the borafluorenes , evaluated by the Gutmann-Beckett method. Interestingly , thermodynamic parameters indicated that activation entropy term , rather than activation enthalpy term , largely contributes to the reaction rate. This result was also supported by DFT calculations. Overall , among the borafluorenes examined , 1Br exhibited the highest reactivity toward a wide variety of substituted diarylacetylenes. Similar to the case of chlorodibenzoborepin , when the dibenzoborepin obtained from 1Br or 1OTf was oxidized using FeCl3 , an efficient deborylation/C-C coupling took place to give the corresponding 9,10-diarylphenanthrene derivatives in high yields.
