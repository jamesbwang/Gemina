The effects of below-knee medical compression stockings on pulse wave velocity of young healthy volunteers. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-The effects of graduated medical compression stockings ( MCS) on cardiovascular responses are poorly investigated. A simple study was undertaken to investigate whether the application of below-knee leg MCSs with different pressures could influence aortic pulse wave velocity ( PWV) as the gold standard for aortic stiffness measurement evaluated by arteriography. Ten volunteers underwent PWV measurement at baseline , then in below-knee compression class ( ccl) 1 ( 18-21 mm Hg) , 2 ( 23-32 mm Hg) and 3 ( 34-46 mm Hg) MCSs in a consecutive manner. Baseline PWV ( mean value: 7.86 ± 1.70 m · s) was significantly reduced by ccl 1 MCSs ( mean value: 6.55 ± 0.88 m · s , p = 0.04). ccl 2 and ccl 3 stockings also notably decreased baseline PWV ( mean values: 6.63 ± 0.65 m · s , p = 0.058 and 6.62 ± 1.00 m · s , p = 0.067; respectively). The application of low compression MCSs ( ccl 1) leads to a significant decrease in PWV indicating a beneficial cardiovascular influence.
