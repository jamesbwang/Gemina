 Calcified lesions<symptom> in below-the-elbow ( BTE) arteries are common in patients with diabetes or end-stage renal disease and can lead to critical hand ischemia ( CHI). Treatment of calcified lesions<symptom> with atherectomy has proved useful in the lower extremities , however , atherectomy in the upper extremities and especially BTE , is not typically considered due to the small vessel size. We review and discuss these studies along with other CHI-related articles and also present a case of a severely calcified ulnar artery lesion<symptom> treated with orbital atherectomy and plain Chocolate balloon angioplasty.
