 Autophagy , discovered as a starvation-induced cellular recycling pathway , routes protein aggregates , damaged organelles , and pathogens to lysosomes and also supports normal tissue homeostasis. Although prior studies linked autophagy to epidermal differentiation , infection , and carcinogenesis , Wang et al. report upstream regulation of autophagy by microRNAs. Subcutaneous delivery of microRNA mimics and antagonists modulated autophagy in vivo , suggesting a novel potential therapeutic strategy in dermatology.
