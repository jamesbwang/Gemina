 Cyclometalated π-allyliridium C,O-benzoates modified by ( S)- SEGPHOS or ( S)- Cl,OMe-BIPHEP catalyze enantioselective 2-propanol-mediated reductive couplings of diverse nonmetallic allyl pronucleophiles with the acetylenic aldehyde TIPSC ≡ CCHO. Absolute stereochemistries of the resulting secondary homoallylic-propargylic alcohols were assigned using Rychnovsky 's competing enantioselective conversion method.
