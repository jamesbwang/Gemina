 The significance of complications after superficial parotidectomy remains unclear , since prospective studies are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate facial<symptom> nerve<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> and other postoperative complications after superficial parotidectomy for pleomorphic adenoma of the superficial lobe and to identify the associated risk factors. Prospective and descriptive clinical study on 79 patients undergoing formal superficial parotidectomy with the modified facelift incision , dissection of the facial<symptom> nerve and reconstruction with the superficial musculoaponeurotic system flap. Function of the facial<symptom> nerve using the House-Brackmann scale and the intra- and postoperative complications were recorded at 1 week and 1 , 3 , 6 and 12 months. A descriptive , inferential and binary logistic regression analysis were performed for the variables facial<symptom> nerve<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> , tumor size and location , clinical presentation and duration of surgery. 77.2 % of the patients presented facial paresis at 1 week , with the marginal-mandibular branch being the most commonly affected ( 64.5 %). 94.9 % recovered the facial function at 6 months and 100 % at 12 months. A statistically significant relationship was found between the appearance of facial paresis and tumor location in the superior lateral area of the superficial lobe , size > 2 cm and prolonged operative time. None of the remaining variables showed significant differences at any study timepoint. At 12 months , 57 % of patients had recovered tactile sensitivity in the earlobe. The clinical occurrence of Frey 's syndrome<disease><symptom> was 11.4 %. Despite the high incidence of postoperative facial paresis at 1 week , its magnitude was low and the recovery time was short. Tumor location in the parotid<symptom> superficial lobe upper area , size and prolonged operative time are risk factors that can worsen facial paresis at different study timepoints. The knowledge of these complications is relevant for patient 's counseling and to achieve better long-term outcomes.
