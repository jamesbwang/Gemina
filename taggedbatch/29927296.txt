 General personality traits and interests , both vocational and avocational , have long been considered intertwined constructs. Nevertheless , the linkages between personality disorder features , such as psychopathy , and interests are poorly understood. This study bridges this gap by examining how psychopathic traits relate to vocational and avocational interests , and to what extent these associations are distinctive to psychopathy as opposed to a broader pattern of general and abnormal personality traits. In a sample of 426 community participants , Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised Fearless Dominance features of psychopathy were associated with interest in a broad swath of vocational and avocational interests , whereas Self-Centered Impulsivity features were associated with realistic , artistic , enterprising , and conventional interests; most zero-order associations were in the small to medium range. Coldheartedness and the factors derived from the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale were largely unrelated to interests , although there were several notable exceptions. Narcissistic traits , as well as HEXACO ( Honesty-Humility , Emotionality , Extraversion , Agreeableness , Conscientiousness , and Openness) Honesty-Humility , Extraversion , and Openness to Experience , were also related broadly to interests. The patterns of interests associated with personality disorder traits may ultimately bear practical implications for interventions as individuals seek out positions or hobbies that suit their traits.
