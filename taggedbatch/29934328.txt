 Deregulated transforming growth factor-β ( TGFβ) signaling is a common feature of many epithelial cancers. Deletion of TGFβ receptor type 2 ( TGFBR2) in fibroblast specific protein-1 ( FSP1) positive stromal cells induces squamous cell carcinoma in the murine forestomach , implicating fibroblast-derived hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF) as the major driver of the epithelium carcinogenesis. Prior to cancer development , hyperproliferative FSP1 + fibroblasts lacking TGFBR2 accumulate in the forestomach , disrupting the regulatory signaling crosstalk with the forestomach epithelium. Here , concurrent loss in TGFBR2 and SMAD4 completely abrogates the development of forestomach cancer. Bone morphogenic protein-7 ( BMP7) was highly upregulated in forestomach cancer tissue , activating Smad1/5/8 signaling , cell proliferation and HGF production in TGFBR2 deficient FSP1 + fibroblasts. This stimulation by BMP7 was lost in the combined TGFBR2 and SMAD4 double knockout fibroblasts , which included a profound decrease in HGF expression. Thus , Smad4-mediated signaling is required to initiate epithelial carcinogenesis subsequent to TGFBR2 deletion in FSP1 + fibroblasts. These findings reveal a complex cross-talk between epithelial cells and the stroma , wherein Smad4 is required to elicit squamous cell carcinomas in the forestomach of mice with TGFBR2-deficient stromal cells.
