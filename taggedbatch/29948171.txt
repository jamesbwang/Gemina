 During Cesarean Sections , distractions which interrupt task specific activities include auditory , equipment , theatre traffic , and irrelevant communication. Aims of this study were to investigate frequency and types of distractions and to assess impact on patient safety and theatre efficiency. Prospective observational study in a London hospital in women undergoing elective and emergency Cesarean Sections. Distractions were recorded prospectively in primiparous women having uncomplicated elective and emergency Cesarean Sections over a 4 week period. Level of distraction is categorized as I: no noticeable impact on surgical team; II: ≥ 1 team member affected; and III: all members affected. Safety outcomes assessed included perioperative complications such as postpartum hemorrhage<symptom> , organ injury , postsurgical pyrexia ( first 48 h) , return to theatre , readmissions , and postdelivery anemia<symptom> < 7 g/dl. Data from 33 elective and 23 emergency cases were collected. Mean number of level II/III distractions/case was 13.20 ( ± 6.93) and number of level II/III distracting events was greater during elective compared to emergency cases ( mean 14.91 vs 12.00 , p = 0.04). In total , 17.89 % of distractions occurred during crucial part of surgery between skin incision and delivery of baby , while delays resulting from level II/III distractions accounted for 11.25 % of total operating time. There were no intra- or postoperative complications observed in the cohort of cases. Distractions did not culminate in perioperative complications , but disrupted surgeons ' task activity , prolonging mean procedure duration by 26.8 %. Recognising sources and effects of distractions will enable measures to be taken to improve theatre productivity and patient safety.
