 There is an urgent need to develop effective therapies for ischemic stroke , but the complicated pathological processes after ischemia make doing so difficult. In the current study , we identified a novel diaryl acylhydrazone derivative , A11 , which has multiple neuroprotective properties in ischemic stroke models. First , A11 was demonstrated to induce neuroprotection against ischemic injury in a dose-dependent manner ( from 0.3 to 3 Î¼M) in three in vitro experimental ischemic stroke models: oxygen glucose deprivation ( OGD) , hydrogen peroxide , and glutamate-stimulated neuronal cell injury models. Moreover , A11 was able to potently alleviate three critical pathological changes , apoptosis , oxidative stress , and mitochondrial dysfunction , following ischemic insult in neuronal cells. Further analysis revealed that A11 upregulated the phosphorylation levels of protein kinase B ( AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK) in OGD-exposed neuronal cells , suggesting joint activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K)/ AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MEK)/ ERK pathways. In rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion , single-dose administration of A11 ( 3 mg/kg per day , i.v.) at the onset of reperfusion significantly reduced the infarct volumes and ameliorated neurological deficits. Our study , for the first time , reports the anti-ischemic effect of diaryl acylhydrazone chemical entities , especially A11 , which acts on multiple ischemia-associated pathological processes. Our results may provide new clues for the development of an effective therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke.
