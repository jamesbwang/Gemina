 The diagnosis of dengue<pathogen><disease> is complex. Until recently , only specialised laboratories were able to confirm dengue infection. However , this has changed with the newly available immunochromatographic rapid tests. Early diagnosis is of great interest , and point-of-care rapid tests have been increasingly used in Brazil. Most of those tests have not undergone validation in the Brazilian population. In this context , we decided to evaluate a rapid test introduced in the Federal District ( FD). To estimate the accuracy and reliability of the SD Bioeasy Dengue<pathogen><disease> Duo rapid test and its components to detect dengue infections in a consecutive sample of symptomatic residents in the FD , Brazil. In total , 1353 venous blood samples were collected between 2013 and 2014. Two hundred and six positive samples ( cases) and 246 negative samples ( non cases) were required for sensitivity and specificity estimation , respectively; for agreement evaluation , we used 401 samples. The reference standard used was a composite of MAC-ELISA , virus isolation and real-time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR). The evaluation was conducted prospectively under field conditions in the public health units of the FD. The results for the overall accuracy of the rapid test ( NS1/IgM combined) showed 76 % sensitivity and 98 % specificity. The sensitivity for the NS1 component ( 67 %) was better than that for the IgM component ( 35 %). The positive likelihood ratio was 46 , and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.24. The reliability of the test ( NS1/IgM combined) demonstrated crude agreement of 98 % ( Kappa index 0.94). The present phase III , large-scale validation study demonstrates that the rapid test SD Bioeasy Dengue Duo has moderate sensitivity ( NS1/IgM combined) and high specificity. Therefore , the test is useful in confirming the diagnosis of dengue<pathogen><disease> , but not enough to rule out the diagnosis. Our results also suggest that Dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( DENV<pathogen>) viral load estimated through the RT-qPCR and antibody level measured through the MAC-ELISA could have had a direct influence on the accuracy of the rapid test.
