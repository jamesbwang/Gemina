 Hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for atherosclerosis that is characterized by lipid accumulation , inflammatory cell infiltration , and smooth muscle cell proliferation. It is well known that hyperlipidemia is a stimulator for endothelial dysfunction and smooth muscle cell migration during vascular disease development. Recently , it was found that vessel wall contains a variable number of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) that are quiescent in physiological conditions , but can be activated by a variety of stimuli , e.g. , increased lipid level or hyperlipidemia. Vascular MSCs displayed characteristics of stem cells which can differentiate into several types of cells , e.g. , smooth muscle cells , adipocytic , chondrocytic , and osteocytic lineages. In vitro , lipid loading can induce MSC migration and chemokines secretion. After MSC migration into the intima , they play an essential role in inflammatory response and cell accumulation during the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. In addition , MSC transplantation has been explored as a therapeutic approach to treat atherosclerosis in animal models. In this review , we aim to summarize current progress in characterizing the identity of vascular MSCs and to discuss the mechanisms involved in the response of vascular stem/progenitor cells to lipid loading , as well as to explore therapeutic strategies for vascular diseases and shed new light on regenerative medicine.
