 Our aim was to verify if procalcitonin ( PCT) measurements using the new point-of-care testing i-CHROMATM are interchangeable with those of Liaison XL. One hundred seventeen serum samples were processed sequentially on a Liaison XL and i-CHROMATM. Statistical analysis was done using the Passing-Bablok regression , Bland-Altman test , and Cohen 's Kappa statistic. Proportional and constant differences were observed between i-CHROMATM and Liaison XL. The 95 % CI of the mean bias % was very large , exceeding the maximum allowable TE % and the clinical reference change value. However , the concordance between methods at the clinical relevant cutoffs was strong , with the exception of the 0.25 ng/mL cutoff which was moderate. Our data suggest that i-CHROMATM is not interchangeable with Liaison XL. However , while the strong concordance at the clinical relevant cutoffs allows us to consider i-CHROMATM a suitable option to Liaison XL to support clinicians ' decision-making; nevertheless , the moderate agreement at the 0.25 ng/mL cutoff recommends caution in interpreting the data around this cutoff.
