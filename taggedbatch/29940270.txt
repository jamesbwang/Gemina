 Macrophages exhibit heterogeneity and plasticity and imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophages plays a critical role in atherosclerosis progression. Telomerase reverse transcriptase ( TERT) in macrophages can be activated by nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB) , but the regulation of telomerase activation on macrophages polarization remains unknown. We previously identified microRNA-216a ( miR-216a) to promote inflammation<symptom> through directly targeting the Smad3/NF-κB pathway. The present study aimed to assess whether miR-216a can regulate telomerase activity and promote macrophages polarization during atherosclerosis progression. The results verified that TERT was highly expressed in macrophages of human carotid atherosclerotic plaques. miR-216a was found to promote telomerase activation in macrophages by 4.5-fold ( P = 0.002) through the Smad3/NF-κB pathway. miR-216a also induced macrophages senescence characterized by senescence-associated-β-galactosidase activity and p53 and p16 expression. TERT overexpression promoted the transformation of M2 to M1 while this conversion was suppressed once TERT was inhibited , and the related inflammatory factors and lipid uptake ability of M1 cells were also increased by TERT.
