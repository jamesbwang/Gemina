 The ability to speak is a unique human capacity , but where is it located in our brains? This question is closely connected to the pioneering work of Pierre Paul Broca in the 1860s. Based on post-mortem observations of aphasic patients ' brains , Broca located language production in the 3rd convolution of the left frontal lobe and thus reinitiated the localizationist view of brain functions. However , contemporary neuroscience has partially rejected this view in favor of a network-based perspective. This leads to the question , whether Broca 's findings are still relevant today. In this mini-review , we discuss current and historical implications of Broca 's work by focusing on his original contribution and contrasting it with contemporary knowledge. Borrowing from Broca 's famous quote , our review shows that humans indeed `` speak with the left hemisphere ''- but Broca 's area is not the sole `` seat of articulatory language ''.
