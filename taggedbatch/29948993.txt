 Liver involvement in celiac disease ( CD) is classified into autoimmune and cryptogenic. The association between CD and autoimmune liver diseases like autoimmune hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> , primary biliary cirrhosis , and primary sclerosing cholangitis is well-established; however , the data on patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis , particularly from India , are scanty. So we did this study to find the prevalence of CD in patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis. This was a prospective observational study , involving children of less than 18 years old attending Pediatric and Gastroenterology clinic with a diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis. The patients were evaluated for CD and divided into two groups: chronic liver disease ( CLD) with CD , and CLD without CD. Both the groups were followed up for 6 months. CLD with CD group was treated with gluten-free-diet ( GFD) and CLD without CD group was followed up without any specific intervention except standard care of CLD. Out of 84 patients , 11 ( 13.1 %) were diagnosed as CLD with CD. There was an improvement in hemoglobin levels , liver function tests , and Child-Pugh score after initiation of GFD in CLD with CD group. The prevalence of CD in cryptogenic cirrhosis was 13.1 %. Screening for CD is recommended for cryptogenic cirrhosis. Hepatic functions improve with a GFD in CD patients with cirrhosis.
