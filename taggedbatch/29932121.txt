 In this paper , an investigation into detecting immunosuppressive medicine in aqueous solutions using a spectrometry-based technique is described. Using optical transmissive spectrometry , absorbance measurements in the spectra range from 250 nm to 1000 nm were carried out for different cyclosporine A ( CsA) concentrations in aqueous solutions. The experiment was conducted for samples both with and without interferent substances-- glucose and sodium chloride. Using a dedicated algorithm , the measured data was analyzed and a high correlation coefficient R Â² = 0.8647 was achieved. The experiment showed that the described technique allowed for the detection of various CsA concentration levels in a selective , label-free and simple way. This method could be used in medicine , veterinary medicine and laboratory diagnostics.
