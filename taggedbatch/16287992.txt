 We present particle tracking microrheology results on human mucins , isolated from normal surface and gland mucosa and one tumor sample , and examine the motility of Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> in these mucins. At 1.5 % concentration human mucin solutions are purely viscous , with viscosity η ( gland mucin) > η ( surface mucin) > η ( tumor mucin). In the presence of motile H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> bacteria , particle diffusion is enhanced , with diffusivity D
