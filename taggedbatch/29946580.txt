 An X-ray diffraction study of ( 6) cycloparaphenylene ( 1) , crystallized under solvent-free conditions , revealed a unique solid state structure with tight packing of individual molecules that minimizes empty internal space. The controlled chemical reduction of this highly strained nanohoop with Group 1 metals resulted in the first isolation and structural characterization of its mono- and dianions , allowing for the evaluation of core transformations for the series ranging from 10 to 11- and 12-.
