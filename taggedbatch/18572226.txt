 Fallopian tube carcinoma is a rare female genital cancer with no specific clinical and surgical features. It is hardly diagnosed on imaging due to non-specific presentation. Laparoscopy has been recommended as the diagnostic procedure for the assessment of suspicious ovarian and adnexal masses. However , it has brought new complications like tumor recurrences at the trocar insertion sites , called port-site metastasis ( PSM). A 65-year-old , postmenopausal woman presented to hospital with loss of appetite<symptom> , Ultrasound showed ill-defined pelvic mass. The patient was diagnosed with fallopian tube carcinoma by a diagnostic laparoscopy. The PSM as a primary complication following diagnostic laparoscopy of fallopian tube carcinoma , which is presumed by positron emission tomography/computed tomography and confirmed by Nodule<disease> resection and further pathological assessment. As port-site metastasis was suspected , the patient was advised to undergo umbilical mass resection. the patient has no signs of recurrence was detected 20 months after the last surgery during follow-up. Laparoscopy plays a significant role in the diagnose and treatment of fallopian tubal and ovarian malignancies but has a risk of PSM occurrence. When isolated PSM occurs the management should be local resection.
