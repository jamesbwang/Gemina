 Mohs micrographic surgery ( MMS) , a specialized surgical excision technique used primarily in the treatment of skin cancers , is tissue sparing and provides optimal margin control through evaluation of 100 % of both the peripheral and deep margin. The use of MMS for the treatment of malignant melanoma ( MM) and melanoma in situ ( MIS) has been slow in gaining the same widespread acceptance that it has for keratinocyte carcinomas despite its cost-effectiveness and the growing body of evidence demonstrating similar or improved cure rates to standard wide local excision. However , modern advances in immunohistochemical staining have continued to greatly enhance the ability of Mohs surgeons to interpret MMS frozen sections of melanoma specimens- the primary concern of most opponents of MMS for melanoma. These advances , coupled with an increased recognition by professional organizations of the utility of MMS in treating MM and MIS , have led to a rise in the use of MMS for melanoma in recent years. Given the expanding role of MMS in the treatment of cutaneous melanoma , this manuscript will describe how MMS is performed , discuss the rationale and current evidence regarding the use of MMS for MM and MIS , review the immunohistochemical stains currently available for use in MMS , and consider special situations and future directions in this area of growing interest.
