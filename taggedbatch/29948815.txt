 Potentially inappropriate prescribing ( PIP) may contribute to opioid overdose. To examine the association between PIP and adverse events. Cohort study. Three million seventy-eight thousand thirty-four individuals age ≥ 18 , without disseminated cancer , who received prescription opioids between 2011 and 2015. We defined PIP as ( a) morphine equivalent dose ≥ 100 mg/day in ≥ 3 months; ( b) overlapping opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions in ≥ 3 months; ( c) ≥ 4 opioid prescribers in any quarter; ( d) ≥ 4 opioid-dispensing pharmacies in any quarter; ( e) cash purchase of prescription opioids on ≥ 3 occasions; and ( f) receipt of opioids in 3 consecutive months without a documented pain diagnosis. We used Cox proportional hazards models to identify PIP practices associated with non-fatal opioid overdose , fatal opioid overdose , and all-cause mortality , controlling for covariates. All six types of PIP were associated with higher adjusted hazard for all-cause mortality , four of six with non-fatal overdose , and five of six with fatal overdose. Lacking a documented pain diagnosis was associated with non-fatal overdose ( adjusted hazard ratio ( AHR) 2.21 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 2.02-2.41) , as was high-dose opioids ( AHR 1.68 , 95 % CI 1.59-1.76). Co-prescription of benzodiazepines was associated with fatal overdose ( AHR 4.23 , 95 % CI 3.85-4.65). High-dose opioids were associated with all-cause mortality ( AHR 2.18 , 95 % CI 2.14-2.23) , as was lacking a documented pain diagnosis ( AHR 2.05 , 95 % CI 2.01-2.09). Compared to those who received opioids without PIP , the hazard for fatal opioid overdose with one , two , three , and ≥ four PIP subtypes were 4.24 , 7.05 , 10.28 , and 12.99 ( test of linear trend , p < 0.001). PIP was associated with higher hazard for all-cause mortality , fatal overdose , and non-fatal overdose. Our study implies the possibility of creating a risk score incorporating multiple PIP subtypes , which could be displayed to prescribers in real time.
