 To assess the efficacy and safety profile of the dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin in a population of self-identified Hispanic/Latino patients with type 2 diabetes. Data were pooled from ten randomized , double-blind studies in which subjects were treated with sitagliptin 100 mg/day ( as mono- or combination therapy) or placebo , and used to evaluate the glycemic efficacy , safety , and tolerability of sitagliptin compared with placebo after 24 weeks of treatment. A total of 804 Hispanic/Latino patients were included in the analysis. Baseline characteristics in the treatment groups were similar ( mean baseline HbA1c of approximately 8.5 %). The LS mean HbA1c changes from baseline were- 0.94 % with sitagliptin and- 0.32 % with placebo , and the between-group difference was- 0.62 % , p < 0.001. After 24 weeks of treatment , 35 % and 18 % of subjects were at the HbA1c goal of < 7 % in the sitagliptin and placebo groups , respectively. Body<symptom> weight increased slightly in both treatment groups. Incidences of adverse events of hypoglycemia were similar and low ( 1.9 % and 1.4 % for sitagliptin and placebo , respectively) in both groups in studies in which insulin or sulfonylurea were not used and were similar ( 9 % and 11 % for sitagliptin and placebo , respectively) when all studies were included. Overall safety and tolerability of treatment with sitagliptin and placebo were similar. No clinically meaningful differences between the safety profile of sitagliptin in the Hispanic/Latino population analyzed here and broader populations previously evaluated were observed. In this pooled analysis of sitagliptin therapy vs placebo in Hispanic/Latino patients , sitagliptin provided significant improvement in glycemic control and was generally well tolerated.
