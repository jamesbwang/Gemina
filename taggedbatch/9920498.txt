 Glaucoma is a major cause of visual impairment characterized by progressive retinal neurodegeneration. Circular RNAs are a class of endogenous noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in eukaryotes. In this study , we investigated the role of cZNF609 in retinal neurodegeneration induced by glaucoma.
