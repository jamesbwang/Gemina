 Unintentional non-fire-related ( UNFR) carbon monoxide ( CO) poisoning<disease> is a leading cause of poisoning<disease> in the US and a preventable cause of death. We generated national estimates of accidental CO poisoning<disease> and characterized the populations most at risk. UNFR CO poisoning<disease> cases were assessed using hospitalization and emergency department ( ED) data from the Healthcare Costs and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample and Nationwide Emergency Department Sample databases. We used hospitalization data from 2003 to 2013 and ED data from 2007 to 2013. We calculated trends using a linear regression of UNFR CO poisonings<disease> over the study period and age-adjusted rates using direct standardization and U.S. Census Bureau estimates. During 2003-2013 , approximately 14,365 persons ( 4.1 cases/million annually) with confirmed or probable UNFR CO poisoning<disease> were admitted to hospitals and the annual rate of poisonings<disease> showed a weak downward trend ( p = 0.12). During 2007-2013 , approximately 101,847 persons ( 48.3 visits/million annually) visited the ED and the annual rate of poisonings<disease> showed a significant downward trend ( p â‰¤ 0.01). Most UNFR CO hospital cases involved patients who were older ( aged 45-64 years) , white , male , or living in the South or Midwest. Overall , the rate of hospitalizations did not change over the study period. Unintentional CO poisoning<disease> is preventable and these cases represent the most recent national estimates. ED visits declined over the study period , but the hospitalization rates did not change. This emphasizes the need for prevention efforts , such as education in the ED setting , increased use of CO alarms , and proper use and maintenance of fuel-powered household appliances.
