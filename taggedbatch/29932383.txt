 OBJECTIVE Meningiomas that appear hypervascular on neuroimaging could be amenable to preoperative embolization. However , methods for measuring hypervascularity have not been described , nor has the benefit of preoperative embolization been adjudicated. The objective of this study was to show a relationship between flow void volume ( measured on MRI) and intraoperative estimated blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( EBL) in nonembolized meningiomas. METHODS The authors performed volumetric analyses of 51 intracranial meningiomas ( 21 preoperatively embolized) resected at their institution. Through the use of image segmentation software and a voxel-based segmentation method , flow void volumes were measured on T2-weighted MR images. This metric was named the Meningioma Vascularity Index ( MVI). The primary outcomes were intraoperative EBL and perioperative blood transfusion. RESULTS In the nonembolized group , the MVI correlated with intraoperative EBL when controlling for tumor volume ( r = 0.55 , p = 0.002). The MVI also correlated with perioperative blood transfusion ( point-biserial correlation ( r
