 Major depressive disorder ( MDD) has been associated with abnormalities in cortical thickness and autonomic function. Adolescence is a time notable for brain development and MDD onset. In healthy adolescents , greater resting state vagal activity ( RVA) is associated with lower cortical thickness. The relationship between brain structural thickness and RVA in adolescents with MDD has not previously been studied. This secondary analysis drew on a sample of 37 non-depressed controls and 53 adolescents with MDD. Resting state heart rate and two indices of RVA ( HF-HRV and RMSSD) were recorded during a neuroimaging session. Cortical thickness within fronto-limbic regions of interest was measured using Freesurfer analysis of T1-weighted high-resolution structural images. Self-reports of depression<symptom> severity showed a significant interaction with cortical thickness of the right insula in predicting RMSSD ( t = 2.22 , p = .030 , β = 5.44; model fit of the interaction term as indicated by the Bayes Factor ( BF): 7.58) and HF-HRV ( t = 2.09 , p = .041 , β = 4.72; BF: 7.94). Clinician ratings of depression<symptom> severity showed further interactions. Findings underscore the important relationships between RVA and cortical development , suggesting two possible explanations: ( 1) in adolescent MDD , greater fronto-limbic thickness is compensatory for deficits in autonomic regulation; or ( 2) increased autonomic arousal results in delayed fronto-limbic maturation. Longitudinal research is necessary to further clarify the nature of the relationship between autonomic functioning and cortical development.
