 There is a common expression in sports , that there is no ` i ' in team. However , there is also a very important ` i ' in sports teams- the individual athlete/player. Each player has his/her own unique characteristics including physical , physiological and psychological traits.

The aim of this commentary is to highlight how four high-performance teams from various professional football codes are analysing individual player data.
