 The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC) is considered to play a crucial role in many high-level functions , such as cognitive control and emotional regulation. Many studies have reported that the DLPFC can be activated during the processing of emotional information in tasks requiring working memory. However , it is still not clear whether modulating the activity of the DLPFC influences emotional perception in a detection task. In the present study , using transcranial direct-current stimulation ( tDCS) , we investigated ( 1) whether modulating the right DLPFC influences emotional face processing in a detection task , and ( 2) whether the DLPFC plays equal roles in processing positive and negative emotional faces. The results showed that anodal tDCS over the right DLPFC specifically facilitated the perception of positive faces , but did not influence the processing of negative faces. In addition , anodal tDCS over the right primary visual cortex enhanced performance in the detection task regardless of emotional valence. Our findings suggest , for the first time , that modulating the right DLPFC influences emotional face perception , especially faces showing positive emotion.
