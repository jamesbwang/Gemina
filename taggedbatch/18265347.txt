 Cis-regulatory elements ( CREs) play a pivotal role in spatiotemporal control of tissue-specific gene expression , yet the molecular composition of the vast majority of CREs in native chromatin remains unknown. In this article , we describe the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR) affinity purification in situ of regulatory elements ( CAPTURE) approach to simultaneously identify locus-specific chromatin-regulating protein complexes and long-range DNA interactions. Using an in vivo biotinylated nuclease-deficient Cas9 ( dCas9) protein and programmable single guide RNAs ( sgRNAs) , this approach allows for high-resolution and locus-specific isolation of protein complexes and long-range chromatin looping associated with single copy CREs in mammalian cells. Unbiased analysis of the compositional structure of developmentally regulated or disease-associated CREs identifies new features of transcriptional regulation. Hence , CAPTURE provides a versatile platform to study genomic locus-regulating chromatin composition in a mammalian genome. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
