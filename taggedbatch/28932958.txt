 This study describes the determination of trace levels of copper by slotted quartz tube atomic absorption spectrometry after dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction. A ligand synthesized from the reaction of salicylaldehyde and 1-naphthylamine was used to form coordinate copper complex prior to extraction. All parameters that influence the output of complex formation , extraction , and instrumental measurement were optimized to enhance the absorbance signal of copper. Under the optimum conditions , about 104-fold enhancement in sensitivity was recorded over the conventional flame atomic absorption spectrometer , corresponding to a 0.51 ng/mL detection limit. The percent relative standard deviation calculated for the lowest concentration ( 4.8 %) indicated high precision for the experimental procedure. Accuracy and applicability of the optimum method were determined by performing spiked recovery tests on urine , lake water , and mineral water samples. Satisfactory recovery results were obtained between 82.2 and 106.3 % at four different concentrations. Matrix matching method was also performed to increase the accuracy of quantification , and the percent recovery calculated for 175 ng/mL was 105.14 %.
