 Acute lung injury ( ALI) is one of major causes of morbidity and mortality in intensive care. In pathophysiological events of ALI , endothelial surface layer ( ESL) injury can result in capillary leakage as the initial event. The `` Fusu agent '' , a traditional Chinese medicine , can inhibit inflammatory factors , attenuate lung capillary leak as seen in our previous study. This study was aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of Fusu agent treatment with ALI. Consistent with previous studies , we found that Fusu agent has the protective effect on LPS-induced ALI model rats. Further investigation demonstrated that heparanase activation is necessary for the LPS-induced ALI model to aggravate ESL loss. Fusu agent can inhibit heparanase activation and heparan sulfate proteoglycans ' ( HSPGs) degradation to mitigate the ESL injury. Furthermore , TNF-Î± and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1) were significantly reduced upon Fusu agent pre-treatment to inhibit inflammatory cell influx and neutrophil adhesion in ALI. These findings shed light on the pharmacologic basis for the clinical application of traditional Chinese medicine in treating ALI.
