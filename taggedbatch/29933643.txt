 While fatigue<symptom> is prevalent in chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , the neural mechanisms underlying this symptom remain unknown. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) has the potential to enable us to characterize this symptom. The aim of this review was to gather and appraise the current literature on MRI studies of fatigue<symptom> in chronic<disease> diseases<disease>. We systematically searched the following databases: MedLine , PsycInfo , Embase and Scopus ( inception to April 2016). We selected studies according to a predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We assessed the quality of the studies and conducted descriptive statistical analyses. We identified 26 studies of varying design and quality. Structural and functional MRI , alongside diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI) and functional connectivity ( FC) studies , identified significant brain indicators of fatigue<symptom>. The most common regions were the frontal lobe , parietal lobe , limbic system and basal ganglia. Longitudinal studies offered more precise and reliable analysis. Brain structures found to be related to fatigue<symptom> were highly heterogeneous , not only between diseases , but also for different studies of the same disease. Given the different designs , methodologies and variable results , we conclude that there are currently no well-defined brain indicators of fatigue<symptom> in chronic<disease> diseases<disease>.
