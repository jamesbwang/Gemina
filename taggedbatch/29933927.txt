 To examine the relationship between volume of residual disease and oncologic outcomes among patients with advanced-stage epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal carcinoma undergoing primary debulking surgery ( PDS). For patients that did not undergo a complete surgical resection ( CSR) , a surrogate for volume of residual disease was used to assess oncologic outcomes. Medical records of patients with FIGO stage IIIC and IV epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal carcinoma undergoing PDS between January 2010 and November 2014 were reviewed. Patient demographics , operative characteristics , residual disease , anatomic site of residual disease and outcome data were collected. Among patients who did not undergo CSR , but had ≤ 1 cm of residual disease , the number of anatomic sites ( single location vs. multiple locations) with residual disease was utilized as a surrogate for volume of residual disease. The effect of residual disease volume on progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) was evaluated. Of 240 patients undergoing PDS , 94 ( 39.2 %) had CSR , 41 ( 17.1 %) had ≤ 1 cm of residual disease confined to a single anatomic location ( ≤ 1 cm-SL) , 67 ( 27.9 %) had ≤ 1 cm of residual disease in multiple anatomic locations ( ≤ 1 cm-ML) and 38 ( 15.8 %) were sub-optimally ( SO) debulked. Median PFS for CSR , ≤ 1 cm-SL , ≤ 1 cm-ML and SO-debulked were: 23 , 19 , 13 and 10 months , respectively ( p < 0.001). Median OS for CSR , ≤ 1 cm-SL , ≤ 1 cm-ML and SO-debulked were: Not yet reached , 64 , 50 and 49 months , respectively ( p = 0.001). Following PDS , CSR and ≤ 1 cm-SL patients have the best prognosis. In contrast , despite being considered `` optimally debulked '' , ≤ 1 cm-ML patients have survival similar to those SO-debulked.
