 The new TomoDirect ( TD) modality offers a nonrotational option with discrete beam angles. We aim to compare dosimetric parameters of TD , helical tomotherapy ( HT) , volumetric-modulated arc therapy ( VMAT) , and fixed-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( ff-IMRT) for upper thoracic esophageal carcinoma ( EC). Twenty patients with cT2-4N0-1M0 upper thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC) were enrolled. Four plans were generated using the same dose objectives for each patient: TD , HT , VMAT with a single arc , and ff-IMRT with 5 fields ( 5F). The prescribed doses were used to deliver 50.4 Gy/28F to the planning target volume ( PTV50 .4) and then provided a 9 Gy/5F boost to PTV59 .4. Dose-volume histogram ( DVH) statistics , dose uniformity , and dose homogeneity were analyzed to compare treatment plans. For PTV59 .4 , the D All techniques are able to provide a homogeneous and highly conformal dose distribution. The TD technique is a good option for treating upper thoracic EC involvement. It could achieve optimal low dose to the lungs and spinal<disease> cord with acceptable PTV coverage. HT is a good option as it could achieve quality dose conformality and uniformity , while TD generated superior conformality.
