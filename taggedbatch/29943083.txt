 Cognitive decline is among the most devastating age-related conditions and is rapidly becoming an important cause of disease burdens worldwide. New strategies for the prevention and management of cognitive decline are needed. Resveratrol , a polyphenolic compound , has been found to enhance brain health through multiple signaling pathways. Optimal SIRT1 activation is the most crucial step in the neuroprotection provided by resveratrol against cognitive impairment. This review discusses several recent developments in our understanding of the mechanisms by which resveratrol delay age-related cognitive decline through SIRT1. The regulatory mechanisms include anti-oxidative , anti-inflammatory , anti-apoptotic processes and autophagy regulation , as well as increases in cerebral blood flow and improvements in the plasticity of synaptic pathways. Resveratrol , as well as novel SIRT1 activators , is likely to provide promising therapeutic strategies for impeding cognitive decline , repairing brain functions , and supporting healthy aging.
