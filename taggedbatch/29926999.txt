 The CZEch Mental health Study ( CZEMS) was launched to inform the ongoing mental health care reform. This paper describes rationale , methods , and the plan for the future analyses of this project. A cross-sectional survey on a representative sample of the general adult noninstitutionalized population of the Czech Republic was conducted. Two-stage sampling was utilized and respondents were interviewed by centrally trained staff using a paper and pencil interviewing. The presence of mental disorders was assessed by The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The study also collected information about disability , self-identification of having a mental illness , medical history , and help-seeking behaviour. This survey had a 75 % response rate , and the final sample consisted of 3,306 persons aged from 18 to 96 years ( mean age 49 years old , 54 % women) that were interviewed in their homes. The final sample is representative for the Czech Republic in terms of age , gender , education , and region. CZEMS will provide up-to-date evidence about a prevalence of mental disorders in the Czech Republic , associated disability , and treatment gap. This will help informed decision-making about the current mental health care reform and future mental health care development in the Czech Republic.
