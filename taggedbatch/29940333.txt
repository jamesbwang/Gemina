 To test the relative roles of perforin ( pfp) vs. FasL in CTL control of autoreactive B cell expansion , we used the parent-into-F1 model of murine graft-vs.- host disease in which donor CD8 CTL prevent lupus like disease by eliminating activated autoreactive B cells. F1 mice receiving either pfp or FasL defective donor T cells exhibited an intermediate short-term phenotype. Pairing of purified normal CD4 T cells with either pfp or FasL defective CD8 T cell subsets resulted in impaired host B cell elimination and mild lupus like disease that was roughly equivalent in the two experimental groups. Thus , in addition to major roles in tumor and intracellular pathogen control , pfp mediated CD8 CTL killing plays a significant role in controlling autoreactive B cell expansion and lupus downregulation that is comparable to that mediated by FasL killing. Importantly , both pathways are required for optimal elimination of activated autoreactive B cells.
