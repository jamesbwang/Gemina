 β-Klotho ( encoded by Klb) is an obligate co-receptor mediating both fibroblast growth factor ( FGF) 15 and FGF21 signaling. Klb-/- mice are refractory to metabolic FGF15 and FGF21 action and exhibit derepressed ( increased) bile acid ( BA) synthesis. Here , we deeply phenotyped male Klb-/- mice on a pure C57BL/6J genetic background fed a chow diet , focusing on metabolic aspects. This aims to better understand the physiological consequences of concomitant FGF15 and FGF21 signaling deficiency , in particular on the gut-liver axis. Klb-/- mice present permanent growth restriction independent of adiposity and energy balance<symptom>. Klb-/- mice also exhibit few changes in carbohydrate metabolism , combining normal gluco-tolerance , insulin sensitivity and fasting response with increased gluconeogenic capacity and decreased glycogen mobilization. Livers of Klb-/- mice reveal pathologic features , including a pro-inflammatory status and initiation of fibrosis<disease>. These defects are associated to a massive shift in BA composition in the enterohepatic system and blood circulation featured by a large excess of microbiota-derived deoxycholic acid ( DCA) , classically known for its genotoxicity in the gastrointestinal tract. In conclusion , β-Klotho is a gatekeeper of hepatic integrity , through direct action ( mediating FGF21 anti-inflammatory signaling) and indirect mechanisms ( mediating FGF15 signaling that maintain BA level and composition).
