 Interactions with resident species can affect the rate that expanding species invade novel areas. These interactions can be antagonistic ( biotic resistance) , where resident species hinder invasive establishment , or facilitative ( biotic assistance) , where residents promote invasive establishment. The predominance of resistance or assistance could vary with the abiotic context. We examined how the effects of a resident ecosystem engineer interact with abiotic stress to resist or assist the establishment of an expanding competitor. In Florida salt marshes , native cordgrass , Spartina alterniflora , is an influential ecosystem engineer that , when dead , exerts a legacy effect by forming persistent wrack patches. We examined how the legacy effect of Spartina wrack varies with spatial context and abiotic conditions to influence establishment of the northward-expanding black mangrove , Avicennia germinans. Field surveys documented that Spartina wrack and Avicennia propagules co-occur in the high intertidal zone , and we conducted two outdoor mesocosm experiments to investigate this association. Wrack positively affected propagule establishment when propagules were beneath wrack , but negatively affected establishment when propagules were above wrack. The abiotic tidal regime influences the magnitude of wrack effects by controlling ambient moisture , and the positive and negative effects of wrack were stronger in low moisture conditions that simulated desiccation stress during harsh neap tides. Thus , the same resident engineer can either resist or assist an expanding competitor and the magnitude of these effects depends on abiotic conditions. We propose that under harsh conditions , there is greater scope for an engineer 's mediating influence to affect associated species , both positively and negatively.
