 Recently , circular RNA ( circRNA) is identified as a novel class of noncoding RNA with important roles in human<disease> diseases<disease> , such as cancer. However , how circRNA participates in colorectal cancer ( CRC) remains unclear. In this study , we aimed to illustrate the role of circ_0026344 in CRC progression. We showed that circ_0026344 expression was downregulated in CRC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Moreover , the level of circ_0026344 was inversely correlated with CRC advance and lymphoid node metastasis. Additionally , circ_0026344 low expression predicted poor prognosis in CRC patients. We identified circ_0026344 as a miRNA sponge for microRNA-21 ( miR-21) and microRNA-31 ( miR-31) whose expression levels were elevated in CRC tissues. And the level of circ_0026344 was reversely correlated with both miR-21 and miR-31 levels in CRC tissues. Functionally , we found that ectopic expression of circ_0026344 decreased the growth and invasion of CRC cells while promoting apoptosis in vitro. The xenograft experiment indicated that circ_0026344 overexpress led to CRC growth inhibition in vivo. Rescue assays further demonstrated that circ_0026344 exerted biological functions by sponging miR-21 and miR-31 in CRC. In conclusion , this study revealed that circ_0026344/ miR-21/ miR-31 regulatory signaling was implicated in CRC progression.
