 Locoregional recurrence in the pelvis after definitive treatment for rectal cancer can lead to significant morbidity. Furthermore , the toxicity associated with reirradiation may also negatively impact the quality of life and even survival. Here we present the case of a 39-year-old male with locoregionally recurrent rectal cancer in a left pelvic sidewall lymph node , treated with stereotactic magnetic resonance ( MR)- guided ablative radiotherapy after previously receiving long-course chemoradiation that had already exceeded ideal bowel dose constraints. We discuss the distinct advantages of MR-guidance in the setting of pelvic reirradiation , particularly with regard to inter- and intra-fraction visualization of the target and neighboring bowel anatomy. In this context , MR-guidance may allow radiation oncologists to increase target precision and accuracy , while simultaneously decreasing toxicity to neighboring tissues.
