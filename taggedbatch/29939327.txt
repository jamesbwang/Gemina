 In radiation protection , the quantity ambient dose equivalent , in short H * ( 10) , is very important in the field of area dosimetry , because this quantity is used to estimate the effective dose to human beings , whose permissible limits are restricted by law. The conversion coefficient from air kerma to H * ( 10) , valid for a 137Cs photon field , is essential as it enters the realization of the quantity H * ( 10) as well as every ( directly or indirectly) related calibration. The basic calibration factor of any dose rate instrument is usually related to a calibration in a 137Cs photon field , which underlines the importance of the conversion coefficient discussed in this article. Because different values of this coefficient are used in different calibration facilities , a harmonized best value will be proposed based on detailed investigations on the origin of the values recommended in the past. The newly recommended value differs by almost 1 % from the value used by most institutes , at the moment , which is large in comparison with the typical uncertainties in primary fields. The goal of this article is to interpret known ICRU/ICRP data adequately , not to calculate new data.
