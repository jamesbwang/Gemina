 Adenomatous polyposis coli<pathogen> ( APC) is a large protein with multiple binding partners , suggesting diverse functions besides its well-known role in the destruction of Î²-catenin. To elucidate these complex functions , it is crucial to evaluate the precise subcellular distribution of APC within a cell and tissue. However , most of the commercially available anti-APC antibodies can only be used for limited applications , resulting in the use of independently generated antibodies. This has led to various discrepancies between studies as a common antibody has not been established. In this study , we generated an antibody against the c-terminal domain of human APC , designated APC-C antibody , and evaluated its specificity and application in various immunological methods. Our data indicate that this novel APC-C antibody is a specific and versatile antibody that can be used in western blotting , immunoprecipitation , immunocytochemistry , and immunohistochemistry. Widespread use of this APC antibody will help enhance our understanding of APC 's function in both normal and cancer cell biology.
