 To evaluate the comprehensive technical efficiency of the tertiary public hospitals in Beijing between 2006 and 2015 and explore its influencing factors , so as to propose corresponding policy suggestions. The data envelopment analysis was employed to evaluate the comprehensive technical efficiency , pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency of the tertiary public hospitals in Beijing. Malmquist index model was used to analyze the changes of the above three dynamic efficiencies. Finally , random effect panel tobit model was utilized to analyze the influencing factors of the comprehensive technical efficiency. The average comprehensive technical efficiency and pure technical efficiency of the tertiary public hospitals in Beijing were relatively high , and they had respectively increased from 0.44 and 0.51 in 2006 to 0.62 and 0.68 in 2015 , and the highest proportion of two kinds of efficiency values was between 0.5 and 0.8. Most of the scale efficiency values distributed between 0.8 and 1.0 , and the majority of hospitals were in a state of decreasing returns to scale. The total factor productivity of hospitals had been increasing at an average rate of 5.78 % per year due to the double progress of technical efficiency and technology at annual rates of 3.77 % and 1.94 % respectively , further decomposing technological efficiency change , and the pure technical efficiency change increased at the speed of 3.21 % per year , and the annual average rate of progress in scale efficiency was only 0.53 %. The comprehensive technical efficiency was positively correlated with the turnover rate of beds , annual visits per doctor , the ratio of doctors to nurses , and negatively correlated with the number of beds , the ratio of outpatients to inpatients , the proportion of medical technical personnel , and the proportion of drugs. Future health policies should strictly control the scale of tertiary public hospitals , pay attention to the innovation and application of hospital technology , change the hospital internal management le vel and management model , promote refined management , and achieve sustainable development.
