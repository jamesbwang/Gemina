 Gallium sulphide ( GaS) , gallium selenide ( GaSe<disease>) , and gallium telluride ( GaTe) , belonging to the group-III monochalcogenide family , have shown promising optoelectronic performance over graphene and monolayer molybdenum disulphide ( MoS2). However , to date , the mechanical properties of these materials have not been investigated , which hinders their utilisation in flexible electronics and optomechanics. Here , we characterize the elastic properties and breaking strengths of suspended two-dimensional ( 2D) nanosheets of GaS , GaSe<disease> , and GaTe , using atomic force microscopy. The 2D Young 's modulus values of ∼ 10 nm thick GaS , GaSe<disease> , and GaTe were found to be 1732 ± 154 N m-1 , 819 ± 127 N m-1 , and 246 ± 160 N m-1 , respectively , corresponding to the three-dimensional ( 3D) Young 's modulus values of 173 ± 15 GPa , 81.9 ± 12.7 GPa , and 24.6 ± 16 GPa , respectively. The pre-tension values of these nanosheets were estimated to be 0.34 ± 0.12 N m-1 , 0.14 ± 0.04 N m-1 , and 0.15 ± 0.03 N m-1 for GaS , GaSe<disease> , and GaTe , respectively. GaS nanosheets exhibited the highest Young 's modulus ( 173 GPa) among these nanosheets , which is comparable to that of WS2 and WSe2. A failure characteristic study over these group-III monochalcogenides revealed that these materials can withstand stresses of up to 8 GPa and a maximal strain of 7 % before breaking. Altogether , our findings indicate that GaS , GaSe<disease> , and GaTe are attractive candidates for use in stretchable electronic applications and in future optomechanical devices.
