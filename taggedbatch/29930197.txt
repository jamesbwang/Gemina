 Diagnoses extracted from physician notes are used to calculate hospital quality metrics; failure to document high-risk diagnoses may lead to the appearance of worse-than-expected outcomes for complex patients. Academic hospitals often rely on documentation authored by trainees , yet residents receive little training in this regard. In this study , we evaluate inpatient pediatric resident notes to determine which high-risk diagnoses are commonly missed and assess the efficacy of a multitiered intervention to improve the documentation of these diagnoses. In a baseline review of 220 charts , 13 frequently missed high-risk diagnoses were identified in 2013. Interventions began in 2014 , including physician education and reference cards. The intervention also included note template prompts for 4 of the diagnoses. Using a standardized rubric , we reviewed charts for 3 years ( 2013 , 2014 , and 2015). The average within-disease probability of missed high-risk diagnoses was compared across time. There was a decrease in the probability of undocumented target high-risk diagnoses after the intervention ( 52 % vs 36 % in 2014 ( odds ratio = 0.51; Pediatric residents were significantly less likely to omit a high-risk diagnosis in their notes after implementation of our documentation improvement program , suggesting that curriculum development is an effective method of improving documentation , with the goal of improving the accuracy of health systems performance indices.
