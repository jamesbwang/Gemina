 To assess the profilometric changes of the buccal soft<disease> tissues between baseline and 5 years of loading using a one- and two-piece dental implant system. Sixty patients randomly received dental implants of either a two-piece type ( BRA) or a one-piece type ( STM). Casts were obtained at baseline ( after crown insertion) , at the 1-year and at the 5-year follow-up. Stereolithography files were obtained from the casts for digital superimposition. One implant and the contralateral natural tooth were selected for the analysis. Thirty-three patients ( BRA = 16; STM = 17) were included. Measurements included changes for crown height ( CH) and estimated soft<disease> tissue thickness , as well as the profilometric change at the implant and the tooth site. Nonparametric methods were applied for the statistical analyses and medians and quartiles presented. The BRA group lost -0.39 mm and the STM group lost -0.40 mm of volume between baseline and the 5-year follow-up at the implant site ( p > 0.05). The tooth site lost -0.18 mm ( BRA) and -0.12 mm ( STM) ( p > 0.05). Volume differences between implants and teeth amounted to -0.05 mm ( baseline to 1 year) and -0.25 mm ( baseline to 5 years) for BRA , while for STM , the values were 0.03 mm ( baseline to 1 year) and -0.16 mm ( baseline to 5 years). The changes for implant CH at 1 and 5 years of follow-up amounted 0.10 and 0.09 mm ( BRA) and to 0.03 and 0.22 mm ( STM). The changes in tissue thickness at 1 and 5 years in the BRA group amounted to -0.28 and -0.66 mm at 1 mm , -0.21 and -0.46 mm at 3 mm , and -0.32 and -0.45 mm at 5 mm , respectively. The changes in the STM group amounted to -0.15 and -0.54 mm at 1 mm , -0.24 and -0.48 mm at 3 mm , and -0.32 and -0.57 mm at 5 mm , respectively. No significantly different medians were observed. Minimal profilometric and linear changes occurred at implant sites between baseline and 5 years , between implant and tooth sites and between the two implant systems.
