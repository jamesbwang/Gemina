 A honeycomb-patterned porous film was conveniently prepared by means of the microemulsion method and then used as an effective coating for improving the dielectric properties and water resistance of polyimide ( PI) film while maintaining its mechanical properties. The dielectric properties could be regulated by tuning the structure of the porous film through controlling its formation conditions. When suitable conditions were used , the prepared composite PI film exhibited a significant reduction of 28.3 % in its dielectric constant and 9.48-54.99 % in dielectric loss accompanied by an extremely low water uptake of 0.62 % relative to the 2.47 % of flat PI film. The composite PI film also displayed excellent durability under moist conditions , as the dielectric constant was still below 2.4 after exposure to 75 % relative humidity for more than 12 h. This provides a novel method to improve and control the dielectric properties of materials. It also suggests that this film is a suitable candidate for coating dielectric materials in high-humidity environments.
