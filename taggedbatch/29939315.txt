 Chronic kidney disease ( CKD) is characterized by adverse changes in body composition , which are associated with poor clinical outcome and physical functioning. Whilst size is the key for muscle functioning , changes in muscle quality specifically increase in intramuscular fat infiltration ( myosteatosis) and fibrosis<disease> ( myofibrosis) may be important. We investigated the role of muscle quality and size on physical performance in non-dialysis CKD patients. Ultrasound ( US) images of the rectus<pathogen> femoris ( RF) were obtained. Muscle quality was assessed using echo intensity ( EI) , and qualitatively using Heckmatt 's visual rating scale. Muscle size was obtained from RF cross-sectional area ( RF-CSA). Physical function was measured by the sit-to-stand-60s ( STS-60) test , incremental ( ISWT) and endurance shuttle walk tests , lower limb and handgrip strength , exercise capacity ( VO2peak) and gait speed. A total of 61 patients ( 58.5 ± 14.9 years , 46 % female , estimated glomerular filtration rate 31.1 ± 20.2 mL/min/1 .73 m2) were recruited. Lower EI ( i.e. higher muscle quality) was significantly associated with better physical performance ( STS-60 ( r = 0.363) and ISWT ( r = 0.320)) , and greater VO2peak ( r = 0.439). The qualitative rating was closely associated with EI values , and significant differences in function were seen between the ratings. RF-CSA was a better predictor of performance than muscle quality. In CKD , increased US-derived EI was negatively correlated with physical performance; however , muscle size remains the largest predictor of physical function. Therefore , in addition to the loss of muscle size , muscle quality should be considered an important factor that may contribute to deficits in mobility and function in CKD. Interventions such as exercise could improve both of these factors.
