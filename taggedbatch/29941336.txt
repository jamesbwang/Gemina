 We aimed to assess broad-spectrum beta-lactam prescriptions ( except carbapenems) in a French teaching hospital and the impact of controlled dispensing , antimicrobial management team , and antibiotic treatment reassessment on Day 2-3. We performed a point-prevalence study in all hospital units and analyzed curative antibiotic broad-spectrum beta-lactam prescriptions. The assessment focused on indication , dosing , combinations , revaluation on Day 2-3 , and treatment duration. Sixty-seven broad-spectrum beta-lactam prescriptions were identified. The main prescriptions were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid ( 37 % , n = 25) , ceftriaxone ( 36 % , n = 24) , and piperacillin-tazobactam ( 16 % , n = 11). Indications , doses , combinations , and reassessment on Day 2-3 were appropriate , respectively 90 % ( n = 60) , 96 % ( n = 64) , 94 % ( 33/35 combinations) , and 88 % ( n = 59). However , appropriate treatment durations amounted to only 63 % ( n = 42). The benefit of controlled dispensing was observed in terms of overall antibiotic treatment duration: 86 % versus 51 % adequacy for uncontrolled dispensing of beta-lactams ( P = 0.02). The antimicrobial management team improved the antibiotic treatment duration: 73 % of appropriate durations versus 44 % for beta-lactams not monitored by the team , but this difference was not significant. Broad-spectrum beta-lactams were usually well prescribed but the adequacy of treatment duration could be improved , especially by reinforcing the monitoring of prescriptions.
