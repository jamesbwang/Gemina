 To develop a 3D neural cell construct for encapsulated delivery of transplant cells; develop hydrogels seeded with magnetic nanoparticle ( MNP)- labeled cells suitable for cell tracking by MRI. Astrocytes were exogenously labeled with MRI-compatible iron-oxide MNPs prior to intra-construct incorporation within a 3D collagen hydrogel. A connective , complex cellular network was clearly observable within the 3D constructs , with high cellular viability. MNP accumulation in astrocytes provided a hypointense MRI signal at 24 h & 14 days. Our findings support the concept of developing a 3D construct possessing the dual advantages of ( i) support of long-term cell survival of neural populations with ( ii) the potential for noninvasive MRI-tracking of intra-construct cells for neuroregenerative applications.
