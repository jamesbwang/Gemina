 Mutations create novel genetic variants , but their contribution to variation in fitness and other phenotypes may depend on environmental conditions. Furthermore , natural environments may be highly heterogeneous. We assessed phenotypes associated with survival and reproductive success in over 30,000 plants representing 100 mutation accumulation lines of
