 Concurrent selenium and iodine deficiencies are widespread , in both developing and developed countries. Salt iodisation is insufficient to ensure global iodine adequacy , with an estimated one-third of humanity at risk of hypothyroidism and associated iodine deficiency disorders ( IDD). Agronomic biofortification of food crops , especially staples such as cereals , which are consumed widely , may be an effective component of a food system strategy to reduce selenium and iodine malnutrition. Iodine and selenium are needed in the optimum intake range for thyroid health , hence joint biofortification makes sense for areas deficient in both. Foliar application is recommended as the most effective , efficient , least wasteful method for selenium and iodine biofortification. Currently , selenium is easier to increase in grain , fruit , and storage roots by this method , being more phloem mobile than iodine. Nevertheless , strategic timing ( around heading is usually best) , use of surfactants and co-application with potassium nitrate can increase the effectiveness of foliar iodine biofortification. More research is needed on iodine transporters and iodine volatilisation in plants , bioavailability of iodine in biofortified plant products , and roles for nano selenium and iodine in biofortification. For adoption , farmers need an incentive such as access to a premium functional food market , a subsidy or increased grain yield resulting from possible synergies with co-applied fertilisers , enhancers , fungicides , and insecticides. Further research is needed to inform these aspects of foliar agronomic biofortification.
