 Successful mapping and ablation of arrhythmias can be a challenging clinical task. For many years , conventional pacing maneuvers and activation mapping were the gold standard to identify underlying arrhythmia mechanisms in ablation procedures. In the last decade , technology has dramatically improved. In parallel to high-density automated mapping , cardiac imaging and image integration tools are increasingly used to assess the arrhythmia substrate and identify reentrant circuits. The aim of this review is to describe the technologies underlying these new mapping systems and to discuss their possible role in providing new insights into identification and visualization of arrhythmia mechanisms.
