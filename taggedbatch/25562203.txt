 Self-tracking technologies have created high hopes , even hype , for aiding people to govern their own health risks and promote optimal wellness. High expectations do not , however , necessarily materialize due to connective gaps between personal experiences and self-tracking data. This study examines situations when self-trackers face difficulties in engaging with , and reflecting on , their data with the aim of identifying the specificities and consequences of such connective gaps in self-tracking contexts. The study is based on empirical analyses of interviews of inexperienced , experienced and extreme self-trackers ( in total 27) , who participated in a pilot study aiming at promoting health and wellness. The study shows that people using self-tracking devices actively search for constant connectivity to their everyday experiences and particularly health and wellness through personal data but often become disappointed. The results suggest that in connective gaps the personal data remains invisible or inaccurate , generating feelings of confusion<symptom> and doubt in the users of the self-tracking devices. These are alarming symptoms that may lead to indifference when disconnectivity becomes solidified and data ends up becoming dead , providing nothing useful for the users of self-tracking technologies. High expectations which are put on wearables to advance health and wellness may remain unmaterialised due to connective gaps. This is problematic if individuals are increasingly expected to be active in personal data collection and interpretation regarding their own health and wellness.
