 Several species of the genus Penicillium<pathogen> were isolated during a survey of the mycobiota of Apulian cave cheeses ripened in a cave in Gravina di Puglia , Italy. A novel species , Penicillium<pathogen> gravinicasei , is described in Penicillium section Cinnamopurpurea. Its taxonomic novelty was determined using a polyphasic approach , combining phenotypic , molecular ( Î²-tubulin , calmodulin , ITS and DNA dependent RNA polymerase) DNA sequences and mycotoxin production data. Phylogenetic analyses of the RPB2 data showed that isolates of the novel species form a clade most closely related to Penicillium<pathogen> cinnamopurpureum and P. parvulum<pathogen> with high bootstrap support. The fungus did not produce ochratoxin A , citrinin , patulin , sterigmatocystin or aflatoxin B
