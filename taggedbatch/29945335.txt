 To study the urinalysis request , pre-analytical sample conditions , and analytical procedures. Laboratories were asked to provide the number of primary care urinalyses requested , and to fill out a questionnaire regarding pre-analytical conditions and analytical procedures. 110 laboratories participated in the study. 232.5 urinalyses/1 ,000 inhabitants were reported. 75.4 % used the first morning urine. The sample reached the laboratory in less than 2 hours in 18.8 % , between 2- 4 hours in 78.3 % , and between 4- 6 hours in the remaining 2.9 %. 92.5 % combined the use of test strip and particle analysis , and only 7.5 % used the strip exclusively. All participants except one performed automated particle analysis depending on strip results; in 16.2 % the procedure was only manual. Urinalysis was highly requested. There was a lack of compliance with guidelines regarding time between micturition and analysis that usually involved the combination of strip followed by particle analysis.
