 Despite the recent outbreak of Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) , there are still no approved treatments , and early-stage compounds are probably many years away from approval. A comprehensive A-Z review of the recent advances in ZIKV drug discovery efforts is presented , highlighting drug repositioning and computationally guided compounds , including discovered viral and host cell inhibitors. Promising ZIKV molecular targets are also described and discussed , as well as targets belonging to the host cell , as new opportunities for ZIKV drug discovery. All this knowledge is not only crucial to advancing the fight against the Zika<pathogen><disease><pathogen> virus<pathogen> and other flaviviruses but also helps us prepare for the next emerging virus outbreak to which we will have to respond.
