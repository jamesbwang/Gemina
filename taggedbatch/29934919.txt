 Quantification of hepatic fat and iron content is important for early detection and monitoring of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) patients. This study evaluated quantification efficiency of hepatic proton density fat fraction ( PDFF) by MRI using NAFLD rabbits. R2 * was also measured to investigate whether it correlates with fat levels in NAFLD. NAFLD rabbit model was successfully established by high fat and cholesterol diet. Rabbits underwent MRI examination for fat and iron analyses , compared with liver histological findings. MR examinations were performed on a 3.0 T MR system using multi-echo 3D gradient recalled echo ( GRE) sequence. MRI-PDFF showed significant differences between different steatosis grades with medians of 3.72 % ( normal) , 5.43 % ( mild) , 9.11 % ( moderate) and 11.17 % ( severe) , whereas this was not observed in R2 *. Close correlation between MRI-PDFF and histological steatosis was observed ( r = 0.78 , P = 0.000). Hepatic iron deposit was not found in any rabbits. There was no correlation between R2 * and either liver MRI-PDFF or histological steatosis. MR measuring MRI-PDFF and R2 * simultaneously provides promising quantification of steatosis and iron. Rabbit NAFLD model confirmed accuracy of MRI-PDFF for liver fat quantification. R2 * measurement and relationship between fat and iron of NAFLD liver need further experimental investigation.
