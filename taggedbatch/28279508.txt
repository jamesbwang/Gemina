 Introduction Latent tuberculosis<disease> infection ( LTBI) screening with targeted treatment has been successful in eradicating tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) as an endemic infection in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) recommends screening for high-risk patients. The aim of this study was to increase LTBI screening , detection , and treatment in our student-run free clinic while providing an innovative platform for education in primary care topics. Methods A questionnaire for screening for LTBI was adapted from CDC guidelines. Medical students and providers received education on the screening process and administered questionnaires to patients. We analyzed the rate of performed LTBI screening , the rate of diagnostic testing for patients with positive screening , and the feasibility of implementing a preventive screening initiative. Results Fifty-two patients completed primary care visits. Forty patients were screened for LTBI. Of those screened , 42.5 % were positive for the screening. Of those with positive screening , 70.6 % were followed up via diagnostic testing , with the rest of them being lost for follow-up due to not attending the clinic for care. Conclusions This educational intervention combined with a screening tool was effective in increasing LTBI screening rates amongst patients in a student-run free clinic.
