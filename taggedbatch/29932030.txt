 Migraine is a common disabling neurological disorder which is characterised by recurring headache<symptom> associated with a variety of sensory and autonomic symptoms. The pathophysiology of migraine remains not entirely understood , although many mechanisms involving the central and peripheral nervous system are now becoming clear. In particular , it is widely accepted that migraine is associated with energy metabolic impairment of the brain. The purpose of this review is to present an update overview of the energy metabolism involvement in the migraine pathophysiology. Several biochemical , morphological and magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have confirmed the presence of energy production deficiency together with an increment of energy consumption in migraine patients. An increment of energy demand over a certain threshold create metabolic and biochemical preconditions for the onset of the migraine attack. The defect of oxidative energy metabolism in migraine is generalized. It remains to be determined if the mitochondrial deficit in migraine is primary or secondary. Riboflavin and Co-Enzyme Q10 , both physiologically implicated in mitochondrial respiratory chain functioning , are effective in migraine prophylaxis , supporting the hypothesis that improving brain energy metabolism may reduce the susceptibility to migraine.
