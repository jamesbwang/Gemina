 Data about correlation of interleukins ( IL-1 α , IL-1 β , IFN γ , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10) , adipocytokines ( leptin , adiponectin , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1) , resistin , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1) , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor alpha ( TNFα) , ferritin , C reactive protein ( CRP) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) with homeostasis model assessment ( HOMA) in HIV/AIDS patients are still limited. Therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible correlations of serum levels of PAI-1 , leptin and ferritin with HOMA in HIV/AIDS patients treated with combined antiretroviral therapy ( cART). This cross-sectional study included 64 HIV/AIDS patients , all Caucasians , receiving cART at the HIV/AIDS Centre , Belgrade , Serbia. PAI-1 , leptin , ferritin and insulin levels were measured using the Metabolic Syndrome<disease><symptom> Array I ( Randox Laboratories Ltd. , London , UK) , while adiponectin and resistin levels were measured using Metabolic Syndrome<disease><symptom> Array II ( Randox Laboratories Ltd. , London , UK) , interleukins ( IL-1 α , IL-1 β , IFN γ , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10) , MCP-1 , TNF-α as well as VEGF was measured using Cytokine Array I ( Randox Laboratories Ltd. , London , UK). Insulin resistance was determined using the homeostasis model assessment index ( HOMA). Multicollinearity of independent variables in multivariate model was analyzed using Variance Inflation Factor. Correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between HOMA and waist circumference , body mass index , patients ' age , number of cART combinations and triglycerides ( p = 0.001 , p = 0.001 , p = 0.050 , p = 0.044 , p = 0.002 , respectively). HOMA negatively correlated with levels of high density lipoprotein ( HDL) ( Rho = -0.282; p = 0.025). PAI-1 ( Rho = 0.334; p = 0.007) and leptin ( Rho = 0.492; p = 0.001) together with ferritin ( Rho = 0.396 , p = 0.001) positively and significantly correlated with HOMA. Levels of IL-1 α , IL-1 β , IFN γ , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , adiponectin , MCP-1 , resistin , TNF-α , CRP and VEGF did not significantly correlate with HOMA. Further , multiple logistic regression showed that there is a statistically significant correlation between PAI , leptin and ferritin with HOMA levels ( p = 0.042; p < 0.001 , p = 0.009). We showed significant correlation between PAI-1 , leptin and ferritin , independently of each other with HOMA , in HIV/AIDS patients on cART.
