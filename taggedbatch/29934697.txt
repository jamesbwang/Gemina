 We present the Chinese Lexical Database ( CLD): a large-scale lexical database for simplified Chinese. The CLD provides a wealth of lexical information for 3913 one-character words , 34,233 two-character words , 7143 three-character words , and 3355 four-character words , and is publicly available through http://www.chineselexicaldatabase.com. For each of the 48,644 words in the CLD , we provide a wide range of categorical predictors , as well as an extensive set of frequency measures , complexity measures , neighborhood density measures , orthography-phonology consistency measures , and information-theoretic measures. We evaluate the explanatory power of the lexical variables in the CLD in the context of experimental data through analyses of lexical decision latencies for one-character , two-character , three-character and four-character words , as well as word naming latencies for one-character and two-character words. The results of these analyses are discussed.
