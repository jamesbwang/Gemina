 As hypoxia is an important factor to limit chemotherapeutic efficacy in tumors , we herein report three ruthenium ( II)- arene complexes containing a hypoxia inducible factor-1α inhibitor ( YC-1) , which endow the organometallic complexes with potential for hypoxia targeting. In vitro tests showed the resulting complexes had higher anticancer activities in hypoxia than in normoxia against the tested cancer cell lines. Western blot analysis revealed that complexes 1-3 blocked HIF-1α protein accumulation under hypoxic conditions. Moreover , these complexes displayed much less cytotoxicity toward the normal human umbilical vein endothelial cell line ( HUVEC) , indicating that complexes 1-3 may be selectively cytotoxic for human cancer cell lines. These findings proved that ligation with YC-1 endowed these organometallic ruthenium ( II) complexes with potential for hypoxia targeting in addition to enhancing their anticancer activities.
