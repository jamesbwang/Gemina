 Striae gravidarum is a common skin problem of considerable cosmetic concern for many pregnant women. Various risk factors associated with the development of striae have been reported , with conflicting results. To analyze the risk factors of striae gravidarum in Chinese primiparous women and to provide evidence relevant to the prevention of this condition. Singleton primiparous pregnant women who were hospitalized for delivery were included , and relevant data were collected. Independent risk factors associated with striae gravidarum in women with and those without striae gravidarum were identified using logistic regression. Among 213 singleton primiparous pregnant women , 125 had striae gravidarum , yielding a prevalence of up to 58.9 %. There was a significant variation ( P < 0.05 , odds ratio > 1) between the striae gravidarum and non-striae gravidarum groups in terms of several factors , including younger maternal age , weight gain during pregnancy , body mass index gain , uterine height , abdominal girth , and positive family history. Factors such as maternal height , birth weight , systemic<disease> disease<disease> , skin type , and neonatal gender did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. This study showed that the independent risk factors for striae gravidarum in primiparous women were younger maternal age , weight gain during pregnancy , body mass index gain , uterine height , abdominal girth , and a positive family history. The severity of striae gravidarum was associated with weight gain during pregnancy , body mass index gain , abdominal girth , and timing of the onset of striae gravidarum.
