 Opto-mechanical oscillators that generate coherent acoustic waves are drawing much interest , in both fundamental research and applications. Narrowband oscillations can be obtained through the introduction of feedback to the acoustic wave. Most previous realizations of this concept , sometimes referred to as `` phonon lasers '' , relied on radiation pressure and moving boundary effects in micro- or nano-structured media. Demonstrations in bulk crystals required cryogenic temperatures. In this work , stimulated emission of highly-coherent acoustic waves is achieved in a commercially-available multi-core fiber , at room temperature. The fiber is connected within an opto-electronic cavity loop. Pump light in one core is driving acoustic waves via electrostriction , whereas an optical probe wave at a different physical core undergoes photo-elastic modulation by the stimulated acoustic waves. Coupling between pump and probe is based entirely on inter-core , opto-mechanical cross-phase modulation: no direct optical feedback is provided. Single-frequency mechanical oscillations at hundreds of MHz frequencies are obtained , with side-mode suppression that is better than 55 dB. A sharp threshold and rapid collapse of the linewidth above threshold are observed. The linewidths of the acoustic oscillations are on the order of 100 Hz , orders of magnitude narrower than those of the pump and probe light sources. The relative Allan 's deviation of the frequency is between 0.1-1 ppm. The frequency may be switched among several values by propagating the pump or probe waves in different cores. The results may be used in sensing , metrology and microwave-photonic information processing applications.
