 Sports practice during childhood can influence health indicators in later ages through direct and indirect pathways. Thus , this study aimed to test direct and indirect pathways to the association between sports practice in childhood and metabolic risk in adolescence , adopting physical activity , adiposity , and cardiorespiratory fitness at adolescence as potential mediators. This cross-sectional study with retrospective information was conducted with 991 adolescents ( 579 girls , 412 boys) aged 10 to 16 y. Sports activity was self-reported in childhood ( retrospective data) and physical activity evaluated in adolescence through questionnaires. Somatic maturation ( Mirwald method) , cardiorespiratory fitness ( 20-m shuttle-run test) , body fat ( skinfolds) , waist circumference , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( automatic instrument) and blood variables ( fasting glucose , HDL cholesterol , and triglycerides) were measured at adolescence. Waist circumference , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and blood variables composed the metabolic risk score. Structured equation modeling was adopted. In both sexes , the relationship between sports practice at childhood and metabolic risk was fully mediated by habitual physical activity , which is related to the obesity construct and cardiorespiratory fitness. Obesity was associated with metabolic risk in boys ( β = 0.062; p < 0.001) and girls ( β = 0.047; p < 0.001). The relationship between sports practice in childhood and metabolic risk in adolescence was mediated by physical activity , obesity , and cardiorespiratory fitness.
