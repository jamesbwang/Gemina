 Greater saphenous vein ( GSV) thrombosis is concerning due to its close proximity to the deep femoral vein. This study sought to identify the risk of propagation to deep vein thrombosis ( DVT) or pulmonary embolism ( PE) among patients with isolated proximal GSV superficial thrombosis and describe provider practice patterns related to treatment. This is an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective multi-center study. Patients presented to one of three possible emergency departments in a large health system. About 21,716 patients were queried through the electronic medical record. Ninety-five patients or 0.4 % of study subjects met inclusion criteria of isolated proximal GSV thrombosis. Forty-five patients were excluded , leaving a final data set of 40 patients. Investigators recorded radiology impressions , patient demographics , past medical history , DVT/PE risk factors , and treatment plans. Propagation of GSV thrombosis to DVT/PE was also noted. Follow-up methods included chart review , primary care physician follow-up , and direct , scripted patient follow-up phone calls. Descriptive statistics were applied to study subjects using SAS for Windows , version 9.3. Three patients ( 7.5 %) had progression of GSV thrombosis to DVT/PE. Twenty percent of patients without malignancy were treated with anticoagulation compared to 14 % of those with preexisting malignancy upon initial diagnosis of isolated GSV thrombosis. Forty-five percent of patients were prescribed some type of supportive therapy to aid in the treatment of GSV thrombosis. Isolated proximal GSV thrombosis , while uncommon , may frequently progress to DVT or PE. Our work suggests clinicians should consider anticoagulation for isolated GSV thrombosis.
