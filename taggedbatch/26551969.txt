 After myocardial infarction ( MI) , the scar tissue contributes to ventricular dysfunction by electrically uncoupling viable cardiomyocytes in the infarct region. Injection of a conductive hydrogel could not only provide mechanical support to the infarcted region , but also synchronize contraction and restore ventricular function by electrically connecting isolated cardiomyocytes to intact tissue.
