 This paper demonstrates the use of phosphinecarboxamide as a facile phosphorus precursor , which can be used alongside zinc acetate for the chemical vapour deposition ( CVD) of adherent and crystalline zinc phosphide films. Thin films of Zn3P2 have a number of potential applications and phosphinecarboxamide is a safer and more efficient precursor than the highly toxic , corrosive and flammable phosphine used in previous CVD syntheses.
