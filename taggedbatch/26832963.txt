 To describe the design and initial implementation of an Intensive Care Unit Recovery Center ( ICU-RC) in the United States. A prospective , observational feasibility study was undertaken at an academic hospital between July 2012 and December 2015. Clinical criteria were used to develop the ICU-RC , identify patients at high risk for post intensive care syndrome<disease><symptom> ( PICS) , and offer them post-ICU care. 218/307 referred patients ( 71 %) survived to hospital discharge; 62 ( 28 % of survivors) were seen in clinic. Median time from discharge to ICU-RC visit was 29days. At initial evaluation , 64 % of patients had clinically meaningful cognitive impairment. Anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> were present in 37 % and 27 % of patients , respectively. One in three patients was unable to ambulate independently; median 6 min walk distance was 56 % predicted. Of 47 previously working patients , 7 ( 15 %) had returned to work. Case management and referral services were provided 142 times. The median number of interventions per patient was 4. An ICU-RC identified a high prevalence of cognitive impairment , anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> , physical debility , lifestyle changes , and medication-related problems warranting intervention. Whether an ICU-RC can improve ICU recovery in the US should be investigated in a systematic way.
