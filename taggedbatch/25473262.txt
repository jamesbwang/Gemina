 Retinopathy in the context of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) is associated with severe disease and poorer prognosis. We studied retinopathy in our cohort of Indian lupus patients. Four hundred and thirty-seven patients fulfilling the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics-American College of Rheumatology-2012 criteria , attending the department of Clinical Immunology were enrolled under this cross-sectional study. A comprehensive clinical ( including ophthalmological) examination and immunological profile were performed. Retinopathy was defined if cotton-wool spots , haemorrhages , vasculitis , retinal detachment or optic disc changes as papilledema , optic atrophy were present. Disease activity was assessed using SLE disease activity index ( SLEDAI). Mean age of participants was 28.06 Â± 9.7 years ( 93.1 % females); median disease duration 12 months ( Interquartile range-IQR 6.36). Forty-five ( 10.3 %) had SLE associated retinopathy. Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia ( 31.1 vs 14.5 % , p value 0.004 , odd 's ratio-OR ( 95 % confidence interval-CI) 2.65 ( 1.33-5.29)) , serositis ( 33.3 vs 18.9 % , p value 0.023 , OR ( CI) 2.14 ( 1.11-4.10)) , lupus nephritis ( 62.2 vs 40.8 % , p value 0.006 , OR ( CI) 2.38 ( 1.26-4.50)) , seizures<symptom> ( 28.9 vs 12.8 % , p value 0.004 , OR ( CI) 2.77 ( 1.36-5.65)) and median SLEDAI score ( 24 vs 12 , p < 0.01) were significantly higher in those with retinopathy. On adjusted binary logistic regression , autoimmune hemolytic<symptom> anemia<symptom> , lupus nephritis and presence of antibodies to Smith antigen were predictors for retinopathy. Retinopathy is common in SLE , a marker of active disease with frequent renal<symptom> involvement<symptom> and should be screened for in all patients with lupus.
