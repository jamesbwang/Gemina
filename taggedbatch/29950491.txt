 Loss of function of the DIS3L2 exoribonuclease is associated with Wilms tumor and the Perlman congenital overgrowth syndrome<disease><symptom>. LIN28 , a Wilms tumor oncoprotein , triggers the DIS3L2-mediated degradation of the precursor of let-7 , a microRNA that inhibits Wilms tumor development. These observations have led to speculation that DIS3L2-mediated tumor suppression is attributable to let-7 regulation. Here we examine new DIS3L2-deficient cell lines and mouse models , demonstrating that DIS3L2 loss has no effect on mature let-7 levels. Rather , analysis of
