 Studies have suggested that musculoskeletal symptoms increase after natural disasters. The Great<pathogen> East Japan Earthquake ( GEJE) and accompanying tsunami placed a huge financial burden on the local population. This study determined whether subjective economic hardship influenced the new onset of neck<symptom> pain<symptom> ( katakori) in the chronic phase after the GEJE. This study used longitudinal data from 1359 adults who had responded to the self-report questionnaire at 2 and 3 years after the GEJE. New-onset neck<symptom> pain<symptom> was defined as neck<symptom> pain<symptom> absent at 2 years and present at 3 years. Subjective economic hardship at 2 years after the GEJE was categorized into 4 groups: `` normal , '' `` a little bit hard , '' `` hard , '' and `` very hard. '' Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio ( OR) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI) in order to examine the association between subjective economic hardship and new-onset neck<symptom> pain<symptom>. Among the participants , 12.9 % ( n = 175) reported new-onset neck<symptom> pain<symptom>. A significantly higher rate of new-onset neck<symptom> pain<symptom> was observed in participants who considered their subjective economic hardship to be `` hard '' ( OR = 2.10 , 95 % CI = 1.34-3.30) or `` very hard '' ( OR = 3.26 , 95 % CI = 1.83-5.46; p for trend < 0.001) compared with those who considered their hardship to be `` normal. '' Subjective economic hardship was significantly associated with new-onset neck<symptom> pain<symptom> in the chronic phase of the GEJE. ( 228/300).
