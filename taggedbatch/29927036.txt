 Owing to their unique , nanoscale related optical properties , nanostructures assembled from molecular photosensitizers ( PSs) have interesting applications in phototheranostics. However , most nanostructured PS assemblies are super-quenched , thus , preventing their use in photodynamic therapy ( PDT). Although some of these materials undergo stimuli-responsive disassembly , which leads to partial recovery of PDT activity , their therapeutic potentials are unsatisfactory owing to a limited ability to promote generation reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , especially via type I photoreactions ( i.e. , not by
