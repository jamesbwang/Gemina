 Many patients are diagnosed with hypertension each year , making rapid and effective control of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) crucial. Appropriate first-line treatment is important , and special attention should be paid to the positive effects of lowering BP early. Perindopril 3.5 mg/amlodipine 2.5 mg ( P3 .5/ A2 .5) is a single-pill combination suitable for first-line use. The doses of each component of the single-pill combination were selected for a first-line setting. To investigate the effectiveness of the P3 .5/ A2 .5 combination at lowering BP compared with renin-angiotensin system ( RAS)- inhibitor monotherapies , after 1 month of treatment. Individual patient data from three randomized controlled trials were used to evaluate the efficacy of P3 .5/ A2 .5 versus RAS-inhibitor monotherapies after 1 month in 5496 patients with hypertension , in a combined analysis. P3 .5/ A2 .5 was well tolerated and significantly more effective at reducing BP after 1 month than RAS-inhibitor monotherapies ( perindopril 5 mg , irbesartan 150 mg or valsartan 80 mg). P3 .5/ A2 .5 was associated with a significantly lower SBP ( P = 0.002) and DBP ( P = 0.005) after 1 month of treatment compared with RAS-inhibitor monotherapies. In a large patient population , early administration of P3 .5/ A2 .5 resulted in a significantly greater BP-lowering effect than perindopril , irbesartan or valsartan monotherapies after 1 month. Reducing BP levels within a month of treatment may reasonably be expected to lead to a reduced risk of cardiovascular events.
