 Protein carbonylation is a posttranslational modification referring to the occurrence of aldehydes and ketones in proteins. The current understanding of how carbonylation , in particular , metal-catalyzed carbonylation , occurs in recombinant mAbs during production and storage is very limited. To facilitate investigations into mAb carbonylation , we developed a protein carbonylation assay with improved assay robustness and precision over the conventional assays. We applied this assay to investigate mAb carbonylation under production , storage , and stress conditions and showed that iron , hydrogen peroxide , and polysorbate 20 at pharmaceutically relevant levels critically influence the extent of mAb carbonylation. In addition , we found that while carbonylation correlates with mAb aggregation in several cases , carbonylation can not be used as a general indicator for aggregation. Furthermore , we observed that mAb carbonylation level can decrease during storage , which indicates that carbonylation products may not be stable. Finally , we report for the first time a positive correlation between carbonylation and acidic charge heterogeneity of mAbs that underwent metal-catalyzed oxidation. This finding shows that the impact of protein carbonylation on product quality for mAbs is not limited to aggregation but also extends to charge heterogeneity.
