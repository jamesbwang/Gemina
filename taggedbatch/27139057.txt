 The purpose was to retrospectively evaluate the effect of intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT) on gastrointestinal ( GI) toxicities and outcomes compared to three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy ( 3DCRT) for locally advanced pancreatic cancer ( LAPC). We included 107 consecutive patients who underwent CRT for LAPC from September 2001 to March 2015; 80 patients underwent 3DCRT and 27 patients underwent IMRT. They were compared for GI toxicities , locoregional progression free survival ( LRPFS) , distant metastasis free survival ( DMS) , and overall survival ( OS). Median radiation dose and fractions for 3DCRT and IMRT were 54 Gy/30 fr. and 48 Gy/15 fr. The regimens of CRT consisted of weekly gemcitabine 250 mg/m LAPC patients treated with hypofractionated full-dose gemcitabine IMRT had improved OS and LRPFS without increased GI toxicities when compared to those of patients treated with conventionally fractionated low dose gemcitabine 3DCRT. In IMRT patients , higher dose was an independent favorable prognostic factor for better LRPFS and OS , which suggests that dose escalation with IMRT for LAPC is a promising strategy.
