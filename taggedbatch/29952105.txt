 Graphene has been employed as an excellent support for metal nanomaterials because of its unique structural and physicochemical properties. Silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs) with exceptional properties have received considerable attention in various fields; however , particle aggregation limits its application. Therefore , the combination of AgNPs and graphene based nanocomposites ( Ag-graphene based nanocomposites) has been widely explored to improve their properties and applications. Excitingly , enhanced antimicrobial , catalytic , and surface enhanced Raman scattering properties are obtained after their combination. In order to have a comprehensive knowledge of these nanocomposites , this Review highlights the chemical and biological synthesis of Ag-graphene nanocomposites. In particular , their applications as antimicrobial agents , catalysts , and sensors in biomedicine , agricultural protection , and environmental remediation and detection are covered. Meanwhile , the factors that influence the synthesis and applications are also briefly discussed. Furthermore , several important issues on the challenges and new directions are also provided for further development of these nanocomposites.
