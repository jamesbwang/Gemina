 The ten-eleven translocation ( TET) proteins play a crucial role in promoting locus-specific reversal of DNA methylation , a type of chromatin modification. Considerable evidences have demonstrated that the sequence motifs with specific codes are important to determine the functions of domains and active sites. Here , we surveyed major studies and reviews regarding the multiple functions of the TET proteins and established the patterns of the motif arrangements that determine the functions of TET proteins. First , we summarized the functional sequence basis of TET proteins and identified the new functional motifs based on the phylogenetic relationship. Next , we described the sequence characteristics of the functional motifs in detail and provided an overview of the relationship between the sequence motifs and the functions of TET proteins , including known functions and potential functions. Finally , we highlighted that sequence motifs with diverse post-translational modifications perform unique functions , and different selection pressures lead to different arrangements of sequence motifs , resulting in different paralogs and isoforms.
