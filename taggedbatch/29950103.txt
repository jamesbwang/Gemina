 Background and aims Based on the foundations of Bandura 's social cognitive theory and theory of triadic influence ( TTI) theoretical framework , this study was designed to examine the mediating role of positive outcome expectancy of Internet use in the relationship between social influence and Internet addiction ( IA) in a large representative sample of senior high-school students in Taiwan. Methods Using a cross-sectional design , 1,922 participants were recruited from senior high schools throughout Taiwan using both stratified and cluster sampling , and a comprehensive survey was administered. Results Structural equation modeling and bootstrap analyses results showed that IA severity was significantly and positively predicted by social influence , and fully mediated through positive outcome expectancy of Internet use. Discussion and conclusions The results not only support Bandura 's social cognitive theory and TTI framework , but can also serve as a reference to help educational agencies and mental health organizations design programs and create policies that will help in the prevention of IA among adolescents.
