 Insomnia and depressive symptoms are commonly reported by adults and have independently been found to be associated with mortality , though contrasting findings are reported. Given the high comorbidity and interrelatedness between these symptoms , we tested whether insomnia symptoms explain risk of death independent of depressive symptoms. We examined insomnia symptoms and depressive symptoms , in addition to other health and demographic covariates , as predictors of all-cause mortality. The sample included 15 418 adults aged 51 and older drawn from a nationally representative , population-based study of adults in the United States , the Health and Retirement Study. Cox survival models were used to analyze time to death between the 2002 and 2014 study waves ( 5 waves). Controlling for health and demographic covariates , in 3 separate models , depressive symptoms and insomnia symptoms were independently and then together considered as risk factors for all-cause mortality ( drawn from the National Death Index). After adjustment for covariates , insomnia symptoms ( HR = 1.10 , CI: 1.07-1.13) and depressive symptoms ( HR = 1.14 , CI: 1.12-1.16) each were associated with a greater hazard of death. When considered together , however , depressive symptoms fully accounted for the association between insomnia symptoms and mortality. Though their effects are small relative to health and demographic characteristics , both insomnia symptoms and depressive symptoms were associated with a greater hazard of death. Yet depressive symptoms accounted for the insomnia association when both were considered in the model. Screening for depression<symptom> and providing validated treatments may reduce mortality risk in old adults with depressive symptoms.
