 A study was performed to investigate whether expression of aquaporin ( AQP) 3 and 5 has potential as a marker for distinguishing dry<symptom> mouth<symptom> from Sjögren 's syndrome<disease><symptom>. Twenty-five patients underwent labial minor salivary gland biopsy ( dry<symptom> mouth<symptom> , n = 9; Sjögren 's syndrome<disease><symptom> , n = 16; control , n = 8). All patients were interviewed about their medical history and subjective oral symptoms , and intraoral examinations were conducted. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry were used to examine the expression and localization of AQP3 and 5. Significant differences in oral dryness , dry<symptom> eye , medical history , and Saxon test results were revealed among the groups. However , there were no significant inter-group differences in expression of mRNA for AQP3 and 5. Immunohistochemical staining for AQP3 was localized mainly in the basolateral and part of the ductal cell membrane , and was barely evident in the apical membrane of acinar cells. AQP5 was localized to the basolateral and apical membrane and cytoplasm , but not the ductal cell membrane. Staining intensity for AQP3 in the apical membrane was significantly stronger in Sjögren 's syndrome<disease><symptom> , and that for AQP5 was significantly weaker in dry<symptom> mouth<symptom>. Taken together , the present data suggest that expression of AQP3 and 5 may be a marker for distinguishing between patients with dry<symptom> mouth<symptom> and those with Sjögren 's syndrome<disease><symptom>.
