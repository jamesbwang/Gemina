 Tranexamic acid might be beneficial for cerebral hemorrhage<symptom>. However , the results remained controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the influence of tranexamic acid on cerebral hemorrhage<symptom>. PubMed , EMbase , Web of science , EBSCO , and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) assessing the effect of tranexamic acid on cerebral hemorrhage<symptom> were included. Two investigators independently searched articles , extracted data , and assessed the quality of included studies. This meta-analysis was performed using the random-effect model. Seven RCTs involving 1702 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall , compared with control intervention in cerebral hemorrhage<symptom> , tranexamic acid could significantly reduce growth of hemorrhagic mass ( RR = 0.78; 95 % CI = 0.61-0.99; P = 0.04) and unfavorable outcome ( RR = 0.75; 95 % CI = 0.61-0.93; P = 0.008) , but demonstrated no substantial influence on volume of hemorrhagic lesion<symptom> ( Std. MD = -0.10; 95 % CI = -0.27 to 0.08; P = 0.28) , neurologic deterioration ( RR = 1.25; 95 % CI = 0.60-2.60; P = 0.56) , rebleeding ( RR = 0.62; 95 % CI = 0.35-1.09; P = 0.10) , surgery requirement ( RR = 0.78; 95 % CI = 0.40-1.51; P = 0.46) , and mortality ( RR = 0.86; 95 % CI = 0.69-1.05; P = 0.14). Compared to control intervention in cerebral hemorrhage<symptom> , tranexamic acid was found to significantly decrease growth of hemorrhagic mass and unfavorable outcome , but showed no notable impact on volume of hemorrhagic lesion<symptom> , neurologic deterioration , rebleeding , surgery requirement and mortality.
