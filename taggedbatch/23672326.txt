 ( Purpose) This study aimed to investigate the effects of the therapeutic device combined with LED and microcurrent ( MC) on muscle<symptom> tone and stiffness in the calf muscle after its application during moderate aerobic exercise. ( Subjects and Methods) Twenty healthy adult subjects were randomized to either the test group of the therapeutic device combined with LED and MC or the control group , and they walked on a 10 %- sloped treadmill with a 5 km/hr speed for 30 minutes. Each of the subjects in the test group performed treadmill exercise with the therapeutic device attached to the edge of his or her calf muscle. After the exercise , the muscle<symptom> tone and stiffness at the edge of the calf muscle were measured. ( Results) With respect to the muscle<symptom> tone , a statistically significant difference was found between the two groups only 5 minutes after the exercise. Concerning muscle stiffness , significant differences were shown between the two groups right after the exercise and 5 minutes after the exercise. ( Conclusion) Integrated treatment with LED and MC on is considered helpful for lowering the muscle<symptom> tone 5 minutes after the exercise , and for lowering the muscle stiffness right after the exercise and 5 minutes after the exercise.
