 Objective Osteoarthritis is a painful , chronic joint disease affecting man and animals with no known curative therapies. Palliative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) are commonly used but they cause adverse side effects prompting the search for safer alternatives. To address this need , we evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of avocado/soybean unsaponifiables ( ASU) , glucosamine ( GLU) , and chondroitin sulfate ( CS) with or without the NSAID carprofen. Design Canine chondrocytes were propagated in microcarrier spinner culture and incubated with ( 1) control medium , ( 2) ASU ( 8.3 µg/mL) + GLU ( 11 µg/mL) + CS ( 20 µg/mL) combination for 24 hours; and/or carprofen ( 40 ng/mL). Cultures were next incubated with control medium alone or IL-1β ( 10 ng/mL) for another 24 hours. Production of PGE
