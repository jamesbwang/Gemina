 Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease in industrialized countries and the most common cause of left ventricular outflow tract ( LVOT) obstruction. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR) is an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement for intermediate to high-risk surgical candidates with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Conduction system abnormalities , including atrioventricular ( AV) and intraventricular ( IV) block , are the most common complication of TAVR. In this review , we aim to explore the anatomical issues relevant to atrioventricular block , the relevant clinical and procedural aspects , and the management and long-term implications of AV and IV block.
