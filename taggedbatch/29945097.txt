 Simulation-based education using standardized patients is recognized as an effective education method from which students can learn in a safe and controlled environment , and instructors can provide consistent education. It has been reported that the level of standardized patients ' satisfaction in the simulation experience positively affects to their case mastery and providing feedback to learners. This study aimed to explore standardized patients ' lived experiences on nursing simulation using qualitative research to provide empirical resources to facilitate collaboration with standardized patients for efficacious nursing simulation. Study participants were recruited from simulation centers and had experience with nursing simulation education as standardized patients within the last 3 years. Focus group interviews were conducted to explore experiences of the 12 standardized patients in nursing simulations. The focus group interviews were conducted with structured four steps of opening , transition , key , and ending questions , from which additional questions and discussions followed. They were recorded electronically and transcribed for analysis. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the data. Two researchers read the interview transcripts several times to become familiar with the content , and then interpreted them systematically. From the qualitative analysis of standardized patients ' experiences on nursing simulation , 23 codes , 10 sub-categories , 4 categories , and a theme were derived. It would be concluded that standardized patients have serving , learning , and interpersonal needs on their simulation , which may be related to their experiences in the simulation that affects learning outcomes of the students ' as well. By facilitating positive experiences of standardized patients , quality of nursing simulation could be increased to provide more active and effective learning opportunities for students.
