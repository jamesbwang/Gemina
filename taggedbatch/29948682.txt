 Clogging is a major operational and maintenance issue associated with the use of constructed wetlands. In this study , four lab-scale vertical flow constructed wetlands ( VFCW) were used to fully understand the development mechanisms of various types of clogging and their recovery characteristics. The VFCWs were fed with glucose solution , starch suspension with and without bacteriostat , glucose , and starch mixed solution , respectively , to simulate Bio-clogging , organic particle clogging ( Op-clogging) , inert particle clogging ( Ip-clogging) , and the combination of Bio-clogging and Op-clogging ( C-clogging). Resting operations with water decline were applied to relieve the clogging in the VFCWs. The results indicate that Op-clogging occurred first , followed by C-clogging and Bio-clogging. Ip-clogging took the longest time to develop and did not occur by the end of this study. The microscope analysis found that the extracellular polymeric substances ( EPS) bonded the starch particles together to form a dense membrane-like structure and promoted the clogging process. In addition , surface clogging was observed in all four experimental beds. Op-clogging occurred much closer to the surface than those caused by soluble organic matter and inert particles. Furthermore , the growth of biofilm caused significant decline in hydraulic conductivity , whereas its influence on porosity was relatively slight. Moreover , applying resting operation with water decline was effective for recovery from Bio-clogging , Op-clogging , and C-clogging in VFCWs except for Ip-clogging. The results also implied the recovery rates through applying resting operation with water decline were much higher than that with constant water level.
