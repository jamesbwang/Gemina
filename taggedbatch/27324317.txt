 Breast reconstruction following mastectomy has proven benefits and is the standard of care in many high-income countries. This audit documented regional variation in immediate breast reconstruction rates across Australia. The Breast Surgeons of Australia and New Zealand ( BreastSurgANZ) Quality Audit database and geospatial software were used to model the distribution of breast reconstructions performed on women having mastectomy in Australia in 2013. Geospatial mapping identified the distribution of these procedures in relation to the Greater Capital City Statistical Areas ( GCCSAs) of the five largest states. Data were analysed using χ Of 3786 patients having a mastectomy , 692 underwent breast reconstruction of which 679 ( 98 · 1 per cent) were immediate reconstructions. Rates of reconstruction differed significantly between jurisdictions ( χ Variations in the rate of immediate breast reconstruction may not be purely resource-driven.
