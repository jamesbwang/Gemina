 To assess the binding of the PET tracer ( The study included 20 PPA patients consecutively recruited through a memory clinic ( 12 NFV , 5 SV , 3 LV) , and 20 healthy controls. All participants received an extensive neurolinguistic assessment , magnetic resonance imaging and amyloid biomarker tests. ( Patients with NFV showed increased binding in the supplementary motor area , left premotor cortex , thalamus , basal ganglia and midbrain compared with controls and patients with SV. Patients with SV had increased binding in the temporal lobes bilaterally and in the right ventromedial frontal cortex compared with controls and patients with NFV. The whole-brain voxel-wise regression analysis revealed a correlation between agrammatism and motor<symptom> speech<symptom> impairment , and ( (
