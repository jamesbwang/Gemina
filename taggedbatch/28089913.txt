 At the point of care , evidence from randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) is underutilized in helping clinicians meet their information needs. To design interactive visual displays to help clinicians interpret and compare the results of relevant RCTs for the management of a specific patient , and to conduct a formative evaluation with physicians comparing interactive visual versus narrative displays. We followed a user-centered and iterative design process succeeded by development of information display prototypes as a Web-based application. We then used a within-subjects design with 20 participants ( 8 attendings and 12 residents) to evaluate the usability and problem-solving impact of the information displays. We compared subjects ' perceptions of the interactive visual displays versus narrative abstracts. The resulting interactive visual displays present RCT results side-by-side according to the Population , Intervention , Comparison , and Outcome ( PICO) framework. Study participants completed 19 usability tasks in 3 to 11 seconds with a success rate of 78 % to 100 %. Participants favored the interactive visual displays over narrative abstracts according to perceived efficiency , effectiveness , effort , user experience and preference ( all P values < .001). When interpreting and applying RCT findings to case vignettes , physicians preferred interactive graphical and PICO-framework-based information displays that enable direct comparison of the results from multiple RCTs compared to the traditional narrative and study-centered format. Future studies should investigate the use of interactive visual displays to support clinical decision making in care settings and their effect on clinician and patient outcomes.
