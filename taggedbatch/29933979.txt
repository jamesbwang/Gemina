 Various 1,3,4-oxadiazole thioether derivatives containing 2-chloro-5-methylene pyridine , 2-chloro-5-methylene thiazole , 3,4-dimethoxy-2-methylene pyridine , and N,N-dimethyl-2-ethylamino moieties were designed , synthesized , and assessed for their antibacterial activities against Xanthomonas<pathogen> oryzae<pathogen> pv. oryzae<pathogen> ( Xoo) via the turbidimeter test in vitro. Preliminary bioassay results confirmed good antibacterial activities for most of these compounds. Among these substances , compound 6r showed the best inhibitory effect against Xoo , and its half-maximal effective concentration ( EC
