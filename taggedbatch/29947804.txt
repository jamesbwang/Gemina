 Recent neuroanatomical pattern recognition studies have shown some promises for developing an objective neuroimaging-based classification related to schizophrenia. This study explored the feasibility of reliably identifying schizophrenia using single and multimodal multivariate neuroimaging features. Multiple brain measures including regional gray matter ( GM) volume , cortical thickness , gyrification , fractional anisotropy ( FA) , and mean diffusivity ( MD) were extracted using fully automated procedures. We used Gradient Boosting Decision Tree to identify the most frequently selected features of each set of neuroanatomical metric and fused multimodal measures. The current classification model was trained and validated based on 98 patients with first-episode schizophrenia ( FES) and 106 matched healthy controls ( HCs). The classification model was trained and tested in an independent dataset of 54 patients with FES and 48 HCs using imaging data acquired on a different magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Using the most frequently selected features from fused structural and diffusion tensor imaging metrics , a classification accuracy of 75.05 % was achieved , which was higher than accuracy derived from a single imaging metric. Most prominent discriminative features included cortical thickness of left transverse temporal gyrus and right parahippocampal gyrus , the FA of left corticospinal tract and right external capsule. In the independent cohort , average accuracy was 76.54 % , derived from combined features selected from cortical thickness , gyrification , FA , and MD.. These features characterized by GM abnormalities and white matter disruptions have discriminative power with respect to the underlying pathological changes in the brain of individuals having schizophrenia. Our results further highlight the potential advantage of multimodal data fusion for identifying schizophrenia.
