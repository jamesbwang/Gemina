 Recent tomographic imaging of the mantle below major hot spots shows slow seismic velocities extending down to the core-mantle boundary , confirming the existence of mantle plumes. However , these plumes are much thicker than previously thought. Using new laboratory experiments and scaling laws , we show that thermal plumes developing in a visco-plastic fluid present much larger diameters than plumes developing in a Newtonian fluid. Such a rheology requiring a yield stress is consistent with a lower mantle predominantly deforming by pure dislocation climb. Yield stress values between 1 and 10 MPa , implying dislocation densities between 10
