 Cleft palate in dogs is a congenital defect that mostly leads to euthanasia of the affected puppy. If an attempt is made to raise the puppy , it is generally fed via an orogastric tube. Here , we describe the management of cleft palate in three puppies ( two Boxers , one Collie) using a customised temporary prosthesis , which allowed the puppies to be bottle-fed and successfully raised by their owners ( Cases 2 and 3) and the author ( Case 1). The temporary palatal prosthesis was manufactured from a mouthguard intended for human children , which is made of thermoplastic silicone. The preparation procedure was simple and cost-effective. All puppies underwent corrective surgery at 5 ‚Åª 6 months of age. After surgery , one of the Boxer puppies showed mandibular mesioclusion , while the other two showed no aberrations. All puppies gained the same amount of weight as their littermates , although the weight gain of the two Boxers was slower than that of their littermates. In summary , this case report describes an easy and effective way to raise puppies with cleft palate until corrective surgery can be performed.
