 By disruption of LaeB , a global regulator recently characterized in Aspergillus<pathogen> nidulans<pathogen> , eight cryptic compounds in the mutant were identified , including seven polyketides and one NRPS-like product. Among the isolates , two phthalides and two dibenzo ( 1,4) dioxins are new compounds , revealing that the genetic manipulation of the global regulator represents a promising approach for the discovery of novel natural products in fungi<pathogen>.
