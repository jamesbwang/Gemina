 Current guidelines recommend that serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen ( CTX) and serum procollagen type 1 aminoterminal propeptide ( PINP) , measured by standardized assays , be used as reference markers in observational and interventional studies. However , there are limited data to determine whether serum CTX and PINP are associated with hip fracture risk among postmenopausal women. We determined the associations of serum CTX and serum PINP with hip fracture risk among postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years at baseline. We performed a prospective case-control study ( 400 cases , 400 controls) nested in the Women 's Health Initiative Observational Study , which enrolled participants at 40 US clinical centers. Cases were women with incident hip fracture not taking osteoporosis medication; hip fractures were confirmed using medical records. Untreated controls were matched by age , race/ethnicity , and date of blood sampling. Serum CTX and serum PINP were analyzed on 12-hour fasting blood samples. The main outcome measure was incident hip fracture risk ( mean follow-up 7.13 years). After adjustment for body mass index , smoking , frequency of falls , history of fracture , calcium and vitamin D intake , and other relevant covariates , neither serum CTX level nor serum PINP level was statistically significantly associated with hip fracture risk ( CTX p
