 This study aimed for a comparative evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of calcium hydroxide , chlorhexidine gel , and a curcumin-based formulation against Thirty single-rooted teeth were taken. Access preparation was done. Biomechanical preparation was done using Protaper universal file till F3. Teeth were decoronated to a standardized root length of 14 mm , and the apical end from outside was sealed using paraffin wax. Teeth were autoclaved under standard conditions and after autoclaving , Phosphate-buffered saline solution was introduced into the roots and was incubated for 24 h to check for the disinfection of roots. Once the disinfection of roots was achieved , the wild strain of Significant difference was observed between all the test groups. However , chlorhexidine gel showed the best value of mean difference , indicating it as the best antibacterial medicament. Within the limitations of this study , it can be concluded that chlorhexidine gel showed better antimicrobial properties against
