 The purpose of the study was to optimize the technique of removing the trunk of the great saphenous vein ( GSV) in patients over 60 years. The study included a total of eighty-five patients aged over 60 years and presenting with primary varicose veins of the lower limbs and undergoing operations performed on the superficial venous system , including all stages of classical phlebectomy- crossectomy , stripping of the GSV , removal of tributaries and ligation of incompetent perforant veins. The patients were divided into two groups: the Study Group ( n = 44) patients endured removal of the GSV with the use of the technique of temporal tamponing of the canal , while in Group Two patients , composing a comparison group ( n = 41) , the GSV was removed without the use of a tampon. The groups of the patients were comparable by the main characteristics , as well as by the CEAP class and the types of the operations performed. The results of treatment were studied clinically with the use of the Venous Clinical Severity Score ( VCSS). In the Study Group patients , the average VCSS score decreased from 1.52 ± 0.11 to 0.47 ± 0.05 ( p = 0.007) and in the Comparison Group from 1.21 ± 0.11 to 0.85 ± 0.06 ( p = 0.028). In the remote terms after the operation , in the Study Group patients the average VCSS score appeared to be 2 times lower than in the control group , amounting to 0.47 ± 0.05 and 0.85 ± 0.06 , respectively ( p = 0.007). A conclusion was drawn that in surgical treatment of varicose veins in elderly and aged patients while removing the grate saphenous vein , it is appropriate to use the technique of temporary tamponing of the canal , which is associated with better results in the remote period as compared to the traditional stripping.
