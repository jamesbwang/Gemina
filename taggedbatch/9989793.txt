 In healthy skin , epidermis and dermis are anchored together at the dermal-epidermal junction ( DEJ) , a specialized basement membrane pivotal for skin integrity and function. However , increased inflammation<symptom> in the DEJ is associated with the disruption and separation of this junction and sub-epidermal blistering. Granzyme B ( GzmB) is a serine protease secreted by immune cells. Dysregulated inflammation<symptom> may lead to increased GzmB accumulation and proteolysis in the extracellular milieu. Although elevated GzmB is observed at the level of the DEJ in inflammatory and blistering skin conditions , the present study is the first to explore GzmB in the context of DEJ degradation in autoimmune sub-epidermal blistering. In the present study , GzmB induced separation of the DEJ in healthy human skin. Subsequently , α6/β4 integrin , collagen VII , and collagen XVII were identified as extracellular substrates for GzmB through western blot , and specific cleavage sites were identified by mass spectrometry. In human bullous pemphigoid , dermatitis<disease> herpetiformis , and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita , GzmB was elevated at the DEJ when compared to healthy samples , while α6/β4 integrin , collagen VII , and collagen XVII were reduced or absent in the area of blistering. In summary , our results suggest that regardless of the initial causation of sub-epidermal blistering , GzmB activity is a common final pathway that could be amenable to a single targeted treatment approach.
