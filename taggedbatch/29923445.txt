 The Institute of Medicine ( IOM) suggests that linkages between primary care practices and community-based resources can improve health in lower income and minority patients , but examples of these are rare. We conducted a prospective , mixed-methods observational study to identify indicators of primary care-community linkage associated with the frequency of visits to community-based senior centers and improvements in diabetes-related outcomes among 149 new senior center members ( 72 % Hispanic). We used semistructured interviews at baseline and 9-month follow-up , obtaining visit frequency from member software and clinical assessments including hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c) from colocated primary care clinics. Members ' discussion of their activities with their primary care providers ( PCPs) was associated with increased visits to the senior centers , as well as diabetes-related improvements. Direct feedback from the senior centers to their PCPs was desired by the majority of members and may help to reinforce use of community resources for self-management support.
