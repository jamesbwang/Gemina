 Although endovascular repair of abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysms<disease> ( AAAs) has been demonstrated to have favorable outcomes , not all cohorts of patients with AAA fare equally well. Our goal was to investigate perioperative and 1-year outcomes in patients with end-stage renal disease ( ESRD) on dialysis , who have traditionally fared worse after vascular interventions , to assess how ESRD affects outcomes in a large modern cohort of endovascular aneurysm<disease> repair ( EVAR) patients. The Vascular Quality Initiative database was queried for all patients undergoing EVAR from 2010 to 2017. ESRD patients were compared with patients not on dialysis. Propensity-matched scoring and multivariable analysis were used to isolate the effects of ESRD. Of 28,683 EVARs identified , there were 321 ( 1.12 %) patients with ESRD on dialysis. Patients with ESRD had no difference in presenting AAA size ( 57.5 ± 12.7 mm vs 56.7 ± 17.2 mm; P = .44); however , they had more urgent/emergent repairs ( 20.6 % vs 13.6 %; P = .002) than those without ESRD. ESRD patients were more often younger , nonwhite , and nonobese and less likely to have commercial insurance ( P < .05). ESRD patients more often had hypertension , coronary artery disease , congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , previous lower extremity bypass , aneurysm<disease> repair , and carotid interventions ( P < .05). There was no difference in the rate of concomitant procedures. Matching based on demographics , comorbidities , and operative details showed that ESRD patients had longer hospital length of stay ( 4.8 ± 9.4 days vs 4.1 ± 12.6 days; P = .026) and higher 30-day mortality ( 7 % vs 2.4 %; P < .001). There was no difference in cardiac , pulmonary , lower extremity , bowel , and stroke complications or return to the operating room. On multivariable analysis , ESRD was associated with 30-day mortality ( odds ratio , 4.1; 95 % confidence interval , 2.6-6.7; P < .001). Of the 24,750 elective EVARs , 1.04 % had ESRD on dialysis. Matched data for elective EVAR show increased postoperative length of stay , hospital mortality , and 30-day mortality for ESRD patients on dialysis compared with those who are not. There was no association with postoperative myocardial infarction or pulmonary complications. At 1 year , patients with ESRD on dialysis had worse survival ( 78 % vs 94 %; P < .001) , and ESRD was associated with higher mortality ( hazard ratio , 3.3; 95 % confidence interval , 2.5-4.2; P < .001). Among patients undergoing EVAR , ESRD is independently associated with higher perioperative and 1-year mortality despite not being associated with higher postoperative complications. This should be taken into account during informed consent for EVAR and risk-benefit considerations in this high-risk population , particularly for elective repair.
