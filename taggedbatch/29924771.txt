 The study was aimed at assessing the dynamics of asymptomatic atherosclerosis of carotid arteries ( CA) depending upon the achieved level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDLC) in patients with moderate total risk by the SCORE scale. We followed up a total of eighty-two 40-to-65-year-old patients with the LDLC level above 2.6 mmol/l , being at moderate total risk by the SCORE scale and having symptom-free atherosclerosis of the extracranial portion of brachiocephalic arteries ( up to 50 % narrowing of their lumen) as diagnosed by duplex scanning. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group One patients ( n = 41) received therapy with atorvastatin in order to achieve the LDLC level less than 1.8 mmol/l. Group Two patients ( n = 41) were treated in order to achieve the LDLC level below 2.6 mmol/l. At 12 months of follow up we compared the dynamics of carotid atherosclerosis ( change in the number , total height , structure , echogenicity , as well as the state of the surface of atherosclerotic plaques , alteration of the thickness of the CA intima-media complex). Group Two patients were found to have an increase in the number and average sum of the heights of atherosclerotic plaques. An increase of the maximum thickness of the intima-media complex of the wall of the right and left CA was more pronounced as compared with that in Group One patients. Aggressive hypolipidemic therapy aimed at achieving the LDLC level below 1.8 mmol/l turned out to be more effective in slowing down the progression of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis in patients with moderate cardiovascular risk than therapy targeted at achieving the LDLC level below 2.6 mmol/l.
