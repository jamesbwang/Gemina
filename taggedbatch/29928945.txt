 TMPRSS6 gene mutations can result in iron deficiency anemia<symptom> ( IDA) and cause an increased iron-regulatory hormone , hepcidin , levels. TMPRSS6 encodes a serine protease , matriptase-2 , which functions as negative regulatory protein of hepcidin transcription. Thus , TMPRSS6 variations might be risk factors for IDA. The aim of the study was to investigate the association of rs855791 , rs4820268 , rs5756506 , rs2235324 , rs2413450 , rs2111833 , rs228919 , and rs733655 SNPs in TMPRSS6 gene with IDA susceptibility and iron-related clinical parameters. The study consisted of 150 IDA patients and 100 healthy controls. We analyzed the genotype distributions by using Real-Time polymerase chain reaction ( Real-Time PCR) technique. We did not find any statistically differences for all SNPs between patients and controls ( P > 0.05). In IDA patients , variations rs855791 and rs2413450 were associated with increased RBC ( P = 0.03) and TIBC ( P = 0.04) , respectively. Also , increased of TIBC for rs4820268 ( P < 0.05). On the other hand , in control group , rs5756506 was associated with two parameters , Hb ( P = 0.02) and Hct ( P = 0.03). We did not find markedly hepcidin levels in IDA patients compared to controls ( P = 0.32). Our findings suggest that TMPRSS6 variations may not be risk factors for IDA. However , TMPRSS6 polymorphisms are associated with increased many iron-related hematological parameters.
