 Due to depletion of fossil fuel reserves , global warming , and the need for energy efficiency , the new energy resource is required. For this purpose , hydrogen can be considered as clean and efficient energy carrier. In this study , biohydrogen production from physical pretreated mixed culture was investigated. In this study , the optimal conditions for physical pretreatment of mixed culture were investigated for the enrichment of hydrogen-producing bacteria ( HPB). Three individual pretreatment processes , including thermal , ultraviolet ( UV) radiation , and ultrasonication ( US) were conducted in batch tests. The batch tests were carried out via 500 mL glass flasks with working volume 400 mL. Glucose was used as sole substrate , and other essential nutrient and trace elements were added. To agitation of substrate with HPB inoculum , the magnet stirrer was used at 60 rpm. The results showed the production of H The Gompertz model depicts that all
