 Bietti 's crystalline dystrophy ( BCD) is a rare autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy characterized by deposition of crystals in the retina. The purpose of this article is to describe retinal abnormalities in BCD using multimodal imaging. An 18-year-old girl presented with decrease of vision and nyctalopia. She was assessed with color fundus picture , red-free photographs , short-wave autofluorescence , spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( OCT) and en face OCT and was diagnosed to have BCD based on typical presentation. Retinal crystals were better visualized on en face OCT as compared to conventional B scan OCT..
