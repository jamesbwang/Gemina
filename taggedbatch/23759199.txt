 Fatigue<symptom> and sleepiness are inter-related and common among road transport drivers. In this study , sleep deprivation and fatigue<symptom> among chemical transportation drivers were examined. A cross-sectional study surveying 107 drivers from three hazardous types of chemical production and transportation industries ( nonflammable gases , flammable gases , and flammable liquids) was conducted. Data on sleep deprivation were collected using questionnaires of the Stanford Sleeping Scale and the Groningen Sleep Quality Scale. Fatigue<symptom> was assessed using an interview questionnaire and a flicker fusion instrument. Chemical drivers had a mean sleeping scale ( Stanford Sleeping Scale) of 1.98 ( standard deviation 1.00) and had a mean score of 1.89 ( standard deviation 2.06) on the Groningen Sleep Quality Scale. High-risk drivers had higher scores in both the Stanford Sleeping Scale and the Groningen Sleep Quality Scale with a mean score of 2.59 and 4.62 , respectively , and those differences reached statistical significance ( Sleep quality and sleeping hour can affect a driver 's fatigue<symptom>. Optimization of work-rest model should be considered to improve productivity , driver retention , and road safety.
