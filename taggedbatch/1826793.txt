 Ascites is an abnormal accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity. The most common cause of ascites in the United States population is portal hypertension secondary to cirrhosis , accounting for about 80 % of the cases. Other etiologies include malignancy , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , tuberculosis<disease> , and pancreatic disease. After an extensive literature review , it is to our best knowledge that there have been no cases reported on autoimmune ascites. We present an interesting case of ascites in a 67-year-old Caucasian male with symptoms of recurrent abdominal<symptom> distention<symptom> and significant weight gain , refractory to standard therapies. An extensive 3-year long workup was only significant for serum-ascites albumin gradient > 1.1 g/dL , ascitic fluid protein of 3.0 g/dL , and peritoneal biopsies showing minor inflammatory changes. Both common and rare causes of ascites were ruled out. Empiric treatment with mycophenolate mofetil ( CellCept) resulted in resolution of symptoms with no need for a repeat paracentesis for > 2 years , suggesting the diagnosis of autoimmune ascites.
