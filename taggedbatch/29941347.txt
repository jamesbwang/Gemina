 Varicocele is a common condition seen in adolescence and associated with adult subfertility. Numerous types of intervention have been described with differences in success and complication rates. This study aims to review and compare the surgical outcomes of laparoscopic Palomo surgery and scrotal antegrade sclerotherapy at our center. A retrospective analysis was done of all patients younger than 18 years old with idiopathic varicocele treated operatively between February 2001 and December 2016. Demographics such as age at operation , side , varicocele grade , operative date , and types of operation were collected. Primary outcomes were clinical recurrence , defined as any grading noted on follow-up within 1 year post-op and post-operative hydrocele. Secondary outcomes were operative time , length of stay , and other surgical complications. Mann-Whitney U test , independent t test and chi-square tests were used for analysis. All p-values were two-sided and considered statistically significant at p â‰¤ 0.05. A total of 119 patients fit the criteria , of whom 117 patients were included in data analysis ( Table). Sixty-two patients had laparoscopic Palomo surgery ( LPS) and 55 had scrotal antegrade sclerotherapy ( SAS). Clinical recurrence ( grade 2-3) within 1 year was similar between the two groups , with four out of 48 patients in the SAS group and six out of 62 patients in the LPS group ( 8.4 % in SAS vs. 9.7 % in LPS , p = 1.00). Of the 11 patients who had recurrence in the SAS group , seven had grade 1 recurrence ( 14.5 %) , two ( 4.2 %) had grade 2 recurrence , and two ( 4.2 %) had grade 3 recurrence. For the LPS group , 17 out of 62 patients had clinical recurrence within 1 year , of whom 11 ( 17.7 %) had grade 1 recurrence , one ( 1.6 %) had grade 2 , and five ( 8.1 %) had grade 3 recurrence. Post-operative hydrocele was significantly higher in the LPS group; there was none in the SAS group but 11 patients in the LPS group ( 0 % in SAS vs. 17.7 % , p = 0.002). Three patients had clinically significant hydrocele requiring Jaboulays ' procedure. Complications other than hydrocele were noted in three patients in the SAS group and one patient in the LPS group ( 5.5 % in SAS vs. 1.6 % in LPS , p = 0.158). None required operative intervention. No conversion to open procedure was seen in the LPS group and there were no perioperative complications. Mean operative time was 62.9 min in the SAS group and 60.7 min in the LPS group ( p = 0.624). Mean length of stay was 17.5 h in the SAS group and 31.7 h in the LPS group ( p < 0.001). Both SAS and LPS are safe procedures for treatment of adolescent varicocele with similar clinical recurrence rate within 1 year. SAS has a significantly lower rate of post-operative hydrocele.
