 In this work , we reported an anthracene carboxyimide-based chemosensor ( AC-Phos) for colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescence detection of highly toxic phosgene , which displayed rapid response ( < 5 min) toward phosgene with a high selectivity and a low detection limit ( 2.3 nM). Furthermore , a facile testing membrane with a polystyrene immobilizing chemosensor has been fabricated for real-time visualizing of gaseous phosgene.
