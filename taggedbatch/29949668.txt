 The prognostic value of obesity is unestablished for renal cell carcinoma. We assessed the age-dependent prognostic value of body mass index ( BMI) in a large multicenter cohort of patients with non-metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( nm-cRCC). This study evaluated 2092 patients with nm-cRCC who underwent surgery with curative intent at five Korean institutions between 2001 and 2014. There was no significant difference in BMI between the young ( < 45 years) and older patients ( ≥ 45 years) ( P = 0.398). Among older patients , high BMI ( ≥ 25 kg/m Among patients with nm-cRCC , high BMI was associated with a favorable prognosis among older patients but not among young patients. Therefore , the relationship between obesity and nm-cRCC prognosis might vary according to age.
