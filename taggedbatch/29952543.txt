 We investigated the dewetting process on flat and chemically patterned surfaces of ultrathin films ( thickness between 2 and 15 nm) of a cylinder forming polystyrene- block-poly ( methyl methacrylate) ( PS- b-PMMA) spin coated on poly ( styrene- r-methyl methacrylate) random copolymers ( RCPs). When the PS- b-PMMA film dewets on a 2 nm-thick RCP layer , the ordering of the hexagonally packed PMMA cylinders in the dewetted structures extends over distances far exceeding the correlation length obtained in continuous block copolymer ( BCP) films. As a result , micrometer-sized circular droplets featuring defectless single grains of self-assembled PS- b-PMMA with PMMA cylinders perpendicularly oriented with respect to the substrate are generated and randomly distributed on the substrate. Additionally , alignment of the droplets along micrometric lines was achieved by performing the dewetting process on large-scale chemically patterned stripes of 2 nm thick RCP films by laser lithography. By properly adjusting the periodicity of the chemical pattern , it was possible to tune and select the geometrical characteristics of the dewetted droplets in terms of maximum thickness , contact angle and diameter while maintaining the defectless single grain perpendicular cylinder morphology of the circular droplets.
