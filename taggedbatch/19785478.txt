 People often assume that moral and religious convictions are functionally the same thing. But are they? We report on 19 studies ( N = 12,284) that tested whether people 's perceptions that their attitudes are reflections of their moral and religious convictions across 30 different issues were functionally the same ( the equivalence hypothesis) or different constructs ( the distinct constructs hypothesis) , and whether the relationship between these constructs was conditional on political orientation ( the political asymmetry hypothesis). Seven of these studies ( N = 5,561 , and 22 issues) also had data that allowed us to test whether moral and religious conviction are only closely related for those who are more rather than less religious ( the secularization hypothesis) , and a narrower form of the political asymmetry and secularization hypotheses , that is , that people 's moral and religious convictions may be tightly connected constructs only for religious conservatives. Meta-analytic tests of each of these hypotheses yielded weak support for the secularization hypothesis , no support for the equivalence or political asymmetry hypotheses , and the strongest support for the distinct constructs hypothesis.
