 A number of studies have demonstrated that the Sirtuin family member , Sirt1 , is a key integrator of growth , metabolism , and lifespan. Sirt1 directly interacts with and deacetylates key regulators of the circadian clock , positioning it to be an important link between feeding and circadian rhythms. In fact , one study suggests that Sirt1 is necessary for behavioral anticipation of limited daily food availability , a circadian process termed food anticipatory activity ( FAA). In their study , mice overexpressing Sirt1 had enhanced FAA , while mice lacking Sirt1 had little to no FAA. Based on the supposition that Sirt1 was indeed required for FAA , we sought to use Sirt1 deletion to map the neural circuitry responsible for FAA. We began by inactivating Sirt1 using the cell-type specific Cre-driver lines proopiomelanocortin , but after observing no effect on body<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom> or FAA we then moved on to more broadly neuronal Cre drivers Ca2 +/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and nestin. As neither of these neuronal deletions of Sirt1 had impaired FAA , we then tested 1) a broad postnatal tamoxifen-inducible deletion , 2) a complete , developmental knockout of Sirt1 , and 3) a gene replacement , catalytically inactive , form of Sirt1; but all of these mice had FAA similar to controls. Therefore , our findings suggest that FAA is completely independent of Sirt1.
