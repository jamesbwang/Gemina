 The agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARγ) from natural victual products were used as antidiabetic agents. Faba bean ( Vicia faba L.) is a consequential legume that was known to possess potential antidiabetic activity , whose mechanism of action was unknown. The current study was focused to ascertain gene expression of the nuclear receptor PPARγ by Faba bean pod extract in rat cell lines ( RINm5F). The real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that Faba bean pod extract in concentrations of 160 µg/mL have shown 4.97-fold stimulation compared with control. The cells treated with 320 µg/mL has shown 5.89-fold upregulation , respectively. Furthermore , in silico docking analysis was carried out against PPARγ , using the bioactive compounds identified from Faba bean pod extracts , which were known reported compounds from the literature. The results suggest that gene expression of PPARγ was inhibited by the constituents in Faba bean. In silico analysis prognosticates , butein has a high binding energy ( -8.6 kcal/mol) with an atomic contact energy of -214.10 , followed by Apigenin and Quercetin against PPARγ. Similarly , the percentage of interaction was high for butein , followed by Apigenin and Quercetin than other compounds comparatively. Hence , the results conclude inhibition of PPARγ by the bioactive compounds from Faba bean , which may provide insights into developing future therapeutic molecules for diabetes mellitus.
