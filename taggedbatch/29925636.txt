 KRAS is the most frequently mutated driver oncogene in human adenocarcinoma of the lung. There are presently no clinically proven strategies for treatment of KRAS-driven lung cancer. Activating mutations in KRAS are thought to confer independence from upstream signaling; however , recent data suggest that this independence may not be absolute. We show that initiation and progression of KRAS-driven lung tumors require input from ERBB family receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs): Multiple ERBB RTKs are expressed and active from the earliest stages of KRAS-driven lung tumor development , and treatment with a multi-ERBB inhibitor suppresses formation of KRAS
