 Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis can restore gastrointestinal continuity in patients requiring colectomy for ulcerative colitis<disease> , however , it can be associated with high morbidity. Reoperation for pouch-related complications is technically challenging and often leads to deterioration of pouch function or need for permanent stoma. We report a case of acute on chronic small bowel obstruction secondary to a 360-degree twist in the small bowel introduced during creation of the ileal-anal pouch. Our novel approach at repair has not been reported in past literature which included resection and re-anastomosis of the small bowel proximal to the pouch allowing for pouch salvage with return to function.
