 Knowledge and awareness about occupational therapy ( OT) are essential for the delivery of quality care to all clients and for occupational therapists ' ( OTRs) job satisfaction. OT has been a poorly understood profession in Jordan. The current study reports on the assessment of Jordanians ' awareness and knowledge of occupational therapy. Convenience sampling was used. There were 829 participants ( 474 males , 355 females) , with mean age of 32 Â± 11.6 yrs. They were recruited from the three main geographical areas of Jordan ( northern , central , and southern) and from all educational levels. The sample included 222 ( 26.8 %) healthcare personnel , 146 ( 17.6 %) clients , and 461 ( 55.6 %) lay persons. Participants completed questionnaires , and the results revealed that 48 % of the sample had poor or no knowledge about OT , while 28.3 % were unaware of it. Also , OT was commonly ( 50 %) perceived to be exclusively targeting people with disabilities ( PWDs) and neurological and physical conditions ( 58 % and 53 % , resp.) in addition to exclusively providing services for the rehabilitation of the upper extremity ( 48 %). Common misconceptions associated with OT were that OTRs prescribe medication ( 43 %) and OTRs are physiotherapists ( 44 %). These preliminary findings suggest that efforts need to be directed by OTRs , the Jordanian Society of Occupational Therapy ( JSOT) , and the Ministry of Health to preserve the OT identity and value and promote knowledge about OT in the public and among members of interdisciplinary teams. More interprofessional learning needs to be incorporated within the curricula and placements of all healthcare personnels.
