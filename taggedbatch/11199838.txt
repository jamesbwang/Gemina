 To evaluate 58 unirradicular teeth were instrumented with MTwo Â® and divided into 3 groups according to irrigation protocol: 17 TA , laser and a combination of 17 TA and laser. All samples were analyzed in the apical and middle third with Scanning Electron Microscope. The Chi-cuadrado and McNemar tests were used to determine the statistical analysis and data processing and analysis was performed with the statistical package StatGraphics Centurion XVI. Debris analysis showed statistical significant differences when compared EDTA vs laser and EDTA vs EDTA + laser in the middle third. The Smear Layer removal showed statistical significant differences in the middle third when compared EDTA vs laser and EDTA vs EDTA + laser. Laser showed a greater cleaning capacity than EDTA in the middle third; the cleanliness was even better when combined laser with EDTA , so the effect is accumulative.
