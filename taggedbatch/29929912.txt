 The purpose of this study was to identify whether the incidence of systematically identified or incidentally encountered facial<symptom> nerve branches during dissection to approach condylar fractures increases risk of transient and/or permanent facial<symptom> nerve<symptom> weakness<symptom>. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed that included several databases with specific keywords , a reference search , and a manual search for suitable articles. The inclusion criteria were all clinical trials , with the aim of assessing the rate of facial<symptom> nerve injuries when open reduction and internal fixation ( ORIF) of condylar process fractures was performed using different surgical approaches. The articles had to have documented the number of encountered facial<symptom> nerve branches during ORIF. The main outcome variable was transient and permanent facial<symptom> nerve injury. The dependent variable was the event and/or number of encountered facial<symptom> nerve branches during surgery , and how they were handled ( i.e. dissected , retracted , etc.). A total of 1202 mandibular condylar fractures were enrolled in 29 studies. Rate of transient<symptom> facial<symptom> nerve injury ( TFNI) was 11.3 % ( 136/1202). The number of facial<symptom> nerve branches encountered intraoperatively was 543 , namely buccal , marginal mandibular , zygomatic and temporal nerve branches. There was a significant correlation suggesting that there is a strong positive linear relationship between TFNI and encountered facial<symptom> nerve branches ( Coef = 0.1916 , P = 0.001). There was no significant relationship between permanent facial<symptom> nerve injury and encountered facial<symptom> nerve branches ( P = 0.808). TFNI was 4.3 % and 18.7 % for those studies expressly reporting that facial<symptom> nerve branches were encountered incidentally without dissection and with dissection , respectively. For studies reporting deliberate and systematic facial<symptom> nerve dissection , TFNI was 20.9 %. Finally , studies that did not report any encounters of facial<symptom> nerve branches , TFNI was 7.9 %. This meta-analysis demonstrated that manipulation of the facial<symptom> nerve during different surgical approaches causes different incidences of facial<symptom> nerve injury. The choice of surgical approach for a given fracture should take this into consideration.
