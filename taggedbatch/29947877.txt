 As part of 10-year documentation using the Columbus system , the interim evaluation was carried out 5 years after implantation with a collection of clinical scores , evaluation of radiological imaging and collection of statistics concerning complications. There was a multicentre prospective recruitment of consecutive patients with the indication of implantation of a surface replacement prosthesis ( Columbus CR , Deep Dish fixed inlay). Preoperatively , clinical scores were recorded ( KSS and Oxford score). Five years postoperatively a new evaluation of clinical scores , the range of motion ( ROM) and a radiological check-up including full leg imaging under load was performed. During this period , detailed complication documentation was made. A total of 210 patients were recruited in five centres. 187 patients were available for examination 5 years after surgery. Cumulative KSS increased from 87.5 ( ± 26.6) preoperatively to 170 ( ± 29.1) 5 years postoperatively. The cumulative KSS improvement was 81.5 ( ± 35.2) points and was highly significant ( p < 0.0001; t‑test). The average functional improvement in the Oxford score between the preoperative and 5‑year follow-up was 21.7 ( ± 8.8) points and was also highly significant ( p < 0.0001). The ROM improved from 106.3 ° ( ± 20.2) preoperatively to 114.0 ° ( ± 12.1) 5 years postoperatively ( p < 0.0001; t test). Five years after implantation , the average mechanical leg axis was 178.0 ° ( ± 2.1). There was no clinically apparent or native radiologic visible aseptic loosening of the femoral or tibial joint component. There were 33 complications , but no implant-related complications such as inlay dislocation , material fracture or aseptic loosening. In total , 6 revision surgeries were performed during the follow-up period , which corresponds to a survival rate of 97.1 % ( CI 95 %) for the implanted Columbus knee in the present patient collective for 5 years. The interim analysis at 5 years of long-term observation of the Columbus system provided good clinical and radiographic results.
