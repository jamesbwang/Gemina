 Recent studies revealed that colorectal tumors are composed of genetically diverse subclones. We aimed to clarify whether the surface microstructures of colorectal tumors are associated with genetic intratumoral heterogeneity ( ITH). The surface microstructures ( pit patterns) of colorectal tumors were observed using magnifying endoscopy , and biopsy specimens were obtained from respective areas when tumors exhibited multiple pit patterns. A total of 711 specimens from 477 colorectal tumors were analyzed for BRAF , KRAS and TP53 mutations using pyrosequencing and direct sequencing. A panel of cancer-related genes was analyzed through targeted sequencing in 7 tumors. Colorectal tumors with multiple pit patterns exhibited more advanced pit patterns and higher frequencies of KRAS and/or TP53 mutations than tumors with a single pit pattern. In tumors with multiple pit patterns , mutations were observed as public ( common to all areas) or private ( specific to certain areas) , and private KRAS and/or TP53 mutations were often variable and unrelated to the pit pattern grade. Notably , invasive CRCs frequently exhibited public TP53 mutations , even in adenomatous areas , which is indicative of their early malignant potential. Targeted sequencing revealed additional public and private mutations in tumors with multiple pit patterns , indicating their single clonal origin. Our results suggest intratumoral pit pattern variation does not simply reflect the process of colorectal tumor evolution , but instead represents genetically diverse subclones , and this diversity may be associated with malignant potential.
