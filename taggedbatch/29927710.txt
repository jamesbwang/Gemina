 Given the needs of the growing world population , the importance of the transportation sector has steadily increased. Maritime and aviation fields are considered two crucial parts of this sector. Transportation accidents must be minimized in order to ensure timely delivery of natural resources , sustainable production , and safety of life and property. Human error plays an important role in transportation accidents and is the cause of 70 % to 90 % of all aviation and maritime accidents. It is a well-known fact that these errors can be minimized by enhancing the perception of safety culture for individuals , corporations , and nations. In this study , a questionnaire survey was conducted among 318 Turkish people who work in different positions in the aviation and maritime industries. The perceptions of safety culture within different occupations and occupational groups were compared. Statistically significant differences were found between the aviation and maritime sectors.
