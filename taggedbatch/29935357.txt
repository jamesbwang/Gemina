 Myelocytomatosis ( MYC) transcription factors ( TFs) are key regulators of the jasmonic acid ( JA) signaling pathway. In cell cultures , methyl jasmonate ( MeJA) can improve the production of taxol , which is a complex terpenoid compound with an intense antitumor activity. However , the functions of MYC genes in Taxus sp. ( yew trees) remain poorly known. Based on Taxus sp. transcriptome changes induced by MeJA , a TcMYC gene was isolated in a previous study. Here , we further characterized the TcMYC TF encoded by that gene and four other yew MYC TFs previously obtained. Three yew MYC TFs had the typical basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH)- MYC_N region , but the other two MYC did not , although all five presented the bHLH domain. TcMYC was localized to the nuclei , and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the yew MYC TFs were closely related to Arabidopsis thaliana MYC1/2 and maize R protein. The yeast one-hybrid assay showed that TcMYC binds the G-box of the promoter of taxane 5Î±-hydroxylase. Transcript levels of TcMYC revealed that TcMYC was highly expressed in xylem and leaves , and up-regulated by drought and high-salinity stresses. Coronatine ( COR) has recently been used as a new elicitor to improve the production of taxol in cell cultures; TcMYC was strongly expressed at 2 and 4 h after COR treatment , but decreased at 12 and 24 h. Overall , the results obtained here provide new insights into the potential regulatory roles of MYC TFs on taxol biosynthesis in yew trees.
