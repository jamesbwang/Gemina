 Recent studies have shown that diversity in race and gender is important to improve competitiveness , creativity and innovation. However , many studies have shown that the universe of science is not diverse in none of these criteria. In this work , we quantify the gender and geographic diversity in the Brazilian science. We study in detail the profile of the titular members of the most prestigious academic institution of Brazil , the Brazilian Academy of Sciences ( ABC). Our analysis shows that the members of the ABC concentrates 80 % in the Southeast region and that the overwhelming majority is composed by men. We show that female and male researchers have roughly the same amount of publication per year but women produce more human resources. Using the Brazilian Researchers ' Fellowship databank we show that the gender and diversity both in gender and in geography decreases along the researchers ' career.
