 Short bowel syndrome<disease><symptom> ( SBS) occurs in patients who have had extensive resection. The primary physiologic consequence is malabsorption , resulting in fluid and electrolyte abnormalities and malnutrition. Nutrient digestion , absorption , and assimilation may also be diminished by disturbances in the production of bile acids and digestive enzymes. Small bowel dilation , dysmotility , loss of ileocecal valve , and anatomical changes combined with acid suppression and antimotility drugs increase the risk of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth , further contributing to malabsorption. Metabolic changes that occur in SBS due to loss of colonic regulation of gastric and small bowel function can also lead to depletion of calcium , magnesium , and vitamin D , resulting in demineralization of bone and the eventual development of bone disease. Persistent inflammation<symptom> , steroid use , parenteral nutrition , chronic metabolic acidosis , and renal insufficiency may exacerbate the problem and contribute to the development of osteoporosis. Multiple factors increase the risk of nephrolithiasis in SBS. In the setting of fat malabsorption , increased free fatty acids are available to bind to calcium , resulting in an increased concentration of unbound oxalate , which is readily absorbed across the colonic mucosa where it travels to the kidney. In addition , there is an increase in colonic permeability to oxalate stemming from the effects of unabsorbed bile salts. The risk of nephrolithiasis is compounded by volume depletion , metabolic acidosis , and hypomagnesemia , resulting in a decrease in renal perfusion , urine output , pH , and citrate excretion. This review examines the causes and treatments of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth , bone demineralization , and nephrolithiasis in SBS.
