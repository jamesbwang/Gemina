 This study aimed to evaluate the dentofacial characteristics and need for orthodontic treatment in young girls having precocious puberty ( PP). It was a cross-sectional study that included 39 girls , age ranging from 6 to 11 years old , with confirmed diagnosis of PP. The Dental Aesthetic Index ( DAI) and the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need ( IOTN) were used to assess malocclusion and the need for orthodontic treatment , and cephalometric analysis was used for the diagnosis of facial growth abnormalities. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and one-sample t-test. Findings revealed high prevalence ( 64.1 %) of severe and very severe malocclusion ( DAI grades 3-4) , and 82.1 % of cases were classified as having moderate<symptom> to high treatment need ( IOTN grades 3-4). All linear cephalometric measures and most of the angular parameters differed significantly from the reference values , indicating a tendency for Class II molar relationship. There was a high proportion of the sample outside the reference value limits , ranging from 79.5 % of cases below the reference limits for facial height to 59.0 % of cases above the limits for incisor-mandibular plane angle. Results suggest that dental and craniofacial development may be associated with PP in young girls , which may be considered in the diagnosis and treatment decisions for orthopaedic/orthodontic intervention.
