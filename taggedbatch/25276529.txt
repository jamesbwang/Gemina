 Community health workers ( CHWs) have been placed in many rural areas in India to increase villagers ' connections to basic preventive health care. In this study , we describe how pregnant women and mothers of young children react when CHWs inform them that they , or their child , are at high risk of pregnancy-related complications or early childhood developmental delays , and further screening and health care from a physician is recommended. In this longitudinal study in rural villages in West Bengal , India , pregnant mothers , as well as mothers of children aged 12-24 months , were screened for high risk complications. They were re-contacted and asked questions regarding how and to what extent did visits by the CHWs improve their household 's overall health behavior , along with details about what additional care , if any , they sought. These responses are presented by different demographic and medical characteristics. Of the 231 pregnant women , all said they had sought additional care in response to the CHW visit , and all stated that feedback from the CHW resulted in improvement to their health behaviors. Most ( 90 %) pregnant women gave birth at an institution. Among the 213 mothers of young children who were followed up , all sought additional care in response to the CHW 's visit. Most ( 67 %) mentioned that they had a significant improvement in their health behaviors following feedback from the CHW , and the rest stated that they had some improvement. With the proper training , CHWs can be partners in health care to improve the health of vulnerable populations , not only in rural areas of India , but also in other developing countries. CHWs can promote positive health outcomes in their villages of residence.
