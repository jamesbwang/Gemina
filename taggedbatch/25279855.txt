 Multi-problem young adults ( 18-27 years) present with a plethora of problems , including varying degrees of psychopathic traits. The amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC) have been implicated in moral dysfunction in psychopathy in adolescents and adults , but no studies have been performed in populations in the transitional period to adulthood. We tested in multi-problem young adults the hypothesis that psychopathic traits are related to amygdala and vmPFC activity during moral evaluation. Additionally , we explored the relation between psychopathic traits and other regions consistently implicated in moral evaluation. Our final sample consisted of 100 multi-problem young adults and 22 healthy controls. During fMRI scanning , participants judged whether pictures showed a moral violation on a 1-4 scale. Whole brain analysis revealed neural correlates of moral evaluation consistent with the literature. Region of interest analyses revealed positive associations between the affective callous-unemotional dimension of psychopathy and activation in the left vmPFC , left superior temporal gyrus , and left cingulate. Our results are consistent with altered vmPFC function during moral evaluation in psychopathy , but we did not find evidence for amygdala involvement. Our findings indicate the affective callous-unemotional trait of psychopathy may be related to widespread altered activation patterns during moral evaluation in multi-problem young adults.
