 Impact of assisted vacations on female caregivers ' burden Abstract. In everyday life , female caregivers experience various burdens due to their responsibilities and challenges. To relief and regenerate from the stressful daily routine , assisted vacations may be a viable option. Previously , there were no empirical findings available that focus on requirements and expectations of female caregivers. Neither do they provide information about the organisation nor do they provide information about the implementation of assisted vacations. The aim of the study was to collect data concerning the attitudes and expectations of female caregivers about assisted vacations to identify positive effects and elements. Ten problem-centered interviews with female caregivers , a group interview with four staff members of a supplier of assisted vacations , and one expert interview with the management of the supplier were operated. To analyse the gathered data the qualitative content analysis by 13-2Gl√§ser & Laudel was conducted ( 2010). A specific anamnesis beforehand the assisted vacations , a continuous development of trust and relationships as well as a professional proactive support and take-over of nursing activities can help female caregivers to enjoy restful and relieving holidays. Six identified conditions contribute to experience a recreative assisted vacation. Staff members who accompany assisted vacations get lots of information about family caregivers. This could be used for ongoing support of family caregivers after the assisted vacations to reduce their burden.
