 The objectives of this study were to: ( a) genotypically characterize Streptococcus<pathogen> agalactiae<pathogen> isolates recovered from clinical mastitis<symptom> ( CM) cases in dairy cows and , ( b) determine the association of antimicrobial susceptibility ( AMS) and genotypes of Strep. agalactiae clustered according to the genetic similarity. A total of 89 Strep. agalactiae<pathogen> isolates recovered from bovine CM were genotyped using random amplified polymorphic DNA ( RAPD) analysis. In addition , the AMS of the isolates was determined using a commercial broth microdilution test composed of 10 antimicrobials ( penicillin , ampicillin , oxacillin , cephalothin , ceftiofur , penicillin/novobiocin , erythromycin , pirlimycin , tetracycline , and sulfadimethoxine). Descriptive analysis was used to report the frequency of RAPD-types and genotypic clusters within herd , housing system , season and CM severity scores. The minimal antimicrobial concentrations that inhibited 50 % ( MIC50) and 90 % ( MIC90) of the isolates were calculated and survival analysis was completed to verify the differences of AMS among genotypic clusters. Results of RAPD showed a great genotypic diversity of Strep. agalactiae<pathogen> ( 45 RAPD-types) and three clusters ( Ia , Ib and II) were created based on the genetic similarity among genotypes. After clustering , a high genetic similarity was observed within and between herds. Overall , Strep. agalactiae<pathogen> showed high susceptibility to most antimicrobials , except to tetracycline and erythromycin. Differences in the AMS among clusters were observed for ampicillin , ceftiofur , erythromycin , pirlimycin , sulfadimethoxine and tetracycline. In conclusion , Strep. agalactiae<pathogen> is still highly susceptible to most antimicrobials , although differences in susceptibility to certain antimicrobials were observed among genotypic clusters.
