 Endometrioid carcinoma is known for its diverse morphology and may pose a diagnostic dilemma when it presents with a spindle cell component. We present a case of a 65-year-old woman with postmenopausal bleeding. Physical examination showed a mass protruding from the external cervical os. The patient underwent biopsy followed by hysterectomy. Pathologic examination showed an endometrioid endometrial carcinoma with spindle cell differentiation arising in an endometrial polyp , which raised a variety of differential diagnoses. Prior reports of this tumor type showed nonaberrant immunohistochemical expression of p16 and p53. However , this case showed p16 and p53 overexpression indicating that there is a spectrum of these tumors.
