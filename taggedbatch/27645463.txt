 The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy , safety and tolerability of local treatment of liver metastases of various types of cancer using brachytherapy with computed tomography ( CT) imaging. Retrospective analysis of 61 patients with unresectable hepatic metastases treated with CT-guided interstitial high dose rate ( HDR) brachytherapy of the liver between April 2014 and December 2016 was performed. Patients were treated with a single fractional dose of 15-25 Gy. Statistical analysis was performed on local relapse free survival ( LRFS) , progression free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) rates across the group. In the 6 and 12-month follow-up periods , the 6- and 12-month LRFS rates were 88.7 and 70.7 % , PFS rates were 78.1 and 53.8 % and the OS rates were 96.7 and 79.6 % , respectively. In the Cox regression analysis , the 100 % isodose was a statistically significant predictor of LRFS ( P = 0.01) and PFS ( P = 0.02) , but it was not significant in OS ( P = 0.07). The 90 % isodose was a statistically significant predictor of LRFS ( P = 0,03) but not significant in PFS ( P = 0.17) or OS ( P = 0.25). In all patients , no serious complications were observed. Overall , 30 % of patients experienced pain at the injection site , and 50 % exhibited nausea<symptom> or vomiting<symptom>. In 2 patients , minor subcapsular bleeding occurred without clinical significance , and 1 patient was diagnosed with a pneumothorax that was not clinically significant. Brachytherapy HDR with CT imaging is an effective and safe method of local treatment of liver metastases. The effectiveness of the treatment is probably dose-dependent , and increases with increasing dosage.
