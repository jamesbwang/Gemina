 To identify the Nursing Diagnoses of incarcerated nursing mothers by the NANDA-I Taxonomy II. Descriptive/exploratory study developed in the Women 's Penal Colony , Recife , PE. The sample consisted of 18 women who were breastfeeding during the study period. A total of 17 diagnoses were listed , whose accuracy was classified as moderate and high by the Nursing Diagnoses Accuracy Scale ( EADE , version 2). Five of these diagnoses were selected for discussion , regarding frequency , magnitude , and impact on the health and well-being of nursing mothers participating in the study. The Nursing Diagnoses identified in this study are not exclusive to nursing mothers who are incarcerated. Some factors relevant to the prison environment may aggravate their problems , which reveal situations of health vulnerability and rights violation. These situations require changes that may respond to the health needs of this target population.
