 Intrapleural hyperthermic chemotherapy ( IPHC) is the preferred method to locally treat lung cancer with pleural seeding. Anesthetic management during IPHC is a very challenging task for the anesthesiologist because of the hemodynamic<symptom> instability<symptom> associated with the procedure; however , there is no report on anesthetic considerations during the IPHC procedure. Three patients who diagnosed lung cancer with pleural invasion scheduled for IPHC were reported in this case series. Case 1 , a 48-year-old woman , suffered from lung cancer ( adenocarcinoma , T2NxM1a) with diffuse pleural seeding. Case 2 , a 58-year-old female , diagnosed with lung cancer ( adenocarcinoma , T3N0M1a) with pleural dissemination. Case 3 , a 47-year-old male , diagnosed as sarcoma<disease> on the left lung with right pericardial invasion and right hemidiaphragm invasion ( stage , T3N0M1a). All three patients underwent IPHC with cisplatin diluted in normal saline ( 2000 ml) at a rate of 600 ml/min. Inflow temperature of 42 Â°C was using a heart-lung machine over 90 minutes. Hemodynamic changes were monitored through the procedure. The patient did not require supplemental oxygenation anymore after he recovered from lung transplantation. There was sudden drop in the cardiac output and an increase in the pulmonary<disease> vascular resistance , which were caused by the volume and temperature of the hyperthermic chemotherapeutic drugs in the pleura during the early stage of IPHC; these changes can be a major problem during the procedure , and supportive hemodynamic management may be needed.
