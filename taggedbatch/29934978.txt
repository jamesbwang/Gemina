 Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results Cancer Registries ( SEER) began collecting human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) status for upper aerodigestive tract cancers in 2010. However , classification of p16-testing was not included in the Collaborative Stage coding guidelines , potentially leading to inconsistent coding. The HPV<pathogen> values for Iowa patients with oropharyngeal<disease> cancers ( n = 824) were recoded based on modified guidelines that included p16 test results , and compared with the original guidelines. Forty percent of patients were recoded to a different value , and the HPV<pathogen> testing rate increased from 45 % to 55 %; 56 % received p16-testing only. Of those originally coded as HPV-type 16 ( n = 187) , 89 % were recoded to HPV-not otherwise specified ( NOS). When comparing high-level positive/negative/not done categories , original coding captured 81 % of patients with HPV-positive cancers. p16 was the most common HPV<pathogen> test but was inconsistently coded as HPV-testing. p16-positivity was also erroneously equated with HPV-type 16. Adding a separate p16 variable would improve consistency and accuracy of HPV<pathogen> coding.
