 A simplified origami strategy to create large-scale complex DNA nanostructures based on the rolling circle amplification ( RCA) is developed. The long repetitive block single strand DNA ( ssDNA<pathogen>) synthesized from RCA with a few staple strands are used to fabricate DNA origami , which can be assembled into the first level assemblies of micro-scale length mono-nanoladders. Depending on base pairing among the sticky ends of short staple strands in nanoladders , the second level assemblies with large-scale and controlled structures such as tri-nanoladder , penta-nanoladder , and even nanobrocade , can be further achieved.
