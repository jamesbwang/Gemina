 The enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase , a target to fight Shigellosis<disease> , recognizes tRNA only as a homodimer and performs full nucleobase exchange at the wobble position. Active-site inhibitors block the enzyme function by competitively replacing tRNA. In solution , the wild-type homodimer dissociates only marginally , whereas mutated variants show substantial monomerization in solution. Surprisingly , one inhibitor transforms the protein into a twisted state , whereby one monomer unit rotates by approximately 130 Â°. In this altered geometry , the enzyme is no longer capable of binding and processing tRNA. Three sugar-type inhibitors have been designed and synthesized , which bind to the protein in either the functionally competent or twisted inactive state. They crystallize with the enzyme side-by-side under identical conditions from the same crystallization well. Possibly , the twisted inactive form corresponds to a resting state of the enzyme , important for its functional regulation.
