 We are currently witnessing a constant and ongoing change of the epidemiological pictures of yeast resistance to antifungal agents , related to the type of host , etiology of the disease , the microorganism involved , and its mechanisms of resistance. This epidemiological situation complicates management of patients with infections of the bloodstream due to species of the genus Candida , exhibiting a high mortality and an increase in the use of anti-fungal agents , as well as the need to develop reliable methods to conduct sensitivity studies. Therefore , local and regional monitoring is important in order to know the sensitivity profile and the distribution of Candida<pathogen> species so as to start an adequate anti-fungal therapy.
