 Iron and molybdenum complexes supported by a pincer-type dianionic ( NS2) 2- donor were prepared to compare their structural , spectroscopic , and electrochemical properties. The versatility of the ( NS2) 2Mo ( iv) complex<pathogen> ( 2) to access different oxidation states was evidenced in the activation of methanol and isopropanol , oxidising them to formaldehyde or acetone with concomitant reduction and protonation to afford ( NHS2) 2Mo ( ii) , complex ( 3). This redox behaviour contrasts with the null reactivity observed for the analogous ferric complex ( NS2) ( NHS2) Fe ( iii) ( 1). Complex 2 presents a quasi-reversible process at E1/2 = -0.80 V relative to the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple ( Fc +/ Fc) , which is attributed to the Mo ( iv)/ Mo ( v) redox couple. Two irreversible cathodic processes were observed at Ecp = -1.59 and -2.20 V , which are attributed to the Mo ( iv)/ Mo ( iii) and Mo ( iii)/ Mo ( ii) redox couples. Cyclic voltammetry and solid-state structures obtained by X-ray crystallography support a 2H + and 2e- process , whereby the Mo ( iv) centre in 2 is reduced sequentially to Mo ( iii) , and finally to Mo ( ii) in 3. These redox events were observed at Ecp = -1.22 and -2.15 V ( vs. Fc +/ Fc) in the anodic cyclic voltammograms of 2 in THF in the presence of acid. A new reduction peak was detected under these conditions at Ecp = -2.30 V , consistent with electrocatalytic proton reduction. This was corroborated for 2 as a catalyst precursor in the presence of increasing amounts of p-toluenesulfonic acid , with the addition of 2 to 14 equivs resulting in an increase of the current measured.
