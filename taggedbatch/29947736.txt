 The majority of leisure-time is spent in sedentary behaviors such as television viewing. Studies have documented that prolonged leisure-time sitting is associated with higher risk of total , cardiovascular disease , cancer , and `` all other causes '' of mortality , but few have examined the `` other '' causes of death in detail. To examine associations of leisure-time sitting with risk of specific causes of death , data were analyzed from the CPS-II Nutrition Cohort , a prospective U.S. cohort including 127,554 men and women who were free of major chronic<disease> disease<disease> at study entry and among whom 48,784 died during 21 years of follow-up ( 1993-2014; median = 20.3 years , IQR = 4.6 years). After multivariable adjustment , prolonged leisure-time sitting ( 6 + vs < 3 hours/day) was associated with higher risk of all-cause , cardiovascular disease ( including coronary heart disease and stroke-specific mortality) , cancer , diabetes , kidney disease , suicide , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pneumonitis<disease><symptom> due to solids and liquids , liver and other digestive disease , Parkinson 's disease , Alzheimer 's disease , nervous disorders , and musculoskeletal disorders mortality. These findings provide additional evidence for associations between a broad range of mortality outcomes and prolonged sitting time. Given the pervasive nature of sitting in contemporary lifestyle , this study further supports that encouraging individuals to reduce sedentary time may provide health benefits.
