 Endovascular strategies have been increasingly used for the treatment of chronic type B aortic dissection ( cTBAD) offering better outcomes in terms of mortality and morbidity compared to open surgical repair. 1 , 2 Aortic remodeling after standard TEVAR is less likely in cTBAD due to rigidity of the dissection membrane .3 Another limition of endovascular therapy is continued retrograde false lumen perfusion with back-flow from distal entry tears .4 Treatment strategies in cTBAD should aim at false lumen thrombosis. There are many approaches to achieve this goal of false lumen thrombosis , but concepts as open surgery or fenestrated and branched endovascular repair are limited by either high technical and logistic demands to the surgeon or high rates of mortality and morbidity. 5 , 6 False lumen embolization techniques offer less invasive treatment strategies with promising early results. The main strategies for false lumen embolization include the `` cork in the bottle neck '' Technique , the Candy-Plug Technique or the Knickerbocker-Technique. This article describes technical aspects and early results of these new endovascular techniques of false lumen embolisation in chronic aortic dissection.
