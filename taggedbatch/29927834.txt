 Propranolol ( PRO) is the first-line drug for infantile hemangioma treatment. However , its mechanism of action remains unclear. Nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB) is highly expressed in tumors , directly or indirectly promoting angiogenesis. Thrombospondin-1 ( TSP-1) is the most important anti-angiogenesis protein in vivo. These proteins mediate signaling pathways , probably playing an important role in hemangioma treatment. This study explored the synergistic regulation of TSP-1 and NF-κB signaling pathways in the treatment of hemangioma with PRO. The hemangioma-derived endothelial cells ( HemECs) were sorted out from the specimens of proliferative hemangioma by flow cytometry. Furthermore , a BALB/c nude mice hemangioma model was established. Viability and proliferation of HemECs , and the role of TSP-1 and NF-κB signaling pathways were observed after PRO administration in vitro and in vivo. The expressions of TSP-1 and its receptor cluster of differentiation 36 ( CD36) in HemECs gradually increased with the increase in PRO concentration , while the expressions of NF-κBp65 , phosphorylated inhibitor of kappa B alpha ( p-IκBα) , and phosphorylated inhibitor of NF-κB kinase beta ( p-IκKβ) weakened gradually ( p < 0.05). In vivo , the tumors shrank gradually after PRO treatment , with increase in TSP-1 and CD36 , and decrease in NF-κBp65 , p-IκBα , and p-IκKβ ( p < 0.05). Glucocorticoid improved the anti-angiogenesis mediated by TSP-1/ CD36 and inhibited the angiogenesis mediated by NF-κB/IκB ( p < 0.05). Negative regulation occurred between the two signaling pathways. The treatment of infantile hemangioma with PRO is promising to promote TSP-1-mediated anti-angiogenesis and block NF-κB-mediated angiogenesis.
