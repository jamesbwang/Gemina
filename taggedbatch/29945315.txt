 Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , and both coronary artery disease ( CAD) and diabetes mellitus are associated with inflammation<symptom>. Emerging evidence suggests a relationship of the monocyte to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio ( MHR) with the incidence and severity of CAD. The aim of the present study was to examine the association of MHR with CAD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 458 consecutive individuals were enrolled , comprising 178 type 2 diabetic patients , 124 type 2 diabetes with CAD , and 156 healthy volunteers as the controls. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between the MHR and CAD in type 2 diabetes , and the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve of MHR was used for predicting the presence of CAD in type 2 diabetic patients. Values of MHR were significantly higher in type 2 diabetic patients with CAD compared with those without CAD and the control group. Moreover , multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that MHR was an independent predictor of the presence of CAD in type 2 diabetic patients ( OR = 1.361 , 95 % CI 1.245- 1.487 , p < 0.0001). Based on the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve , the cutoff value of MHR ( > 8.2) in predicting the presence of CAD in type 2 diabetic patients yields a sensitivity and specificity of 83.74 % and 62.15 % , respectively , with an area under the curve of 0.795 ( 95 % CI: 0.745- 0.840). The MHR is strongly associated with CAD in type 2 diabetes and might be a potential biomarker to predict the presence of CAD in type 2 diabetic patients.
