 The quality of RNA sequencing data relies on specific priming by the primer used for reverse transcription ( RT-primer). Non-specific annealing of the RT-primer to the RNA template can generate reads with incorrect cDNA ends and can cause misinterpretation of data ( RT mispriming). This kind of artifact in RNA-seq based technologies is underappreciated and currently no adequate tools exist to computationally remove them from published datasets. We show that mispriming can occur with as little as 2 bases of complementarity at the 3 ' end of the primer followed by intermittent regions of complementarity. We also provide a computational pipeline that identifies cDNA reads produced from RT mispriming , allowing users to filter them out from any aligned dataset. Using this analysis pipeline , we identify thousands of mispriming events in a dozen published datasets from diverse technologies including short RNA-seq , total/mRNA-seq , HITS-CLIP and GRO-seq. We further show how RT mispriming can lead to misinterpretation of data. In addition to providing a solution to computationally remove RT-misprimed reads , we also propose an experimental solution to completely avoid RT-mispriming by performing RNA-seq using thermostable group II intron derived reverse transcriptase ( TGIRT-seq).
