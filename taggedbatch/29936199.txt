 Aim of this study is to report and to analyze the incidence , clinical impact and treatment options of ectopic air localizations after transanal procedures. A systematic literature review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA) guidelines. The research was carried out using the PubMed database , identifying 40 articles with the following keywords: `` transanal '' AND `` emphysema ''; `` transanal '' AND `` subcutaneous emphysema ''; `` transanal '' AND `` pneumomediastinum ''; `` transanal '' AND `` pneumothoraces ''; `` transanal '' AND `` pneumopericardium ''; `` transanal '' AND `` retropneumoperitoneum ''. Nineteen articles , published between 1993 and 2017 , were included in the study for a total of 29 patients. The most frequent air localization was in the retroperitoneum , followed by subcutaneous tissues , mediastinum and neck. This condition was treated conservatively in 20 patients , with colostomy in 4 patients , with bowel resection and negative diagnostic laparoscopy in one patient each. In three cases the treatment was not specified. Ectopic air location resolved in all cases. Pneumo-mediastinum and pneumo-retroperitoneum after transanal procedures are unusual complications with a dramatic radiological appearance but can be managed successfully with a completely benign course in most cases. Initially , a conservative approach is recommended. Surgical treatment should be reserved only in case of fluid collection or suture dehiscence.
