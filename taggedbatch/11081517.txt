 Epigenetics defines the persistent modifications of gene expression in a manner that does not involve the corresponding alterations in DNA sequences. It includes modifications of DNA nucleotides , nucleosomal remodeling , and post-translational modifications ( PTMs). It is becoming evident that PTMs which act singly or in combination to form `` histone codes '' orchestrate the chromatin structure and dynamic functions. PTMs of histone tails have been demonstrated to influence numerous biological developments , as well as disease onset and progression. Multiple sclerosis ( MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system , of which the precise pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. There is a wealth of emerging evidence that epigenetic modifications may confer risk for MS , which provides new insights into MS. Histone PTMs , one of the key events that regulate gene activation , seem to play a prominent role in the epigenetic mechanism of MS. In this review , we summarize recent studies in our understanding of the epigenetic language encompassing histone , with special emphasis on histone acetylation and histone lysine methylation , two of the best characterized histone modifications. We also discuss how the current studies address histone acetylation and histone lysine methylation influencing pathophysiology of MS and how future studies could be designed to establish optimized therapeutic strategies for MS.
