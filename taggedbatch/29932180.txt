 We present molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous iron ( ii) systems in the presence of polyacrylic acid ( PAA) under the extreme conditions that take place in the secondary coolant circuit of a nuclear power plant. The aim of this work is to understand how the oligomer can prevent iron ( ii) deposits , and to provide molecular interpretation. We show how , to this end , not only the complexant ability is necessary , but also the chain length compared to iron ( ii) concentration. When the chain is long enough , a hyper-complexation phenomenon occurs that can explain the specific capacity of the polymer to prevent iron ( ii) precipitation.
