 The aim of the present study was to formulate a nanosuspension ( FA-NS) of fusidic acid ( FA) to enhance its aqueous solubility and antibacterial activity. The nanosuspension was characterized using various in vitro , in silico , and in vivo techniques. The size , polydispersity index , and zeta potential of the optimized FA-NS were 265 ± 2.25 nm , 0.158 ± 0.026 , and -16.9 ± 0.794 mV , respectively. The molecular dynamics simulation of FA and Poloxamer-188 showed an interaction and binding energy of -74.42 kJ/mol and -49.764 ± 1.298 kJ/mol , respectively , with van der Waals interactions playing a major role in the spontaneous binding. There was an 8-fold increase in the solubility of FA in a nanosuspension compared to the bare drug. The MTT assays showed a cell viability of 75-100 % confirming the nontoxic nature of FA-NS. In vitro antibacterial activity revealed a 16- and 18-fold enhanced activity against Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( SA) and methicillin-resistant SA ( MRSA) , respectively , when compared to bare FA. Flowcytometry showed that MRSA cells treated with FA-NS had almost twice the percentage of dead bacteria in the population , despite having an 8-fold lower MIC in comparison to the bare drug. The in vivo skin-infected mice showed a 76-fold reduction in the MRSA load for the FA-NS treated group compared to that of the bare FA. These results show that the nanosuspension of antibiotics can enhance their solubility and antibacterial activity simultaneously.
