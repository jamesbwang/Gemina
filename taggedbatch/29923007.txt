 We studied the effects of social isolation for 1 , 2 or 3 weeks on behavioral reactions of male rats. As social isolation is a common model for inducing depressive-like state in rodents , classical tests for depressive-like behavioral features were conducted: Porsolt forced swimming test and tests for anhedonia and social interest. None of the experimental groups showed statistically significant disorders in comparison with the control group kept under standard conditions. Thus , social isolation for up to 3 weeks did not cause behavioral abnormalities in male rats. Single housing can be used in other models of induction of depressive-like states , but the use of this paradigm as an independent model for the development of depressive-like behavior requires longer period of social isolation.
