 This study examined the associations between sleep and challenging behaviors for average and night-to-night fluctuations in sleep , in 39 children with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) receiving intensive behavioral intervention ( IBI). Child sleep was recorded ( via actigraphy) for five nights<symptom> in conjunction with clinician-reported observations of challenging behaviors. Results indicated that on average , poor sleep was associated with higher rates of repetitive behavior , negative affect , and a composite of overall challenging behaviors. These findings suggest that average sleep patterns are important within the context of IBI ( rather than night-to-night fluctuations). Interventions aimed at improving overall patterns of sleep may have important cascading effects on challenging behaviors and developmental outcomes for children with ASD and their families.
