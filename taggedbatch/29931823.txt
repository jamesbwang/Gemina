 Diabetes ( DM) as well as obesity , due to their increasing incidence , were recognized as epidemic by the World Health Organization. Obesity is involved not only in the aetiopathogenesis of the most common worldwide type of DM-type 2 diabetes-but also in the development of its complications. There is also increasing scientific evidence regarding the role of obesity and overweight in type 1 diabetes. Weight gain may be considered as a complication of insulin treatment but also reveals significant pathophysiological impact on various stages of the disease. Another very important aspect related to DM as well as obesity is the microbiome , which is highly variable. The function of the gut microflora , its interaction with the whole organism , and its role in the development of obesity and type 1 diabetes as well as type 2 diabetes are still not fully understood and subject of ongoing investigations. This review presents a summary of recently published results concerning the relation of obesity/overweight and DM as well as their associations with the microbiome.
