 Single ventricle ( SV) patients with total anomalous pulmonary venous connection ( TAPVC) are at high risk. Given the limited published data available , we examined outcomes and the implications of a prenatal diagnosis of SV/TAPVC. A single-center , retrospective review was performed in neonates with SV/TAPVC from 1998 to 2014 , identified through institutional databases. Patient demographic , perioperative , and follow-up data were collected. Thirty-four eligible infants with SV/TAPVC were identified ( mean birth weight: 3.0 kg). The TAPVC types were supracardiac ( 59 %) , infracardiac ( 21 %) , mixed ( 12 %) , and cardiac ( 9 %). Heterotaxy syndrome<disease><symptom> was present in 25 ( 74 %) infants. A prenatal diagnosis of SV was made in 26 ( 76 %) infants , with TAPVC identified in 12 ( 35 %). Seventeen ( 50 %) had obstructed TAPVC within the first 48 hours of life; 7 of these patients had obstructed TAPVC identified prenatally. There were two preoperative deaths. Overall survival for the cohort was 65 % at 1 year and 50 % at 3 years. Survival in the obstructed group was significantly worse compared to the unobstructed group ( 47 % vs 81 % at 1 year; 27 % vs 73 % at 3 years , P = .01). Obstructed TAPVC and a prenatal prediction of obstructed TAPVC were significantly associated with postoperative mortality ( P = .01 and .03 , respectively). Patients with SV/TAPVC remain a high-risk group , with obstructed TAPVC a significant risk factor for mortality. Prenatal diagnosis of TAPVC in SV patients is challenging , but given those with obstructed TAPVC are especially at high risk , improved prenatal diagnostic techniques in this group may enhance counseling/delivery planning.
