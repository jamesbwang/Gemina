 Unfolded protein response ( UPR) is a cytoprotective mechanism that alleviates the protein-folding burden in eukaryotic organisms. Moderate activation of UPR is required for maintaining endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) homeostasis and profoundly contributes to tumorigenesis. Defects in UPR signaling are implicated in the attenuation of various malignant phenotypes including cell proliferation , migration , and invasion , as well as angiogenesis. This suggests UPR as a promising target in cancer therapy. The pharmacological effects of the plant
