 Sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( sALS) is characterized pathologically by loss of upper and lower motor neurons with occurrence of transactivation response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa ( TDP-43)- immunoreactive skein-like and round hyaline inclusions<disease>. Lewy body-like hyaline inclusions<disease> ( LBHIs) are also found in a small proportion of sALS cases as well as in individuals with familial ALS with mutations in the Cu/Zu superoxide dismutase ( SOD1) gene. LBHIs in sALS are immunopositive for TDP-43 , but not for SOD1. The occurrence of Bunina bodies ( BBs) is another key pathological feature of sALS. BBs are immunonegative for TDP-43 but immunopositive for cystatin C , transferrin , peripherin and sortilin-related receptor CNS expressed 2 ( SorCS2). Despite differences between BBs and TDP-43 inclusions<disease> in terms of protein constituents and ultrastructure , the two inclusions<disease> are known to be linked. We recently encountered a case of sALS of 10 months duration in which many round hyaline inclusions<disease> , LBHIs and BBs were found in the anterior horn cells of the spinal<disease> cord. Our immunohistochemical and ultrastructural examinations revealed the presence of BBs within the skein-like and round hyaline inclusions<disease> , and in the LBHIs. Colocalization of BB-related proteins ( cystatin C , transferrin and SorCS2) and TDP-43 was also confirmed in the halo of LBHIs as well as in the marginal portion of the skein-like and round hyaline inclusions<disease>. These findings suggest that there is some relationship between BBs and TDP-43-immunoreactive inclusions<disease> in terms of their formation processes.
