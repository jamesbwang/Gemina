 A novel sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone rapidly-dissolving tablet ( BNX-RDT) for opioid substitution therapy has been developed for improved bioavailability , rapid disintegration and improved taste masking. We compared the bioavailability and pharmaceutical properties of BNX-RDT with conventional buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets ( BNX). Fasting , open-label , randomized , single-dose , two-cohort crossover study in healthy volunteers under naltrexone block. Cohort 1 ( high-dose , N = 64) received BNX-RDT 11.4/ 2.9 mg and BNX 16/4 mg. Cohort 2 ( low-dose , N = 61) received BNX-RDT 2.9/ 0.71 mg and BNX 4/1 mg. Plasma samples were collected over 72 h. Relative systemic exposures of buprenorphine and naloxone were assessed using standard statistical models for bioequivalence analysis. Pharmaceutical assessments included dissolve time , taste and mouthfeel assessments , and overall preference. BNX-RDT 11.4/ 2.9 mg provided equivalent buprenorphine and naloxone exposure to BNX 16/4 mg. BNX-RDT 2.9/ 0.71 mg provided ~ 20 % lower buprenorphine and 35 % lower naloxone exposure compared with BNX 4/1 mg. The comparison of BNX-RDT 2.9/ 0.71 mg with BNX 4/1 mg did not fully meet equivalence criteria. BNX-RDT was associated with improved dose proportionality across strengths compared with BNX ( post hoc analysis) , resulting in lower exposure from BNX-RDT relative to BNX at the lower strength. Median perceived dissolve times were significantly shorter for BNX-RDT than BNX at high ( 8.5 versus 16.2 min) and low ( 7.6 versus 9.1 min) doses. Taste and mouthfeel were rated significantly more pleasant than BNX , with ~ 78 % of subjects preferring BNX-RDT. BNX-RDT provided improved buprenorphine absorption compared to a conventional sublingual tablet , with shorter dissolve times and improved taste and mouthfeel , resulting in a high preference for the novel formulation.
