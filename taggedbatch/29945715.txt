 The retrocession ( out-patient dispensing of hospital-reserved drugs) is a pharmaceutical critical activity requiring a care security with a territorial approach. In this drug supply chain , the pharmacist is the last step before the drug administration and the economic profitability is questionable. In this context , a risk mapping and an economic evaluation seem necessary. The risk analysis was conducted with the adverse events collected. The economic study was realised with the point of view of the hospital and with the microcosting method. Six never events were observed with the risk analysis. The economic study showed that the retrocession was profitable in usual situations with a net margin from 7 to 14 $. But , when an exceptional situation occurred as a troubleshooting or the creation of a public deal , the added costs became so important ( 76 and 85 $) that the retrocession was an unbeneficial activity. The retrocession is an activity with a health , legal and economic high risk. In order to improve the healthcare quality and safety , the retrocession must be considered as a coordinated process. It means that the different health professionals must communicate with each other and that the connection between the ambulatory and the hospital care must be efficient.
