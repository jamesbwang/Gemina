 Calycanthaceae family comprises of four genera including Chimonanthus , Sinocalycanthus , Calycanthus , and Idiospermum. The plants of Calycanthaceae are popular ornamental shrubs and used as foods and medicines , which are mainly distributed in China , North<pathogen> America , and Australia. The plants of Calycanthaceae are rich in volatile components , alkaloids , sesquiterpenes and coumarins. Dimeric piperidinoquinoline and dimeric pyrrolidinoindoline alkaloids , dimeric and/or trimeric coumarins are characteristic compositions in these plants. In order to provide timely reference for further investigation and development of Calycanthaceae plants , we made a systemic review on chemical constituents , i.e. alkaloids , terpenoids , flavonoids , coumarins , and steroids , from Calycanthaceae plants , focusing on their chemical structures and pharmacological activities.
