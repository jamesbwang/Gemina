 αE-catenin is a component of adherens junctions that link the cadherin-catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton. The signaling function of this protein was recently revealed. In the present study , we investigated the role of αE-catenin in the pathogenesis of heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. We mated αE-catenin conditional knockout mice with αMHC-Cre mice and evaluated their mutant offspring. We found that αE-catenin knockout caused enlargement of the heart and atria , fibrosis<disease> , the upregulation of hypertrophic genes , and the dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism via the transcriptional activity of Yap and β-catenin. The activation of canonical Wnt and Yap decreased the activity of main regulators of energy metabolism ( i.e. , adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α) and dysregulated hypertrophic pathway activity ( i.e. , phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/Akt , cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A , and MEK1/extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2). The loss of αE-catenin also negatively affected cardio-hemodynamic function via the protein kinase A pathway. Overall , we found that the embryonic heart-specific ablation of αE-catenin leads to the development of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with age and premature death in mice. Thus , αE-catenin appears to have a crucial signaling function in the postnatal heart , and the dysfunction of this gene causes heart<symptom> failure<symptom> through canonical Wnt and Yap activation.
