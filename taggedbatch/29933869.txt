 Metformin ( MET) has possibilities to be utilized as an adjunct of tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) therapy for controlling the growth of Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> ( M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease>). MET enhances the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and facilitates phagosome-lysosome fusion; those mechanism are important in M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> elimination. Moreover , MET-associated lactic acidosis ( MALA) needs to be considered and the incidence of MALA in patients with type 2 DM-TB coinfection remains unknown. This result contributes much to our understanding about the clinical effect of MET use in type 2 DM-TB coinfection. For the purpose of understanding the MET effect as an adjuvant therapy in TB therapy and insulin simultaneous therapy , an observational clinical study was done in type 2 DM newly TB coinfection outpatients at Surabaya Paru Hospital. Patients were divided into two groups. First group was MET group , in which the patients were given MET accompanying insulin and TB treatment regimens , the golden standard therapy of DM-TB coinfection. MET therapy was given for at least 2 months. Second group was non-MET group , in which the patients were given insulin and TB treatment regimens. The lactate levels in both groups were measured after 2 months. Among 42 participants , there was no case of lactic acidosis during this study period. Data were normally distributed; thus , we continued analysis of the difference using paired T-test with 95 % confidence. There was no difference in lactate levels ( p = 0.396) after MET therapy compared to non-MET group. In this study involving patients with TB pulmonary diseases , there is neither evidence that MET therapy induced lactic acidosis event nor that it increased lactate blood level. Thus , we concluded that MET use in type 2 DM-TB coinfection did not induce lactic acidosis.
