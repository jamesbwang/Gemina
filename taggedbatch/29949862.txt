 Vaccinology faces the challenge of developing improved immunization approaches that are able to induce long-term immunity with the desired Th profile according to the pathology. In this context , new vehicles for efficient antigen delivery that exert adjuvant effects play a critical role in addressing this goal. Herein , mesoporous silicon particles ( PSiP) were assessed as carriers for a peptide-based vaccine targeting the receptor for advanced glycation end products ( RAGE) , which is a relevant receptor in Alzheimer & acute; s disease and other diseases. A RAGE peptide was adsorbed onto PSiP ( PSiP vaccine) and administered to BALB/c mice , leading to immune responses that were similar in magnitude to those induced by the soluble peptide. However , the response induced by PSiP lasted for a significantly longer period when compared with the behavior of the group immunized with the peptide alone. Therefore , PSiP are proposed as carriers to enhance immune memory , which is critical in vaccination. This study opens interesting perspectives related to the application of PSiP in vaccinology.
