 Chronic inflammation<symptom> caused by HIV<pathogen> infection may lead to deficient glucocorticoid ( GC) signaling predisposing people living with HIV<pathogen> to depression<symptom> and other psychiatric disorders linked to GC resistance. We hypothesized that comorbid HIV<pathogen> and depressive symptoms in women would synergistically associate with deficits in GC signaling. This cross-sectional study used samples obtained from the Women 's Interagency HIV<pathogen> Study ( WIHS). The Centers for Epidemiological Studies ( CES-D) was used to define depression<symptom> in four groups of women from the Women 's Interagency HIV<pathogen> Study ( WIHS): 1) HIV-negative , non-depressed ( n = 37); 2) HIV-negative , depressed ( n = 34); 3) HIV-positive , non-depressed ( n = 38); and 4) HIV-positive , depressed ( n = 38). To assess changes in GC signaling from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) , we examined baseline and dexamethasone ( Dex)- stimulated changes in the expression of the GC receptor ( GR , gene: Nr3c1) and its negative regulator Fkbp5 via quantitative RT-PCR. GR sensitivity was evaluated in vitro by assessing the Dex inhibition of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- stimulated IL-6 and TNF-Î± levels. Depressive symptoms and HIV<pathogen> serostatus were independently associated with elevated baseline expression of Fkbp5 and Nr3c1. Depressive symptoms , but not HIV<pathogen> status , was independently associated with reduced LPS-induced release of IL-6. Counter to predictions , there was no interactive association of depressive symptoms and HIV<pathogen> on any outcome. Comorbid depressive symptoms with HIV<pathogen> infection were associated with a gene expression and cytokine profile similar to that of healthy control women , a finding that may indicate further disruptions in disease adaptation.
