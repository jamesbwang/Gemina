 Metal oxide semiconductors with a porous hollow structure have received great attention in many fields. In this work , a facile preparation method of porous tube-like ZnO ( PT-ZnO) was developed by annealing rod-like ZIF-L at high temperature , and the formation mechanism of the tube-like structure was discussed in detail. The corresponding gas sensing performances were determined adopting acetone as the target gas. Gas-sensing test results show that PT-ZnO has better acetone sensing performance than that of porous plate-like ZnO ( PP-ZnO) derived from leaf-like ZIF-L , resulting from the unique tube-like structure and larger amount of adsorbed oxygen. It is found that the introduction of Au nanoparticles greatly improves the acetone sensing performance , which can be attributed to the activation of acetone by Au and the increased amount of adsorbed oxygen. Au/PT-ZnO has the largest amount of adsorbed oxygen which even becomes the dominant oxygen species on the surface of PT-ZnO , resulting in the best acetone-sensing performance.
