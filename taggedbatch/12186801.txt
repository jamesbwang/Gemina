 A 10-month-old infant experienced cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation ( VF). His electrocardiogram ( ECG) at rest was within the normal range. Amiodarone was indispensable due to its refractoriness to defibrillation. After implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD) implantation , ICD shock<symptom> was delivered. ICD recordings documented VF and ventricular tachycardia<symptom> ( VT) triggered by premature ventricular contractions with an extremely short coupling interval ( 240 ms) , which were controlled by verapamil. To the best of our knowledge , our case is the first infant with ScTdP. As the electrical storm with ScTdP occurs unpredictably , it can be a cause of sudden infant death syndrome<disease><symptom>.
