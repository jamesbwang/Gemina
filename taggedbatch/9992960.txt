 A systematic comparative study has been performed to better understand DFT+U ( density functional theory + U) method. We examine the effect of choosing different double counting and exchange-correlation functionals. The calculated energy distribution and the Hund-J dependence of potential profile for representative configurations clearly show the different behaviors of each DFT+U formalism. In particular , adopting spin-dependent exchange-correlation functionals likely leads to undesirable magnetic solution. Our analyses are further highlighted by real material examples ranging from insulating oxides ( MnO and NiO) to metallic magnetic systems ( SrRuO
