 Sequential sampling of evidence , or evidence accumulation , has been implemented in a variety of models to explain a range of multialternative choice phenomena. But the existing models do not agree on what , exactly , the evidence is that is accumulated. They also do not agree on how this evidence is accumulated. In this article , we use findings from process-tracing studies to constrain the evidence accumulation process. With these constraints , we extend the decision by sampling model and propose the multialternative decision by sampling ( MDbS) model. In MDbS , the evidence accumulated is outcomes of pairwise ordinal comparisons between attribute values. MDbS provides a quantitative account of the attraction , compromise , and similarity effects equal to that of other models , and captures a wider range of empirical phenomena than other models.
