 Kidney transplantation is currently the best approach for renal replacement therapy. Compared with dialysis , it provides a better quality of life and improves patient prognosis. However , some evidence suggests that body composition could play a role in the complications observed in kidney transplant recipients ( KTRs) , and may influence survival. The purpose of this study was to assess the eating habits and body composition of KTRs. Seventy KTRs were included in this study. Anthropometry and body composition were performed using electronic-scale , dynamometer , and bioimpedance analyses. Dietary habits were investigated using the Food Frequency Questionnaire ( FFQ6). Biochemical parameters were also determined. Overweight and obesity were found in 33.8 % and 21.1 % of KTRs , respectively. High body mass index ( BMI , > 25) correlated positively with high body fat ( r = 0.8 , P < .05) and waist circumference ( r = 0.7 , P < .05). The mean percentage of body fat was 30.8 ± 9.3 % ( range , 13 % -52 %) , fat tissue index was 12.4 ± 4.9 , and lean tissue index ( LTI) was 13.2 ± 2.2. Sarcopenia was recognized based on decreased LTI and decreased handgrip strength in 33.3 % of KTRs with excess<symptom> body<symptom> weight. Patients with excess<symptom> body mass consumed significantly ( P < .05) more sugar and fruits. A significant percentage of KTRs present with sarcopenic obesity. Excess<symptom> body<symptom> weight is associated with many factors , such as immunosuppressive therapy , low physical activity , and abnormal diet. Results based on the FFQ6 indicate a relationship between carbohydrate intake and excess<symptom> body<symptom> weight among those in the study group.
