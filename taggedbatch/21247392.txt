 Significance of platelet distribution width ( PDW) and mean platelet volume ( MPV) in assessing disease activity of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) remains unclear. This study was aimed to evaluate PDW and MPV as potential disease activity markers in adult SLE patients. A total of 204 study participants , including 91 SLE patients and 113 age- and gender-matched healthy controls , were selected in this cross-sectional study. They were classified into three groups: control group ( In patient group , PDW was statistically higher than that in control group ( 13.54 ± 2.67 vs. 12.65 ± 2.34 , This study first associates a higher PDW level with an increased SLE activity , suggesting PDW as a novel indicator to monitor the activity of SLE.
