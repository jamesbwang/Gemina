 ROS1 gene fusions are a well-characterized class of oncogenic driver found in approximately 1-2 % of non-small cell lung cancer patients. ROS1-directed therapy in these patients is more efficacious and is associated with fewer side effects compared to chemotherapy and is thus now considered standard-of-care for patients with advanced disease. Consequently , accurate detection of ROS1 rearrangements/fusions in clinical tumor samples is vital. In this study , we compared the performance of three common molecular testing approaches on a cohort of ROS1 rearrangement/fusion-positive patient samples. Twenty-three ROS1 rearrangement/fusion-positive clinical samples were assessed by at least two of the following molecular testing methodologies: break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) , DNA-based hybrid capture library preparation followed by next-generation sequencing ( NGS) , and RNA-based anchored multiplex PCR library preparation followed by NGS. None of the testing methodologies demonstrated 100 % sensitivity in detection of ROS1 rearrangements/fusions. FISH results were negative in 2 out of 20 tested samples , the DNA-based NGS assay was negative in 4 out of 18 tested samples , and the RNA-based NGS assay was negative in 3 of 19 tested samples. For all three testing approaches , we identified assay characteristics that likely contributed to false-negative results. Additionally , we report that genomic breakpoints are an unreliable predictor of breakpoints at the transcript level , likely due to alternative splicing. ROS1 rearrangement/fusion detection in the clinical setting is complex and all methodologies have inherent limitations of which users must be aware in order to correctly interpret results.
