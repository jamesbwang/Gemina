 Mammalian immune systems evolved within a diverse world dominated by microbes , making interactions between these two life-forms inevitable. Adaptive immunity protects against microbes through antigen-specific responses. In classical studies , these responses were investigated in the context of pathogenicity; however , we now know that they have significant effects on our resident microbes. In turn , microbes employ an arsenal of mechanisms to influence development and specificity of host immunity. Understanding these complex reactions will be necessary to develop microbiota-based strategies to prevent or treat disease. Here we review the literature detailing the cross talk between resident microbes with a focus on the specificity of the host response and the microbial molecules that influence them. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Microbiology Volume 72 is September 8 , 2018. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.
