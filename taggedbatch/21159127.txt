 Experimental trials were done on five dogs to explore if an anterior abdominal wall defect could be repaired using wet ( 99.9 %) , compact BNC membranes<symptom> produced by the Ðœedusomyces gisevii Sa-12 symbiotic culture. The abdominal wall defect was simulated by middle-midline laparotomy , and a BNC membrane was then fixed to open aponeurotic edges with blanket suture ( Prolene 4-0 , Ethicon). A comparative study was also done to reinforce the aponeurotic defect with both the BNC membrane and polypropylene mesh ( PPM) ( Ultrapro , Ethicon). The materials were harvested at 14 and 60 days postoperative to visually evaluate their location in the abdominal tissues and evaluate the presence of BNC and PPM adhesions to the intestinal loops , followed by histologic examination of the tissue response to these prosthetics. The BNC exhibited good fixation to the anterior abdominal wall to form on the 14th day a capsule of loose fibrin around the BNC. Active reparative processes were observed at the BNC site at 60 days post-surgery to generate new , stable connective-tissue elements ( macrophages , giant cells , fibroblasts , fibrin) and neocapillaries. Negligible intraperitoneal adhesions were detected between the BNC and the intestinal loops as compared to the case of PPM. There were no suppurative complications throughout the postsurgical period.
