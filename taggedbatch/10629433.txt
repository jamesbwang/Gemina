 Electroencephalogram ( EEG) alpha asymmetry ( AA) in depressive disorders has been of interest over the last few decades , but it continues to remain unclear whether EEG AA can discriminate between healthy and depressive individuals. A systematic literature search for papers addressing EEG AA using the keywords alpha asymmetry , depression<symptom> , and EEG was performed in PubMed. All studies were checked for sample size , gender , handedness , reference , recording protocol , EEG band range , impedance , type of analysis , drugs , and comorbidity. A total of 61 articles were found , of which 44 met our inclusion criteria. They have been consecutively analyzed in respect of methodology and results. Approximately 25 % ( 11/44) of the studies did not mention or ignored handedness , 41 % ( 18/44) of the studies used data with only self-reported handedness , and only 34.1 % ( 15/44) of all studies tested handedness. Only 35 % ( 15/44) of the studies reported pharmacological treatment , and only 35 % ( 15/44) of the studies controlled for medication. A total of 52 % ( 23/44) of the studies reported comorbidity , and only 30 % ( 13/44) of the studies controlled for comorbidity. Only 29.6 % ( 13/44) of the studies reported education. In all , 30.5 % ( 13/44) of the studies analyzed group differences and correlations , while 15.9 ( 7/44) of the studies used only correlational analyses. A total of 52.3 % ( 23/44) of the studies analyzed only group differences. Alpha range was fixed ( 8-13 Hz) in 59.1 % ( 26/44) of all studies. Reference to common average was used in seven of 44 studies ( 15.9 %). In all , nine of 44 ( 20.5 %) studies used the midline central position as reference , 22 of 44 ( 50 %) studies used the ear or the mastoid as reference , and four of 44 ( 9.1 %) studies used the nose as reference. Discriminative power of EEG AA for depressed and healthy controls remains unclear. A systematic analysis of 44 studies revealed that differences in methodology and disregarding proper sampling are problematic. Ignoring handedness , gender , age , medication , and comorbidity could explain inconsistent findings. Hence , we formulated a guideline for requirements for future studies on EEG AA in order to allow for better comparisons.
