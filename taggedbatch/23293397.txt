 To examine the relationship between chronic health conditions and out-of-pocket costs ( OOPC) and medical debt. Secondary data from the 2013 Panel Study of Income Dynamics ( PSID) was used. Households whose head of household and spouse ( for married households) were 18 to 64 years old were included. Households with 1 to 3 chronic conditions had higher odds of having any OOPC compared to households with no chronic conditions ( AOR 1.74 , 95 % CI 1.39 , 2.17) ( p < .01). Households with 1 to 3 and 4 or more chronic health conditions were associated with higher odds of having any medical debt ( AOR 2.24 , 95 % CI 1.75 to 2.87; AOR 5.04 , 95 % CI 3.04 to 8.34) compared to those with no chronic conditions ( p < 0.01). Similarly , 1 to 3 and 4 or more chronic health conditions was associated with higher amounts of OOPC ( Exponentiated Coefficient 1.18 , 95 % CI 1.03 to 1.36; Exponentiated Coefficient 1.56 , 95 % CI 1.17 to 2.07) and medical debt ( Exponentiated Coefficient 1.69 , 95 % CI 1.23 to 2.34; Exponentiated Coefficient 2.73 , 95 % CI 1.19 to 6.25) compared to households with no chronic conditions ( p < 0.05). Findings from this study show that the presence of chronic health conditions impose a large financial burden on some households.
