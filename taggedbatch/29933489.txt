 The current mandate for person-centered care throughout the health care system , and especially in the nursing home industry , requires that speech-language pathologists ensure that the services they provide to elders with dementia are skilled , person centered , and relevant to positive overall health outcomes. Guidelines developed by the Association Montessori International Advisory Board for Montessori for Aging and Dementia are one avenue toward such skilled and person-centered services. The purpose of this article is to provide clinicians with practical strategies for guiding their assessment , goal writing , and intervention plans to meet the expectations of a person-centered approach to services for elders with dementia , using the Montessori approach as a philosophical guide.
