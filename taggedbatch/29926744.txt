 The introduction of light sheet fluorescence microscopy ( LSFM) has overcome the challenges in conventional optical microscopy. Among the recent breakthroughs in fluorescence microscopy , LSFM had been proven to provide a high three-dimensional spatial resolution , high signal-to-noise ratio , fast imaging acquisition rate , and minuscule levels of phototoxic and photodamage effects. The aforementioned auspicious properties are crucial in the biomedical and clinical research fields , covering a broad range of applications: from the super-resolution imaging of intracellular dynamics in a single cell to the high spatiotemporal resolution imaging of developmental dynamics in an entirely large organism. In this review , we provided a systematic outline of the historical development of LSFM , detailed discussion on the variants and improvements of LSFM , and delineation on the most recent technological advancements of LSFM and its potential applications in single molecule/particle detection , single-molecule super-resolution imaging , imaging intracellular dynamics of a single cell , multicellular imaging: cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions , plant developmental biology , and brain imaging and developmental biology.
