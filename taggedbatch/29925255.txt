 S-adenosylmethionine ( AdoMet) has been referred to as both `` a poor man 's adenosylcobalamin ( AdoCbl) '' and `` a rich man 's AdoCbl , '' but today , with the ever-increasing number of functions attributed to each cofactor , both appear equally rich and surprising. The recent characterization of an organometallic species in an AdoMet radical enzyme suggests that the line that differentiates them in nature will be constantly challenged. Here , we compare and contrast AdoMet and cobalamin ( Cbl) and consider why Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzymes require two cofactors that are so similar in their reactivity. We further carry out structural comparisons employing the recently determined crystal structure of oxetanocin-A biosynthetic enzyme OxsB , the first three-dimensional structural data on a Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzyme. We find that the structural motifs responsible for housing the AdoMet radical machinery are largely conserved , whereas the motifs responsible for binding additional cofactors are much more varied.
