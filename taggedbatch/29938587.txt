 The evaluation of the genetic structure of autochthonous pig breeds is very important for conservation of local pig breeds and preservation of diversity. In this study , 18 microsatellite loci were used to detect genetic relationship between autochthonous pig breeds ( Black Slavonian ( BS) , Turopolje pig ( TP) , and Croatian wild boar) and to determine phylogenetic relationship among Croatian autochthonous pig breeds and certain Asian and European pigs using the mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) D-loop sequence polymorphism. Relatively high degree of genetic variation was found between the observed populations. The analysis of mtDNA showed that haplotypes of the studied pig populations are different from the other European and Chinese haplotypes. BS pigs showed some similarities with Mangalitsa and Duroc breeds. The genetic distances of TP can be explained by high degree of inbreeding during the past century. Despite the European origin of Croatian pig breeds with some impact of Chinese breeds in the past , the results of present study show that genetic diversity is still pronounced within investigated breeds. Furthermore , the genetic diversity is even more pronounced between Croatian breeds and other European and Chinese pig breeds. Thus , conservation of Croatian pig breeds will contribute to overall genetic diversity preservation of pig breeds.
