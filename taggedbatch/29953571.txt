 As organ transplantation science continues to mature , both physicians and the public face challenges defining death and , subsequently , caring for an individual when they are deemed eligible for organ procurement. This paper revisits the anaesthesiologist 's role with respect to the provision of analgesic medication at the time of organ procurement. It provides a historical overview of the ethics of organ procurement , explaining how the definition of brain death and the ethical principle of the ` dead donor rule ' have shaped the practice of organ procurement. It concludes by suggesting that a re-framing of the ethics of organ procurement may be necessary in order for anaesthesiologists to meet their ethical obligation of preventing harm to organ donors while maintaining public trust in the medical profession.
