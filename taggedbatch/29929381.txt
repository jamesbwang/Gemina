 Although practitioners overwhelmingly agree on the importance of advance care planning ( ACP) and preparing for the end of life ( EOL) , the process is fraught with barriers. The goal of this research was to explore potential connections between providers ' own personal experiences and current professional practices in ACP and EOL care. A cross-sectional survey design , gathering voluntary , anonymous responses from participants between August and December 2016. The survey sought information from providers in 3 distinct areas: ( 1) personal experiences of loss , ( 2) personal ACP , and ( 3) professional practices related to ACP and EOL care. One hundred and ninety health-care professionals ( primarily physicians , nurses , and social workers) participated in the survey across a greater , Metropolitan area in the Midwest. Questions for professional practices were subscales from the End-of-Life Professional Caregiver Survey: Patient- and Family-Centered Communication ( PFCC) and Effective Care Delivery ( ECD). Questions developed by the research team were evaluated by judges chosen for clinical and/or research expertise. Numerous connections were found between professionals ' histories of loss , personal ACP , and professional practices. For example , both clinicians with personal experience caring for someone who is dying and clinicians who had completed their own ACP scored higher in both PFCC and ECD and were more likely to refer patients to hospice and palliative care. Results support educational interventions involving opportunities for reflection and completion and communication about ACP. Additionally , educational opportunities for students in health care should focus on incorporating both ACP and greater exposure to hospice and palliative care.
