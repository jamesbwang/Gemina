 Here , polyamidoamine grafted halloysite nanotubes ( PAMAM- g-HNTs) were synthesized for loading of siRNA in order to intracellular delivery of siRNA and treat of breast cancer via gene therapy. The successful grafting of PAMAM on HNTs was confirmed by various analytical methods. The size , zeta potential , and grafting ratio of PAMAM- g-HNTs is ∼ 206.2 nm , +19.8 mV , and 3.04 % , respectively. PAMAM- g-HNTs showed good cytocompatibility toward HUVECs ( 84.7 %) and MCF-7 cells ( 82.3 %) even at high concentration of 100 μg/mL. PAMAM- g-HNTs/siRNA exhibited enhanced cellular uptake efficiency of 94.3 % compared with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Lipo2000)/ siRNA ( 83.6 %). PAMAM- g-HNTs/small interfering RNA-vascular endothelial growth factor ( siVEGF) led to 78.0 % knockdown of cellular VEGF mRNA and induced 33.6 % apoptosis in the MCF-7 cells , which is also much higher than that of Lipo2000/siVEGF. In vivo anti-cancer results demonstrated that PAMAM- g-HNTs/siVEGF treated 4T1-bearing mice showed enhanced anti-cancer efficacy than Lipo2000/siVEGF group. Also , the nanocarrier system showed negligible toxic effects toward the major organs of mice. In vivo fluorescence imaging studies showed that there is a slight decrease in the fluorescence signal of PAMAM- g-HNTs/cy5-siVEGF after 72 h post-injection. Therefore , PAMAM- g-HNTs show promising application as novel nanovectors for siRNA delivery and gene therapy of cancer.
