 Runt-related transcription factor 2 ( Runx2) is involved in the early stage of tooth development. However , only few studies have reported the role of Runx2 in enamel development , which may be attributed to that Runx2 full knockout mice can not survive after birth. In the present study , we successfully established a Runx2-deficient mouse model using a conditional knockout ( cKO) method. We observed a significant reduction in the degree of mineralization and the decreased size of enamel rods in cKO mice. Histological analysis showed the retained enamel proteins in enamel layer at maturation stage in cKO molars. Further analysis by qRT-PCR revealed that the expressions of genes encoding enamel structure proteins , such as amelogenin ( AMELX) , ameloblastin ( AMBN) and enamelin ( ENAM) , were increased in cKO enamel organs. On the other hand , the expression of kallikrein-related peptidase-4 ( KLK4) at the mRNA and protein levels was dramatically decreased from late secretory stage to maturation stage in cKO enamel organs , while the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-20 ( MMP-20) was not significantly altered. Finally , immunohistochemistry indicated that the uptake of amelogenins by ameloblasts was significantly decreased in cKO mice. Taken together , Runx2 played critical roles in controlling enamel maturation by increasing synthesis of KLK4 and decreasing synthesis of AMELX , AMBN and ENAM.
