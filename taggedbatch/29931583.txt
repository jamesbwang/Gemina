 Despite the recent therapeutic progress , the prognoses of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas ( DLBCLs) that concomitantly overexpress c-MYC and BCL2 , i.e. , double hit lymphoma ( DHL) and double expressing lymphoma ( DEL) , remain poor. This study examined triple targeting of c-MYC , BCL2 and the B-cell receptor ( BCR) signaling pathway for DHL and DEL.. We first used AZD5153 , a novel bivalent inhibitor for bromodomain-containing 4 ( BRD4) , in DHL- and DEL-derived cell lines , because BRD4 regulates disease type-oriented key molecules for oncogenesis. AZD5153 was more effective than conventional monovalent BRD4 inhibitors , JQ1 and I-BET151 , in inhibiting cell proliferation of a DHL-derived cell line and two DEL-derived cell lines , with at least 10-fold lower half growth inhibitory concentrations. AZD5153 caused G1/S cell cycle blockade , while the apoptosis-inducing effect was relatively modest. At the molecular level , AZD5153 was potent in downregulating various molecules for oncogenesis , such as c-MYC , AKT2 and MAP3K; those involved in the BCR signaling pathway , such as CD19 , BLNK and CD79B; and those associated with B-cell development , such as IKZF1 , IKZF3 , PAX5 , POU2AF1 and EBF1. In contrast , AZD5153 did not decrease anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins , and did not activate pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins , except BAD. To augment cell death induction , we added a novel BH3-mimicking BCL2 inhibitor AZD4320 to AZD5153 , and found that these two agents had a mostly synergistic antitumor effect by increasing cells undergoing apoptosis in all three cell lines. These results provide a rationale for dual targeting of BRD4 and BCL2 using AZD5153 and AZD4320 as a therapeutic strategy against DHL and DEL..
