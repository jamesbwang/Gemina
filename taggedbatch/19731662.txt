 Herein , we investigated the chemical , electrochemical , and spectroscopic characteristics of humic acids ( HAs) extracted from sediments of different origin ( Ling Qiao river , Xi Xi wetland , Qi Zhen lake ( QZ) , and Hu Zhou pond in Zhejiang province , China) , paying particular attention to their role in the enhancement of nitrate and FeOOH reduction. Notably , the highest C/N ratio ( 16.16) , O/C ratio ( 1.89) , and Fe content ( 11.57 g kg
