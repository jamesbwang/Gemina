 The quality of autopsies is always questioned in courts , especially in developing countries. Wrong decisions or misjudgments are undesirable in medicine , but they are very dangerous in forensic medicine. If a wrong opinion is given , either a culprit can be acquitted or an innocent person can be sentenced. Therefore , an expert opinion is always required before the announcement of a judgment. To highlight the problem of accuracy in determining the cause of death in forensic autopsy.

The author seeks to critically analyze the post-mortem findings in relation to the cause and manner of death.
