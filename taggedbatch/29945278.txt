Each meta-analysis was done using the technique of mean difference and 95 % confidence intervals employing a random effects model with the Review Manager 5.3. , from the Cochrane Library. Significant statistical difference was accepted when the p value was less than 0.05 on the test of overall effect ( Z value). Qualitative evaluation was done using the data of 330 patients extracted from seven articles and the quantitative assessment with data of 200 patients from three reports.
