 In this work , the surface morphology of a hydrophobic organosilicon film was modified as it was deposited onto a silver seed layer with nanoparticles. The surface hydrophobicity evaluated by the water contact angle was significantly increased from 100 & deg; to 128 & deg; originating from the surface of the organosilicon film becoming roughened , and was deeply relevant to the Ag seed layer conform deposition. In addition , the organosilicon film became surface oleophobic and the surface hydrophobicity was improved due to the formation of the inactive C-F chemical on the surface after the carbon tetrafluoride glow discharge etching. The surface hydrophobicity and oleophobicity of the organosilicon film could be further optimized with water and oleic contact angles of about 138 & deg; and 61 & deg; , respectively , after an adequate fluorination etching.
