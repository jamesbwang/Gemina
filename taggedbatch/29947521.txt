 A formal ( 4 + 2) heterocycloaddition of non-heteroatom-stabilized alkynyl carbene complexes and iminopyrroles is described. The reaction implies a totally regioselective synthesis of 6-azaindole derivatives through the formation of the pyridine ring. The mechanism of the reaction has been explored by means of density functional theory calculations , which showed a preference for the ( 4 + 2) cycloaddition instead of the ( 2 + 2) or ( 3 + 3) cycloadditions observed with other imines. The structure of the products also shows an unusual connectivity pattern from carbene complexes.
