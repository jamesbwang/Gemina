 Retrospective study of a national database. To identify the incidence and risk factors for discharge to a rehabilitation facility after corrective surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS). The vast majority of patients who undergo surgery for AIS are discharged home , with limited data on rates and causes for discharge to a rehabilitation facility. The United States National Inpatient Sample database was queried for the years 2012 to 2014. Inclusion criteria were children aged 10-18 who underwent surgery for idiopathic scoliosis. Studied data included patient demographics , operative parameters , length of stay , and hospital charges. Perioperative complications were also examined , along with their association with discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Statistical analysis was performed via chi-squared testing and multivariate analysis , with significance defined as a p-value less than 0.05. A total of 17,275 patients were included ( 76.3 % female , mean age 14 years). Out of the entire cohort , 4.8 % of patients developed a complication and 0.6 % were discharged to a rehabilitation facility. The most common complications included respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> ( 2.3 %) , reintubation ( 0.8 %) and postoperative hematoma ( 0.8 %). Following multivariate analysis , male sex ( OR 4.7; 95 % CI , 1.8-12.2; p < 0.001) , revision surgery ( OR 29.6; 95 % CI , 5.7-153.5; p = 0.002) and development of a perioperative complication ( OR 12.3; 95 % CI , 4.7-32.4; p < 0.001) were found to be significant predictors of discharge to rehabilitation. Average length of stay was 8 ± 6 vs. 5 ± 3 days and hospital charges were $ 254,425 vs. $ 186,273 in the complication and control groups , respectively ( both p < 0.001). Discharge to rehabilitation after AIS surgery is uncommon. However , patients who are male , undergo revision procedures , or develop a complication may have a higher risk of a non-routine discharge. Complication occurrence also resulted in significantly longer lengths of stay and healthcare costs. 3.
