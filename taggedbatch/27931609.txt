 Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease ( PH-LHD) is the most common type of pulmonary hypertension , although an accurate prevalence is challenging. PH-LHD includes PH due to systolic or diastolic left ventricular dysfunction , mitral or aortic valve disease and congenital left heart disease. In recent years a new and distinct phenotype of `` combined post-capillary and pre-capillary PH , '' based on diastolic pulmonary gradient and pulmonary<disease> vascular resistance , has been recognized. The roles of right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary<disease> vascular compliance in PH-LHD have also been elucidated recently and they appear to have significant clinical implications. Echocardiography continues to play a seminal role in diagnosis of PH-LHD and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved LV ejection fraction , as it can identify valve disease and help to distinguish PH-LHD from pre-capillary PH. Right , and occasionally left heart catheterization , remains the gold-standard for diagnosis and phenotyping of PH-LHD , although Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging is emerging as a useful alternative tool in non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic assessment of PH-LHD. In this review , the latest evidence for more recent advances will be discussed , including the role of fluid challenge and exercise during cardiac catheterization to unravel occult post-capillary and the role of vasoreactivity testing. The use of many or all of these diagnostic techniques will undoubtedly provide key information about sub-groups of patients with PH-LHD that might benefit from medical therapy previously considered to be only suitable for pulmonary arterial hypertension.
