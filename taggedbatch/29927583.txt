 As one unique group of two-dimensional ( 2D) nanomaterials , 2D metal nanomaterials have drawn increasing attention owing to their intriguing physiochemical properties and broad range of promising applications. In this Review , we briefly introduce the general synthetic strategies applied to 2D metal nanomaterials , followed by describing in detail the various synthetic methods classified in two categories , i.e. bottom-up methods and top-down methods. After introducing the unique physical and chemical properties of 2D metal nanomaterials , the potential applications of 2D metal nanomaterials in catalysis , surface enhanced Raman scattering , sensing , bioimaging , solar cells , and photothermal therapy are discussed in detail. Finally , the challenges and opportunities in this promising research area are proposed.
