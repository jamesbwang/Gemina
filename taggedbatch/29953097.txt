 To analyze the ways and terms of training for laparoscopy-assisted reconstruction operations via learning curves analysis and to compare the outcomes obtained both during training for technique and after that. There were 93 reconstructive laparoscopic procedures in 58 ( 62.36 %) patients with terminal colostomy. All patients were operated by the same surgeon. Learning curves have been created and analyzed. Analysis showed that all surgical features are achieved by the 30 Improved results are achieved by reduced dissection of adhesions , the use of mechanical suture for intestinal anastomosis and increased number of anastomoses made in intracorporeal fashion.
