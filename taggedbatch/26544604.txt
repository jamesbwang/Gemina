 Evolutionary development of vision has provided us with the capacity to detect moving objects. Concordant shifts of visual features suggest movements of the observer , whereas discordant changes are more likely to be indicating independently moving objects , such as predators or prey. Such distinction helps us to focus attention , adapt our behavior , and adjust our motor patterns to meet behavioral challenges. However , the neural basis of distinguishing self-induced and self-independent visual motions is not clarified in unrestrained animals yet. In this study , we investigated the presence and origin of motion-related visual information in the striatum<pathogen> of rats , a hub of action selection and procedural memory. We found that while almost half of the neurons in the dorsomedial striatum<pathogen> are sensitive to visual motion congruent with locomotion ( and that many of them also code for spatial location) , only a small subset of them are composed of fast-firing interneurons that could also perceive self-independent visual stimuli. These latter cells receive their visual input at least partially from the secondary visual cortex ( V2). This differential visual sensitivity may be an important support in adjusting behavior to salient environmental events. It emphasizes the importance of investigating visual motion perception in unrestrained animals.
