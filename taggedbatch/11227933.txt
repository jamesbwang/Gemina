 To compare the efficacy , improved quality of life , and prognosis in patients undergoing either subtotal colonic bypass with antiperistaltic cecoproctostomy ( SCBAC) or subtotal colonic bypass plus colostomy with antiperistaltic cecoproctostomy ( SCBCAC) for the treatment of slow transit constipation<symptom>. Between October 2010 and October 2014 , aged patients with slow transit constipation<symptom> who were hospitalized and underwent laparoscopic surgery in our institute were divided into two groups: the bypass group , 15 patients underwent SCBAC , and the bypass plus colostomy group , 14 patients underwent SCBCAC. The following preoperative and postoperative clinical data were collected: gender , age , body mass index , operative time , first flatus time , length of hospital stay , bowel movements ( BMs) , Wexner fecal incontinence scale , Wexner constipation<symptom> scale ( WCS) , gastrointestinal quality of life index ( GIQLI) , numerical rating scale for pain intensity ( NRS) , abdominal bloating score ( ABS) , and Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications ( CD) before surgery and at 3 , 6 , 12 , and 24 mo after surgery. All patients successfully underwent laparoscopic surgery without open surgery conversion or surgery-related death. The operative time and blood<symptom> loss<symptom> were significantly less in the bypass group than in the bypass plus colostomy group ( Laparoscopic SCBCAC is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of slow transit constipation<symptom> in an aged population and can significantly improve the prognosis. Its clinical efficacy is more favorable compared with that of SCBAC. Laparoscopic SCBCAC is a better procedure for the treatment of slow transit constipation<symptom> in an aged population.
