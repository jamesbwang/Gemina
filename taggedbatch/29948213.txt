 Proliferation of anchorage-dependent cells occurs after adhesion to a suitable surface. Thus , quantitative information about the force of cells adhesion to microcarriers at early culture phases is vital for scaling up such system. In this work , a newly designed shear-generating device was proposed , based on a previously proposed contraction flow device designed for suspended cells. A design equation for the new device was also proposed to correlate the generated energy dissipation rate ( EDR) with the cross-sectional area and flow rate. Microscopic-particle image velocimetry was measured to validate the simulation results , and good agreement was achieved. The newly designed device was then used to measure the adhesion force of MDCK and PK cells , and the results showed that the critical EDR was 3000 W/m
