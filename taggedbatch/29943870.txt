 Software-based beamforming which utilizes delay and standard beamforming is a signal processing technique that temporarily stores data from each probe element to improve specular reflections to improve the image resolution. We compared a software algorithm which uses delay and standard beamforming with delay and sum beamforming in standard , hardware to evaluate endocardial borders and need for echo contrast. In this prospective study , eligible participants were ≥ 18 years of age referred clinically for transthoracic echocardiograms. A limited study consisting of three views ( apical 4 , apical 3 , and apical 2 chamber) was performed with the software-based beamforming and standard platform. Number and quality of segments visualized were evaluated using a 17-segment model. Quality of segments was graded as 0 = not visualized , 1 = incompletely visualized , or 2 = completely visualized. Overall quality score for each study ( 0 = poor , 1 = adequate , 2 = good) was reported. The need for contrast was determined by ASE guidelines. A total of 101 patients ( mean age 61 ± 16 years , males 52 %) were enrolled. Mean number of segments visualized in apical 4- ( 6.28 vs 5.65 , P < .001) , apical 3- ( 6.27 vs 5.54 , P < .001) , and apical 2-chamber views ( 6.26 vs 5.72 P < .001) was higher with the software vs standard platform. The average overall score for image quality was significantly better for the software platform vs standard ( 1.4 vs 0.9 , P = < .001). With the software platform , 23 % were judged as requiring contrast as compared with 45 % for the standard platform ( P < .001). Delay and standard beamforming in software platform identified more segments with better image quality when compared to the standard high-end platform , decreasing the need for contrast usage.
