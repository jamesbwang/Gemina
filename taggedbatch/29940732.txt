 Rivers export roughly 250 Pg of dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) to coastal oceans. DOC exported from rivers can be a reflection of watershed dynamics , and changes in land use can lead to shifts in the molecular composition and reactivity of riverine DOC. About 10 % of DOC exported from rivers is dissolved black carbon ( DBC) , a collection of polycondensed aromatic compounds derived from the incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels. While DOC and DBC export are generally coupled , the effects of watershed land use on DBC quality are not well understood. In this study , DBC samples were collected throughout the Altamaha River watershed in Georgia , USA. DBC was characterized using the benzenepoly ( carboxylic acid) method and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ( FTICR-MS). DBC had a more polycondensed character in areas of the watershed with less anthropogenic disturbance. Furthermore , FTICR-MS revealed that DBC became enriched with a lower molecular weight , heteroatomic signature in response to higher anthropogenic activity. As global land cover continues to change , this study demonstrates on a localized scale that watershed land use can influence the export and composition of DBC , which may have further implications for global carbon and nutrient cycling.
