 Vascular calcification is a common and severe complication in patients with atherosclerosis which is exacerbated by type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our laboratory recently reported that the collagen receptor discoidin domain receptor 1 ( DDR1) mediates vascular calcification in atherosclerosis; however , the underlying mechanisms are unknown. During calcification , vascular smooth muscle cells transdifferentiate into osteoblast-like cells , in a process driven by the transcription factor RUNX2 ( runt-related transcription factor 2). DDR1 signals via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway , which is also central to insulin signaling , and upstream of RUNX2 , and this led us to investigate whether DDR1 promotes vascular calcification in diabetes mellitus via this pathway. APPROACH AND RESULTS: These novel findings demonstrate that DDR1 promotes RUNX2 activity and atherosclerotic vascular calcification in diabetes mellitus via phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling.
