 Exome-based panels are becoming the preferred diagnostic strategy in clinical laboratories. This approach enables dynamic gene content update and , if needed , cost-effective reflex<symptom> to whole-exome sequencing. Currently , no guidelines or appropriate resources are available to support the clinical implementation of exome-based panels. Here , we highlight principles and important considerations for the clinical development and validation of exome-based panels. In addition , we developed ExomeSlicer , a novel , web-based resource , which uses empirical exon-level next-generation sequencing quality metrics to predict and visualize technically challenging exome-wide regions in any gene or genes of interest. Exome sequencing data from 100 clinical epilepsy cases were used to illustrate the clinical utility of ExomeSlicer in predicting poor-quality regions and its impact on streamlining the ad hoc Sanger sequencing fill in burden. With the use of ExomeSlicer , > 2100 low complexity and/or high-homology regions affecting > 1615 genes across the exome were also characterized. These regions can be a source of false-positive or false-negative variant calls , which can lead to misdiagnoses in tested patients and/or inaccurate functional annotations. We provide important considerations and a novel resource for the clinical development of exome-based panels.
