 Photo-contact dermatitis<disease> ( PCD) describes the adverse cutaneous reaction that occurs in some patients as a result of simultaneous exposure to a contactant and to light. PCD can be subdivided into photo-allergic and photo-irritant dermatitis<disease> depending on whether the contactant respectively invokes an allergic or irritant reaction. Photo-irritant reactions are commonly caused by plants , psoralens , and medications taken internally , whereas photo-allergic reactions are commonly caused by sunscreens and topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. The work-up of photo-contact dermatitis<disease> includes a thorough history and physical exam augmented by patch and/or photopatch testing , as the cornerstone of treatment for PCD is identification and avoidance of the irritating or allergenic chemical. Photo-contact dermatitis<disease> has the potential to significantly impact quality of life , so an informed approach to diagnosis and management is critical. Clinical mimics of PCD include polymorphic light eruption , solar urticaria , actinic prurigo , hydroa vacciniforme , cutaneous porphyrias , and systemic disorders with photosensitivity such as lupus and dermatomyositis. Herein , we review the clinical presentation , differential diagnosis ( including the clinical mimics mentioned above) , pathogenic mechanisms , diagnostic testing , and therapeutic considerations for PCD.
