 Age-related declines in attention and working memory ( WM) are well documented and may be worsened by the occurrence of distracting information. Emotionally valenced stimuli may have particularly strong distracting effects on cognition. We investigated age-related differences in emotional distraction using task-fMRI. WM performance in older adults was lower for emotional compared with neutral distractors , suggesting a disproportional impairment elicited by emotional task-irrelevant information. Critically , older adults were particularly distracted by task-irrelevant positive information , whereas the opposite pattern was found for younger adults. Age groups differed markedly in the brain response to emotional distractors; younger adults activated posterior cortical regions and the striatum<pathogen> , and older adults activated frontal regions. Also , an age by valence interaction was found for IFG and ACC , suggesting differential modulation of attention to task-relevant emotional information. These results provide new insights into age-related changes in emotional processing and the ability to resolve interference from emotional distraction.
