 The elderly are high risk for chronic<disease> diseases<disease> and multiple drug use- two problems that make geriatric medication use more complex; as a result , the possibility of duplicate prescriptions and drug interactions increase , affecting patient safety. The objective of this study was to develop an Intelligent Prescription System Combined with a National PharmaCloud for Geriatrics Care ( IPSPcG) that can reduce the occurrence of duplicate prescriptions. The system was implemented in a teaching hospital in Taiwan. The IPSPcG consists of two major components: ( 1) the collection module and ( 2) Intelligent Knowledge-base Module. Data on medication prescription behaviors and medication-blocking rates were gathered from January 2015 to December 2017. Overall , during the study period , the IPSPcG system included 39,678 prescriptions. Antihypertensive medications were included at the highest proportion ( 8962 , 22.6 %). The system changed physician 's prescription behavior ( p < .001) and decreased potential duplicate prescription times ( 14 %). The results of this study show that integrating appropriate recommendations from drug messages can reduce repeated drug prescriptions. Due to the diversity of diseases , the diversity and accuracy of medical advice must improve. The results of the ` Comprehensive Prescription Information ' provided by this system can serve as a reference for future research.
