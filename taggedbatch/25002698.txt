 Both intrinsic and extrinsic plant processes affect the fate of flowers along an inflorescence in sequentially flowering plants. We investigated whether the intrinsic process of competition for limited resource between fruits and flowers owing to resource preemption or sink strength of basal fruits , or architectural effects due to positional differences in the probability of retaining flowers , explains a lower probability of retaining distal flowers in
