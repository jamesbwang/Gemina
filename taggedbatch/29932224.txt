 Buildings and learning spaces contribute in crucial ways to people 's experiences of these spaces. However , this aspect of context has been under-researched in medical education. We addressed this gap in knowledge by using the conceptual notions of space and place as heuristic lenses through which to explore the impact of a new medical school building on student experiences. We carried out an exploratory case study to explore the impact of a new medical school building on student experiences. Data were collected from archived documents ( n = 50) , interviews with key stakeholders ( n = 17) and focus group discussions with students ( n = 17 participants) to provide context and aid triangulation. Data coding and analysis were initially inductive and conducted using thematic analysis. After themes had emerged , we applied the concepts of boundary objects , liminal space and Foucault 's panopticon to provide a framework for the data. There were specific visions<symptom> and intentions for the place ( the location) and space ( the facilities) of the new medical school building ( e.g. it was positioned to facilitate flow between educational and clinical settings). However , the unintentional consequences of the planning were that students felt disconnected from the wider university , trapped on the health care campus , and under pressure to behave not like students but in a manner they believed to be expected by clinical staff and patients. Despite much effort and a focus on creating an idyllic space and place , the new medical school had both positive and ( unintentionally) negative impacts on student experiences. These findings highlight the importance of reflecting on , and exploring , how space and place may influence and shape students ' learning experiences during the formative years of their development of a professional identity , a necessary consideration when planning new medical school learning spaces or changing these spaces.
