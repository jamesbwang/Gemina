 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease ( CMT) was initially described in 1886. It is characterized by defects in the peripheral nervous system , including sensory and motor neurons. Although more than 80 CMT-causing genes have been identified to date , an effective therapy has not yet been developed for this disease. Since Drosophila does not have axons surrounded by myelin sheaths or Schwann cells , the establishment of a demyelinating CMT model is not appropriate. In this chapter , after overviewing CMT , examples of Drosophila CMT models with axonal neuropathy and other animal CMT models are described.
