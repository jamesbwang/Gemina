 Among the pneumococcal proteins , pneumococcal surface protein A ( PspA) is considered the most promising candidate for a serotype-independent vaccine. This study aimed to investigate the serotype , genetic diversity of PspA , lineage ( genotype) and drug resistance traits of pneumococcal isolates from paediatric patients. A total of 678 non-invasive pneumococcal isolates obtained from June to November 2016 were analysed. All isolates were characterized for PspA families , serotypes and macrolide resistance genes. Seventy-one representative isolates of non-vaccine serotypes ( NVTs) were genetically analysed for the clade-defining region ( CDR) of PspA , as well as multi-locus sequence typing ( MLST). The detection rate of NVTs was 87.9 % ( n = 596) , including dominant NVTs 15A ( 14.5 % , n = 98) , 35B ( 11.8 % , n = 80) , 15C ( 9.3 % , n = 63) and 23A ( 9.0 % , n = 61). Most isolates ( 96.6 %) possessed macrolide resistance genes erm ( B) and/or mef ( A/E). PspA families 1 , 2 and 3 were detected in 42.3 , 56.6 and 0.6 % of isolates , respectively. Nucleotide sequences of CDR showed high identity ( 90-100 %) within the same PspA clade , although the CDR identity among different PspA families ranged from 53 to 69 %. All isolates of NVTs 23A , 10A , 34 , 24 , 22F/22A , 33F , 23B and 38 were from PspA family 1 , while NVTs 35B , 15C , 15B and 11A/11D isolates were from family 2. In contrast , genetically distinct PspAs were found in NVTs 6C and 15A. PspA family 3/clade 6 was detected in only NVT serotype 37 isolates assigned to ST447 and ST7970 , showing the mucoid phenotype. The present study revealed the predominance of PspA families 1 and 2 in NVTs , and the presence of family 3 in serotype 37.
