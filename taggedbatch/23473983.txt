 The emergence of novel structures during evolution is crucial for creating variation among organisms , but the underlying processes which lead to the emergence of evolutionary novelties are poorly understood. The gnathostome jaw joint is such a novelty , and the incorporation of We show that Ly-294,002 upregulates Development of additional mandibular cartilages is not unusual in larval anurans. Therefore , changes in the
