 Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) is associated with drastic changes in metabolism leading to a cardiac energy deficiency well as maladaptive changes in multiple other tissues. It is still unclear which of these changes originates from cardiomyocyte metabolic remodeling or whether they are induced secondarily by systemic factors. Our aim here was to induce cardiac restricted metabolic changes mimicking those seen in HF and to characterize the associated metabolite changes in the heart , circulation and peripheral tissues. We generated a cardiac specific PGC-1α knockout mice ( KO) to specifically induce metabolic dysregulation typically accompanied by HF and performed a non-targeted LC-MS metabolite profiling analysis of heart , plasma , liver and skeletal muscle<symptom> to identify metabolites associated with cardiac specific metabolic remodeling. The KO animals developed a progressive cardiomyopathy with cardiac dilatation leading to fatal HF. At 17 weeks of age , when significant remodeling had occurred but before the onset of HF , isolated PGC-1α deficient cardiomyocytes had suppressed glucose and fatty acid oxidation as well as blunted anaerobic metabolism. KO hearts displayed a distinctive metabolite profile with 92 significantly altered molecular features including metabolite changes in energy metabolism , phospholipid metabolism , amino acids and oxidative stress signaling. Some of the metabolite changes correlated with the specific parameters of cardiac function. We did not observe any significant alterations in the metabolomes of the other measured tissues or in plasma. Heart specific PGC-1α KO induces metabolic , functional and structural abnormalities leading to dilating cardiomyopathy and HF. The metabolic changes were limited to the cardiac tissue indicating that cardiomyocyte metabolic remodeling is not sufficient to evoke the body wide metabolic alterations usually associated with HF.
