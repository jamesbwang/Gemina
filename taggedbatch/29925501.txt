 Glucagon , an essential regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism , also promotes weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , in part through potentiation of fibroblast-growth factor 21 ( FGF21) secretion. However , FGF21 is only a partial mediator of metabolic actions ensuing from GcgR-activation , prompting us to search for additional pathways. Intriguingly , chronic GcgR agonism increases plasma bile acid levels. We hypothesized that GcgR agonism regulates energy metabolism , at least in part , through farnesoid X receptor ( FXR). To test this hypothesis , we studied whole body and liver-specific FXR knockout (
