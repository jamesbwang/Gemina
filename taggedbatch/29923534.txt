 Prematurity is one of the leading causes of neonatal and under-five mortalities globally and also in India. It is an important determinant of short- and long-term morbidities in infants and children. Unfortunately , risk factors of majority of preterm births ( PTBs) remain unexplained which calls for appropriate action. There is a dearth of community-based research on PTB and its risk factors , especially in high burden countries like India. The objective of the study was to explore different risk factors for PTB. A cohort of 1977 antenatal mothers was enrolled at household level by trained field investigators and was followed up in four districts of Gujarat , India , to document the outcome of pregnancy. Pretested and structured questionnaires were used to collect information. A hierarchical regression model was used to analyze the risk factors for PTB. Proportion of PTB was 9 % among the enrolled cohort. Risk factors which were found to be significant on applying the hierarchical model were periodontal<disease> disease<disease> , long sleep duration , and sex during any trimester. The study suggests an urgent need for strengthening of existing guidelines for effective , evidence-based , and culturally appropriate interventions for prevention of PTB. Maintenance of good oral hygiene should find a place in routine recommendations for pregnant women , and antenatal examinations should include screening for oral hygiene also.
