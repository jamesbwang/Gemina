 Pulmonary endothelial cells ' ( ECs) injury and apoptotic death are necessary and sufficient for the pathogenesis of the acute<pathogen><disease><symptom> respiratory distress syndrome<disease><symptom> ( ARDS) , regardless of epithelial damage. Interaction of dysfunctional ECs with circulatory extracellular vesicles ( EVs) holds therapeutic promise in ARDS. However , the presence in the blood of long-term ARDS survivors of EVs with a distinct phenotype compared to the EVs of non-surviving patients is not reported. With a multidisciplinary translational approach , we studied EVs from the blood of 33 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. The EVs were isolated from the blood of ARDS and control subjects. Immunoblotting and magnetic beads immunoisolation complemented by standardized flow cytometry and nanoparticles tracking analyses identified in the ARDS patients a subset of EVs with mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC) origin ( CD73 The expression pattern of Runx1 isoforms might be a reliable circulatory biomarker of ARDS activity and a novel determinant of the molecular mechanism for lung vascular/tissue repair and recovery after severe injury.
