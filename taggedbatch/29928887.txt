 We explored the molecular and behavioral effects of a perineural Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- mediated inflammatory priming on the development and maintenance of painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy ( PPTTN) following infra-orbital nerve chronic constriction injury ( CCI-IoN) in rats. Rats were pretreated with repetitive perineural injections in the vicinity of the IoN of either LPS or vehicle ( Vhcl) before being submitted to CCI-IoN. Orofacial pain-like behaviors ( response to Von Frey Filament testing and spontaneous isolated face grooming) were measured during the period of LPS injections ( three weeks) and following CCI-IoN surgery ( two weeks). Local LPS administration induced an early pain-like behavior ( i.e. an increase in spontaneous<symptom> pain<symptom> ( SP) or mechanical static allodynia ( MSA)) in both conditions , and following CCI-IoN , MSA and SP developed earlier and more severely in LPS-pretreated rats than in the control group. Ipsilateral increases of key neuropathic pain mRNA markers in the IoN parenchyma , trigeminal ganglia ( TG) and spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis ( Sp5C) were observed in CCI-IoN injured animals as compared to controls. Although no significant molecular differences could be observed within the IoN parenchyma between LPS and Vhcl-pretreated animals , a significant increase of key inflammatory cytokine Interleukin 1 beta ( IL- 1β) could be found in the TG of LPS-pretreated CCI-injured animals versus controls. Finally , a higher increase of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS) in ipsilateral Sp5C of LPS-pretreated animals was observed as compared to Sp5C of Vhcl-pretreated animals. These results suggest a key role of inflammatory priming in the development and maintenance of PPTTN implicating IL-1β/ iNOS-dependent central sensitization mechanisms.
