 Thirty years ago , Parr and Yang postulated that favorable chemical processes are associated with large changes in the electronic chemical potential or , equivalently , the electronegativity. They called this the '' | Δμ | big is good '' rule and noted that if the rule could be justified , then it `` would constitute a validation of frontier theory from first principles. '' We provide a simple and insightful justification for the '' | Δμ | big is good '' rule , with special emphasis on electron-transfer reactions. Furthermore , we show that it implies Pearson 's hard/soft acid/base principle mathematically and confirm this result with numerical examples. This supports Parr 's intuition that many other reactivity precepts arise as corollaries to the more fundamental '' | Δμ | big is good '' rule. In all of this , it is essential to consider the intensive nature of the chemical potential.
