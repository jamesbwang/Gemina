 After spinal<disease> cord injury ( SCI) , the initial goals of urological management include maintaining safe storage of urine with efficient bladder emptying , maximising urinary continence , and minimising the risk of urological complications. This review was performed according to the methodology recommended by the Joint SIU-ICUD International Consultation. Embase and Medline databases were used to identify literature relevant to the early urological care of SCI patients. Recommendations were developed by consensus and graded using a modified Oxford system which identifies level of evidence ( LOE) and grade of recommendation ( GOR). Clinicians must ensure appropriate bladder emptying immediately after SCI ( LOE 3 , GOR A) and perform the initial neuro-urological assessment within 3 months after injury ( LOE 3 , GOR A) , including history , validated questionnaires , bladder diary , physical examination , measurement of renal function , and urinary<disease> tract imaging ( LOE 4 , GOR B). Urodynamics , if available video-urodynamics , must be performed to detect and specify lower urinary<disease> tract dysfunction ( LOE 1 , GOR A). Spontaneous voiding and/or intermittent catheterization must be considered in appropriate patients once they are medically stable ( LOE 3 , GOR A). Antimuscarinics are the first-line and intradetrusor botulinum<pathogen> toxin A injections are the second-line treatment for neurogenic detrusor overactivity ( LOE 1 , GOR A). Irreversible surgical interventions should be delayed until the second year after injury due to the potential for neurological recovery ( LOE 4 , GOR B). Careful clinical assessment and pertinent urological testing including urodynamic investigation are necessary for appropriate counselling and treatment of new SCI patients.
