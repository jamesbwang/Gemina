 To study the effects of dihydroartemisinin ( DHA) on radiation sensitivity of Raji cells , and explore its mechanisms. CCK8 was used to determine the effect of DHA on cell viability of Raji cells; apoptosis , intracellular reactive oxygen speies ( ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential of Raji cells were detected by flow cytometry; and the protein expressions of protein kinase B ( AKT) , phospho-rylated-protein kinase B ( p-AKT) , Bcl-2 and Bax were determined by Western blot. The cells were randomly divided into four groups: control group , DHA ( 5μmol/L DHA) , irradiation ( IR , 4 Gy) , IR+DHA group ( 4 Gy IR +5 μmol/L DHA). Compared with the other three groups , cells in DHA+IR group exhibited lower mitochondrial membrane potential ( DHA might activate the mitochondrial apoptotic signal
