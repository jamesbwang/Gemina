 The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety , tolerability , and efficacy of a brand-generic glatiramer acetate product in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis over a 12-month period. A noninterventional cohort study was conducted on 185 patients. The patients had a confirmed and documented diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis as defined by the Revised McDonald Criteria ( 2010) , were ambulatory with a Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 0 to 5.5 , and their treatment by glatiramer acetate 40 mg/mL was just started. Adverse drug reactions , relapse rate , magnetic resonance imaging parameters , and Expanded Disability Status Scale score were evaluated over 1 year. Of 185 enrolled patients from 21 different cities , 170 completed the study. The mean ( SD) Expanded Disability Status Scale score was 1.97 ( 0.75) at the time of screening. The mean age was 33 years with an average of 4-year multiple sclerosis history , and 83 % were women. Hepatic disorder and depression<symptom> were the most frequent medical history. The most common adverse drug reactions were local pain ( 45.4 %) and erythema ( 38.9 %). The immediate postinjection reactions included dyspnea<symptom> ( 10.3 %) , anxiety<symptom> ( 9.7 %) , palpitation ( 8.1 %) , urticaria ( 5.4 %) , flushing ( 3.24 %) , chest<symptom> pain<symptom> ( 2.16 %) , and throat<symptom> constriction ( 0.54 %). The percentage of relapse-free patients at Month 12 was 87 % , and the annual relapse rate was 0.134. An increase in the Expanded Disability Status Scale score was observed in 20 % of patients , and new T2 and gadolinium-enhancing lesions<symptom> were found in 34.7 % and 9.4 % , respectively. The rate of treatment failure was 1.6 % and 4.3 % according to the Modified Rio<pathogen> and Rio scores , respectively. The 40 mg brand-generic glatiramer acetate product was well tolerated in this selected group of Iranian patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis , and patient adherence was favorable over 1 year.
