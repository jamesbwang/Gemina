 The main focus of this systematic review was to determine the efficacy of phototherapy in the management of creatine kinase ( CK) activity after exercise and furthermore to identify for which exercise model protocol phototherapy provides the best results. Meta-analysis comparing phototherapy with a control condition. The MEDLINE , EMBASE , SPORTDiscus , PEDro , and CENTRAL databases were searched from their earliest records to October 03 , 2016. Data were pooled in a meta-analysis and described as standardized mean difference ( SMD) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) using a random effects model. Healthy subjects ( no restrictions were applied , eg , age , sex , and exercise level). Phototherapy ( low-level laser therapy and/or light-emitting diode therapy) before or after exercise and a placebo or control condition. Creatine kinase activity ( no restriction to any analysis , eg , serum , plasma , or capillary blood). Fourteen studies were included for review. The results revealed that phototherapy has a more positive effect than control condition in management of CK activity ( SMD = 0.77 , 95 % CI ( 0.32 to 1.22); P = 0.0007; I = 72 %). In exploratory analysis , the results showed that phototherapy was effective only in the exercise protocol with localized exercise with large effect size ( localized exercise: SMD = 0.89 , 95 % CI ( 0.26 to 1.51); P = 0.0002; I = 76 %; general exercise: SMD = 0.61 , 95 % CI ( -0.05 to 1.26); P = 0.07; I = 67 %). The available evidence suggest that phototherapy has beneficial effects on the management of CK activity and demonstrate a possible relationship based on damage caused by exercise , providing a greater effect in studies that used localized exercise.
