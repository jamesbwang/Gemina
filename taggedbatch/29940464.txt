 Obesity and associated disorders such as metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> and type 2 diabetes ( T2D) have reached epidemic proportions. Several natural products have been reported as Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor ( PPAR) agonists , functioning as lead compounds towards developing new anti-diabetic drugs due to adverse side effects of existing PPAR drugs. We recently isolated and identified ( 7E) -9-oxohexadec-7-enoic acid ( 1) and ( 10E) -9-oxohexadec-10-enoic acid ( 2) from the marine algae<pathogen> Chaetoceros karianus. Herein we report the total synthesis , pharmacological characterization , and biological evaluations of these naturally occurring oxo-fatty acids ( oFAs). The syntheses of 1 and 2 afforded sufficient material for extensive biological evaluations. Both oFAs show an appreciable dose-dependent activation of PPARα and- γ , with EC
