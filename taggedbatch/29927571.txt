 The emphasis on ubiquitous technology means that future technological applications will depend heavily on transparent conducting materials. To facilitate truly ubiquitous applications , transparent conductors should be fabricated at low temperatures ( < 50 °C). Here , we demonstrate an instantaneous ( < 100 ns) and low-temperature ( < 45 °C at the substrate) method , excimer laser irradiation , for the transformation of an a-InGaZnO semiconductor into a transparent highly conductive oxide with performance rivaling traditional and emerging transparent conductors. Our analysis shows that the instantaneous and substantial conductivity enhancement is due to the generation of a large amount of oxygen vacancies in a-InGaZnO after irradiation. The method 's combination of low temperature , extremely rapid process , and applicability to other materials will create a new class of transparent conductors for the high-throughput roll-to-roll fabrication of future flexible devices.
