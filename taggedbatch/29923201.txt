 The division and differentiation of cells are the basis of growth and development. Cytokinin plays an active role in cell growth division and differentiation. The Related to ABI3/VP1 ( RAV) family comprises transcription factors in plants and all contain both AP2 and B3-like domains. In this study , GmRAV1 ( Glycine max) , which belongs to the AP2/ERF transcription factor family , was isolated and functionally characterized. Subcellular localization showed that GmRAV1 was localized to the nucleus and qRT-PCR analysis indicated that GmRAV1 was induced by cytokinin. Furthermore , compared with WT plants , plants overexpressing GmRAV1 showed dwarfism and late maturity. In contrast , the mutant of TEMPRANILLO ( tem1) and GmRAV-i plants had an opposite phenotype. More interestingly , a root and shoot regeneration experiment indicated that GmRAV1 is one of the most important positive regulators of the cytokinin signaling pathway , which is involved in promoting root and shoot regeneration. In addition , RNA-seq and qRT-PCR results indicated that GmRAV1 is related to the key factors involved in the cytokinin signaling pathway , namely , cytokinin oxidase ( GmCKX6 and GmCKX7) , purine permease ( GmPUP1) , cell cyclin related genes ( GmCycA2; 4 , GmCycD3 and GmCYC1) , cyclin-dependent kinase ( GmCDKB2) , cell division cycle ( GmCDC20) , E2F transcription factors ( GmE2FE) and authentic response regulator ( GmARR9). In conclusion , GmRAV1 , one of the most important positive regulators involved in promoting root and shoot regeneration , was induced by cytokinin and is related to the key factors of the cytokinin signaling pathways.
