 To optimise measurement precision , relevance to patients and flexibility , patient-reported outcome measures ( PROMs) should ideally be adapted to the individual patient/study while retaining direct comparability of scores across patients/studies. This is achievable using item banks and computerised adaptive tests ( CATs). The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 ( QLQ-C30) is one of the most widely used PROMs in cancer research and clinical practice. Here we provide an overview of the research program to develop CAT versions of the QLQ-C30 's 14 functional and symptom domains. The EORTC Quality of Life Group 's strategy for developing CAT item banks consists of: literature search to identify potential candidate items; formulation of new items compatible with the QLQ-C30 item style; expert evaluations and patient interviews; field-testing and psychometric analyses , including factor analysis , item response theory calibration and simulation of measurement properties. In addition , software for setting up , running and scoring CAT has been developed. Across eight rounds of data collections , 9782 patients were recruited from 12 countries for the field-testing. The four phases of development resulted in a total of 260 unique items across the 14 domains. Each item bank consists of 7-34 items. Psychometric evaluations indicated higher measurement precision and increased statistical power of the CAT measures compared to the QLQ-C30 scales. Using CAT , sample size requirements may be reduced by approximately 20-35 % on average without loss of power. The EORTC CAT Core represents a more precise , powerful and flexible measurement system than the QLQ-C30. It is currently being validated in a large independent , international sample of cancer patients.
