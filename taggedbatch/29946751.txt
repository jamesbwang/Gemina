 Purpose Recent changes in preventive guidelines ( e.g. , pap testing , mammography) have resulted in confusion<symptom> for both providers and patients. These changes have occurred either because new research has been introduced or because evidence for the practice is not established. Public health has the responsibility to promote the dissemination and implementation of changing guidelines into practice to improve the public 's health. Health literacy may facilitate this process. The purpose of this study is to describe a teaching tool applying principles of health literacy to changes in prevention guidelines. The objectives of the teaching activity were to: ( 1) understand the development of evidence-informed prevention guidelines; and ( 2) use health literacy to evaluate the target population 's perspectives on the guideline change using a health literacy approach. Description An interactive lecture and a practice-based assignment were created; the assignment was pilot-tested in graduate Women 's Health classes. Multiple final products were developed in order to facilitate the lecture and assignment: ( 1) lesson plan; ( 2) slide presentation; ( 3) health literacy interview guide worksheet; and ( 4) grading rubric. After the presentation , students interviewed women from the guideline target population using health literacy constructs and synthesized their findings to create an overall assessment report. Assessment Feedback from the pilot test informed the revision of the teaching activity. Conclusions This teaching tool can be applied in a wide variety of settings in higher education , such as courses in public health , nursing , or medicine. As health literacy continues to be an important determinant of health status , integrating this determinant into the dissemination and communication of preventive guideline changes is needed.
