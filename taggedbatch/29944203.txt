 Small-molecule regulation is a powerful switching tool to manipulate cell signal transduction for a desired function; however , most available methods usually require genetic engineering to endow cells with responsiveness to user-defined small molecules. Herein , we demonstrate a nongenetic approach for small-molecule-controlled receptor activation and consequent cell behavior manipulation that is based on DNA-mediated chemically induced dimerization ( D-CID). D-CID uses a programmable chemical-responsive DNA nanodevice to trigger DNA strand displacement and induce the activation of c-Met , a tyrosine kinase receptor cognate for hepatocyte growth factor , through dimerization. Through the use of various functional nucleic acids , including aptamers and DNAzymes , as recognition modules , the versatility of D-CID in inducing c-Met signaling upon addition of various small-molecular or ionic cues , including ATP , histidine , and Zn
