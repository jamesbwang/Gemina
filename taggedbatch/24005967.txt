 We examined the repellent , insecticidal , and anti-oviposition activities of the ethanol-extracted essential oil of Gardenia jasminoides against Bemisia tabaci and Tetranychus urticae adult<disease> and nymph stages under laboratory and greenhouse conditions. We used GC-MS to identify the main chemicals in the essential oil and selected four compounds , squalene , ethyl linoleate , n-hexadecanoic acid and 9-12-octadecadienoic , to evaluate their activity on whiteflies and mites. In the laboratory experiments , the essential oil of G. jasminoides showed maximum effects in fumigation against whitefly adults ( 81.48 %) and contact toxicity against whitefly nymphs ( 46.44 %) , adult mites ( 49.81 %) , and mite nymphs ( 66.46 %). In the greenhouse experiments , squalene showed maximum repellency against whitefly adults at 24 ( 89.59 %) and 48 h ( 84.76 %) , whitefly nymphal toxicity at 24 ( 80.08 %) and 48 h ( 77.28 %) , and mite toxicity at 24 ( 78.74 %) and 48 h ( 73.86 %). The essential oil showed maximum anti-oviposition activity against whiteflies at 24 ( 63.58 %) and 48 h ( 59.56 %) and toxicity to mite nymphs at 24 ( 82.45 %) and 48 h ( 57.14 %) in the bioassay. The essential oil had LC
