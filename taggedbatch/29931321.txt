 Methyl salicylate ( MeSA) is a long-distance signal transduction chemical that plays an important role in plant responses to abiotic stress and herbivore and pathogen attacks. However , it is unclear how photosynthesis and elicitation of plant volatile organic compounds ( VOC) from different metabolic pathways respond to the dose of MeSA. We applied different MeSA concentrations ( 0-50 mM) to study how exogenous MeSA alters VOC profiles of silver birch ( Betula pendula Roth) leaves from application through recovery ( 0.5-23 h). Methyl salicylate application significantly reduced net assimilation rate in 10 mM and 20 mM MeSA-treated plants. No significant effects of MeSA were observed on the stomatal conductance at any MeSA concentration. Methyl salicylate elicited emissions of benzenoids ( BZ) , monoterpenes ( MT) and fatty acid derived compounds ( LOX products). Emission rates of BZ were positively , but emission rates of MT were negatively correlated with MeSA concentration. Total emission of LOX products was not influenced by MeSA concentration. Emission rate of MT was negatively correlated with BZ and the share of MT in the total emission blend decreased and the share of BZ increased with increasing MeSA concentration. Although the share of LOX products was similar across MeSA treatments , some LOX products responded differently to MeSA concentration , ultimately resulting in unique VOC blends. Overall , this study demonstrates inverse responses of MT and BZ to different MeSA doses such that plant defense mechanisms induced by lower MeSA doses mainly lead to enhanced MT synthesis , whereas greater MeSA doses trigger BZ-related defense mechanisms. Our results will contribute to improving the understanding of birch defenses induced upon regular herbivore attacks and pathogen infections in boreal forests.
