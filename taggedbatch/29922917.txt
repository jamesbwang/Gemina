 Malaria<disease> is a common and sometimes fatal disease caused by infection with Plasmodium<pathogen><disease> parasites. Cerebral malaria<disease> ( CM) is a most severe complication of infection with Plasmodium<pathogen><disease> falciparum<pathogen><disease> parasites which features a complex immunopathology that includes a prominent neuroinflammation. The experimental mouse model of cerebral malaria<disease> ( ECM) induced by infection with Plasmodium<pathogen><disease> berghei ANKA has been used abundantly to study the role of single genes , proteins and pathways in the pathogenesis of CM , including a possible contribution to neuroinflammation. In this review , we discuss the Plasmodium<pathogen><disease> berghei ANKA infection model to study human CM , and we provide a summary of all host genetic effects ( mapped loci , single genes) whose role in CM pathogenesis has been assessed in this model. Taken together , the reviewed studies document the many aspects of the immune system that are required for pathological inflammation<symptom> in ECM , but also identify novel avenues for potential therapeutic intervention in CM and in diseases which feature neuroinflammation.
