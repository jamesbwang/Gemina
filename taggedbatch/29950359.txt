 Up to 20 % of hospitalised patients may have low serum phosphate concentrations. In certain groups , such as patients with chronic alcohol overconsumption , severe trauma or sepsis<disease> , the prevalence may be 30 % -50 %. Profound hypophosphataemia is less common , but may lead to severe<symptom> physiological disturbances. In rare cases , hypophosphataemia is caused by phosphaturic substances excreted from a tumour. Osteomalacia with chronic bone pain and fractures , as well as muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> , is common in such patients. The tumours are often small and difficult to detect. Studies suggest that fibroblast growth factor 23 is a reliable marker for detection of these tumours. Persistent hypophosphatemia unresponsive to supplements should raise clinical alertness. With complete resection of the neoplasm , the symptoms rapidly reverse. If the tumour can not be removed , treatment relies on supplementation with phosphate and active vitamin D compounds. We present a case report of a patient with severe hypophosphataemia , osteomalacia , dysphagia<symptom> and malnutrition.
