 Obesity is a significant health issue in the United States that both clinical and public health systems struggle to address. Electronic health record data could help support multi-sectoral interventions to address obesity. Standards have been identified and created to support the electronic exchange of weight-related data across many stakeholder groups. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiated a public-private partnership including government , industry , and academic technology partners to develop workflow scenarios and supporting systems to exchange weight-related data through standard transactions. This partnership tested the transmission of data using this newly-defined Healthy Weight ( HW) profile at multiple health data interoperability demonstration events. Five transaction types were tested by 12 partners who demonstrated how the standards and related systems support end-to-end workflows around managing weight-related issues in the community. The standard transactions were successfully tested at two Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise ( IHE) Connectathon events through 86 validated tests encompassing 38 multi-partner transactions. We have successfully demonstrated the transactions defined in the HW profile with a public-private partnership. These tested IT products and HW standards could be used to support a continuum of care around health related issues encompassing both health care and public health functions. The use of the HW profile , including a set of transactions and identified standards to implement those transactions , in IT products is a helpful first step in leveraging health information technology to address weight-related issues in the United States. Future work is needed to expand the use of these standards and to assess their use in real world settings.
