 Intestinal-type adenocarcinoma of the primary salivary glands is extremely rare. So far , only 11 cases of primary intestinal-type adenocarcinoma of the oral cavity and major salivary glands have been reported. Two of those tumors arose in the floor of mouth<symptom> , 7 in the tongue , and 2 in the major salivary glands. However , it has remained unclear whether these tumors are derived from mature salivary glands , and primary intestinal-type adenocarcinoma of the buccal mucosa has not been reported previously. Here , we present the first documented case of primary intestinal-type adenocarcinoma arising in a minor salivary gland of the buccal mucosa. Histopathologically , the tumor resembled a well-differentiated or mucinous colonic adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemically , the tumor cells were diffusely positive for AE1/AE3 , CAM5 .2 , CK7 , SATB2 , Î²-catenin , p53 , Ki-67 , MUC2 , and MUC5 AC. CK14 and CK20 were positive in some of the tumor cells. CDX2 , CA19-9 , SP-A , TTF-1 , PSA , SMA , p63 , and cyclin D1 were negative in the tumor cells. The tumor in the present case may have originated from salivary gland duct epithelium that underwent transformation to phenotypic intestinal-type epithelium. In this very rare case of primary intestinal-type adenocarcinoma of the buccal mucosa , we considered diagnostic markers that could be indicative of mature salivary gland origin.
