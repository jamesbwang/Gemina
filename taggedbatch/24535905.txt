 Hypoxia-inducible factor-2α ( HIF-2α) plays an important role in tumor progression and metastasis. A number of studies have evaluated the correlation between HIF-2α overexpression and clinical outcome in cancer patients but yielded inconsistent results. To comprehensively and quantitatively summarize the evidence on the capability of HIF-2α to predict the prognosis of cancer patients with solid tumors , a meta-analysis was carried out. Renal cell carcinoma ( CC-RCC) was separately analyzed due to an alternative mechanism of regulation. Systematic literature searches were performed in PubMed and Embase databases for relevant original articles until February 2018. Forty-nine studies with 6,052 patients were included in this study. The pooled hazard ratios ( HRs) with corresponding confidence intervals were calculated to assess the prognostic value of HIF-2α protein expression in tumor cells. The meta-analysis revealed strong significant negative associations between HIF-2α expression and five endpoints: overall survival ( HR = 1.69 , 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI) 1.39-2.06) , disease-free survival ( HR = 1.87 , 95 % CI 1.2-2.92) , disease-specific survival ( HR = 1.57 , 95 % CI 1.06-2.34) , metastasis-free survival ( HR = 2.67 , 95 % CI 1.32-5.38) , and progression-free survival ( HR = 2.18 , 95 % CI 1.25-3.78). Subgroup analyses revealed similar associations in the majority of tumor sites. Overall , these data demonstrate a negative prognostic role of HIF-2α in patients suffering from different types of solid tumors.
