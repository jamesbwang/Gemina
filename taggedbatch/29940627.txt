 The severe form of retroplacental hematoma is a serious accident in the second stage of pregnancy and at birth with frightening for the mother and fetus that often lead to death. The pathological mechanism presumes conditions for a `` special ground '' capital for the `` efficiency '' of the acute intradecidual vascular accident with the rupture of the uterus-placental arterioles. The complete clinical picture of this severe form of retroplacental hematoma- the placental abruption , observed and mentioned by the classics ( vascular drama of Couvelaire) consists of five syndromes<disease><symptom> , 18 signs and symptoms , four paradoxes , phenomena not fully met in the other forms of retroplacental hematoma ( minor and intermediate). The rate of incidence of retroplacental hematoma is in between 0.13-1.38 % and depends on the environment , on the socio-economic and medical conditions , on the `` obstetric education '' and associated pathology. Our study aims at re-evaluating the clinico-paraclinical phenomenon imposed by the dramatism of the phenomenon of in utero placental apoplexy , the impact on neonatal mortality and on the functional prognosis from the point of view of surgical climax.
