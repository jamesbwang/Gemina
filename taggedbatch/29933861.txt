 Cytokines are fundamental elements in mediating and stimulating the immune response against tuberculosis<disease> ( TB). Growing evidence indicated that polymorphisms in the interleukin-17 ( IL-17) A<pathogen> and F genes are implicated in TB. This meta-analysis was aimed to re-evaluate and update the relationship between IL-17A rs2275913 G/A and IL17F rs763780 T/C polymorphisms and TB risk. Using inclusive searches of the PubMed , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Web of Science and Elsevier Science Direct , we identified outcome data from all articles estimating the association between IL-17 A and F polymorphisms and TB risk. A total of 15 studies comprising 7130 patients and 7540 controls were included. Our pooled analysis demonstrated that the IL-17A rs2275913 G/A SNP was not associated with the risk of TB in overall , or in Asians and Caucasians , but it conferred resistance to TB in Latin Americans using allele ( OR = 0.53) , codominant ( OR = 0.53 and 0.38) , dominant ( OR = 0.49) and recessive ( OR = 0.46) inheritance models. For IL-17F rs763780 T/C , the pooled evidence indicated that this variation was a risk factor for TB in allele ( C vs T) and dominant ( TC+CC vs TT) models in overall ( OR of 1.35) and among Asians ( OR = 1.40) , but not in Caucasians. In summary , our meta-analysis suggested that the IL-17A rs2275913 was a protective factor against TB , but -17 F rs763780 T/C was a risk factor for TB.
