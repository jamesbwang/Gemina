 Occupational and environmental exposures to industrial chemicals are known to cause hepatotoxicity and liver injury , in humans and in animal models. Historically , research has focused on severe<pathogen><disease><symptom> acute liver injury ( e.g. fulminant liver failure) or endstage diseases ( e.g. cirrhosis and HCC). However , it has become recently recognized that toxicants can cause more subtle changes to the liver. For example , toxicant-associated steatohepatitis , characterized by hepatic steatosis , and inflammation<symptom> , was recently recognized in an occupational cohort exposed to vinyl chloride. At high occupational levels , toxicants are sufficient to cause liver damage and disease even in healthy subjects with no comorbidities for liver injury. However , it is still largely unknown how exposure to toxicants initiate and possibly more importantly exacerbate liver disease , when combined with other factors , such as underlying non-alcoholic fatty liver disease caused by poor diet and/or obesity. With better understanding of the mechanism ( s) and risk factors that mediate the initiation and progression of toxicant-induced liver disease , rational targeted therapy can be developed to better predict risk , as well as to treat or prevent this disease. The purpose of this review is to summarize established and proposed mechanisms of volatile organic compound-induced liver injury and to highlight key signaling events known or hypothesized to mediate these effects.
