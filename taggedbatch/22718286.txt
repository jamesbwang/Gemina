 ( Purpose) The objective of this research was to examine the impact of cognitive load on the flexion relaxation phenomenon ( FRP) during trunk flexion and return from flexion task. ( Subjects and Methods) Twenty-two healthy subjects ( 18 males , 4 females) participated in the study. Each participant was exposed to 3 experimental conditions: no cognitive task , easy cognitive task and difficult cognitive task. Surface electromyography was used to measure lumbar erector spinae muscles activity level. Flexion relaxation ratio ( FRR) was compared in order to assess the differences between the three experimental conditions during flexion and extension ( FLX FRR and EXT FRR). ( Results) The FRR was decreased with increase in cognitive difficulty; the difficult cognitive task was associated with significant lower value of FLX FRR in both sides. However , these changes were not significant in easy cognitive task. In addition , the EXT FRR was decreased in cognitive task conditions , but these results were not statistically significant except for difficult cognitive task condition in comparison to no cognitive task condition in left side. ( Conclusion) These findings suggest that cognitive loading can affect FRP in healthy subjects.
