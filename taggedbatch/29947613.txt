 In this work , we develop multicellular models of healthy and cancerous human soft<disease> tissues , which are used to investigate energy deposition in subcellular targets , quantify the microdosimetric spread in a population of cells , and determine how these results depend on model details. Monte Carlo ( MC) tissue models combining varying levels of detail on different length scales are developed: microscopically-detailed regions of interest ( > 1500 explicitly-modelled cells) are embedded in bulk tissue phantoms irradiated by photons ( 20 keV to 1.25 MeV). Specific energy ( < i > z </ i >; energy imparted per unit mass) is scored in nuclei and cytoplasm compartments using the EGSnrc user-code egs_chamber; specific energy mean , < < i > z </ i > > , standard deviation , < i > σ </ i > < sub > < i > z </ i > </ sub > , and distribution , < i > f </ i > ( < i > z </ i > , < i > D </ i >) , are calculated for a variety of macroscopic doses , < i > D </ i >. MC-calculated < i > f </ i > ( < i > z </ i > , < i > D </ i >) are compared with normal distributions having the same mean and standard deviation. For mGy doses , there is considerable variation in energy deposition ( microdosimetric spread) throughout a cell population: < i > e </ i >. < i > g </ i >. , for 30 keV photons irradiating melanoma with 7.5 μm cell radius and 3 μm nuclear radius , < i > σ </ i > < sub > < i > z </ i > </ sub >/ < < i > z </ i > > for nuclear targets is 170 % , and the fraction of nuclei receiving no energy deposition , < i > f </ i > < sub > < i > z </ i > = 0 </ sub > , is 0.31 for a dose of 10 mGy. If cobalt-60 photons are considered instead , then < i > σ </ i > < sub > < i > z </ i > </ sub >/ < < i > z </ i > > decreases to 84 % , and < i > f </ i > < sub > < i > z </ i > = 0 </ sub > decreases to 0.036. These results correspond to randomly arranged cells with cell/nucleus sizes randomly sampled from a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1 μm. If cells are arranged in a hexagonal lattice and cell/nucleus sizes are uniform throughout the population , then < i > σ </ i > < sub > < i > z </ i > </ sub >/ < < i > z </ i > > decreases to 106 % and 68 % for 30 keV and cobalt-60 , respectively; < i > f </ i > < sub > < i > z </ i > = 0 </ sub > decreases to 0.25 and 0.00094 for 30 keV and cobalt-60 , respectively. Thus , specific energy distributions are sensitive to cell/nucleus sizes and their distributions: variations in specific energy deposited over a cell population are underestimated if targets are assumed to be uniform in size compared with more realistic variation in target size. Bulk tissue dose differs from < < i > z </ i > > for nuclei ( cytoplasms) by up to 21 % ( 12 %) across all cell/nucleus sizes , bulk tissues , and incident photon energies , considering a 50 mGy dose level. Overall , results demonstrate the importance of microdosimetric considerations at low doses , and indicate the sensitivity of energy deposition within subcellular targets to incident photon energy , dose level , elemental compositions , and microscopic tissue model.
