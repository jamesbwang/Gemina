 Research suggests that cognitive processing therapy ( CPT) may be a particularly well-suited intervention for trauma survivors who endorse self-blame; however , no study has examined the impact of self-blame on response to CPT. Accordingly , the current study compared response to CPT between two groups of veterans seeking residential treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD). In one group , participants endorsed low self-blame at pretreatment ( n = 133) and in the other group , participants endorsed high self-blame ( n = 133). Results from multilevel modeling analysis suggest that both groups experienced significant reductions in PTSD symptoms as measured by the PTSD Checklist , B = -1.58 , SE = 0.11; 95 % CI ( -1.78 , -1.37); t ( 1654) = -14.97 , p < .001. After controlling for pretreatment symptom severity and additional covariates , there was no difference in treatment response between the low- and high-self-blame groups , Time Ã— Self-blame interaction: B = 0.18 , SE = 0.12; 95 % CI = ( -0.06 , 0.42); t ( 1646) = 1.49 , p = .138. This suggests that CPT is an effective treatment for individuals exposed to trauma , regardless of level of self-blame.
