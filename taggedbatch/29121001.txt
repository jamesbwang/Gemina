 Each year in the United States , cigarette smoking causes an estimated 480,000 deaths , including approximately 41,000 deaths from secondhand smoke exposure among nonsmoking adults ( 1). Smoke-free policies protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke exposure , reduce the social acceptability of smoking , help in preventing youth and young adult smoking initiation , and increase smokers ' efforts to quit smoking ( 1,2). Given that 99 % of adult cigarette smokers first start smoking before age 26 years and many smokers transition to regular , daily use during young adulthood ( 2) , * colleges and universities represent an important venue for protecting students , faculty , staff members , and guests from secondhand smoke exposure through tobacco control policies ( 3). To assess smoke-free and tobacco-free policies in U.S. colleges and universities , CDC and the American Nonsmokers ' Rights Foundation ( ANRF) determined the number of campuses nationwide that completely prohibit smoking ( smoke-free) or both smoking and smokeless tobacco product use ( tobacco-free) in all indoor and outdoor areas. As of November 2017 , at least 2,082 U.S. college and university campuses had smoke-free policies. Among these campuses , 1,743 ( 83.7 %) were tobacco-free; 1,658 ( 79.6 %) specifically prohibited electronic cigarette ( e-cigarette) use; and 854 ( 41.0 %) specifically prohibited hookah smoking. Smoke-free and tobacco-free policies on college and university campuses can help reduce secondhand smoke exposure , tobacco use initiation , and the social acceptability of tobacco use ( 1-3).
