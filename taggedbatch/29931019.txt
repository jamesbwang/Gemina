 A unified approach to access Nβ-protected amino alkyl isothiocyanates using Nβ-protected amino alkyl azides through a general strategy of Staudinger/aza-Wittig reaction is described. The type of protocol used to access isothiocyanates depends on the availability of precursors and also , especially in the amino acid chemistry , on the behavior of other labile groups towards the reagents used in the protocols; fortunately , we were not concerned about both these factors as precursor-azides were prepared easily by standard protocols , and the present protocol can pave the way for accessing title compounds without affecting Boc , Cbz and Fmoc protecting groups , and benzyl and tertiary butyl groups in the side chains. The present strategy eliminates the need for the use of amines to obtain title compounds and thus , this method is step-economical; additional advantages include retention of chirality , convenient handling and easy purification. A few hitherto unreported compounds were also prepared , and all final compounds were completely characterized by IR , mass , optical rotation , and 1H and 13C NMR studies.
