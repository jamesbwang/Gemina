 Urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> are common infections that can be caused by many bacterial pathogens. The susceptibility of such pathogens to antimicrobial agents is identified by different methods including disk diffusion test , direct sensitivity testing and determination minimum inhibitory concentration. The present study was conducted to isolate and identify bacteria cultured from urine samples and compare the results of direct sensitivity test ( DST) against Kirby-Bauer 's disk diffusion antimicrobial sensitivity ( AST) with respect to reliability , time and cost. Midstream urine samples were inoculated on blood and MacConkey agar plates; growth was evaluated after colony counting. We identified isolates based on their cultural and biochemical properties , and Vitek We tested 373 urine samples , of them 257 ( 68.9 %) were from females and 116 ( 31.1 %) from males. Primary cultivation detected growth ( > 10 None
