 To assess long-term functional and oncologic outcomes of prostate sparing cystectomy ( PSC) as a sexuality-preserving alternative to radical cystectomy in a selected group of bladder cancer ( BC) patients. Between 1995 and 2014 , 185 BC patients underwent PSC according to one of two standardized procedures at two centers. All patients had received extensive evaluation to rule out prostate cancer and BC at the bladder neck and prostatic urethra ( PU) , including prostate specific antigen blood analysis , transrectal ultrasound and/or prostate biopsies , PU biopsies and/or PU frozen section analysis. All patients received an orthotopic ileal neobladder. Overall survival ( OS) was assessed by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Cumulative incidence of cancer specific mortality , any recurrence and loco-regional recurrence were calculated using competing-risk methods. Finally , functional outcomes ( voiding , continence and erectile function) were evaluated. 185 patients ( cTa-3N0M0) with a mean age of 57 years ( SD: 9) were included. Median follow-up was 7.5 years ( IQR: 5.6-10.8). Five-year OS was 71 % and 5-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was 31 %. Twenty patients ( 10.8 %) had a loco-regional recurrence , two recurrences were in the PU. During follow-up , prostate cancer was detected in six patients ( 3.2 %). Erectile function was preserved in 86.1 % of patients , complete daytime and nighttime continence in 95.6 % and 70.2 % , respectively. This two-center study shows that in men with BC in whom the prostate and PU were proven free of malignancy , PSC would represent a valid treatment option with excellent functional outcome. Oncologic outcomes were comparable to what is known from radical cystoprostatectomy series.
