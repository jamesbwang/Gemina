 We evaluated genetic variability of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) situated in the CYP2E1 gene promoter in alcoholics. We also compared 1000 Genomes Project of CYP2E1 polymorphisms with frequencies of genotypes and haplotypes. Eight variation points were exclusively found in Brazilians. The allelic distributions of the rs3813867 , rs2031920 and rs2031921 polymorphisms in the CYP2E1 showed that the wild alleles ( G , C , T , respectively) had higher frequencies in both groups , alcoholic ( 96 % , 96 % , 96 %) and a control group ( 95.8 % , 94.9 % , 94.9 %) , when compared to the mutated allele ( C , T , C , respectively). The variation points , rs3813867 , rs2031920 and rs2031921 showed strong linkage disequilibrium ( LOD â‰¥ 2 , D ' = 1). South Asian populations presented larger LD blocks compared to the other populations. Our results showed that the allelic frequencies were markedly different among ethnicities and have contributed to the knowledge regarding the distribution among ethnic groups , being associated to alcohol consumption worldwide.
