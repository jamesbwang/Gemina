 Human<pathogen><disease> immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency<disease> syndrome<disease><symptom> ( HIV/AIDS) is associated with an increased prevalence of some malignancies. However , some observational studies have revealed an ever-decreasing prevalence of HIV<pathogen> in glioma patients. The relationship between HIV<pathogen> and brain gliomas has not been well established. A cross-sectional study was carried out in sub-Sahara Africa , a high HIV<pathogen> prevalence setting , to determine the prevalence of HIV<pathogen> among all glioma patients over a 2-year period. A markedly reduced prevalence of HIV<pathogen> was found in glioma patients ( 8.3 %) in comparison to the general population ( 14.3 %). The presumably `` antiglioma effect '' of HIV<pathogen> and/or its treatment resulted in a 42 % decrease in glioma occurrence in HIV<pathogen> positive patients compared to HIV<pathogen> negative individuals. Age and sex-adjusted prevalence were also lower among glioma patients with the protective effect observed more in younger patients and female sex. Our results corroborate the protective effect of HIV<pathogen> positivity vis-Ã - vis gliomas. This `` antiglioma effect '' could be attributed to either the HIV<pathogen> , its treatment , or both. Future studies focused on this `` effect '' may help unveil better preventative and possible therapeutic avenues for gliomas.
