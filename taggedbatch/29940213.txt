 Olfactory ensheathing cells ( OECs) migrate from olfactory epithelium towards olfactory bulb ( OB) , contributing to formation of the presumptive olfactory nerve layer during development. However , it remains unclear that molecular mechanism of regulation of OEC migration in OB. In the present study , we found that OECs highly expressed the receptors of semaphorin 3A ( Sema3A) in vitro and in vivo , whereas Sema3A displayed a gradient expression pattern with higher in inner layer of OB and lower in outer layer of OB. Furthermore , the collapse assays , Boyden chamber migration assays and single-cell migration assays showed that Sema3A induced the collapse of leading front of OECs and inhibited OEC migration. Thirdly , the leading front of OECs exhibited adaptation in a protein synthesis-independent manner , and endocytosis-dependent manner during Sema3A-induced OEC migration. Finally , Sema3A-induced collapse of leading front was required the decrease of focal adhesion and a retrograde F-actin flow in a cofilin activation-dependent manner. Taken together , these results demonstrate that Sema3A as an inhibitive migratory factor for OEC migration through cofilin activation is involved in the formation of olfactory nerve layer.
