 To screen the toxic polar fractions of Daphne genkwa , compare the toxicity of D. genkwa on crypts epithelial cells IEC-6 before and after vinegar processing , and preliminarily investigate the mechanism of D. genkwa vinegar processing on toxicity reducing. The proliferation of IEC-6 cells was observed by MTT. The levels of superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , malondialdehyde ( MDA) , glutathione ( GSH) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) , as well as the enzyme activity of Na ⁺- K ⁺- ATPase and Ca ² ⁺- Mg ² ⁺- ATPase were determined in IEC-6 cells to evaluate the oxidative damages degree of IEC-6 cells. The apoptosis and cell cycle were analyzed by Flow Cytometry. The results showed that the dichloromethane extraction was the toxic polar fraction of D. genkwa , and after vinegar processing , the toxicity of dichloromethane fraction was significantly reduced (
