 In 2012 , the Chinese government launched a nationwide reform of county-level public hospitals with the goal of controlling the rapid growth of healthcare expenditure. The key components of the reform were the zero markup drug policy ( ZMDP) , which removed the previously allowed 15 % markup for drug sales at public hospitals , and associated increases in fees for medical services. By exploiting the temporal and cross-sectional variations in the policy implementation and using a unique , nationally representative hospital-level dataset in 1880 counties between 2009 and 2014 , we find that the policy change led to a reduction in drug expenditures , a rise in expenditures for medical services , and no measurable changes in total health expenditures. However , we also find an increase in expenditures for diagnostic tests/medical consumables at hospitals that had a greater reliance on drug revenues before the reform , which is unintended by policymakers. Further analysis shows that these results were more likely to be driven by the supply side , suggesting that hospitals offset the reductions in drug revenues by increasing the provision of services and products with higher price-cost margins. These findings hold lessons for cost containment policies in both developed and developing countries.
