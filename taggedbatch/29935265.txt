 To report a case of pelvic angiosarcoma in a 27-year-old man with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome<disease><symptom> ( LFS) and evaluate the presentation and timeline of genitourinary ( GU) tract involvement in LFS patients. We retrospectively identified 39 LFS patients treated at our institution between 2000 and 2014; 7 ( 18 %) had experienced a GU malignancy or an LFS-related malignancy involving the GU tract. Clinical characteristics , including dates of onset of first GU tract malignancies; pathologic findings; multimodal management; and familial history of LFS were reviewed. Median age at first malignancy was 14.0 years ( interquartile range ( IQR) 5.5-24.0). There was a slight male predominance ( 4 of 7). Median time between first malignancy and the malignancy involving the GU tract was 10.1 years ( IQR 8.0-19.5). Six of the 7 patients ( 86 %) had a form of sarcoma<disease> involving the GU tract; 1 developed adrenocortical carcinoma. The cancer pedigree of all patients showed LFS-associated malignancies in family members. Multimodal management included surgical resection in 6 patients with adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy in 1 patient each. One patient received chemotherapy only. Following diagnosis of malignancy involving the GU tract , 5 of the 7 patients developed additional primary malignancies. At a median follow-up of 4.7 years ( IQR 3.0-12.1) , 2 patients are alive , 3 died of disease , and 1 died of unknown cause. One patient was lost at follow-up. Continued follow-up of LFS cancer patients aimed at the determination of optimal screening , management , and surveillance protocols is recommended and may result in longer survival expectations.
