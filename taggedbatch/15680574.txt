 Liver glomus tumor is very rare , and only 6 cases have been reported. Herein , we report another case of liver glomus tumor and the clinicopathological features are summarized. An 18-year-old male patient was admitted due to hypertension and arrhythmia for 4 days. Abdominal enhanced CT revealed a 6.0-cm solid and cystic mass in the left liver lobe. The mass was collected by hepatic lobectomy. Microscopically , the tumor cells were round or oval , and had no malignant features and no evident atypia. Immumohistochemically , tumor cells were positive for positive for SMA and vimentin , but partially positive for syn , CD34 and desmin. He was pathologically diagnosed with liver glomus tumor. The patient underwent a left hepatic lobectomy. After surgery , this patient was followed up for 6 months , and metastasis/recurrence was not observed. Primary liver glomus tumor has no specific clinical manifestations , and imaging examinations have limitations for its diagnosis. Immunostaining for SMA and vimentin is necessary to prove the diagnosis. Complete resection is strongly advised and it has a favorable prognosis.
