 To solve the hidden danger of high methane and low permeability gas in the coal mining process , potentially affecting the safety production in an orderly way , we propose the use of deep hole blasting technology to improve the permeability of the coal seam gas drainage , increase the quantity and rate of extraction , and reduce methane output. Taking the geological conditions of the 201 working surface of Tingnan Coal Mine as an example , it is calculated that the single drilled fracture crack extension range is 3.11 ~ 5.24 m according to the coal seam deep-hole pre-splitting blasting joint mechanism and fracture propagation mechanics model , providing a theoretical basis for choosing the appropriate hole spacing. Using COMSOL simulation software to simulate the effective gas drainage radius of a coal seam from a two-dimensional perspective on a single borehole radial , the least squares fitting method was used to analyze the simulated data , and obtained the effective drilling extraction radius after pre-split blasting in a deep hole that is 3.6 m , which is in accordance with the theoretical calculations. In order to obtain accurate and scientific calculations , Fast lagrangian analysis of continua ( FLAC3D) numerical simulation software was used. After simulating the distribution of plastic zone between two blast holes at different intervals from a three-dimensional angle , and evaluating the development of cracks in the blasting hole , the white zone of the blasting space was completely eliminated when the interval between blasting holes was 7 m , and the cracks could be propagated throughout the surroundings. Therefore , a blasting hole spacing of 7 m is optimal. On-site monitoring in the Nanting coal mine showed that the quantity and rate of extraction of the single hole after pre-splitting blasting were 2.36 times and 1.62 times as much as before. By integrating the borehole drainage amount and the optimized calculation equation , it could be concluded that the permeability coefficient of the coal seam after blasting was 7.78 times as much as before. The function of time-variated drilling methane emission was obtained using multivariate statistical regressions based on the on-site monitored borehole methane emission ( qt) , and the drilling limit after pre-splitting blasting revealed that the limitation of methane extraction volume was 5.27 times as much as before.
