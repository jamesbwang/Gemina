 In this experiment , corn stover was treated with optimal combined pretreatment conditions: 2 % NaOH at 80 & deg; C treated 2 h combined with initial pH 9 at the ozone concentration of 78 mg/mL treated 25 min. The effect of lignin removal rate on the enzymatic hydrolysis degree of cellulose during the treatment process was studied. At the same time , the lignin in the optimal pretreated corn stover was separated and extracted by enzymatic acidolysis , and its structure and connection were characterized. The results showed that the alkali combined with ozone pretreatment improved the enzymatic hydrolysis degree of the cellulose while exfoliating and degrading the macromolecular lignin into small molecules. The stable crosslink structure of the lignin-cellulose-hemicellulose was destroyed , and the lignocellulosic structure changed in favor of the enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellulose.
