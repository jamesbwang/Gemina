 This in vivo study aims to investigate the effects of curcumin which is recently developed for tendon healing using a rat Achilles tendon injury model. Eighteen male Wistar albino rats weighing 300-400 g were used in this study. Under anesthesia , Achilles tendon injuries were created and repaired surgically. Nine rats of the study group received curcumin ( suspended in saline at a dose of 200 mg/kg orally) and eight rats of the control group received only saline solution by oral gavage for a period of 28 days. Animals were euthanized on the 28th post-operative day , and all the Achilles tendons were removed and transferred immediately for biomechanic and histological analysis. Macroscopically , all the tendons were fully healed. Total mean Bonar score was higher in the control group. When the parameters of Bonar score were analysed separately , tenocyte morphology , collogen , and ground substance scores were statistically lower than the control group ( p = 0.03 , 0.041 , 0.049 , respectively). Vascularity parameter did not show any statistical difference ( p > 0.05). Of the nine biomechanical parameters , five of them ( failure load , cross-sectional area , length , ultimate stress , strain) showed better results which were also statistically significant ( p = 0.046 , 0.027 , 0.011 , 0.021 , 0.002 , respectively). When the remaining four parameters were examined , the study group also had better results , but this difference was not statistically significant. Curcumin had better results for total tendon healing not only histologically but also biomechanically. Curcumin could be an additional agent in the management of surgically repaired tendon injuries.
