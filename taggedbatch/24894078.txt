 Computerised decision support ( CDS) based on trustworthy clinical guidelines is a key component of a learning healthcare system. Research shows that the effectiveness of CDS is mixed. Multifaceted context , system , recommendation and implementation factors may potentially affect the success of CDS interventions. This paper describes the development of a checklist that is intended to support professionals to implement CDS successfully. We developed the checklist through an iterative process that involved a systematic review of evidence and frameworks , a synthesis of the success factors identified in the review , feedback from an international expert panel that evaluated the checklist in relation to a list of desirable framework attributes , consultations with patients and healthcare consumers and pilot testing of the checklist. We screened 5347 papers and selected 71 papers with relevant information on success factors for guideline-based CDS. From the selected papers , we developed a 16-factor checklist that is divided in four domains , i.e. the CDS context , content , system and implementation domains. The panel of experts evaluated the checklist positively as an instrument that could support people implementing guideline-based CDS across a wide range of settings globally. Patients and healthcare consumers identified guideline-based CDS as an important quality improvement intervention and perceived the GUIDES checklist as a suitable and useful strategy. The GUIDES checklist can support professionals in considering the factors that affect the success of CDS interventions. It may facilitate a deeper and more accurate understanding of the factors shaping CDS effectiveness. Relying on a structured approach may prevent that important factors are missed.
