 Adolescence is thought of as a stress-sensitive developmental period. While many studies have compared adolescent responses to stress relative to that of adults , a growing body of work has examined stress responses in juveniles. Here we investigated if a chronic stressor has a differential effect on spatial memory in rats depending on whether it occurs during adolescence or the juvenile period. Male rats were exposed to the stress hormone corticosterone ( Cort) in their drinking water , a vehicle control ( 2.5 % ethanol) , or water , for 7 days before being tested on a novel Object/Place task 6 days or 6 weeks later. Exposure to Cort or ethanol at either age impaired spatial memory at the 6-day test. The ethanol induced impairment was attenuated 6 weeks later. However , rats given Cort during adolescence , but not the juvenile period , were still impaired. Together , these results suggest that adolescence is indeed a stress-sensitive period.
