 We aimed to investigate the impact of early versus late discharge following cesarean delivery ( CD) on re-admission rate. This is a retrospective cohort study of all CDs performed between 2013 and 2016. Patients who underwent CD between 01/13 and 12/14 , were routinely discharged on postoperative day ( POD) 3 ( early discharge) and were defined as T1 group. Patients who had CD between 01/15 and 12/16 were routinely discharged on POD 4 ( late discharge) and were defined as T2 group. Data on re-admission rate and postpartum complications were compared between the groups. As compared to the T2 group ( n = 1856) , less patients in the T1 group ( n = 2020) had â‰¥ 2 previous CDs ( 13 vs. 15.6 % , respectively; p = 0.02). The T1 group had shorter operative time as compared to the T2 group ( p < 0.001). Postoperative complications and re-admission rates were similar between the groups. By logistic regression analysis model only intrapartum complications ( RR = 7.87 , CI 2.45-25.26 , p < 0.001) and prolonged labor ( RR = 3.68 , CI 1.44-9.39 , p = 0.006) were found to be independently associated with postpartum re-admission. Early discharge after CD ( POD 3) seems to be as safe as a more delayed discharge.
