 This retrospective cohort study investigated the outcomes of patients with unplanned intensive care unit ( ICU) readmission.All of the patients readmitted to ICU within 48 hours between 2010 and 2016 were enrolled.A total of 99 patients early readmitted to ICU were identified and their mean age of the patients was 68.8 Â± 14.8 years. Respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> was the most common cause of ICU readmission ( n = 48 , 48.5 %) , followed by acute myocardial ischemia or worsening heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( n = 25 , 25.3 %) , sepsis<disease> ( n = 22 , 22.2 %) , gastrointestinal disease ( n = 16 , 16.2 %) , and neurologic disease ( n = 11 , 11.1 %). The median length of stay in the ICU and hospital was 7 ( IQR , 4-11.5) and 32 ( IQR , 15.5-48.5) days , respectively. A total of 34 patients died during the hospital stay and the rate of in-hospital mortality was 34.3 %. Patients with higher APACHE II scores ( adjusted odds ratio ( OR) , 1.17; 95 % CI , 1.02-1.33) , underlying malignancy ( adjusted OR , 4.70; 95 % CI , 1.19-18.57) , and cardiovascular organ dysfunction ( adjusted OR , 5.14; 95 % CI , 1.24-21.38) were more likely to die.The mortality rate of ICU readmission patients was high , especially for those with higher APACHE II score , underlying malignancy and cardiovascular organ dysfunction.
