 Vermilion flycatchers songs are composed of two acoustically different parts: a first part ( FP) containing a variable number of introductory elements , and a second part ( SP) composed of four elements. Previous work suggests that the FP is important for territorial competition and that it conveys information on threat level. By exposing free-living males to playbacks of complete songs ( CS 's) , FP 's and SP 's , we evaluated the relative contribution of each song part in males ' territorial responses. Males called in response to all three treatments , suggesting each song component is important for territorial competition. Males ' call response did not differ toward CS 's and FP 's , and toward CS 's and SP 's ( although a non-significant tendency was found for SP 's to elicit a weaker response than CS 's) , but it was greater toward FP 's than toward SP 's. These results , coupled with previous work , further support the idea that the FP plays a special role during territorial competition and may give information on level of threat. We further discuss our result in terms of mechanistic and functional hypotheses.
