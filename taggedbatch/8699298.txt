 To investigate the demographic features of labial adhesion ( LA) in South Korea. A population-based nationwide study. Census population of South Korea. With the entire population of South Korea ( n = 47 990 761) , patients under age 7 who were newly diagnosed with LA from January 2010 to December 2014 were included. The average incidence and the peak age of LA occurrence were estimated. A total of 4934 newly diagnosed LAs were analysed. The incidence of LA has constantly increased since 2008 , the year that the Korean Developmental Screening Test for InfantsandChildren registry began. The average incidence of LA was 55.0 cases/100 000 person-years ( 95 % CI 53.5 to 56.6). The highest incidence was 183.6 cases/100 000 person-years ( 95 % CI 175.8 to 191.6) in the age group of13 to 24 months. The relative risk of acquiring LA in the age group of 13 to 24 months was 1.481 ( 95 % CI 1.381 to 1.587) compared with the age group of 0 to 12 months. The demographic characteristics of LA including the average incidence and the highest incidence age group in South Korea were revealed in this nationwide , population-based study including a total of 4934 newly developed LA cases. Further studies are needed to reveal the natural disease course and the significance of diagnosing asymptomatic LA cases.
