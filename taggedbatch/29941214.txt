 This study addresses inactivation of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> in either 5- or 10-mL volumes , which were 50- to 100-fold greater than used in an earlier study ( Brayman et al. 2017). Cells were treated with 1-MHz pulsed high-intensity focused ultrasound ( 10 cycles , 2-kHz repetition frequency , +65/ -12.8 MPa focal pressures). The surviving fraction was assessed by coliform assay , and inactivation demonstrated curvilinear kinetics. The reduction of surviving fraction to 50 % required 2.5 or 6 min in 5- or 10-mL samples , respectively. Exposure of 5 mL for 20 min reduced the surviving fraction to ∼ 1 %; a similar exposure of 10-mL samples reduced the surviving fraction to ∼ 10 %. Surviving cells from 5-min exposures appeared normal under light microscopy , with minimal debris; after 20 min , debris dominated. Transmission electron microscopy images of insonated samples showed some undamaged cells , a few damaged but largely intact cells and comminuted debris. Cellular damage associated with substantive but incomplete levels of inactivation can be variable , ranging from membrane holes tens of nanometers in diameter to nearly complete comminution.
