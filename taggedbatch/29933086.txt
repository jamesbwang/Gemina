 Laser interstitial thermal therapy ( LITT) enables ablation of lesions<symptom> using thermal energy with minimal damage to surrounding regions. Bevacizumab has been used as an adjuvant therapy in recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM). At present , bevacizumab is administered at least 4-6 weeks after surgical intervention; however , given the minimally invasive nature of LITT , we suggest that bevacizumab can be safely administered at a shorter interval after LITT. Three patients who showed evidence of recurrent GBM on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) , underwent LITT , and were subsequently administered bevacizumab within 4 weeks were identified retrospectively. Postoperative MRI was performed 24 hours after treatment and before follow-up. All 3 patients were placed on dexamethasone taper postoperatively. The ablated tumors were analyzed radiographically , and bevacizumab symptoms were monitored carefully. The patients ranged in age from 39 to 69 years. The median duration of follow-up was 26 weeks ( range , 13-51 weeks). All 3 patients expired due to disease progression. The median progression-free survival ( PFS) was 17 weeks ( range , 12-22 weeks) , and the median overall survival ( OS) was 32 weeks ( range , 12-51 weeks). There were no postoperative complications or complications due to hemorrhage<symptom> , infection , or thrombosis ( complication rate , 0 %; 95 % confidence interval 0-56 %). This case series suggests that bevacizumab administration is safe within 1 month after LITT , thus showing promise in treating recurrent GBM. Larger studies are warranted to assess the efficacy of combined bevacizumab and LITT.
