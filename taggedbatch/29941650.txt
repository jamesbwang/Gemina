 Single amino-acid substitutions in the Ω-loop of KPC β-lactamases are known to lead to resistance to the ceftazidime-avibactam combination. Here , we investigate this mechanism of resistance in CTX-M enzymes , which are the most widely spread extended-spectrum β-lactamases worldwide. Nine single amino acid polymorphisms were identified in the Ω-loop of the 172 CTX-M sequences present in the Lahey database. The corresponding modifications were introduced in CTX-M-15 by site-directed mutagenesis. None of the nine substitutions was associated with ceftazidime-avibactam resistance in
