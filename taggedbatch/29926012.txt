 Although cisplatin-based chemotherapy shows a survival advantage compared to carboplatin for treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer , high-volume hydration and a long infusion time are necessary to avoid nephrotoxicity , and cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been difficult to administer in outpatient settings. A low-volume hydration method using mannitol or furosemide as forced diuresis was recently introduced , but there are no clear conclusions regarding which agent should be used. We describe our ongoing randomized phase II trial ( the OLCSG1406 Study) evaluating the efficacy of forced diuresis. This study will clarify whether mannitol or furosemide is more suitable in cisplatin-based chemotherapy with low-volume hydration.
