 The proteostasis machinery has critical functions in metabolically active cells such as neurons. Ubiquilins ( UBQLNs) may decide the fate of proteins , with its ability to bind and deliver ubiquitinated misfolded or no longer functionally required proteins to the ubiquitin-proteasome system ( UPS) and/or autophagy. Missense mutations in UBQLN2 have been linked to X-linked dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia ( ALS-FTD). Although aggregation-prone TAR DNA-binding protein 43 ( TDP-43) has been recognized as a major component of the ubiquitin pathology , the mechanisms by which UBQLN involves in TDP-43 proteinopathy have not yet been elucidated in detail. We previously characterized a new Drosophila Ubiquilin ( dUbqn) knockdown model that produces learning/memory and locomotive deficits during the proteostasis impairment. In the present study , we demonstrated that the depletion of dUbqn markedly affected the expression and sub-cellular localization of Drosophila TDP-43 ( TBPH) , resulting in a cytoplasmic ubiquitin-positive ( Ub
