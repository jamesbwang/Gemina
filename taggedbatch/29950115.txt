 Susceptibility to diabetes-induced bone complication has been linked to Wnt signaling , which plays an important role in bone development and remodeling. In this study , the effect of swim training on Wnt pathway in T2DM was investigated. Forty male rats were assigned to groups: control ( C) , diabetic ( D) , exercised control ( E) and diabetic exercised ( DE). One week after the induction of diabetes , animals were subjected to swim. At the end of training , bone gene and protein levels of SOST , RUNX2 and RANKL/OPG ratio were measured. Diabetes could significantly increase bone sclerostin expression levels , while decreased RUNX2 mRNA and protein. Bone RANKL/OPG ratio was significantly lower in diabetic rats compared to control group. Swim training significantly increased this ratio in DE compared to D group. Swim training could partially compensate the diabetes-associated changes of Wnt pathway possibly by moderating sclerostin or blood sugar.
