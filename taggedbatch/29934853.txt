 As an essential phosphate group hydrolase , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) , whose level in serum is correlated with bone disease , liver dysfunction , and cancer , could be used as a biomarker for clinical diagnosis and biomedical studies. Hence , developing a convenient and sensitive method for ALP assay has importance in disease diagnosis , drug treatment , and prognosis assessment. In this work , using a hairpin DNA strand as the substrate , we developed an ultrasensitive and simple fluorescence method for quantitative ALP assay based on the binding difference of reduced graphene oxide ( rGO) with different DNA strands coupled with λ exonuclease ( λ exo) cleavage. Under the optimal conditions , the limit of detection ( LOD) of ALP is estimated to be 0.01 U/L with the linear region from 0.5 U/L to 70 U/L. Furthermore , the proposed assay was used to detect ALP in complicated cell-free extracts and evaluate the inhibitory effects of two well-known inhibitors of ALP activity. Finally , the method was used to investigate the effect of natural compounds on ALP activity and five compounds with different inhibitory capability were screened. In summary , we propose that the new method for ALP assay can be applied for therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM) and high-throughput compound screening in combination with multiwell plate technology.
