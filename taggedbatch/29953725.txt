 Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is emerging as a central regulator in inflammatory processes , as documented by increasing studies reported in the literature. For instance , the activation of this nicotinic receptor subtype in resident macrophages inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines , thereby attenuating local inflammatory responses , and may open a new window in the treatment of chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> , such as Crohn 's disease , rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> , psoriasis , and asthma. In continuation of our ongoing research for the development of new cholinergic drug candidates , we selected the nicotine derivative CAP55 , which was previously shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects via nicotinic stimulation , as a suitable compound for lead optimization. Through the isosteric replacement of its 3,5-disubstituted 4,5-dihydroisoxazole core with a 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole ring , we could rapidly generate a small library of CAP55-related analogs via a one-pot copper ( I)- catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition. Receptor binding assays at nAChRs led to the identification of two promising derivatives , compounds 4 and 10 , worthy of further pharmacological studies.
