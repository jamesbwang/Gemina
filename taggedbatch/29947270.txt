 Parkinson 's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive and selective death of dopaminergic neurons. It has been reported that nicotine and morphine have protective roles during neuronal damage in Parkinson 's disease. In addition , the induction of cross-tolerance between their biological effects has been shown in numerous reports. Here , we investigated the effects of nicotine and morphine on 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line as an in vitro model of Parkinson 's disease. Cell damage was induced by 150 Î¼M 6-OHDA and the cells viability was examined by MTT assay. Intracellular reactive oxygen species , calcium level and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined by fluorescence spectrophotometer method. Biochemical markers of apoptosis were also evaluated by immunoblotting. The data showed that morphine and nicotine prevent 6-OHDA- induced cell damage and apoptosis. However , the protective effects of nicotine were not observed in chronic morphine-pretreated cells. Morphine had no protective effects in chronic nicotine-incubated cells. A cross-tolerance between protective effects of morphine and nicotine was occurred in 6-OHDA-induced SH-SY5Y cell toxicity.
