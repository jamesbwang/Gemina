 For semiconductors photosensitized with organic dyes or quantum dots , transferred electrons are usually considered thermalized at the conduction band edge. This study suggests that the electrons injected from a plasmonic metal into a thin semiconductor shell can be nonthermal with energy up to the plasmon frequency. In other words , the electrons injected into the semiconductor are still hot carriers. Photomodulated X-ray absorption measurements of the Ti L
