 Previous study has been reported that braykinin B2 receptor ( Bdkrb2) involves in high glucose-induced renal and podocytes injuries. However , there have been some studies with contradictory results that Bdkrb2 has a protective effect on hyperglycemia-induced injuries in vivo and in vitro. The purpose of the present study was carried out to further investigate the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of microRNA ( miR) in high glucose-treated podocytes by targeting Bdkrb2 signaling in vitro. The CCK-8 and flow cytometry were performed to measure the cell viability and apoptosis. Gene and protein expression were assayed by RT-qPCR and western blotting , respectively. High glucose treatment decreased cell viability and induced membrane and DNA damage , as well as apoptosis in podocytes. High glucose treatment also increased the expression of Bdkrb2 , which was blocked by miR-204-3p mimics transfection in podocytes. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter activity showed that miR-204-3p was directly targeted to the 3 '- untranslated region ( 3 '- UTR) of Bdkrb2. High glucose-induced apoptosis and dysfunction in podocytes were reserved by miR-204-3p mimics transfection , while the effects of miR-204-3p mimics in high glucose-treated podocytes were neutralized by overexpressed Bdkrb2. These findings suggested that miR-204-3p may play a protective role in high glucose-induced apoptosis and dysfunction in podocytes through down-regulation of Bdkrb2.
