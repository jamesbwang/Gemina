 IL-1α produced by Sertoli cells is considered to act as a growth factor for spermatogonia. In this study , we investigated the association of the C376A polymorphism in IL-1α with male infertility<symptom> in men referring to the Kashan IVF Center. In this case-control study , 2 ml of blood was collected from 230 fertile and 230 infertile men. After DNA extraction , the C376A variant was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP). In addition , the molecular effects of the C376A transversion were analysed using bioinformatics tools. A significant association was observed between the homozygous genotype CC with male infertility<symptom> ( odds ratio ( OR) = 1.97 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.14-3.41 , P = 0.016)). Carriers of C ( AC+CC) showed a similar risk for male infertility<symptom> ( OR = 1.78 , 95 % CI = 1.06-2.99 , P = 0.030). Also , allelic analysis showed that the C allele is associated with male infertility<symptom> ( OR = 1.43 , 95 % CI = 1.09-1.88 , P = 0.011). In sub-group analysis , we found that the AC genotype is associated with asthenozoospermia ( OR = 2.38 , 95 % CI = 1.03-5.53 , P = 0.043). In addition , carriers of C were at high risk for asthenozoospermia ( OR = 2.25 , 95 % CI = 1.01-4.10 , P = 0.047). Also , C allele was significantly associated with oligozoospermia ( OR = 1.44 , 95 % CI = 1.01-2.06 , P = 0.049) and non-obstructive azoospermia ( OR = 1.67 , 95 % CI = 1.04-2.68 , P = 0.034). Finally , in silico analysis showed that the C376A polymorphism could alter splicing especially in the acceptor site. This is the preliminary report on the association of IL-1α C376A polymorphism with male infertility<symptom> in the Kashan population. This association shows that the IL-1α gene may be a biomarker for male infertility<symptom> , and therefore needs additional investigations in future studies to validate this.
