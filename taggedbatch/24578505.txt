 Rapid global warming directly impacts agricultural productivity and poses a major challenge to the present-day agriculture. Recent climate change models predict severe<symptom> losses<symptom> in crop production worldwide due to the changing environment , and in wheat , this can be as large as 42 Mt/ Â°C rise in temperature. Although wheat occupies the largest total harvested area ( 38.8 %) among the cereals including rice and maize , its total productivity remains the lowest. The major production losses<symptom> in wheat are caused more by abiotic stresses such as drought , salinity , and high temperature than by biotic insults. Thus , understanding the effects of these stresses becomes indispensable for wheat improvement programs which have depended mainly on the genetic variations present in the wheat genome through conventional breeding. Notably , recent biotechnological breakthroughs in the understanding of gene functions and access to whole genome sequences have opened new avenues for crop improvement. Despite the availability of such resources in wheat , progress is still limited to the understanding of the stress signaling mechanisms using model plants such as
