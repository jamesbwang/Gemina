 Rufinamide ( RUF) is a structurally unique anti-epileptic drug , used in the treatment of seizure<symptom> disorders such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome<disease><symptom>. In the present study , we investigated whether RUF protected against excitotoxic neuronal damage in the mouse hippocampal CA3 region after intraperitoneal kainic acid ( KA) injection. Treatment with 25 , 50 and 100 mg/kg RUF significantly decreased the KA-induced neuronal death in the hippocampal CA3 region in a dose-dependent manner. In addition , 100 mg/kg RUF treatment reduced the KA-induced oxidative stress-related increase of MDA level and decrease of total SOD activity in the hippocampus. KA-induced increases of pro-inflammatory cytokines , TNF-α and IL-1β , levels as well as KA-induced microglial activation were also suppressed by RUF treatment. These results indicate that RUF displays a neuroprotective effect against KA-induced excitotoxic neuronal death in the mouse hippocampus through anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.
