 This review aims to summarize and discuss the recent findings in the field of using HDL mimetics for the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease. Following the largely disappointing results with the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors , focus moved to HDL functionality rather than absolute HDL cholesterol values. A number of HDL/apoA-I mimicking molecules were developed , aiming to enhance reverse cholesterol transport that has been associated with an atheroprotective effect. Three HDL mimetics have made the step from bench-testing to clinical trials in humans and are discussed here: apoA-I Milano , CSL-112 , and CER-001. Unfortunately , with the exception of CSL-112 where the results of the clinical trial are not yet known , none of the agents was able to demonstrate a clinical benefit. HDL mimetics have failed to date to prove a beneficial effect in clinical practice. Reverse cholesterol transport remains a challenging therapeutic pathway to be explored.
