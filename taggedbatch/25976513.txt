 Although there have been more than 100 clinical trials , CpG-based immunotherapy has been seriously hindered by complications in the immunosuppressive microenvironment of established tumors. Inspired by the decisive role of fever<symptom> upon systemic immunity , a photothermal CpG nanotherapeutics ( PCN) method with the capability to induce an immunofavorable tumor microenvironment by casting a fever-relevant heat ( 43 Â°C) in the tumor region is developed. High-throughput gene profile analysis identifies nine differentially expressed genes that are closely immune-related upon mild heat , accompanied by IL-6 upregulation , a pyrogenic cytokine usually found during fever<symptom>. When treated with intratumor PCN injection enabling mild heating in the tumor region , the 4T1 tumor-bearing mice exhibit significantly improved antitumor immune effects compared with the control group. Superb efficacy is evident from pronounced apoptotic cell death , activated innate immune cells , enhanced tumor perfusion , and intensified innate and adaptive immune responses. This work highlights the crucial role of mild heat in modulating the microenvironment in optimum for improved immunotherapy , by converting the tumor into an in situ vaccine.
