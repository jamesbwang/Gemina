 Capgras syndrome<disease><symptom> is one of a variety of delusional misidentification syndromes<disease><symptom> that can be associated with acute ischemic stroke , neurodegenerative disease , or metabolic conditions. Most cases reported in the literature are associated with frontal and/or parietal lobe involvement. Transient Capgras syndrome<disease><symptom> is rare but has been reported. We present a case of transient Capgras syndrome<disease><symptom> following bilateral cerebral ischemic infarcts in the frontal , parietal , and temporal regions , and involving the right prefrontal cortex. To our knowledge , transient Capgras syndrome<disease><symptom> with rapid resolution over a period of days is rare.
