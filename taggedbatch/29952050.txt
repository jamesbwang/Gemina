 Cotton fibers are single-celled trichomes that initiate from the epidermal cells of the ovules at or before anthesis. Here , we identified that the histone deacetylase ( HDAC) activity is essential for proper cotton fiber initiation. We further identified 15 HDACs homoeologs in each of the A- and D-subgenomes of Gossypium hirsutum. Few of these HDAC homoeologs expressed preferentially during the early stages of fiber development ( -1 , 0 and 6 days post-anthesis ( DPA)). Among them , GhHDA5 expressed significantly at the time of fiber initiation ( -1 and 0 DPA). The in vitro assay for HDAC activity indicated that GhHDA5 primarily deacetylates H3K9 acetylation marks. Moreover , the reduced expression of GhHDA5 also suppresses fiber initiation and lint yield in the RNA interference ( RNAi) lines. The 0 DPA ovules of GhHDA5RNAi lines also showed alterations in reactive oxygen species homeostasis and elevated autophagic cell death in the developing fibers. The differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) identified through RNA-seq of RNAi line ( DEP12) and their pathway analysis showed that GhHDA5 modulates expression of many stress and development-related genes involved in fiber development. The reduced expression of GhHDA5 in the RNAi lines also resulted in H3K9 hyper-acetylation on the promoter region of few DEGs assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The positively co-expressed genes with GhHDA5 showed cumulative higher expression during fiber initiation , and gene ontology annotation suggests their involvement in fiber development. Furthermore , the predicted protein interaction network in the positively co-expressed genes indicates HDA5 modulates fiber initiation-specific gene expression through a complex involving reported repressors.
