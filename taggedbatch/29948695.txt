 Spirotetramat is a pesticide with bidirectional systemicity in both xylem and phloem. Currently , researches show that spirotetramat has definite toxicity to aquatic organism. This paper aims to study the environmental behaviors of spirotetramat in water , in the hope of providing guidance for security evaluation of spirotetramat. The researches in this paper showed that under lighting condition , the half-life period of spirotetramat in water was 13.59 days. In water , spirotetramat could be degraded into B-enol and B-keto. As seen from the residual concentrations of two products , B-enol was the dominant degradation product. Under different temperatures , the hydrolysis products of spirotetramat remain B-enol and B-keto. The temperature has little effect on the residual concentration of spirotetramat in water. The residual concentration of B-enol in water gradually increased with the extension of time but B-keto had no significant change. In the buffer solution of different pH values , the degradation rate of spirotetramat was significantly enhanced with the increase of solution pH value. The hydrolysis products of spirotetramat in buffer solution of different pH values were still B-enol and B-keto , and pH exerted certain influence on the residual concentration of B-enol in water. The hydrolysis conversion of spirotetramat has theoretical and practical significance for the safe and reasonable usage of it , as well as for the further evaluation of spirotetramat 's ecological risk in water.
