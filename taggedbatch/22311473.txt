 Compartmentalized Janus microparticles advance many applications ranging from chemical synthesis to consumer electronics. Although these particles can be accurately manufactured using microfluidic droplet generators , the per-nozzle throughputs are relatively low ( ∼ μL/min). Here , we use `` in-air microfluidics '' to combine liquid microjets in midair , thereby enabling orders of magnitude faster production of Janus microparticles ( ∼ mL/min) as compared to chip-based microfluidics. Monodisperse Janus microparticles with diameters between 50 and 500 μm , tunable compartment sizes , and functional cargo are controllably produced. Furthermore , these microparticles are designed as magnetically steerable microreactors , which represents a novel tool to perform enzymatic cascade reactions within continuous fluid flows.
