 Construction of antibody-based , molecular-targeted optical imaging probes requires the labeling of an antibody with a fluorophore. The most common method for doing this involves non-specifically conjugating a fluorophore to an antibody , resulting in poorly defined , heterogeneous imaging probes that often have suboptimal in vivo behavior. We tested a new strategy to site-specific label antibody-based imaging probes using the SpyCatcher/SpyTag protein ligase system. We used the SpyCatcher/SpyTag protein ligase system to site specifically label nimotuzumab , an anti-EGFR antibody and an anti-HER3 diabody. To prevent the labeling from interfering with antigen binding , we introduced the SpyTag and SpyCatcher at the C-terminus of the antibody and diabody , respectively. Expression and binding properties of the C-terminal antibody-SpyTag and diabody-SpyCatcher fusions were similar to the antibody and diabody , indicating that the SpyTag and SpyCatcher fusions were well tolerated at this position. Site-specific labeling of the antibody and diabody was performed in two steps. First , we labeled the SpyCatcher with IRDye800CW-Maleimide and the SpyTag with IRDye800CW-NHS. Second , we conjugated the IRDye800CW-SpyCatcher and the IRDye800CW-SpyTag to the antibody or diabody , respectively. We confirmed the affinity and specificity of the IRDye800CW-labeled imaging probes using biolayer interferometry and flow cytometry. We analyzed the in vivo biodistribution and tumor accumulation of the IRDye800CW-labeled nimotuzumab and anti-HER3 diabody in nude mice bearing xenografts that express EGFR and HER3 , respectively.

Site-specifically IRDye800CW-labeled imaging probes bound to their immobilized targets , cells expressing these targets , and selectively accumulated in xenografts. These results highlight the ease and utility of using the modular SpyTag/SpyCatcher protein ligase system for site-specific fluorescent labeling of protein-based imaging probes. Imaging probes labeled in this manner will be useful for optical imaging applications such as image-guided surgery and have broad application for other imaging modalities.
