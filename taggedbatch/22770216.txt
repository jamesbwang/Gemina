 The nuclear lamina ( NL) is a filamentous protein meshwork , composed essentially of lamins , situated between the inner nuclear membrane and the chromatin. The NL is a component of the nuclear envelope , interacts with a wide range of proteins and is required for normal nuclear structure and physiological development. During spermiogenesis the spermatid nucleus is elongated , and dramatically reduced in size with protamines replacing histones to produce a highly compacted chromatin. There is mounting evidence from studies in human and rodent , that the NL plays an important role in mammalian spermatid differentiation during spermiogenesis. In this review , we summarize and discuss the data available in the literature regarding the involvement of lamins and their direct or indirect partners in normal and abnormal human spermiogenesis.
