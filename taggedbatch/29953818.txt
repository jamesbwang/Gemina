 It is shown that multiple ionization energies of metal-chalcogenide clusters can be substantially reduced by adding ligands that form charge transfer complexes. We demonstrate this intriguing phenomenon by considering metal-chalcogenide clusters including cases where a cluster has a filled electronic shell with a large gap between the occupied and unoccupied states reminiscent of stable species. The studies include a Co
