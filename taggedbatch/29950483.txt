 Branching morphogenesis is essential for the successful development of a functional lung to accomplish its gas exchange function. Although many studies have highlighted requirements for the bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP) signaling pathway during branching morphogenesis , little is known about how BMP signaling is regulated. Here , we report that the protein arginine methyltransferase 5 ( Prmt5) and symmetric dimethylation at histone H4 arginine 3 ( H4R3sme2) directly associate with chromatin of
