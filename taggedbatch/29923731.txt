 Bis-resorcin ( 4) arene 2 connected by its lower rims was synthesized via click chemistry and found , by diffusion NMR , to self-assemble quantitatively , despite the different alternatives , into hexameric capsules reminiscent of the well-characterized hexameric capsule of resorcin ( 4) arene 1. The hexameric capsules of the flexible bis-resorcin ( 4) arene 2 prevail in apolar organic solvents and can , as expected , encapsulate quite well ammonium salts , demonstrating that spontaneous self-assembly into hexameric capsules is a general characteristic of such systems.
