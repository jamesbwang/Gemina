 Exercise prehabilitation may improve outcomes after surgery. Frailty is a key predictor of adverse postoperative outcomes in older people; the multidimensional nature of frailty makes this a population who may derive substantial benefit from exercise prehabilitation. The objective of this trial is to test the efficacy of exercise prehabilitation to improve postoperative functional outcomes for people living with frailty having cancer surgery with curative intent. We will conduct a single-centre , parallel-arm randomised controlled trial of home-based exercise prehabilitation versus standard care among consenting patients > 60 years having elective cancer surgery ( intra-abdominal and intrathoracic) and who are frail ( Clinical Frailty Scale > 4 Ethical approval has been granted by our ethics review board ( Protocol Approval # 2016009-01H). Results will be disseminated through presentation at scientific conferences , through peer-reviewed publication , stakeholder organisations and engagement of social and traditional media.
