 Oral diseases affect a large number of people in the world and have a great influence on their quality of life. Nevertheless , oral health promotion and prevention initiatives are lacking. The aim of this study was to identify characteristics of individuals in Italy who renounce dental care in order to better support institutional prevention campaigns. Using data from the Italian National Institute of Statistic ( ISTAT) survey `` Health condition and use of health services '' , we divided the sample into two groups: individuals who renounced dental care even when needed and those who accessed dental healthcare. We then compared information about socio-economic and oral health profile of the two groups. People who renounced dental treatments are mostly young adults , smokers , belonging to the middle-low socioeconomic level , not married and unemployed. Economic resources are often the main reason behind renouncing dental treatments. Our study underlines that economic conditions play a leading role in renouncing dental care. In order to avoid additional costs to the Italian healthcare system , our proposal is to implement a specific prevention campaign for oral diseases , targeting young adults living in Italy.
