 Innovative measures have recently been proposed to prevent periprosthetic joint infection following total hip and knee arthroplasty. We sought to review these recent innovations to determine the reported reduction in periprosthetic joint infection. The most recent literature demonstrates promising results in regard to hydrofiber dressings as an independent risk factor for primary prosthetic joint infection reduction , which in turn is also linked with cost savings. As our understanding of safe yet effective concentrations of antiseptic solutions develops , dilute betadine in particular has demonstrated encouraging efficacy which warrants continued investigation through controlled trials. In summary , we found that the application of a hydrofiber dressing may prove beneficial in decreasing the risk of prosthetic joint infection following primary total hip and knee arthroplasty. The gold standard for an infection prevention protocol continues to be explored and optimized.
