 Kinesins are widely expressed , microtubule-dependent motors<symptom> that play vital roles in microtubule-associated cellular activities , such as cell division and intracellular transport. Eg5 , also known as kinesin-5 or kinesin spindle protein , is a member of the kinesin family that contributes to the formation and maintenance of the bipolar mitotic spindle during cell division. Small-molecule compounds that inhibit Eg5 activity have been shown to impair spindle assembly , block mitotic progression , and possess anti-cancer activity. Recent studies focusing on the localization and functions of Eg5 in plants have demonstrated that in addition to spindle organization , this motor protein has non-canonical functions , such as chromosome segregation and cytokinesis , that have not been observed in animals. In this review , we discuss the structure , function , and localization of Eg5 in various organisms , highlighting the specific role of this protein in plants. We also propose directions for the future studies of novel Eg5 functions based on the lessons learned from plants.
