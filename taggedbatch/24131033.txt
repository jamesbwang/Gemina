 The Proviral Integration site of Moloney murine leukemia<disease> virus ( PIM) serine/threonine protein kinases are overexpressed in many hematologic and solid tumor malignancies and play central roles in intracellular signaling networks important in tumorigenesis , including the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription ( JAK/STAT) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K)/ AKT pathways. The three PIM kinase isozymes ( PIM1 , PIM2 , and PIM3) share similar downstream substrates with other key oncogenic kinases and have differing but mutually compensatory functions across tumors. This supports the therapeutic potential of pan-PIM kinase inhibitors , especially in combination with other anticancer agents chosen based on their role in overlapping signaling networks. Reported here is a preclinical characterization of INCB053914 , a novel , potent , and selective adenosine triphosphate-competitive pan-PIM kinase inhibitor. In vitro , INCB053914 inhibited proliferation and the phosphorylation of downstream substrates in cell lines from multiple hematologic malignancies. Effects were confirmed in primary bone<disease> marrow blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia<disease> treated ex vivo and in blood samples from patients receiving INCB053914 in an ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation study. In vivo , single-agent INCB053914 inhibited Bcl-2-associated death promoter protein phosphorylation and dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth in acute myeloid leukemia<disease> and multiple myeloma xenografts. Additive or synergistic inhibition of tumor growth was observed when INCB053914 was combined with selective PI3KÎ´ inhibition , selective JAK1 or JAK1/2 inhibition , or cytarabine. Based on these data , pan-PIM kinase inhibitors , including INCB053914 , may have therapeutic utility in hematologic malignancies when combined with other inhibitors of oncogenic kinases or standard chemotherapeutics.
