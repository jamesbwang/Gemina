 Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries ( MINOCA) is a syndrome<disease><symptom> with different causes , characterised by clinical evidence of myocardial infarction with normal or near-normal coronary arteries on angiography. Its prevalence ranges between 5 % and 25 % of all myocardial infarction. The prognosis is extremely variable , depending on the cause of MINOCA. The key principle in the management of this syndrome<disease><symptom> is to clarify the underlying individual mechanisms to achieve patient-specific treatments. Clinical history , electrocardiogram , cardiac enzymes , echocardiography , coronary angiography and left ventricular angiography represent the first level diagnostic investigations to identify the causes of MINOCA. Regional wall motion abnormalities at left ventricular angiography limited to a single epicardial coronary artery territory identify an ` epicardial pattern ` whereas regional wall motion abnormalities extended beyond a single epicardial coronary artery territory identify a ` microvascular pattern '. The most common causes of MINOCA are represented by coronary plaque disease , coronary dissection , coronary artery spasm , coronary microvascular spasm , Takotsubo cardiomyopathy , myocarditis<disease> , coronary thromboembolism , other forms of type 2 myocardial infarction and MINOCA of uncertain aetiology. This review aims at summarising the diagnosis and management of MINOCA , according to the underlying physiopathology.
