 Current progress in the prediction of mechanical behavior of solids requires understanding of spatiotemporal complexity of plastic flow caused by self-organization of crystal defects. It may be particularly important in hexagonal materials because of their strong anisotropy and combination of different mechanisms of plasticity , such as dislocation glide and twinning. These materials often display complex behavior even on the macroscopic scale of deformation curves , e.g. , a peculiar three-stage elastoplastic transition , the origin of which is a matter of debates. The present work is devoted to a multiscale study of plastic flow in & alpha;- Ti , based on simultaneous recording of deformation curves , 1D local strain field , and acoustic emission ( AE). It is found that the average AE activity also reveals three-stage behavior , but in a qualitatively different way depending on the crystallographic orientation of the sample axis. On the finer scale , the statistical analysis of AE events and local strain rates testifies to an avalanche-like character of dislocation processes , reflected in power-law probability distribution functions. The results are discussed from the viewpoint of collective dislocation dynamics and are confronted to predictions of a recent micromechanical model of Ti strain hardening.
