 Purposes Intervention mapping ( IM) is a protocol for developing effective behavior change interventions. It has been used for 10 years to develop work disability prevention ( WDP) interventions , but it is not known to what extent and with what success. The main objective of this study was to review the effectiveness of these interventions. Secondary objectives were to review their fidelity to the IM protocol , their theoretical frameworks and their content. Methods A search strategy was conducted in MEDLINE , Web of Science , PsycINFO , Pascal , Francis , and BDSP. All titles and abstracts were reviewed. A standardized extraction form was developed. All included studies were reviewed by two reviewers blinded to each other. Results Eight WDP interventions were identified aimed at return to work ( RTW; n = 6) and self-management at work ( n = 2). RTW interventions targeted workers with stress-related mental disorders ( n = 1) , low<symptom> back pain ( n = 1) , musculoskeletal disorders ( n = 1) , cancer ( n = 2) and gynecological surgery ( n = 1). The fidelity to the IM protocol was weaker for the participatory planning group. Matrices of change , change methods , and applications were systematically reported. The main theoretical frameworks used were the attitude-social influence-self efficacy model ( n = 4) and the theory of planned behavior ( n = 2). Half of the interventions included a workplace component ( n = 4). Two interventions were reported as effective , and one partially effective. Conclusion The IM protocol is used in WDP since 2007. The participative dimension appears underused. Few theoretical frameworks were used. Implications are to better consider the stakeholders involvement , and mobilize theoretical frameworks with greater attempts to intervene on the work environment.
