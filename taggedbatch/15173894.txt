 Human and animal studies suggest an intriguing link between mitochondrial diseases and depression<symptom>. Although depression<symptom> has historically been linked to alterations in monoaminergic pharmacology and adult hippocampal neurogenesis , new data increasingly implicate broader forms of dampened plasticity , including plasticity within the cell. Mitochondria are the cellular powerhouse of eukaryotic cells , and they also regulate brain function through oxidative stress and apoptosis. In this paper , we make the case that mitochondrial dysfunction could play an important role in the pathophysiology of depression<symptom>. Alterations in mitochondrial functions such as oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS) and membrane polarity , which increase oxidative stress and apoptosis , may precede the development of depressive symptoms. However , the data in relation to antidepressant drug effects are contradictory: some studies reveal they have no effect on mitochondrial function or even potentiate dysfunction , whereas other studies show more beneficial effects. Overall , the data suggest an intriguing link between mitochondrial function and depression<symptom> that warrants further investigation. Mitochondria could be targeted in the development of novel antidepressant drugs , and specific forms of mitochondrial dysfunction could be identified as biomarkers to personalize treatment and aid in early diagnosis by differentiating between disorders with overlapping symptoms.
