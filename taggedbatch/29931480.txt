 There is a lack of population studies evaluating the impact of bariatric surgery ( BRS) on all-cause inpatient mortality. We sought to determine the impact of prior BRS on all-cause mortality and healthcare utilization in hospitalized patients. We analyzed the National Inpatient Sample database from 2007 to 2013. Participants were adult ( â‰¥ 18 years) inpatients admitted with a diagnosis of morbid obesity or a history of BRS. Propensity score-matched analyses were performed to compare mortality and healthcare resource utilization ( hospital length of stay and cost). There were 9,044,103 patient admissions with morbid obesity and 1,066,779 with prior BRS. A propensity score-matched cohort analysis demonstrated that prior BRS was associated with decreased mortality ( OR = 0.58; 95 % CI ( 0.54 , 0.63)) , shorter length of stay ( 0.59 days; P < 0.001) , and lower hospital costs ( $ 2152; P < 0.001) compared to morbid obesity. A subgroup of propensity score-matched analysis among patients with high-risk of mortality ( leading ten causes of mortality in morbid obesity) revealed a consistently significant reduction in odds of mortality for patients with prior BRS ( OR = 0.82; 95 % CI ( 0.72 , 0.92)). Hospitalized patients with a history of BRS have lower all-cause mortality and healthcare resource utilization compared to those who are morbidly obese. These observations support the continued application of BRS as an effective and resource-conscious treatment for morbid obesity.
