 Hand eczema<disease><symptom> ( HE) is common and may follow a chronic<disease> disease<disease> course. So far , prospective studies investigating the risk factors for disease progression as a prerequisite for targeted prevention are scarce. To evaluate the overall association of HE-associated factors with clinical and quality of life ( QoL) improvement during a follow-up of 2 years. Data of the prospective patient cohort ( N = 199) followed by the Swiss chronic HE ( CHE) registry on long-term patient management ( CARPE-CH) were analysed by means of both classic regression and semantic map analyses. Both severity of HE and QoL significantly improved over the period of 2 years ( P < .001). However , 20 % of patients had moderate<symptom> to severe HE after 2 years of follow-up. As factors associated with an unfavourable CHE clinical course and QoL , environmental exposures , male sex , occupational skin disease , job loss or change at baseline , allergic contact dermatitis<disease> , a chronic<disease> disease<disease> course , palmar localization and widespread eczema<disease><symptom> were identified. Analysis of prospective data from CARPE-CH shows a complex pattern of associations among variables as shown by semantic map and classic statistical analyses. Factors related to occupational exposure had the highest impact on CHE.
