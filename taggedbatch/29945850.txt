 Catheter ablation ( CA) is an established therapy for selected patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) , but predictors of CA ablation outcome are still not fully elucidated. The aim of the study was to identify structural and morphological parameters from computed tomography ( CT) as predictors of successful CA of AF in a single center prospective cohort. An analysis of CT scans dedicated to LA evaluation was performed in 99 patients ( 63 ± 8 years old , 70 % males , 59 % paroxysmal AF) scheduled for CA of AF. Survival free of atrial fibrillation/flutter/tachycardia at 1- and 3-years was assessed. In overall study population , both 1- and 3-year responders had smaller distance to the first division in left superior pulmonary vein ( 16.3 ± 5.42 mm vs. 19.1 ± 7.0 mm and 14.9 ± 3.6 mm vs. 18.7 ± 7.0 mm; p < 0.05). One-year responders had larger ostium area of left inferior pulmonary vein ( median 236 mm The anatomy of LA , especially morphology of pulmonary veins , seems to be one of the predictors of clinical outcome after CA for paroxysmal AF. In non-paroxysmal AF LA anatomy is less relevant in prediction of clinical outcome.
