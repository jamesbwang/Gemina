 Immunotherapy with PD-1 antibodies has greatly increased prognosis of patients with advanced melanoma. Identifying biomarkers that predict overall survival ( OS) and response to immunotherapy is important. OS and best overall response according to RECIST version 1.1 were analysed , and S100B and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) serum levels were assessed retrospectively in 152 patients treated with anti-PD-1 , and in 86 patients treated with anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 antibodies at University Hospital Tuebingen , Germany. In the pembrolizumab group , patients with elevated baseline S100B or LDH exhibited significantly impaired OS compared with patients with normal S100B ( 1-year OS: 51.1 % vs 83.1 % , log-rank P < .0001) and normal LDH ( 1-year OS: 44.4 % vs 80.8 % , P = .00022) , respectively. LDH increases of > 25 % and S100B increases of > 145 % compared to baseline were significantly associated with impaired OS ( both P < .0001). In patients treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab , baseline S100B and increasing S100B levels of > 145 % as well as baseline LDH were associated with impaired OS ( P < .0001 , P = .00060 , and P = .0050 , respectively) , whereas increasing LDH of > 25 % was not ( P = .64). S100B could serve as a strong baseline marker for OS in melanoma patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. Rising S100B levels during the first weeks of therapy could help guide treatment decisions.
