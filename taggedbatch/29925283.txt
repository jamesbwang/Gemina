 Testosterone is the predominant gonadal androgen in men. Low testosterone levels are found to be associated with an increased in metabolic risk and systematic inflammation<symptom>. Since adipose tissue is a source of inflammatory cytokines , testosterone may regulate inflammation<symptom> by acting on adipose tissue. This review aimed to explore the role of testosterone in inflammation<symptom> and its mechanism of action. Both animal studies and human studies showed that ( 1) testosterone deficiency was associated with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines; ( 2) testosterone substitution reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines. The suppression of inflammation<symptom> by testosterone were observed in patients with coronary artery disease , prostate cancer and diabetes mellitus through the increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-10) and the decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1β , IL-6 , and TNF-α). Despite these , some studies also reported a non-significant relationship. In conclusion , testosterone may possess anti-inflammatory properties but its magnitude is debatable. More evidence is needed to validate the use of testosterone as a marker and in the management of chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>.
