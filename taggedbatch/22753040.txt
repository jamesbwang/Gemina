 High-throughput sequencing tools promise to revolutionize many aspects of genetic research , e.g. by allowing the identification of functional adaptive genetic variation. However , the expense and expertise required to apply these tools to basic conservation questions is a challenge for applications outside academia , resulting in a so-called ` conservation genomics gap ' ( Shafer
