 Graphene oxide ( GO)- based resistive-switching ( RS) memories offer the promise of low-temperature solution-processability and high mechanical flexibility , making them ideally suited for future flexible electronic devices. The RS of GO can be recognized as electric-field-induced connection/disconnection of nanoscale reduced graphene oxide ( RGO) conducting filaments ( CFs). Instead of operating an electrical FORMING process , which generally results in high randomness of RGO CFs due to current overshoot , a TiO
