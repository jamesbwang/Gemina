 Epiphytic lichens are sensitive bioindicators responding to climate change and atmospheric pollutants. Climate warming changes in lichen biota have been reported from Western and Central Europe; therefore , similar trends in the biota of the close-to-natural forests of Eastern Europe were expected. In both examinations ( 1987-1989 and 2015-2016) of 144 permanent plots the same field method was used. The following functional epiphyte groups were distinguished: climate warming indicators ( VDI species and species containing Trentepohlia algae<pathogen>) and Wirth 's ecological indicators ( T- temperature , N- eutrophication , R- reaction , M- moisture). PCA ordination for exploring species composition changes , species richness and diversity ( Shannon-Wiener index) in different forest<disease> types was used. When compared with the earlier survey , a higher plot species richness , Shannon-Wiener diversity index , and proportion of more nitrogen-demanding lichens , and lower proportions of warm-demanding and high-acidity tolerant lichens were found. No change in the epiphyte biota composition influenced by the decreasing atmospheric precipitation was detected. The species richness and Shannon-Wiener index of climate warming indicators did not show a significant change. Although the share and frequency of epiphytic lichen species and their functional groups changed over a 25-year period , no relationship was found to be related to climate warming: indicators of global warming showed no significant change in frequency , while those with higher value of T even decreased frequency. The changes suggest a connection with eutrophication ( increase in frequency of species with higher value of N) and a decrease in sulphur deposition ( increase in frequency of species with higher value of R).
