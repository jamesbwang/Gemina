 Chickpea is a highly nutritious grain legume crop , widely appreciated as a health food , especially in the Indian subcontinent. The major constraints on chickpea production are biotic ( Helicoverpa , bruchid , aphid , ascochyta) and abiotic ( drought , heat , salt , cold) stresses , which reduce the yield by up to 90 %. Various strategies like conventional breeding , molecular breeding , and modern plant breeding have been used to overcome these problems. Conventionally , breeding programs aim at development of varieties that combine maximum number of traits through inter-specific hybridization , wide hybridization , and hybridization involving more than two parents. Breeding is difficult in this crop because of its self-pollinating nature and limited genetic variation. Recent advances in in vitro culture and gene technologies offer unique opportunities to realize the full potential of chickpea production. However , as of date , no transgenic chickpea variety has been approved for cultivation in the world. In this review , we provide an update on the development of genetically modified chickpea plants , including those resistant to Helicoverpa armigera , Callosobruchus maculatus , Aphis craccivora , as well as to drought and salt stress. The genes utilized for development of resistance against pod borer , bruchid , aphid , drought , and salt tolerance , namely , Bt , alpha amylase inhibitor , ASAL , P5CSF129A , and P5CS , respectively , are discussed.
