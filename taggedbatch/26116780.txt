 Survival with good neurological function post out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA) , defined as cerebral performance category ( CPC) 1-2 , ranges from 1.6 % to 3 % in Asia. We aim to study the influence of comorbidities and peri-OHCA event factors on neurological recovery and develop a model that can help clinicians predict neurological function among patients with post-OHCA admitted to the hospital. This was a retrospective cohort study. All patients admitted post-OHCA from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2015 to a tertiary centre were identified through the hospital OHCA registry. Patients who survived till hospital admission were included. Logistic regression was used to identify patient and peri-arrest factors that were significantly associated with survival with CPC 1-2. The significant factors for survival with CPC 1-2 were then put into a multivariable model and the discriminative ability was tested using the receiver operator characteristic ( ROC) curve. Calibration and internal validation of the model were also performed. External validation in a small prospective cohort was also performed. In our derivation cohort of 129 patients , 30.23 % survived with CPC 1-2. Significant factors associated with survival with good neurological outcomes were age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index ≤ 5 , time to first return of spontaneous circulation ≤ 40 min , the presence of immediate bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and shockable rhythms. We also developed a nomogram which showed good internal ( ROC curve 0.84; 95 % CI 0.77 to 0.91) and external validation ( ROC curve 0.90; 95 % CI 0.81 to 1.00).
