 To evaluate the natural history of diabetic retinopathy ( DR) in diabetic patients and to assess long term risk for other chronic<disease> diseases<disease> associated with DR. Retrospective , community-based study. Diabetics who underwent their first fundoscopic examination during 2000-2002 , and had at least one follow- up examination by the end of 2007 were included. The primary outcome was the development of DR ( proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR) , non PDR ( NPDR) or macular edema<symptom>. Patients were followed for another 9 years for documentation of new diagnosis of related diseases. 516 patients ' ( 1,032 eyes) records were included and were followed first for an average of 4.15 Â± 1.27 years. During follow-up , 28 ( 2.7 %) of the total 1,032 eyes examined were diagnosed with PDR. An additional 194 ( 18.8 %) eyes were diagnosed with new NPDR. The cumulative incidence of NPDR was 310/1 ,032 ( 30.0 %). All the patients who developed PDR had prior NDPR. By the end of the 9 years extended follow up , patients with NPDR had a greater risk for developing chronic renal<symptom> failure<symptom> HR = 1.71 ( 1.14-2.56) , ischemic heart disease HR = 1.57 ( 1.17-2.09) , and had an increased mortality rate HR = 1.26 ( 1.02-1.57) Conclusion: DR is associated with a higher rate of diabetes complications. Patients with DR should be followed more closely. Key points During a mean follow-up of 4.5 years , the cumulative incidence of diabetic retinopathy in a community cohort was 18.8 %. NDPR ( non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy) is a predictor of PDR ( proliferative diabetic retinopathy). In a real life setting NPDR is a marker of a poorer prognosis. Patients with NDPR should be monitored more closely.
