 The diagnosis of human brucellosis<disease> requires culture or serological tests for the conformation of the clinical findings. Isolation of the bacteria is used as a gold standard , however it is time consuming and processing of positive cultures has a potential risk for laboratory acquired human brucellosis<disease>. Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) based methods have offered new approaches for early diagnosis of brucellosis<disease> and reduce the risk of laboratory acquired human brucellosis<disease>. A major limitation of the PCR method is the difficulty to remove the inhibitors in specimens. The aim of this study was to determine the performance of two DNA extraction kits by using two separate PCR master mixes and to determine appropriate `` extraction kit- PCR master mix '' combination for the diagnosis of Brucella from whole blood samples and blood culture bottles. Two commercial DNA extraction kits , NORGEN Blood DNA isolation kit ( Norgen) and Thermo Scientific GeneJet Whole blood genomic DNA purification kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , USA) and two PCR master mixes , QuantiTect multiplex PCR ( QuentiTect , Qiager , Almanya) and Ampliqon Multiplex TEMPase ( Amliqon , Denmark) were assessed on 30 simulated blood samples with known concentrations ( 102-104 cfu/ml) of Brucella<pathogen> melitensis<pathogen> ATCC 23456 strain and 10 blood culture bottles that gave positive signal. By using different combinations of extraction kits and PCR master mixes , a total of 160 different multiplex real-time PCR ( Rt-PCR) trials were performed with probes and primers specific to Brucella spp. , B.melitensis , and the internal control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH). All the 120 Rt-PCR trials performed on the DNA samples extracted from blood samples gave positive results with GAPDH probe/primers. The rate of positive PCR results for Brucella spp. was 96.7 % for the combination of Norgen-QuantiTect , 93.3 % for Thermo-Ampliqon , 93.3 % for Thermo-QuantiTect , and 86.7 % for Norgen-Ampliqon. The frequency of positive B.melitensis results for these combinations were 96.7 % , 93.3 % , 56.7 % and 90 % , respectively. In the samples with the bacterial density of 102 cfu/ml , Brucella spp. detection rates were 80 % for Thermo-Ampliqon and Norgen-Ampliqon , and 90 % for Thermo-QuantiTect and Norgen-QuantiTect; and for B.melitensis positivite rates were 90 % , 70 % , 20 % , and 90 % , respectively. Rt-PCR assays with the DNA samples extracted from blood culture bottles using Norgen isolation kit yielded 80 % positivite result. However , the frequency of PCR positivite results was only 20 % in the DNA samples extracted by Thermo DNA extraction kit. PCR result for GAPDH gene was also negative in 80 % of the samples extracted by Thermo kit. Our results revealed that for the removal of inhibitors and detection of even low number of Brucella spp./ B.melitensis in blood samples and blood culture bottles , NORGEN Blood DNA isolation kit can be used with a combination of QuantiTect multiplex PCR or Ampliqon Multiplex TEMPase.
