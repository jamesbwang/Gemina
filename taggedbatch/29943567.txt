 This work reported the construction of a chiral sensor based on an organic field-effect transistor to probe the subtle change of weak interactions in the chiral discrimination process , with the ability to achieve fast , sensitive , and quantitative real-time chiral analysis for various racemic pairs , where a β-cyclodextrin ( β-CD) sensitized copper hexadecafluorophthalocyanine ( F
