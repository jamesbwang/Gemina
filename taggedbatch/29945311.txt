 Periostin ( POSTN) plays an important role in numerous cancers , especially in gastrointestinal malignancy. The objective of this study was to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic role of serum POSTN in colorectal cancer ( CRC). Serum periostin , together with CEA , CA19 .9 , CA72 .4 , and CA242 levels were measured in samples from 108 patients with CRC and 56 healthy controls , and their correlation with clinical characteristics was further analyzed. Receiver operating curves ( ROC) , Kaplan-Meier curves , and log-rank analyses were used to evaluate diagnostic and prognostic significance. Serum POSTN levels were significantly higher in patients with CRC compared with healthy controls ( p < 0.0001) and associated with clinical stages ( p < 0.001). ROC analysis revealed that POSTN was a biomarker comparable to CEA , CA19 .9 , and CA72 .4 to distinguish all CRC from healthy controls ( AUC = 0.75). Moreover , POSTN retained its diagnostic ability for CEA-negative ( AUC = 0.69) and CA19.9-negative CRC patients ( AUC = 0.71). Survival analysis revealed that patients with lower serum POSTN had longer overall survival than those with high serum POSTN ( p = 0.0146). Serum POSTN might be a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for patients with CRC.
