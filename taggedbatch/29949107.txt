 Molecules exhibiting antioxidant , neuroprotective , and regulatory properties inherent to natural products consumed by humans are gaining attention in biomedical research. Ferulic acid ( FA) is a phenolic compound possessing antioxidant and cytoprotective properties. It is found in several vegetables , including sugarcane , where it serves as the main antioxidant component. Here , we compared the antioxidant and cytoprotective effects of FA with those of the total sugarcane aqueous extract ( SCAE). Specifically , we assessed biochemical markers of cell dysfunction in rat cortical brain slices and markers of physiological stress in Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> upon exposure to toxins evoking different mechanisms of neurotoxicity , including direct oxidative stress and/or excitotoxicity. In rat cortical slices , FA ( 250 and 500 μM) , but not SCAE ( ~ 270 μM of total polyphenols) , prevented the loss of reductive capacity induced by the excitotoxin quinolinic acid ( QUIN , 100 μM) , the pro-oxidant agent ferrous sulfate ( FeSO
