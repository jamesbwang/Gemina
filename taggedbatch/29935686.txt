 Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy is a complex procedure with high cost and significant morbidity and mortality. The associated learning curve is steep and could reliably be evaluated using specific statistics. Risk-adjusted sequential probability ratio test is an effective and robust method to monitor surgical performance in the learning and audit phase of a peritoneal surface malignancies center development. The most critical factor associated with surgical performance is mentoring of the trainee by an expert. A well-structured tutor-based training program has been implemented in Europe. This initiative will improve the standardization of the combined procedure and improve quality of services across the continent.
