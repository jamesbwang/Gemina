 In stroke due to large vessel occlusion , thrombotic material can be demonstrated by the susceptibility vessel sign ( SVS) , a hypointense signal on T2 *- weighted gradient echo magnetic resonance ( GRE) images. In the present study , we evaluated the value of GRE for the detection of perforating artery occlusion in hyperacute lacunar infarction ( LI). The presence of SVS on GRE in 58 patients with LI who underwent magnetic resonance imaging within 24 hours after symptom onset was analyzed. On diffusion-weighted images ( DWI) , LI was found in the basal ganglia in 17.2 % , internal capsule in 25.9 % , corona radiata in 19.0 % , thalamus in 32.8 % , and brainstem in 5.2 %. On GRE a subtle circumscribed hypointense signal at the lower edge of the LI consistent with SVS was detected in 11/58 ( 19 %) patients. Patients with SVS had larger ischemic lesions<symptom> on DWI ( p = 0.045). SVS on GRE may be useful for detection of perforating artery occlusion in a subset of patients with hyperacute LI.
