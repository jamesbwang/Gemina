 We proposed a new deep learning model by analyzing electroencephalogram signals to reduce the complexity of feature extraction and improve the accuracy of recognition of fatigue<symptom> status of pilots. For one thing , we applied wavelet packet transform to decompose electroencephalogram signals of pilots to extract the δ wave ( 0.4-3 Hz) , θ wave ( 4-7 Hz) , α wave ( 8-13 Hz) and β wave ( 14-30 Hz) , and the combination of them was used as de-nosing electroencephalogram signals. For another , we proposed a deep contractive auto-encoding network-Softmax model for identifying pilots ' fatigue<symptom> status. Its recognition results were also compared with other models. The experimental results showed that the proposed deep learning model had a nice recognition , and the accuracy of recognition was up to 91.67 %. Therefore , recognition of fatigue<symptom> status of pilots based on deep contractive auto-encoding network is of great significance.
