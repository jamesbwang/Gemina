 Metastasis is the most important feature of gastric cancer ( GC) and the most widely recognized reason for GC-related deaths. Unfortunately , the underlying mechanism behind this metastasis remains unknown. Mounting evidence suggests the dynamic regulatory role of sirtuin2 ( SIRT2) , a histone deacetylase ( HDAC) , in cell migration and invasion. The present study aims to evaluate the biological function of SIRT2 in GC and identify the target of SIRT2 as well as evaluate its therapeutic efficacy. We found that SIRT2 was upregulated in GC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues , and this was correlated with reduced patient survival. Although CCK8 and colony-formation assays showed that SIRT2 overexpression marginally promoted proliferation in GC cell lines , SIRT2 knockdown or treatment with SirReal2 decreased the migration and invasion of GC cells. We demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo that SirReal2 could inhibit the deacetylation activity of SIRT2 and its downstream target PEPCK1 , which is related to mitochondrial metabolism and RAS/ERK/JNK/ MMP-9 pathway. Taken together , these results demonstrate for the first time that SirReal2 selectively targets SIRT2 and decreases migration as well as invasion in human GC cells. SirReal2 therefore shows promise as a new drug candidate for GC therapy.
