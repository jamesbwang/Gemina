 To determine whether a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation ( SpO2) of 95 % to 96 % should be considered `` nonurgent '' in school-aged children , as suggested by the Canadian Emergency Department Triage and Acuity Scale.School-aged children ( 6-12 years old) with a normal body temperature ( 36.5-37.4 °C) who visited our department between September , 2014 and August , 2015 ( n = 4556) were divided into 4 groups based on SpO2: group A: 99 % to 100 %; group B: 97 % to 98 %; group C: 95 % to 96 %; and group D: ≤ 94 %. The heart rate ( HR) , respiratory rate ( RR) , and hospitalization rate were compared among the groups , and also between children with SpO2 95 % to 96 % and matched controls with SpO2 ≥ 97 % ( n = 280 each). Among 4556 eligible patients , groups A , B , C , and D comprised 2700 patients ( 59.3 %) , 1534 patients ( 33.6 %) , 280 patients ( 6.2 %) , and 42 patients ( 0.9 %) , respectively. The median ( interquartile range ( IQR)) RR significantly increased with decreasing SpO2 ( 23 ( 20-25) , 24 ( 20-26) , 24 ( 23-30) , and 30 ( 24-40) breaths/min in groups A-D , respectively; P < .001). Similarly , the median ( IQR) HR significantly increased with decreasing SpO2 ( 93 ( 83-104) , 98 ( 87-110) , 107 ( 93-119) , and 121 ( 109-137) bpm , groups A-D , respectively; P < .001). Group D had the highest annual hospital admission rate ( 18 cases/42 patients , 42.9 %). Further , the HR and RR differed significantly between the cases ( 107 ( 93-119) bpm; 24 ( 23-30) breaths/min) and controls ( 96 ( 86-106) bpm; 24 ( 20-28) breaths/min , respectively) ( P < .001 and P = .02 , respectively). An SpO2 of 95 % to 96 % among school-aged children should not be considered `` nonurgent , '' but rather a significant clinical situation that requires early review of HR and RR. Prompt interventions among this group of children will help prevent further destabilization of vital signs , which will , in turn , contribute to decreased healthcare costs.
