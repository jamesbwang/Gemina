 Indoor air problems in schools appear to influence learning outcomes and absence rates. However , previous research has not investigated whether indoor air problems influence the social climate of schools. Therefore , we studied whether indoor air problems observed in schools associate with students ' perceptions of the teacher-student relationship and class spirit. The nationwide sample of Finnish schools ( N = 194 schools/27153 students) was analyzed using multilevel structural equation modeling. Data on the schools ' social climate collected from students were merged with independently collected data on observed indoor air problems from school principals. We found that the teacher-student relationship was reported to be worse in schools with observed indoor air problems compared to those without observed indoor air problems. Furthermore , the reported class spirit was worse in schools with observed indoor air problems , but only among students with a high grade point average. Our findings indicate that indoor air problems may affect the student-perceived social climate.
