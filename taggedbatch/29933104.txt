 Graphene and related materials ( GRMs) have unique optical and thermal characteristics and are expected to be adopted for industrial applications. However , there are concerns with respect to their safety to human health. To conduct cytotoxicity and mutagenicity assessments , exfoliated graphene ( EGr) dispersed in Tween-20 ® was diluted in cell culture medium. Rat alveolar macrophage viability significantly decreased after 24 h exposure to 1 and 10 μg/mL EGr. No significant levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species were detected in the 2 ' ,7 '- dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate assay after 24 h of exposure to EGr. The levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines macrophage inflammatory protein-1α , interleukin ( IL) -1 β , IL-18 , macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 , and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α were significantly higher in cells treated with 10 μg/mL EGr for 24 h than in untreated controls. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that EGr was present in the cytoplasm of the cells. Many genes were upregulated by EGr treatment , and significantly overrepresented gene ontology categories included the biological processes `` response to external stimulus '' , `` response to stress '' , `` cell-cell signaling '' , `` biological adhesion '' , and `` cell proliferation ''. EGr did not induce genetic mutations in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> or cause micronucleus induction in mouse bone<disease> marrow cells. The results suggest that EGr cytotoxicity should be carefully considered.
