 In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) , immune tolerance breakdown leads to autoantibody production and immune-complex glomerulonephritis<disease>. This study aimed to identify pathogenic plasma cells ( PC) in the development of lupus nephritis. PC subsets in peripheral blood and renal tissue of patients with SLE and lupus mice were examined by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy , respectively. Sorting-purified PCs from lupus mice were adoptively transferred into The frequencies of TLR4 These findings demonstrate a pathogenic role of TLR4
