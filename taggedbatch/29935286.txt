 Antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs) are produced by the stimulated humoral immune system. Most mature AMPs contain less than 50 amino acid residues. Some of them are generated from proproteins upon microbial challenges. Here , we report the antimicrobial activities of a proline-rich proprotein , named SlLebocin1 ( SlLeb1) , from the tobacco cutworm Spodoptera litura. SlLebocin1 cDNA contains a 477-bp open reading frame ( ORF<pathogen>). It is mainly expressed in hemocytes and the midgut in na√Øve larvae. The transcript level was significantly induced in hemocytes but repressed in the midgut and fat body by bacterial challenges. The proprotein contains 158 amino acids with 3 RXXR motifs that are characteristic of some Lepidopteral lebocin proproteins. Four peptides corresponding to the predicted processed fragments were synthesized chemically , and their antimicrobial activities against two Gram-negative and two Gram-positive bacterial strains were analyzed. The peptides showed differential antimicrobial activities. For Escherichia<pathogen> coli and Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> , only the C-terminal fragment ( 124-158) showed strong inhibitory effects. For Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , all peptides showed partial inhibitions. None of them inhibited Serratia<pathogen> marcescens<pathogen>. Bacterial morphologies were examined by the scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The antimicrobial peptides either disrupted cellular membrane or inhibited cell division and caused elongated/enlarged morphologies. The results may provide ideas for designing novel antibiotics.
