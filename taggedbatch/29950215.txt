 To investigate the inducing effect of down-regulation of MCL-1 by diallyl disulfide ( DADS) on the G CCK-8 was used to detect the effect of DADS on proliferation of K562 cells , flow cytometry was employed to observe the effect of cycle arrest by DADS and RNAi silencing MCL-1 gene in K562 cells. The expressions of MCL-1 , PCNA and CDK1 in K562 cells treated with DADS were detected by Western blot. The amphigamy of MCL-1 with PCNA and CDK1 was detected by Coimmunoprecipitation. CCK-8 detection showed that the inhibition rates of K562 cells treated with 15 , 30 , 60 , 120 , 240 Âµmol/L DADS were 32.48 % , 59.34 % , 66.42 % , 77.06 % , 81.05 % respectively ( P < 0.05). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the perecentages of G DADS can inhibit the K562 cell proliferation and induce them arrest G
