 One element of the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities ' recently-piloted quality attestation portfolio for clinical ethics consultants is a `` philosophy of clinical ethics consultation statement '' describing the candidate 's approach to clinical ethics consultation. To date , these statements have been under-explored in the literature , in contrast to philosophy statements in other fields such as academic teaching. In this article , I argue there is merit in expanding the content of these statements beyond clinical ethics consultation alone to describe the author 's approach to other important `` domains '' of healthcare ethics practice ( e.g. , organizational policy development/review and ethics teaching). I also claim such statements have at least three additional uses outside quality attestation: ( 1) as a reflective practice learning tool to increase role clarity among practicing healthcare ethicists and bioethics fellows; ( 2) assisting practicing healthcare ethicists in clarifying role expectations with those they work with; and ( 3) helping inform developing professional practice standards.
