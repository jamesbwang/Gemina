 The aim of this study was to compare the reliability and magnitude of the force-velocity ( F-V) relationship parameters ( maximum force ( F0) , maximum velocity ( V0) , F-V slope , and maximum power ( P0)) obtained through the application of only two loads ( i.e. , two-point method) vs. six loads ( i.e. , multiple-point method). Ten physically active men ( age 19.5 ± 0.9 years , body mass 79.0 ± 9.0 kg , height 183.9 ± 8.4 cm) conducted four testing sessions after a preliminary familiarization session with the leg cycle ergometer exercise. In a counterbalanced order , subjects performed two sessions of the multiple-point method ( six loads applied for the F-V modeling) over 1 week and two sessions of the two-point method ( only the lightest and heaviest loads were applied) over another week. The main findings revealed that ( I) the reliability of the F-V relationship parameters was very high and generally of comparable magnitude for both the multiple- ( coefficient of variation ( CV) range 1.91-3.94 %; intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC) range 0.72-0.99) and two-point methods ( CV range 1.41-4.62 %; ICC range 0.76-0.95) , ( II) the magnitude of the same parameters obtained from both methods was highly correlated ( r > 0.80) , and ( III) the P0 assessed from the multiple-point method was significantly lower than the obtained from the two-point method ( P = 0.041; effect size ( ES) 0.36) due to a significant decrease in F0 ( P = 0.039; ES 0.41) with no significant differences observed for V0 ( P = 0.570; ES- 0.15). These results support the two-point method as a reliable , valid , and fatigue-free procedure of assessing the muscle mechanical capacities through the F-V relationship.
