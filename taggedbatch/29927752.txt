 We report a juvenile case of mycosis<disease> fungoides with prominent follicular mucinosis ( FM). The patient was a 9-year old boy who presented with a 2-month history of enlarging alopecic patch with fine scales on the scalp. Dermatologic examination revealed orange-tan slightly palpable plaques with follicular prominence on his trunk. The patient and his family were not aware of these asymptomatic truncal plaques. Histopathologic examination of both-scalp and trunk-lesions revealed folliculotropic lymphocytic infiltration with mucin. Immunohistochemical study showed that lymphocytic infiltration was CD4 dominant. Flow cytometry analyses of peripheral blood were normal. Any abnormal populations and SÃ©zary cells were not observed on blood smear. Polymerase chain reaction testing showed monoclonality for the T-cell receptor4- ( Latin Small Letter Rams Horn) gene. Our patient had the clinical and histopathological diagnosis of follicular mycosis<disease> fungoides-associated follicular mucinosis.
