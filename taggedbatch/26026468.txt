 Osteoarthritis ( OA) , characterized by degradation of articular cartilage , is a leading cause of disability. As the only cell type present in cartilage , chondrocytes play curial roles in the progression of OA. In our study , we aimed to explore the roles of miR-23b in the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced inflammatory injury. LPS-induced cell injury of ATDC5 cells was evaluated by the loss of cell viability , enhancement of cell apoptosis , alteration of apoptosis-associated proteins , and release of inflammatory cytokines. Then , miR-23b level after LPS treatment was assessed by qRT-PCR. Next , the effects of aberrantly expressed miR-23b on the LPS-induced inflammatory injury were explored. The possible target genes of miR-23b were virtually screened by informatics and verified by luciferase assay. Subsequently , whether miR-23b functioned through regulating the target gene was validated. The involved signaling pathways were investigated finally. Cell viability was decreased but cell apoptosis , as well as release of inflammatory cytokines , was enhanced by LPS treatment. MiR-23b was down-regulated by LPS and its overexpression alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory injury. PDCD4 , negatively regulated by miR-23b expression , was verified as a target gene of miR-23b. Following experiments showed miR-23b alleviated LPS-induced cell injury through down-regulating PDCD4 expression. Phosphorylated levels of key kinases in the NF-κB pathway , as well as expressions of key kinases in the Notch pathways , were increased by PDCD4 overexpression. MiR-23b was down-regulated after LPS treatment , and its overexpression ameliorated LPS-induced inflammatory injury in ATDC5 cells by targeting PDCD4 , which could activate the NF-κB/Notch pathways.
