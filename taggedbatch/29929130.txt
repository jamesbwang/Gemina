 The adsorption of sulfamethoxazole ( SMZ) and ketoprofen ( KET) using carbon nanotubes ( CNTs) and CNTs modified with ionic liquids ( ILs) was investigated. Two ionic liquids ( 1-benzyl , 3-hexyl imidazolium , IL1 and 1-benzyl , 3-decahexyl imidazolium , IL2) were synthesized , and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (
