 Risk-adjusted outcomes of elective major vascular surgery that is inclusive of inpatient and 90-day post-discharge adverse outcomes together have not been well studied. We studied 2012-2014 Medicare inpatients who received open aortic procedures , open peripheral vascular procedures , endovascular aortic procedures , and percutaneous angioplasty procedures of the lower extremity for risk-adjusted adverse outcomes of inpatient deaths , 3-sigma prolonged length-of-stay outliers , 90-day post-discharge deaths without readmission , and 90-day post-discharge associated readmissions after excluding unrelated events. Observed and predicted total adverse outcomes for hospitals meeting minimum risk-volume criteria were assessed and hospital-specific z-scores and risk-adjusted adverse outcomes were calculated to compare performance. The total adverse-outcome rate was 27.8 % for open aortic procedures , 31.5 % for open peripheral vascular procedures , 19.6 % for endovascular aortic procedures , and 36.4 % for percutaneous angioplasty procedures. The difference in risk-adjusted adverse-outcome rates between the best- and the poorest-performing deciles were 32.2 % for open aortic procedures , 29.5 % for open peripheral vascular procedures , 21.5 % for endovascular aortic procedures , and 37.1 % for percutaneous angioplasty procedures. The 90-day post-discharge deaths and readmissions were the major driver of overall adverse-outcome rates. The variability in risk-adjusted outcomes among best- and poorest-performing hospitals is over 20 % in all major vascular procedures and indicates that a large opportunity exists for improvement in results.
