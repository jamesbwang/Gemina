 In this study , we analyzed the transcriptome and metabolite profile of the style to explore the essential metabolites and specific genes for pollen tube growth of B. napus in vivo. For sexual reproduction of flowering plants , pollen must germinate on the stigma and the pollen tube must grow through the style to deliver the sperm nuclei to the female gametophyte cells. During this process , the rapidly growing pollen tube can cover substantial distances. Despite the clear requirements for energy and cellular building blocks in this process , few studies have examined the role of metabolism in the style for pollen tube elongation. In this study , we comprehensively analyzed the transcriptome and metabolite profiles during pollen germination and pollen tube growth in the style in Brassica napus. We profiled the transcripts and metabolites stored in pollen and identified many transcripts related to metabolic pathways. Mature pollen contained low levels of nutrients , whereas the styles contained high levels of diverse nutrients. The levels of most nutrients in the style , especially metabolites for cell wall synthesis and energy metabolism , rapidly decreased at 2 h after pollination , along with pollen germination and pollen tube elongation through the style. A subset of genes involved in cell wall synthesis and nutrient transport were expressed specifically in styles at 1 h after pollination. These results demonstrated that successful fertilization involves the transcripts and nutrients stored in mature pollen , and specific gene expression and stored nutrients in the style. Therefore , these findings enhance our understanding of fertilization in B. napus.
