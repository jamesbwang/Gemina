 Many of the most complicated and pressing problems in hazards research require the integration of numerous disciplines. The lack of a common knowledge base , however , often prohibits clear communication and interaction among interdisciplinary researchers , sometimes leading to unsuccessful outcomes. Drawing on experience with several projects and collective expertise that spans multiple disciplines , the authors argue that a promising way to enhance participation and enable communication is to have a common model , or boundary object , that can integrate knowledge from different disciplines. The result is that researchers from different disciplines who use different research methods and approaches can work together toward a shared goal. This article offers four requirements for boundary objects that may enhance hazards research. Based on these requirements , agent-based models have the necessary characteristics to be a boundary object. The article concludes by examining both the value of and the challenges from using agent-based models as the boundary object in interdisciplinary projects.
