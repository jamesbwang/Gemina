 We propose a standard time-of-flight experiment as a method for observing the anyonic statistics of quasiholes in a fractional quantum Hall state of ultracold atoms. The quasihole states can be stably prepared by pinning the quasiholes with localized potentials and a measurement of the mean square radius of the freely expanding cloud , which is related to the average total angular momentum of the initial state , offers direct signatures of the statistical phase. Our proposed method is validated by Monte Carlo calculations for Î½ = 1/2 and 1/3 fractional quantum Hall liquids containing a realistic number of particles. Extensions to quantum Hall liquids of light and to non-Abelian anyons are briefly discussed.
