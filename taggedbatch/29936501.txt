 Internal limiting membrane ( ILM) flap transposition in surgical repair of macular holes represents a new technique offering good anatomical success rates with large macular holes. The aim of the study was to examine microperimetric outcomes 1 year after ILM flap transposition for surgical repair of macular holes. Patients with idi-opathic macular holes scheduled for 23-G pars plana vitrectomy with ILM peeling , ILM flap transposition , and SF6 tamponade were examined in a prospective case series. Distance corrected visual acuity ( DCVA) , optical coherence tomography , and microperimetry were measured before and 1 year after surgery. In all eyes , closure of the macular hole could be achieved. While foveal sensitivity improved in 71 % , perifoveal sensitivity improved in 86 % of the cases. DCVA improved in 83 % and was unchanged in 17 % of the cases. Beside visual acuity , foveal and perifoveal macular sensitivity improved , underlining the functional success of surgery after ILM peeling with ILM flap transposition.
