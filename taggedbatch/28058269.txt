 One of the major challenges in visual neuroscience is represented by foreground-background segmentation. Data from nonhuman primates show that segmentation leads to two distinct , but associated processes: the enhancement of neural activity during figure processing ( i.e. , foreground enhancement) and the suppression of background-related activity ( i.e. , background suppression). To study foreground-background segmentation in ecological conditions , we introduce a novel method based on parametric modulation of low-level image properties followed by application of simple computational image-processing models. By correlating the outcome of this procedure with human fMRI activity , measured during passive viewing of 334 natural images , we produced easily interpretable `` correlation images '' from visual populations. Results show evidence of foreground enhancement in all tested regions , from V1 to lateral occipital complex ( LOC) , while background suppression occurs in V4 and LOC only. Correlation images derived from V4 and LOC revealed a preserved spatial resolution of foreground textures , indicating a richer representation of the salient part of natural images , rather than a simplistic model of object shape. Our results indicate that scene segmentation occurs during natural viewing , even when individuals are not required to perform any particular task.
