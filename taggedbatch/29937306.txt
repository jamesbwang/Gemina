 In most cases of hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HSCT) in pediatric recipient , the priority is given to bone<disease> marrow as a hematopoietic cell ( HSC) source. The same expectations should be given to pediatric sibling donor. Bone<disease> marrow ( BM) harvest is a standard method of HSC collection in pediatric siblings , however peripheral blood HSC ( PBSC) collection is safe in healthy pediatric donors , and target hematopoietic cell yields can be achieved. Bone<disease> marrow or peripheral blood cell collection , both hematopoietic cells and lymphocytes , in pediatric sibling donors is safe , however there is a small risk of severe adverse events ( SAE); still the risk of SAE is lower in children than in adults. The early adverse effects ( AE) both after BM and PBSC collection are mild , short-term and easy to prevent or control , however they can occur in a relatively large proportion of donors. The risk of mild AE is lower in children than in adults , except PBSC collection in children < 20 kg , who might be at risk of various complications. Short-term G-CSF administration and PBSC collection in pediatric donors is safe. No data exist on long-term adverse effects of short-term G-CSF course. Pediatric donors and their parents must be informed about the risk of possible complications.
