 A method is described for high-resolution label-free molecular imaging of human bone tissue. To preserve the lipid content and the heterogeneous structure of osseous tissue , 4 μm thick human bone sections were prepared via cryoembedding and tape-assisted cryosectioning , circumventing the application of organic solvents and a decalcification step. A protocol for comparative mass spectrometry imaging ( MSI) on the same section was established for initial analysis with time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry ( TOF-SIMS) at a lateral resolution of 10 μm to < 500 nm , followed by atmospheric pressure scanning microprobe matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization ( AP-SMALDI) Orbitrap MSI at a lateral resolution of 10 μm. This procedure ultimately enabled MSI of lipids , providing the lateral localization of major lipid classes such as glycero- , glycerophospho- , and sphingolipids. Additionally , the applicability of the recently emerged Orbitrap-TOF-SIMS hybrid system was exemplarily examined and compared to the before-mentioned MSI methods.
