 The aim of this work is the evaluation of quality indicators for the estimation of the shelf life of opened cans using the migration of specific metals as variables. For this reason the determination of targeted analytes such as: Cd , Pb , As , Cu , Cr , Ni , Fe , Mn and Sn in different canned samples ( cardoon , tuna , green and red beans , corn , and fungi<pathogen>) by Electrothermal Atomic Absorption Spectrometry ( Perkin Elmer , SIMAA 6000) was developed and validated. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22. Principal component analysis ( PCA) and cluster analysis were performed in order to examine the correlation between the content of metals and metalloids and the storage time of opened cans. The results showed that there is a strong correlation between metal concentration and storage time , especially for Fe and Sn. The storage time ranged from hours to days and the vast number of collected data sets , led to reliable conclusions about the evaluation of a new shelf life indicator. Principal component analysis indicated the appropriate storage time for opened cans , where no significant migration was observed.
