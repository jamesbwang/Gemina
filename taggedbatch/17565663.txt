 The present study proposed a new concept for targeted radionuclide therapy ( TRT) to improve the intratumoral distribution of radioactivity using two different radiopharmaceuticals. We examined the efficacy of a combination of a tetrameric cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp ( cRGD) peptide-based radiopharmaceutical , Mice with subcutaneous Î± The combination of
