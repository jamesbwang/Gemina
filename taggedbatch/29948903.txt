 The relation of white matter hyperintense lesions<symptom> to episodic memory<symptom> impairment<symptom> in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD) is still controversial. We aimed at evaluating the relation between white matter hyperintense lesions<symptom> and episodic memory decline in patients with PD. In this multicentric prospective study , twenty-one normal controls , 15 PD patients without mild cognitive impairment ( MCI) and 13 PD patients with MCI were selected to conduct a clinico-radiological correlation analysis. Performance during episodic memory testing , age-related white matter changes score , total manual and automated white matter hyperintense lesions<symptom> volume and lobar white matter hyperintense lesions<symptom> volumes were compared between groups using the Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests , and correlations were assessed using the Spearman test. MCI PD patients had impaired free recall. They also had higher total , left prefrontal and left temporal white matter hyperintense lesions<symptom> volumes than normal controls. Free recall performance was negatively correlated with the total white matter hyperintense lesions<symptom> volume , either manually or automatically delineated , but not with the age-related white matter changes score. Using automated segmentation , both the left prefrontal and temporal white matter hyperintense lesions<symptom> volumes were negatively correlated with the free recall performance. Early episodic memory<symptom> impairment<symptom> in MCI PD patients may be related to white matter hyperintense lesions<symptom> , mainly in the prefrontal and temporal lobes. This relation is influenced by the method used for white matter hyperintense lesions<symptom> quantification. Automated volumetry allows for detecting those changes.
