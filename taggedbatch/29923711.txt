 Rational design and construction of metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs) with intricate structural complexity are of prime importance in reticular chemistry. We report our latest addition to the design toolbox in reticular chemistry , namely the concept of merged nets based on merging two edge-transitive nets into a minimal edge-transitive net for the rational construction of intricate mixed-linker MOFs. In essence , a valuable net for design enclosing two edges ( not related by symmetry) is rationally generated by merging two edge-transitive nets , namely ( 3,6)- coordinated spn and 6-coordinated hxg. The resultant merged-net , a ( 3,6,12)- coordinated sph net with net transitivity ( 32) enclosing three nodes and two distinct edges , offers potential for deliberate design of intricate mixed-linker MOFs. We report implementation of the merged-net approach for the construction of isoreticular rare-earth mixed-linker MOFs , sph-MOF-1 to -4 , based on the assembly of 12-c hexanuclear carboxylate-based molecular building blocks ( MBBs) , displaying cuboctahedral building units , 3-c tritopic ligands , and 6-c hexatopic ligands. The resultant sph-MOFs represent the first examples of MOFs where the underlying net is merged from two 3-periodic edge-transitive nets , spn and hxg. Distinctively , the sph-MOF-3 represents the first example of a mixed-linker MOF to enclose both trigonal and hexagonal linkers. The merged-nets approach allows the logical practice of isoreticular chemistry by taking into account the mathematically correlated dimensions of the two ligands to afford the deliberate construction of a mixed-linker mesoporous MOF , sph-MOF-4. The merged-net equation and two key parameters , ratio constant and MBB constant , are disclosed. A merged-net strategy for the design of mixed-linker MOFs by strictly controlling the size ratio between edges is introduced.
