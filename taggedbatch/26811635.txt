 Accumulating evidence demonstrates that dietary supplementation with functional food ingredients play a role in systemic and brain health as well as in healthy ageing. Conversely , deficiencies in calcium and magnesium as a result of the increasing prevalence of a high fat/high sugar `` Western diet '' have been associated with health problems such as obesity , inflammatory bowel diseases , and cardiovascular diseases , as well as metabolic , immune , and psychiatric disorders. It is now recognized that modulating the diversity of gut microbiota , the population of intestinal bacteria , through dietary intervention can significantly impact upon gut health as well as systemic and brain health. In the current study , we show that supplementation with a seaweed and seawater-derived functional food ingredient rich in bioactive calcium and magnesium ( 0.1 % supplementation) as well as 70 other trace elements , significantly enhanced the gut microbial diversity in adult male rats. Given the significant impact of gut microbiota on health , these results position this marine multi-mineral blend ( MMB) as a promising digestive-health promoting functional food ingredient.
