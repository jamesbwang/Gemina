 The term modality compatibility refers to the similarity between stimulus modality and the modality of response-related sensory consequences ( e.g. , vocal responses produce auditory effects). The previous results showed smaller task-switching costs when participants switched between modality compatible tasks ( auditory-vocal and visual-manual) compared to switching between modality incompatible tasks ( auditory-manual and visual-vocal). In the present study using a voluntary task-switching paradigm ( VTS) , participants chose the response modality ( vocal or manual) to indicate the location of either a visual or an auditory stimulus. We examined whether free task choices were biased by modality compatibility , so that modality compatible tasks are preferred in VTS. The choice probability analysis indicated that participants tended to choose the response modality that is compatible to the stimulus modality. However , participants did not show a preference to repeat a stimulus-response ( S-R) modality mapping , but to switch between modality compatibility ( i.e. , from S-R modality compatible mapping to S-R modality incompatible mapping and vice versa). More interestingly , even though participants freely chose the response modality , modality compatibility still influenced task-switching costs , showing larger costs with modality incompatible mappings. The finding that modality compatibility influenced choice behaviour suggests components of both top-down control and bottom-up effects of selecting a response modality for different stimulus modalities.
