 Evaluate the rate of concussions across Big 12 Conference football programs based on ( 1) equipment worn , ( 2) contact level , ( 3) preseason practice versus in-season practice versus games , and ( 4) mechanism of injury for concussion. Descriptive epidemiology study. Big 12 Conference football practices and competitions. Big 12 Conference football teams. All Big 12 Conference institutions collected data on practice types , equipment worn , practice and game participation , and concussions during the fall , preseasons and regular seasons , from 2013 to 2016. Injury rates and injury rate ratios were reported with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). From 2013 to 2016 , there were 375 concussions reported ( 0.98/ 1000 athlete exposures ( AEs) ( 95 % CI , 0.88-1.08)) , an average of approximately 9 concussions per team per year. Concussion rates were highest in games ( 5.73/ 1000 AE) , but among practices , concussion rates were highest in full-pad ( 1.18/ 1000 AEs) and live-contact ( 1.28/ 1000 AEs) practices. Concussion rates increased with increasing contact and equipment worn. Concussion rates were higher in the preseason than in the regular season , even when stratifying by contact level and equipment worn. Practice concussion rates are highest during fully padded and live-contact practices , supporting limitations on practice contact and equipment worn to reduce the risk associated with head-impact exposure. Higher concussion rates in the preseason and during games indicate an effect of play intensity on concussion risk , and further research is needed to evaluate the direct effect of practice contact level and equipment guidelines and restrictions on concussion incidence.
