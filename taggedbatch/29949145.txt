 To explore the effect of microRNA-155 on cervical cancer and its underlying mechanism. Peripheral blood and cervical cancer tissues were collected. We used quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) to detect expressions of microRNA-155 , SOCS1 , Th17-related genes ( RORγt , IL-17A , IL-21 , and IL-22) , and Treg-related genes ( foxp3 , TGF-β , IL-10 , and IL-35) in peripheral blood and cervical cancer tissues. Western blot was used to detect protein expressions of RORγt and foxp3. The proportions of Th17 and Treg cells in CD4 + T cells were measured by flow cytometry. Moreover , IL-17 expression was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). MicroRNA-155 was overexpressed in peripheral blood and cervical cancer tissues of patients with cervical cancer compared with those of normal controls. Th17-related transcription factors and cytokines in cervical cancer tissues were remarkably elevated than those of normal controls , including RORγt , IL-17 , and IL-6. Treg-related transcription factors and cytokines obtained the similar results. Besides , the proportion of Th17 cells in CD4 + T cells was higher in cervical tissues than that of normal controls. In vitro experiments suggested that overexpressed microRNA-155 can inhibit the expression of target gene SOCS1 , promote the differentiation of Th17 and increase levels of IL-17 , RORγt , and STAT3. MicroRNA-155 is involved in the occurrence and progression of cervical cancer via inhibiting SOSC1 expression and inducing Th17/Treg imbalance.
