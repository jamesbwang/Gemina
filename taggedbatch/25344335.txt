 To evaluate the effect of prolonged sandblasting on the bond durability of dual-cure adhesive resin cement to computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing ( CAD/CAM) restoratives. Nano-ceramic LAVA Ultimate and hybrid-ceramic VITA Enamic CAD/CAM blocks were used for this study. Each CAD/CAM block was sectioned into slabs of 4-mm thickness for the microtensile test ( µTBS) test and 2-mm thickness for the surface roughness test. Three groups were created according to the sandblasting protocols; group 1: specimens were sandblasted for 15 seconds , group 2: specimens were sandblasted for 30 seconds , and group 3: specimens were sandblasted for 60 seconds. After sandblasting , all specimens were luted using RelyX Ultimate Clicker. Half the specimens were subjected to µTBS tests at 24 hours , and the other half were subjected to tests after 5000 thermocycles. Additionally , a total of 96 CAD/CAM block sections were prepared for surface roughness tests and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) evaluations. The Mann-Whitney U test , Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance , and Dunn 's post hoc test were used to compare continuous variables among the groups. At baseline , group 1 , group 2 , and group 3 exhibited statistically similar µTBS results for LAVA. However , group 3 had significantly lower µTBS values than groups 1 and 2 for VITA. After 5000 thermocycles , µTBS values significantly decreased for each block ( It is important to perform controlled sandblasting because it may affect bond strength results. Sixty seconds of sandblasting disturbs the initial µTBS values and the stability of adhesion of CAD/CAM restoratives to dual-cure adhesive resin cement for VITA Enamic.
