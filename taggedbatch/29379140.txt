 Severe motor impairments can affect the ability to communicate. The ability to see has a decisive influence on the augmentative and alternative communication ( AAC) systems available to the user. To better understand the initial impressions users have of AAC systems we asked na√Øve healthy participants to compare two visual ( a visual P300 brain-computer interface ( BCI) and an eye-tracker) and two non-visual systems ( an auditory and a tactile P300 BCI). Eleven healthy participants performed 20 selections in a five choice task with each system. The visual P300 BCI used face stimuli , the auditory P300 BCI used Japanese Hiragana syllables and the tactile P300 BCI used a stimulator on the small left finger , middle left finger , right thumb , middle right finger and small right finger. The eye-tracker required a dwell time of 3 s on the target for selection. We calculated accuracies and information-transfer rates ( ITRs) for each control method using the selection time that yielded the highest ITR and an accuracy above 70 % for each system. Accuracies of 88 % were achieved with the visual P300 BCI ( 4.8 s selection time , 20.9 bits/min) , of 70 % with the auditory BCI ( 19.9 s , 3.3 bits/min) , of 71 % with the tactile BCI ( 18 s , 3.4 bits/min) and of 100 % with the eye-tracker ( 5.1 s , 28.2 bits/min). Performance between eye-tracker and visual BCI correlated strongly , correlation between tactile and auditory BCI performance was lower. Our data showed no advantage for either non-visual system in terms of ITR but a lower correlation of performance which suggests that choosing the system which suits a particular user is of higher importance for non-visual systems than visual systems.
