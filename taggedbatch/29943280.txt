 Palatability and patient acceptability are critical attributes of dispersible tablet formulation. Co-processed excipients could provide improved organoleptic profile due to rational choice of excipients and manufacturing techniques. The aim of this study was to identify the most suitable co-processed excipient to use within directly compressible dispersible tablet formulations. Nine excipients , selected based on successful manufacturability , were investigated in a randomised , preference and acceptability testing in 24 healthy adult volunteers. Excipients were classified in order of preference as follows ( from most preferred): SmartEx QD100 > F-Melt Type C > F-Melt Type M > MicroceLac > Ludiflash > CombiLac > Pharmaburst 500 > Avicel HFE-102 > Avicel PH-102. Broad differences were identified in terms of acceptability , with SmartEx QD100 being ` very acceptable ' , F-Melt Type C , F-Melt Type M and MicroceLac being ` acceptable ' , Ludiflash , CombiLac and Pharmaburst 500 being ` neutral ' and Avicel products being ` very unacceptable ' based on ratings using five-point hedonic scales. Organoleptic differences were ascribed to different composition and physical properties of excipients , resulting in dissimilar taste and mouth-feel. Excipients with particle size in water larger than 200-250 Î¼m were considered poorly acceptable , which supports the use of this value as a threshold for maximum particle size of dispersible formulation. The most promising co-processed excipients for directly compressible dispersible tablets were successfully identified.
