 Timing disturbances have being proposed as a key component of schizophrenia pathogenesis. However , the contribution of cognitive impairment to such disorders has not been clarified. Here , we investigated duration estimation and predictive timing in 30 patients with DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia ( SZ) compared to 30 healthy controls ( HC). Duration estimation was examined in a temporal and colour discrimination task , fully controlled for working memory ( WM) and attention requirements , and by more traditional temporal production and temporal bisection tasks. Predictive timing was measured in a temporal and spatial orienting of attention task. Expectations about stimulus onset ( temporal condition) or location ( spatial condition) were induced by valid and invalid symbolic cues. Results showed that discrimination of temporal and colour stimulus attributes was equally impaired in SZ. This , taken with the positive correlation between temporal bisection performance and neuropsychological measures of WM , indicates that duration estimation impairments in SZ are underpinned by WM dysfunction. Conversely , we found dissociation in temporal and spatial predictive ability in SZ. Unlike controls , patients were selectively unperturbed by events appearing at an unexpected moment in time , though were perturbed by targets appearing at an unexpected location. Moreover , patients were able to generate temporal expectations more implicitly , as their performance was influenced by the predictive nature of the flow of time itself. Our findings shed new light on the debate over the specificity of timing distortions in SZ , providing evidence that predictive timing is a precise marker of SZ , more sensitive than duration estimation , serving as a valid heuristic for studying the pathophysiology of the disorder.
