 It is challenging to balance work and life , and little attention has been paid to the work-life balance<symptom> and psychosocial well-being of South Koreans. We assessed the association between work-life balance<symptom> and psychosocial well-being among paid Korean workers. This study was based on data from the fourth Korean Working Conditions Survey. We evaluated only paid workers , which constituted 30,649 of the total of 50,007 subjects surveyed. Poor<symptom> work-life balance<symptom> was defined based on the goodness of fit between working hours and social commitments. Well-being was measured using the World Health Organization WHO-5 index. Poisson regression with robust variances was used to calculate the estimated prevalence ratios ( PRs) with confidence intervals. Poor<symptom> work-life balance<symptom> was associated with poor psychosocial well-being ( PR = 1.25; 95 % CI 1.21 to 1.28) even after adjusting for work-related and individual characteristics. Poor<symptom> well-being was associated with low-level job autonomy ( PR = 1.06; 95 % CI 1.03 to 1.09) , working for ≥ 53 h per week ( PR = 1.10; 95 % CI 1.06 to 1.14) , blue-collar status ( PR = 1.16; 95 % CI 1.11 to 1.21) , low-level support at work ( PR = 1.32; 95 % CI 1.29 to 1.36) , age ≥ 50 years ( PR = 1.21; 95 % CI 1.15 to 1.26) , the female gender ( 95 % CI PR = 1.04; 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.07) , and cohabitation ( living with somebody) ( PR = 1.08; 95 % CI 1.04 to 1.12). Good well-being was associated with high-intensity work ( PR = 0.96; 95 % CI 0.94 to 0.99) , being the secondary earner in a household ( PR = 0.82; 95 % CI 0.79 to 0.85) , and higher income ( PR = 0.75; 95 % CI 0.71 to 0.79). Work-life balance<symptom> was associated with psychosocial well-being after adjusting for both work-related and individual characteristics.
