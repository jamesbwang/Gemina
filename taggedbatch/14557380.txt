 Morphine-6-O-sulfate ( M6S) is as a mixed-action mu/delta ( μ/δ) opioid receptor agonist with high potency and analgesic efficacy. These studies used assays of drug discrimination and schedule-controlled responding to assess abuse-liability , tolerance , and physical dependence as compared to morphine in rats. Attempts to train 0.3 mg/kg ( IP) M6S from saline failed , but all rats rapidly acquired the discrimination when the training dose was changed to 3.0 mg/kg morphine , and substitution tests showed that morphine and fentanyl both fully substituted for the training dose , M6S and M3A6S ( 3-O-acetyl ester of M6S) only partially substituted , and salvinorin A did not elicit morphine-like effects. Tolerance to response rate-decreasing effects was studied in rats administered either 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg morphine or M6S before food-reinforced operant sessions. At both unit doses , tolerance to M6S-elicited rate suppression developed more slowly than tolerance to morphine-induced reductions in response rates. To assess dependence , rats were maintained on 1.0 mg/kg morphine or 1.0 mg/kg M6S until food-reinforced response rates were stable for at least 5 days. Rats were then administered saline or increasing doses of the opioid antagonist naltrexone ( NTX) ( 0.3 , 1.0 , 3.0 , or 10.0 mg/kg) in order to determine antagonist-precipitated withdrawal. NTX precipitated withdrawal was similar in both morphine-maintained and M6S-maintained rats. In conclusion , the mixed μ/δ agonist activity of M6S failed to completely protect against the development of physical dependence , but delayed tolerance development to behavioral effects and resulted in decreased morphine-like subjective effects , perhaps implying a decreased abuse liability over μ agonists.
