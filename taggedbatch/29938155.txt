 We use a set of ground-based instruments ( Global Positioning System receivers , ionosondes , magnetometers) along with data of multiple satellite missions ( Swarm , C/NOFS , DMSP , GUVI) to analyze the equatorial and low-latitude electrodynamic and ionospheric disturbances caused by the geomagnetic storm of 22-23 June 2015 , which is the second largest storm in the current solar cycle. Our results show that at the beginning of the storm , the equatorial electrojet ( EEJ) and the equatorial zonal electric fields were largely impacted by the prompt penetration electric fields ( PPEF). The PPEF were first directed eastward and caused significant ionospheric uplift and positive ionospheric storm on the dayside , and downward drift on the nightside. Furthermore , about 45 min after the storm commencement , the interplanetary magnetic field ( IMF) Bz component turned northward , leading to the EEJ changing sign to westward , and to overall decrease of the vertical total electron content ( VTEC) and electron density on the dayside. At the end of the main phase of the storm , and with the second long-term IMF Bz southward turn , we observed several oscillations of the EEJ , which led us to conclude that at this stage of the storm , the disturbance dynamo effect was already in effect , competing with the PPEF and reducing it. Our analysis showed no significant upward or downward plasma motion during this period of time; however , the electron density and the VTEC drastically increased on the dayside ( over the Asian region). We show that this second positive storm was largely influenced by the disturbed thermospheric conditions.
