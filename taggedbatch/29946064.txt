 In recent years , the organic light-emitting diode ( OLED) technology has been a rapidly evolving field of research , successfully making the transition to commercial applications such as mobile phones and other small portable devices. OLEDs provide efficient generation of light , excellent color quality , and allow for innovative display designs , e.g. , curved shapes , mechanically flexible and/or transparent devices. Especially their self emissive nature is a highly desirable feature for display applications. In this work , we demonstrate an approach for full-color OLED pixels that are fabricated by vertical stacking of a red- , green- , and blue-emitting unit. Each unit can be addressed separately which allows for efficient generation of every color that is accessible by superpositioning the spectra of the individual emission units. Here , we use a combination of time division multiplexing and pulse width modulation to achieve efficient color mixing. The presented device design requires only three independently addressable electrodes , simplifying both fabrication and electrical driving. The device is built in a top-emission geometry , which is highly desirable for display fabrication as the pixel can be directly deposited onto back-plane electronics. Despite the top-emission design and the application of three silver layers within the device , there is only a minor color shift even for large viewing angles. The color space spanned by the three emission sub-units exceeds the sRGB space , providing more saturated green/yellow/red colors. Furthermore , the electrical performance of each individual unit is on par with standard single emission unit OLEDs , showing very low leakage currents and achieving brightness levels above 1000 cd/m
