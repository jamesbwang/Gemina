 In the present study , a conserved Leishmania<pathogen> hypothetical protein , LiHyE , was evaluated for the serodiagnosis of leishmaniasis<disease>. Results showed that it presented high sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( PPV) , and negative predictive value ( NPV) to serologically identify visceral leishmaniasis<disease> ( VL) dogs when 40 positive sera and 95 cross-reactive samples were used. rLiHyE also showed the best results of sensitivity , specificity , PPV , and NPV to identify tegumentary leishmaniasis<disease> ( TL) and VL patients when 45 leishmaniasis<disease> patients ' sera and 90 cross-reactive samples were used. Results were better in comparison to those obtained when rA2 or Leishmania<pathogen> antigenic extract was employed as controls. The posttreatment follow-up showed that rLiHyE-specific antibodies declined significantly after the end of treatments , and a predominance of the IgG2 subclass was found in comparison to IgG1 levels in both TL and VL patients. In conclusion , rLiHyE can be considered a candidate for the serodiagnosis of canine and human leishmaniasis<disease>.
