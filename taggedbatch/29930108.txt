 A systems view of G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR) signaling in its native environment is central to the development of GPCR therapeutics with fewer side effects. Using the kappa opioid receptor ( KOR) as a model , we employed high-throughput phosphoproteomics to investigate signaling induced by structurally diverse agonists in five mouse brain regions. Quantification of 50,000 different phosphosites provided a systems view of KOR in vivo signaling , revealing novel mechanisms of drug action. Thus , we discovered enrichment of the mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR) pathway by U-50,488 H , an agonist causing aversion , which is a typical KOR-mediated side effect. Consequently , mTOR inhibition during KOR activation abolished aversion while preserving beneficial antinociceptive and anticonvulsant effects. Our results establish high-throughput phosphoproteomics as a general strategy to investigate GPCR in vivo signaling , enabling prediction and modulation of behavioral outcomes.
