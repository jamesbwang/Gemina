 To develop a triage-based screening algorithm and treatment order-sets aimed at improving the quality of care of all patients with sepsis<disease> presenting to our emergency department ( ED). Retrospective cohort study conducted during a pre-intervention period from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011 and a post-intervention period from 1 September 2014 to 30 April 2015. A large teaching hospital located in Toronto , Ontario , Canada with a 35-bed ED. All patients meeting pre-specified sepsis<disease> criteria during the ED encounter. Process of care measures included time to assessment by emergency physician , lactate measurement , blood culture collection , fluid and antibiotic administration. Intensive care unit ( ICU) outcomes including admissions , length of stay ( LOS) and deaths were reviewed. There were 346 patients pre-intervention , and 270 patients post-intervention. We significantly improved all process measures including mean time to antibiotics by 60 min ( P = 0.003) and proportion of patients receiving fluid resuscitation ( 64.7 % vs. 94.4 % , P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the number of patients admitted to ICU ( P = 0.14). The median ICU LOS was shorter in the post-intervention group ( 2.0 days ( interquartile range ( IQR) 1.0-4.5 days) vs. 5.0 days ( IQR 1.5-10.8 days) , P = 0.04) , and there was no difference in in-hospital mortality between groups ( P = 0.27). We have demonstrated that a triage-based sepsis<disease> screening tool results in expedited and consistent delivery of care , with a significant improvement in initial resuscitation measures.
