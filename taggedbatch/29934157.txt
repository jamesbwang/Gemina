 Boscalid is an agrochemical recently developed for crop protection and the most significant member of the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor group of fungicides. In this study , a collection of high-affinity monoclonal antibodies was generated to boscalid. By using a series of haptens with a linker at alternative tethering sites of the boscalid framework , specific antibodies were isolated as well as antibodies that also recognized the main boscalid metabolite. Two immunoassays were developed using different ELISA formats. Optimized assays displayed very high sensitivities ( limits of detection were near 0.01 µg/L). Trueness and precision for the determination of the target analyte in strawberry samples was evaluated. Moreover , immunoassay performance was validated with a reference chromatographic method using QuEChERS extracts of fruits from fungicide-treated crops. A monitoring study with strawberry samples from local markets was carried out by immunoassay , showing an occurrence of boscalid of 15 % with a maximum residue concentration of 43µg/kg.
