 Preservation of plant virus is a fundamental requirement in all types of virus-related research and applied applications. Development of efficient , reliable strategies for long-term preservation of plant virus would largely assist these studies. The present study reported a novel biotechnology allowing cryopreservation of Apple stem grooving virus ( ASGV) in living shoot tips. Following cryopreservation by droplet-vitrification or encapsulation-dehydration , about 62-67 % of shoot regrowth and 100 % of ASGV cryopreservation were obtained. Although shoot proliferation and virus concentration were reduced in cryopreserved diseased shoots after 8 weeks of shoot regeneration , continuous subculture for 4 times ( 16 weeks) increased shoot proliferation and virus concentration to comparative levels as those produced by shoot tip culture ( as a control to shoot tip cryopreservation). Cryopreserved ASGV was efficiently transmitted to a woody plant by micrografting and to a herbaceous indicator by mechanical inoculation. Gene sequencing in three fragments of ASGV genome including coat protein and movement protein showed that cryopreserved ASGV shared 99.87 % nucleotide identities with shoot tip culture-preserved virus , indicating cryopreserved virus is genetically stable. The present study demonstrates ASGV , a representative virus that can infect meristematic cells of shoot tips , can be efficiently cryopreserved in shoot tips. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report on plant virus cryopreservation in living tissues , and has great potential applications to long-term preservation of plant viruses.
