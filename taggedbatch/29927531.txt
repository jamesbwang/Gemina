 In the present study , we demonstrate the use of a disposable luciferase-based microfluidic bioassay chip for environmental monitoring and methods for fabrication. The designed microfluidic system includes a chamber with immobilized enzymes of bioluminescent bacteria Photobacterium<pathogen> leiognathi and Vibrio fischeri<pathogen> and their substrates , which dissolve after the introduction of the water sample and thus activate bioluminescent reactions. Limits of detection for copper ( II) sulfate , 1,3-dihydroxybenzene and 1,4-benzoquinone for the proposed microfluidic biosensor measured 3 μM , 15 mM , and 2 μM respectively , and these values are higher or close to the level of conventional environmental biosensors based on lyophilized bacteria. Approaches for entrapment of enzymes on poly ( methyl methacrylate) ( PMMA) plates using a gelatin scaffold and solvent bonding of PMMA chip plates under room temperature were suggested. The proposed microfluidic system may be used with some available luminometers and future portable luminescence readers.
