 Owing to the capability of integrating the information storage and computing in the same physical location , in-memory computing with memristors has become a research hotspot as a promising route for non von Neumann architecture. However , it is still a challenge to develop high performance devices as well as optimized logic methodologies to realize energy-efficient computing. Herein , filamentary Cu/GeTe/TiN memristor is reported to show satisfactory properties with nanosecond switching speed ( < 60 ns) , low voltage operation ( < 2 V) , high endurance ( > 10
