 A tube dysfunction is a common medical issue and can promote chronic<disease> otitis<disease> media<disease>. With the implementation of the Balloon dilation a treatment of the chronic tube dysfunction was set. In the present study significance of this method was assessed , especially questioning the success in practical terms of tympanic membrane retraction. In a retrospective study , in a period of assessment from 2011 until 2016 , the data of 81 patients , who underwent Balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube due to chronic tube dysfunction with regard to a preoperative presence of tympanic membrane retraction were evaluated. The success of the Balloon dilation was judged due to the capability of a postoperative SVT- Test and the patients ' self-assessment. With an average postoperative period of four months , the data of 13 patients were analyzed based on presence of pre- and postoperative tympanic membrane retraction. The treatment occurred at all cases without complications. In patients with chronic tube dysfunction the method revealed an improvement of 46 % , while 31 % of the patients with tympanic membrane retraction showed an improvement of the middle ear ventilation. Subjectively perceived 54 % of the patients marked an improvement of their clinical symptoms. In spite of a self-assessed improvement in 54 % only 31 % of the patients with chronic membrane retraction showed an objectively measurable success. To evaluate the question if combination with other middle ear surgeries shows better results , further studies , including more patients and data , are required.
