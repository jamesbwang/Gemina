 The sonic hedgehog pathway ( Shh) plays a central role in maintaining stem cell function and behaviour in various processes related to self-renewal and tissue regeneration. However , the therapeutic effect of Shh on mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESCs) has not yet been clearly elucidated. Thus , we investigated the effect of Shh on the regulation of mESC behaviour as well as the effect of Shh-pretreated mESCs in skin wound<disease><symptom> healing. The underlying mechanisms of Shh signalling pathway in growth and motility of mESCs were investigated using Western blot analysis , a cell proliferation assay and cell migration assay. In addition , the effect of Shh-pretreated mESCs in skin wound<disease><symptom> healing was determined using a mouse excisional wound<disease><symptom> splinting model. Shh disrupted the adherens junction through proteolysis by activating MMPs. In addition , the release of β-catenin from adherens junctions mediated by Shh led to cell cycle-dependent mESC proliferation. Shh-mediated Gli1 expression led to integrin β1 up-regulation , followed by FAK and Src phosphorylation. Furthermore , among the Rho-GTPases , Rac1 and Cdc42 were activated in a Shh-dependent manner while F-actin expression was suppressed by Rac1 and Cdc42 siRNA transfection. Consistent with the in vitro results , the skin wound<disease><symptom> healing assay revealed that Shh-treated mESCs increased angiogenesis and skin wound<disease><symptom> repair compared to that in Shh-treated mESCs transfected with integrin β1 siRNA in vivo. Our results imply that Shh induces adherens junction disruption and integrin β1-dependent F-actin formation by a mechanism involving FAK/Src and Rac1/Cdc42 signalling pathways in mESCs.
