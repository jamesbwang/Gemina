 The calcaneus is a rare location for the occurrence and development of primary tumour types. Clinicians are unfamiliar with calcaneal tumour types , which may result in a delay in diagnosis or a missed diagnosis , resulting in unnecessary morbidity and amputation. Heel pain and localized swelling of the ankle are the most common symptoms. X-ray is the first choice for a tentative diagnosis of a calcaneal tumour. The final diagnosis depends on a histological examination. The treatment of calcaneal tumour types varies depending on the Enneking system. The majority of patients with benign tumours heal , except for a few with a palindromia. For malignant tumours , the prognosis is comparatively poor , resulting in disability and a high rate of metastasis. This review describes the spectrum of calcaneal tumour types and specifically illustrates the epidemiology , symptomatology , imagology , histopathology and treatment options that may facilitate diagnosis and improve prognosis.
