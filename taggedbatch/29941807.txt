 In this study , electrochemical measurements , immersion tests , and slow strain rate tensile ( SSRT) tests were applied to investigate the electrochemical and stress corrosion cracking ( SCC) behavior of X70 steel in simulated seawater with the interference of different alternating current ( AC) densities. The results indicate that AC significantly strengthens the cathodic reaction , especially the oxygen reduction reaction. Simultaneously , hydrogen evolution reaction occurs when the limiting diffusion current density of oxygen reaches , and thus ,
