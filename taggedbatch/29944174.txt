 An increased implantations of cardiac implantable electronic devices ( CIED) is associated with a higher frequency of electrotherapy complications. The aim of the study to determine risk factors for late electrotherapy complications , evaluation of the effectiveness of transvenous lead extraction ( TLE) and survival after TLE. We analyzed the clinical data of 225 patients with electrotherapy complications qualified for TLE in single center in the years 2006-2015. Indications for TLE , risk factors for infectious complications , effectiveness of TLE , and survival after the procedure were assessed. In the study group , non-infectious indications for TLE predominated ( 78.2 %).. Analysis of risk of infectious complications demonstrated the important role of chronic renal<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HR = 1.842 , p = 0.034) and more CIED related procedures ( HR = 4.768 , p = 0.000). The high effectiveness of TLE and a significantly higher long-term mortality of patients with infectious complications ( 50 % vs 20 % , p < 0.05) were documented. The study demonstrated a high rate of qualification of patients with noninfectious complications for TLE and very high effectiveness of TLE. The worse long-term survival of patients with infectious complications , as well as increased risk of infectious complications due to the greater number of prior procedures should prompt consideration of early qualification for TLE in the case of dysfunction of the leads.
