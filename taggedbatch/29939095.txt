 Compare ablation versus partial nephrectomy ( PN) in T1A renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) treatment , using the SEER database. Patients with diagnosed T1A RCC from 2004 to 2013 were identified. Propensity matching paired subjects with similar background variables. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression were performed before and after matching. Cohort included 4592 patients ( 809 ablation , 3783 PN). PN compared with ablation group had significantly increased overall survival ( OS; 93.6 % vs 81.9 % 5-year survival; p < 0.0001) and cancer-specific survival ( CSS; p < 0.0001). After matching ( 1222 pairs) , PN group had significantly increased OS ( 91.0 % vs 86.3 % 5-year survival; p = 0.0457) but similar CSS ( p = 0.4023). Ablation offers similar CSS but lower OS as PN for T1A RCC in this SEER database.
