 To investigate the composition and diversity of heat resistant microorganisms in contaminated Chinese herbal pieces. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI-TOF-MS) protein fingerprinting and 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing of Illumina Miseq were used to analyze the heat resistant microbial community of 9 varieties of Chinese herbal pieces. Stem pieces ( Spatholobi Caulis , Tetrapanacis Medulla , Stachyuri Medulla) showed highest detection rate and most species of contaminants; However fruit pieces ( Schisandrae Sphenantherae Fructus) had the lowest detection rate and least species of contaminants; among root pieces , the detection rate and number of contaminants species were lower in Tuber Dioscoreae Persimilis and Rehmanniae Radix Praeparata. The heat resistant microbial community was mainly of Bacillaceae and Paenibacillaceae , and Bacillus showed the highest detection rate among them , followed by Brevibacillus , Paenibacillus<pathogen> , and Solibacillus. The rest genus in high-throughput sequencing analysis included Enterobacter<pathogen> , Brevundimonas , Leuconostoc , Methylobacterium , Dechloromonas , Pantoea , Klebsiella<pathogen> , and Erwinia. There were potential risk factors in heat resistant microbial community of Chinese herbal pieces , so we shall improve the microbial limit standard , strictly control the pathogenic bacteria in the product , and strengthen the supervision and management in production and circulation of Chinese herbal pieces.
