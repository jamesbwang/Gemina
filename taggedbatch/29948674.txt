 Herbicides with long residual period may increase the risk of environmental contamination. Adequate management of forage can reduce the half-life of the picloram , one of the most herbicides used in weed control. This study aims to determine the half-life of picloram , using high-performance liquid chromatography in a cultivated soil with Brachiaria brizantha trimmed or not. Brachiaria brizantha was cultivated in 60 pots filled with samples of oxisol , and 30 others were kept uncultivated with this forage. This plant was cut off close to the ground , after 60 days of emergency on 30 vessels. Picloram was applied in all of the plots. Soil samples were collected at 2 , 16 , 30 , 44 , 58 , 72 , 86 , 120 , 150 , and 180 days after the application of this herbicide. These samples were air-dried and stored at- 20 Â°C. Picloram was extracted by HPLC/UV-Vis detector. Half-life of this herbicide was calculated using kinetics models. The mere presence of roots in treatment with signalgrass cutoff did not reduce the concentrations of this herbicide , except when the emergence of new leaves occurred. The absence of B. brizantha cultivation in areas with application of picloram increases the risk of environmental contamination and successive crops due to the half-life of this herbicide. Brachiaria brizantha reduced half-life picloram and environmental risk in pastures. The validation method is suitable for determining picloram in low concentrations in soil.
