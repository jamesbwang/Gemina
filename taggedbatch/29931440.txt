 Sclerosed hemangioma is difficult to distinguish from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or liver metastasis due to their imaging resemblance , thus pathological diagnosis is often required; however , percutaneous biopsy entails a risk of dissemination if the tumor is malignant. Perflubutane , a contrast agent of ultrasonography , has a characteristic feature of being phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. Hepatic malignant lesions<symptom> contain few or no Kupffer cells , therefore , they are shown as a contrast defect. We report a case in which contrast enhanced ultrasonography ( CEUS) with perflubutane was useful to evaluate indications for percutaneous tumor biopsy. A 69-year-old woman had a hypoattenuating mass with slight enhancement in peripheral lesion<symptom> of the tumor in the arterial phase on dynamic computed tomography. From the arterial phase to the delayed phase , the hypoattenuating area was gradually and slightly enhanced , and peripheral enhancement also increased gradually , appearing as ring enhancement. We considered intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma , liver metastasis , and sclerosed hemangioma as differential diagnoses. Most of the tumor did not display contrast defects in the post-vascular phase on CEUS , therefore , we considered the possibility of malignancy was low and performed percutaneous biopsy. The tumor was diagnosed as sclerosed hemangioma. CEUS may be useful in evaluating indications for diagnostic percutaneous tumor biopsy.
