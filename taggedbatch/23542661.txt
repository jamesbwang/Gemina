 17Î²-estradiol ( E2) is an important sex steroid produced by ovary and brain. In mammals , E2 plays an important role in hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis to regulate puberty onset , however , little is known about the functional role of E2 in teleost pituitary. Using prepubertal grass carp as model , three nuclear estrogen receptors ( nERs: estrogen receptor alpha , estrogen receptor beta 1 , and estrogen receptor beta 2) and two G protein-coupled estrogen receptors ( GPER1: GPER1a and GPER1b) were isolated from grass carp pituitary. Tissue distribution analysis indicated that both nERs and GPERs were highly detected in grass carp pituitary , which suggested that E2 should play an important role in grass carp pituitary. Using primary cultured grass carp pituitary cells as model , high-throughput RNA-seq was used to examine the E2-induced differentially expressed genes ( DEGs). Transcriptomic analysis showed that E2 could significantly upregulate the expression of 28 genes in grass carp pituitary cells , which were characterized into different functions including reproduction , gonad development , and central nervous system development. Further studies confirmed that E2 could induce luteinizing hormone ( LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH) secretion and mRNA expression in prepubertal grass carp pituitary
