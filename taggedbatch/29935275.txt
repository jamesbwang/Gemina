 Psychological stresses such as social loss and separation during childhood induce hardship , referred to as emotional pain. These experiences are well-documented risk factors for the development of physical pain in adulthood. However , the underlying neuronal mechanisms of this exacerbation of pain are largely unknown , and consequently there is no effective pharmacotherapy. In this study , we sought to determine whether infant maternal separation ( MS) contributes to aggravation of neuropathic pain in adult mice. MS increased anxiety<symptom>- and depression-like behavioral responses to adult stress. In MS animals , chronic constriction injury ( CCI) heightened the sensory dimension of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> relative to that of control mice. However , MS mice treated with fluoxetine for 4 weeks after MS did not exhibit augmentation of allodynia , and their emotional response was attenuated. Microglia were more abundant in the spinal<disease> cord in MS/CCI mice than in control/CCI mice. These results suggest that emotional impairment is related to augmentation of neuropathic pain , and that dysfunction of microglial activation contributes to heightened pain sensitivity.
