 Increasing evidence has suggested that bidirectional regulation of cell proliferation is one important effect of TGF-β1 in wound<disease><symptom> healing. Increased c-Ski expression plays a role in promoting fibroblast proliferation at low TGF-β1 concentrations , but the mechanism by which low TGF-β1 concentrations regulate c-Ski levels remains unclear. In this study , the proliferation of rat primary fibroblasts was assessed with an ELISA BrdU kit. The mRNA and protein expression and phosphorylation levels of corresponding factors were measured by RT-qPCR , immunohistochemistry or Western blotting. We first found that low TGF-β1 concentrations not only promoted c-ski mRNA and protein expression in rat primary fibroblasts but also increased the phosphorylation levels of Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases ( ERK) and cAMP response element binding ( CREB) protein. An ERK kinase ( mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase , MEK) inhibitor significantly inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels , markedly reducing c-Ski expression and CREB phosphorylation levels and abrogating the growth-promoting effect of low TGF-β1 concentrations. At the same time , Smad2/3 phosphorylation levels were not significantly changed. Taken together , these results suggest that the increased cell proliferation induced by low TGF-β1 concentrations mediates c-Ski expression potentially through the ERK/CREB pathway rather than through the classic TGF-β1/ Smad pathway.
