 We report a case of severe lupus myocarditis<disease> with rapid , acute deterioration to cardiogenic shock<symptom> and multiorgan failure , highlighting the importance of early identification and treatment of acute presentations in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. A 31-year-old woman with previously diagnosed subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus initially presented with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and frank per-rectal bleeding. She deteriorated rapidly with type 1 respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis secondary to acute cardiac failure with a prolonged intensive care unit admission , over a month. A significantly elevated troponin , global hypokinesia on echocardiogram and normal coronary artery angiogram and cardiac MRI lead to the diagnosis of acute lupus myocarditis<disease> as the cause for the cardiogenic shock<symptom>. She was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and eventually made a full recovery , with cardiac function returning to normal.
