 Pediatric psychiatric emergency care is delivered in different settings with vastly different resources around the country. Training programs lack guidance on developing optimal curricula for this highly variable but crucial setting. A model curriculum for child and adolescent psychiatry trainees may be helpful to provide such guidance; its components include recommendations for assessing baseline knowledge , identifying and teaching core subject content , encouraging development of essential skills , and building in supervision for learners. Future directions include further study in current pediatric emergency psychiatry education and expanding the scope of curricula to include different learners and delivery models.
