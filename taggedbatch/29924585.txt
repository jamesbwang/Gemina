 The anodic oxygen evolution reaction ( OER) is central to various energy conversion devices , but the investigation of the dynamic evolution of catalysts in different OER conditions remains quite limited , which is unfavorable for the understanding of the actual structure-activity relationship and catalyst optimization. Herein , we constructed monodispersed IrNi
