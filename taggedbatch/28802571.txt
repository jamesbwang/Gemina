 Coronary heart disease ( CHD) and mental illness are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Decades of research has revealed several , and sometimes surprising , links between CHD and mental illness , and has even suggested that both may actually cause one another. However , the precise nature of these links has not yet been clearly established. The goal of this paper , therefore , is to comprehensively review and discuss the state-of-the-art nature of the epidemiological and pathophysiological aspects of the bidirectional links between mental illness and CHD. This review demonstrates that there exists a large body of epidemiological prospective data showing that people with severe mental illness , including schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , and major depressive disorder , as a group , have an increased risk of developing CHD , compared with controls ( adjusted hazard ratio ( adjHR) = 1.54; 95 % CI: 1.30-1.82 ,
