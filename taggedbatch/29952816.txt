 Despite careful clinical examination , procurement biopsy and assessment on hypothermic machine perfusion ( HMP) , a significant number of potentially useable deceased donor kidneys will be discarded because they are deemed unsuitable for transplantation. Ex vivo normothermic perfusion ( EVNP) may be useful as a means to further assess high-risk kidneys to determine suitability for transplantation. From June 2014 to October 2015 , 7 kidneys ( mean donor age 54.3 years and KDPI 79 %) that were initially procured with the intention to transplant were discarded based on a combination of clinical findings , suboptimal biopsies , long cold ischemia time and/or poor hypothermic perfusion parameters. They were subsequently placed on EVNP using oxygenated packed red blood cells and supplemental nutrition for a period of 3 hours. Continuous hemodynamic and functional parameters were assessed. After a mean cold ischemia time ( CIT) of 43.7 hours , all 7 kidneys appeared viable on EVNP with progressively increasing renal<symptom> blood flow over the 3-hour period of perfusion. Five of the 7 kidneys had excellent macroscopic appearance , rapid increase in blood flow to 200-250 ml/min , urine output of 40-260 ml/hr and increasing creatinine clearance. Favorable perfusion characteristics and immediate function after a 3 hour course of EVNP suggests that high-risk kidneys subjected to long CIT may have been considered for transplantation. The combined use of ex vivo hypothermic and normothermic perfusion may be a useful strategy to more adequately assess and preserve high-risk kidneys deemed unsuitable for transplantation. A clinical trial will be necessary to validate the usefulness of this approach.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
