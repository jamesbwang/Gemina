 Many of the medications prescribed to children are off-label and/or unlicensed because pharmacologic evaluations have not been performed in this age group. All drugs prescribed to patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care units ( NICU) ( n = 134) and pediatric intensive care units ( PICU) ( n = 56) during a 2-month observation period were recorded and classified according to patient age , drug license status , indicated use , and typical dosing , frequency and way of administration. Results were compared with prior data collected in 2002 , from the same units. In the NICU , among the 1064 prescriptions for 49 medications , 312 ( 29.2 %) were licensed and 63 ( 5.9 %) unlicensed , and 693 ( 64.8 %) were off-label use. For the neonates , 23.9 % and 96.3 % received at least one unlicensed medication and one off-label medication , respectively. While the difference in off-label use between the two time periods was not statistically significant , unlicensed medications were less frequently prescribed in 2016 ( 5.9 versus 16.6 % , p = 0.001). Regarding the PICU , among the 388 prescriptions for 75 medications , 205 ( 52 %) were licensed and 13 ( 3.4 %) unlicensed , and 170 ( 43.8 %) were off-label. In contrast , in 2002 , none of the medications prescribed were unlicensed ( p = 0.001). The number of off-label medications ( 41 %) and number of PICU patients receiving at least one unlicensed/off-label medication in these two time periods ( 88.7 % versus 90.5 % for 2016 and 2002 , respectively) were similar. The current study confirms the high prevalence of unlicensed and off-label drug use in a PICU and NICU setting. Compared with a similar study conducted in the same PICU in 2002 , despite regulatory efforts conducted in this area , the prevalence of unlicensed medications was surprisingly higher.
