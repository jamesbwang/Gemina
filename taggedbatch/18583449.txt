 In this paper , I explore what happens when self-tracking technologies and devices travel into the context of physical rehabilitation and come to constitute what Lupton has called ` pushed ' self-tracking. By unpacking the processes through which a self-tracking technology is put to use in physical rehabilitation in Denmark , and the kind of relationships patients and healthcare providers establish with and through this technology , I illustrate how a new geography of responsibility is constituted , where responsibility for professional guidance is delegated to the technology and patients are expected to produce and engage in movement data. In contrast to the image of ` pushing ' as a single activity where one part ( technology) has the authority to push the other ( patient) to act in certain ways , I argue that ` the push ' is better described as an ongoing and contingent process that evolves through affective and affecting encounters between human ( patients , healthcare providers) and nonhuman ( technology , algorithms , software) actors. I illustrate that even though responsibility is delegated to the technology , it is unable to make bodies move by itself. Rather , what determines what ` it ' becomes and how ` it ' comes to act is enabled by the constitution of a wider arrangement of care and the arrangements ' ability to affect and respond to particular bodies.
