 Transient lateral patellar dislocation ( TLPD) is a common lesion<symptom> in young adults. Vascular injury as a complication of TLPD has not been previously described. We report a case of descending genicular artery ( DGA) injury after TLPD. Immediate angiography demonstrated rupture of DGA. Embolization was performed with sudden interruption of bleeding. DGA injury should be considered as a complication after TLPD and prompt diagnosis and intervention are required. We propose selective embolization as a safe and effective procedure to stop bleeding.
