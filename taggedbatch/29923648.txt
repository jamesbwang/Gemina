 Bacteria regulate cell physiology in response to extra- and intracellular cues. Recent work showed that metabolic fluxes are reported by specific metabolites , whose concentrations correlate with flux through the respective metabolic pathway. An example of a flux-signaling metabolite is fructose-1,6-bisphosphate ( FBP). In turn , FBP was proposed to allosterically regulate master regulators of carbon metabolism , Cra in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and CggR in Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen>. However , a number of questions on the FBP-mediated regulation of these transcription factors is still open. Here , using thermal shift assays and microscale thermophoresis we demonstrate that FBP does not bind Cra , even at millimolar physiological concentration , and with electrophoretic mobility shift assays we also did not find FBP-mediated impairment of Cra 's affinity for its operator site , while fructose-1-phosphate does. Furthermore , we show for the first time that FBP binds CggR within the millimolar physiological concentration range of the metabolite , and decreases DNA-binding activity of this transcription factor. Molecular docking experiments only identified a single FBP binding site CggR. Our results provide the long thought after clarity with regards to regulation of Cra activity in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and reveals that E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> use distinct cellular mechanism to transduce glycolytic flux signals into transcriptional regulation.
