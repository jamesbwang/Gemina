 The development of small protein tags that exhibit bioorthogonality , bond stability , and reversibility , as well as biocompatibility , holds great promise for applications in cellular environments enabling controlled drug delivery or for the construction of dynamic protein complexes in biological environments. Herein , we report the first application of dynamic covalent chemistry both for purification and for reversible assembly of protein conjugates using interactions of boronic acid with diols and salicylhydroxamates. Incorporation of the boronic acid ( BA) tag was performed in a site-selective fashion by applying disulfide rebridging strategy. As an example , a model protein enzyme ( lysozyme) was modified with the BA tag and purified using carbohydrate-based column chromatography. Subsequent dynamic covalent `` click-like '' bioconjugation with a salicylhydroxamate modified fluorescent dye ( BODIPY FL) was accomplished while retaining its original enzymatic activity.
