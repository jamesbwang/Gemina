 Achalasia is an uncommon condition characterised by failed lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation. Data regarding its incidence , prevalence , disease associations and long-term outcomes are very limited. Hospital Episode Statistics ( HES) include demographic and diagnostic data for all English hospital attendances. The Health Improvement Network ( THIN) includes the primary care records of 4.5 million UK subjects , representative of national demographics. Both were searched for incident cases between 2006 and 2016 and THIN for prevalent cases. Subjects with achalasia in THIN were compared with age , sex , deprivation tand smoking status matched controls for important comorbidities and mortality. There were 10509 and 711 new achalasia diagnoses identified in HES and THIN , respectively. The mean incidence per 100000 people in HES was 1.99 ( 95 % CI 1.87 to 2.11) and 1.53 ( 1.42 to 1.64) per 100000 person-years in THIN. The prevalence in THIN was 27.1 ( 25.4 to 28.9) per 100000 population. Incidence rate ratios ( IRRs) were significantly higher in subjects with achalasia ( n = 2369) compared with controls ( n = 3865) for: oesophageal cancer ( IRR 5.22 ( 95 % CI: 1.88 to 14.45) , p < 0.001) , aspiration pneumonia<disease> ( 13.38 ( 1.66 to 107.79) , p = 0.015) , lower respiratory<disease><symptom> tract<symptom><disease> infection<disease> ( 1.33 ( 1.05 to 1.70) , p = 0.02) and mortality ( 1.33 ( 1.17 to 1.51) , p < 0.001). The median time from achalasia diagnosis to oesophageal cancer diagnosis was 15.5 ( IQR 20.4) years. The incidence of achalasia is 1.99 per 100000 population in secondary care data and 1.53 per 100000 person-years in primary care data. Subjects with achalasia have an increased incidence of oesophageal cancer , aspiration pneumonia<disease> , lower respiratory<disease><symptom> tract<symptom><disease> infections<disease> and higher mortality. Clinicians treating patients with achalasia should be made aware of these associated morbidities and its increased mortality.
