 We show that blister-based-laser-induced forward-transfer can be used to cleanly desorb and transfer nano- and micro-scale particles between substrates without exposing the particles to the laser radiation or to any chemical treatment that could damage the intrinsic electronic and optical properties of the materials. The technique uses laser pulses to induce the rapid formation of a blister on a thin metal layer deposited on glass via ablation at the metal/glass interface. Femtosecond laser pulses are advantageous for forming beams of molecules or small nanoparticles with well-defined velocity and narrow angular distributions. Both fs and ns laser pulses can be used to cleanly transfer larger nanoparticles including relatively fragile monolayer 2D transition metal dichalcogenide crystals and for direct transfer of nanoparticles from chemical vapour deposition growth substrates , although the mechanisms for inducing blister formation are different.
