 The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met , its ligand HGF , and components of the downstream signalling pathway , have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of myeloma , both as modulators of plasma cell proliferation and as agents driving osteoclast differentiation and osteoblast inhibition thus , all these contribute substantially to the bone destruction typically caused by myeloma. Patients with elevated levels of HGF have a poor prognosis , therefore , targeting these entities in such patients may be of substantial benefit. We hypothesized that ARQ-197 ( Tivantinib) , a small molecule c-Met inhibitor , would reduce myeloma cell growth and prevent myeloma-associated bone disease in a murine model. In vitro we assessed the effects of ARQ-197 on myeloma cell proliferation , cytotoxicity and c-Met protein expression in human myeloma cell lines. In vivo we injected NOD/SCID-Î³ mice with PBS ( non-tumour bearing) or JJN3 cells and treated them with either ARQ-197 or vehicle. In vitro exposure of JJN3 , U266 or NCI-H929 cells to ARQ-197 resulted in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation and an induction of cell death by necrosis<symptom> , probably caused by significantly reduced levels of phosphorylated c-Met. In vivo ARQ-197 treatment of JJN3 tumour-bearing mice resulted in a significant reduction in tumour burden , tumour cell proliferation , bone lesion<symptom> number , trabecular bone loss and prevented significant decreases in the bone formation rate on the cortico-endosteal bone surface compared to the vehicle group. However , no significant differences on bone parameters were observed in non-tumour mice treated with ARQ-197 compared to vehicle , implying that in tumour-bearing mice the effects of ARQ-197 on bone cells was indirect. In summary , these res ults suggest that ARQ-197 could be a promising therapeutic in myeloma patients , leading to both a reduction in tumour burden and an inhibition of myeloma-induced bone disease.
