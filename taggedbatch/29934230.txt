 The comparative effectiveness and safety of individual direct oral anticoagulants ( DOACs) in clinical practice is largely unknown. The study objectives were to compare effectiveness and safety of DOACs in patients with non-valvular atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( NVAF). Based on nationwide registers we established a population-based historical cohort study of 12,638 new users of standard dose DOACs ( apixaban 5 mg twice daily , dabigatran 150 mg twice daily and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily) with NVAF in Denmark , July 2013 to March 2016. Patients were matched on propensity scores in a 1:1 ratio comparing apixaban vs. dabigatran ( for a total of 6470 patients) , apixaban vs. rivaroxaban ( 7352 patients) , and rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran ( 5440 patients). Hazard ratios ( HRs) for stroke or systemic embolism ( effectiveness outcome) and major bleeding ( safety outcome) were estimated. In propensity-matched comparisons of the risk of stroke or systemic embolism , the HRs were 1.27 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.82-1.96) for apixaban vs. dabigatran , 1.25 ( 95 % CI , 0.87-1.79) for apixaban vs. rivaroxaban , and 1.17 ( 95 % CI , 0.69-1.96) for rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran. For the risk of major bleeding , the HRs were 0.94 ( 95 % CI , 0.62-1.41) for apixaban vs. dabigatran , 0.88 ( 95 % CI , 0.64-1.22) for apixaban vs. rivaroxaban , and 1.35 ( 95 % CI , 0.91-2.00) for rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran. Among patients with NVAF in routine clinical practice , there were no statistically significant differences in risk of stroke or systemic embolism or major bleeding in propensity-matched comparisons between apixaban , dabigatran , and rivaroxaban used in standard doses. While analyses indicate that more than moderate differences can be excluded , smaller differences can not be ruled out.
