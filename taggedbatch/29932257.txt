 Here , we described the outcome of thermal grafting of 2-ethynylaniline , 3-ethynylaniline and 4-ethynylaniline respectively on hydrogenated Si ( 100) surface. Using high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) and atomic force microscopy ( AFM) , it was found that the grafting of these compounds could be attributed to resonating structures that arises from the position of electron donating NH2 and the electron withdrawing acetylene group. For the ortho- and para-positioned acetylene group , surface reactions were observed to proceed predominantly via the acetylene to form a Si-C bond while the meta-positioned acetylene group was found to have undergone nucleophilic grafting through the NH2 onto the silicon surface to form Si-N bond. Furthermore , a BOC-protected derivative for a meta-positioned ethynylaniline was synthesized to exclusively forced the reaction with the acetylene group and subsequent analysis had confirmed that unprotected 3-ethynylaniline had indeed reacted via the nucleophilic NH2 group as hypothesized. Thus , for the first time in literature , the interplay between resonance structures and their effects on silicon surface modifications were systematically catalogued.
