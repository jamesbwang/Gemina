 Beryllate structures are marginally investigated , but show intriguing structural relations to oxo- and nitridosilicates. A typical feature is the coordination of Be in both trigonal planar and tetrahedral coordination by O. A broad range of structures is accessible by variable combinations of both building units. Three novel ternary Sr-oxoberyllates are characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis , density functional theory calculations and investigations on luminescence properties: Î±-SrBeO
