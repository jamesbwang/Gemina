 The microbiome is vital for immune system development and homeostasis. Changes in microbial composition and function , termed dysbiosis , in the skin and the gut have recently been linked to alterations in immune responses and to the development of skin diseases , such as atopic dermatitis<disease> ( AD). In this review , we summarize the recent findings on the gut and skin microbiome , highlighting the roles of major commensals in modulating skin and systemic immunity in AD. Although our understanding of the gut-skin axis is only beginning , emerging evidence indicates that the gut and skin microbiome could be manipulated to treat AD.
