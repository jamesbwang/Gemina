 Borneol ( BO) and menthol ( MEN) are two widely used natural permeation enhancers in the transdermal drug delivery system. In previous studies , their permeation enhancement effects and mechanisms of action on the hydrophobic drug osthole ( logP = 3.8) and hydrophilic drug 5-fluorouracil ( logP = -0.9) have been studied. In this study , ligustrazine ( LTZ) , whose logP is 1.3 , was used as a model drug to provide a comprehensive understanding of the influence of its logP on the permeation-enhancing effects of BO and MEN. Both BO and MEN enhanced the permeation of LTZ through the skin stratum corneum , as determined using the modified Franz diffusion cell experiment. The enhancement mechanisms were illustrated by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations as follows: at low concentrations , the enhancing ratio of MEN was higher than that of BO because of the stronger perturbation effects of MEN on the lipid bilayer , making it looser and facilitating LTZ diffusion. However , at high concentrations , in addition to the diffusion mechanism , BO induced the formation of water channels to improve the permeation of LTZ; however , MEN had no significant effects through this mechanism. Their results were different from those found with osthole and 5-fluorouracil and have been discussed in this study.
