 Bovine fasciolosis , caused by the infection of the trematode parasite Fasciola hepatica , remains a problem in dairy herds causing significant production losses<symptom>. In this study , bulk milk tank samples were utilised to generate a comprehensive survey of the variation in liver fluke exposure over the four seasons of 2016 in Northern Ireland ( NI). Samples were tested using an antibody ELISA test; within-herd prevalence levels were categorised relative to sample-to-positive ratio ( S/P %). Overall , 1494 herds ( ~ 50 % of all active dairy farms in NI) were sampled. In total , 5750 samples were tested with 91 % of herds having a sample result for each season. The proportion of herds with evidence of liver fluke exposure was very high across the year , with 93.03 % of all bulk milk samples having some indication of liver fluke antibody presence. A high proportion of samples ( 2187/5750; 38.03 %) fell within the highest infection class ( indicating high within-herd prevalence). There was significant seasonal variation in the mean S/P %. A multivariable random effect ordinal logit model suggested that the greatest probability of being in a higher infection class was in winter , whilst the lowest was recorded during summer. There was a significant negative association between increasing herd liver fluke infection class and herd size. Furthermore , there was significant variation in infection levels across regions of Northern Ireland , with higher infection levels in northern administrative areas. This study demonstrates the very high liver fluke exposure in this region of Europe , and that risk is not equally distributed spatially or across seasons in dairy herds.
