 Continuous electroencephalography ( CEEG) is chiefly performed at The Medical University of South Carolina ( MUSC) for identifying seizures<symptom> , including its refined use within the epilepsy monitoring unit ( EMU) as a differentiator between epileptic and psychogenic etiologies. CEEG also provides critical data that carry implications outside the bounds of both epilepsy and psychogenic events , such as the characterization of unorthodox clinical phenomena that are of physiological ( though nonepileptic) origins. Although nonepileptic events ( NEEs) are primarily linked with psychogenic phenomena ( conversion disorder , malingering) that can mimic epileptic activity , they , like seizures<symptom> , have diverse semiologies and etiologies. Although it is reasonable for seasoned neurodiagnostics professionals to develop an expectation that NEEs are of psychogenic origin , it is essential to acknowledge that they include etiologies that lay beyond those of psychiatric influence. Such a case is presented in which a 74-year-old female patient who , though initially suspected of having either psychogenic or epileptic<symptom> seizures<symptom> , was found to be having frequent episodes of the life-threatening cardiac convulsive syncope torsades de pointes ( TdP). The patient had several known risk factors for TdP , including a prolonged QT complex , female gender , advancing age , active medications known to provoke TdP , and electrolyte imbalances ( low magnesium and potassium) ( Trinkley et al. 2013). TdP was first suspected through the CEEG by a combination of remarkable EEG background changes , recorded video evidence of clinical features , and accompanying single-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG) data captured during the events. Upon proper diagnosis , the patient was urgently treated with restorative measures , including electrolyte replenishment , pacemaker implantation , and cessation of provocative medications.
