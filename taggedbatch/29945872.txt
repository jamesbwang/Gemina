 The plasma-protein histidine-rich glycoprotein ( HRG) is implicated in phenotypic switching of tumor-associated macrophages , regulating cytokine production and phagocytotic activity , thereby promoting vessel normalization and anti-tumor immune responses. To assess the therapeutic effect of HRG gene delivery on CNS tumors , we used adenovirus-encoded HRG to treat mouse intracranial GL261 glioma. Delivery of Ad5-HRG to the tumor site resulted in a significant reduction in glioma growth , associated with increased vessel perfusion and increased CD45 + leukocyte and CD8 + T cell accumulation in the tumor. Antibody-mediated neutralization of colony-stimulating factor-1 suppressed the effects of HRG on CD45 + and CD8 + infiltration. Using a novel protein interaction-decoding technology , TRICEPS-based ligand receptor capture ( LRC) , we identified Stanniocalcin-2 ( STC2) as an interacting partner of HRG on the surface of inflammatory cells in vitro and co-localization of HRG and STC2 in gliomas. HRG reduced the suppressive effects of STC2 on monocyte CD14 + differentiation and STC2-regulated immune response pathways. In consequence , Ad5-HRG treated gliomas displayed decreased numbers of Interleukin-35 + Treg cells , providing a mechanistic rationale for the reduction in GL261 growth in response to Ad5-HRG delivery. We conclude that HRG suppresses glioma growth by modulating tumor inflammation<symptom> through monocyte infiltration and differentiation. Moreover , HRG acts to balance the regulatory effects of its partner , STC2 , on inflammation<symptom> and innate and/or acquired immunity. HRG gene delivery therefore offers a potential therapeutic strategy to control anti-tumor immunity.
