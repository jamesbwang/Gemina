 Safety profile of the interaction between anticancer drugs and radiation is a recurrent question. However , there are little data regarding the non-anticancer treatment ( NACT)/ radiation combinations. The aim of the present study was to investigate concomitant NACTs in patients undergoing radiotherapy in a French comprehensive cancer center. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted. All cancer patients undergoing a palliative or curative radiotherapy were consecutively screened for six weeks in 2016. Data on NACTs were collected. Out of 214 included patients , a NACT was concomitantly prescribed to 155 patients ( 72 %) , with a median number of 5 NACTs per patient ( range: 1-12). The most prescribed drugs were anti-hypertensive drugs ( 101 patients , 47.2 %) , psychotropic drugs ( n = 74 , 34.6 %) , analgesics ( n = 78 , 36.4 %) , hypolipidemic drugs ( n = 57 , 26.6 %) , proton pump inhibitors ( n = 46 , 21.5 %) and antiplatelet drugs ( n = 38 , 17.8 %). Although 833 different molecules were reported , only 20 possible modifiers of cancer biological pathways ( prescribed to 74 patients ( 34.5 %)) were identified. Eight out of the 833 molecules ( 0.9 %) , belonging to six drug families , have been investigated in 28 ongoing or published clinical trials in combo with radiotherapy. They were prescribed to 63 patients ( 29.4 %). Drug-radiation interaction remains a subject of major interest , not only for conventional anticancer drugs , but also for NACTs. New trial designs are thus required.
