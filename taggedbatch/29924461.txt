 External counterpulsation improves cerebral perfusion velocity in acute stroke and may stimulate collateral artery growth. However , whether ( non-acute) at-risk patients with high-grade carotid artery disease may benefit from counterpulsation needs to be validated. Twenty-eight patients ( 71 ± 6.5 years , 5 women) with asymptomatic unilateral chronic severe ICA stenosis ( > 70 %) or occlusion were randomized to receive 20 min active counterpulsation followed by sham treatment or vice versa. Cerebral blood flow velocity ( CBFV , measured bilaterally by transcranial MCA Doppler) , tissue oxygenation index ( TOI , measured over the bilateral prefrontal cortex by near-infrared spectroscopy) and cerebral hemodynamic parameters , such as relative pulse slope index ( RPSI) , were monitored. Ipsilateral mean CBFV ( ΔV In patients with high-grade carotid disease , ipsilateral cerebral oxygenation and blood flow velocity is increased by counterpulsation. This is a necessary condition for the stimulation of regenerative collateral artery growth and thus a therapeutic concept for the prevention of cerebral ischemia. This study provides a rationale for further clinical investigations on longer-term effects of counterpulsation on cerebral hemodynamics and collateral growth. This article is protected by copyright.
