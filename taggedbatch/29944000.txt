 Total hip arthroplasty ( THA) improve the patients ' quality of life , and one of the most important problems after surgery is to optimize postoperative pain management. It has been shown that pain is intimately linked to the fear of movement , the so-called kinesiophobia , which can affect the entire perioperative period and quality of life in people undergoing THA. In this study , we aimed to present a new integrative approach called IARA model specifically focused on educational interventions such as knowledge and awareness of illness , guided imagery , and drawings to help the patient achieve full autonomy and confidence about the perioperative period and surgery. The Hip Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( HOOS) , Tampa Scale Kinesiophobia ( TSK) questionnaire , and Numeric Rating Scale 0-10 have been used to test the efficacy of IARA. The main finding in the present study was the effectiveness of IARA model in improving indexes of pain ( p < 0.01) and QoL ( p < 0.01) and to keep kinesiophobia levels low in patients undergoing THA.
