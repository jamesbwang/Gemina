 Cost-utility analysis of an annular closure device ( ACD) based on data from a prospective , multicenter randomized controlled trial ( RCT) OBJECTIVE.: Determine the cost-effectiveness of a novel ACD in a patient population at high risk for recurrent herniation following discectomy SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Lumbar disc herniation patients with annular defect widths ≥ 6 mm are at high risk for recurrent herniation following limited discectomy. Recurrent herniation is associated with worse clinical outcomes and greater healthcare costs. A novel ACD may reduce the incidence of recurrent herniation and the associated burdens. A decision analytical modeling approach with a Markov method was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the ACD versus conventional discectomy. Health states were created by projecting visual analogue scale ( VAS) onto Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI). Direct costs were calculated based on Humana and Medicare 2014 claims to represent private and public payer data , respectively. Indirect costs were calculated for lost work days using 2016 US average annual wages. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER) in dollars per quality adjusted life year ( QALY) was compared to willingness-to-pay ( WTP) thresholds. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted. Patients with the ACD had less symptomatic reherniations , reoperations , and complications and gained 0.0328 QALYs within the first 2 years. Total direct medical costs for the ACD group were similar to control. When productivity loss was considered , using the ACD became $ 2,076 cheaper , per patient , than conventional discectomy. Based on direct costs alone , the ICER comparing ACD to control equaled $ 6,030 per QALY. When indirect costs are included , the ICER became negative , which indicates that superior quality of life was attained at less cost. For lumbar disc herniations patients with annular defects ≥ 6 mm , the ACD was , at 2-years , a highly cost-effective surgical modality compared to conventional lumbar discectomy. 1This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
