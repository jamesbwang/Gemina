 DNA-encoded libraries ( DEL)- based discovery platforms have recently been widely adopted in the pharmaceutical industry , mainly due to their powerful diversity and incredible number of molecules. In the two decades since their disclosure , great strides have been made to expand the toolbox of reaction modes that are compatible with the idiosyncratic aqueous , dilute , and DNA-sensitive parameters of this system. However , construction of highly important C ( sp
