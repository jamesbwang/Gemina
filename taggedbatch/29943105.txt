 Volumetric absorptive microsampling ( VAMS) devices are useful for sampling a smaller volume of blood from rodents in the preclinical setting. In the present study , we evaluated the proof of concept of a VAMS device by comparing the pharmacokinetic data of tacrolimus in rats among dried blood in VAMS , wet blood , and plasma. Tacrolimus was administered orally , to rats , at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Only 10 μL aliquots of blood were absorbed by VAMS devices at designated time points. Tacrolimus was extracted with a methanol-water mixture ( 1:1 , v/v) via sonication. Tacrolimus levels in wet blood ( 10 μL) and plasma ( 10 μL) were quantified after protein precipitation. Tacrolimus in VAMS devices was quantifiable from 0.2 ng/mL using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometer. Accuracy and precision were within the acceptance criteria. Bland-Altman plots showed that tacrolimus concentrations in VAMS devices were similar to those in wet blood , regardless of tacrolimus levels. On the other hand , tacrolimus levels in plasma were different from those in VAMS devices , especially at lower concentrations , likely due to partition of tacrolimus to blood cells. However , pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable among the three matrices. Collectively , these findings suggest that the VAMS device can be a useful device for pharmacokinetic studies in rats.
