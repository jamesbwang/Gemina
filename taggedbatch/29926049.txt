 TiS3 nanosheets have proven to be promising candidates for ultrathin optoelectronic devices due to their direct narrow band-gap and the strong light-matter interaction. In addition , the marked in-plane anisotropy of TiS3 is appealing for the fabrication of polarization sensitive optoelectronic devices. Herein , we study the optical contrast of TiS3 nanosheets of variable thickness on SiO2/Si substrates , from which we obtain the complex refractive index in the visible spectrum. We find that TiS3 exhibits very large birefringence , larger than that of well-known strong birefringent materials like TiO2 or calcite , and linear dichroism. These findings are in qualitative agreement with ab initio calculations that suggest an excitonic origin for the birefringence and linear dichroism of the material.
