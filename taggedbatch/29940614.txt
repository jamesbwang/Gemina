 Hyaluronic acid ( HA) is a natural glycosaminoglycan found in the extracellular matrix of most connective tissues. Due to its chemical structure , HA is a hydrophilic polymer and it is characterized by a fast degradation rate. HA-based scaffolds for tissue engineering are intensively studied due to their increased biocompatibility , biodegradability and chemical modification. Depending on the processing technique , scaffolds can be prepared in the form of hydrogels , sponges , cryogels , and injectable hydrogels , all discussed in this review.
