 Heterosexual attitudes toward individuals with other sexual orientations and identities , such as lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , intersex , asexual , etc. ( LGBTQIA +) have been conceptualized as multidimensional and wide ranging. With the objective of measuring these attitudes , Worthington and colleagues developed the Lesbian , Gay , and Bisexual Knowledge and Attitudes Scale for Heterosexuals ( LGB-KASH). In this article , 540 college students were administered the LGB-KASH; these data were examined for their psychometric properties of the instrument using a sequential approach. The first step included descriptive analysis including internal consistency measures and association rules , followed by the evaluation of dimension structure with factor analysis ( confirmatory/exploratory) , and finally , item analysis using non-parametric ( Mokken scale analysis) and parametric approaches ( Item Response Theory). Specific to the LGB-KASH factor structure , the current structure was not supported by these data; however , alternative subsets of items that could be used to revise the original instrument to obtain a more psychometrically sound measure are suggested.
