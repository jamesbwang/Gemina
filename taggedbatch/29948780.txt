 The variability in progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) among patients with epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC) makes it difficult to reliably predict outcomes. A predictive biomarker of bevacizumab efficacy as first-line therapy in EOC is still lacking. The MITO group conducted a multicenter , retrospective study ( MITO 24) to investigate the role of inflammatory indexes as prognostic factors and predictors of treatment efficacy in FIGO stage III-IV EOC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy alone or in combination with bevacizumab. Of the 375 patients recruited , 301 received chemotherapy alone and 74 received chemotherapy with bevacizumab. The pre-treatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR) , platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio ( PLR) , and systemic immune inflammation<symptom> index ( SII) were evaluated to identify a potential correlation with PFS and OS in both the overall population and the two treatment arms. In the overall population , the PFS and OS were significantly longer in patients with low<symptom> inflammatory indexes ( p < 0.0001). In multivariate analyses , the NLR was significantly associated with OS ( p = 0.016) , and the PLR was significantly associated with PFS ( p = 0.024). Inflammatory indexes were significantly correlated with patient prognosis in the chemotherapy-alone group ( p < 0.0001). Patients in the chemotherapy with bevacizumab group with a high NLR had a higher PFS and OS ( p = 0.026 and p = 0.029 , respectively) than those in the chemotherapy-alone group. Conversely , PFS and OS were significantly poorer in patients with a high SII ( p = 0.024 and p = 0.017 , respectively). Our results suggest that bevacizumab improves clinical outcome in patients with a high NLR but may be detrimental in those with a high SII.
