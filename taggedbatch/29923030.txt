 We present a case of a toxic reaction in both eyes caused by secretions from an encrusting anemone of the genus Protopalythoa. The patient presented with chemosis and follicular reaction of the conjunctiva and whitish spots on the limbus. Under local treatment with steroids and antibiotic eyedrops , remission was achieved within a few days. Palytoxin , a poisonous component of Protopalythoa secretions , leads to inhibition of the sodium-potassium-ATPase , to destabilization of the membrane potential and to cell death. Ocular exposure can lead to severe anatomical and functional impairments with systemic symptoms.
