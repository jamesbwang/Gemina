 TCR/CD3 complex is composed of the disulfide-linked TCR-αβ heterodimer that recognizes the antigen as a peptide presented by the MHC , and non-covalently paired CD3γε- and δε-chains together with disulfide-linked ζ-chain homodimers. The CD3 chains play key roles in T cell development and T cell activation. In the present study , we found nor or extremely lower expression of CD3ε in head- and trunk-kidney lymphocytes by flow cytometric analysis , while CD3ε was expressed at the normal level in lymphocytes from thymus , spleen , intestine , gill , and peripheral blood. Furthermore , CD4-1
