 In rats , we recently showed how a chronic metabolic acidosis simultaneously reduced urinary oxalate excretion and promoted oxalate secretion by the distal colon leading to the proposition that acid-base disturbances may trigger changes to renal and intestinal oxalate handling. The present study sought to reproduce and extend these observations using the mouse model , where the availability of targeted gene knockouts ( KOs) would offer future opportunities to reveal some of the underlying transporters and mechanisms involved. Mice were provided with a sustained load of acid ( NH
