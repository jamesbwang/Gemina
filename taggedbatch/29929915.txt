 The innate immune system is the primary defense against cryptococcal infection , but paradoxically it promotes infection of the central nervous system. We performed a detailed longitudinal study of neurocryptococcosis in normal , chimeric , green fluorescent protein phagocyte-positive mice and phagocyte-depleted mice and interrogated the central nervous system innate immune response to Cryptococcus<pathogen> neoformans<pathogen> H99 using confocal microscopy , histology , flow cytometry , and quantification of brain cytokine/chemokines and fungal burdens. C.<pathogen> neoformans<pathogen> was present in the perivascular space ( PVS) of post-capillary venules. This was associated with a massive influx of blood-derived monocytes , neutrophils , and T lymphocytes into the PVS and a predominantly proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine response. Phagocytes containing cryptococci were present only in the lumen and corresponding PVS of post-capillary venules. Free cryptococci were observed breaching the glia limitans , the protective barrier between the PVS and the cerebral parenchyma. Parenchymal cryptococcomas were typically in direct contact with post-capillary venules and lacked surrounding immune cell infiltrates. Phagocyte depletion abrogated cryptococcoma formation and PVS infiltrates. Together , these observations suggest that cryptococcomas can originate via phagocyte-dependent transport across post-capillary venular endothelium into the PVS and thence via passage of free cryptococci into the brain. In conclusion , we demonstrate for the first time that the PVS of cortical post-capillary venules is the major site of the early innate immune response to , and phagocyte-dependent entry of , C.<pathogen> neoformans<pathogen>.
