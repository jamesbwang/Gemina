 Injection of botulinum<pathogen> neurotoxin A ( BoNT-A) according to the PREEMPT ( Phase 3 REsearch Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy) paradigm has been approved for the treatment of refractory chronic migraine in Germany in 2011. The practical application raises some questions , such as the choice of dose and injection intervals during the course of the treatment , and the appropriate time point for discontinuation of BoNT-A treatment. Taking into account the existing literature , the German Migraine and Headache Society ( Deutsche Migräne - und Kopfschmerzgesellschaft , DMKG) gives recommendations for the treatment of chronic migraine with BoNT-A. Treatment is usually started with a dose of 155 U BoNT-A. During the first year of treatment , 3‑month injection intervals are recommended. Goal of the treatment is an improvement of migraine by ≥ 30 %. If needed , dose escalation up to 195 U can be used to reach this goal. If improvement by ≥ 30 % is not reached after the third injection cycle , the treatment is usually considered to be insufficiently efficient and discontinuation is recommended. If a stable success is reached during the first year of treatment , prolongation of injection intervals to 4 months can be considered. If success continues to be stable for at least two 4‑month intervals , discontinuation of BoNT-A treatment can be tried. The literature on these points is insufficient for recommendations at the guideline level. The present recommendations are based on an expert consensus of the DMKG for the structured approach to the treatment of chronic migraine with BoNT-A.
