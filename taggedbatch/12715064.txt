 The aim of study was to evaluate the oral health status , salivary flow and halitosis among individuals diagnosed with leprosy<disease> as compared with healthy subjects. A sample of 160 individuals was allocated into four groups , as follows: ( G1) individuals with complete leprosy<disease> treatment; ( G2) individuals diagnosed with leprosy<disease> and under multi-drug therapy; ( G3) individuals diagnosed with leprosy<disease> not yet under treatment; and ( G4) healthy individuals. Then individuals were submitted to periodontal clinical examination ( visible plaque index , bleeding index , depth of probing and clinical attachment level); DMFT index ( decayed-missing-filled teeth index); evaluation of salivary flow and halitosis using a halimeter equipment ( Interscan Corp , Chatsworth , CA , USA). The data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests. The mean DMFT was found to be higher than 6.6 , which is considered very high , with no significant difference between groups ( P > 0.05). As for salivary flow , 76.2 % of the subjects presented normal flow rates , while 10 % and 13.7 % showed low and very low salivary flow rates , respectively , with hyposalivation being mostly observed in Groups 1 and 2. The highest prevalence of noticeable odor was found in healthy individuals ( G4) , and the most prevalent periodontal diagnosis was gingivitis<disease> ( 63.1 %) in Group 3 ( individuals with leprosy<disease> not yet under multi-drug therapy) followed by periodontitis<disease> ( 25 %) in Group 1 ( individuals who had completed leprosy<disease> treatment). It was observed that individuals with a history of leprosy<disease> present poor oral health similar to that of systemically healthy individuals.
