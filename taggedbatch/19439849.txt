 CHIKV is a relatively new<pathogen> virus<pathogen> and we are still learning about the illness. Very little is known about CNS its involvement and even less about its delayed or long-term manifestations if any. It therefore behoves us to consider delayed CNS involvement when assessing patients with CHIKV infections that may not have had an acute neurological manifestation at the time of diagnosis coupled with new onset neurological manifestations and MRI abnormalities. It seems likely that patients with CHIKV may experience delayed CNS manifestation of the viral<disease> infection<disease>. This report highlights the importance of a travel history when assessing patients with a neurological complaint. The pathway to best manage such cases is with repeated imaging to assess if the signal changes either progress , resolve or more importantly if there is any MRI correlation should changes in neurology develop during the surveillance period.
