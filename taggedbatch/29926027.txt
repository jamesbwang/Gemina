 Fe-Co-Ni gradient-diameter magnetic nanowire arrays were fabricated via direct-current electrodeposition into a tapered anodic aluminium oxide template. In contrast to the magnetic behaviors of uniform-diameter nanowire arrays , these arrays exhibited tailorable magnetic anisotropy that can be used to switch magnetic nanowires easily and unconventional temperature-dependent coercivity with much better thermal stability.
