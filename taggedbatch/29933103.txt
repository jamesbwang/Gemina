 Human OATP1B1 is highly expressed at the basolateral membrane of the hepatocyte. It plays an important role in the sodium-independent transport of bile acids and bile salts and contributes to the systemic clearance of many drugs. In this study , the interaction of at least one representative of all major chemical classes of bile acids and bile salts , which include the bile acid chenodeoxycholate ( CDC) , monovalent ( amidated) bile salts glycochenodeoxycholate ( GCDC) , taurochenodeoxycholate ( TCDC) and taurocholate ( TC) , a sulfated bile acid 3-sulfo-chenodeoxycholate ( 3S-CDC) and a divalent ( amidated and sulfated) bile salt 3-sulfo-glycolithocholate ( 3S-GLC) were tested with OATP1B1 overexpressed in HEK293 cells. All bile acid derivatives except for CDC showed an efficient transport by OATP1B1. 3S-GLC gave the lowest K
