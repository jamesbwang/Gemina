 Lipin-1 performs dual function during lipid metabolism , i.e. , it functions as a transcriptional coactivator and as a phosphatidate phosphatase during triglyceride biosynthesis. We investigated whether exendin-4 prevented endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress-induced hepatic steatosis and whether the protective effects of exendin-4 were associated with lipin-1 signaling. Tunicamycin and thapsigargin , ER stress inducers , increased triglycerides ( TG) content and expression of genes encoding lipid droplet surface proteins. Exendin-4 decreased the expression of ER stress markers phosphorylated PKR like ER kinase ( PERK) , phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha ( IRE1α) , and glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa ( GRP78) proteins and spliced X-box binding protein 1 ( XBP-1s) mRNA and increased the expression of genes encoding lipolytic enzymes hormone-sensitive lipase ( HSL) and monoacylglycerol lipase ( MGL) and VLDL assembly-associated proteins microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( MTP) and apolipoprotein B ( APOB) in tunicamycin-pretreated cells. Moreover , exendin-4 significantly decreased lipin-1β/ α ratio by increasing SFRP10 and increased lipin-1 nuclear localization. The decrease in lipin-1β/ α ratio was also observed in SIRT1 and AMPK agonist-treated cells. These data suggest that exendin-4 improves ER stress-induced hepatic lipid accumulation by increasing lipolysis and VLDL assembly , which is partially mediated by the regulation of lipin-1 signaling.
