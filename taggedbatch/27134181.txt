 Carbon-ion radiotherapy ( C-ion RT) provides better dose distribution in cancer treatment compared to photons. Additionally , carbon-ion beams provide a higher biological effectiveness , and thus a higher tumor control probability. However , information regarding the dose constraints for organs at risk in C-ion RT is limited. This study aimed to determine the predictive factors for late morbidities in the rectum and bladder after carbon-ion C-ion RT for uterus carcinomas. Between June 1995 and January 2010 , 134 patients with uterus carcinomas were treated with C-ion RT with curative intent; prescription doses of 52.8-74.4 Gy ( relative biological effectiveness) were delivered in 20-24 fractions. Of these patients , 132 who were followed up for > 6 months were analyzed. We separated the data in two subgroups , a 24 fractions group and a 20 fractions group. Late morbidities , proctitis<disease> , and cystitis<disease> were assessed according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria. The correlations of clinical and dosimetric parameters , V10-V60 , D In the 24 fractions group , the 3-year actuarial occurrence rates of ≥ grade 1 rectal and bladder morbidities were 64 and 9 % , respectively. In addition , in the 20 fractions group , the 3-year actuarial occurrence rates of ≥ grade 1 rectal and bladder morbidities were 32 and 19 % , respectively. Regarding the dose-volume histogram data on the rectum , the D The present study identified the dose-volume relationships in C-ion RT regarding the occurrence of late morbidities in the rectum and bladder. Assessment of the factors discussed herein would be beneficial in preventing late morbidities after C-ion RT for pelvic malignancies. Retrospectively registered ( NIRS: 16-040).
