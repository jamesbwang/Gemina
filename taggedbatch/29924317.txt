 Frailty is highly prevalent in old age and confers an important mortality risk. Although the causes of frailty are multiple , immuno-senescence ( IS)- predominantly driven by cytomegalovirus ( CMV)- has been implicated in its pathophysiology. Thus far , research examining the association between IS and frailty states is sparse and equivocal. On the other hand , evidence is mounting in support of the view that frailty can be reversed , especially for those in the pre-frail stage. Therefore , we aimed to clarify the impact of CMV on IS and its relevance to pre-frailty. 173 persons aged 80 to 99 years were enrolled. Pre-frailty was defined according to Fried 's criteria. Anti-CMV IgG and serum IL-6 were measured using Architect iSystem and Luminex , respectively. T-cell phenotypes were determined using flow cytometry. The prevalence of pre-frailty was 52.6 % , increased with age ( p = 0.001) , and was greater in men than women ( p = 0.044). No relationship was found between pre-frailty and positive CMV serology. Further , CMV-seropositivity was significantly associated with less na√Øve cells , more memory and senescence-prone phenotypes ( all p < 0.001). After adjusting for potential confounders , only IL-6 , age and sex were predictive of pre-frailty. We conclude that the presence of pre-frailty is independent from CMV infection in very old subjects.
