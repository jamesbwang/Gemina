 microRNAs ( miRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of neuronal dendrite development. Specific precursor ( pre-) miRNAs are actively transported to dendrites , but whether this process is regulated by neuronal activity and involved in activity-dependent dendritogenesis is unknown. Here we show that BDNF , a neurotrophin that is released in response to increased neuronal activity , promotes dendritic accumulation of pre-miR-134. Dendritic accumulation , but not transcription of pre-miR-134 , is abrogated by treatment of neurons with the NMDA receptor ( NMDAR) antagonist APV. Furthermore , APV interferes with BDNF-mediated repression of the known miR-134 target Pumilio<pathogen> 2 ( Pum2) in a miR-134 binding site-specific manner. At the functional level , both APV treatment and knockdown of the pre-miR-134 transport protein DHX36 antagonize BDNF-induced dendritogenesis. These effects are likely mediated by reduced dendritic miR-134 activity , since both transfection of a synthetic miR-134 duplex or of a dendritically targeted pre-miR-134-181a chimera rescues BDNF-dependent dendritogenesis in the presence of APV. In conclusion , we have identified a novel NMDAR-dependent mechanism involved in the activity-dependent control of miRNA function during neuronal development.
