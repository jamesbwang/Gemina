 The present study aimed at investigating whether associated motivational salience causes preferential processing of inherently neutral faces similar to emotional expressions by means of event-related brain potentials ( ERPs) and changes of the pupil size. To this aim , neutral faces were implicitly associated with monetary outcome , while participants ( N = 44) performed a face-matching task with masked primes that ensured performance around chance level and thus an equal proportion of gain , loss , and zero outcomes. During learning , motivational context strongly impacted the processing of the fixation , prime and mask stimuli prior to the target face , indicated by enhanced amplitudes of subsequent ERP components and increased pupil size. In a separate test session , previously associated faces as well as novel faces with emotional expressions were presented within the same task but without motivational context and performance feedback. Most importantly , previously gain-associated faces amplified the LPC , although the individually contingent face-outcome assignments were not made explicit during the learning session. Emotional expressions impacted the N170 and EPN components. Modulations of the pupil size were absent in both motivationally-associated and emotional conditions. Our findings demonstrate that neural representations of neutral stimuli can acquire increased salience via implicit learning , with an advantage for gain over loss associations.
