 Glyphosate-based herbicides ( GBHs) are the most globally used herbicides raising the risk of environmental exposition. Here , we investigated whether perinatal exposure to low doses of a GBH alters the female reproductive performance , and/or induced second-generation effects related to congenital anomalies or growth alterations. Pregnant rats ( F0) received a GBH through food , in a dose of 2 mg ( GBH-LD: GBH-low dose group) or 200 mg ( GBH-HD: GBH-high dose group) of glyphosate/kg bw/day from gestational day ( GD) 9 until weaning. Body<symptom> weight gain and vaginal canal-opening of F1 females were recorded. Sexually mature F1 females were mated to evaluate their reproductive performance by assessing the pregnancy rate , and on GD19 , the number of corpora lutea , the implantation sites ( IS) and resorption sites. To analyze second-generation effects on F2 offspring , we analyzed the fetal morphology on GD19 , and assessed the fetal length and weight , and the placental weight. GBH exposure neither altered the body<symptom> weight gain of F1 females , nor vaginal opening onset. Although all GBH-exposed F1 rats became pregnant , a lower number of IS was detected. F2 offspring from both GBH groups showed delayed growth , evidenced by lower fetal weight and length , associated with a higher incidence of small for gestational age fetuses. In addition , higher placental weight and placental index were found in F2 offspring from GBH-HD dams. Surprisingly , structural congenital anomalies ( conjoined fetuses and abnormally developed limbs) were detected in the F2 offspring from GBH-HD group. In conclusion , perinatal exposure to low doses of a GBH impaired female reproductive performance and induced fetal growth retardation and structural congenital anomalies in F2 offspring.
