 A prolonged QT interval is associated with increased risk of Torsade de Pointes and cardiovascular death. The prevalence and clinical relevance of QT prolongation in acute exacerbations of COPD ( AECOPD) , with high risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality , is currently unclear. A dual cross-sectional study strategy was therefore designed. A retrospective study evaluated 140 patients with an AECOPD requiring hospitalization , half of which had prolonged QTc on the admission ECG. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine associated factors; Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses to assess prognostic significance. A prospective study evaluated 180 pulmonary patients with acute<pathogen><disease><symptom> respiratory problems requiring hospitalization , to determine whether a prolonged QTc at admission represents an AECOPD-specific finding and to investigate the change in QTc-duration during hospitalization. Retrospectively , hypokalemia , cardiac troponin T and conductance abnormalities on ECG were significantly and independently associated with QTc prolongation. A prolonged QTc was associated with increased all-cause mortality ( HR 2.698 ( 95 % CI 1.032-7.055) , A prolonged QTc is a marker of underlying cardiovascular disease during an AECOPD. It is not COPD-specific , but a common finding during the acute phase of a pulmonary disease requiring urgent hospital admission.
