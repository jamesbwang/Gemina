 Lipoplasty , or liposuction , the surgical process of removing excess fat , is an elective procedure with rising frequency in the United States. Fat embolism syndrome<disease><symptom> is a clinical diagnosis and is defined as fat in the circulation with an identifiable clinical pattern of signs and symptoms ( eg , hypoxemia<symptom> , respiratory insufficiency , neurologic impairment , and petechial rash<symptom>) that occur in the appropriate clinical context. Fat embolism syndrome<disease><symptom> following liposuction is a life-threatening complication , although its incidence is low. Currently , there is no specific therapy for fat embolism syndrome<disease><symptom> , so prevention , early detection , and supportive therapy are critical. Many cases of fat embolism syndrome<disease><symptom> are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed; however , postmortem examination can provide the means for appropriate diagnosis. Therefore , a pathologist must keep a keen eye , as microscopic fat emboli are difficult to appreciate with routine tissue processing and staining.
