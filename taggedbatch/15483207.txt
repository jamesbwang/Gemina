 Reviews of weight<symptom> loss<symptom> mobile apps have revealed they include very few evidence-based features , relying mostly on self-monitoring. Unfortunately , adherence to self-monitoring is often low , especially among patients with motivational challenges. One behavioral strategy that is leveraged in virtually every visit of behavioral weight<symptom> loss<symptom> interventions and is specifically used to deal with adherence and motivational issues is problem solving. Problem solving has been successfully implemented in depression<symptom> mobile apps , but not yet in weight<symptom> loss<symptom> apps. This study describes the development and feasibility testing of the Habit app , which was designed to automate problem-solving therapy for weight<symptom> loss<symptom>. Two iterative single-arm pilot studies were conducted to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the Habit app. In each pilot study , adults who were overweight or obese were enrolled in an 8-week intervention that included the Habit app plus support via a private Facebook group. Feasibility outcomes included retention , app usage , usability , and acceptability. Changes in problem-solving skills and weight over 8 weeks are described , as well as app usage and weight change at 16 weeks. Results from both pilots show acceptable use of the Habit app over 8 weeks with on average two to three uses per week , the recommended rate of use. Acceptability ratings were mixed such that 54 % ( 13/24) and 73 % ( 11/15) of participants found the diet solutions helpful and 71 % ( 17/24) and 80 % ( 12/15) found setting reminders for habits helpful in pilots 1 and 2 , respectively. In both pilots , participants lost significant weight ( P = .005 and P = .03 , respectively). In neither pilot was an effect on problem-solving skills observed ( P = .62 and P = .27 , respectively). Problem-solving therapy for weight<symptom> loss<symptom> is feasible to implement in a mobile app environment; however , automated delivery may not impact problem-solving skills as has been observed previously via human delivery.
