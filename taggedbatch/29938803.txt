 While the use of recombinant antigens is being widely investigated in the diagnosis of human toxocariasis , relatively little attention has been given to animal diagnostic models. For this reason , this study aimed to investigate the diagnosis potential of Toxocara canis TES-30 and TES-120 recombinant antigens in mice , the animal model for toxocariasis studies. Serum samples obtained from mice infected with T. canis<pathogen> or Toxocara cati were tested by indirect ELISA using T. canis<pathogen> TES-30 and TES-120 recombinant antigens produced in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. 90 % of the samples reacted with rTES-30 , whereas there was almost no reactivity with rTES-120. Despite rTES-120 being a good antigen for diagnosis in humans , it could not reproduce its reactivity in this animal model. As rTES-30 has good reactivity in mice , it is a valuable tool for diagnosis.
