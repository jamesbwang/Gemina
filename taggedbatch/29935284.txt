 Data on antimicrobial use among hospitalized children in Africa are very limited due to the absence of electronic prescription tracking. This study evaluated antimicrobial consumption rates , the antimicrobial spectrum used , and the indications for therapy on a paediatric ward and in the paediatric intensive care unit ( PICU) at Tygerberg Hospital , Cape Town , South Africa. Antimicrobial prescription and patient demographic data were collected prospectively from May 10 , 2015 to November 11 , 2015. For the same period , data on antimicrobials dispensed and costs were extracted from the pharmacy electronic medicine management system. The volume of antimicrobials dispensed ( dispensing data) was compared with observed antimicrobial use ( prescription data). Of the 703 patients admitted , 415/451 ( 92 %) paediatric ward admissions and 233/252 ( 92 %) PICU admissions received â‰¥ 1 antimicrobials. On the ward , 89 % of prescriptions were for community-acquired infections; 29 % of PICU antimicrobials were prescribed for healthcare-associated infections. Ampicillin and third-generation cephalosporins were the most commonly prescribed agents. Antimicrobial costs were 67541 South African Rand ( ZAR) ( 5680 United States Dollars ( USD)) on the ward and 210484 ZAR ( 17702 USD) in the PICU. Ertapenem and meropenem were the single largest contributors to antimicrobial costs on the ward ( 43 %) and PICU ( 30 %) , respectively. The volume of antimicrobials dispensed by the pharmacy ( dispensing data) differed considerably from observed antimicrobial use ( prescription data). High rates of antimicrobial consumption were documented. Community-acquired infections were the main indication for prescription. Although pharmacy dispensing data did not closely approximate observed use , this represents a promising method for antimicrobial usage tracking in the future.
