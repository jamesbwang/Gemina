 Dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA) is a widespread nutritional `` anti-aging '' supplement. Exogenous supplementation of DHEA is now being commonly used to augment ovarian stimulation in perimenopausal women with diminished ovarian reserve. Whether DHEA causes side effects in such age is , however , unknown. Thus , this study investigates the effects of pharmacological doses of DHEA supplementation on the liver of perimenopausal rats. DHEA supplementation to perimenopausal rats resulted in slight hepatomegaly and steatosis , hepatocytic hypertrophy , mitochondrial swelling , elevation in serum alanine aminotransaminase levels , in addition to the accumulation of lipid droplets and lipolysosomes in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion , long-term administration of high doses of DHEA causes ultrastructural alterations and changes in the levels of cholesterol and triglyceride in hepatocytes of perimenopausal rats. DHEA at a dose of 50 mg/kg improves health and decreases the body<symptom> weight , with the least side effects on the liver of perimenopausal rats.
