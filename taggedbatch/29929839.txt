 Primary headache<symptom> syndromes<disease><symptom> and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> syndromes<disease><symptom> are common in patients with postural tachycardia<symptom> syndrome<disease><symptom> ( POTS). There is overlap in potential mechanisms for migraine , chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , and POTS symptomatology. Management of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> and headaches<symptom> in POTS requires a judicious use of pharmacotherapies that takes into account patient comorbidities and co-existing symptoms. Patient-centric , non-pharmacologic modalities include physical exercise , cognitive behavioral therapies , and treatment of sleep disorders.
