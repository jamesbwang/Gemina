 Mammals ( class Mammalia) have evolved diverse craniofacial morphology to adapt to a wide range of ecological niches. However , the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying the diversification of mammalian craniofacial morphology remain largely unknown. In this paper , we focus on the facial length and orofacial clefts of mammals and deduce potential mechanisms that produced diversity in mammalian facial morphology. Small-scale changes in facial morphology from the common ancestor , such as slight changes in facial length and the evolution of the midline cleft in some lineages of bats , could be attributed to heterochrony in facial bone ossification. In contrast , large-scale changes of facial morphology from the common ancestor , such as a truncated , widened face as well as the evolution of the bilateral cleft possessed by some bat species , could be brought about by changes in growth and patterning of the facial primordium ( the facial processes) at the early stages of embryogenesis.
