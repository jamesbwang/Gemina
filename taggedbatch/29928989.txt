 A risk score identifying patients at high risk for veno-occlusive disease ( VOD) may aid efforts to study preventive strategies for this uncommon complication of hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT). Patients receiving a first allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2013 as reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research ( N = 13,097) were randomly divided into training and validation sets. Independent prognostic factors for development of VOD by day +100 after HCT were identified with a multivariate logistic regression model. A risk score was constructed in the training set using the significant factors and confirmed in the validation set. Baseline characteristics of the training and validation sets were balanced. In total , 637 patients ( 4.9 %) developed VOD by day +100. Younger age , positive hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B/C serology , lower Karnofsky performance scale score , use of sirolimus , disease , disease status at transplant , and conditioning regimen were independent prognostic factors. Myeloablative conditioning regimens were associated with higher risk of VOD. Busulfan-based myeloablative conditioning regimens guided by pharmacokinetic monitoring were associated with higher risk than those without pharmacokinetic monitoring. Patients were stratified into 4 distinct , statistically significantly different groups by their risk score percentile. This pretransplant risk score successfully stratified allogeneic HCT patients by risk of developing VOD , was validated in an independent set , and demonstrated strong discriminatory ability to identify a high-risk cohort.
