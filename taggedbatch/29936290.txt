 Myxomycetes is one of the largest groups of protists belonging to Amoebozoa , with ca 1,000 species recognised and more than 4,000 names in use. Historically , myxomycetes were considered fungi<pathogen> or protozoans which , however , fell under the provisions of the former International Code of Botanical Nomenclature ( ICBN) , currently the International Code of Nomenclature for algae<pathogen> , fungi<pathogen> , and plants ( ICN). Attempts to apply the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN) to myxomycetes were rare and inconsistent; thus , we argue that Myxomycetes is not a truly ambiregnal group ( i.e. one falling under both Codes). Recently , nomenclatural novelties within Myxomycetes have been proposed using ICZN rules , and the application of zoological orthography to myxomycete higher-level taxa in the recent amoebozoan phylogenies is increasingly common. We summarise the consequences of application of either ICN or ICZN to Myxomycetes. In our opinion , nomenclatural stability within Myxomycetes is best served by strict application of ICN. Either treating myxomycetes as falling under ICZN or considering them an ambiregnal group would cause serious nomenclatural instability , mainly owing to the incompatibility of the two Codes as to the date of the starting point of nomenclature and to the appearance of numerous homonyms.
