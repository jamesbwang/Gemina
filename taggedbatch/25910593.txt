 Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital cardiac malformation. Aortic valve replacement is often required in older patients but the surgical risk is often extremely high. As Transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI) is an established therapy for intermediate and high surgical risk patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis ( AS). Advances in technology and knowledge have led to TAVI being used for other pathologies and populations such as bicuspid AS. Recently , the diagnosis and classification of bicuspid aortic valve based on multidetector computed tomography ( MDCT) assessment has been proposed , which may have an impact of outcomes after TAVI. This review article describes the advancements in diagnosis and outcomes of bicuspid AS.
