 The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor ( uPAR) , a glycoprotein localized on the cell surface with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor , plays a crucial role in cell invasion , and the metastasis of several cancers , including bladder cancer , and its expression are significantly negatively correlated with patient survival rates. Apigenin , a naturally produced phytochemical compound found in fruits , vegetables , and plant leaves , has been shown to mediate a variety of cancer-metastasis-related molecules in various cancers. The effect of apigenin on uPAR expression is still unknown. In this study , we examined the effects of apigenin on IL-1β-induced uPAR expression and investigated its potential mechanisms. We discovered in this study that IL-1β could remarkably induce uPAR expression in bladder cancer T24 cells and that apigenin-inhibited IL-1β could induce uPAR expression concentration-dependently. Interestingly , NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors were critically required for IL-1β-induced high uPAR expression. Apigenin suppressed the transcriptional activity of both AP-1 and NF-κB by inhibiting ERK1/2 and JNK signaling pathways. These results suggest that apigenin can exert anti-invasion effects by inhibiting uPAR expression via mediating ( ERK1/2 , JNK)/ AP-1 and ( ERK1/2 , JNK)/ NF-κB signaling pathways in human T24 cells. Our present study generated novel and valuable biological insight into anti-invasion through treatment with a small native compound.
