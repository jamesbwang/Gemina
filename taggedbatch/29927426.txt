 The article describes a rare clinical case of a patient with previously undiagnosed von Willebrand disease and basal meningioma; an intracranial neurosurgical intervention was complicated by delayed intracranial hematomas , both at the resected tumor site and distantly. The diagnosis of von Willebrand disease was established only after special hematology tests and only after surgery. Despite the use of specific therapy , the patient died due to intracranial hemorrhagic complications in the postoperative period. The paper discusses the problem of preoperative diagnosis of asymptomatic hemostasis disorders in neurosurgical patients and potential ways of its solution.
