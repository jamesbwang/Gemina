 The utility of fine-needle aspiration cytology ( FNAC) in parotid<symptom> tumours remains widely debated. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of FNAC in diagnosing parotid tumours. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with tumour disease of the parotid<symptom> gland treated at a Portuguese Oncology Institute , over a period of 25 years. The preoperative FNAC results were compared with the final histopathological diagnosis. We calculated the sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( PPV) and negative predictive value ( NPV) of FNAC for malignancy. Association between malignancy on histopathology and FNAC results were evaluated with the Chi-square test. The study sample consisted of 155 patients ( 77 males and 78 females) with a mean age of 56.6 Â± 17.0 years. In 27 cases ( 17.4 %) , the FNAC result was indeterminate. In this group of patients there was a higher proportion of malignancy on histology ( 48.1 %) ( X A benign result on FNAC should be used with caution , due to its low sensitivity for malignancy. An indeterminate result on FNAC should raise suspicion for a malignant tumour.
