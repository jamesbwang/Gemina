 We have designed and synthesized novel hollow Ni/Fe layered double hydroxide ( LDH) polyhedrons as an advanced sulfur host for enhancing the performance of lithium-sulfur ( Li-S) batteries. The Ni/Fe LDH host shows multiple advantages. First , the Ni/Fe LDH shells can provide sufficient sulfiphilic sites for chemically bonding with polysulfides. Second , the hollow architecture can provide sufficient inner space for both loading a large amount of sulfur and accommodating its large volumetric expansion. Moreover , once the active material is confined within the host , the shells could easily restrict the outward diffusion of polysulfides , guaranteeing prolonged cycle life even with high sulfur loading. As a result , the S@Ni/ Fe LDH cathode has successfully solved the main issues related to sulfur electrodes , and it exhibits significantly improved electrochemical performances with prolonged life over 1000 cycles and excellent rate properties.
