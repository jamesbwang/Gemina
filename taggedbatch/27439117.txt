 Enterovirus<pathogen> A71<pathogen> ( EV-A71) is an important nonpolio enterovirus<pathogen> that causes severe<symptom> neurological complications. In 1998 , Taiwan experienced an EV-A71 outbreak that caused 78 deaths. Since then , periodic epidemics of EV-A71 associated with newly emerging strains have occurred. Several of these strains are known to be recombinant; however , how these strains arose within such a short period of time remains unknown. Here , we sequenced 64 full-length genomes from clinical isolates collected from 2005 to 2016 and incorporated all 91 Taiwanese genomes downloaded from the Virus Pathogen Resource to extensively analyze EV-A71 recombination in Taiwan. We found that the B3 subgenotype was a potential recombinant parent of the EV-A71 C2-like and C4 strains by intratypic recombination. Such B3-similar regions were also found in many cocirculating coxsackieviruses belonging to Enterovirus<pathogen> A<pathogen> species ( EV-A) through a series of intertypic recombinations. Therefore , locally enriched outbreaks of cocirculating viruses from different genotypes/serotypes may facilitate recombination. Most recombination breakpoints we found had nonrandom distributions and were located within the region spanning from the boundary of P1 ( structural gene) and P2 ( nonstructural) to the cis-acting replication element at P2 , indicating that specific genome reassembly of structural and nonstructural genes may be subject to natural selection. Through intensive recombination , 11 EV-A71-like signatures ( including one in 3A , two in 3C , and eight in 3D) were found to be present in a variety of recently cocirculating EV-A viruses worldwide , suggesting that these viruses may be targets for wide-spectrum antiviral development.
