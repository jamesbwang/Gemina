 A better understanding of the factors that affect self-perception of body characteristics may play an important role in weight control practices. The objective of this study was to analyze body<symptom> weight perception and body image satisfaction in low-income adult women in Southern Brazil. This was a cross-sectional survey study in a cohort of women recruited from areas of social vulnerability in the city of Porto Alegre , RS. A random sample ( n = 218) of women was interviewed , and socioeconomic and lifestyle factors , body image perception using the Stunkard Scale , body<symptom> weight estimation , weight concern and duplicate anthropometric measurements were obtained. The average age of the low-income women was 56.3 Â± 9.5 years. The prevalences of overweight and obese individuals were 34.1 % and 52.5 % , respectively. Among all women , 83.0 % were dissatisfied with their body image , and 68.9 % of the women estimated their body<symptom> weight correctly. In addition to BMI ( body mass index) , the proportions of women with a higher income ( p = 0.05) , smoking history ( p < 0.01) and history of hypertension ( p = 0.04) were significantly different between groups according to body image satisfaction. Multivariate analyses using Poisson regression showed that black/mixed race , higher income , and underweight and obese women were more likely to be dissatisfied with their body image. The majority of women know their body<symptom> weight and have body image dissatisfaction. Skin<symptom> color , higher income and BMI were significantly associated with dissatisfaction. In addition , these women consider the `` healthiest '' body image to be thinner than the `` ideal '' body image , and the `` ideal '' image is one of normal weight and not too thin.
