 Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in China and worldwide. Increasing numbers of studies have demonstrated that microRNAs ( miRNAs/miRs) have vital functions in numerous developmental processes and tumorigenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate miR-154 expression in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) , and to explore the roles of miR-154 in the carcinogenesis and progression of this cancer. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR) was performed to detect miR-154 expression in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. In addition , cell proliferation assay , migration and invasion assays were adopted to investigate the functional roles of miR-154 in NSCLC. Bioinformatics analysis , luciferase reporter assay , RT-qPCR and western blot analysis were used to explore the potential targets of miR-154 in NSCLC. According to the results , miR-154 was significantly downregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Restoration of miR-154 expression inhibited proliferation , migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. In addition , B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia<disease> virus insertion site 1 ( BMI-1) was identified as a direct target gene of miR-154 in NSCLC. In conclusion , miR-154 may function as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC , partly by regulating BMI-1 , and the modulation of miR-154 expression represents a potential strategy for the treatment of NSCLC patients.
