 Fibroblast growth factor ( FGF) belongs to a large family of growth factors. FGFs use paracrine or endocrine signaling to mediate a myriad of biological and pathophysiological process , including angiogenesis , wound<disease><symptom> healing , embryonic development , and metabolism regulation. FGF drugs for the treatment of burn and ulcer<disease><symptom> wounds<disease><symptom> are now available. The recent discovery of the crucial roles of the endocrine-acting FGF19 subfamily in maintaining homeostasis of bile acid , glucose , and phosphate further extended the activity profile of this family. Here , the applications of recombinant FGFs for the treatment of wounds<disease><symptom> , diabetes , hypophosphatemia , the development of FGF receptor inhibitors as anti-neoplastic drugs , and the achievements of basic research and applications of FGFs in China are reviewed.
