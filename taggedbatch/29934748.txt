 Division of attention ( DA) at the time of learning has large detrimental effects on subsequent memory performance , but DA at retrieval has much smaller effects ( Baddeley , Lewis , Eldridge , & Thomson , 1984 , Journal of Experimental Psychology: General , 113 , 518-540; Craik , Govoni , Naveh-Benjamin , & Anderson , 1996 , Journal of Experimental Psychology: General , 125 , 159-180). Experiment 1 confirmed the relatively small effects of DA on retrieval and also showed that retrieval operations do consume processing resources. The experiment also found that the effect is not attributable to a trade-off in performance with the concurrent task or to recognition decisions made on the basis of familiarity judgments. Participants made levels-of-processing ( LOP) judgments during encoding to check whether deeper semantic judgments were differentially vulnerable to the effects of DA. In fact DA did not interact with LOP. Experiment 2 explored reports that the comparatively slight effect of DA on recognition accuracy is accompanied by a compensatory increase in recognition latency ( Baddeley et al. , 1984). The experiment replicated findings that neither DA nor differential emphasis between recognition and a concurrent continuous reaction time ( CRT) task affected recognition accuracy , but also found evidence for a lawful trade-off in decision latencies between recognition and CRT performance. Further analysis showed that the relationship between response rates on the two tasks was well described by a linear function , and that this function was demonstrated by the majority of individual participants. It is concluded that the small effect of DA on recognition performance is attributable to a trade-off within the recognition task itself; accuracy is maintained by a compensatory increase in decision latency.
