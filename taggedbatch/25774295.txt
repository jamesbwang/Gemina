 Infectious<disease> mononucleosis<disease> is a common disease of the adolescent caused by the Epstein-Barr<disease> virus ( EBV). We present a rare case of a male adult<disease> with acalculous cholecystitis<disease> due to infectious<disease> mononucleosis<disease>. A correct diagnosis was challenging due to a false negative antibody test. Laboratory values were significant for a marked lymphocytosis and an early Immunoglobulin G ( IgG) response without initial Immunoglobulin M ( IgM) elevation. However , IgM antibodies were elevated two weeks later. Symptoms resolved quickly under symptomatic therapy. Antibody level patterns in asplenic patients with infectious<disease> mononucleosis<disease> are characterized by an atypical course with a delayed rise in IgM antibodies , which complicates the correct diagnosis of an EBV-induced acalculous cholecystitis<disease>.
