 Crown ethers have been known for over 50 years , but no example of a complex between a noble-gas compound and a crown ether or another polydentate ligand had been reported. Xenon trioxide is shown to react with 15-crown-5 to form the kinetically stable ( CH ₂ CH ₂ O) ₅ XeO ₃ adduct which , in marked contrast with solid XeO ₃ , does not detonate when mechanically shocked. The crystal structure shows that the five oxygen atoms of the crown ether are coordinated to the xenon atom of XeO ₃. The gas-phase Wiberg bond valences and indices and empirical bond valences indicate the Xe-- O ( crown) bonds are predominantly electrostatic and are consistent with σ-hole bonding. Mappings of the electrostatic potential ( EP) onto the Hirshfeld surfaces of XeO ₃ and 15-crown-5 in ( CH ₂ CH ₂ O) ₅ XeO ₃ and a detailed examination of the molecular electrostatic potential surface ( MEPS) of XeO ₃ and ( CH ₂ CH ₂ O) ₅ reveal regions of negative EP on the oxygen atoms of ( CH ₂ CH ₂ O) ₅ and regions of high positive EP on the xenon atom that are also in accordance with σ-hole interactions.
