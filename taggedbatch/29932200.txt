 Two-photon photodynamic therapy ( TP-PDT) is a very promising treatment that has drawn much attention in recent years due to its ability to penetrate deeper into tissues and minimize the damage to normal cells. Here , the properties of three highly water soluble Ru ( ii) and Zn ( ii) polypyridyl complexes as photosensitizers ( PSs) were examined , including the one-photon and two-photon absorption ( OPA and TPA) spectra , singlet-triplet energy gap ( Î”H-L) , TPA cross-section and spin-orbit coupling constant via Density Function Theory ( DFT) and Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory ( TD-DFT). Their potential therapeutic use as photosensitizers in TP-PDT is proposed , where the reasoning is as follows: first , they possess strong absorption in the therapeutic window; second , the vertical excitation energy is greater than 0.98 eV , which can generate a singlet oxygen species and the remarkable coupling between the S1 and T1 states. Moreover , the spin-orbit matrix elements are greater than 0.24 cm-1 for Ru-bpy and Zn-tpy , indicating that the intersystem spin crossing processes are efficient. It is expected that these complexes will be applied to PSs in TP-PDT , and we hope this research can serve as a guideline for the development of efficient two-photon PSs.
