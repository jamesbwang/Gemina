 To estimate the cumulative live birth rates ( CLBRs) in women with poor ovarian response ( POR) diagnosed according to the Bologna criteria. A 15-year population-based observational cohort study. Teaching hospital. Between 2002 and 2016 a total of 3,391 women with POR were followed from their first fresh , nondonor IVF cycle until they had a live birth or discontinued treatment. All IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI) cycles and cryocycles were included. None. Live birth rates per initiated cycle , the conservative and optimistic CLBR for multiple IVF cycles. The CLBRs after six IVF cycles were 14.9 % for the conservative and 35.3 % for the optimistic estimate. The CLBR decreased from 22 % for women ≤ 30 years to 18.3 % for women aged 31-34 years , 17.2 % for 35-37 years , 13.5 % for 38-40 years , 10.5 % for 41-43 years , and 4.4 % among women > 43 years in the conservative analysis. There was a significant decreased CLBR starting at age 38 years compared with women < 35 years. After adjusting for age , antral follicle count , basal FSH level , and IVF cycle number , natural cycles were associated with the lowest CLBR among all the protocols , and this difference was significant compared with the other protocols. For women with POR , the CLBR declined with increasing age. Women with advanced age ( ≥ 38 years) achieved a significantly lower CLBR than young poor responders ( < 35 years). Very low CLBR was associated with women aged > 43 years old. Natural cycle IVF is of no benefit for these patients.
