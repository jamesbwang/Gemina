 Nasopharyngeal adenocarcinomas are rare tumours , and include neoplasms arising from the nasopharyngeal surface epithelium as well as those of minor salivary gland origin , each of which is distinct from the other. The former encompasses nasopharyngeal papillary adenocarcinoma ( NPAC) , also known as low grade NPAC and thyroid-like NPAC , an extremely unusual malignancy bearing histomorphological similarity to papillary thyroid carcinoma , and displaying indolent clinical behaviour. We report the case of a 41-year-old lady who developed NPAC as a second malignancy five-and-a-half years after being diagnosed and treated for a diffuse astrocytoma in the frontal lobe. In addition , we discuss the differential diagnosis , as well as raise certain pathogenetic considerations with regard to this unique neoplasm.
