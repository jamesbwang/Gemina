 The observation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( PMA) at MgO/Fe interfaces boosted the development of spintronic devices based on ultrathin ferromagnetic layers. Yet , magnetization reversal in the standard magnetic tunnel junctions ( MTJs) with competing PMA and in-plane anisotropies remains unclear. Here we report on the field induced nonvolatile broken symmetry magnetization reorientation transition from the in-plane to the perpendicular ( out of plane) state at temperatures below 50 K. The samples were 10 nm thick Fe in MgO/Fe ( 100)/ MgO as stacking components of V/MgO/Fe/ MgO/Fe/Co double barrier MTJs with an area of 20 × 20 μm
