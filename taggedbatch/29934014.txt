 To investigate the association between endometriosis and preeclampsia and/or its severe forms ( eclampsia and/or the hemolysis<symptom> , elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count ( HELLP) syndrome<pathogen><disease><symptom>) in pregnancies conceived either spontaneously or by assisted reproductive technology ( ART). Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. Search in PubMed-Medline , Scopus , Web of Science , Cochrane Library , Clinicaltrials.gov , the UK Clinical Trials Gateway , and the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry was conducted from inception through 21 June 2017 , without language restrictions. Primary outcome was preeclampsia and/or its severe forms ( eclampsia and/or HELLP syndrome<disease><symptom>) in pregnant women. Random-effects models were used for meta-analyses. Endometriosis effect was estimated as odds ratio ( OR) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI). A total of 9 cohort and 4 case-control studies were eligible for data analysis , including 39,816 pregnancies with endometriosis and 2,831,065 without. Women with endometriosis diagnosed through biopsy did not have a higher preeclampsia , eclampsia and HELLP syndrome<disease><symptom> risk as compared to those without ( OR 1.01 , 95 % CI 0.56-1.82); this was found the same even if endometriosis was diagnosed using other procedures ( OR 1.15 , 95 % CI 0.94-1.40). Preeclampsia , eclampsia and HELLP syndrome<disease><symptom> risk was also not increased in women with endometriosis conceiving spontaneously ( OR 1.21; 95 % CI 0.94-1.56) or through ART ( OR 0.74; 95 % CI 0.41-1.35). This meta-analysis evidences that endometriosis was not associated to a higher risk of preeclampsia and/or its severe forms in pregnancies either conceived spontaneously or through ART.
