 Nanotechnology is emerging as a promising tool to perform noninvasive therapy and optical imaging. However , nanomedicine may pose a potential risk of toxicity during in vivo applications. In this study , we aimed to investigate the potential toxicity of rare-earth nanoparticles ( RENPs) using mice as models. We synthesized RENPs through a typical co-precipitation method. Institute of Cancer Research ( ICR) mice were randomly divided into seven groups including a control group and six experimental groups ( 10 mice per group). ICR mice were intravenously injected with bare RENPs at a daily dose of 0 , 0.5 , 1.0 , and 1.5 mg/kg for 7 days. To evaluate the toxicity of these nanoparticles in mice , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) was performed to assess their uptake in mice. In addition , hematological and biochemical analyses were conducted to evaluate any impairment in the organ functions of ICR mice. The analysis of variance ( ANOVA) followed by a one-way ANOVA test was used in this study. A repeated measures ' analysis was used to determine any significant differences in white blood cell ( WBC) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) , and creatinine ( CREA) levels at different evaluation times in each group. We demonstrated the successful synthesis of two different sizes ( 10 nm and 100 nm) of RENPs. Their physical properties were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and a 980 nm laser diode. Results of MRI study revealed the distribution and circulation of the RENPs in the liver. In addition , the hematological analysis found an increase of WBCs to ( 8.69 ± 0.85) × 10 The use of bare RENPs may cause possible hepatotoxicity and nephritictoxicity in mice.
