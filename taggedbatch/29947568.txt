 To assess the impact of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP) 1-1607 1G/2G ( rs1799750) , MMP7-181 A/G ( rs11568818) single-nucleotide polymorphism and systemic cytokins interleukin-1 beta ( IL-1β) , IL-6 levels on the development of exudative age-related macular degeneration ( eAMD) Methodology: The study group comprised 282 patients with eAMD , and the control group enrolled 379 randomly selected persons. The genotyping of MMP1-1607 ( rs1799750) and MMP7-181 ( rs11568818) was performed by using the polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism method. To determine IL-1β and IL-6 serum levels , the immunoenzymatic method with monoclonal antibodies coated plates was performed. MMP1 rs1799750 1G/2G genotype was more frequently found in the development of eAMD. It was associated with a 4.3-fold increased risk for eAMD under the codominant model and a 4.9-fold increased risk for eAMD under the overdominant model. The effect was more pronounced at the age of less than 65 years. IL-1β concentration was significantly higher for MMP1 rs1799750 1G/1G genotype and MMP7 rs11568818 A/G genotype in eAMD patients compared with control group subjects. MMP1 rs1799750 1G/2G genotype was found to play a significant role in the development of eAMD at the age of less than 65 years. IL-1β concentration was significantly higher in eAMD patients for MMP1 rs1799750 1G/1G genotype and MMP7 rs11568818 A/G genotype compared with control group subjects.
