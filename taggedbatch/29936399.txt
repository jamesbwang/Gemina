 This work aims at creating 3D freehand ultrasound reconstructions from 2D probes with image-based tracking , therefore not requiring expensive or cumbersome external tracking hardware. Existing model-based approaches such as speckle decorrelation only partially capture the underlying complexity of ultrasound image formation , thus producing reconstruction accuracies incompatible with current clinical requirements. Here , we introduce an alternative approach that relies on a statistical analysis rather than physical models , and use a convolutional neural network ( CNN) to directly estimate the motion of successive ultrasound frames in an end-to-end fashion. We demonstrate how this technique is related to prior approaches , and derive how to further improve its predictive capabilities by incorporating additional information such as data from inertial measurement units ( IMU). This novel method is thoroughly evaluated and analyzed on a dataset of 800 in vivo ultrasound sweeps , yielding unprecedentedly accurate reconstructions with a median normalized drift of 5.2 %. Even on long sweeps exceeding 20 cm with complex trajectories , this allows to obtain length measurements with median errors of 3.4 % , hence paving the way toward translation into clinical routine.
