 The complicated synthesis procedure and the unstable nature of 1T MoS2 vastly impede its practical application although it has shown a high performance for many different applications. Herein , we have synthesized ultrastable 1T phase MoS2 embedded in CoOOH by a facile one-pot strategy and achieved a high overall water splitting activity. The amorphous CoOOH in this heterostructure not only exhibits high oxygen evolution reaction activity , but also anchors and stabilizes the 1T MoS2 as vertically aligned single layers. This novel method gives new insight into developing stable and active atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures.
