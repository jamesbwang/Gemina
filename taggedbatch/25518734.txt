 This study aimed to compare the performance of chemiluminescence immunoassay ( CLIA) , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) , and passive agglutination ( PA) method in detecting This study enrolled a total of 280 patients who were consecutively seen at the Nanfang Hospital of the Southern Medical University in Guangdong Province , China , between August and December 2016. Serum was collected and examined by CLIA , ELISA , and PA , respectively. There were 180 positive ( 64.3 %) and 100 negative cases ( 35.7 %) by PA , 184 positive ( 65.7 %) and 96 negative cases ( 34.3 %) by CLIA MP-immunoglobulin ( Ig) M , 89 positive ( 31.8 %) and 191 negative cases ( 68.2 %) by CLIA MP-IgG , 196 positive ( 70 %) and 84 negative cases ( 30 %) by ELISA MP-IgM , and 114 positive ( 40.7 %) and 166 negative cases ( 59.3 %) by ELISA MP-IgG. Patients were allocated to two groups based on PA results. In PA-negative group ( ≤ 1:40) , the positive rates of MP-IgM by CLIA were 22.8 % and 51.2 % and by ELISA were 33.3 % and 53.5 % , respectively. In the PA-positive group ( 1:80 to ≥ 1:1,280) , MP-IgM negative cases showed a decreasing trend: 40 % , 18 % , 14.3 % , 10 % , and 6.7 % ( CLIA) , and 43.3 % , 8 % , 14.3 % , 5 % , and 6.7 % ( ELISA). The consistency between CLIA/ELISA MP-IgM ,- IgG , and- IgG + MP-IgM was > 92 % for negative cases and > 75 % for positive cases , resulting in an overall consistency rate > 88 %. The kappa coefficients were 0.804 , 0.763 , and 0.806 , respectively. CLIA and ELISA have a higher sensitivity compared with PA.. CLIA has a high concordance with ELISA. Moreover , CLIA has a higher specificity and sensitivity for the detection of IgM and IgG and should be used for the clinical diagnosis of MP infection.
