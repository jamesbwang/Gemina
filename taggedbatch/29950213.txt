 To explore the possible mechanism underlaying interference of epihopin on the proliferation of AML KG-1a cells by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway , so as to prvide the experimental basis for development of drug to treat the AML. A total of 50 c57BL/6 mice were randomy divided into 5 group: blank control , model control , high , medium and low dose of epihopin. Except the blank control group , the KG-1a cells were injected in abdominal cavity of 4 groups for the establishment of model. The mice in high , middle and low dose groups were injected intramuscularly with 80 , 40 and 20 mg/kg of epihopin respectively , while the mice in blank control and model control group were injected intramuscularly with saline. The Western blot was used to detect the expression of S phase kinase-related protein 2 ( SKP-2) , β-catenin , E-cadherin and poly- ( ADP ribose) polymerase ( PARP); the spectrophotometry was used to detect the activity of caspase 3 and procaspase-3 , the flow cytometry was used to detect the cell cycle distribution and the apoptotic rate of KG-1a cells treated with epihopin. The epihopin could enhance the activity of caspase 3 , decrease the level of procaspase 3; also could up-regulate the expression of E-acadherin and down-regulate the expression of SKP-2 and β-catenin; and could increase the expression of PARP in dose-dependent manner. After KG-1a cels were treated with epihopin , the apoptosis rate of cells significantly increased , the KG-1a cells were arrested in G The epihopin can dose-dependently split PARP to induce the apoptosis of KG-1a cells , its mechanism may relate with inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and its down-stream-related gene expression.
