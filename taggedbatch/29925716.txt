 For treatment of severe bimaxillary protrusion in adults , a condition known to be among the most difficult to manage , both the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth must be fully retracted using all the extraction space available. This article reports the treatment of an adult with severe high-angle bimaxillary protrusion. To correct the protrusion of the anterior teeth , orthodontic anchor screws ( OASs) were used to provide absolute anchorage during anterior retraction. Acceptable occlusion , facial profile , and balance<symptom> were achieved. OASs appear to be very useful for treatment of severe bimaxillary protrusion in adults.
