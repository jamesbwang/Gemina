 Recent progress in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology enables the use of microorganisms for the production of chemicals- `` bio-based chemicals. '' However , it is still unclear which chemicals have the highest economic prospect. To this end , we develop a framework for the identification of such promising ones. Specifically , we first develop a genome-scale constraint-based metabolic modeling approach , which is used to identify a candidate pool of 209 chemicals ( together with the estimated yield , productivity , and residence time for each) from the intersection of the high-production-volume chemicals and the KEGG and MetaCyc databases. Second , we design three screening criteria based on a chemical 's profit margin , market volume , and market size. The total process cost , including the downstream separation cost , is systematically incorporated into the evaluation. Third , given the three aforementioned criteria , we identify 32 products as economically promising if the maximum yields can be achieved , and 22 products if the maximum productivities can be achieved. The breakeven titer that renders zero profit margin for each product is also presented. Comparisons between extracellular and intracellular production , as well as Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> systems are also discussed. The proposed framework provides important guidance for future studies in the production of bio-based chemicals. It is also flexible in that the databases , yield estimations , and criteria can be modified to customize the screening.
