 In this study , we investigated whether ZnO coating on Ag nanoparticles ( NPs) tunes electron flux and hole figuration at the metal-semiconductor interface under UV radiation. This effect triggers the photoactivity and generation of reactive oxygen species from Ag@ZnO NPs , which results in enhanced cytotoxic effects and apoptotic cell death in human breast cancer cells ( MDA-MB231). In this context , upregulation of apoptotic cascade proteins ( i.e. , Bax/Bcl2 association , p53 , cytochrome c , and caspase-3) along with activation of oxidative stress proteins suggested the occurrence of apoptosis by Ag@ZnO NPs in cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway. Also , preincubation of breast cancer cells with Ag@ZnO NPs in dark conditions muted NP-related toxic effects and consequent apoptotic fate , highlighting biocompatible properties of unexcited Ag@ZnO NPs. Furthermore , the diagnostic efficacy of Ag@ZnO NPs as computed tomography ( CT)/ optical nanoprobes was investigated. Results confirmed the efficacy of the photoactivated system in obtaining desirable outcomes from CT/optical imaging , which represents novel theranostic NPs for simultaneous imaging and treatment of cancer.
