 Chickens are considered potential reservoirs for human extraintestinal infections with pathogenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. However , information about genetic relatedness between E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> from healthy chickens and human patients is still limited. In this study , clinical samples from patients with extraintestinal infections and healthy broiler chickens were collected from geographically related locations in Egypt during the 2nd half of 2015. The recovered isolates were tested for susceptibility against β-lactam antimicrobials and screened for the presence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases ( ESBLs) and virulence genes; clonal and phylotypes were also determined. Forty-eight percent ( 48/100) and 31.3 % ( 50/160) of human and chicken samples were positive for E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , respectively. Although only 4 % ( 2/50) of the chicken isolates were resistant to the tested β-lactams , over 58 % of human E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates ( 28/48) exhibited resistance to cefotaxime. For β-lactamases , 52.1 % , 33.3 % , 20.8 % , and 6.25 % of human E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> were positive for bla The above findings suggest that although no single clone appeared to be circulating among E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates from human and chicken , some shared characteristics exist among isolates from both sources. Increased study will aid to track the dissemination of β-lactam-resistant E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> from healthy chickens to humans for implementation of effective intervention strategies.
