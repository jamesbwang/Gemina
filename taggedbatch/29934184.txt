 Guaraná ( Paullinia cupana) is a typical product from Amazon biota that exerts antioxidant capacity due to the presence of phenolic compounds , such as catechin , epicatechin and proanthocyanidins. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential inhibitory activity of guaraná extracts , after digestion in vitro , on carbohydrates-metabolism enzymes and to assess the bioacessibility of guaraná polyphenols. The guaraná samples before and after enzymatic digestion , were compared for total phenolic content and phenolic profile. Furthermore , we investigated the uptake of polyphenols from guarana , using Caco-2 cells , and the effect of digested guaraná on carbohydrate metabolism enzymes. The amount of total phenolic compounds extracted from guaraná decreased after digestion in vitro , and native phenolics were not identified after cell permeation. On the other hand , polyphenols from guaraná were able to inhibit α-glucosidase and α-amylase activities. In conclusion , guaraná can be considered as a dietary source with anti-hyperglycemic potential.
