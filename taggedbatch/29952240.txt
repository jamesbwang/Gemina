 We evaluated a Staphylococcus<pathogen> argenteus-specific diagnostic profile of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer for accurate identification of this novel bacterium<pathogen>. Staphylococcus<pathogen> argenteus was identified based on negative crtM gene and presence of specific sequence types. A classification model was generated by cluster analysis of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer results and ClinProTools software for 25 S. argenteus and 25 methicillin-susceptible S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MSSA). The performance of the classification model was validated against 72 S. argenteus and 72 MSSA isolates. With cluster analysis and classification model , differentiation of 72 S. argenteus from 72 MSSA had 100.0 % accuracy by chemical extraction method and 87.5 % sensitivity and 100.0 % specificity by direct smear method. The classification model could accurately differentiate S. argenteus from MSSA.
