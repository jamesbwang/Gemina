 Hypoglossal nerve stimulation is a promising new treatment for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. In the initial Stimulation Therapy for Apnea Reduction Trial , the overall rate of serious adverse events was < 2 % and no cases of pneumothorax were reported. We present the case of an iatrogenic pneumothorax during placement of the chest sensor lead between the intercostal muscles. Following clinical and radiological evaluation , surgery was continued and the patient was treated expectantly. In the following review , we discuss pathophysiology , diagnosis , and expected outcomes. Surgeons placing hypoglossal nerve stimulators should be aware of complications and prepared to manage a pneumothorax.
