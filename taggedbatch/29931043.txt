 Proteins , especially those involved in signaling pathways are composed of functional modules connected by linker domains with varying degrees of flexibility. To understand the structure-function relationships in these macromolecules , it is helpful to visualize the geometric arrangement of domains. Furthermore , accurate spatial representation of domain structure is necessary for coarse-grain models of the multi-molecular interactions that comprise signaling pathways. We introduce a new tool , mol2sphere , that transforms the atomistic structure of a macromolecule into a series of linked spheres corresponding to domains. It does this with a k-means clustering algorithm. It may be used for visualization or for coarse grain modeling and simulation.
