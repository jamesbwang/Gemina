 We investigated the quality system performance in Rwandan referral laboratories to determine their progress toward accreditation. We conducted audits across five laboratories in 2017 , using the Stepwise Laboratory Quality Improvement Process Towards Accreditation checklist. Laboratories were scored based on the World Health Organization grading scale ( 0-5 stars scale) and compared with earlier audits. Between 2012 and 2017 , only one laboratory progressed ( from four to five stars). Four of the five laboratories decreased to one ( three laboratories) and zero ( one laboratory) stars from four and three stars. Management reviews , evaluation , audits , documents , records , and identification of nonconformities showed a low performance. Four of five laboratories are not moving toward accreditation. However , this target is still achievable by energizing responsibilities of stakeholders and monitoring and evaluation. This would be possible because of the ability that laboratories showed in earlier audits , coupled with existing health policy that enables sustainable quality health care in Rwanda.
