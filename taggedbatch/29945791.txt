 Alpha ( 8-14 Hz) oscillatory power is linked to cortical excitability and corresponding modulations of sensory evoked potentials and perceptual detection performance. In somatosensory cortex ( S1) , negative linear and inverted U-shape relationships exist , whereas its effect on the primary motor cortex ( M1) is hardly known. We used real-time EEG-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS) of M1 to characterize the relationship between spontaneous sensorimotor mu-alpha power fluctuations at rest and corticospinal excitability. In 16 subjects , mu-alpha power was continuously monitored over the left sensorimotor cortex , and each 10 %- percentile bin of the individual mu-alpha power distribution was repeatedly targeted in pseudorandomized order by single-pulse TMS of left M1 , measuring motor evoked potentials ( MEP) in the contralateral hand. We found a weak positive relationship between mu-alpha power and MEP amplitude. Sensorimotor mu-alpha power may reflect a net facilitation or disinhibition of M1 , possibly resulting from mu-alpha based suppression of excitatory and inhibitory input from S1.
