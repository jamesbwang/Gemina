 To evaluate the renoprotective roles of dapagliflozin in prediabetic rats in order to elucidate the effects of this sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 ( SGLT2) inhibitor on the renal complications associated with metabolic dysfunction in diet-induced obesity. Obesity was induced by feeding a high-fat diet ( HFD) to male Wistar rats for 16 weeks. HFD-fed rats were treated with dapagliflozin ( 1 mg/kg/d) or metformin ( 30 mg/kg/d) by oral gavage for 4 weeks after insulin resistance had been established. The metabolic characteristics and renal function associated with lipid accumulation , inflammation<symptom> , fibrosis<disease> , endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress and apoptosis in the renal tissue were examined. The results showed that HFD-fed rats developed both obesity and impaired renal function , along with increased renal triglyceride accumulation. Importantly , dapagliflozin had greater efficacy in improving renal function and reducing both body<symptom> weight and visceral fat accumulation than metformin treatment. Dapagliflozin and metformin were found to have similar effects regarding the suppression of renal triglycerides , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) expression and malondialdehyde ( MDA) levels , subsequently leading to a decrease in renal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> and fibrosis<disease>. Renal ER stress and apoptosis were increased in HFD-fed rats and were effectively reduced after administration of dapagliflozin. The expression of renal SGLT2 was not affected by administration of dapagliflozin or metformin. Collectively , these findings indicate that dapagliflozin exerts renoprotective effects by alleviating obesity-induced renal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> , fibrosis<disease> , ER stress , apoptosis and lipid accumulation in the prediabetic condition.
