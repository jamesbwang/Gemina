 Objective To evaluate how isoflurane affects T-cell function by assaying interleukin ( IL) -2 production and the expression of two Casitas B-lineage lymphoma ( Cbl) family proto-oncogenes ( c-Cbl and Cbl-b) in rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs). Methods Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to those that underwent blood collection after brief isoflurane anesthesia ( control group) , immediately after 4 hours of isoflurane general anesthesia ( 4I group) , and 1 day after 4 hours of isoflurane general anesthesia ( 1D 4I group). IL-1 , IL-2 , and IL-6 mRNA levels and c-Cbl and Cbl-b levels in PBMCs were determined by polymerase chain reaction. Ubiquitination of protein kinase Cθ ( PKCθ) and phospholipase C-γ1 ( PLC-γ1) in PBMCs was assessed by immunoprecipitation. Results The IL-2 mRNA level in rat PBMCs was significantly lower in the 4I and 1D 4I groups than in the control group. c-Cbl , Cbl-b , and ubiquitin expression was significantly increased and zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 , PLC-γ1 , and PKCθ protein levels were significantly decreased in the 4I group. Ubiquitination of PLC-γ1 and PKCθ was significantly increased in the 4I group. Conclusion Isoflurane influences ubiquitin , c-Cbl , and Cbl-b expression in rat PBMCs , indicating suppression of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. These results suggest that isoflurane suppresses T-cell function.
