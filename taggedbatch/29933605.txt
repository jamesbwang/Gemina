 The intermittence of the shape detection signal associated with an entire roller-embedded shapemeter roll , used in a seven-pass cold reversible rolling process , is considered. A transient interference at the sensor top surface and the distance between the sensor top surface and the roll outer surface are developed , and a sensor reliability evaluation model is derived. The reliability of the sensor is evaluated via the random perturbation method , and the reliability sensitivity of design variables is proposed. The analysis reveals that the reliability is smallest in the third rolling pass. Of the design variables considered , the initial interference exhibits the largest reliability sensitivity and has the greatest influence on the sensor reliability. A reliability robust design model of the initial interference is therefore developed. A new shapemeter roll is fabricated and tested in a 1050 reversible cold rolling mill. The test results are consistent with the theoretical results , thereby validating the proposed model. The selection of an appropriate initial interference provides an important means of overcoming the adverse effects associated with the thermal deformation of sensor contact surfaces.
