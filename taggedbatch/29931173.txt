 The Raynaud 's phenomenon ( RP) is characterized by an exaggerated vascular response to cold temperature or emotional stress causing temporary ischemia. It is more prevalent in the digits of the hands and feet , and when occurring in conjunction with a rheumatological condition , it is also termed Raynaud 's syndrome<disease><symptom> , or secondary RP. Healing following a burn requires appropriate tissue perfusion to promote primary restoration of the skin , prevent further burn progression , and to promote skin graft take in wounds<disease><symptom> requiring autologous split skin grafting. The addition of vascular compromise caused by RP to a burn wound<disease><symptom> is therefore hypothesized to impair burn wound<disease><symptom> healing and worsen burn wound<disease><symptom> progression. The authors describe a 51-year-old female with digital burns on a background of scleroderma and Raynaud 's syndrome<disease><symptom> successfully treated with oral sildenafil therapy and autologous split skin grafting. The case report further highlights the potential role for sildenafil therapy in wound<disease><symptom> healing and patients requiring autologous skin grafting or local skin flaps. In future cases , we plan to involve rheumatology services early in the course of the injury aiming to improve outcomes.
