 Motor evoked potentials ( MEPs) are commonly used during neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring. Anesthetic , homeostatic , surgical , and technical factors can cause a change in MEPs. The authors describe a case in which a bolus of magnesium sulfate resulted in a loss of amplitude of MEPs. Responses returned to near baseline about 20 minutes later. The patient did not have any new postoperative deficits. When MEP changes occur , in addition to evaluating other causes , magnesium sulfate administration should be considered.
