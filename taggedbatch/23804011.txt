 Cardiac myxomas are the most frequent primary cardiac tumor in adults. The incidence in pediatric patients is extremely low. Heavy calcification of an atrial myxoma is uncommon in children. An 18-month-old boy was admitted for a significant precordial systolic murmur. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a cardiac mass extending from the inferior vena cava across the right atrium and tricuspid valve into the right ventricle with severe tricuspid regurgitation. According to the echocardiography result , the patient was diagnosed with an inferior vena cava and right atrial tumor with tricuspid regurgitation. After the diagnosis , the patient underwent removal of the tumor via median sternotomy. The mass was removed under cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermia<symptom> circulatory arrest. The tricuspid valve was repaired by valvuloplasty and annuloplasty. The postoperative recovery was unremarkable. Follow-up echocardiogram at 1 month revealed moderate tricuspid regurgitation without myxoma recurrence. Heavy calcification of an atrial myxoma is uncommon especially in children. Definitive therapy for myxomas requires prompt surgical excision and long-term follow-up is recommended in children although recurrence after excision is rare.
