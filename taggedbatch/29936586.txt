 Chicken carcass traits are economically important for the chicken industry. Detecting which genes affect chicken carcass traits is of great benefit to the genetic improvement of this important agricultural species. To investigate the genetic mechanism of carcass traits in chickens , we carried out a genome-wide association study ( GWAS). A total of 435 Chinese indigenous chickens were phenotyped for carcass weight ( CW) , eviscerated weight with giblets ( EWG) , and eviscerated weight ( EW) after slaughter at 91 days and were genotyped using a 600-K single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) genotyping array. Twenty-four birds were selected for sequencing , and the 600 K SNP panel data were imputed to sequence data with the 24 birds as the reference. Univariate GWASs were performed with GEMMA software using the whole genome sequence data imputed from SNP chip data. Finally , 3 , 25 , and 63 suggestively significant SNPs were identified to be associated with carcass weight ( CW) , eviscerated weight with giblets ( EWG) , and eviscerated weight ( EW) , respectively. Six candidate genes , RNF219 , SCEL , MYCBP2 , ETS1 , APLP2 , and PRDM10 were detected. SCEL and MYCBP2 were potentially associated with these three traits , RNF219 and APLP2 were potentially associated with EWG and EW , and ETS1 and PRDM10 were only potentially associated with EWG and EW , respectively. Compared with forefathers ' research , 10 reported QTLs associated with CW were located within a 5-Mb distance near the SNPs with P value lower than 1 Ã— 10
