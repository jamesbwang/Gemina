 The Video Tracking multiple cameras system ( VTS) is a technology that records two-dimensional position data ( x and y) at high sampling rates ( over 25 Hz). The VTS is of great interest because it can record external load variables as well as collect technical and tactical parameters. Performance analysis is mainly focused on physical demands , yet less attention has been afforded to technical and tactical factors. Digital.Stadium ® VTS is a performance analysis device widely used at national and international levels ( i.e. Italian Serie A , Euro 2016) and the reliability evaluation of its technical tagging analysis ( e.g. shots , passes , assists , set pieces) could be paramount for its application at elite level competitions , as well as in research studies. Two professional soccer teams , with 30 male players ( age 23 ± 5 years , body mass 78.3 ± 6.9 kg , body height 1.81 ± 0.06 m) , were monitored in the 2016 season during a friendly match and data analysis was performed immediately after the game ended. This process was then replicated a week later ( 4 operators conducted the data analysis in each week). This study reports a near perfect relationship between Match and its Replication. R2 coefficients ( relationships between Match and Replication) were highly significant for each of the technical variables considered ( p < 0.001). In particular , a high score of interclass correlation and a small coefficient of variation were reported. This study reports meaningless differences between Match and its Replication ( intra-day reliability). We concluded that the semi-automatic process behind the Digital.Stadium ® VTS was more than capable of recording technical tagging data accurately.
