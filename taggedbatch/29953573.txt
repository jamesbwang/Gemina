 Ultrasonography-assessed hyomental distance ( HMD) ratio has been found to discriminate between obese patients with Cormack-Lehane grades 1 or 2 vs. those with grades 3 or 4. The aim of our study is to evaluate the performance of the HMD evaluated ultrasonographically in neutral , ramped , and maximum hyperextended positions , as well as for the ratios obtained by dividing the HMD in the ramped position to that in the neutral position ( HMDR1) and by dividing the HMD in maximum hyperextension to that in the neutral position ( HMDR2) , in order to predict the occurrence of Cormack-Lehane grades 3 or 4 during direct laryngoscopy. Ultrasound measurements were performed preoperatively in 25 patients with morbid obesity , measuring the HMD in the neutral , ramped , and maximum hyperextended positions. Pre-epyglotic soft<disease> tissue thickness , Mallampati and upper<symptom> lip bite test scores were recorded. Cormack-Lehane grading was considered as an outcome variable in the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve analysis. HMD in the neutral , ramped and maximum hyperextended positions presented similar sensitivities , 100 % ( 39.8-100.0). For HMD , specificity was 42.86 % ( 21.8-66.0) in the neutral position , 61.9 % ( 38.4-81.9) in the ramped postion , and 71.4 % ( 47.8-88.7) in the maximum hyperextended position. For HMDR1 , the cut-off value was 1.12. This threshold provides 75 % ( 19.4-99.4) sensitivity and 76.2 % ( 52.8-91.8) specificity. For HMDR2 , a cut-off value of 1.23 provides 100 % ( 39.8-100.0) sensitivity and 90.5 % ( 69.6-98.8) specificity. HMDR2 seems to have superior diagnostic accuracy in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in the obese population compared to HMDR1 , as well as compared to the HMD in the neutral , ramped , and maximum hyperextended positions.
