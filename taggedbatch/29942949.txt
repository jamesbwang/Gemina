 Tumor metastasis has become a major obstacle for the clinical treatment of malignant breast cancer. Thus , a delivery system capable of both antitumor and anti-metastasis efficacy is desired. In this work , a low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH)- based reduction-sensitive delivery system was developed , aiming to combine the properties of both the antitumor drug and active excipients to achieve a synergistic antitumor and anti-metastatic efficiency as well as resolving the potential adverse effects of both doxorubicin and LMWH. That is , the efficiency of DOX could be enhanced and its toxicity could be lowered. Meanwhile , the biological properties of LMWH could be strengthened and its bleeding risk could also be alleviated. Briefly , drug-loaded crosslinked nanoparticles ( DOX/cLLHC2) had a longer blood circulation time and exhibited a rapid reduction-triggered release of DOX. The in vitro assays revealed that DOX/cLLHC2 exhibited a higher cellular uptake and cytotoxicity compared to free DOX. Meanwhile , for the existence of LMWH , DOX/cLLHC2 inhibited cell migration and invasion , as well as effectively inhibited the tube-like formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. DOX/cLLHC2 possessed a superior tumor accumulation compared to lipoic acid unmodified nanoparticles and free DOX. Also , DOX/cLLHC2 exhibited encouraging antitumor and anti-metastasis efficiency in an orthotopic breast cancer model. Overall , DOX/cLLHC2 could exert antitumor , anti-metastasis , and anti-angiogenesis efficacy simultaneously as well as having lower systemic toxicity , which makes it suitable for the therapy of metastatic breast carcinoma.
