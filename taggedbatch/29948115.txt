 We conducted single-cell analyses of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia<pathogen> pastoris to develop a biosensor for the detection of methanol produced by heterologous enzymes. In this biosensor , methanol and its subsequent metabolism induce expression of a gene encoding a fluorescent protein that was placed under the control of a methanol-inducible promoter. Using quantitative analyses of fluorescence microscopy images , a methanol-inducible promoter and a host strain were selected , and preculture and assay conditions were optimized to improve the methanol detection limit. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS) analysis of the distribution and geometric mean of cellular fluorescence intensity against various concentrations of methanol revealed a detection limit of 2.5 Î¼M. Finally , this biosensor was applied to evaluate the activity of a heterologously expressed pectin methylesterase ( PME). The cellular fluorescence intensity was proportional to the copy number of the PME expression cassette , the protein level , and the enzyme activity. This biosensor can be used for high-throughput screening of single cells harboring high methanol-producing activity , and thereby , the development of a bioconversion process using methanol-producing enzymes.
