 To assess the therapeutic effects of microRNA-21 ( miR-21) knockdown ( KD) for acute thoracic spinal<disease> cord contusion using a mouse model. Forty C57/BL6 mice were randomly divided into four groups: mice in the sham-operated ( Sham) group received surgical procedure without spinal<disease> cord contusion; the spinal<disease> cord injury ( SCI) group mice underwent spinal<disease> cord contusion without treatment; mice in the miR-21 KD group underwent spinal<disease> cord contusion followed by a single dose subdural injection of miR-21 KD vectors ( 1 Ã— 10
