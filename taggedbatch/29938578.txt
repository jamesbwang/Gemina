 Japanese<pathogen><disease> encephalitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> ( JE) is an emerging mosquito-borne zoonotic flaviviral disease. The present study was undertaken with the objective to develop TaqMan real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) assay for rapid detection and quantification of Japanese<pathogen><disease> encephalitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> virus<pathogen> ( JEV<pathogen>) in swine blood and mosquito vectors. The amplification of envelope ( E) gene was targeted by designing gene-specific MGB TaqMan fluorescent probe along with the primers. The best performance in terms of sensitivity was achieved by standardized TaqMan real-time RT-PCR with a detection limit of 2.8 copies/reaction and it was found to be 4-log more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR. The applicability of the standardized TaqMan assay was evaluated by screening representative sets of field swine blood samples and mosquito pools for JEV<pathogen>. The viral load ranged between 3.32 Ã— 10
