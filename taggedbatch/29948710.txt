 Phytocapping is increasingly regarded as an economical and environmentally sustainable post-closure landfill management strategy. During 2013 , a phytocap comprised of koala habitat trees was established on a historic landfill site in Lismore as part of an Australian trial program ( A-ACAP). This case study was conducted to determine trace element contamination of the Lismore phytocap soil and foliage , and identify risks to grazing koalas. Foliage of Eucalyptus tereticornis , a key koala food tree , and Acacia melanoxylon , a reference native species , were assessed at the phytocap and an uncontaminated reference site. Concentrations of Ag , As , Hg and Pb were significantly higher in foliage from the phytocap compared to that from the reference site ( p < 0.0001
