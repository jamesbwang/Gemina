 Cognitive function relies on both molecular levels and cellular structures. However , systematic relationships between these two components of cognitive function , and their joint contribution to disease , are largely unknown. We utilize postmortem neuroimaging in tandem with gene expression and DNA methylation , from 222 deeply-phenotyped persons in a longitudinal aging cohort. Expression of hundreds of genes and methylation at thousands of loci are related to the microstructure of extensive regions of this same set of brains , as assessed by MRI. The genes linked to brain microstructure perform functions related to cell motility , transcriptional regulation and nuclear processes , and are selectively associated with Alzheimer 's phenotypes. Similar methodology can be applied to other diseases to identify their joint molecular and structural basis , or to infer molecular levels in the brain on the basis of neuroimaging for precision medicine applications.
