 The article evaluates the effectiveness of a 5-year social norms sexual violence prevention marketing campaign designed specifically for men on a large public university in the Southeastern United States. From 2010 through 2014 , 4,158 men were asked about their self-reported attitudes , beliefs , and behavior related to sexual violence as well as their perception of their peers ' attitudes , beliefs , and behaviors. Using social norms theory , a social norms marketing campaign was developed to target highly discrepant attitudes , beliefs , and behaviors. Results indicate that both self-reported and perception of peer attitudes and beliefs improved over time , and the discrepancy between the two reduced over time. In addition , the frequency of positive and prosocial self-reported behavior increased on five of the six indicators. This study represents a significant contribution to the literature , as it uses 5 years of data and includes behavioral indicators to add evidence for the efficacy of targeting misperceptions of social norms as a mechanism to engage men in gender-based violence prevention.
