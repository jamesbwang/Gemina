 Mycosporine-2-glycine ( M2G) , isolated from the halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica , was purified and characterized in order to determine its utility as a cosmetic and pharmaceutical ingredient. M2G efficiently inhibited protein crosslinking. The inhibitory activity of M2G was significantly greater than that of the well-known Maillard reaction inhibitor aminoguanidine. In addition , M2G and other known mycosporine-like amino acids inhibited bacterial collagenase activity. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report describing that M2G specifically inhibits the formation of advanced glycation end-products ( AGEs) , which play a critical role in ageing process and age-related diseases. These observations indicate that M2G may have potential therapeutic applications by suppressing the formation of AGEs and inhibiting excess collagenase activity.
