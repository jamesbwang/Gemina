 This article examines use of the Doppler endoscopic probe ( DEP) for risk stratification and as a guide to definitive hemostasis of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal ( NVUGI) bleeding and colonic diverticular hemorrhage<symptom>. Studies report that lesions<symptom> with high-risk stigmata of recent hemorrhage<symptom> ( SRH) have a higher rate of a positive DEP signal compared with those without such SRH. Lesions<symptom> with a persistently positive DEP signal after endoscopic hemostasis have a higher 30-day rebleeding rate. Studies document arterial blood flow underneath stigmata of recent hemorrhage<symptom> as a risk factor for rebleeding of focal nonvariceal gastrointestinal lesions<symptom>. With DEP probe as a guide , rates of definitive endoscopic hemostasis and clinical outcomes are improved compared with standard visually guided treatment.
