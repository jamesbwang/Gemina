 This study was performed to compare the clinical outcomes of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty ( UKA) revised to total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) versus primary TKA. Relevant trials were identified via a search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and PubMed from inception to 17 June 2017. A meta-analysis was performed to compare postoperative outcomes between revised UKA and primary TKA with respect to the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC) score , Knee Society Score ( KSS) , mean polyethylene thickness , hospital stay , revision rate , range of motion ( ROM) , and complications. Five of 233 studies involving 536 adult patients ( revised UKA group , n = 209; primary TKA group , n = 327) were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The primary TKA group had better WOMAC scores , KSS , and ROM than the revised UKA group ( P < 0.05). Compared with primary TKA , revision of UKA to TKA required more augments , stems , and bone grafts and a thicker polyethylene component ( P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the revision rate , hospital stay , or complications ( P > 0.05). Conversion of UKA to TKA is associated with poorer clinical outcomes than primary TKA. Furthermore , we believe that conversion of UKA to TKA is more complicated than performing primary TKA. Revision UKA often requires more augments , stems , and bone grafts and thicker polyethylene components than primary TKA. However , patients who undergo conversion of UKA to TKA have similar hospital stay , complications , and revision rate as patients who undergo primary TKA.
