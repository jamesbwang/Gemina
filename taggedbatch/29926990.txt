 Cytotherapy has received considerable attention in the field of cancer therapy , and various chemical or genetic methods have been applied to remold natural cells for improved therapeutic outcome of cytotherapy. A simple method to modify lymphocytes for cancer treatment by using a clinically used molecule , δ-aminolevulinic acid ( δ-ALA) , is reported here. After incubation with this molecule , tumor-targeted lymphocytes spontaneously synthesize anti-neoplastic drug protoporphyrin X ( PpIX) , and specifically accumulate in cancer tissue. Under periodic 630 nm laser irradiation , lymphocytes generate vesicle-like apoptotic body ( Ab) containing the above-produced PpIX , and the facilitated delivery of PpIX from Ab makes an excellent therapeutic effect for Ras-mutated cancer cells under a second irradiation. Importantly , a microfluidic device is further fabricated to simplify cell sorting and drug synthesis with a one-step operation , which could promote generalization of this strategy. In vitro and in vivo studies confirm the success of such an easy-operated and global-regulated strategy for cancer therapy.
