 Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) is a life-threatening disease that has a poor prognosis and low survival rate. Cleavage factor Im 25 ( CFIm25) is a RNA-binding protein that if down-regulated causes 3 ` UTR shortening and thus promotes the transcript stability of target genes. It is not clear whether CFIm25 and alternative polyadenylation ( APA) play a role during cancer development. The purpose of this study is to explore the role of CFIm25 in lung cancer cell proliferation. CFIm25 was knocked down in A549 cells. Western blots were carried out to determine the protein expression of CFIm25 , insulin growth factor 1 receptor ( IGF1R) , CyclinD1 ( CCND1) and TP53. Real-time qRT PCR was performed to determine the total transcript levels of CFIm25 targets and the normalized fold changes in their distal PAS ( dPAS) usage. Immunofluorescence was carried out to check the expression of CFIm25 , IGF1R and CCND1. Cell proliferation over time was determined using the WST-1 reagent. The transcript levels of CCND1 and GSK3β were significantly increased and the dPAS usage of several oncogenes ( IGF1R , CCND1 and GSK3β) were decreased after CFIm25 knockdown. The protein level of IGF1R was increased , and we detected increased percentage of CCND1 positive cells and cell proliferation over time in CFIm25 knockdown cells. In addition , the mRNA and APA analysis of IGF1R using patient RNA-seq data from the Cancer Genome Atlas indicated that IGF1R is shortened in both lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma compared to normal controls. Our findings suggest that CFIm25 plays an important role in lung cancer cell proliferation through regulating the APA of oncogenes , including IGF1R , and promoting their protein expression.
