 MicroRNAs constitute a large family of non-coding RNAs , which actively participate in tumorigenesis by regulating a set of mRNAs of distinct signaling pathways. An altered expression of these molecules has been found in different tumorigenic processes of breast cancer , the most common type of cancer in the female population worldwide. The objective of this review is to discuss how miRNAs become master regulators in breast tumorigenesis. An integrative review of miRNAs and breast cancer literature from the last 5 years was done on PubMed. We summarize recent works showing that the defects on the biogenesis of miRNAs are associated with different breast cancer characteristics. Then , we show several examples that demonstrate the link between cellular processes regulated by miRNAs and the hallmarks of breast cancer. Finally , we examine the complexity in the regulation of these molecules as they are modulated by other non-coding RNAs and the clinical applications of miRNAs as they could serve as good diagnostic and classification tools. The information presented in this review is important to encourage new directed studies that consider microRNAs as a good tool to improve the diagnostic and treatment alternatives in breast cancer.
