 Background In patients with diabetes , hospitalization can complicate the achievement of recommended glycemic targets. There is increasing evidence that a closed-loop delivery system ( artificial pancreas) can improve glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes. We wanted to investigate whether a closed-loop system could also improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who were receiving noncritical care. Methods In this randomized , open-label trial conducted on general wards in two tertiary hospitals located in the United Kingdom and Switzerland , we assigned 136 adults with type 2 diabetes who required subcutaneous insulin therapy to receive either closed-loop insulin delivery ( 70 patients) or conventional subcutaneous insulin therapy , according to local clinical practice ( 66 patients). The primary end point was the percentage of time that the sensor glucose measurement was within the target range of 100 to 180 mg per deciliter ( 5.6 to 10.0 mmol per liter) for up to 15 days or until hospital discharge. Results The mean ( ± SD) percentage of time that the sensor glucose measurement was in the target range was 65.8 ± 16.8 % in the closed-loop group and 41.5 ± 16.9 % in the control group , a difference of 24.3 ± 2.9 percentage points ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 18.6 to 30.0; P < 0.001); values above the target range were found in 23.6 ± 16.6 % and 49.5 ± 22.8 % of the patients , respectively , a difference of 25.9 ± 3.4 percentage points ( 95 % CI , 19.2 to 32.7; P < 0.001). The mean glucose level was 154 mg per deciliter ( 8.5 mmol per liter) in the closed-loop group and 188 mg per deciliter ( 10.4 mmol per liter) in the control group ( P < 0.001). There was no significant between-group difference in the duration of hypoglycemia ( as defined by a sensor glucose measurement of < 54 mg per deciliter; P = 0.80) or in the amount of insulin that was delivered ( median dose , 44.4 U and 40.2 U , respectively; P = 0.50). No episode of severe hypoglycemia or clinically significant hyperglycemia with ketonemia occurred in either trial group. Conclusions Among inpatients with type 2 diabetes receiving noncritical care , the use of an automated , closed-loop insulin-delivery system resulted in significantly better glycemic control than conventional subcutaneous insulin therapy , without a higher risk of hypoglycemia.
