 Validate the content of an instrument that assesses the quality of a software applied to the risk classification of patients. Methodological study , conducted in three stages: adaptation of the instrument , content validation through Delphi technique and pre-test. The results were analyzed through Content Validity Index , Overall Content Validity Index and Inter-rater Reliability. The final version of the instrument comprises 8 characteristics and 28 sub-characteristics , being 37 general questions to computer experts and nurse and 7 specific questions to computer experts , including 1 question and excluding 3 questions of the original instrument. We obtained Overall Content Validity of 92 % and Inter-rater Reliability of 100 % in the second Delphi round. Final considerations: The instrument has content validity , allowing to assess the technical quality and functional performance of the software applied to the risk classification of patients.
