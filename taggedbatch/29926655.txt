 To investigate the effects of hydrogen sulfide ( H Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was induced by isoproterenol ( ISO). The cell surface area was measured by image analysis system ( Leica). The expression of brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP) , β-myosin heavy chain ( β-MHC) , cystathionase ( CSE) , miRNA-133a , calcineurin ( CaN) were detected by qRT-PCR. The protein expressions of CaN 、 nuclear factors of activated T cells ( NFATc4) were detected by Western blot. The concentration of H ① The level of system of CSE/H H
