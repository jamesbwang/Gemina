 The rupture of an intracranial aneurysm<disease> is a sudden , unpredictable and potentially severe event. The responsible aneurysm<disease> has to be excluded from the cerebral circulation to avoid recurrence. More and more commonly , intracranial aneurysms<disease> are detected by coincidence. How to react to these fortuitous discoveries is unclear , because the risk of rupture is difficult to estimate. We present our approach to patients facing this situation and the decision-making process.
