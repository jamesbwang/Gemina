 Intensified hemodialysis ( HD) programs have been developed to overcome the shortcomings of conventional HD. However , there are no data on the implementation of intensified HD programs into routine care. Therefore , we investigated the attitude of nephrologists towards intensified HD , its penetrance into clinical practice , and barriers to implementation. We performed an online survey within the German Society of Nephrology on the beliefs and attitudes towards intensified HD. 44 % of the respondents believe that there is sufficient evidence in favor of intensified HD independent of whether the respondent offers intensified HD or not. Before expanding intensified HD , adequate funding ( 81 %) and more staff ( 60 %) are needed. 44 % of the respondents offer intensified HD to their patients. The offer of intensified HD is made to the patients mainly if the patient is not adequately treated with conventional HD ( 50 %); only 19 % offer it routinely to all patients with CKD stage 4 , in preparation for renal replacement therapy. 33 % of the respondents offer short daily HD , 70 % nocturnal intermittent , and 4 % daily nocturnal. In 30 % of the respondent centers , intensified dialysis is performed at home. Nearly one-half of the respondents already offer intensified HD. Inappropriate funding of intensified HD programs represents the most important barrier for further implementation..
