 Individual assignment and genetic mixture analysis are commonly utilized in contemporary wildlife and fisheries management. Although microsatellite loci provide unparalleled numbers of alleles per locus , their use in assignment applications is increasingly limited. However , next-generation sequencing , in conjunction with novel bioinformatic tools , allows large numbers of microsatellite loci to be simultaneously genotyped , presenting new opportunities for individual assignment and genetic mixture analysis. Here , we scanned the published Atlantic<disease> salmon genome to identify 706 microsatellite loci , from which we developed a final panel of 101 microsatellites distributed across the genome ( average 3.4 loci per chromosome). Using samples from 35 Atlantic<disease> salmon populations (
