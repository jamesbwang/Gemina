 Cell surface glycans , which are tissue-specific and developmentally regulated , work as essential modulators in ligand-receptor interactions , binding to various signal ligands including Wnt , Hedgehog , fibroblast growth factors , epidermal growth factors , and bone morphogenetic proteins , as well as in cell-cell interactions and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. These signals are essential for the stemness and differentiation of various kinds of stem cells. In addition , the intracellular O-linked N-acetylglucosamine , a form of glycosylation found only on nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins , regulates core transcription factors of stemness and phosphorylation of downstream signal components. Therefore , various kinds of glycans regulate the stem cell status; the structures of many of which are evolutionarily conserved from Drosophila to mammals. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of glycans in stemness and differentiation is increasingly important for innovative clinical applications , as well as for basic research. This Review focuses on the roles of glycans in Drosophila tissue stem cells and mammalian pluripotent stem cells.
