 Worldwide , older persons lack access to palliative care. In Sweden , many older persons die in nursing homes where care is provided foremost by assistant nurses. Due to a lack of beds , admission is seldom granted until the older persons have complex care needs and are already in a palliative phase when they move in. To describe assistant nurses ' perspectives of providing care to older persons at the end of life in a nursing home. Data were collected in semi-structured individual interviews and analyzed with inductive qualitative content analysis. Participants and research context: Seven assistant nurses from a nursing home in Sweden were randomly selected. Ethical consideration: The research was approved by the local ethics committee. Three main categories emerged; `` Death a natural part of life ''; `` The older person 's well-being ''; and `` Care in the moment of death ''; and seven sub-categories. The assistant nurses described themselves as knowing the older persons well enough to provide good end-of-life care. This was achieved by making small-talk while providing daily care. Relying on experience-based knowledge , they strove to provide end-of-life care built upon respect and engagement with the ambition to strengthen older persons ' dignity , for example , by lowering the tempo of care at the end of life , in spite of organizational restrictions. The assistant nurses offered attentive end-of-life care , focusing upon bodily care. The existential needs of the older persons were not foregrounded. To develop their work , and to promote an ethical foundation for such care , assistant nurses might need support and education to be able to offer a care more in line with the aims of palliative care. Furthermore , the organization of care needs to promote , not impede , the realization of this development.
