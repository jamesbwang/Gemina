 While fatigue<symptom> is the most common and debilitating side effect of cancer and cancer treatment it is still poorly understood , partly because it is usually characterized by patient-reported outcomes. As patient-reports are inherently subjective , behavioral correlates of the symptom of fatigue<symptom> are needed to increase our understanding of the symptom. We focused on motivational effort expenditure as a crucial behavior in cancer-related fatigue<symptom> , using a validated computerized task contrasting high effort/high reward and low effort/low reward choices under different probabilities of success. Effort expenditure-choices were analyzed in 47 cancer patients differing by their status; current evidence for disease ( n = 17) or post-treatment survivors with no evidence for disease ( n = 30). In addition , patient-reported fatigue<symptom> , negative and positive affect , and biomarkers of inflammation<symptom> were assessed. Patient-reported general and motivational fatigue<symptom> , negative affect , and plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory biomarkers were related to higher effort expenditure while positive affect was associated with lower effort expenditure. As all four measures interacted with patient status , exploratory models were computed for patients and survivors separately. These analyses indicated that the effects of fatigue<symptom> and negative affect were predominantly seen in survivors. In patients still under or shortly post treatment , general fatigue<symptom> , but not motivational fatigue<symptom> , was associated with lower effort expenditure but only in the most favorable reward condition. Negative affect did not have an effect. Thus , the effects observed seemed primarily driven by cancer survivors in whom both fatigue<symptom> and negative affect were associated with higher effort expenditure. These findings are tentatively interpreted to suggest that a tendency to invest more effort despite feelings of fatigue<symptom> is a vulnerability for developing chronic<symptom> fatigue<symptom>. Inflammation<symptom> and negative affect might contribute to fatigue<symptom> in some survivors through this effort investment pathway.
