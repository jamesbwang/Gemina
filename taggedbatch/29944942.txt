 Proteases have gained special research place due to their broader activity spectrum and applied perspectives for different industrial sectors. The present research focused on three aims , i.e. , ( 1) to identify the best protease producer strain among three different Aspergillus strains , ( 2) the development of protease-based cross-linked enzyme aggregates ( CLEAs) and ( 3) silver removal and dehairing potentialities of developed CLEAs. A.<pathogen> flavus<pathogen> gave optimum activity ( 98.50 U/mL) with the culture conditions ( pH -7.5 , 35 °C , inoculum 2.5 mL and fermentation time 48 h) by applying RSM under CCD. The protease-CLEAs were developed with recovery activity ( 37.45 %) by optimizing conditions through RSM under CCD ( 80 % ammonium sulfate , 65 mM glutaraldehyde , and 0.15 mM BSA). The adequacy of the model was checked by ANOVA , and the interactions among different variables were plotted using 3-D graphs. The characterization profile revealed high pH and thermal stability at pH -9 and 60 °C , respectively. The kinetic study revealed lower K
