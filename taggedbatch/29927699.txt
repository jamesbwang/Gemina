 The use of long-term central venous catheters ( CVCs) could lead to serious bloodstream infections. Removal of the infected CVC and reinsertion of a new CVC are not always feasible and alternative lock therapy may be considered. We conducted a multicenter trial to assess the efficacy and safety of the lock therapy. Between October 2013 and August 2014 , we prospectively enrolled 20 patients with catheter-related bloodstream infections ( CRBSIs) or central line-associated bloodstream infections ( CLABSIs) in our sister institutions in three countries including Brazil , Lebanon , and Japan. The 20 patients who received M-EDTA-EtOH lock therapy were compared to 24 control patients who had their CVCs removed and a new CVC inserted. Both groups had comparable clinical characteristics. In the lock therapy group , 95 % of the patients had microbiological eradication within 96 h after starting lock therapy versus 83 % of the patients in the control group ( p = .36). In the lock group , the CVC was salvaged and retained for a median of 21 days ( range 7-51) from the onset of bacteremia. Our study suggests that M-EDTA-EtOH lock therapy may be an effective intervention to salvage long-term CVCs in the setting of CLABSI/CRBSI and hemodialysis cancer patients with limited vascular access.
