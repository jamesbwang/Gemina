 In the United States , school-based mentoring programs are a large and widely funded form of mentoring. Despite widespread support , meta-analyses indicate that the effects of school-based mentoring programs are small. One hypothesis for these results is that school-based mentors are not able to develop a sufficiently high-quality relationship with mentees to produce the hypothesized positive effects. This study presents a reanalysis of a large randomized controlled trial of school-based mentoring and examines the estimated effect of mentoring as a function of mentee-reported relationship quality using a novel statistical approach. Although we found that average effect sizes were near zero and consistent with researchers ' original findings , our findings also indicate that low relationship quality is associated with some harmful effects , particularly on misconduct , and that as relationship quality improves , so do effects. However , we found that this association decelerates and resulted in small , positive effects for some outcomes. These results suggest that that poor relationship quality may produce harmful effects and a strong relationship may not be sufficient to produce moderate , positive academic and behavioral outcomes in a school-based mentoring context.
