 To analyze the effectiveness of enhanced external counterpulsation ( EECP) on recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage ( EIMD). This study followed a crossover , placebo-controlled , counterbalanced design. Ten healthy active subjects ( 7 male; 27 Â± 4 years). Participants performed a plyometric exercise bout ( 10 sets of 10 jumps interspersed with 1-minute rests) and were then assigned to recover for 30 minutes with either EECP ( cuff pressure = 80 mm Hg) or a Sham intervention ( 0 mm Hg) immediately after exercise and at 24 hours after exercise. Two weeks later , they repeated the protocol with the other recovery intervention. Muscle<symptom> soreness<symptom> , creatine kinase ( CK) activity , jump performance , and tensiomyographic variables were measured before exercise , and 24 and 48 hours after exercise. The mean jump height of the plyometric bout did not differ between EECP and Sham ( P > 0.05). Exercise resulted in increased muscle<symptom> soreness<symptom> ( P < 0.001) and CK levels ( P < 0.001) , as well as in impaired jump performance ( P < 0.05). No changes were observed in tensiomyographic variables. No significant differences were found between interventions for any of the study outcomes. No benefits on recovery from EIMD after a plyometric exercise bout were observed with EECP.
