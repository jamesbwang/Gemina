 Podcasts have become an integral part of Free Open Access Medical education. After only 1 year since launching the Anesthesia and Critical Care Reviews and Commentary ( ACCRAC) podcast , more than 7000 people were listening to unique content monthly. The study goal was to capture the listeners ' views of their use of educational podcasts in general and of the ACCRAC podcast in particular. After institutional review board exempt status was obtained , a request was posted on the ACCRAC site inviting users to participate in an anonymous survey. The cross-sectional survey of listeners included 18 items and was open for 2 months between April and June , 2017. A total of 279 listeners of this podcast responded with a 43 % response rate. Of those , 196 ( 71 %) were between the ages of 25 and 34 , and 153 ( 56 %) indicated that podcasts were the most beneficial education modality outside formal didactics. About half , 128 ( 47 %) , reported using podcasts 1 to 2 times per week , and 88 ( 32 %) listened at least 3 times per week. Listeners indicated that on average they had heard 18 episodes ( SD = 11.7 , 40 total) in this series , and over 90 % reported high levels of satisfaction with the podcast. The popularity of the podcast indicates a clear need for this type of educational modality in anesthesiology. The results suggest that there is a demand for podcasts among learners and that those who listen to podcasts do so frequently and value them because they support multitasking and provide flexible access to pertinent information.
