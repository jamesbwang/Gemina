 Accurate assessment of physical activity ( PA) in public health and healthcare settings remains a challenge given limitations of existing brief assessment tools. The Stanford Leisure-Time Activity Categorical Item ( L-Cat) , a single item with six categories , has previously demonstrated excellent reliability and adequate validity relative to pedometer steps. However , pedometers can not assess key dimensions of PA intensity or duration. We evaluated the L-Cat 's criterion validity and sensitivity to change relative to objectively measured Sensewear armband activity monitors among 76 adults with overweight/obesity ( mean age 50.8 ± 11.9 years , BMI = 33.1 ± 3.4 kg m At baseline , L-Cat category was associated with armband-measured daily steps ( Spearman 's ρ = 0.41 , p < 0.001) , total weekly minutes of moderate/vigorous-intensity PA ( MVPA) ( ρ = 0.40 , p < 0.001) and weekly minutes of MVPA accumulated in bouts ≥ 10 min ( ρ = 0.47 , p < 0.0001). Participants increasing ≥ 1 L-Cat category from baseline to 6 months had greater increases in steps ( 1,110.1 ± 1,852.1 vs. -18.0 ± 2,005.6 steps/d , p = 0.032) , total minutes of MVPA ( 145.7 ± 180.6 vs. -2.1 ± 215.8 min/week , p = 0.007) and greater weight<symptom> losses<symptom> ( -7.4 ± 7.7 % vs. -3.1 ± 4.8 % , p = 0.013) than those who stayed the same/decreased L-Cat categories. The L-Cat demonstrated adequate criterion validity and excellent sensitivity to change relative to objectively measured PA among behavioural weight management pilot trial participants. The L-Cat may be particularly useful for identifying individuals at lower activity levels and when using all six categories.
