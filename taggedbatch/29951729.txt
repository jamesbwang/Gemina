 4D flow cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR) imaging allows visualisation of blood flow in the cardiac chambers and great vessels. Post processing of the flow data allows determination of the residence time distribution ( RTD) , a novel means of assessing ventricular function , potentially providing additional information beyond ejection fraction. We evaluated the RTD measurement of efficiency of left and right ventricular ( LV and RV) blood flow. 16 volunteers and 16 patients with systolic dysfunction ( LVEF < 50 %) underwent CMR studies including 4D flow. The RTDs were created computationally by seeding virtual ` particles ' at the inlet plane in customised post-processing software , moving these particles with the measured blood velocity , recording and counting how many exited per unit of time. The efficiency of ventricular flow was determined from the RTDs based on the time constant ( RTDc =- 1/B) of the exponential decay. The RTDc was compared to ejection fraction , T1 mapping and global longitudinal strain ( GLS). There was a significant difference between groups in LV RTDc ( healthy volunteers 1.2 ± 0.13 vs systolic dysfunction 2.2 ± 0.80 , p < 0.001 , C-statistic = 1.0) and RV RTDc ( 1.5 ± 0.15 vs 2.0 ± 0.57 , p = 0.013 , C-statistic = 0.799). The LV RTDc correlated significantly with LVEF ( R =- 0.84 , P < 0.001) and the RV RTDc had significant correlation with RVEF ( R =- 0.402 , p = 0.008). The correlation between LV RTDc and LVEF was similar to GLS and LVEF ( 0.926 , p < 0.001). The ventricular residence time correlates with ejection fraction and can distinguish normal from abnormal systolic function. Further assessment of this method of assessment of chamber function is warranted.
