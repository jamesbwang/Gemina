 Circulating branched-chain amino acids ( BCAAs; isoleucine , leucine , valine) are consistently associated with increased type 2 diabetes ( T2D) risk , but the relationship with dietary intake of BCAAs is less clear. The longitudinal Nurses ' Health Study II cohort conducted a blood collection from 1996 to 1999. We profiled plasma metabolites among 172 incident T2D cases and 175 age-matched controls from women reporting a history of gestational diabetes before blood draw. We estimated dietary energy-adjusted BCAAs from food frequency questionnaires. We used conditional logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios ( OR) and 95 % CI of T2D risk across quartiles ( Q1-Q4) of BCAAs , adjusting for age , body mass index ( BMI) , physical activity , family history , and other established risk factors. We also assessed joint exposure to below/above medians of diet and plasma concentrations , with lower diet/lower plasma as reference. Dietary and plasma BCAA concentrations were positively associated with incident T2D ( diet Q4 vs Q1 OR = 4.6 , CI = 1.6 , 13.4; plasma Q4 vs Q1 OR = 4.4 , CI = 1.4 , 13.4). Modeling the joint association indicated that higher diet BCAAs were associated with T2D when plasma concentrations were also higher ( OR = 6.0 , CI = 2.1 , 17.2) but not when concentrations were lower ( OR = 1.6 , CI = 0.61 , 4.1). Conversely , higher plasma BCAAs were associated with increased T2D for either lower or higher diet. Independent of BMI and other risk factors , higher diet and plasma BCAA concentrations were associated with an increased incident T2D risk among high-risk women with a history of gestational diabetes , supporting impaired BCAA metabolism as conferring T2D risk.
