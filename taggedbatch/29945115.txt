 MicroRNA-137 ( miR-137) plays an important role in the development and progression of many types of human cancers; however , the role of miR-137 in retinoblastoma ( RB) remains unclear. In this study , we aimed to investigate the functional significance and molecular mechanisms of miR-137 in RB. We reported that miR-137 was frequently down-regulated in RB tissues and cell lines. The overexpression of miR-137 inhibited RB cell proliferation and invasion , while the suppression of miR-137 promoted RB cell proliferation and invasion. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2) was a potential target gene of miR-137 , which was validated by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Moreover , our results showed that miR-137 negatively regulated the expression of COX-2 and the production of prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2) in RB cells. The knockdown of COX-2 suppressed the proliferation and invasion of RB cells as well as the production of PGE2. The overexpression of COX-2 significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-137 overexpression on RB cell proliferation and invasion. Taken together , these results suggest that miR-137 suppresses the proliferation and invasion of RB cells by targeting COX-2/ PGE2. Our study reveals a tumor suppressive role of miR-137 in the progression of RB and suggests miR-137 as a potentially effective therapeutic target for the treatment of RB.
