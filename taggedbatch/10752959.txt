 Many neurodegenerative retinal diseases are treated with monoclonal antibodies ( mAb) delivered by invasive intravitreal injection ( IVT). In Diabetic Retinopathy there is a scarcity of effective agents that can be delivered using non-invasive methods , and there are significant challenges in the validation of novel therapeutic targets. ProNGF represents a potential novel target , and IVT administration of a function-blocking anti-proNGF mAb is therapeutic in a mouse model of DR. We therefore compared invasive IVT to less invasive<disease> systemic intravenous ( IV) and local subconjunctival<symptom> ( SCJ) administration , for therapy of Diabetic Retinopathy. The IV and SCJ routes are safe , afford sustained pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of anti-proNGF mAb , and result in long-term therapeutic efficacy that blocks retinal inflammation<symptom> , edema<symptom> , and neuronal death. SCJ may be a more convenient and less-invasive approach for ophthalmic use and may enable reduced frequency of intervention for the treatment of retinal pathologies.
