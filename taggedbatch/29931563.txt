 The whole-blood assay ( WBA) with human fresh blood may provide insight into the features of an individual 's innate immunity. To assess this , ex vivo cytokine release is measured after stimulation of whole blood with various stimuli , for instance , endotoxin in vitro. The aim of the present study was to evaluate WBA reproducibility with fresh blood using different calculation models. The blood was collected from 16 healthy volunteers on 6 different days. Ex vivo stimulation was performed in each individual 's blood sample for 22 h , using different endotoxin concentrations. Interleukin ( IL) -1 β and IL-8 release were quantified using specific immunoassays in the cell-free supernatant. We found that a dose-response relationship between endotoxin and cytokine concentration could be verified for all blood donors in all tests. The median coefficient of variation of the repeated tests was 29 % for IL-1β and 52 % for IL-8. Upon stimulation with 40 pg/mL endotoxin , a confidence interval of 60-140 % was calculated for IL-1β and 70-271 % for IL-8 regarding test reproducibility. Furthermore , the classification into high or low responder was reproducible. We conclude that repeated blood collection offers an opportunity to evaluate the variability of WBA. Considering a high intragroup variability , an individual range assessment has been suggested to evaluate exposure effects.
