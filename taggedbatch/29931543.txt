 Data on cardiovascular disease , including arrhythmias , in Africa is limited. However , the burden of cardiovascular disease appears to be on the rise. Recent global data suggests an increase in atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> rates despite declining rates of rheumatic heart disease. Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> is also associated with increased mortality in Africa. Current management with medical therapy is sub-optimal and ablation procedures , inaccessible. Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> is also an independent risk factor for death in patients with rheumatic heart disease. Sudden cardiac deaths from ventricular arrhythmias are under-recognized and inadequately treated with very high rates out of hospital cardiac arrest due to poor education of the general public on cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills and lack of essential healthcare infrastructure. Use of cardiac devices such as implantable defibrillators and pacemakers is low with significant regional variations and is almost non-existent in sub-Saharan Africa. There is a great unmet need for arrhythmia diagnosis and management in Africa. Governments and healthcare stakeholders need to include cardiovascular disease as a healthcare priority given the rising burden of disease and associated mortality.
