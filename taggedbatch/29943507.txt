 The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dexamethasone ( DEX) on zinc metabolism in goats. In this study , 10 goats were randomly divided into two groups. One group was injected with dexamethasone ( Dex group) and the other group was injected with saline ( Con group). Dex treatment significantly decreased hepatic zinc levels ( p < .01) and increased Zn transporters 1 ( ZNT-1) expression ( p < .05). The concentration of zinc in the cecal and colonic contents was significantly increased ( p < .05). However , zinc levels were increased only in the colon tissues ( p < .05) but not in the cecal tissues ( p > .05). A dramatic increase in Zrt- , Irt-related proteins 14 ( ZIP-14) expression ( p < .05) following Dex treatment was also observed and likely induced the elevated zinc levels in the colon , and a significant reduction in Zip-14 methylation ( p < .05) may be responsible for the observed increase in Zip-14 expression. Together , these results indicate that Dex influences zinc homeostasis by increasing hepatic ZNT-1 and colonic ZIP-14 expression. Additionally , these results provide valuable information for the clinical application of Dex.
