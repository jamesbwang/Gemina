 Many coaching methods have been well studied and formalized , but the approach most commonly used in the continuing education of surgeons is peer coaching. Through a qualitative thematic analysis , we sought to determine if surgeons can comfortably and effectively transition to a co-learner dynamic for effective peer coaching. This qualitative study evaluated 20 surgeons participating in a video review coaching exercise in October 2015. Each conversation was coded by 2 authors focusing on the dynamics of the coach and coachee relationship. Once coded , thematic analysis was performed. Two themes emerged in our analysis: ( 1) Participants often alternated between the roles of coach and coachee , even though they received assigned roles prior to the start of the session. For example , a coach would defer to the coachee , suggesting they felt unqualified to teach a particular technique or procedure. ( 2) The interactions demonstrated bidirectional exchange of ideas with both participants offering expertise when appropriate. For example , the coach and coachee frequently engaged in back-and-forth discussion about techniques , instrument selection , and intraoperative decision-making. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates that surgeons naturally and effectively assume co-learner roles when participating in an early surgical coaching experience.
