 We sought to test the discriminatory ability of the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology ( ISUP) Gleason grading groups ( GGG) for predicting biochemical recurrence ( BCR) after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy ( RARP) in a large , contemporary , Canadian cohort. A total of 621 patients who underwent RARP in two major Canadian centres were identified in a prospectively maintained Canadian database between 2006 and 2016. Followup endpoint was BCR. Log-rank test , univariable , and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used. Mean followup was 27.9 months. All five ISUP GGG independently predicted BCR. Statistically significant differences in BCR rates were found between GGG 2 and GGG 3 strata ( p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences in BCR rates were found between GGG 4 and GGG 5 strata ( p = 0.3). Relative to GGG 1 , the GGG 2 , GGG 3 , GGG 4 , and GGG 5 yielded a 1.10- , 3.44- , 4.18- , and 4.74-fold hazard ratio ( HR) increment in BCR , respectively. This population-based Canadian cohort study confirms the added discriminatory property of the novel ISUP grading , specifically for GGG 2 and GGG 3 strata. No difference , however , was observed between GGG 4 and GGG 5 , likely due to the lower number of patients in these groups. As such , after external validation , the 2014 ISUP GGG appears to retain clinical prognostic significance in a Canadian population.
