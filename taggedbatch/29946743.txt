 Spring viremia of carp ( SVC) is listed as a notifiable viral<disease> disease<disease> by the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE). In 2016 , the first official SVC outbreak was detected in the city of Gyeongsan , Korea. The present study reports the first complete genome analysis of SVC virus ( SVCV , ADC-SVC2016-5) isolated from leather carp ( Cyprinus carpio nudus). The results revealed that ADC-SVC2016-5 has a 11,029-bp genome containing five genes: N , P , M , G , and L. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that ADC-SVC2016-5 ( accession number MG663512) , isolated from leather carp , was closely related to genogroup Ia isolates of the Asian clade. This report provides additional information for studying the molecular epidemiology and evolution of spring viremia of carp virus.
