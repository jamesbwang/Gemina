 Few studies have examined the prevalence of convergence insufficiency ( CI) in a school-based population in Sudan. This study sought to determine the prevalence of CI and its related clinical characteristics among Sudanese secondary school students. A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted in Central Khartoum North , Sudan , in the academic year 2013/2014. A total of 4211 secondary school students , with a mean age of 15.5 Â± 2.5 years , underwent complete eye examination , and were screened for symptoms associated with near work. Near and distance heterophoria was measured with the alternate cover test using a prism bar; near point of convergence ( NPC) and positive fusional vergence ( PFV) at near were determined. Of the 4211 students screened , 329 ( 7.8 %) were diagnosed with CI. Of these , 173 ( 52.6 %) students were male and 156 ( 47.4 %) were female; there was no significant relationship between sex and CI ( These findings suggest that CI is prevalent in the secondary school population in Central Khartoum North , Sudan.
