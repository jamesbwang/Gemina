 In breast reconstruction , it is critical for patients and surgeons to have comprehensive information on the relative risks of the available options. However , previous studies that evaluated complications were limited by single-center designs , inadequate follow-up , and confounding. To assess 2-year complication rates across common techniques for postmastectomy reconstruction in a multicenter patient population. This longitudinal , multicenter , prospective cohort study conducted from February 1 , 2012 , through July 31 , 2015 , took place at the 11 study sites associated with the Mastectomy Reconstruction Outcomes Consortium study. Eligible patients included women 18 years and older presenting for first-time breast reconstruction with at least 2 years of follow-up. Procedures evaluated included direct-to-implant ( DTI) technique , expander-implant ( EI) technique , latissimus dorsi ( LD) flap , pedicled transverse rectus<pathogen> abdominis myocutaneous ( pTRAM) flap , free transverse rectus<pathogen> abdominis myocutaneous ( fTRAM) flap , deep inferior epigastric perforator ( DIEP) flap , and superficial inferior epigastric artery ( SIEA) flap. Postmastectomy breast reconstruction. Development of complications , reoperative complications , and wound<disease><symptom> infections<disease> during 2-year follow-up. Mixed-effects logistic regression analysis controlled for variability among centers and for demographic and clinical variables. A total of 2343 patients ( mean ( SD) age , 49.5 ( 10.1) years; mean ( SD) body mass index , 26.6 ( 5.7)) met the inclusion criteria. A total of 1525 patients ( 65.1 %) underwent EI reconstruction , with 112 ( 4.8 %) receiving DTI reconstruction , 85 ( 3.6 %) pTRAM flaps , 95 ( 4.1 %) fTRAM flaps , 390 ( 16.6 %) DIEP flaps , 71 ( 3.0 %) LD flaps , and 65 ( 2.8 %) SIEA flaps. Overall , complications were noted in 771 ( 32.9 %) , with reoperative complications in 453 ( 19.3 %) and wound<disease><symptom> infections<disease> in 230 ( 9.8 %). Two years postoperatively , patients undergoing any autologous reconstruction type had significantly higher odds of developing any complication compared with those undergoing EI reconstruction ( pTRAM flap: odds ratio ( OR) , 1.91; 95 % CI , 1.10-3.31; P = .02; fTRAM flap: OR , 2.05; 95 % CI , 1.24-3.40; P = .005; DIEP flap: OR , 1.97; 95 % CI , 1.41-2.76; P < .001; LD flaps: OR , 1.87; 95 % CI , 1.03-3.40; P = .04; SIEA flap: OR , 4.71; 95 % CI , 2.32-9.54; P < .001). With the exception of LD flap reconstructions , all flap procedures were associated with higher odds of reoperative complications ( pTRAM flap: OR , 2.48; 95 % CI , 1.33-4.64; P = .005; fTRAM flap: OR , 3.02; 95 % CI , 1.73-5.29; P < .001; DIEP flap: OR , 2.76; 95 % CI , 1.87-4.07; P < .001; SIEA flap: OR , 2.62; 95 % CI , 1.24-5.53; P = .01) compared with EI techniques. Of the autologous reconstructions , only patients undergoing DIEP flaps had significantly lower odds of infection compared with those undergoing EI procedures ( OR , 0.45; 95 % CI , 0.25-0.29; P = .006). However , DTI and EI procedures had higher failure rates ( EI and DTI techniques , 7.1 %; pTRAM flap , 1.2 %; fTRAM flap , 2.1 %; DIEP flap , 1.3 %; LD flap , 2.8 %; and SIEA flap , 0 %; P < .001). Significant differences were noted across reconstructive procedure types for overall and reoperative complications , which is critically important information for women and surgeons making breast reconstruction decisions.
