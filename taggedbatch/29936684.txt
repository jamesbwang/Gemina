 Methionine is the precursor of homocysteine , a sulfur amino acid intermediate in the methylation and transsulfuration pathways; methionine-rich diets were used to induce hyperhomocysteinemia , and cardiovascular pathology was often observed. Other sulfur amino acids interfere with this metabolism , i.e. , L-cysteine ( Cys) and N-aceyl-L-cysteine ( NAC) , and probably also affect cardiovascular system. Their effects are controversial due to their ability to act both as anti- or pro-oxidant. Thus , this study aimed to elucidate their influence on levels of homocysteine , folate and vitamin B12 , levels of different haemostatic parameters ( fibrinogen , D-dimer , vWF Ag , vWF Ac) in rat serum or plasma as well as their effects on cardiac and aortic<disease> tissue histology in subchronically methionine-treated rats. Wistar albino rats were divided into 4 experimental groups: ( a) control group ( 0.9 % sodium chloride 0.1-0.2 mL/day) ( n = 10) ( K); ( b) DL-methionine ( 0.8 mmol/kg/bw/ day) ( n = 10) ( M); ( c) DL-methionine ( 0.8 mmol/kg/bw/ day) + L-cysteine ( 7 mg/kg/bw/ day) ( n = 8) ( C); ( d) DL-methionine ( 0.8 mmol/ kg/bw/day) + N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( 50 mg/kg/bw/ day) ( n = 8) ( N). All substances were applied i.p. , treatment duration 3 weeks. Lower levels of vitamin B12 in all the groups were found. Folate was reduced only in N group. Decreased fibrinogen was noted in C and N groups and increased D-dimer only in C. VWF activity was reduced in M and C groups. Deleterious effects in heart were observed , especially after Cys and NAC application. Aortic<disease> tissue remained unchanged. In conclusion , it could be said that sulfur amino acids have the significant impact on cardiovascular system in subchronically methionine-treated rats. This study points out the relevance of their complex interactions and deleterious effects mediated by either direct influence or procoagulant properties.
