 Fibrosis<disease> of the lung constitutes a major clinical challenge and novel therapies are required to alleviate the associated morbidity and mortality. Investigating the antifibrotic efficacy of drugs that are already in clinical practice offers an efficient strategy to identify new therapies. The phosphodiesterase 4 ( PDE4) inhibitors , approved for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , harbor therapeutic potential for pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> by augmenting the activity of endogenous antifibrotic mediators that signal through cyclic AMP. In this study , we tested the efficacy of several PDE4 inhibitors including a novel compound ( Compound 1) in a murine model of lung<disease> fibrosis<disease> that results from a targeted type II alveolar epithelial cell injury. We also compared the antifibrotic activity of PDE4 inhibition to the two therapies that are FDA-approved for idiopathic pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( pirfenidone and nintedanib). We found that both preventative ( day 0-21) and therapeutic ( day 11-21) dosing regimens of the PDE4 inhibitors significantly ameliorated the weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and lung collagen accumulation that are the sequelae of targeted epithelial cell damage. In a therapeutic protocol , the reduction in lung<disease> fibrosis<disease> with PDE4 inhibitor administration was equivalent to pirfenidone and nintedanib. Treatment with this class of drugs also resulted in a decrease in plasma surfactant protein D concentration , a reduction in the plasma levels of several chemokines implicated in lung<disease> fibrosis<disease> , and an in vitro inhibition of fibroblast profibrotic gene expression. These results motivate further investigation of PDE4 inhibition as a treatment for patients with fibrotic lung disease.
