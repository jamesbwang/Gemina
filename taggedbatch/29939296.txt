 A recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus ( rVSV) expressing the Marburg<pathogen><disease> virus ( MARV) Musoke variant glycoprotein fully protects macaques against 2 MARV variants and Ravn virus as a preventive vaccine and MARV variant Musoke as a postexposure treatment. To evaluate postexposure efficacy against the most pathogenic MARV variant , Angola , we engineered rVSVs expressing homologous Angola glycoprotein. Macaques were challenged with high or low doses of variant Angola and treated 20-30 minutes after exposure. A total of 25 % and 60 % -75 % of treated macaques survived the high-dose and low-dose challenges , respectively. The more rapid disease progression of variant Angola versus variant Musoke may account for the incomplete protection observed.
