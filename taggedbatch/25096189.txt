 The high pretreatment plasma fibrinogen has been widely reported to be a possible biomarker for predicting prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) and pancreatic carcinoma ( PC) , but persuasive conclusion has not been made yet. Thus , we herein conducted a meta-analysis to comprehensively assess the prognostic value of high pretreatment plasma fibrinogen in patients with HCC and PC. We systematically searched PubMed , EMBASE , and Web of Science to identify eligible studies from inception to November 10 , 2017. Finally , a total of 12 publications with 13 studies were included. Of these eligible studies , 5 publications with 6 studies were about pancreatic cancer and 7 were about HCC. The pooled analysis indicated that high plasm fibrinogen level was significantly related to worse overall survival ( OS) in HCC ( hazard ratio ( HR) = 1.87; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.55-2.24; P < .01). Similarly , from our result , it was found that high plasm fibrinogen was also significantly associated with worse OS in PC ( HR = 1.56; 95 % CI: 1.13-2.15; P < .01). Taken together , our meta-analysis confirmed that high plasma fibrinogen level could predict worse survival in HCC and PC.
