 The field of urology encompasses all benign and malignant disorders of the urinary<disease> tract and the male genital<disease> tract. Urological disorders convey a huge economic and patient quality-of-life burden. Hospital acquired urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> , in particular , are under scrutiny as a measure of hospital quality. Given the prevalence of these pathologies , there is much progress still to be made in available therapeutic options in order to minimize side effects and provide effective care. Current drug delivery mechanisms in urological malignancy and the benign urological conditions of overactive bladder ( OAB) , interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome<disease><symptom> ( IC/BPS) , and urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( UTI) will be reviewed herein. Both systemic and local therapies will be discussed including sustained release formulations , nanocarriers , hydrogels and other reservoir systems , as well as gene and immunotherapy. The primary focus of this review is on agents which have passed the preclinical stages of development.
