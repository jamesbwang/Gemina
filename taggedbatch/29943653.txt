 Early recognition of patients developing acute kidney injury is of considerable interest , we report the first use of a combination of a clinical prediction rule with a biomarker in emergent adult medical patients to improve AKI recognition. Single-centre prospective pilot study of medical admissions without AKI identified as high risk by a clinical prediction rule. Urine samples were obtained and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 ( TIMP-2) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 ( IGFBP7)- biomarkers associated with cell cycle arrest , were measured. Creatinine based KDIGO hospital-acquired AKI ( HA-AKI). Of 69 patients recruited , HA-AKI developed in 13 % ( n = 9) , in whom biomarker values were higher ( median 0.43 ( interquartile range 0.21-1.25) vs. 0.07 ( 0.03-0.16) in cases without ( P = 0.008). Peak rise in creatinine was higher in biomarker positive cases ( median 30 μmol/l ( 7-72) vs 1 μmol/l ( 0-16) , P = 0.002). AUROC was 0.78 ( 95 % CI 0.57-0.98). At the suggested cut-off ( 0.3) sensitivity for predicting AKI was 78 % ( 95 % CI 40-97 %) , specificity 89 % ( 78-95 %) , positive predictive value 50 % ( 31-69 %) and negative predictive value 96 % ( 89-99 %). Addition of a urinary biomarker allows exclusion of a significant number of patients identified to be at higher risk of AKI by a clinical prediction rule.
