No relevant evidence was found regarding the use of other social media platforms. Most studies indicated positive findings regarding health professionals ' intention to use discussion forums , while the one study that used a collaborative project also indicated positive findings with its perceived ease of use as health professionals felt that it was useful to facilitate chronic<disease> disease<disease> self-management with patients.
