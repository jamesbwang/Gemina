 Chronic back pain is a leading cause of disability worldwide and it is still inadequately treated. Tapentadol is a dual-acting analgesic drug Î¼-opioid receptor ( MOR) agonist/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor , carrying a lower risk for opioid withdrawal symptoms and opioid-related adverse effects in comparison to potent opioid drugs. This study investigates the effectiveness , safety and tolerability of the prolonged release oral formulation of tapentadol ( tapentadol PR) in 27 patients affected by refractory chronic low<symptom> back pain during a long-term follow-up ( up to 51 months). This is an observational study conducted at the Pain Therapy and Palliative Care Unit of University Hospital of Cagliari , Italy. We enrolled 27 patients affected by chronic low<symptom> back<symptom> pain<symptom> refractory to other pharmacological treatments according to the inclusion criteria. We prospectively evaluated oral tapentadol PR therapy during a long-term follow-up ( up to 51 months) according to the following outcomes: pain intensity during the previous 72 hours ( Numeric Rating Scale 3) , quality of life ( Short Form-12 Health Survey) , self-reported treatment effectiveness ( Patient Global Impression of Change scale) , physician evaluation of treatment effectiveness ( Clinician Global Impression of Change scale) , treatment-related adverse effects , reason for tapentadol therapy interruption and tapentadol dosage. All the patients reported a significant improvement of pain intensity and quality of life at the last follow-up. These results show the long-term effectiveness , safety and tolerability of oral tapentadol PR for the treatment of refractory chronic low<symptom> back pain in a real-life clinical setting.
