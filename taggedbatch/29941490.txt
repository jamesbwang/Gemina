 Cancer cells often heavily depend on the ubiquitin-proteasome system ( UPS) for their growth and survival. Irrespective of their strong dependence on the proteasome activity , cancer cells , except for multiple myeloma , are mostly resistant to proteasome inhibitors. A major cause of this resistance is the `` proteasome bounce-back response '' mediated by NRF1 , a transcription factor that coordinately activates proteasome subunit genes. To identify new targets for efficient suppression of UPS , we explored using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry the possible existence of nuclear proteins that co-operate with NRF1 and identified
