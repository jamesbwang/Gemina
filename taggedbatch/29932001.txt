 Bisphosphonates have previously been shown to increase the density of impacted graft bone. In the present study we hypothesise that bisphosphonates also reduce early stem subsidence. We examined the effect of locally applied bisphosphonate to allografts on prosthetic micromotion and bone density in femoral stem revision with impaction grafting. 37 patients were randomised to either clodronate or saline as local adjunct to the morsellised allograft bone. 24 patients were finally analysed per protocol and evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA) during the first year and with radiostereometric analysis ( RSA<pathogen>) for 5 years. There were no significant differences neither in bone density , nor in migratory behaviour between the groups. The femoral stems had subsided 3.6 mm in both groups ( p = 0.99) at 5 years and there was no difference as measured over time with mixed models analysis. The clinical outcome was good in both groups. Clodronate as a local addendum to allograft bone in hip revision did not increase bone density or reduce micromotion of the implant.
