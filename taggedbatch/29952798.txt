 To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of combined epithelium-off cross-linking ( CXL) with photorefractive keratectomy ( CXL Plus) for correction of the myopic and astigmatic components of keratoconus. Seventy-nine eyes of 46 patients who underwent CXL Plus were enrolled in this retrospective , multicenter , noncomparative clinical study. Uncorrected distance visual acuity , corrected distance visual acuity , refraction , keratometry , and pachymetry measurements were recorded preoperatively and at 3 , 6 , 12 , and 18 months during follow-up. The mean ( ± SD) preoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity and corrected distance visual acuity were 1.00 ± 0.22 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution ( logMAR) and 0.62 ± 0.38 logMAR , respectively , and improved to 0.71 ± 0.36 logMAR and 0.32 ± 0.18 logMAR postoperatively. The mean k value , mean corneal thickness at the thinnest location , and mean myopic and astigmatic components decreased from 46.58 ± 0.97 D , 473 ± 29 μm , 3.65 ± 1.72 D , and 1.83 ± 0.69 D preoperatively to 43.79 ± 1.17 D , 431 ± 38 μm , 1.02 ± 0.78 D , and 1.15 ± 0.26 D , respectively , during follow-up. Eleven eyes had delayed epithelial healing , 2 had stromal opacities , 1 had primary herpes<disease> simplex<pathogen><disease> keratitis<disease><symptom> , and 5 showed progression of keratoconus. CXL Plus improved the refractive status of keratoconus during 18 months of follow-up , despite its potential early postoperative complications of delayed epithelial healing and corneal haze. CXL Plus reduced the myopic component more than the astigmatic component of keratoconus. However , the safety and stability of the procedure were offset by longer-term postoperative complications and a high rate of postoperative progression of keratoconus.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
