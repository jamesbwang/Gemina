 Nanostructures have attracted huge interest as a rapidly growing class of materials for many applications. Several techniques have been used to characterize the size , crystal structure , elemental composition and a variety of other physical properties of nanoparticles. In several cases , there are physical properties that can be evaluated by more than one technique. Different strengths and limitations of each technique complicate the choice of the most suitable method , while often a combinatorial characterization approach is needed. In addition , given that the significance of nanoparticles in basic research and applications is constantly increasing , it is necessary that researchers from separate fields overcome the challenges in the reproducible and reliable characterization of nanomaterials , after their synthesis and further process ( e.g. annealing) stages. The principal objective of this review is to summarize the present knowledge on the use , advances , advantages and weaknesses<symptom> of a large number of experimental techniques that are available for the characterization of nanoparticles. Different characterization techniques are classified according to the concept/group of the technique used , the information they can provide , or the materials that they are destined for. We describe the main characteristics of the techniques and their operation principles and we give various examples of their use , presenting them in a comparative mode , when possible , in relation to the property studied in each case.
