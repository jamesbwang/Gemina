 Previous studies have demonstrated associations between higher blood glucose and brain atrophy and functional deficits , however , little is known about the association between blood glucose , striatal volume and striatal function despite sensori-motor deficits being reported in diabetes. This study investigated the relationship between blood glucose levels , striatal volume and fine motor skills in a longitudinal cohort of cognitively healthy individuals living in the community with normal or impaired fasting glucose or type 2 diabetes. Participants were 271 cognitively healthy individuals ( mean age 63 years at inclusion) with normal fasting glucose levels ( < 5.6 mmol/L) ( n = 173) , impaired fasting glucose ( 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) ( n = 57) , or with type 2 diabetes ( â‰¥ 7.0 mmol/L) ( n = 41). Fasting glucose , Purdue Pegboard scores as measurement of fine motor skills , and brain scans were collected at wave 1 , 2 and 4 , over a total follow-up of twelve years. Striatal volumes were measured using FreeSurfer after controlling for age , sex and intracranial volume. Results showed that type 2 diabetes was associated with smaller right putamen volume and lower Purdue Pegboard scores after controlling for age , sex and intracranial volume. These findings add to the evidence suggesting that higher blood glucose levels , especially type 2 diabetes , may impair brain structure and function.
