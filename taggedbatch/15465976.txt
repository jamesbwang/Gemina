 The Forty patients with schizophrenia were treated with aripiprazole for 6 weeks. We measured Positive and Negative Syndrome<disease><symptom> Scale ( PANSS) and plasma levels of homovanillic acid ( HVA) and plasma MHPG ( 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol) at baseline and endpoint. The There were significant genotype-time interactions on PANSS total and general psychopathology scores , with Met/Met genotype showing greater improvement. The response rate to aripiprazole did not differ between Our results suggest that individuals with the Met/Met genotype had greater improvement in PANSS score after the treatment with aripiprazole. On the other hand , the Val 108/158 Met polymorphism may not induce changes in plasma levels of monoamine metabolites during aripiprazole treatment. Because of the small sample size , further studies are needed to confirm and to extend our results.
