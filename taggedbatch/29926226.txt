 While originally cloned from the prostate in 2001 , transient receptor potential , melastatin member 8 ( TRPM8) has since been identified as the cold/menthol receptor in the peripheral nervous system. This discovery has led to hundreds of studies regarding the role of this channel in pain and thermosensation phenomena , while relegating TRPM8 involvement in cancer to a secondary role. Despite these findings , there is growing evidence that TRPM8 should be carefully studied within the frame of carcinogenesis , especially in the prostate , where it is highly expressed and where many teams have confirmed variations in its expression during cancer progression. Its regulation by physiological factors , such as PSA and androgens , has proved that TRPM8 can exhibit an activity beyond that of a cold receptor , thus explaining how the channel can be activated in organs not exposed to temperature variations. With this review , we aim to provide a brief overview of the current knowledge regarding the complex roles of TRPM8 in prostate carcinogenesis and to show that this research path still represents a `` hot '' topic with potential clinical applications in the short term.
