 The effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the minimum alveolar concentration ( MAC) values of sevoflurane and desflurane in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) complicated with jaundice were investigated. Eighty patients with HCC complicated with jaundice were selected. Forty patients underwent the neoadjuvant chemotherapy and were grouped into the desflurane group ( Group D) and the sevoflurane group ( Group S). Patients in all chemotherapy groups received 2 cycles of chemotherapy prior to surgery and underwent surgical treatment 3 weeks after chemotherapy. The remaining 40 patients in the control group were divided into the desflurane group ( Group C1) and the sevoflurane group ( Group C2). Changes in MAP , HR and BIS at different time points before and after anesthesia induction and skin incision were compared among the groups. Results showed that there were no significant differences in MAP , HR and BIS before anesthesia induction ( T0) ( P > 0.05); at each time point from T1 to T6 , MAP , HR and BIS of Group D were significantly lower than those of Group C1 ( P > 0.05). Furthermore , MAP , HR and BIS of Group S were significantly lower than those of Group C2 ( P > 0.05). The MAC
