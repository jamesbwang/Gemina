 Neuronal fate determination and maturation requires an intricate interplay between genetic programs and environmental signals. However , disentangling the roles of intrinsic vs. extrinsic mechanisms that regulate this differentiation process is a conundrum for all developmental neurobiologists. This issue is magnified for GABAergic interneurons , an incredibly heterogeneous cell population that is born from transient embryonic structures and undergo a protracted migratory phase to disperse throughout the telencephalon. To explore how different brain environments affect interneuron fate and maturation , we developed a protocol for harvesting fluorescently labeled immature interneuron precursors from specific brain regions in newborn mice ( P0-P2). At this age , interneuron migration is nearly complete and these cells are residing in their final resting environments with relatively little synaptic integration. Following collection of single cell solutions via flow cytometry , these interneuron precursors are transplanted into P0-P2 wildtype postnatal pups. By performing both homotopic ( e.g. , cortex-to-cortex) or heterotopic ( e.g. , cortex-to-hippocampus) transplantations , one can assess how challenging immature interneurons in new brain environments affects their fate , maturation , and circuit integration. Brains can be harvested in adult mice and assayed with a wide variety of posthoc analysis on grafted cells , including immunohistochemical , electrophysiological and transcriptional profiling. This general approach provides investigators with a strategy to assay how distinct brain environments can influence numerous aspects of neuron development and identify if specific neuronal characteristics are primarily driven by hardwired genetic programs or environmental cues.
