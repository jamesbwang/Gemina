 Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy ( ICP) is frequently accompanied by pruritus , whose etiology has been associated with an enhanced production of lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA) by the combined action of phospholipase A1/A2 ( PLA1/PLA2) and autotaxin ( ATX). Here we have investigated whether the placenta is involved in LPA release to maternal circulation during ICP. Serum levels of ATX and LPA ( determined by ELISA) were elevated in women with ICP , and a correlation between both parameters was found. No relationship between serum levels of ATX or LPA and bile acids was found. Expression levels of ATX and PLA2 were determined by RT-qPCR and western blot. Placenta ATX but not PLA2 was significantly upregulated in ICP , and a tendency to increase was found at protein level. A correlation between serum ATX and placental ATX mRNA levels was found. In human placenta at term , ATX was clearly detected ( by immunofluorescence) in Hofbauer cells , but only faintly in trophoblast cells. In pregnant rats , the expression of Atx and Pla2 in placenta was lower than in liver. When obstructive cholestasis was imposed by bile duct ligation from day 14 of gestation until term , placenta Atx and Pla2 expression was markedly enhanced and over-expression was confirmed at protein level for Pla2 , while Atx protein was not detected. In conclusion , the placenta substantially participates in LPA production during gestation. This contribution is markedly higher during maternal cholestasis and may hence be involved in ICP-associated pruritus.
