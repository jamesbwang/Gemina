 Cost of getting health services is a major concern in Bangladesh as well as in many other countries. A family has to bear more than half of the health care cost despite many facilities provided by the public hospitals. This out-of-pocket ( OOP) expenditure drives many families under the poverty line. The aim of this study was to find out the exact cost incurred by the family for a surgical operation of their child in the public and private sectors in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was conducted to find out the cost of child surgery in different settings of public and private hospitals in Chittagong division , Bangladesh. Cost of herniotomy was then compared across different settings. In this study , cost of operation in urban private hospitals was highest mostly due to surgeon and anesthetist fee. The cost was lowest in outreach programs as surgeon fee , anesthetist fee and accommodation cost was nil; food and transport cost was minimum. However , cost of accommodation , food , transport and medicine contributed significantly to OOP expenditure especially in tertiary-level public hospitals , in both indoor and day care settings , and also in private urban hospitals. Our study provides some insight into the OOP expenditure in different health care settings in Bangladesh. This study might be useful in developing a strategy to minimize the OOP expenditure in this country.
