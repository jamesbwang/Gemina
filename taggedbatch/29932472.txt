 All living cells are covered with a dense `` sugar-coat '' of carbohydrate chains ( glycans) conjugated to proteins and lipids. The cell surface glycome is determined by a non-template driven process related to the collection of enzymes that assemble glycans in a sequential manner. In mammals , many of these glycans are topped with sialic acids ( Sia) , a large family of acidic sugars. The `` Sialome '' is highly diverse owing to various Sia types , linkage to underlying glycans , range of carriers , and complex spatial organization. Presented at the front of cells , Sia play a major role in immunity and recognition of `` self '' versus `` non-self , '' largely mediated by the siglecs family of Sia-binding host receptors. Albeit many mammalian pathogens have evolved to hijack this recognition system to avoid host immune attack , presenting a fascinating host-pathogen evolutionary arms race. Similarly , cancer cells exploit Sia for their own survival and propagation. As part of this ongoing fitness , humans lost the ability to synthesize the Sia type N-glycolylneuraminic acid ( Neu5Gc) , in contrast to other mammals. While this loss had provided an advantage against certain pathogens , humans are continuously exposed to Neu5Gc through mammalian-derived diet ( eg , red meat) , consequently generating a complex immune response against it. Circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies together with Neu5Gc on some human tissues mediate chronic inflammation<symptom> `` xenosialitis '' that exacerbate various<disease> human<disease> diseases<disease> ( eg , cancer and atherosclerosis). Similarly , Neu5Gc-containing xenografts are exposed to human anti-Neu5Gc antibodies with implications to sustainability. This review aimed to provide a glimpse into the evolution of Sia and their implications to xenotransplantation.
