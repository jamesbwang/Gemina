 The estimation of glomerular filtration rate ( GFR) plays a vital role in assessment of the renal function. This study evaluated the performance of the CKD-EPI The objectives if the study were to compare the of CKD-EPI Records of adult patients with measured GFR performed at the Nuclear Medicine Department at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital , Durban , South Africa from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2016 were reviewed. eGFR for all included patients was calculated using the MDRD equation without African American correction factor and the CKD-EPI After exclusion , 287 patients were included for analysis with sufficient numbers for only the Black African and Indian patients. None of the equations showed accuracy of eGFR within 30 % of measured GFR for 90 % of patients. In the Black African population , the CKD-EPI None of the evaluated equations attained the 2002 KDOQI benchmark of P
