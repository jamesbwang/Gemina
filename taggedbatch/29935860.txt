 Mycobacterial infections greatly affect human and animal health worldwide , and vaccines are effective , sustainable and economic interventions for the prevention and control of these infectious<disease> diseases<disease>. Recent results support the use of zebrafish as a model for studying the pathophysiology of mycobacterial infection and for the development of novel interventions for tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) control. Recently , we showed that oral immunization with the heat-inactivated M.<pathogen> bovis<pathogen> vaccine ( M.<pathogen> bovis<pathogen> IV) protect wild boar against TB , and suggested that this vaccine may controls mycobacterial infection in other species. In this study we evaluated the effect of M.<pathogen> bovis<pathogen> IV on the control of mycobacteriosis in zebrafish mucosally vaccinated by immersion and challenged intraperitoneally with Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> marinum<pathogen>. The results showed that the M.<pathogen> bovis<pathogen> IV administered by immersion protected zebrafish against mycobacteriosis caused by M.<pathogen> marinum<pathogen> by reduction in mycobacterial infection , the number of mycobacteria per granuloma<disease> and the number of granulomas<disease> per fish. An IgM antibody response against M.<pathogen> bovis<pathogen> antigens was developed in vaccinated fish. Evidences suggested that the protective mechanism elicited by mucosal vaccination with M.<pathogen> bovis<pathogen> IV in zebrafish was based on the activation of the innate immune response through the C3 pathway. These results support the use of the M.<pathogen> bovis<pathogen> IV administered by immersion for the control of mycobacteriosis in fish.
