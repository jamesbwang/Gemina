 The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of add-on therapy of cabergoline versus raloxifene to long-acting somatostatin analogues ( SAs) in patients with inadequately controlled acromegaly. This was a prospective , randomized open label clinical trial. Forty-four patients ( 22 per group) completed the study; where participants received either cabergoline ( 3 mg/week) or raloxifene ( 60 mg twice daily) add-on therapy for 12 weeks in a parallel manner. The primary outcome was the rate of reduction in serum insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1) from baseline. Secondary outcomes comprised normalization of serum IGF-1 for age and sex. Serum IGF-1 was significantly decreased in both the cabergoline ( 40.3 ± 25.6 % , P < .001) and raloxifene ( 31.5 ± 24.6 % , P < .001) groups , with no significant difference between arms ( P > .05). Normalization in serum IGF-1 values occurred in 40.9 % of patients who were on cabergoline compared to 45.5 % of those receiving raloxifene ( P = .76). The subsequent logistic regression analysis highlighted baseline IGF-1 as a significant predictor of IGF-1 normalization ( odds ratio , 0.995; 95 % confidence interval , 0.990-0.999; P = .02). Using the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis for the entire group , the baseline IGF-1 value of 1.47 the upper limit of normal ( ULN) was the best cut-off point to identify patients with normal IGF-1 at the end of the study ( sensitivity: 52.6 % , specificity: 84.0 % , Yoden 's index: 0.366). Full biochemical control of acromegaly was achieved in 22.7 % of patients in the cabergoline group compared to 13.6 % of those in the raloxifene group ( P = .43). Cabergoline and raloxifene add-on therapy could effectively decrease serum IGF-1 level in patients with inadequately controlled acromegaly. The efficacy profiles of both drugs are comparable. DA = dopamine agonist; FBG = fasting blood glucose; GH = growth hormone; IGF1 = insulin-like growth factor-1; IQR = interquartile range; OR = odds ratio; ROC = receiver operating characteristic; SA = somatostatin analogue; SERM = selective estrogen modulator receptor; ULN = upper limit of normal.
