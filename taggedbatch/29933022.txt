 Clinically , traumatic brain injury ( TBI) results in complex heterogeneous pathology that can not be recapitulated in single pre-clinical animal model. Therefore , we focused on evaluating utility of nanoparticle ( NP)- based therapeutics following three diffuse-TBI models: mild-closed-head injury ( mCHI) , repetitive-mCHI and midline-fluid percussion injury ( FPI). We hypothesized that NP accumulation after diffuse TBI correlates directly with blood-brain-barrier permeability. Mice received PEGylated-NP cocktail ( 20-500nm) ( intravenously) after single- or repetitive- ( 1 impact/day , 5 consecutive days) CHI ( immediately) and midline-FPI ( 1h , 3h and 6h). NPs circulated for 1h before perfusion/brain extraction. NP accumulation was analyzed using fluorescent microscopy in brain regions vulnerable to neuropathology. Minimal/no NP accumulation after mCHI/RmCHI was observed. In contrast , midline-FPI resulted in significant peak accumulation of up to 500nm NP at 3h post-injury compared to sham , 1h , and 6h groups in the cortex. Therefore , our study provides the groundwork for feasibility of NP-delivery based on NP-injection time and NP-size after mCHI/RmCHI and midline-FPI.
