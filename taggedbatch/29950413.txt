 The mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental damage caused by virus infections remain poorly defined. Congenital human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV) infection is the leading cause of fetal brain development disorders. Previous work has linked HCMV to perturbations of neural cell fate , including premature differentiation of neural progenitor cells ( NPCs). Here we show that HCMV infection of NPCs results in the loss of the SOX2 protein , a key pluripotency-associated transcription factor. SOX2 depletion maps to the HCMV major immediate-early ( IE) transcription unit and is individually mediated by the IE1 and IE2 proteins. IE1 causes SOX2 down-regulation by promoting the nuclear accumulation and inhibiting the phosphorylation of STAT3 , a transcriptional activator of SOX2 expression. Deranged signaling resulting in depletion of a critical stem cell protein is an unanticipated mechanism by which the viral major IE proteins may contribute to brain development disorders caused by congenital HCMV infection.
