 Recent evidence indicates that increased frailty is associated with increased mortality in patients with burn over the age of 65 years. However , the effect of frailty may not be restricted to those over the age of 65 years. We hypothesize that admission frailty is associated with mortality in patients with burn ≥ 50 years of age. We performed a 5-year ( 2008-2013) retrospective review of patients with acute burn aged 50 years or older. Data collected included demographics , injury characteristics , outcomes , and discharge disposition. Frailty scores ( FS) were calculated using the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Clinical Frailty Scale. Values are expressed as mean ± SD. About 502 patients with a mean age of 63.5 ± 10.7 years were ansalyzed. Mean TBSA was 11.7 ± 14.1 % , 47 patients ( 9.4 %) died , and mean FS was 3.7 ± 1.2 ( 7 being worst and 1 best). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated an independent association between mortality and FS of ≥ 5 ( odds ratio ( OR) , 1.94; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.3 to 2.8). Patients who were ≥ 65-years-old had significantly higher FS ( 4.2 ± 1.2 vs 3.5 ± 1.1) , and more deaths ( 26 vs 21 patients). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that increased admission FS is associated with increased mortality to a greater extent in the 50- to 65-year-old group ( age 50-65 years: OR , 2.5; 95 % CI , 1.4 to 4.6; age ≥ 65 years: OR , 1.63; 95 % CI , 1.003 to 2.7). FS on admission allow for an improved assessment of preinjury physiological condition in patients with burn aged ≥ 50 years. Poor<symptom> preinjury physiological fitness is associated with increased risk of death in patients with burn aged ≥ 50 years.
