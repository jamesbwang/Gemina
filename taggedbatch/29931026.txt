 A novel organic-inorganic hybrid was prepared by anchoring ( 3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane ( APTES) on the surface of monolayer titanate nanosheets and subsequent modification with hydrophilic polyethylene glycol ( PEG). The PEGylated hydrophilic monolayer titanate nanosheets were abbreviated as PEG-APTES-TiNSs , and they exhibit a lateral dimension of dozens of nanometers and a thickness of ca. 1.9 nm. PEGylation of the titanate nanosheets significantly improved their selectivity toward the adsorption of glycoproteins through strong hydrophilic interaction , providing an adsorption capacity of 2540.9 mg g-1 for immunoglobulin G ( IgG). The retained IgG is readily collected at a recovery rate of 83.4 % with 0.5 % ( m/v) ammonium hydroxide ( NH4OH) as the stripping reagent. PEG-APTES-TiNSs are applied for the selective adsorption of IgG from human serum , which is further confirmed by SDS-PAGE assay.
