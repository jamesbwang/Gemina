 Differences in gene regulation between human and closely related species influence phenotypes that are distinctly human. While gene regulation is a multi-step process , the majority of research concerning divergence in gene regulation among primates has focused on transcription. To gain a comprehensive view of gene regulation , we surveyed genome-wide ribosome occupancy , which reflects levels of protein translation , in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from human , chimpanzee , and rhesus macaque. We further integrated messenger RNA and protein level measurements collected from matching cell lines. We find that , in addition to transcriptional regulation , the major factor determining protein level divergence between human and closely related species is post-translational buffering. Inter-species divergence in transcription is generally propagated to the level of protein translation. In contrast , gene expression divergence is often attenuated post-translationally , potentially mediated through post-translational modifications. Results from our analysis indicate that post-translational buffering is a conserved mechanism that led to relaxation of selective constraint on transcript levels in humans.
