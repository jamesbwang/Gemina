 Different epidemiological studies have found that backyard chickens are a reservoir for poultry diseases. Most backyard chicken flocks have a poor level of biosecurity , which increases the risk of spread of diseases. In recent years , the number of backyard chickens has been on the rise in Iran. However , the health status of backyard flocks is still poorly documented. Thus , this study aimed at examining the seroprevalence of antibodies against infectious bronchitis<symptom> virus ( IBV) and molecular surveillance and genotyping of IBV among backyard chickens ( without vaccination history) in Mazandaran province , North of Iran , 2014. A total of 460 blood samples of unvaccinated backyard chickens in the mentioned area were tested for antibodies against IBV using commercial ELISA. Also , cecal tonsils were collected from 75 chickens in the same area. Real time RT-PCR ( for detection) and RT-PCR and sequencing spike gene were performed. The seropositivity rate was 54.5 %. In addition , we detected 793/B , Variant 2 , and QX in the backyard flocks and performed phylogenetic studies on them. The phylogenetic study revealed that the detected genotypes had high homology with IBV strains that were infected broilers , pullets , and layers in Iran. There is a need for continuous monitoring of IBV among avian species to complete the epidemiological map and work on the pathogenesis of Iranian IBV strains in Iranian backyard chickens.
