 Although anti-endocrine therapies have significantly advanced the treatment of breast cancer , they pose the problem of acquired drug resistance. The oestrogen receptor ( ER)- expressing breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47D alongside their in vitro derived resistant counterparts MCF-7-TR ( tamoxifen-resistant) and T47D-FR ( fulvestrant-resistant) showed dual resistance to fulvestrant and tamoxifen in the presence of upregulated HER1 and HER2 growth factor receptors. Our study demonstrated that tamoxifen resistance and fulvestrant resistance are associated with collateral sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs) lapatinib (
