 Behavioral comorbidities ( depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , fatigue<symptom> , cognitive disturbances , and neuropathic pain) are prevalent in cancer patients and survivors. These mental and neurological health issues reduce quality-of-life , which is a significant societal concern given the increasing rates of long-term survival after various cancers. Hypothesized causes of behavioral comorbidities with cancer include tumor biology , stress associated with the cancer experience , and cancer treatments. A relatively recent leading mechanism by which these causes contribute to changes in neurobiology that underlie behavior is inflammation<symptom>. Indeed , both basic and clinical research indicates that peripheral inflammation<symptom> leads to central inflammation<symptom> and behavioral changes in other illness contexts. Given the limitations of assessing neuroimmunology in clinical populations , this review primarily synthesizes evidence of neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory changes due to two components of cancer ( tumor biology and cancer treatments) that are associated with altered affective-like or cognitive behaviors in rodents. Specifically , alterations in microglia , neuroinflammation , and immune trafficking to the brain are compiled in models of tumors , chemotherapy , and/or radiation. Evidence-based neuronal mechanisms by which these neuroimmune changes may lead to changes in behavior are proposed. Finally , converging evidence in clinical cancer populations is discussed.
