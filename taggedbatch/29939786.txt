 Autophagy of mitochondria ( mitophagy) is essential for maintaining muscle mass and healthy skeletal muscle. Patients with heritable phosphatidic acid phosphatase lipin-1-null mutations present with severe rhabdomyolysis and muscle atrophy in glycolytic muscle fibers , which are accompanied with mitochondrial aggregates and reduced mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity. However , the underlying mechanisms leading to muscle atrophy as a result of lipin-1 deficiency are still not clear. In this study , we found that lipin-1 deficiency in mice is associated with a marked accumulation of abnormal mitochondria and autophagic vacuoles in glycolytic muscle fibers. Our studies using lipin-1-deficient myoblasts suggest that lipin-1 participates in B-cell leukemia<disease> ( BCL) -2 adenovirus<pathogen> E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 ( Bnip3)- regulated mitophagy by interacting with microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain ( LC) 3 , which is an important step in the recruitment of mitochondria to nascent autophagosomes. The requirement of lipin-1 for Bnip3-mediated mitophagy was further verified in vivo in lipin-1-deficient green fluorescent protein-LC3 transgenic mice ( lipin-1
