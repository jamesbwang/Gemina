 Percutaneous treatment of atrioventricular ( AV) valve disease has long been restricted to therapy of mitral stenosis , and was only lately expanded to mitral regurgitation. 15 years ago the MitraClip edge to edge repair was first applied to human pathology. In Europe , German centers were the first to widely adopt this technique in patients with mitral regurgitation and high or inappropriate risk for surgery. Given the exponential rise in implantation procedures , expertise of the operators and investigator initiated investigations substantially contributed to improvements in procedural processes and patient selection. Meanwhile , additional techniques to repair the mitral and tricuspid valve were introduced to German interventionalists , both reconstructive techniques as well as first experiences with transcatheter implantation of mitral valve bioprostheses. Of note , specialized Heart Valve referral Centers catalyzed the adoption of these techniques. This review summarizes the contributions of German Heart Centers to recent developments in percutaneous therapy of AV valve disease.
