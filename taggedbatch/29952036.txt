 Titanium based coordination cages could be interesting for both supramolecular and photophysical chemistry. Herein we report an unprecedented host-guest system , ( Ti ( H2O) 6) @Ti8L12 , which is comprised of the first Ti based coordination cube and the unusual titanium aquo species. Due to the abundant intra-cube O-H... O hydrogen bonds , such ( Ti ( H2O) 6) @Ti8L12 complex is rather stable both in solid and solution states , confirmed by X-ray diffraction and ESI-MS analysis. The encapsulated ( Ti ( H2O) 6) species shows influence on the light absorption , photoluminescent and photocurrent properties. Moreover , ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy has been applied to study the photodynamics of both free and ( Ti ( H2O) 6) guest encapsulated Ti8L12 cube , confirming that the host-guest system produces slightly longer lived excited state. Therefore , this work presents the first ( Ti8L12) cube with unusual ( Ti ( H2O) 6) guest and also provides an interesting supramolecular model for the host-guest photophysical study.
