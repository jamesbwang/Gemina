 Glutathione S-transferase A1 ( GSTA1) is a phase II detoxification enzyme and serves a crucial role in anti-cancer drug resistance. In our previous study , GSTA1 was identified to be highly expressed in various subtypes of non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines compared with human embryonic lung fibroblast cell line MRC-5. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of GSTA1 expression on the proliferation and apoptosis of A549 cells. GSTA1 expression was knocked down or with overexpressed using lentivirus particles. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR) were used to assess the protein , and mRNA levels of GSTA1 in A549 cells , respectively. The effect of GSTA1 manipulation on cell proliferation and apoptosis were investigated
