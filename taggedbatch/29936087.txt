 The present work aims at improving stability of paclitaxel ( PTX) loaded liposomes by its coating with silica on the surface by a modified sol-gel method. Effect of various components of liposomes such as phosphatidylcholine to cholesterol ratio ( PC: CH) , PTX and stearylamine on entrapment efficiency ( % EE) and particle size were systematically investigated and optimized using central composite design on Design-Expert ®. The optimized liposomes were utilized as a template for silica coating to prepare surface coated PTX liposils. Physical stability of liposomes and liposils was evaluated with Triton X-100 and the results indicated that liposils were much more stable as compared to liposomes and the same has been reiterated in stability study performed over 6 months. In vitro cytotoxicity study on B16F10 tumor cells showed cytotoxicity of PTX liposils was not significantly different than PTX liposomes , whereas both were less cytotoxic as compared to the commercial Taxol ®. In vivo pharmacokinetics on rats , exhibited increased T
