 A number of performance-enhancing drugs ( PEDs) are used illicitly to improve muscle strength by the bodybuilders. The misuse of these drugs is associated with serious adverse effects to different organs. A previously healthy 22-year-old male bodybuilder after taking stanozolol , clenbuterol , and triiodothyronine for 10 days presented to the hospital with symptoms of icteric sclera<symptom> , progressive<symptom> dyspnea<symptom> , intermittent cough<symptom> , and bloody<symptom> sputum<symptom>. He was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and acute<symptom> hepatic injury. Rapidly progressive dilated cardiomyopathy and acute<symptom> hepatic injury among bodybuilders in such a short period of time have not been reported. People using these drugs must monitor liver and cardiac functions regularly , and they should discontinue using PEDs after diagnosis of liver or cardiac abnormalities. Physicians should always consider the possibility of the PED abuse in the context of a young athlete suffering cardiomyopathy or hepatic injury.
