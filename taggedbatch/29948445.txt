 Acute kidney injury ( AKI) requiring continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT) is the most severe form of AKI associated with poor short- and long-term patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the variables associated with long-term patient survival in our clinic. This was a single-center retrospective study with AKI survivors who received CRRT from March 2011 to February 2015. During the study period , all consecutive AKI survivors who underwent CRRT were included. Patients on maintenance dialysis prior to CRRT were excluded. Data were collected by reviewing the patients ' medical charts. Long-term follow-up data were gathered through February 2018. A total of 430 patients were included , and 62.8 % of the patients were male. The mean age of the patients was 63.4 ± 14.6 years. The mean serum creatinine level at the time of CRRT initiation was 3.5 ± 2.5 mg/dL. At the time of discharge , the mean eGFR and serum creatinine levels were 58.4 ± 46.7 and 1.7 ± 1.6 mg/dL , respectively. After 3 years , 44.9 % of the patients had survived. When we investigated the factors associated with long-term patient mortality , a longer stay in the ICU ( OR 1.034 ( 1.016-1.053) , p < 0.001) , a history of cancer ( OR 3.830 ( 1.037-3.308) , p = 0.037) , a prolonged prothrombin time ( OR 1.852 ( 1.037-3.308) , p = 0.037) and a lower eGFR at the time of discharge ( OR 0.988 ( 0.982-0.995) , p = 0.001) were independently associated with long-term patient mortality. Our study demonstrates that long-term mortality after CRRT is associated with longer ICU stays and lower eGFRs at the time of hospital discharge. Our data imply the importance of renal recovery for long-term survival of AKI patients treated with CRRT.
