 In the field of kinase inhibitors for applications in cancer research , tubulin is emerging as a targeted cellular protein that can significantly contribute to their activities. However , investigation of kinase inhibitors beyond the kinome is an area often neglected. Herein , we describe the results of pharmacological studies using drugs targeting kinases , tubulin or both. A key finding is that if cells are treated with a kinase inhibitor unintentionally targeting tubulin , their characteristic shape will diminish within a short timeframe. These changes in cell morphology are not seen when cells are treated with bona fide kinase inhibitors that do not directly target tubulin. Thus , early changes in cell morphology upon treatments are a strong indication that the inhibitor is directly targeting tubulin. Recognizing tubulin as a target of kinase inhibitors will build confidence in the future mechanistic studies using kinase inhibitors.
