 Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy ( NIR-PIT) is a new cancer phototherapy modality using an antibody conjugated to a photosensitizer , IRDye700DX. When the conjugate binds to the plasma membrane and is exposed to NIR light , NIR-PIT-treated cells undergo swelling , and target-selective necrotic/immunogenic cell death is induced. However , the cytotoxic mechanism of NIR-PIT has not been elucidated. In order to understand the mechanism , it is important to elucidate how the damage to the plasma membrane induced by NIR light irradiation changes over time. Thus , in the present study , we investigated the changes in plasma membrane permeability using ions and molecules of various sizes. Na
