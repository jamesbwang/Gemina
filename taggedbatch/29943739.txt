 Ureterocolic fistulae<disease> are a rare phenomenon and are most commonly seen secondary to obstructive ureteric calculi. These are usually diagnosed on barium enema or intravenous urography. Most of the times , more than one investigation is needed to confirm the findings. We present a case of iatrogenically-induced ureterocolic fistula<disease> , diagnosed on renogram and direct radionuclide cystography. This case showcases the possibility of using a renogram study as a diagnostic tool for a suspected ureterocolic fistula<disease>. A renogram study also enables to asess the renal function , which is essential in deciding the management.
