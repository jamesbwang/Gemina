 Neuroblastoma is a pediatric tumor of the sympatoadrenal lineage of the neural crest characterized by high molecular and clinical heterogeneity , which are the main causes of the poor<symptom> response<symptom> to standard multimodal therapy. The identification of new and selective biomarkers is important to improve our knowledge on the mechanisms of neuroblastoma progression and to find the targets for innovative cancer therapies. This study identifies a positive correlation among tropomodulins ( TMODs) proteins expression and neuroblastoma progression. TMODs bind the pointed end of actin filaments , regulate polymerization and depolymerization processes modifying actin cytoskeletal dynamic and influencing neuronal development processes. Expression levels of TMODs genes were analyzed in 17 datasets comprising different types of tumors , including neuroblastoma , and it was demonstrated that high levels of tropomodulin1 (
