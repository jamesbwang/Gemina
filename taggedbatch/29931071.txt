 When treating burn injuries , to date , there still remains significant disagreement whether presence of hypothermia<symptom> ( HT) on burn centers ' intensive care unit ( BICU) admission improves or worsens outcomes. The presented single burn center experiences set out to further evaluate the incidence , cause , and potential effects of HT on outcomes in severely burned patients. Between January 2015 and February 2017 , 142 severely burned patients were admitted to a BICU. Temperature at BICU admission of < 36.0 °C was defined as HT and ≥ 36.0 °C as normothermia ( NT). The cases were divided into two groups: HT vs NT. Fifty-four patients met inclusion criteria and were analyzed retrospectively regarding encountered complications , time of hospitalization , and overall survival. The overall incidence of HT on arrival was 62.9 %. Mean duration from burn accident to BICU admission did not differ significantly , but the groups showed significant differences regarding total body surface area ( TBSA; P < .05). Both groups showed a similar distribution , regarding number of surgeries , duration until first burn excision , length of ventilation , and mortality rate of patients ( P > .05). However , time until death was significantly shorter in the HT group. HT at admission remains a common problem following burn injury. Main risk factors include inappropriate temperature management after injury and during transport , extent of TBSA burn , and quantity of resuscitation. Given the high incidence , the involved health care and , especially , also prehospital providers should be further educated about existing recommendations and guidelines to prevent HT.
