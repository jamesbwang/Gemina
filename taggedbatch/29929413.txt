 Based on exceptional advantages of aptamers , increasing attention has been presented in the utilise of them as targeted ligands for cancer drug delivery. Recently , the progress of aptamer-targeted nanoparticles has presented new therapeutic systems for several types of cancer with decreased toxicity and improved efficacy. We highlight some of the promising formulations of aptamer-conjugated polymeric nanoparticles for specific targeted drug delivery to cancer cells. This review paper focuses on the current progresses in the use of the novel strategies to aptamer-targeted drug delivery for chemotherapy. An extensive literature review was performed using internet database , mainly PubMed based on MeSH keywords. The searches included full-text publications written in English without any limitation in date. The abstracts , reviews , books as well as studies without obvious relating of aptamers as targeted ligands for cancer drug delivery were excluded from the study. The reviewed literature revealed that aptamers with ability to modify and conjugate to various molecules can be used as targeted cancer therapy agents. However , development of aptamers unique to each individual 's tumour to the development of personalised medicine seems to be needed.
