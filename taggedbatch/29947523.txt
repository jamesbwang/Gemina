 Unprotected Î±-amino carbon radicals are produced as novel intermediates via a transformation that merges acid-promoted N-H imine generation and chemoselective photocatalytic single-electron reduction. Coupling ammonia<pathogen> and aldehydes/ketones allows the generation of primary amines under mild conditions without the need for protecting groups. The key intermediate can be efficiently transformed into primary ( di) amines by a formal dimerization , reductive amination via hydrogen atom transfer , and arylation through radical-radical coupling.
