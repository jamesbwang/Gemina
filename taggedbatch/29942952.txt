 Na0 .5 Ni0 .25 Mn0 .75 O2 ( NNMO) micro-sheets are novel and attractive cathode materials for Na-ion batteries because of the high capacity and a considerable operating voltage of 3.8 V versus Na/Na + , while the rate and cycling capabilities were not satisfactory. In this paper , AlF3 and Al2O3 were employed as surface modifying materials to enhance the electrochemical performance of NNMO micro-sheets by a simple wet chemical process. XRD , SEM and TEM analyses indicated that the AlF3 layer was amorphous and evenly coated on the surface of NNMO , while the Al2O3 layer was attached to the NNMO surface with the morphology of nanoparticles. Different coating modes led to different electrochemical results. AlF3 coated NNMO ( NNMO@AlF3) delivered a better rate and cycling performance than the pristine NNMO , while the Al2O3 coated NNMO ( NNMO@Al2O3) could not. The NNMO@AlF3 exhibited a 1C discharge capacity of 108 mA h g-1 and 0.2 C capacity retention of 80 % up to 100 cycles with the almost invariable high potential. The electrochemistry impedance spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that the AlF3 coated NNMO had the best structure stability and fastest Na-intercalation kinetics.
