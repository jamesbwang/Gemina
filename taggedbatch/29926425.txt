 Four and a half LIM domain ( FHL) protein family members , FHL1 and FHL2 , are multifunctional proteins that are enriched in cardiac muscle. Although they both localize within the cardiomyocyte sarcomere ( titin N2B) , they have been shown to have important yet unique functions within the context of cardiac hypertrophy and disease. Studies in FHL1-deficient mice have primarily uncovered mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) scaffolding functions for FHL1 as part of a novel biomechanical stretch sensor within the cardiomyocyte sarcomere , which acts as a positive regulator of pressure overload-mediated cardiac hypertrophy. New data have highlighted a novel role for the serine/threonine protein phosphatase ( PP5) as a deactivator of the FHL1-based biomechanical stretch sensor , which has implications in not only cardiac hypertrophy but also heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. In contrast , studies in FHL2-deficient mice have primarily uncovered an opposing role for FHL2 as a negative regulator of adrenergic-mediated signaling and cardiac hypertrophy , further suggesting unique functions targeted by FHL proteins in the `` stressed '' cardiomyocyte. In this review , we provide current knowledge of the role of FHL1 and FHL2 in cardiac muscle as it relates to their actions in cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy. A specific focus will be to dissect the pathways and protein-protein interactions that underlie FHLs ' signaling role in cardiac hypertrophy as well as provide a comprehensive list of FHL mutations linked to cardiac disease , using evidence gained from genetic mouse models and human genetic studies.
