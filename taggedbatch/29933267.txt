 Complication rates after hepatic resection can be affected by management decisions of the hospital care team and/or disparities in care. This is true in many other surgical populations , but little study has been done regarding patients undergoing hepatectomy. Data from the claims-based national Premier Perspective database were used for 2006 to 2014. The analytical sample consisted of adults undergoing partial hepatectomy and total hepatic lobectomy with anesthesia care consisting of general anesthesia ( GA) only or neuraxial and GA ( n = 9442). The key independent variable was type of anesthesia that was categorized as GA versus GA + neuraxial. The outcomes examined were clinical complications and health care resource utilization. Unadjusted bivariate and adjusted multivariate analyses were conducted to examine the effects of the different types of anesthesia on clinical complications and health care resource utilization after controlling for patient- and hospital-level characteristics. Approximately 9 % of patients were provided with GA + neuraxial anesthesia during hepatic resection. In multivariate analyses , no association was observed between types of anesthesia and clinical complications and/or health care utilization ( eg , admission to intensive care unit). However , patients who received blood transfusions were significantly more likely to have complications and intensive care unit stays. In addition , certain disparities of care , including having surgery in a rural hospital , were associated with poorer outcomes. Neuraxial anesthesia utilization was not associated with improvement in clinical outcome or cost among patients undergoing hepatic resections when compared to patients receiving GA alone. Future research may focus on prospective data sources with more clinical information on such patients and examine the effects of GA + neuraxial anesthesia on various complications and health care resource utilization.
