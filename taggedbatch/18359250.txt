 Turbellarian species can post-embryonically produce germ line cells from pluripotent stem cells called neoblasts , which enables some of them to switch between an asexual and a sexual state in response to environmental changes. Certain low-molecular-weight compounds contained in sexually mature animals act as sex-inducing substances that trigger post-embryonic germ cell development in asexual worms of the freshwater planarian Our assay system based on feeding sex-inducing substances to asexual worms of Our results suggest that within Tricladida , there are one or more common compounds or functional analogs capable of fully sexualizing asexual worms of
