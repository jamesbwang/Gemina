 Recent rat studies show different tissue distributions of vitamin B12 ( B12) , administered orally as hydroxo-B12 ( HO-B12) ( predominant in food) and cyano-B12 ( CN-B12) ( common in supplements). Here we examine male Wistar rats kept on a low-B12 diet for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week period on diets with HO-B12 ( n 9) or CN-B12 ( n 9) , or maintained on a low-B12 diet ( n 9). Plasma B12 was analysed before , during and after the study. The content of B12 and its variants ( HO-B12 , glutathionyl-B12 , CN-B12 , 5 '- deoxyadenosyl-B12 ( ADO-B12) , and methyl-B12 ( CH3-B12)) were assessed in the tissues at the end of the study. A period of 4 weeks on the low-B12 diet reduced plasma B12 by 58 % ( from median 1323 ( range 602-1791) to 562 ( range 267-865) pmol/l , n 27). After 2 weeks on a high-B12 diet ( week 6 v. week 4) , plasma B12 increased by 68 % ( HO-B12) and 131 % ( CN-B12). Total B12 in the tissues accumulated differently: HO-B12 > CN-B12 ( liver , spleen) , HO-B12 < CN-B12 ( kidneys) , and HO-B12 â‰ˆ CN-B12 ( brain , heart). Notably , more than half of the administered CN-B12 remained in this form in the kidneys , whereas HO-B12 was largely converted to the bioactive ADO-B12. Only < 10 % of the other cofactor , CH3-B12 , were found in the tissues. In conclusion , dietary CN-B12 caused a higher increase in plasma and total kidney B12 but provided less than half of the active coenzymes in comparison to dietary HO-B12. These data argue that HO-B12 may provide a better tissue supply of B12 than CN-B12 , thereby underscoring the lack of a direct relation between plasma B12 and tissue B12.
