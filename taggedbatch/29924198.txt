 A 44-year-old man was referred for evaluation of pain and temporal floaters after receiving a rebounded bullet impact to his right eye. Typical funduscopic findings , together with the confirmed presence of an intraorbital metallic foreign body , led to the diagnosis of chorioretinitis sclopetaria. Conservative management was performed as no severe<symptom> symptoms<symptom> were observed. The favorable clinical outcome was confirmed in subsequent reviews. Chorioretinitis sclopetaria is characterized by a proliferative chorioretinal inflammation<symptom> as a consequence of the expansive wave caused by the entrance of a bullet between the eyeball and the orbit.
