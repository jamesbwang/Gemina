 To evaluate the relationship between smoking and both antithyroperoxidase antibody ( TPOAb) and antithyroglobulin antibody ( TgAb) positivity in subjects from Panshan , Zhangwu , and Huanghua with mildly deficient , more than adequate , and excessive iodine intake , respectively. Smoking-related data were collected by questionnaire , and laboratory measurements of TPOAb , TgAb , and thyrotropin ( TSH) were determined at baseline and follow-up. ( 1) A 1.48-fold increased risk of TPOAb positivity was found in smokers than in non-smokers after adjusting for confounders ( age , sex , and areas) ( OR ( 95 % CI) = 1.48 ( 1.12-1.95) , p = 0.01). ( 2) Among female subjects , the prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies in smokers was increased than that in non-smokers in Panshan , Zhangwu , and Huanghua ( TPOAb): 16.79 vs. 8.89 % , 14.14 vs. 11.09 % , 19.53 vs. 9.57 %; TgAb 15.32 vs. 9.29 % , 12.79 vs. 11.94 % , 17.19 vs. 10.55 % , respectively). The difference was significant in Panshan after adjusting for age. ( 3) Female long-term smokers ( > 20 years) had an increased frequency of thyroid autoantibody positivity than non-smokers after adjusting for confounders ( TPOAb OR ( 95 % CI) = 1.60 ( 1.10-2.34); TgAb OR ( 95 % CI) = 1.31 ( 0.88-1.94)). ( 4) There was no difference in the incidence of thyroid autoantibodies among non-smokers , new smokers , and long-term smokers at follow-up. ( 5) TSH was greater in TPOAb-positive subjects than in seronegative smokers ( 1.56 vs. 1.20 mU/L , p < 0.001) and non-smokers ( 1.97 vs. 1.58 mU/L , p < 0.001). However , TSH was also greater in non-smokers than in smokers , regardless of whether subjects were positive ( 1.97 vs. 1.56 mU/L , p = 0.04) or negative ( 1.58 vs. 1.20 mU/L , p < 0.001) for TPOAb. Long-term smoking could increase the prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies in a population with mildly deficient iodine intake. TSH levels were lesser in smokers than in non-smokers and greater in subjects with thyroid autoantibody positivity than in seronegative subjects. The influence of smoking on TSH levels was independent of thyroid autoantibody levels.
