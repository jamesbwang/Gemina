 Sensitive , probe-based detection of multiple DNA targets is limited by the competitive reannealing of the antiparallel duplex DNA helix with the complementary DNA strand. To address this , we developed Cliffhanger primers , which create single-stranded DNA overhangs on PCR amplicons while simultaneously increasing the multiplex PCR efficacy and allowing PCR amplification using crude lysates of human faecal samples. A multiplex PCR that targeted eight genes from diarrhoeagenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> plus an internal control was performed and compared to a routine method that consisted of culture followed by multiplex PCR with fragment length separation. A total of 2515 clinical<disease> faecal samples from patients with diarrhoea<disease> were tested using both methods , and there was a significant increase in clinical sensitivity and negative predictive value with the Cliffhanger method for seven out of eight genes. All Cliffhanger-only positive samples were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR amplicon. Notably , the Cliffhanger method reduced the total sample turn-around time in the laboratory from 20 hours to 6 hours. Hence , use of Cliffhanger primers increased assay robustness , decreased turn-around time and increased PCR efficacy. This increased the overall clinical sensitivity without the loss of specificity for a heavily multiplexed PCR assay.
