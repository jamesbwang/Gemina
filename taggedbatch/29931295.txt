 Non-ampullary duodenal adenocarcinoma , excluding carcinoma in the ampulla of Vater , is a rare disease. Although several prognostic factors have been reported , they remain controversial due to the rarity of non-ampullary duodenal adenocarcinoma. The aims of this study were to investigate prognostic factors in patients with non-ampullary duodenal adenocarcinoma and to assess chemotherapy in patients with recurrence. Records of 25 patients who underwent surgical treatment for non-ampullary duodenal adenocarcinoma from 2004 to 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The relationship between the clinicopathological factors and outcomes was investigated. Serum level of CA19-9 , gross appearance , tumor size , tumor invasion , lymph node metastases , TNM stage and lymphatic and vascular invasion were significant risk factors of recurrence. Patients with recurrence who received chemotherapy according to regimens used to treat colorectal cancer had a better prognosis than those without chemotherapy ( P = 0.016). Advanced non-ampullary duodenal adenocarcinoma has a poor prognosis , but chemotherapy possibly improves the prognosis in the patients with recurrent non-ampullary duodenal adenocarcinoma.
