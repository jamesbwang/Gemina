 Neuroblastoma is one of the most commonly found solid tumors in children. The monoclonal antibody dinutuximab ( DNX) targets the sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipid GD2 expressed on almost all neuroblastoma tumor cells and induces cell lysis. However , the expression of GD2 is not limited to tumor cells only , but is also present on central nerve tissue and peripheral nerve cells explaining dinutuximab toxicity. The most common adverse reactions are pain and discomfort , which may lead to discontinuation of the treatment. Furthermore , there is little to no data available on exposure and effect relationships of dinutuximab. We , therefore , developed an easy method in order to quantify dinutuximab levels in human plasma. Ammonium sulfate ( AS) was used to precipitate all immunoglobulins ( IgGs) in human plasma. After centrifugation , supernatant containing albumin was decanted and the precipitated IgG fraction was re-dissolved in a buffer containing 0.5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS). Samples were then reduced , alkylated , and digested with trypsin. Finally , a signature peptide in complementarity determining region 1 of DNX heavy chain was quantified on LC-MS/MS using a stable isotopically labeled peptide as internal standard. AS purification efficiently removed 97.5 % of the albumin fraction in the supernatant layer. The validation performed on DNX showed that within-run and between-run coefficients of variation ( CV) for lower limit of quantification ( LLOQ) were 5.5 and 1.4 % , respectively. The overall CVs for quality control ( QC) low , QC med , and QC high levels were < 5 %. Linearity in the range 1-32 mg/L was excellent ( r
