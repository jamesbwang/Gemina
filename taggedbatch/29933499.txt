 PB1F2 is a proapoptotic protein encoded by an alternative reading frame in the influenza<pathogen><disease> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen>. Its accumulation accelerates mitochondrial fragmentation by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential following translocation into the mitochondrial inner membrane space , but the mechanistic underpinnings remain unclear. Herein , the PB1F2 from HK97 was expressed and purified in soluble form. The interaction between PB1F2 and the mitochondrial membrane were investigated using three membrane mimics , liposomes , bicelles , and nanodiscs. We show that the interactions between PB1F2 and membrane mimics depend on lipid type and are time- and dose-dependent. The primary membrane target of PB1F2 is phosphatidylcholine , the lipid that forms the major component of mitochondrial inner membranes<symptom>. PB1F2 disrupts the integrity of lipid membranes<symptom> by forming micelle-like PB1F2-lipid assemblies.
