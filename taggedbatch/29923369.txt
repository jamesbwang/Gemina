 In this article , the photo-deactivation mechanism of dual emission of a neutral iridium ( III) complex<pathogen> is explored by using density function theory ( DFT) and time-dependent density function theory ( TD-DFT) calculations. To explore the phosphorescence quantum yield of the iridium ( III) complex<pathogen> , the radiative decay constant of each emission excited state was computed by TD-DFT calculations , including spin-orbit coupling ( SOC). In these calculations , factors such as the transition dipole moments , energy gaps , and SOC elements between the emission states and singlet excited states are taken into account in the evaluation of the radiative decay constants. Additionally , the non-radiative decay is revealed by considering the temperature-independent and the temperature-dependent non-radiative processes. The computational results indicate that the order of the two emission excited states can exert a significant effect on the phosphorescence quantum yield , which is beneficial for understanding the properties of photo-deactivation of phosphorescent emitters.
