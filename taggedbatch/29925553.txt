 A 22-year-old woman presented with worsening vision loss<symptom> and headaches<symptom>. A diagnosis of acromegaly was confirmed after detection of an invasive pituitary macroadenoma and biochemical testing. Despite two attempts of surgical debulking of the tumour and administration of long-acting octreotide and cabergoline , growth hormone ( GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1) levels were uncontrolled. The patient experienced persistent headaches<symptom> despite surgery , gamma knife radiation and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement; she was then enrolled in the ACCESS trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier , NCT01995734). Pasireotide ( Signifor; Signifor LAR) was initiated , which led to reduced GH and IGF-1 levels and resolution of her intractable headaches<symptom>. This highlights the use of monthly pasireotide in resolving headaches<symptom> and improved biochemical control in a patient with acromegaly. We postulate that the headaches<symptom> improved due to an analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory effect mediated by somatostatin receptors targeted by pasireotide. This may represent an additional benefit of pasireotide and requires further investigation.
