 We hypothesised that a femoral array placed into bone or an external ( pinless) reference marker made no difference to leg length discrepancy in patients undergoing navigated total hip arthroplasty. Consecutive patients undergoing navigated total hip arthroplasty. 162 patients. No statistical difference between preoperative leg length discrepancy ( p = 0.524). Mean intraoperative change was 3.7 mm and 4.6 mm ( p = 0.262). The mean change in leg length measure post operatively was 4.2 mm and 4.1 mm ( p = 0.656). No significant difference in leg length discrepancy between a pinless reference markers and a femoral array placed into the bone.
