 We aimed to investigate the long-term effects of atomoxetine on growth in Korean children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD). The medical records of 82 subjects ( mean age , 9.0 ± 2.0 years; 64 boys) with ADHD treated with atomoxetine for at least 1 year at the Department of Psychiatry at Asan Medical Center were retrospectively reviewed. Height and weight data were prospectively obtained and retrospectively gathered and converted to age- and gender-corrected z scores using norms from Korean youths. Growth changes were analyzed using random coefficients models with changes in height or weight z scores as the dependent variables. Height z scores significantly decreased during the treatment period ( β = -0.054 , p = 0.024). Height z scores decreased during the 1st year of treatment ( β = -0.086 , p = 0.003) , but did not change after the 1st year. Weight z scores did not change significantly during treatment ( β = 0.004 , p = 0.925). Our results suggest that long-term atomoxetine treatment may be associated with deficits in height growth in Korean youths , although this effect was minor and tended to be attenuated over the first year. Because of the limitations of this study such as retrospective design and selection bias , further prospective studies are needed.
