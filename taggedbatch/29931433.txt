 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC) is one of common cancers worldwide. Positron emission tomography ( PET) with 2-deoxy-2- ( Overall , 22 patients , mean age , 55.2 ± 11.0 years , with different HNSCC were acquired. Low grade ( G1/2) tumors were diagnosed in 10 cases ( 45 %) and high grade ( G3) tumor in 12 ( 55 %) patients. In all cases , whole body PET was performed. For this study , the following specimen stainings were performed: MIB-1 staining ( KI 67 expression) , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) , tumor suppressor protein p53 , hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF) -1 α , and human papilloma virus ( p16 expression). All stained specimens were digitalized and analyzed by using the ImageJ software 1.48 v. Spearman 's correlation coefficient ( ρ) was used to analyze associations between investigated parameters. P values < 0.05 were taken to indicate statistical significance. P16-negative tumors showed statistically significant higher SUV Associations between (
