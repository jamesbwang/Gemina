 Clinically approved cancer therapies include small molecules , antibodies , and nanoparticles. There has been major progress in the treatment of several cancer types over recent decades. However , many challenges remain for optimal use of conventional and nanoparticle-based therapies in oncology including poor drug delivery , rapid clearance , and drug resistance. The antimalarial agent chloroquine has been found to mitigate some of these challenges by modulating cancer cells and the tissue microenvironment. Particularly , chloroquine was recently found to reduce immunological clearance of nanoparticles by resident macrophages in the liver , leading to increased tumor accumulation of nanodrugs. Additionally , chloroquine has been shown to improve drug delivery and efficacy through normalization of tumor vasculature and suppression of several oncogenic and stress-tolerance pathways , such as autophagy , that protect cancer cells from cytotoxic agents. This review will discuss the use of chloroquine as combination therapy to improve cancer treatment.
