 To develop a predictive nomogram for chronic kidney disease-free survival probability in the long term after partial nephrectomy. A retrospective analysis was carried out of 698 patients with T1 renal tumors undergoing partial nephrectomy at a tertiary academic institution. A multivariable Cox regression analysis was carried out based on parameters proven to have an impact on postoperative renal function. Patients with incomplete data , < 12 months follow up and preoperative chronic kidney disease stage III or greater were excluded. The study end-points were to identify independent risk factors for new-onset chronic kidney disease development , as well as to construct a predictive model for chronic kidney disease-free survival probability after partial nephrectomy. The median age was 52 years , median tumor size was 2.5 cm and mean warm ischemia time was 28 min. A total of 91 patients ( 13.1 %) developed new-onset chronic kidney disease at a median follow up of 60 months. The chronic kidney disease-free survival rates at 1 , 3 , 5 and 10 year were 97.1 % , 94.4 % , 85.3 % and 70.6 % , respectively. On multivariable Cox regression analysis , age ( 1.041 , P = 0.001) , male sex ( hazard ratio 1.653 , P < 0.001) , diabetes mellitus ( hazard ratio 1.921 , P = 0.046) , tumor size ( hazard ratio 1.331 , P < 0.001) and preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate ( hazard ratio 0.937 , P < 0.001) were independent predictors for new-onset chronic kidney disease. The C-index for chronic kidney disease-free survival was 0.853 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.815-0.895). We developed a novel nomogram for predicting the 5-year chronic kidney disease-free survival probability after on-clamp partial nephrectomy. This model might have an important role in partial nephrectomy decision-making and follow-up plan after surgery. External validation of our nomogram in a larger cohort of patients should be considered.
