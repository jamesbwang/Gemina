 Primary Sjögren syndrome<disease><symptom> ( pS) is associated with autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor ( RF) and anti-nuclear antibodies such as anti-Ro ( SS-A) and/or La ( SS-B). Recent developments within autoimmune diagnostics allow quantitation of RF subclasses and anti-Ro epitopes. Will this refinement by autoimmune diagnostics help predicting development of extraglandular manifestations ( EGM) in pS patients? A cohort of pS and rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> ( RA) patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca<pathogen> ( n = 35 and 16 , resp) was included. Of the pS patients , 54 % developed one or more EGM. Antibodies quantitated were IgM-RF , IgA-RF , IgG-RF , anti-Ro52 , and anti-Ro60. Upon analysis of RF isotypes , pS patients generally displayed higher IgA-RF concentrations than RA patients ( 126 versus 49 U/ml , p = 0.015) , while the dominant RF isotype in RA patients was IgM-RF ( 82.5 versus 38 U/ml , p = 0.012). No differences were observed regarding IgG-RF concentrations. In pS without/with EGM , the median RF IgM concentrations were similar , while RF IgA and IgG concentrations tended to be lower in pS patients with EGM > 1. Both Ro epitopes were strongly recognized by almost all pS patients , independent from EGM , while these antibodies were absent in RA patients. Primary Sjögren syndrome<disease><symptom> and RA patients have distinct serological profiles when analysing RF and Ro-specific antibodies. A longitudinal study of switched RF isotypes in pS patients is worthwhile from an immunological point of view , but its value is limited regarding identification of pS patients prone to developing EGM or RA patients prone to developing secondary sicca<pathogen> symptoms.
