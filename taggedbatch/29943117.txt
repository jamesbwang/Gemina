 In the evolving field of transcatheter aortic valve implantations ( TAVI) we aimed to gain insight into trends in patient and procedural characteristics as well as clinical outcome over an 8‑year period in a real-world TAVI population. We performed a single-centre retrospective analysis of 1,011 consecutive patients in a prospectively acquired database. We divided the cohort into tertiles of 337 patients; first interval: January 2009-March 2013 , second interval: March 2013-March 2015 , third interval: March 2015-October 2016. Over time , a clear shift in patient selection was noticeable towards lower surgical risks including Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality score and comorbidity. The frequency of transfemoral TAVI increased ( from 66.5 to 77.4 % , p = 0.0015). Device success improved ( from 62.0 to 91.5 % , p < 0.0001) as did the frequency of symptomatic relief ( ≥ 1 New<pathogen> York Heart Association class difference) ( from 73.8 to 87.1 % , p = 0.00025). Complication rates decreased , including in-hospital stroke ( from 5.0 to 2.1 % , p = 0.033) and pacemaker implantations ( from 10.1 to 5.9 % , p = 0.033). Thirty-day mortality decreased ( from 11.0 to 2.4 % , p < 0.0001); after adjustment for patient characteristics , a mortality-risk reduction of 72 % was observed ( adjusted hazard ratio ( HR): 0.28 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.13-0.62). One-year mortality rates decreased ( from 23.4 to 11.4 %) , but this was no longer significant after a landmark point was set at 30 days ( mortality from 31 days until 1 year) ( adjusted HR: 0.69 , 95 % CI: 0.41-1.16 , p = 0.16). A clear shift towards a lower-risk TAVI population and improved clinical outcome was observed over an 8‑year period. Survival after TAVI improved impressively , mainly as a consequence of decreased 30-day mortality.
