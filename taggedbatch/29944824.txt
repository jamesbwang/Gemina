 High-performance lithium-ion batteries ( LIBs) are in increasing demand for a variety of applications in rapidly growing energy-related fields including electric vehicles. To develop high-performance LIBs , it is necessary to comprehensively understand the degradation mechanism of the LIB electrodes. From this viewpoint , it is crucial to investigate how the electrical properties of LIB electrodes change under charging and discharging. Here , we probe the local electrical properties of LIB electrodes with nanoscale resolution by scanning spreading resistance microscopy ( SSRM). Via quantitative and comparative SSRM measurements on pristine and degraded LIB anodes of Si-C composites blended with graphite ( Gr) particles , the electrical degradation of the LIB anodes is visualized. The electrical conductivity of the Si-C composite particles considerably degraded over 300 cycles of charging and discharging , whereas the Gr particles maintained their conductivity.
