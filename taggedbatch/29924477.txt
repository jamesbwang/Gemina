 In this review , we discuss first the anatomical and lesion<symptom> studies that allowed the localization of fundamental functions in the cerebral cortex of primates including humans. Subsequently , we argue that the years from the end of the Second World War until the end of the last century represented the `` golden age '' of system neuroscience. In this period , the mechanisms-not only the localization-underlying sensory , and in particular visual functions were described , followed by those underlying cognitive functions and housed in temporal , parietal , and premotor areas. At the end of the last century , brain imaging techniques were developed that allowed the assessment of the functions of different cortical areas in a more precise and sophisticated way. However , brain imaging tells little about the neural mechanisms underlying functions. Furthermore , the brain imaging suffers from 3 major problems: time is absent , the data are merely correlative and the testing is often not ecological. We conclude our review discussing the possibility that these pitfalls might be overcome by using intracortical recordings ( eg stereo-EEG) , which have millisecond time resolution , allow direct electrical stimulation of specific sites , and finally enable to study patients while freely moving.
