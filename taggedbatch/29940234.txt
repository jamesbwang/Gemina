 To examine if lower urinary<disease> tract symptom ( LUTS) progression was related to anthropometric and lifestyle factors. The analysis included 5,495 men who participated in the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort ( recruited 1994-1998) and who reported an International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS) < 8 at follow-up 4 ( FUP4 , 2007-2009) , had not reported taking α-adrenoreceptor antagonists or 5-α reductase inhibitors or prostate surgery for BPH/LUTS treatment. LUTS progression was defined as an IPSS ≥ 8 at FUP5 ( 2010-2012). Using logistic regression analysis , education , marital status , satisfaction with life , satisfaction with health , history of diabetes and of hypertension , smoking , alcohol consumption , body mass index ( BMI) , waist circumference , and physical activity were examined as potential LUTS risk factors adjusting for age. Increase in BMI between baseline and FUP4 of ≥ 2 BMI units was related to LUTS progression ( odds ratio ( OR) 1.30 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.08-1.57) compared with stable BMI. Compared to men who were very satisfied with life at baseline , those who were satisfied ( 1.28 , 1.11-1.47) , unsatisfied ( 1.80 , 1.31-2.46) or very unsatisfied with life ( 1.43 , 0.62-3.34) were more likely to report LUTS progression. Men with longer education had higher odds of LUTS progression than men with primary education only ( 1.25 , 1.06-1.48). Adjusting for BMI or lifestyle factors did not attenuate these associations. Smoking habits , alcohol consumption , physical activity , self-reported history of diabetes or hypertension , and marital status were not related with LUTS progression. Our results confirm some , but not all previously observed risk factors for LUTS progression.
