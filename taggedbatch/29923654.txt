 Deletion of Prp4 , the only kinase among spliceosome components , is not lethal in Fusarium<pathogen> graminearum but Fgprp4 mutants have severe growth defects and produced spontaneous suppressors. To identify novel suppressor mutations of Fgprp4 , we sequenced the genome of suppressor S37 that was normal in growth but only partially recovered for intron splicing and identified a tandem duplication of 9-aa in the tri-snRNP component FgSNU66. Among the 19 additional suppressor strains found to have mutations in FgSNU66 ( out of 260 screened) , five had the same 9-aa duplication event with S37 and another five had the R477H/C mutation. The rest had nonsense or G-to-D mutations in the C-terminal 27-aa ( CT27) region of FgSnu66 , which is absent in its yeast ortholog. Truncation of this C-terminal region reduced the interaction of FgSnu66 with FgHub1 but increased its interaction with FgPrp8 and FgPrp6. Five phosphorylation sites were identified in FgSnu66 by phosphoproteomic analysis and the T418A-S420A-S422A mutation was shown to reduce virulence. Overall , our results showed that mutations in FgSNU66 can suppress deletion of Fgprp4 , which has not been reported in other organisms , and the C-terminal tail of FgSnu66 plays a role in its interaction with key tri-snRNP components during spliceosome activation.
