 Although glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate have showed beneficial effects on joint tissues in osteoarthritis ( OA) , their therapeutic use in the clinical setting is still debatable. Hence , a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials was conducted to investigate the efficacy of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate on knee OA symptoms.
