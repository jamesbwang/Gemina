 Mounting evidence has demonstrated the combined effects of ocean acidification ( OA) and other environmental stressors on marine organisms. Although metal pollution is widely distributed in coasts and estuaries , the combined effects of OA and metal pollution have received little attention until recent years. In this study , the accumulation and subcellular distribution of cadmium ( Cd) and the physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> of the oyster Crassostrea gigas were investigated after 31 days of exposure to OA and Cd , either alone or in combination. Increased Cd accumulation was found both in gills ( about 57 % increase at pH 7.8 , 22 % increase at pH 7.6) and digestive glands ( about 38 % increase at pH 7.8 , 22 % increase at pH 7.6) of C. gigas under elevated pCO
