 Forebrain embryonic zinc finger 2 ( Fezf2) is an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger transcription repressor. It has been reported to be a tumor suppressor; however , neither the role that Fezf2 plays in bladder cancer nor the mechanisms involved have been investigated. In this study , we showed that Fezf2 expression is downregulated in bladder cancer tissues and cell lines compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues and normal urothelial cells. We also retrospectively analyzed the association between Fezf2 and various clinicopathologic characteristics in 196 bladder cancer patients , and showed that low expression of Fezf2 is correlated with larger tumor size , advanced tumor stage , and poor clinical prognosis. Moreover , we found that overexpression of Fezf2 significantly inhibited the proliferation , growth , migration , and invasion of bladder cancer cells , and attenuated angiogenesis , while knockdown of Fezf2 had the opposite effect. Fezf2 suppressed bladder cancer aggressiveness by activating the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. These findings suggest that Fezf2 holds promise as a prognostic biomarker , and provide a putative mechanism for bladder cancer progression.
