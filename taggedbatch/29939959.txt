 No randomized controlled trial ( RCT) has investigated the efficacy of hypnosis for reducing pain and improving healing in children with burns. This RCT aimed to investigate whether hypnosis decreases pain , anxiety<symptom> and stress and accelerates wound-healing in children undergoing burn wound<disease><symptom> procedures. Children ( 4 to 16 years) with acute burns presenting for their first dressing change were randomly assigned to a Hypnosis Group who received hypnosis plus standard care or a Standard Care Group who received standard pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention. Repeated measures of pain intensity , anxiety<symptom> , stress , and wound-healing were taken at every dressing change until â‰¥ 95 % wound<disease><symptom> re-epithelialization. Data for 62 children were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis using Generalized Estimating Equations ( n = 35 Standard Care Group; n = 27 Hypnosis Group). An effect on the primary outcomes of pain and wound<disease><symptom> healing was not supported ( self-reported pain intensity largest Mean Difference ( MD) = -0.85 ( 95 % CI: -1.91 , 0.22) , p = 0.12; MD for re-epithelialization = -0.46 ( 95 % CI: -4.27 , 3.35) , p = 0.81). Some support was found for an effect on the secondary outcomes of pre-procedural anxiety<symptom> ( MD = -0.80 ( 95 % CI: -1.50 , -0.10) , p = 0.03 before the second dressing change) and heart rate as a measure of stress ( MD = -15.20 ( -27.20 , -3.20) , p = 0.01) and MD = -15.39 ( -28.25 , -2.53) , p = 0.02 before and after the third dressing change). Hypnosis may be effective for decreasing pre-procedural anxiety<symptom> and heart rate in children undergoing repeated pediatric wound-care procedures but not for reducing pain intensity or accelerating wound<disease><symptom> healing.
