 Self-assembling , semi-flexible polymers are ubiquitous in biology and technology. However , conflicting accounts of the equilibrium kinetics remain for such an important system. Here , by focusing on a dynamical description of a minimal model in an overdamped environment , I identify the correct kinetic scheme that describes the system at equilibrium in the limits of high bonding energy and dilute concentration.
