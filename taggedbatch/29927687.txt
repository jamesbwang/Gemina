 The size distribution of adipocytes in a suspension , after collagenase digestion of adipose tissue , can be determined by computerized image analysis. Free lipid , forming droplets , in such suspensions implicates a bias since droplets present in the images may be identified as adipocytes. This problem is not always adjusted for and some reports state that distinguishing droplets and cells is a considerable problem. In addition , if the droplets originate mainly from rupture of large adipocytes , as often described , this will also bias size analysis. We here confirm that our ordinary manual means of distinguishing droplets and adipocytes in the images ensure correct and rapid identification before exclusion of the droplets. Further , in our suspensions , prepared with focus on gentle handling of tissue and cells , we find no association between the amount of free lipid and mean adipocyte size or proportion of large adipocytes.
