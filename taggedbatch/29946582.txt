 The Ids-Vds properties of a van der Waals cross-junction of few layered MoS2/MoTe2 were investigated , and the physical device parameters were altered in order to transform the conduction mechanism from thermionic emission to interband tunneling. The pristine heterostructure demonstrated rectification behavior of typical p-n junction diodes , because of the p-type and n-type nature of MoTe2 and MoS2 , respectively. Lowering the contact resistance between the metal and channel materials , by changing the electrode metals from Au to Pd and Ti , alone did not give rise to carrier conduction through the hetero-interband tunneling between MoTe2 and MoS2. In addition to the reduction in contact resistance , the chemical doping of MoS2 using Benzyl Viologen ( BV) achieves hetero-interband tunneling between MoTe2 and MoS2 , which probably narrows the depletion layer by degenerating MoS2. The peak-to-valley ratio of the tunneling current of the BV-doped heterostructure of MoS2/MoTe2 is about 4.8 , which is comparable to that of the commercially available Si tunneling diode.
