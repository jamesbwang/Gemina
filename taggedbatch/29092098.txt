 Recently , several studies have reported that dedifferentiation occurs in fatal well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( WDTC) cases. This study aimed at investigating the clinicopathological characteristics of WDTC undergoing dedifferentiation. A total of 63 WDTC patients harboring dedifferentiated phenotype were enrolled in the study. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis were used to perform survival analyses. Harrell index of concordance ( C-index) and Akaike information criterion ( AIC) were calculated to compare the predictive value for prognosis among several prognostic classification systems. The median cause-specific survival ( CSS) of patients was 138 months , with the CSS rate of 64.0 % and 53.3 % at 5 and 10 years , respectively. Presence of the anaplastic thyroid cancer ( ATC) phenotype significantly increased the risk of poor CSS ( The presence of dedifferentiated phenotypes can be responsible for the poor outcomes in WDTC patients. The AGES system demonstrates to be an optimal prognostic system for WDTC undergoing dedifferentiation.
