 Vascular dementia ( VaD) is characteristic of chronic<symptom> brain ischemia and progressive memory decline , which has a high incidence in the elderly. However , there are no effective treatments for VaD , and the underlying mechanism of its pathogenesis remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of a synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 ( WIN) on VaD , and molecular mechanisms of the effects. VaD model was induced by 2-vessel occlusion ( 2VO). Spatial reference learning was evaluated by the Morris water maze , and recognition memory was assessed using the novel object recognition test. Autophagy-related proteins ( microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 ( LC-3) and Beclin-1) were examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Caspase-3 was detected by Western blot. Inflammatory factors , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor alpha ( TNF-α) and interleukin 1 beta ( IL-1β) , were estimated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) and Western blot. VaD increased the levels of LC-3 , Beclin-1 , and inflammatory factors , which were reversed by chronic treatment with WIN. WIN decreased the expression of Capase-3 , and improved the learning and memory<symptom> impairment<symptom> of VaD rats. These data indicate that WIN exerts a neuroprotective effect on the cognitive deficits of VaD rats , which may be associated with the suppression of excessive autophagy and inflammation<symptom>.
