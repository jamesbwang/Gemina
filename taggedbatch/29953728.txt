 Tumor suppressor protein p53 aggregates in the hypoxic core of solid tumors. C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein ( CHIP) displays chaperone as well as E3 ligase activities in both stabilizing and degrading wild-type and mutant p53. In this study , we have discovered that CHIP selectively degrades aggregating mutant p53 under both normal and hypoxic conditions. Silencing of CHIP alleviates degradation of aggregating mutant p53 in both normoxia and hypoxia , but has no significant effect on the level of nonaggregating mutant p53. Although both U-box and TPR domains of CHIP are responsible for p53 degradation , the U-box domain selectively binds to aggregating mutant p53 , whereas the TPR domain interacts with nonaggregating mutant p53. The degradation of mutant p53 by CHIP is shown to be via autophagy through K63-linked polyubiquitination. Both in normoxia and under physiological hypoxia , the level of aggregating mutant p53 in the presence of CHIP was reduced threefold , whereas under serum starvation , it was reduced fivefold. Interestingly , both wild-type and mutant p53 interact with and stabilize CHIP at the post-translational level , suggesting a chaperone synergy between p53 and CHIP. This finding may have strong therapeutic significance via selective degradation of oncogenic mutant p53 in regressing hypoxic tumors.
