 The knowledge gained from starch-nanocomposite-film research has not been fully applied commercially because of the lack of appropriate industrial processing techniques for nanofillers and starch films. Three organically modified montmorillonites ( OMMTs) were prepared using a semidry kneading method. The effects of the OMMTs on the structures and properties of starch nanocomposite films , prepared by extrusion blowing , were investigated. The X-ray diffraction ( XRD) analysis results revealed that the OMMTs with various quaternary ammonium salts possessed differing layer structures and d-space values. The results of the XRD and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR) showed that the starch ⁻ OMMT interaction resulted in a structural change , namely the starch ⁻ OMMT films possessed a balanced exfoliated and intercalated nanostructure , while the starch ⁻ MMT film possessed an exfoliated nanostructure with non-intercalated montmorillonite ( MMT). The results of the solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR) analysis suggested that the starch-OMMT nanocomposite possessed comparatively large quantities of single-helix structures and micro-ordered amorphous regions. The starch ⁻ OMMT films exhibited good tensile strength ( TS) ( maximum of 6.09 MPa) and water barrier properties ( minimum of 3.48 & times; 10
