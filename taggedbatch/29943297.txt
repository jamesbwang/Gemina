 In the proteomic and genomic era , lung cancer researchers are increasingly under challenge with traditional protein analyzing tools. High output , multiplexed analytical procedures are in demand for disclosing the post-translational modification , molecular interactions and signaling pathways of proteins precisely , specifically , dynamically and systematically , as well as for identifying novel proteins and their functions. This could be better realized by single-cell proteomic methods than conventional proteomic methods. Using single-cell proteomic tools including flow cytometry , mass cytometry , microfluidics and chip technologies , chemical cytometry , single-cell western blotting , the quantity and functions of proteins are analyzed simultaneously. Aside from deciphering disease mechanisms , single-cell proteomic techniques facilitate the identification and screening of biomarkers , molecular targets and promising compounds as well. This review summarized single-cell proteomic tools and their use in lung cancer.
