 Owing to a lack of appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for mycotic keratitis<disease><symptom> , approximately one million cases of preventable corneal blindness<symptom> are reported each year. The number of keratitis<disease><symptom> cases due to infection with Fusarium<pathogen> is increasing significantly worldwide , many of which are not treated adequately and in a timely manner due to frequent misdiagnosis. In the current report , we describe three cases of keratitis<disease><symptom> caused by Fusarium<pathogen> solani sensu stricto ( FSSC5) from Turkey and The Netherlands , following ocular trauma. The etiological agent of keratitis<disease><symptom> , FSSC5 , identified by sequencing of the partial tef1-α gene , exhibited low minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs) of 1 µg/mL for amphotericin B and high MICs above the published epidemiological cutoff values for voriconazole ( 8 µg/mL). Patients were successfully treated with topical amphotericin B and voriconazole with complete recovery.
