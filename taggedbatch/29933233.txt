 The implant materials with both osteogenic and anti-bacterial properties are promising for orthopedic and dental applications. Moreover , the inflammatory response induced by biomaterials has been recently recognized as one of the critical factors in determining implantation fate. A new generation of implant materials should have modulatory effects on the local inflammatory environment such that it favors osteogenesis and osteointegration instead of being bio-inert. In this study , the micro-arc oxidation ( MAO) technique was employed to fabricate Cu-containing ceramic coatings on titanium substrates. The macrophages cultured on Cu-containing MAO-fabricated surfaces were polarized to M1 phenotype , evidenced by the high expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS) , low expression levels of arginase1 ( Arg1) , enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 ( IL-6) release and inhibited IL-4 and IL-10 ( anti-inflammatory cytokines) release. The MAO-treated surface incorporated with larger amounts of Cu ( referred as Cu ( h)- MAO) could modulate a favorable inflammatory microenvironment for osteoblast-like cell differentiation. Moreover , the macrophages cultured on Cu ( h)- MAO surface exhibited enhanced bacteria uptake and killing rate , indicating that the Cu ( h)- MAO surface promoted the bactericidal capacity of macrophages. Together , Cu could be used as a promising modulatory agent for macrophage functions. The integration of Cu in biomaterials could lead to enhanced macrophage-mediated osteogenesis and bactericidal capacity.
