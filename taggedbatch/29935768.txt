 The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of oxygen and argon/oxygen low-pressure plasma on the shear bond strength ( SBS) between dental PEEK compounds and veneering composites as a function of plasma process time. Of an unfilled PEEK ( `` Juvora '') and two pigment powder filled PEEK compounds ( `` DC4420 '' , `` DC4450 '') , 273 rectangular plates were prepared and polished up to 1200 grit. Afterwards the samples were sandblasted and randomly assigned to five different surface pre-treatment groups ( 1. No plasma ( control); 2. O The two pigment filled PEEK compounds treated with O A low-pressure plasma process using oxygen plasma for a duration of 35 min , preceded by sandblasting , seems to be the most effective in increasing shear bond strength between veneering composites and PEEK materials.
