 Repeat expansion disorders are a group of inherited neuromuscular diseases , which are caused by expansion mutations of repeat sequences in the disease-causing genes. Repeat expansion disorders include a class of diseases caused by repeat expansions in the coding region of the genes , producing mutant proteins with amino acid repeats , mostly the polyglutamine ( polyQ) diseases , and another class of diseases caused by repeat expansions in the noncoding regions , producing aberrant RNA with expanded repeats , which are called noncoding repeat expansion diseases. A variety of Drosophila disease models have been established for both types of diseases , and they have made significant contributions toward elucidating the molecular mechanisms of and developing therapies for these neuromuscular diseases.
