 The human pulmonary valve , one of the key cardiac structures , plays an important role in circulatory system. However , there are few mathematical models to accurately simulate it. In this paper , we establish a geometric model of the normal human pulmonary valve from a mathematical perspective in the fully opening case. Based on the statistical data of the human pulmonary valves , we assume that the motions of the three cusps are symmetrical in the cardiac cycle. Thus , we first propose that each cusp is a part of the cylindrical shell according to its structure and physiological feature. The parameters for the pulmonary valve cusps in three-dimensional space are obtained by the fitting functions. We verify the accuracy of our results by comparing the areas of the pulmonary valve and pulmonary valve flap.
