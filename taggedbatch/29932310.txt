 Interferon-α2 reduces elevated blood cell counts and splenomegaly<symptom> in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPN) and may restore polyclonal hematopoiesis. Its use is limited by inflammation-mediated toxicity , leading to treatment discontinuation in 10-30 % of patients. Ruxolitinib , a potent anti-inflammatory agent , has demonstrated benefit in myelofibrosis ( MF) and polycythemia vera ( PV) patients. Combination therapy ( CT) with these two agents may be more efficacious than monotherapy with either , potentially improving tolerability of interferon-α2 as well. We report the preliminary results from a phase II study of CT with pegylated interferon-α2 and ruxolitinib in 50 MPN patients ( PV , n = 32; low-/ intermediate-1-risk MF , n = 18) , the majority ( n = 47) being resistant and/or intolerant to interferon-α2 monotherapy. Objectives included remission ( 2013 revised criteria encompassing histologic , hematologic , and clinical responses) , complete hematologic response ( CHR) , molecular response , and toxicity. Follow-up was 12 months. Partial remission ( PR) and sustained CHR were achieved in 9 % and 44 % of PV patients , respectively. In MF patients , complete or partial remission was achieved in 39 % , and sustained CHR in 58 %. The median JAK2V617F allele burden declined significantly in both groups. Hematologic toxicity was the most common adverse event and was managed by dose reduction. Thirty-seven serious adverse events were recorded in 23 patients; the discontinuation rate was 20 %. We conclude that CT with interferon-α2 and ruxolitinib is efficacious in patients with low-/ intermediate-1-risk MF and , to a lesser extent , in patients with PV. These preliminary results encourage phase III studies as well as a study with CT in newly diagnosed MPN patients.
