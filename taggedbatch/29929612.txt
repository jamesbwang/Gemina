 Spontaneous ruptured aortic plaques ( SRAP) , which might cause atheromatous embolization , are thought to be mainly iatrogenic and have not been observed directly. The purpose of this study was to clarify the incidence , types , and dimensions of SRAP using angioscopy. In a cross-sectional study , 324 consecutive patients diagnosed with or suspected of having coronary artery disease were subjected to intra-aortic scans with nonobstructive angioscopy. Samples of SRAP were taken from the aorta. The dimensions of cholesterol crystals of atheromatous materials were measured with a polarizing microscope and compared with those of the ghost images of cholesterol crystals. SRAP were detected in 262 patients ( 80.9 %); 120 of 262 patients had ruptured aortic plaques below the diaphragmatic level. Samples were successfully obtained from 96 patients. The detected numbers of atheromatous material , fibrin , macrophage , and calcification were 237 ( 49.1 %) , 244 ( 50.6 %) , 111 ( 23.0 %) , and 127 ( 26.3 %) out of 482 samples , respectively. The median lengths and widths of the sampled plaques were 254 μm ( interquartile range ( IQR): 100 to 685 μm) and 148 μm ( IQR: 535 to 423.5 μm) , respectively. The lengths and widths of the cholesterol crystals isolated from atheromatous materials were 40 μm ( IQR: 32.7 to 53.7 μm) , and 30 μm ( IQR: 23 to 38 μm) , respectively , compared with the respective dimensions of the ghost images of 86 μm ( IQR: 53 to 119) and 13 μm ( IQR: 7 to 18 μm). No embolic symptoms were observed within 24 h of general care via cardiac catheterization. SRAP are commonly scattered , and their dimensions were smaller than previously recognized.
