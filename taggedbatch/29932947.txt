 The long-term risk of seizures<symptom> in cardiac arrest survivors is not established. We hypothesized that survivors of cardiac arrest face an increased long-term risk for seizures<symptom>. We performed a retrospective cohort study using 2008-2015 claims data from a nationally representative 5 % sample of Medicare beneficiaries â‰¥ 66 years-old. Our exposure of interest was a hospital diagnosis code of cardiac arrest , defined by previously validated ICD-9-CM codes. Since we were interested in long-term risk , we excluded patients with a history of seizure<symptom> , and those who were diagnosed with a seizure<symptom> during hospitalization or died during the index hospitalization. Our outcome was a diagnosis of seizure<symptom>. Survival statistics were used to calculate seizure<symptom> incidence and Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the association between cardiac arrest and long-term seizures<symptom> after adjustment for demographics and Charlson comorbidities. Among 1,764,508 beneficiaries with a mean 4.5 years of follow-up , we identified 57,437 patients with cardiac arrest who survived to discharge without a seizure<symptom>. The annual incidence of seizures<symptom> was 1.26 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.20-1.33 %) compared to 0.61 % ( 95 % CI , 0.61-0.62 %) in other Medicare patients. In unadjusted analysis , cardiac arrest was associated with an increased risk of post-discharge seizures<symptom> ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 1.8; 95 % CI , 1.7-1.9) , but the association was lost after adjustment for demographics and comorbidities ( HR 0.9; 95 % CI , 0.9-1.0; P = 0.12). The long-term risk of seizures<symptom> was not elevated in patients with cardiac arrest who survived to hospital discharge without a seizure<symptom>.
