 Riverine particulate organic matter is generally considered to be refractory with respect to further decomposition in the ocean. In order to check the validity of this paradigm , there is a real need for tracers sufficiently stable and specific to monitor the degradation of terrestrial higher plant material in the environment. 3β-hydroxy-urs-12-en-11-one and 3β-hydroxy-olean-12-en-11-one ( autoxidation products of α- and β-amyrin) were previously proposed for such use. EIMS fragmentation pathways of 3β-hydroxy-urs-12-en-11-one and 3β-hydroxy-olean-12-en-11-one TMS derivatives were investigated. These pathways were deduced by: ( i) low energy CID-GC/MS/MS , ( ii) accurate mass measurement and ( iii) deuterium labelling. Quantification of these compounds in total lipid extracts of natural samples was then carried out in MRM mode. CID-MS/MS analyses , accurate mass measurement and deuterium labelling experiments allowed us to elucidate EIMS fragmentations of 3β-hydroxy-urs-12-en-11-one and 3β-hydroxy-olean-12-en-11-one TMS derivatives. Some specific fragmentation pathways , useful in addition to chromatographic retention times for further characterization , could be selected. As an application of some of the described fragmentations , TMS derivatives of these oxidation products were characterized and quantified in MRM mode in different natural samples. EIMS fragmentations of 3β-hydroxy-urs-12-en-11-one and 3β-hydroxy-olean-12-en-11-one TMS derivatives exhibit specific fragment ions , which appear to be very useful for the quantification of these oxidation products in natural samples ( riverine particulate matter , wet and dry deposited atmospheric particles).
