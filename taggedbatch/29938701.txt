 The introduction of tenofovir ( TFV) alafenamide ( TAF) into clinical practice will be a further revolution in antiretroviral therapy. Currently available HIV-1 regimens are wide enough to allow diversified usage in different settings. Despite the fact that TAF is not capillary accessible , even in industrialized countries , ultimate International Guidelines have already included TAF in backbone or in single-tablet regimens. Due to a better safety profile , TAF will progressively replace TFV disoproxil fumarate , both in naïve and experienced patients. However , therapeutic innovations have to deal with budget constraints and different global spending-review patterns. The aim of this article is to give a comprehensive agenda of TAF use in naïve and experienced HIV-1 infected patients , providing a full review of the studies present in the literature and contextualizing these findings into daily clinical practice.
