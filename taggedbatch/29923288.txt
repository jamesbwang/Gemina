 To combine social genomics with cultural approaches to expand understandings of the somatic health dynamics of online gaming , including in the controversial nosological construct of internet gaming disorder ( IGD). In blood samples from 56 U.S. gamers , we examined expression of the conserved transcriptional response to adversity ( CTRA) , a leukocyte gene expression profile activated by chronic stress. We compared positively engaged and problem gamers , as identified by an ethnographically developed measure , the Positive and Negative Gaming Experiences Scale ( PNGE-42) , and also by a clinically derived IGD scale ( IGDS-SF9). CTRA profiles showed a clear relationship with PNGE-42 , with a substantial linkage to offline social support , but were not meaningfully associated with disordered play as measured by IGDS-SF9. Our study advances understanding of the psychobiology of play , demonstrating via novel transcriptomic methods the association of negatively experienced internet play with biological measures of chronic threat , uncertainty , and distress. Our findings are consistent with the view that problematic patterns of online gaming are a proxy for broader patterns of biopsychosocial stress and distress such as loneliness , rather than a psychiatric disorder sui generis , which might exist apart from gamers ' other life problems. By confirming the biological correlates of certain patterns of internet gaming , culturally-sensitive genomics approaches such as this can inform both evolutionary theorizing regarding the nature of play , as well as current psychiatric debates about the appropriateness of modeling distressful gaming on substance addiction and problem gambling.
