 Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 ( PAD4) is a nuclear citrullinating enzyme that is critically involved in the release of decondensed chromatin from neutrophils as neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs). NETs , together with fibrin , are implicated in host defense against pathogens; however , the formation of NETs ( NETosis) has injurious effects that may outweigh their protective role. For example , PAD4 activity produces citrullinated neoantigens that promote autoimmune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> , to which PAD4 is genetically linked and where NETosis is prominent. NETs are also generated in basic sterile inflammatory responses that are induced by many inflammatory stimuli , including cytokines , hypoxia , and activated platelets. Mice that lack PAD4-deficient in NETosis-serve as an excellent tool with which to study the importance of NETs in disease models. In recent years , animal and human studies have demonstrated that NETs contribute to the etiology and propagation of many common noninfectious diseases , the focus of our review. We will discuss the role of NETs in thrombotic and cardiovascular disease , the induction of NETs by cancers and its implications for cancer progression and cancer-associated thrombosis , and elevated NETosis in diabetes and its negative impact on wound<disease><symptom> healing , and will propose a link between PAD4/NETs and age-related organ fibrosis<disease>. We identify unresolved issues and new research directions.-Wong , S. L. , Wagner , D.<pathogen> D.
