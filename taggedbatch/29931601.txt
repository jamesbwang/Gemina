 Interferon beta ( IFNβ) is transiently expressed in response to viral<disease> infections<disease> and widely used to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( MS). We introduced mutations in the IFNβ gene ( in the 27th and 101st codons and in the Kozak sequence , and also deletion of 3 ' and 5 ' unstable , untranslated region , UTR) with the aim of increasing the expression of IFNβ. Computational analyses of mutant and wild-type RNAs and proteins of IFNβ by RNAfold , ASAView , HOPE and Ramachandran plot , and iStable web servers showed that the mutations could decrease RNA stability , protein solvent accessibility , and protein stability but could not change correct folding. Two recombinant IFNβ101 and IFNβ101 +27 constructs were designed by site-directed mutagenesis. The wild-type IFNβ gene also was used as a control. In vitro experiments by quantitative real-time PCR , dot blot , SDS-PAGE , and Western blot assays showed an increased expression level of recombinant IFNβs. 79.9-fold , 99.7-fold , and 190-fold elevations in the mRNA expression of IFNβw , IFNβ101 , and IFNβ101 +27 were seen , respectively , in comparison with the endogenous IFNβ mRNA in untransfected HEK293T cells. The IFNβ mRNA expression was increased 2.38-fold and 1.25-fold for 101 +27 and 101 mutated forms , respectively , in comparison with the IFNβ wild-type construct. An elevation in IFNβ protein production was also clearly detected in the transfected HEK293T cell containing recombinant IFNβ101 and IFNβ101 +27 constructs. Finally , these directed mutations in the IFNβ gene successfully elevated protein and mRNA production but in silico analyses of mutant mRNAs showed decreased mRNA stability , unlike previous studies , in comparison with the wild-type mRNA.
