 Background Virtual monochromatic images ( VMI) generated using spectral computed tomography ( CT) are promising recently available tools to improve diagnostic performance in oncologic patients. Purpose To investigate if virtual monochromatic datasets are suitable for clinical routine use in patients with hypervascularized abdominal tumors. Material and Methods A total of 41 patients with hypervascularized hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) , renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) , or neuroendocrine tumors ( NET) were enrolled in the study; 451 CT series were analyzed. In an intra-individual study design , virtual monochromatic datasets of the arterial phase of each scan were computed. Image quality was assessed objectively by determining signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios ( CNR) and subjectively by using five-point Likert-scales. The volume CT dose index ( CTDI
