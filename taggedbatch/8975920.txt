 Excessive activation of neutrophils results in the release of neutrophil elastase ( NE) , which leads to lung injury in severe pneumonia<disease>. Previously , we demonstrated a novel immune subversion mechanism involving microbial exploitation of this NE ability , which eventually promotes disruption of the pulmonary epithelial barrier. In the present study , we investigated the effect of NE on host innate immune response. THP-1-derived macrophages were stimulated with heat-killed
