 Therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM) of clozapine is a very useful method for verifying both the correct intake and the interindividual variability of its metabolism , thereby avoiding the risk of toxicity. The purposes of this paper were to discover how many patients using clozapine in common clinical practice have clozapine plasma concentration ( PC) levels in the proposed reference range and to identify factors that influence clozapine PC levels. Our study included 100 inpatients ( diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) taking standard doses of clozapine ( 100-700 mg/day). Clozapine concentration was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Correlations between doses and PC levels and the influence of smoking and gender on clozapine PC levels were calculated. A large number of the patients ( 67 %) had PC levels outside the proposed reference range. The clozapine PC levels were influenced by dose , gender , and cigarette smoking. The correlations between dose , gender , and cigarette smoking and clozapine PC levels highlighted by our study overlap other research. It was surprising to find such a large number of patients with clozapine PC levels outside the therapeutic range. This result suggests the importance of clozapine TDM due to misunderstood inter- and/or intraindividual variability or misestimated partial therapeutic compliance.
