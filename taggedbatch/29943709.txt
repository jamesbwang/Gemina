 The western region of Edo state in southern Nigeria is highly endemic for onchocerciasis. Despite years of mass drug administration ( MDA) with ivermectin ( IVM) , reports suggest persistently high prevalence of onchocerciasis , presumably because of poor coverage. In 2016 , twice-per-year treatment with IVM ( combined with albendazole for lymphatic filariasis<disease> in the first round where needed) began in five local government areas ( LGAs) of Edo state. We undertook a multistage cluster survey within 3 months after each round of MDA to assess coverage. First-round coverage was poor: among 4,942 people of all ages interviewed from 145 clusters , coverage was 31.1 % ( 95 % confidence intervals ( CI): 24.1-38.0 %). Most respondents were not offered medicines. To improve coverage in the second round , three LGAs were randomized to receive MDA through a `` modified campaign '' approach focused on improved supervision and monitoring. The other two LGAs continued with standard MDA as before. A similar survey was conducted after the second round , interviewing 3,362 people in 87 clusters across the five LGAs. Coverage was not statistically different from the first round ( 40.0 % ( 95 % CI: 31.0-49.0 %)) and there was no significant difference between the groups (
