 The attention training technique ( ATT) is a component of metacognitive therapy developed to interrupt self-focused , threat-based processing underlying anxiety<symptom> disorders. Whereas extant research supports the benefits of ATT , including in relation to anxiety<symptom> reduction , study findings lead to equivocal conclusions as to whether ATT causally interrupts self-focused attention ( SFA) as intended. An additional gap in the literature relates to investigating if ATT is especially effective for reducing anxiety<symptom> among individuals experiencing a heightened self-focused state. The present study sought to address those two gaps in the literature. Participants scoring high on a measure of general worry severity completed a worry provocation that increased SFA and then were randomized to ATT ( n = 45) , a mindfulness task ( n = 44) , or a distraction task ( n = 44). ATT caused large reductions in SFA , whereas there were no changes in focus of attention following the mindfulness or distraction task. Anxiety<symptom> reduction was found in relation to all three tasks; however , ATT , relative to distraction , was found to cause greater reduction in cognitive anxiety<symptom> for individuals highly self-focused before the task. The present study used an analogue sample and the design did not allow for an examination of the long-term benefit of ATT. Results support ATT causally interrupting self-focused states and that ATT is particularly effective in reducing cognitive anxiety<symptom> among individuals who are self-focused.
