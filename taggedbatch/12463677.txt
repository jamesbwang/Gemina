 Although the crucial importance of sediments in aquatic systems is well-known , sediments are often neglected as a factor in the evaluation of water quality assessment. To support and extend previous work in that field , this study was conducted to assess the impact of surface water and sediment on fish embryos in the case of a highly anthropogenically influenced river catchment in Central Hesse , Germany. The results of 96 h post fertilisation fish embryo toxicity test with A clear relationship between anthropogenic point sources and detected effects could not be established. However , the study illustrates the critical condition of the entire river system with respect to embryotoxic potentials present even at the most upstream test sites. In addition , the study stresses the necessity to take into account sediments for the evaluation of ecosystem health in industrialised areas.
