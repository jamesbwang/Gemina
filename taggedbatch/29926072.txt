 The protein acetylation by histone acetyltransferases ( HATs) and histone deacetylases ( HDACs) plays a significant role in the development and maturation of the nervous system. HDAC6 , belonging to class II HDACs , by regulating the survival , differentiation and maturation of neural cells , plays an important role in the development of the nervous system and participates in multiple pathological processes of cerebral ischemic injury. In addition , HDAC6 participates in the regulation of cognition and emotion of the brain. This article summarized the latest research results in recent years and expounded that HDAC6 inhibitors could produce a positive and effective neuroprotective effect on ischemic stroke by reducing the neuronal damage induced by excitotoxicity and oxidative stress , depressing the release of inflammatory mediators , inhibiting the apoptosis of neurons and promoting the growth of nerve and blood vessel.
