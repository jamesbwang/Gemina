 Three aryl-tetralin-type lignans , including 2 previously undescribed compounds , were isolated from the root of Sanguisorba officinalis. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopic analyses and mass spectrometry. Experimental and calculated ECD were used to determine the absolute configurations. The isolated compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity against two cell lines ( MV4-11 and MDA-MB-231) and compound 1 exhibited moderate growth inhibition against MDA-MB-231 cell line with IC
