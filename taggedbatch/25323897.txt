 The prevalence of osteoporosis is increasing with the aging population and is associated with increased risk of fracture and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Osteoporosis is currently treated with bisphosphonate therapy to attenuate bone loss. We previously reported that improvement in bone mineral density is not sufficient to reduce osteoporosis-related pain in an ovariectomy ( OVX)- induced mouse model of osteoporosis , highlighting the need for new treatments. Targeting of nerve growth factor ( NGF) with sequestering antibodies is a promising new direction for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain including back pain and arthritis<disease><symptom>. Its efficacy is currently unknown for osteoporotic pain. To investigate the efficacy of anti-NGF antibody therapy on osteoporotic pain in an OVX-induced mouse model. Ovariectomy- and sham-operated mice were injected with an anti-NGF antibody ( 10 mg/kg , intraperitoneally , administered 2 Ã— , 14 days apart) , and the effect on behavioural indices of osteoporosis-related pain and on sensory neuron plasticity was evaluated. Treatment with anti-NGF antibodies attenuated OVX-induced hypersensitivity<disease> to mechanical , cold , and heat stimuli on the plantar surface of the hind paw. The OVX-induced impairment in grip force strength , used here as a measure of axial discomfort , was partially reversed by anti-NGF therapy. No changes were observed in the rotarod or open-field tests for overall motor function and activity. Finally , anti-NGF treatment attenuated the increase in calcitonin gene-related peptide-immunoreactive dorsal root ganglia neurons observed in OVX mice. Taken together , these data suggest that anti-NGF antibodies may be useful in the treatment of prefracture hypersensitivity<disease> that is reported in 10 % of patients with osteoporosis.
