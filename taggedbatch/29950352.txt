 Although somatostatin analogues ( SSA) and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy ( PRRT) are validated therapies in patients with advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ( GEP-NETs) , it remains unclear whether SSA combined with PRRT or as maintenance therapy can provide prolonged survival compared to patients treated with PRRT alone. In this retrospective study , we aimed to investigate whether there is a survival benefit to adding SSA to PRRT as a combination therapy and/or maintenance therapy. The investigation included 168 patients with unresectable GEP-NETs treated at the University Hospital Bonn , Germany. The patients were divided into two main groups: PRRT monotherapy ( N = 81 , group 1) and PRRT plus SSA ( N = 87 , group 2) as combined therapy with PRRT and/or as maintenance therapy after PRRT. Data for overall survival ( OS) were available from 168 patients , of whom 160 had data for progression-free survival ( PFS). The median PFS was 27 months in group 1 vs. 48 months in group 2 ( p = 0.012). The median OS rates were 47 months in group 1 and 91 months in group 2 ( p < 0.001). The death-event rates were lower in group 2 ( 26 %) than in group 1 ( 63 %). SSA as a combination therapy with PRRT and/or as a maintenance therapy showed a clinical benefit rate ( objective response or stable disease) of 95 % , which was significantly higher than group 1 ( 79 %). SSA as a combination therapy and/or maintenance therapy may play a significant role in tumor control in patients with GEP-NET who underwent a PRRT.
