 Post-traumatic epilepsy ( PTE) occurs in 20 % of individuals with acquired epilepsy , and can impact significantly the quality of life due to the seizures<symptom> and other functional or cognitive and behavioral outcomes of the traumatic brain injury ( TBI) and PTE. There is no available antiepileptogenic or disease modifying treatment for PTE. Animal models of TBI and PTE have been developed , offering useful insights on the value of inflammatory , neurodegenerative pathways , hemorrhages<symptom> and iron accumulation , calcium channels and other target pathways that could be used for treatment development. Most of the existing preclinical studies test efficacy towards pathologies of functional recovery after TBI , while a few studies are emerging testing the effects towards induced or spontaneous<symptom> seizures<symptom>. Here we review the existing preclinical trials testing new candidate treatments for TBI sequelae and PTE , and discuss future directions for efforts aiming at developing antiepileptogenic and disease-modifying treatments.
