 Viral envelope proteins are required for productive viral entry and initiation of infection. Although the humoral immune system provides ample evidence for targeting envelope proteins as an antiviral strategy , there are few pharmacological interventions that have this mode of action. In contrast to classical antiviral targets such as viral proteases and polymerases , viral envelope proteins as a class do not have a well-conserved active site that can be rationally targeted with small molecules. We previously identified compounds that inhibit dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> by binding to its envelope protein , E. Here , we show that these small molecules inhibit dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> fusion and map the binding site of these compounds to a specific pocket on E. We further demonstrate inhibition of Zika , West<pathogen><disease> Nile , and Japanese<pathogen><disease> encephalitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> viruses by these compounds , providing pharmacological evidence for the pocket as a target for developing broad-spectrum antivirals against multiple , mosquito-borne flavivirus<pathogen> pathogens.
