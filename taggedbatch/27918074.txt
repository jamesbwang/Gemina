 A hallmark of metazoan evolution is the emergence of genomic mechanisms that implement cell-type-specific functions. However , the evolution of metazoan cell types and their underlying gene regulatory programmes remains largely uncharacterized. Here , we use whole-organism single-cell RNA sequencing to map cell-type-specific transcription in Porifera ( sponges) , Ctenophora ( comb jellies) and Placozoa species. We describe the repertoires of cell types in these non-bilaterian animals , uncovering diverse instances of previously unknown molecular signatures , such as multiple types of peptidergic cells in Placozoa. Analysis of the regulatory programmes of these cell types reveals variable levels of complexity. In placozoans and poriferans , sequence motifs in the promoters are predictive of cell-type-specific programmes. By contrast , the generation of a higher diversity of cell types in ctenophores is associated with lower specificity of promoter sequences and the existence of distal regulatory elements. Our findings demonstrate that metazoan cell types can be defined by networks of transcription factors and proximal promoters , and indicate that further genome regulatory complexity may be required for more diverse cell type repertoires.
