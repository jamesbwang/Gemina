 Juvenile idiopathic arthritis<disease><symptom> ( JIA) is an inflammatory arthritis<disease><symptom> of unknown etiology , which lasts for greater than 6 weeks with onset before 16 years of age. JIA is the most common chronic rheumatic disease in children. NSAIDs have been the mainstay of initial management with naproxen ( NAP) being commonly used , but they may cause serious side effects such as gastric ulcers<disease><symptom> which can be reduced by concomitant administration of proton pump inhibitors , such as esomeprazole ( ESO). Primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 3 fixed doses of NAP/ESO in JIA patients aged 12 to 16 years. Forty-six children and adolescents with JIA by International League of Associations for Rheumatology criteria , mean age of 13.6 years , from 18 US sites were prospectively enrolled over 2 years and followed for up to 6 months. Doses of the NAP/ESO fixed combination were based on baseline weight. The exploratory efficacy outcome was assessed with the ACR Pediatric-30 ,- 50 ,- 70 ,- 90 Response and the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire ( CHAQ) discomfort and functional scores at months 1 , 3 , and 6 as change from baseline. Occurrence and causality were assessed for treatment emergent AEs ( TEAEs) and discontinuations were monitored monthly. Forty-six patients received at least 1 dose of naproxen/esomeprazole and 36 completed the trial. Thirty-seven ( 80.4 %) had at least 1 treatment emergent adverse event ( TEAE) and , with the exception of 2 events in one patient , all of the TEAEs were mild or moderate. Frequent TEAEs ( â‰¥ 5 % of patients) were upper respiratory<disease><symptom> tract<symptom> and gastrointestinal related. Eleven ( 23.9 %) had at least 1 TEAE considered to be related to study drug. Four patients ( 8.7 %) discontinued due to a TEAE with one of these being the only serious AE reported , acute hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom>. Mean number of active joints at baseline was 3.1. Improvement in JIA signs and symptoms occurred at most assessments and by month 6 , the percentage of patients with an ACR Pediatric-30 ,- 50 ,- 70 , and- 90 Response was 47.1 , 38.2 , 32.4 , and 17.6 % , respectively. The percent of patients achieving ACR Pediatric response increased over time. CHAQ discomfort improved at each assessment and functional scores improved at all assessments for ` Arising , Walking , and Activities ' with several improved for ` Dressing and Grooming , Eating , Hygiene , and Grip '. There was no indication of a dose-related efficacy effect. NAP/ESO was well tolerated in JIA patients aged 12 to 16 years with high levels of response to ACR criteria. No new safety signals were identified for the well-characterized components of this fixed dosed JIA treatment , which was developed to reduce the risk of gastric ulcers<disease><symptom>.
