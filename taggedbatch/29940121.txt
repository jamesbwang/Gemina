 Recently we reported that rapid determination of enthalpy of binding can be achieved for a large number of congeneric agents or in combinatorial libraries fairly efficiently. We show that using a thermodynamic Craig plot can be very useful in dissecting the enthalpy and entropy contribution of different substituents on a common scaffold , in order to design potent , selective , or pan-active compounds. In our implementation , the approach identified a critical Lys residue in the BIR3 domain of XIAP. We report for the first time that it is possible to target such residue covalently to attain potent and selective agents. Preliminary cellular studies in various models of leukemia<disease> , multiple myeloma , and pancreatic cancers suggest that the derived agents possess a potentially intriguing pattern of activity , especially for cell lines that are resistant to the pan-IAP antagonist and clinical candidate LCL161.
