 Serelaxin , recombinant human relaxin-2 , is a hormone with vasodilatory and end-organ protective effects. Recently , it has been licensed to treat acute decompensated heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Here , a systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) was performed to assess the effect of serelaxin on mortality and dyspnea<symptom> improvement in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. RCTs comparing serelaxin treatment to other heart<symptom> failure<symptom> treatments were searched in PubMed , Embase , Cochrane Library , and ClinicalTrials.gov. The main endpoints were mortality and dyspnea<symptom> improvement. Pooled data were assessed by using a random effects model. A total of 451 studies were identified , of which 8 studies ( 8477 participants) were eligible and included in our analysis. Compared with other heart<symptom> failure<symptom> treatment group , serelaxin group had no effect on 30-day , 60-day , and 180-day mortality ( OR , 0.79; 95 % CI , 0.65-0.96). Compared with control group , there was no effect on dyspnea<symptom> improvement. Serelaxin treatment is irrelevant with the mortality , and it can not improve dyspnea<symptom> of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients.
