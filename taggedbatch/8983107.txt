 Incisional herniation is a common complication after abdominal surgery associated with considerable morbidity. The aim of this study was to determine whether incisional hernia is an early complication , in order to understand better the aetiology of incisional hernia formation. This study involved the secondary analysis of a subset of patients included in a large RCT comparing small and large tissue bites ( 5 mm every 5 mm , or 1 cm every 1 cm) in patients scheduled to undergo elective abdominal surgery by midline laparotomy. The distance between the rectus<pathogen> abdominis muscles ( RAM distance) was measured by standardized ultrasound imaging 1 month and 1 year after surgery. The relationship between the 1-year incidence of incisional hernia and the RAM distance at 1 month was investigated. Some 219 patients were investigated , 113 in the small-bites and 106 in the large-bites group. At 1 month after surgery the RAM distance was smaller for small bites than for large bites ( mean ( s.d.) 1 · 90 ( 1 · 18) versus 2 · 39 ( 1 · 34) cm respectively; P = 0 · 005). At 1 year , patients with incisional hernia had a longer RAM distance at 1 month than those with no incisional hernia ( mean ( s.d.) 2 · 43 ( 1 · 48) versus 2 · 03 ( 1 · 19) cm respectively; relative risk 1 · 14 , 95 per cent c.i. 1 · 03 to 1 · 26 , P = 0 · 015). A RAM distance greater than 2 cm at 1 month after midline laparotomy is associated with incisional hernia. Closure with small bites results in a smaller distance between the muscles.
