 Sewage sludge ( SS) and deinking sludge ( DS) were used to comparatively study the hydrothermal dewatering of sludge with different components. For a better overview , an insight into the relationship between physicochemical properties and dewaterability of hydrothermal sludge was provided. Results found that not all kinds of sludge were suitably conditioned by hydrothermal treatment ( HT) in term of the elevation of dewaterability. Higher hydrothermal temperature tended to enhance the dewaterability of SS rather than DS , which was supported by the variation of their physicochemical properties ( including water distribution , bonding energy , extracellular polymeric substance ( EPS) , particles size , acid functional groups and zeta potential in this study). In addition , the changes in surface morphology suggested that the reverse effect of HT on sludge dewaterability was mainly due to their dewatering behavior. For SS , the destruction of EPS structure leaded to the release of bound water , thereby strengthening sludge dewatering. Conversely , `` Bridging effect '' generated by lignocellulose in DS was beneficial for sludge dewatering; however , the increasing hydrothermal temperature degraded part of lignocellulose and weakened `` bridging effect '' , finally resulting in worse dewaterability of DS.
