 The use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF) in the treatment of HIV<pathogen> infection has been associated with renal dysfunction. In Nigeria , data on the incidence and risk factors of TDF nephrotoxicity is sparse. We determined the cumulative incidence of and risk factors for TDF-induced renal impairment in HIV-infected individuals accessing care at the antiretroviral therapy ( ART) clinic of Jos University Teaching Hospital , Nigeria. This retrospective cohort analysis included patients aged ≥ 16 years that initiated ART between January 2008 and December 2011. Renal impairment , defined as glomerular filtration rate GFR < 60 mL/min/1 .73 sqm using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease ( MDRD) equation was assessed at baseline and at 48 weeks on ART. Logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with incident renal impairment. The mean age was 39 ± 9 years , and 67.1 % were female. The cumulative incidence of renal impairment among the TDF-exposed and TDF-unexposed groups was 4.6 % and 2.3 % respectively ( p < 0.001). TDF exposure was significantly associated with renal impairment ( OR = 2.0 , 95 % CI = ( 1.48-2.89) , p < 0.001) in bivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis , older age ( aOR = 1.06 , 95 % CI = ( 1.05-1.08) , p < 0.001) , TDF exposure ( aOR = 1.85 , 95 % CI = ( 1.31-2.60) , p < 0.001) and co-morbidities ( aOR = 2.71 , 95 % CI = ( 1.72-4.25) , p < 0.001) were significantly associated with renal impairment. TDF exposure , aging and comorbidities were predictors of renal toxicity among HIV<pathogen> positive patients. Regular monitoring of renal function in such high-risk individuals is recommended.
