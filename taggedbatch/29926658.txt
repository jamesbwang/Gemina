 To investigate the effect of rosuvastatin on homocysteine ( Hcy) induced mousevascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs) dedifferentiation and endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ERS). VSMCs were co-cultured with Hcy and different concentration of rosuvastatin ( 0.1 , 1.0 and 10 μmol/L). Cytoskeleton remodeling , VSMCs phenotype markers ( smooth muscle actin-α , calponin and osteopontin) and ERS marker mRNAs ( Herpud1 , XBP1s and GRP78) were detected at predicted time. Tunicamycin was used to induce , respectively 4-phenylbutyrate ( 4-PBA) inhibition , ERS in VSMCs and cellular migration , proliferation and expression of phenotype proteins were analyzed. Mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR)- P70S6 kinase ( P70S6K) signaling agonist phosphatidic acid and inhibitor rapamycin were used in Rsv<pathogen> treated VSMCs. And then mTOR signaling and ERS associated mRNAs were detected. Compared with Hcy group , Hcy + Rsv<pathogen> group ( 1.0 and 10 μmol/L) showed enhanced α-SMA and calponin expression ( Rosuvastatin could inhibit Hcy induced VSMCs dedifferentiation
