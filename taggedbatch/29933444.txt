 Physicians often accuse their peers of being `` black clouds '' if they repeatedly have more than the average number of hospital admissions while on call. Our purpose was to determine whether the black-cloud phenomenon is real or explainable by random variation. We analyzed hospital admissions to the University of Iowa family medicine service from July 1 , 2010 to June 30 , 2015. Analyses were stratified by peer group ( eg , night shift attending physicians , day shift senior residents). We analyzed admission numbers to find evidence of black-cloud physicians ( those with significantly more admissions than their peers) and white-cloud physicians ( those with significantly fewer admissions). The statistical significance of whether there were actual differences across physicians was tested with mixed-effects negative binomial regression. The 5-year study included 96 physicians and 6,194 admissions. The number of daytime admissions ranged from 0 to 10 ( mean 2.17 , SD 1.63). Night admissions ranged from 0 to 11 ( mean 1.23 , SD 1.22). Admissions increased from 1,016 in the first year to 1,523 in the fifth year. We found 18 white-cloud and 16 black-cloud physicians in simple regression models that did not control for this upward trend. After including study year and other potential confounding variables in the regression models , there were no significant associations between physicians and admission numbers and therefore no true black or white clouds. In this study , apparent black-cloud and white-cloud physicians could be explained by random variation in hospital admissions. However , this randomness incorporated a wide range in workload among physicians , with potential impact on resident education at the low end and patient safety at the high end.
