 Signal regulatory protein α ( SIRPα) , also known as cluster of differentiation ( CD) 172a or Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase substrate-1 , is a cell surface receptor expressed on myeloid and hematopoietic stem cells and neurons. Accumulating data suggests an important role of SIRPα in cell signaling as a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. In various cancers , including prostate , breast and liver , as well as astrocytoma and myeloid malignancies , downregulation of SIRPα is frequently observed , resulting in activation of these downstream signaling pathways. In turn , cell proliferation , transformation , migration and invasion may occur. Recently , it has been reported that blocking CD47 , an anti-phagocytic signal expressed on tumor cells and an SIRPα ligand , may serve as a promising therapeutic approach , particular for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia<disease>. In the present review , the current findings on SIRPα are summarized , with particular focus on its role in cancer.
