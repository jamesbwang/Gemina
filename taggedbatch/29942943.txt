 Acoustic forces arising from high-frequency surface acoustic waves ( SAW) underpin an exciting range of promising techniques for non-contact manipulation of fluid and objects at micron scale. Despite increasing significance of SAW-driven technologies in microfluidics , the understanding of a broad range of phenomena occurring within an individual SAW system is limited. Acoustic effects including streaming and radiation force fields are often assumed to result from wave propagation in a simple planar fashion. The propagation patterns of a single SAW emanating from a finite-width source , however , cause a far richer range of physical effects. In this work , we seek a better understanding of the various effects arising from the incidence of a finite-width SAW beam propagating into a quiescent fluid. Through numerical and experimental verification , we present five distinct mechanisms within an individual system. These cause fluid swirling in two orthogonal planes , and particle trapping in two directions , as well as migration of particles in the direction of wave propagation. For a range of IDT aperture and channel dimensions , the relative importance of these mechanisms is evaluated.
