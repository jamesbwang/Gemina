 The burden of chronic<symptom> headache<symptom> disorders in the United States is substantial. Some patients are treatment refractory. Ketamine , an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist , provides potent analgesia in subanesthetic doses in chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , and limited data suggest it may alleviate headache<symptom> in some patients. We performed a retrospective study of 61 patients admitted over 3 years for 5 days of intravenous therapy that included continuous ketamine to determine responder rate and patient and ketamine infusion characteristics. Pain ratings at 2 follow-up visits were recorded. An immediate responder was a patient with decrease of 2 points or greater in the numerical rating scale ( 0-10) from start to final pain in the hospital. Sustained response at office visits 1 and 2 was determined based on maintaining the 2-point improvement at those visits. Patients were assessed daily for pain and adverse events ( AEs). Forty-eight ( 77 %) of the 61 patients were immediate responders. There were no differences regarding demographics , opioid use , or fibromyalgia between immediate responders and nonresponders. Maximum improvement occurred 4.56 days ( mean) into treatment. Sustained response occurred in 40 % of patients at visit 1 ( mean , 38.1 days) and 39 % of patients at visit 2 ( mean , 101.3 days). The mean maximum ketamine rate was 65.2 Â± 2.8 mg/h ( 0.76 mg/kg per hour). Ketamine rates did not differ between groups. Adverse events occurred equally in responders and nonresponders and were mild. Ketamine was associated with short-term analgesia in many refractory headache<symptom> patients with tolerable adverse events. A prospective study is warranted to confirm this and elucidate responder characteristics.
