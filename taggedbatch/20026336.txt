 Assembly and/or insertion of a subset of mitochondrial outer membrane ( MOM) proteins , including subunits of the main MOM translocase<disease> , require the fungi-specific Mim1/Mim2 complex. So far it was unclear which proteins accomplish this task in other eukaryotes. Here , we show by reciprocal complementation that the MOM protein pATOM36 of trypanosomes is a functional analogue of yeast Mim1/Mim2 complex , even though these proteins show neither sequence nor topological similarity. Expression of pATOM36 rescues almost all growth , mitochondrial biogenesis , and morphology defects in yeast cells lacking Mim1 and/or Mim2. Conversely , co-expression of Mim1 and Mim2 restores the assembly and/or insertion defects of MOM proteins in trypanosomes ablated for pATOM36. Mim1/Mim2 and pATOM36 form native-like complexes when heterologously expressed , indicating that additional proteins are not part of these structures. Our findings indicate that Mim1/Mim2 and pATOM36 are the products of convergent evolution and arose only after the ancestors of fungi<pathogen> and trypanosomatids diverged.
