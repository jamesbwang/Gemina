 Cryptogenic forms of epileptic encephalopathies ( EE) with their well-known features of drug-resistance , mental deterioration and partial response to immunotherapies are ideal candidates for screening for neuronal autoantibodies ( NAA). Fifty consecutive pediatric patients with a diagnosis of EE of unknown cause were included. Nine NAAs were tested by ELISA , RIA or cell-based assays. Clinical features of seronegative and seropositive patients were compared. NAAs were found in 7/50 ( 14 %) patients. They were N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor in two ( 4 %) , glycine receptor in two ( 4 %) , contactin-associated protein-like 2 in one ( 2 %) , glutamic acid decarboxylase in one ( 2 %) and type A gamma aminobutyric acid receptor in one patient ( 2 %). Furthermore , serum IgGs of two patients negative for well-characterized NAAs , showed strong reactivity with the uncharacterized membrane antigens of live hippocampal neurons. There were no significant differences between seropositive and seronegative patients by means of epilepsy duration , anti-epileptic drug resistance , EE type , types of seizures<symptom> , seizure<symptom> frequencies , EEG features or coexisting autoimmune diseases. Some seropositive patients gave good-moderate response to immunotherapy. Potential clues for the possible role of autoimmunity in seropositive patients with EE were atypical prognosis of the classical EE type , atypical progression and unusual neurological findings like dyskinesia.
