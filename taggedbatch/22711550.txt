 While transgenerational plasticity may buffer ectotherms to warming and pesticides separately , it remains unknown how combined exposure to warming and pesticides in the parental generation shapes the vulnerability to these stressors in the offspring. We studied the transgenerational effects of single and combined exposure to warming ( 4 Â°C increase) and the pesticide chlorpyrifos on life-history traits of the vector mosquito
