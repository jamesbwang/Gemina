 The aim of the present study was to investigate more colon cancer-related genes in different stages. Gene expression profile E-GEOD-62932 was extracted for differentially expressed gene ( DEG) screening. Series test of cluster analysis was used to obtain significant trending models. Based on the Gene Ontology and Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases , functional and pathway enrichment analysis were processed and a pathway relation network was constructed. Gene co-expression network and gene signal network were constructed for common DEGs. The DEGs with the same trend were clustered and in total , 16 clusters with statistical significance were obtained. The screened DEGs were enriched into small molecule metabolic process and metabolic pathways. The pathway relation network was constructed with 57 nodes. A total of 328 common DEGs were obtained. Gene signal network was constructed with 71 nodes. Gene co-expression network was constructed with 161 nodes and 211 edges. ABCD3 , CPT2 , AGL and JAM2 are potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of colon cancer.
