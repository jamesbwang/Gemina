 Acquired immune deficiency syndrome<disease><symptom> ( AIDS) was first labelled as a new illness in 1981; it took two more years to discover a causative virus , which was named human<pathogen><disease> immunodeficiency<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) in 1985. Nurses who practised during those times may recall the fear , panic , stigma , ethical dilemmas and refusals to care that were associated with the pandemic. Four decades later , HIV<pathogen> can be considered a long-term condition rather than a life-limiting disease , as a result of developments in treatment. However , the UK has the highest number of people living with the virus since the pandemic was first identified , and there remains a need to challenge stigma and prejudice in relation to HIV<pathogen> and AIDS , to ensure that people receive timely access to HIV<pathogen> testing , treatment and preventive measures. This article explores the role of nurses in all areas of practice in preventing onward transmission of HIV<pathogen> , providing treatment and patient education , and promoting the well-being of people living with HIV<pathogen>.
