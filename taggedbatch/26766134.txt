 Dysregulation of plasma lipids is associated with age-related cardiovascular diseases. L5 , the most electronegative subfraction of chromatographically resolved low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) , induces endothelial dysfunction , whereas the least electronegative subfraction , L1 , does not. In this study , we examined the effects of L5 on endothelial senescence and its underlying mechanisms. C57B6/J mice were intravenously injected with L5 or L1 ( 2 mg kg
