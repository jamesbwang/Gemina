 Slow waves recorded with EEG in NREM sleep are indicative of the strength and spatial extent of synchronized firing in neuronal assemblies of the cerebral cortex. Slow waves often appear in the A1 part of the cyclic alternating patterns ( CAP) , which correlate with a number of behavioral and biological parameters , but their physiological significance is not adequately known. We automatically detected slow waves from the scalp recordings of 37 healthy patients , visually identified CAP A1 events and compared slow waves during CAP A1 with those during NCAP. For each slow wave , we computed the amplitude , slopes , frequency , synchronization ( synchronization likelihood) between specific cortical areas , as well as the location of origin and scalp propagation of individual waves. CAP A1 slow waves were characterized by greater spatial extent and amplitude , steeper slopes and greater cortical synchronization , but a similar prominence in frontal areas and similar propagation patterns to other areas on the scalp. Our results indicate that CAP A1 represents a period of highly synchronous neuronal firing over large areas of the cortical mantle. This feature may contribute to the role CAP A1 plays in both normal synaptic homeostasis and in the generation of epileptiform phenomena in epileptic patients.
