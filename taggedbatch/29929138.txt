 Thrombosis is the prognostic factor with the greatest effect on survival in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH) , who lack dozens of membrane surface proteins. We recently described a primary homozygous Cys89Tyr congenital nonfunctioning CD59 in humans with clinical manifestation in infancy , associated with chronic hemolysis<symptom> , recurrent strokes , and relapsing peripheral demyelinating neuropathy. Here we investigated hypercoagulability mechanisms characterizing the syndrome<disease><symptom>. Membrane attack complex ( MAC) deposition ( anti-SC5b-9) and free hemoglobin ( colorimetric assay) were assessed. Platelet activation was identified ( anti-CD61 , anti-CD62P) , and microparticles ( MPs) of 0.5-0.9 Î¼m , were characterized ( Annexin V , anti-human GlyA , anti-CD15 , anti-CD14 , anti-CD61). Platelet-monocyte aggregation was assessed with FlowSight. 2/7 patients ( 29 %) with homozygosity for Cys89Tyr and 6/12 ( 50 %) with any of four described CD59 mutations had recurrent strokes. In plasma samples from four patients carrying identical mutations , MAC deposition was increased on RBCs ( p < 0.0003) , neutrophils ( p < 0.009) , and platelets ( p < 0.0003). Free-plasma hemoglobin levels were abnormally high , up to 100 mg/dl. Patients with CD59 mutation had RBC-derived MP levels 9-fold higher than those in healthy controls ( p < 0.01) , and 2-2.5 fold higher than PNH patients ( p < 0.09). Leukocyte-activated platelet aggregation was increased ( p < 0.0062). Loss of CD59 was shown in the endothelium of these patients. Nonfunctioning CD59 is a major risk factor for stroke and hypercoagulability. Uncontrolled hemolysis<symptom> causes massive MP release and endothelial heme damage. MAC attack on unprotected endothelium and platelet activation and aggregation with leukocytes mediate additional mechanisms leading to vascular occlusion. It is suggested that CD59 loss represents a major arterial prothrombotic factor in PNH and additional diseases.
