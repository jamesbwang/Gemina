 Elderly , multi-morbid patients are at high risk for suffering adverse drug events. Safe medication management is a key process in preventing these adverse events , and requires interprofessional teamwork. We performed a needs assessment survey of graduating medical students and faculty to evaluate student training in medication management , in particular students ' preparedness in the three minimum geriatrics competencies pertaining to medication management , interprofessional educational opportunities , and optimal learning methods. Response rates were 45/105 ( 43 %) for students and 38/93 ( 41 %) for faculty. The majority of students felt that they did not receive sufficient training in medication management in older adults. Faculty either agreed with students or were unsure whether students received sufficient training. Neither students nor faculty felt that students were extremely prepared to carry out the three minimum geriatrics competencies at the time of medical school graduation. Students and faculty identified direct patient care experiences as the optimal learning method , and inappropriate medications as the highest priority topic. Students and faculty felt that students do not receive sufficient interprofessional educational opportunities. The results of this study are currently being used to create customized interprofessional educational experiences for medical students related to medication management in older adults.
