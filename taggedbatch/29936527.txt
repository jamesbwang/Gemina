 The prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis ( AIT) , as the most common autoimmune disease ( AD) and papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC) is steadily rising in children. The aim of this study was to determine the coexistence of other AD and thyroid carcinoma ( TC) in AIT. The cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary center comprised AIT children ( < 19 years). Data on age/sex , thyroid function and ultrasound , autoantibodies , associated AD , familial occurence of AD and the occurence of TC for each child were collected. In total , 231 eligible patients ( 77 % females) were included. The most common onset ( 66 %) was during adolescence. At onset , hypothyroidism was detected in 59.3 %; hashitoxicosis in 1.3 %. The positivity of both autoantibodies was present in 60.6 % , the negativity was in 3,5 %. We confirmed a high frequency ( 44.6 %) of AD with AIT predominance in parents and/or grandparents of patients and in siblings ( 7.4 %). 15.2 % had at least 1 comorbid AD , of which type 1 diabetes mellitus was the most common ( 8.5 %). Over a period of 7 years TC was diagnosed in 16 patients ( mean age 13.5 years) with predominance of PTC in 15 ( 94 %) patients. AIT had concurrently 69 % patients. 56 % of patients had metastases ( 89 % in AIT subjects). An invasive PTC was present in 44 % ( 86 % in AIT subjects). The prevalence rate of AD in AIT and first-degree relatives is high , and several new associations have been reported. Providers should be aware of comorbidities and TC in AIT as this would help in early diagnoses and timely interventions.
