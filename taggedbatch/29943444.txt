 Polymerization-induced self-assembly ( PISA) is a powerful and versatile technique for the synthesis of a wide range of sterically stabilized diblock copolymer nano-objects. Recently , PISA has been used to prepare epoxy-functional diblock copolymer worms and spheres directly in aqueous solution by incorporating glycidyl methacrylate ( GlyMA) into the core-forming hydrophobic block. Herein , the synthesis of diblock copolymer spheres via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer ( RAFT) aqueous emulsion polymerization of benzyl methacrylate is examined , in which the epoxy groups are exclusively located within a non-ionic poly ( glycerol monomethacrylate)- based stabilizer block. Two synthetic strategies are explored: i) using an epoxy-functional RAFT chain transfer agent ( CTA) to place an epoxy group at the terminus of every stabilizer block and ii) incorporation of â‰ˆ 1 epoxy group per stabilizer chain via copolymerization of GlyMA with glycerol monomethacrylate ( GMA). The epoxy groups conferred by the GlyMA comonomer are significantly more resistant to hydrolysis than those introduced using the epoxy-functional RAFT CTA. The epoxy-functional nanoparticles are subsequently reacted with various water-soluble thiols to modify their electrophoretic behavior. Such nanoparticles are expected to offer potential applications in the context of mucoadhesion.
