 We investigated the prognostic value of distant metastasis sites among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC) and the significance of metastasectomy and resection of the primary CRC. Between 2010 and 2014 , patients diagnosed with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma were selected using the surveillance , epidemiology , and end results ( SEER) database. The prognosis of these patients was compared according to the site of metastasis ( liver , lung , bone , and brain). A total of 15,133 patients suffered from isolated organ involvement , while 5135 patients experienced multiple<symptom> organ metastases. In the isolated organ metastasis cohort , median overall survival ( OS) for patients with liver , lung , bone , and brain metastases was 16 , 20 , 7 , and 5 months , respectively. Patients with isolated lung metastases had better cancer-specific survival ( CSS) and OS as compared to patients with metastases at any other sites ( p < 0.0001 for both CSS and OS). Patients with isolated liver metastases had better prognosis as compared to patients with isolated bone or brain metastases ( p < 0.0001 for both CSS and OS). Moreover , patients with a single metastatic site had better prognosis than patients with multiple<symptom> organs involved ( p < 0.0001 for both CSS and OS). Multivariate analysis in patients with isolated organ metastases demonstrated that age â‰¤ 60 years , rectal cancer , being married , non-black race , N0 stage , and surgery of the primary and distant lesions<symptom> showed more favorable prognosis. The metastatic site was an independent prognostic factor in stage IV colorectal cancer. Also , carefully chosen patients may benefit from surgery.
