 An overview is given on some of the main advances in experimental methods , experimental results and theoretical models and ideas of the last years in the field of nuclear fission. &#13; New approaches extended the availability of fissioning systems for experimental studies of nuclear fission considerably and provided a full identification of all fission products in A and Z for the first time. &#13; In particular , the transition from symmetric to asymmetric fission around &#13; 226Th and some unexpected structure in the mass distributions in the fission of systems around Z = 80 to 84 as well as an extended systematics of the odd-even effect in fission fragment Z distributions have been measured ( A. N. Andreyev et al. , Rep. Progr. Phys. 81 ( 2018) 016301). &#13; Three classes of model descriptions of fission presently appear to be the most promising or the most successful ones: &#13; Self-consistent quantum-mechanical models fully consider the quantum-mechanical features of the fission process. Intense efforts are presently made to develop suitable theoretical tools ( N. Schunck , L. M. Robledo , Rep. Prog. Phys. 79 ( 2016) 116301) for modeling the non-equilibrium , large-amplitude collective motion leading to fission. &#13; Stochastic models provide a fully developed technical framework. The main features of the fission-fragment mass distribution are well reproduced from mercury to fermium and beyond ( P. M \ `` oller , J. Randrup , Phys. Rev. C 91 ( 2015) 044316). However , the limited computer resources still impose restrictions , for example on the number of collective coordinates and on an elaborate description of the fission dynamics. &#13; In an alternative semi-empirical approach ( K.-H. Schmidt et al. , Nucl. Data Sheets 131 ( 2016) 107) , considerable progress in describing the fission observables has been achieved by combining several theoretical ideas , which are essentially well known. &#13; This approach exploits &#13; ( i) the topological properties of a continuous function in multidimensional space , &#13; ( ii) the separability of the influences of fragment shells and macroscopic properties of the compound nucleus , &#13; ( iii) the properties of a quantum oscillator coupled to the heat bath of other nuclear degrees of freedom , &#13; ( iv) an early freeze-out of collective motion , and &#13; ( v) the application of statistical mechanics for describing the thermalization of intrinsic excitations in the nascent fragments. &#13; This new approach reveals a high degree of regularity and allows calculating &#13; high-quality data that are relevant for nuclear technology without &#13; specific adjustment to empirical data of individual systems.
