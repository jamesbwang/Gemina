 To assess if postponing surgery of paediatric supracondylar humerus fractures ( SCHF) without compromised blood circulation to office hours can improve the quality of reduction and pin fixation and decrease complications. In 2004 , night-time ( 0 am to 7 am) surgery was allowed only for children with compromised blood circulation. Number of open reductions , surgeons experience , operation time , quality of reduction ( Baumann angle , anterior humeral line crossing point with capitellum) and pin fixation as well as the number of complications were compared in 100 children before ( A) and 100 after ( B) the new protocol. Surgery was commenced during office hours ( 8 am to 3 pm) in 27 % ( A) Open reduction was performed in eight ( A) No statistical difference in quality of reduction or pin fixation or in number of complications was observed. Postponing operative treatment of SCHF without vascular compromise increased consultant attendance in operations and decreased operative room time. III- retrospective comparative study.
