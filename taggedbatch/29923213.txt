 Commercially available microchip-automated devices for companion animals also have potential application with captive wildlife. To explore this potential , a captive bridled nailtail wallaby was trained to use a SureFlap Microchip Pet Door. Throughout the 62 day study the wallaby 's interactions with the door increased in frequency and intensity , culminating in the repeated use of the microchip-automated door. This was the first record of any captive macropod being trained to use a microchip-automated device and demonstrates proof-of-concept that captive macropods can successfully utilize commercially available microchip-automated devices. Further research is recommended to develop methodology and evaluation techniques for training captive macropods while also exploring intra- and inter-species variations in responses.
