 N-heterocyclic carbene ( NHC) ligands have had a major impact in homogeneous catalysis , however , their potential role in biological systems is essentially unexplored. We replaced a copper-coordinating histidine ( His) in the active site of the redox enzyme azurin with exogenous dimethyl imidazolylidene. This NHC rapidly restores the type-1 Cu center , with spectroscopic properties ( EPR , UV/Vis) that are identical to those from N-coordination of the His in the wild type. However , the introduction of the NHC markedly alters the redox potential of the metal , which is a key functionality of this blue copper protein. These results suggest that C-bonding for histidine is plausible and a potentially relevant bonding mode of redox-active metalloenzymes in their ( transient) active states.
