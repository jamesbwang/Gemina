 Lysophospholipid signaling is emerging as a druggable regulator of pathophysiological responses , and especially fibrosis<disease> , exemplified by the relative ongoing clinical trials in idiopathic pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( IPF) patients. In this review , we focus on ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase-phosphodiesterase 2 ( ENPP2) , or as more widely known Autotaxin ( ATX) , a secreted lysophospholipase D ( lysoPLD) largely responsible for extracellular lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA) production. In turn , LPA is a bioactive phospholipid autacoid , forming locally upon increased ATX levels and acting also locally through its receptors , likely guided by ATX 's structural conformation and cell surface associations. Increased ATX activity levels have been detected in many inflammatory and fibroproliferative conditions , while genetic and pharmacologic studies have confirmed a pleiotropic participation of ATX/LPA in different processes and disorders. In pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> , ATX levels rise in the broncheoalveolar fluid ( BALF) and stimulate LPA production. LPA engagement of its receptors activate multiple G-protein mediated signal transduction pathways leading to different responses from pulmonary cells including the production of pro-inflammatory signals from stressed epithelial cells , the modulation of endothelial physiology , the activation of TGF signaling and the stimulation of fibroblast accumulation. Genetic or pharmacologic targeting of the ATX/LPA axis attenuated disease development in animal models , thus providing the proof of principle for therapeutic interventions.
