 Low-flow ischemia ( LFI) is consequent to coronary disease and produces cardiac stunning during reperfusion ( R). Energetic performance and mechanisms of Ca Rat ventricles were perfused inside a calorimeter to measure maximal pressure development ( P) and total heat rate ( Ht) before and during exposition to LFI/R. The mechanisms of stunning were evaluated with selective drugs. Female hearts ( FH) developed higher postischemic contractile recovery ( PICR) and muscle economy ( P/Ht) than males ( MH). Cardioprotection was sensitive to blockade of mKATP channels , UCam and NOS. Perfusion of 20 μmol/l Gen reduced PICR and P/Ht during LFI/R in FH , and dysfunction was increased by mNCX blockade with mPTP opening. However , intraperitoneal 5 mg/kg Gen ( Gen-ip) was cardioprotective in both sexes , and the beneficial effect of Gen-ip was blocked by 100 μmol/l 5-HD. FH are more protected than MH against the LFI/R dysfunction , which involves mitochondrial Ca
