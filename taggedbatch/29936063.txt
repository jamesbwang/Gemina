 IMAB362 ( Zolbetuximab) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds to Claudin-18.2 , a target antigen specific to cancer cells. In vitro , IMAB362 mediates cell death through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity; thus , IMAB362 may serve as a potent , targeted immunotherapeutic agent. This first-in-human phase I study enroled adult patients ( N = 15) with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer into five sequential single dose-escalation cohorts ( 33 , 100 , 300 , 600 , and 1000 mg/m IMAB362 was generally well tolerated at all doses , with gastrointestinal toxicities being the most commonly observed treatment-related adverse events. As dose-limiting toxicity was not observed within 4 weeks of treatment , a maximum tolerated dose was not established. The pharmacokinetic profile of IMAB362 appeared to be proportional across the dose range; and mean half-life ranged from 13 to 24 d. While most patients showed progressive disease at weeks 4-5 after a single intravenous IMAB362 infusion , one patient in the 600 mg/m Findings from this study demonstrate that IMAB362 is generally well tolerated and support further evaluation in patients with gastric/gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.
