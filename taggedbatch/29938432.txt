 Cancer of the breast is the leading female cancer accounting for one fourth of the malignancies. The tumour remains the most researched , read and practiced upon around the Globe. The treatment has substantially improved breast cancer related outcomes , both for early as well as late stages with substantial improvements in disease free and overall survival. Therapeutic decisions not only rest on clinical & tumour characteristics , but also with the evolution of molecular biology and tissue microarray intrinsic sub-types have been found. Attempts are being made to translate therapy from genomic architecture of individual breast cancer. This facilitates customization of treatment avoiding un-necessary toxicity , costs and inconvenience. Optimizing treatment based on individual breast biology seems logical and allows unifying treatment. The paper reviews literature , incorporate updates and also describes immunohistochemistry based molecular classification: which are found simple to adapt , record , present and subsequently manage , summarizing clinical practices in management of these patients.
