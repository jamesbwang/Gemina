 A one-pot hydrothermal approach has been developed to introduce tetraethylene glycol ( TEG) molecules into a two-dimensional ( 2D) layered lanthanide metal-organic framework ( ( Sm ( H5C2P2O7) ( H2O) 2) · Guest , denoted SmHEDP-Guest). Through the straightforward loading of TEG , the proton conductivity of SmHEDP-TEG ( 1.21 × 10-3 S cm-1) is increased by 3 orders of magnitude compared with its analogue SmHEDP-H2O ( 1.22 × 10-6 S cm-1) under 100 % relative humidity at room temperature. More excitingly , SmHEDP-TEG exhibits very high proton conductivity of 9.17 × 10-2 S cm-1 , even higher than commercial Nafion , when the temperature is increased to 333 K , which is significantly higher than SmHEDP-H2O ( 3.38 × 10-5 S cm-1). The single crystal XRD reveals that the adjacent water molecules located in the channels of SmHEDP-H2O are isolated without hydrogen bonding interactions owing to their long distances. However , interestingly , the guest TEG molecules of SmHEDP-TEG behave as hydrogen bonded connected bridges , which switch on the proton transport pathway to promote proton hopping. This discovery may provide a facile strategy to design and synthesize more promising candidates for novel proton conductors.
