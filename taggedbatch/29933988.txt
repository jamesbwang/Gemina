 The antibacterial mechanism of Yanglingmycin , a new dihydrooxazole antibiotic , was preliminarily investigated by symptomatology observation and physical and biochemical analysis. The electron microscopy observation exhibited that the bacterial cell became elongated , appeared breakage or even cavities on the cell surface after treated with Yanglingmycin. The content of reducing sugar and the activity levels of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase in treated group had a significant increase compared to control group. These results indicated that the integrity of bacteria cell membrane was damaged by the antibiotic. Furthermore , the activity of Accase and carboxyltransferase could be effectively inhibited by Yanglingmycin. Meanwhile , the addition of exogenous fatty acid resulted in the decrease or even loss of the antibacterial activity of Yanglingmycin. These findings implied that Yanglingmycin might take effect by inhibiting the activity of Accase , which resulted in the blockade of fatty acids and lipids biosynthesis.
