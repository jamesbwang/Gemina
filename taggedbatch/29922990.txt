 Chemotherapy dosing in neonates represents a major clinical challenge because of a lack of clinical pharmacology information in this patient population. In this study , we investigate the use of cisplatin dose adaptation based on therapeutic drug monitoring in a 2-week-old neonate with localized hepatoblastoma. Cisplatin concentrations were determined in plasma and ultrafiltrate samples collected on each of six cycles of a monotherapy regimen , beginning with a dose of 1.6 mg/kg at 16 days of age. Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed to generate clearance ( CL) and area under the curve ( AUC The first cisplatin dose ( 1.6 mg/kg) resulted in an AUC Our study provides useful data on the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin monotherapy in neonates treated within the first few weeks of life. These data provide a reference point to support clinicians in determining appropriate dosing regimens for neonates and support the implementation of therapeutic drug monitoring in such challenging patients.
