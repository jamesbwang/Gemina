 The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of combination therapy with intravenously injected microglia ( MI) and radiotherapy ( RT) for rat malignant glioma. Transgenic rats expressing v-erbB and spontaneously developing malignant glioma were used. The rats were divided into four groups: control ( n = 19) , RT alone ( n = 10) , MI alone ( n = 9) , and combination of MI and RT ( MI+RT) ( n = 10). Cranial X-ray irradiation ( 8 Gy per fraction; once per week) was performed at 50 and 51 weeks of age. Cultured rat microglial cells ( 5 Ã— 10 No evidence of side effects including thrombosis or graft-versus-host disease was noted. Rats treated with RT alone , MI alone , MI+RT , and control survived 60.9 , 56.3 , 66.0 , and 56.1 weeks , respectively. The survival period of MI+RT was significantly longer than that of control ( p = 0.014) , MI alone ( p = 0.027) , and RT alone ( p = 0.049). Immunohistochemical analysis showed significantly higher number of tumor-infiltrated microglia in the RT alone ( p = 0.041) and MI+RT groups ( p = 0.014) compared with the control. Significantly more CD8-positive lymphocytes were observed in the MI+RT group ( p = 0.049) compared with the control. A positive correlation was found between the number of microglia and CD8-positive lymphocytes ( R MI+RT increased infiltrated microglia and CD8-positive T cells and prolonged the survival in transgenic rats spontaneously developing malignant glioma. Combined immunocellular therapy and RT may provide a novel treatment strategy for malignant glioma.
