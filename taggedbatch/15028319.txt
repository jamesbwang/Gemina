 Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans ( DFSP) is a rare neoplasm which represents < 0.1 % of all tumors but it is considered the most common skin sarcoma<disease>. It is a slow-growing tumor that arises from the dermis and invades deeper tissues. The precise origin of DFSP is not well known. It is most frequently seen on the trunk , extremities , and head and neck. The standard treatment of the localized huge DFSP consists of a wide local surgical resection with recommended surgical margins of 2-3 cm. Local recurrence after incomplete excision is common. We present a case of 35-year-old man with enormous bulky mass on the face. Upon histological examination , the diagnosis of DFSP was made , and the patient underwent en bloc wide local excision of the mass followed by the use of Trapezius musculocutaneous pedicle flap reconstruction. On 32 months follow-up , no recurrence has been reported.
