 Recombinant human interferon beta ( rhIFN-β) is a glycoprotein produced by genetically engineered cells and has anti-virus , anti-tumor and immunoregulation functions. Although studies have shown that other subtypes of IFN such as IFN-γ affects cell proliferation and differentiation to some extent , the effect of rhIFN-β on chondrogenic differentiation of human bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs) is less known. In this study we studied the effect of rhIFN-β on the chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs by inducing hMSCs into cartilage pellet via adding IFN-β1a into regular TGF-β3 chondrogenic differentiation medium. We collected the induced pellets and then detected GAG content , assessed pellets size , observed agreecan using alcian blue staining , and analyzed the expression of Sox and CollangenⅡusing real-time PCR and Western blotting. Addition of 100 ng/mL IFN-β1a to regular TGF-β3 chondrogenic differentiation medium could improve the concentration of GAG , increase the size of pellets , promote the formation of aggrecan and up-regulate the expression of CollangenII and Sox9. IFN-β1a combined with TGF-β3 could promote chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs.
