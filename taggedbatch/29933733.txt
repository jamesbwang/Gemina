 Rotavirus<pathogen> is the most common agent of acute<symptom> gastroenteritis<disease><symptom> in children under five years of age and still a major cause of mortality and morbidity mainly in devoloping countries. The aim of this study was to determine the circulating rotavirus<pathogen> genotypes in children less than five years of age with acute<symptom> gastroenteritis<disease><symptom> in Adana province , before the introduction of the rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine into the national immunization programme. Fecal specimens were collected from children enrolled between December 2012 and November 2016 and rotavirus<pathogen> antigen was searched by a rapid immunochromatographic test method. The antigen positive samples were G and Pgenotyped by hemi-nested type-specific multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR). Rotavirus<pathogen> antigen positive fecal specimens from 201 patients of 107 ( 53.3 %) boys and 94 ( 46.8 %) girls were included in this study. Rotavirus<pathogen> infection was most frequently detected in patients with gastroenteritis<disease><symptom> between the ages of 12 and 23 months. It has been determined that 45 % of rotavirus<pathogen> gastroenteritis<disease><symptom> was determined in children under two years of age. Rotavirus<pathogen> gastroenteritis<disease><symptom> was more frequent between September and April , but the highest incidence was detected in January. Of 201 rotavirus<pathogen> antigen-positive stool<symptom> specimens , 167 were PCR positive. Five common G ( G1 , G2 , G3 , G4 and G9) and two common P genotypes ( P ( 8) and P ( 4)) were determined as 91.6 % and 96.4 % of the isolates , respectively. The most prevalent G and P genotype combination was G1P8 with a frequency of 29.9 % , followed by 21 % G9P8 About 78 % of rotavirus<pathogen> isolates were classified into five common G-P combination genotypes , including G1P8 , G9P8 G3P8 , G2P4 , and G2P8. During the study period , there were significant changes in the distribution of rotavirus<pathogen> genotype. The prevalence of G9P8 genotype sharply decreased from 40 % to 8.1 % and the prevalence of G1P8 genotype increased from 21.3 % to 48.6 %. Although no G3P8 isolates were detected in the first two years of the study , this genotype was detected in 18.5 % and 13.5 % of the samples in 2015 and 2016 , respectively. There were no relationship between the age onset of the disease , sex , dehydration<symptom> development risk and rotavirus<pathogen> genotype. The results from this study indicated that the predominant circulating strains of rotavirus<pathogen> determined in clinical specimens were G1P8 and G9P8. Significant changes were observed in the prevalence of the most common rotavirus<pathogen> isolates over the years. Rotavirus<pathogen> surveillance is important to determine the circulating strains of rotavirus<pathogen> to assess vaccine effectiveness , to monitor vaccine failures , and to detect potential emerging strains.
