 Adductomics is expected to be useful in the characterization of the exposome , which is a new paradigm for studying the sum of environmental causes of diseases. DNA adductomics is emerging as a powerful method for detecting DNA adducts , but reliable assays for its widespread , routine use are currently lacking. We propose a novel integrated strategy for the establishment of a DNA adductomic approach , using liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-QqQ-MS/MS) , operating in constant neutral loss scan mode , screening for both known and unknown DNA adducts in a single injection. The LC-QqQ-MS/MS was optimized using a representative sample of 23 modified 2 '- deoxyribonucleosides reflecting a range of biologically relevant DNA lesions<symptom>. Six internal standards ( ISTDs) were evaluated for their ability to normalize , and hence correct , possible variation in peak intensities arising from matrix effects , and the quantities of DNA injected. The results revealed that , with appropriate ISTDs adjustment , any bias can be dramatically reduced from 370 to 8.4 %. Identification of the informative DNA adducts was achieved by triggering fragmentation spectra of target ions. The LC-QqQ-MS/MS method was successfully applied to in vitro and in vivo studies to screen for DNA adducts formed following representative environmental exposures: methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS) and five N-nitrosamines. Interestingly , five new DNA adducts , induced by MMS , were discovered using our adductomic approach-an added strength. The proposed integrated strategy provides a path forward for DNA adductomics to become a standard method to discover differences in DNA adduct fingerprints between populations exposed to genotoxins , and facilitate the field of exposomics.
