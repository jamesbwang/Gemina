 The aim of the study was to characterize third molars that have remained disease-free in a representative sample of the Finnish population aged 30 years and older. Two-staged stratified cluster sampling ( N = 8028) was used , and 6005 subjects participated in a clinical oral examination and panoramic radiography. Disease-free third molars were characterized as follows: no dentinal caries<disease> , no filling , periodontal pocket depths of neighboring second molars less than 4 mm , and no radiographic pathological findings. Logistic regression analyses served for assessment of the strength of characteristics of third molars for disease-free status. Of the subjects , 2653 ( 44 %) had at least one third molar. Of them , the majority ( 62 %) had only diseased third molars , 16 % had only disease-free ones , and 22 % had both. Participants had in total 5665 third molars; 29 % of them were disease-free. Female gender , higher level of education , and younger age were related to disease-free status ( P < 0.001). Disease-free status was more likely for third molars at cervical or apical level than at occlusal level: odds ratio was 10.1 for all teeth , 8.5 for maxillary teeth , and 6.2 for mandibular teeth. A third molar situated deeper in the bone was more likely to be disease-free than a tooth at occlusal level in the population aged 30 years and older. Our results suggest that the number of disease-free third molars decreased with increasing age , and most dramatically , this occurred among teeth at cervical level with the neighboring second molar.
