 The rates of obesity continue to increase in the United States and the overall impact of obesity on health care spending and patient outcomes after trauma is considerable. The unique physiology of the obese places them at higher risk for complications , including infection , failure of fixation , nonunion , multiorgan failure , and death. These physiologic differences and overall patient size can make orthopedic care in obese patients with trauma more difficult , but appropriate initial resuscitation , careful preoperative planning , meticulous surgical technique , diligent postoperative medical management , and specialized rehabilitation give these patients their best opportunity for a good outcome.
