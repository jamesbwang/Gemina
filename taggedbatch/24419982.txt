 The varicella zoster<disease> virus ( VZV) is a neurotropic virus that becomes latent in the sensory ganglia , but later causes various neurologic complications such as meningitis<disease><symptom> , encephalitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> , myelitis , meningoencephalitis<disease><symptom> , cranial neuropathy , and peripheral neuropathy ( 1). While acute cerebellitis is one of the most frequent acute cerebellar diseases associated with VZV in childhood , VZV rarely causes cerebellitis in adults , with or without skin manifestations , and only a few isolated cases of adult VZV cerebellitis have been reported. We report a case of acute cerebellitis associated with VZV infection after a herpetic<symptom> rash<symptom> in an 80-year-old male. Functional imaging of his cerebellum showed high blood perfusion during the acute stage of the disease , though perfusion decreased in the subacute stage.
