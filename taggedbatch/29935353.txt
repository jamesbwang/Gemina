 Analyzing phylogenetic relationships using mathematical methods has always been of importance in bioinformatics. Quantitative research may interpret the raw biological data in a precise way. Multiple Sequence Alignment ( MSA) is used frequently to analyze biological evolutions , but is very time-consuming. When the scale of data is large , alignment methods can not finish calculation in reasonable time. Therefore , we present a new method using moments of cumulative Fourier power spectrum in clustering the DNA sequences. Each sequence is translated into a vector in Euclidean space. Distances between the vectors can reflect the relationships between sequences. The mapping between the spectra and moment vector is one-to-one , which means that no information is lost in the power spectra during the calculation. We cluster and classify several datasets including Influenza<pathogen><disease> A<pathogen> , primates , and human rhinovirus<pathogen> ( HRV) datasets to build up the phylogenetic trees. Results show that the new proposed cumulative Fourier power spectrum is much faster and more accurately than MSA and another alignment-free method known as k-mer. The research provides us new insights in the study of phylogeny , evolution , and efficient DNA comparison algorithms for large genomes. The computer programs of the cumulative Fourier power spectrum are available at GitHub ( https://github.com/YaulabTsinghua/cumulative-Fourier-power-spectrum).
