 Nurse leaders , educators and employers work to address the challenges of providing optimal care to Indigenous people and communities in Canada , which is often further complicated by geography and isolation. The Canadian Indigenous Nurses Association ( CINA) has responded to the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada through partnerships with various levels of government , including the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch of the new federal department of Indigenous Services Canada , to increase and better support Indigenous nurses in the healthcare system. Grounding nursing practice with the wisdom and strength of Indigenous knowledge , balanced with the perspectives of western ways of knowing is further facilitated when nursing students can be educated and supported closer to home. Learning in a supportive way , closer to where one lives , can allow for important family ties , cultural supports and practices to improve experiences and outcomes for students.
