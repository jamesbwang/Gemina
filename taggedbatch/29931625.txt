 The paper aims to discuss how school psychology broadly is influenced by neoliberalism. Neoliberalism has attracted great attention among sociologists and economist , but less so among psychologists. This is a paradox since the psychological reach of neoliberalism is massive. The paper analyzes how new ( neoliberal) school reforms place new professional demands on schools and therefore also new kinds of professional demands on school psychologists. Among other things , it is discussed whether the notion of resilience can act as a future guiding principle for school psychologists. The paper concludes with three suggestions as to how school psychologists can cope with some of the challenges imposed by neoliberalism. I suggest that school psychologists; 1) have to start asking educational questions to educational matters , 2) that they have to be aware of the political aspects of school psychology and 3) that they start acting against the corrosion of professional identity.
