 About four decades ago , the relationship between dialysis-dementia and aluminum ( Al) began to be established. The restriction of drugs containing Al and improvements on water quality used for dialysis resulted in the clinical disappearance of Al intoxication. However , high prevalence of Al deposition in bone tissue from Brazilian dialysis patients is still being detected. Through the case report of a patient on hemodialysis ( HD) for one year , presenting significant Al deposition in bone tissue , we speculated if this problem is not being underestimated. We used extensive investigation to identify potential sources of Al exposure with a careful review of medication history and water quality controls. Al concentration was measured by different methods , including mass spectrometry , in poly-electrolyte concentrate solutions and solution for peritoneal dialysis , in an attempt to elucidate the possible sources of contamination. The objective of this case report is to alert the medical community about a potential high prevalence of Al deposition in bone tissue and to discuss the possible sources of contamination in patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD).
