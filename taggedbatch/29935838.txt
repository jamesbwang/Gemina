 To compare feasibility , 12-month outcome , and periprocedural and postprocedural risks between carotid artery stent ( CAS) placement and carotid endarterectomy ( CEA) performed within 1 week after transient ischemic attack ( TIA) or mild to severe stroke onset in a single comprehensive stroke center. Retrospective analysis of prospective data collected from 1,148 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to a single stroke unit between January 2013 and July 2015 was conducted. Among 130 consecutive patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis , 110 ( 10 with TIA , 100 with stroke) with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS) score < 20 and a prestroke modified Rankin Scale ( mRS) score < 2 were eligible for CAS placement or CEA and treated according to the preference of the patient or a surrogate. Periprocedural ( < 48 h) and postprocedural complications , functional outcome , stroke , and death rate up to 12 months were analyzed. Sixty-two patients were treated with CAS placement and 48 were treated with CEA. Several patients presented with moderate or major stroke ( 45.8 % CEA , 64.5 % CAS). NIHSS scores indicated slightly greater severity at onset in patients treated with a CAS vs CEA ( 6.6 ± 5.7 vs 4.2 ± 3.4; P = .08). Complication rates were similar between groups. mRS scores showed a significant improvement over time and a significant interaction with age in both groups. Similar incidences of death or stroke were shown on survival analysis. A subanalysis in patients with NIHSS scores ≥ 4 showed no differences in complication rate and outcome. CAS placement and CEA seem to offer early safe and feasible secondary stroke prevention treatments in experienced centers , even after major atherosclerotic stroke.
