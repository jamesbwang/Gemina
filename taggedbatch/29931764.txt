 This study of spotted snakehead Channa punctata was aimed to develop a comprehensive understanding of testicular gonadotropin receptors , from their sequence characterization , temporal expression to gonadotropic regulation , in seasonally breeding teleosts. A single form of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor ( cpfshra) and luteinizing hormone-choriogonadotropin receptor ( cplhcgr) , was identified from testicular transcriptome data of C. punctata. Although deduced full-length protein sequence for cpFshra ( 694 amino acids) and cpLhcgr ( 691 amino acids) showed homology with their counterparts of other vertebrates , multiple insertion-deletion-substitution of residues suggest marked alterations in their structure and ligand specificity. The absolute quantification of testicular cpfshra and cplhcgr was estimated along the reproductive cycle following real-time PCR. The temporal expression profile showed highest testicular expression of both the gonadotropin receptors during resting phase. Their expression progressively decreased during preparatory and spawning phases concomitant with spermatogonial proliferation and differentiation and spermiogenesis. However , levels of cpfshra and cplhcgr sharply increased during post-spawning when seminiferous lobules were largely devoid of germ cells. To explore gonadotropic regulation of testicular cpfshra and cplhcgr , one group of fish of resting phase was administered with single dose of human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG; 5000 IU kg
