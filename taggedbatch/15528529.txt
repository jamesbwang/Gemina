 Climate change scenarios predict a higher variability in rainfall and an increased risk of water deficits during summers for the coming decades. For this reason , arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> ( AMF) and their mitigating effects on drought stress in plants are increasingly considered in crop management. However , the impact of a decrease in water availability on the development of AMF and their ability to take up and transport inorganic phosphorus ( Pi) to their hosts remain poorly explored. Here ,
