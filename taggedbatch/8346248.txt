 Adult T cell Leukemia/Lymphoma ( ATLL) is a mature T cell malignancy associated with Human T cell Leukemia<disease> Virus type 1 ( HTLV-1) infection. Among its four main clinical subtypes , the prognosis of acute and lymphoma variants remains poor. The long latency ( 3-6 decades) and low incidence ( 3-5 %) of ATLL imply the involvement of viral and host factors in full-blown malignancy. Despite multiple preclinical and clinical studies , the contribution of the stromal microenvironment in ATLL development is not yet completely unraveled. The aims of this study were to investigate the role of the host microenvironment , and specifically fibroblasts , in ATLL pathogenesis and to propose a murine model for the lymphoma subtype. Here we present evidence that the oncogenic capacity of HTLV-1-immortalized C91/PL cells is enhanced when they are xenotransplanted together with human foreskin fibroblasts ( HFF) in immunocompromised BALB/c Rag2
