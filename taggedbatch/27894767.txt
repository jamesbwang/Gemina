 Most patients with paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma may typically present as a unilateral , painless palpable scrotum mass. However , only a few cases of RMS presenting as painful<symptom> edema<symptom> of the scrotum mimicing epididymitis<symptom>. We herein report an unusual case of alveolar paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma misdiagnosed as epididymitis<symptom>. A 19-year-old adolescent , presented to urologist with painful<symptom> swelling of the scrotum on the left side over the preceding several days. Antibiotics were administered by physician for two months and the pain improved , but the swelling did not fade. Alveolar praratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma. A left , soft<disease> tissue mass in the scrotum without definite metastasis or lymphadenopathy<disease><symptom> was confirmed by computed tomography ( CT) and magnetic resonance imaging. A radical left orchiectomy via the inguinal approach was performed successfully. The patient received 8 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy , the patient remains recurrence- and metastasis-free at 13 months after surgery. When paratesticular RMS is presenting with symptoms of epididymitis<symptom> , this malignant tumor is usually overlooked. When patients complain of painful scrotal swelling , RMS arise from paratesticular tissue should be considered.
