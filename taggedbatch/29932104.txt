 Anaplastic thyroid cancer ( ATC) is a malignant subtype of thyroid cancers and its mechanism of development remains inconclusive. Importantly , there is no effective strategy for treatment since ATC is not responsive to conventional therapies , including radioactive iodine therapy and thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression. Here , we report that a combinational approach consisting of drugs designed for targeting lipid metabolism , lovastatin ( an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase , HMGCR) and troglitazone ( an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma , PPAR & gamma ;-RRB- , exhibits anti-proliferation in cell culture systems and leads to tumor regression in a mouse xenograft model. The composition contains a sub-lethal concentration of both drugs and exhibits low toxicity to certain types of normal cells. Our results support a hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of the combination is partly through a cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase , as evidenced by the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors , p21
