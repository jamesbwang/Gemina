 At present , transmembrane glycoprotein CD133 highly expressed pancreatic cancer stem cells ( PCSCs) , with the features of chemotherapeutic/radiotherapeutic resistance and exclusive tumorigenic potential , are considered as the primary cause of metastasis and recurrence in pancreatic cancer , and therefore are an effective target in the disease treatment. Furthermore , with the launch of precision medicine , multifunctional nanoprobes have been applied as an efficient strategy for the magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI)- guided photothermal therapy ( PTT) of pancreatic cancer. In this research , with the aim of achieving precise MRI-guided PTT in CD133 highly expressed PCSCs , novel bTiO2-Gd-CD133mAb nanoprobes were designed and successfully prepared by loading Gd-DOTA and CD133 monoclonal antibodies on black TiO2 nanoparticles. It was very interesting to find that the r1 relaxivity value of the nanoprobes was 34.394 mM-1 s-1 , about 7.5 times that of commercial Magnevist ( 4.5624 mM-1 s-1) , which indicates that the nanoprobes have good potential as MRI T1 contrast agents with excellent performance. Herein , CD133 highly expressed PANC-1 cells were selected and verified as PCSCs model. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the nanoprobes exhibited active-targeting ability in PANC-1 cells , and consequently could specially enhance T1-weighted MR imaging and 808 nm near-infrared ( NIR)- triggered PTT efficiency in the PCSCs model. Our study not only provides a new strategy for the effective treatment of pancreatic cancer and its ' stem cells , but also further broadens the application of black TiO2 in the field of cancer theranostics.
