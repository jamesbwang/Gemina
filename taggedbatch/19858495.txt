 In matrix recovery from random linear measurements , one is interested in recovering an unknown M-by-N matrix ( Formula: see text) from ( Formula: see text) measurements ( Formula: see text) , where each ( Formula: see text) is an M-by-N measurement matrix with i.i.d. random entries , ( Formula: see text) We present a matrix recovery algorithm , based on approximate message passing , which iteratively applies an optimal singular-value shrinker-a nonconvex nonlinearity tailored specifically for matrix estimation. Our algorithm typically converges exponentially fast , offering a significant speedup over previously suggested matrix recovery algorithms , such as iterative solvers for nuclear norm minimization ( NNM). It is well known that there is a recovery tradeoff between the information content of the object ( Formula: see text) to be recovered ( specifically , its matrix rank r) and the number of linear measurements n from which recovery is to be attempted. The precise tradeoff between r and n , beyond which recovery by a given algorithm becomes possible , traces the so-called phase transition curve of that algorithm in the ( Formula: see text) plane. The phase transition curve of our algorithm is noticeably better than that of NNM. Interestingly , it is close to the information-theoretic lower bound for the minimal number of measurements needed for matrix recovery , making it not only state of the art in terms of convergence rate , but also near optimal in terms of the matrices it successfully recovers.
