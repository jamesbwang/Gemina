 Parkinson disease ( PD) is one of the most frequent neurodegenerative disorders. The aim of this study was to identify blood biomarkers capable to discriminate PD patients with different progression rates. Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) were acquired by comparing the expression profiles of PD patients with rapid and slow progression rates , using an expression dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO) under accession code of GSE80599. Altered biological processes and pathways were revealed by functional annotation. Potential biomarkers of PD were identified by protein-protein interaction ( PPI) network analysis. Critical transcription factors ( TFs) and miRNAs regulating DEGs were predicted by TF analysis and miRNA analysis. A total of 225 DEGs were identified between PD patients with rapid and slow progression profiles. These genes were significantly enriched in biological processes and pathways related to fatty acid metabolism. Among these DEGs , ZFAND4 , SRMS , UBL4B , PVALB , DIRAS1 , PDP2 , LRCH1 , and MYL4 were potential progression rate associated biomarkers of PD. Additionally , these DEGs may be regulated by miRNAs of the miR-30 family and TFs STAT1 and GRHL3. Our results may contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying different PD progression profiles.
