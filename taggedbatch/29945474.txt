 Maternal smoking during pregnancy may affect newborn DNA methylation ( DNAm). However , little is known about how these associations vary by a newborn 's sex and/or maternal nutrition. To fill in this research gap , we investigated epigenome-wide DNAm associations with maternal smoking during pregnancy in African American mother-newborn pairs. DNAm profiling in cord ( n = 379) and maternal blood ( n = 300) were performed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. We identified 12 CpG sites whose DNAm levels in cord blood were associated with maternal smoking , at a false discovery rate < 5 %. The identified associations in the GFI1 gene were more pronounced in male newborns than in females ( P = 0.002 for maternal smoking × sex interaction at cg18146737). We further observed that maternal smoking and folate level may interactively affect cord blood DNAm level at cg05575921 in the AHRR gene ( P = 5.0 × 10
