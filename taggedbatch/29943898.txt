 Delineating naturally occurring and self-sustaining subpopulations ( stocks) of a species is an important task , especially for species harvested from the wild. Despite its central importance to natural resource management , analytical methods used to delineate stocks are often , and increasingly , borrowed from superficially similar analytical tasks in human genetics even though models specifically for stock identification have been previously developed. Unfortunately , the analytical tasks in resource management and human genetics are not identical-questions about humans are typically aimed at inferring ancestry ( often referred to as `` admixture '') rather than breeding stocks. In this article , we argue , and show through simulation experiments and an analysis of yellowfin tuna data , that ancestral analysis methods are not always appropriate for stock delineation. In this work , we advocate a variant of a previously introduced and simpler model that identifies stocks directly. We also highlight that the computational aspects of the analysis , irrespective of the model , are difficult. We introduce some alternative computational methods and quantitatively compare these methods to each other and to established methods. We also present a method for quantifying uncertainty in model parameters and in assignment probabilities. In doing so , we demonstrate that point estimates can be misleading. One of the computational strategies presented here , based on an expectation-maximization algorithm with judiciously chosen starting values , is robust and has a modest computational cost.
