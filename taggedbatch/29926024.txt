 In this work , using density functional theory we investigated systematically the electronic properties and Schottky barrier modulation in a multilayer graphene/bilayer-GaSe heterostructure by varying the interlayer spacing and by applying an external electric field. At the equilibrium state , the graphene is bound to bilayer-GaSe by a weak van der Waals interaction with the interlayer distance d of 3.40 Å with the binding energy per carbon atom of -37.71 meV. The projected band structure of the graphene/bilayer-GaSe heterostructure appears as a combination of each band structure of graphene and bilayer-GaSe. Moreover , a tiny band gap of about 10 meV is opened at the Dirac point in the graphene/bilayer-GaSe heterostructure due to the sublattice symmetry breaking. The band gap opening in graphene makes it suitable for potential applications in nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices. The graphene/bilayer-GaSe heterostructure forms an n-type Schottky contact with the Schottky barrier height of 0.72 eV at the equilibrium interlayer spacing. Furthermore , a transformation from the n-type to p-type Schottky contact could be performed by decreasing the interlayer distance or by applying an electric field. This transformation is observed when the interlayer distance is smaller than 3.30 Å , or when the applied positive external electric field is larger than 0.0125 V Å-1. These results are very important for designing new electronic Schottky devices based on graphene and other 2D semiconductors such as a graphene/bilayer-GaSe heterostructure.
