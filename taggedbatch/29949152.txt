 Colorectal cancer is a common malignant tumor of the digestive tract. It frequently occurs at the junction of the rectum and sigmoid colon. It is characterized by high mortality and poor prognosis. Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death ( BIM) plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis , and involves in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. The transcription factor forkhead , transcription factor O subfamily 3a ( FoxO3a) plays a role in the regulation of BIM expression and is associated to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that there is a targeted relationship between FoxO3a and microRNA-223 ( miR-223). This study aims to investigate effects of miR-223 on the regulation of FoxO3a/BIM signaling pathway and colorectal cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. Colorectal cancer cell line SW620 and normal colorectal epithelial cell line NCM460 were cultured in vitro. Dual luciferase reporter assay was used to validate the relationship between miR-223 and FoxO3a. Flow cytometry was adopted to detect apoptosis. EdU staining was applied to test cell proliferation. Western blot was selected to determine FoxO3a and BIM protein expressions. There was targeted regulatory relationship between miR-223 and FoxO3a. MiRa-223 up-regulated , FoxO3a and BIM expressions reduced , and cell proliferation was enhanced in SW620 cells compared with NCM460 cells. MiR-223 inhibitor or pIRES2-FoxO3a transfection significantly increased FoxO3a and BIM expressions , attenuated cell proliferation , and enhanced cell apoptosis. MiR-223 targeted inhibited expression of FoxO3. Down-regulating the expression of miR-223 , it increased the expressions of FoxO3a and BIM , weakened SW620 cells proliferation and induced apoptosis.
