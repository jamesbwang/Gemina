 High tibial osteotomy ( HTO) is a relatively conservative surgical option in the management of medial knee pain. Thus far , the outcomes have been variable , and apparently worse than the arthroplasty alternatives when judged using conventional metrics , owing in large part to uncertainty around the extent of the correction planned and achieved.This review paper introduces the concept of detailed 3D planning of the procedure , and describes the 3D printing technology that enables the plan to be performed.The different ways that the osteotomy can be undertaken , and the varying guide designs that enable accurate registration are discussed and described. The system accuracy is reported.In keeping with other assistive technologies , 3D printing enables the surgeon to achieve a preoperative plan with a degree of accuracy that is not possible using conventional instruments. With the advent of low dose CT , it has been possible to confirm that the procedure has been undertaken accurately too.HTO is the ` ultimate ' personal intervention: the amount of correction needed for optimal offloading is not yet completely understood.For the athletic person with early medial joint line overload who still runs and enjoys life , HTO using 3D printing is an attractive option. The clinical effectiveness remains unproven. Cite this article:
