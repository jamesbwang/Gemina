 To examine brain dopamine expression in chronic high-fat diet ( HFD)- induced obese mice. Ten male mice were fed by a high-fat diet ( HF: 45 % of calories from fat) for 12 weeks and then classified as HFD group. Ten male mice were fed a low-fat diet ( LF: 10 % of calories from fat) and used as control group ( NCD). In the 10 After 12 weeks of feeding , body<symptom> weight was significant higher in HFD mice than that in NCD ones. During GTT and ITT , HFD mice had significantly decreased glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance at 15 min and 30 min respectively than NCD ones ( The results showed that chronic consumption of high-fat food was associated with plasticity-related changes in reward circuitry in mice.
