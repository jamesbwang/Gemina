 Despite similar dispersal patterns , models of Pan sociality emphasize sex differences in social bonding between the two species. Such disparities are attributed to hypothesized differences in environmental selective pressures that structure association patterns. However , recent research documents greater within-species variation in social bonds in both species. Here , we examine grooming networks in captive chimpanzees at the North Carolina Zoo , and captive bonobos at the Columbus Zoo. We hypothesized that male-female grooming relationships would be the strongest in both species , but that males and females of both species would not significantly differ between centrality , strength , or clustering. Via Mantel tests , we found that neither bonobos ( t =- 0.070 , r =- 0.009 , two-tailed p = 0.942) nor chimpanzees ( t =- 0.495 , r =- 0.0939 , two-tailed p = 0.6205) had significant differences in grooming between or within sexes. Neither species had significant sex differences in centrality , strength , or clustering. To account for idiosyncratic factors affecting grooming distribution , we examined the effect of origin , kinship , and group tenure on social network position. We found that wild-born bonobos exhibited greater eigenvector centrality ( t =- 2.592 , df = 9 , p = 0.29) and strength ( t =- 2.401; df = 9 , p = 0.040) , and group tenure was significantly correlated with strength ( r = 0.608; N = 11 , p- 0 = 0.47). None of these factors varied with social network position in chimpanzees. Our findings suggest that in captive settings , idiosyncratic factors related to individual history play a greater role in structuring social networks. Such variation may point to the behavioral flexibility inherent in fission-fusion networks , and mirror between-site variation found in wild chimpanzees. However , some idiosyncratic factors shaping captive networks may be an artifact of captivity.
