 We studied how deficiency in lamins A/C and lamina-associated polypeptide 2α ( Lap2α) affects DNA repair after irradiation. A-type lamins and Lap2α were not recruited to local DNA lesions<symptom> and did not accumulate to γ-irradiation-induced foci ( IRIF) , as it is generally observed for well-known marker of DNA lesions<symptom> , 53BP1 protein. At micro-irradiated chromatin of lmna double knockout ( dn) and Lap2α dn cells , 53BP1 protein levels were reduced , compared to locally irradiated wild-type counterpart. Decreased levels of 53BP1 we also observed in whole populations of lmna dn and Lap2α dn cells , irradiated by UV light. We also studied distribution pattern of 53BP1 protein in a genome outside micro-irradiated region. In Lap2α deficient cells , identical fluorescence of mCherry-tagged 53BP1 protein was found at both microirradiated region and surrounding chromatin. However , a well-known marker of double strand breaks , γH2AX , was highly abundant in the lesion-surrounding genome of Lap2α deficient cells. Described changes , induced by irradiation in Lap2α dn cells , were not accompanied by cell cycle changes. In Lap2α dn cells , we additionally performed analysis by FLIM ( Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy) that showed different dynamic behavior of mCherry-tagged 53BP1 protein pools when it was compared with wild-type ( wt) fibroblasts. This analysis revealed three different fractions of mCherry-53BP1 protein. Two of them showed identical exponential decay times ( τ1 and τ3) , but the decay rate of τ2 and amplitudes of fluorescence decays ( A1-A3) were statistically different in wt and Lap2α dn fibroblasts. Moreover , γ-irradiation weakened an interaction between A-type lamins and Lap2α. Together , our results demonstrate how depletion of Lap2α affects DNA damage response ( DDR) and how chromatin compactness is changed in Lap2α deficient cells exposed to radiation.
