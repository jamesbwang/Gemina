 Active surveillance ( AS) represents a well-recognized management option for many patients with low- and very low-risk prostate cancer ( PCa). AS aims to reduce overtreatment whilst ensuring curative treatment for those in whom it is needed , without losing the window of curability. While long-term series have confirmed the safety of AS in carefully selected patients , this has resulted in new clinical questions. Can the inclusion criteria be expanded? Is there a role for biomarkers and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging at diagnosis or during AS? What is the optimal follow-up schedule as well as the most meaningful trigger for definitive treatment? These questions , together with increasingly adopted heterogeneous protocols in AS , have prompted the European Association of Urology to produce a position paper corroborated by a summary of the scientific background on AS. Active surveillance ( AS) is becoming a widely adopted strategy for patients affected by low-risk prostate cancer. While a formal systematic review on the topic will soon be available , the European Association of Urology has produced specific statements for different open questions on AS.
