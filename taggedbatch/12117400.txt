 Previous cross-sectional studies revealed a higher prevalence of depression<symptom> among glaucoma patients. However , cohort studies were in lack to build the risk of incident depression<symptom> after the diagnosis of glaucoma. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between glaucoma and the subsequent risk of developing depression<symptom> and to assess risk factors associated with depression<symptom> in glaucoma patients. A population-based retrospective cohort study using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database was conducted from January 1 , 2001 through December 31 , 2011. Glaucoma patients ( n = 8777) and age- and gender-matched control subjects without glaucoma ( n = 35,108) were enrolled in the study. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to compare the cumulative hazard of subsequent depression<symptom> between the glaucoma and control groups. A Cox regression analysis estimated the crude and adjusted hazard ratios ( HRs) for depression<symptom>. Risk factors leading to depression<symptom> were investigated among the glaucoma patients. Glaucoma patients had a significantly higher cumulative hazard of depression<symptom> compared to the control group ( p-value < 0.0001). The Cox regression model indicated that the glaucoma group had a significantly higher risk of depression<symptom> ( adjusted HR = 1.71). Within the glaucoma group , significant risk factors for depression<symptom> included age , female , low income , substance abuse , and living alone. However , the use of Î²-blocker eye drops and the number of glaucoma medications were not significant risk factors for depression<symptom>. Patients with glaucoma are at significantly greater risk of developing depression<symptom>. Among glaucoma patients , age , female , low income , substance abuse , and living alone were significant risk factors for depression<symptom>.
