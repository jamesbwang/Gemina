 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC) is expected to be the second leading cause of cancer mortality by 2030. PDAC remains resistant to the majority of systemic chemotherapies. In this paper , we explore if epigenetic sensitization can improve chemotherapy response in PDAC. Multiple PDAC cell lines were tested with serial concentrations of the epigenetic modulators 5-azacitidine ( Aza) and guadecitabine ( SGI-110). Guadecitabine was effective at inhibiting the expression of DNA Methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1) and in decreasing cell viability at nanomolar concentrations. We also report that guadecitabine has increased efficacy following a delay period or as we reference , a ` rest period '. Sensitization with guadecitabine improved response to the chemotherapeutic agent-Irinotecan- as measured by decreased cell viability and accompanied by an increase in caspase activity. Additional studies are needed to understand the mechanism of action.
