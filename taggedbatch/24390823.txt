 Feature-based attention has a spatially global effect , i.e. , responses to stimuli that share features with an attended stimulus are enhanced not only at the attended location but throughout the visual field. However , how feature-based attention modulates cortical neural responses at unattended locations remains unclear. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) to examine this issue as human participants performed motion- ( Experiment 1) and color- ( Experiment 2) based attention tasks. Results indicated that , in both experiments , the respective visual processing areas ( middle temporal area ( MT +) for motion and V4 for color) as well as early visual , parietal , and prefrontal areas all showed the classic feature-based attention effect , with neural responses to the unattended stimulus significantly elevated when it shared the same feature with the attended stimulus. Effective connectivity analysis using dynamic causal modeling ( DCM) showed that this spatially global effect in the respective visual processing areas ( MT + for motion and V4 for color) , intraparietal sulcus ( IPS) , frontal eye field ( FEF) , medial frontal gyrus ( mFG) , and primary visual cortex ( V1) was derived by feedback from the inferior frontal junction ( IFJ). Complementary effective connectivity analysis using Granger causality modeling ( GCM) confirmed that , in both experiments , the node with the highest outflow and netflow degree was IFJ , which was thus considered to be the source of the network. These results indicate a source for the spatially global effect of feature-based attention in the human prefrontal cortex.
