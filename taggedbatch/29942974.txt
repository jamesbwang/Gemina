 With a view to developing more efficient strategies to the functionalization of metallodrugs with carbohydrates , we here report on an innovative and efficient synthetic route to generate gold ( iii) glycoconjugates in high yields and purity. The method is based on the initial synthesis of the zinc ( ii)- dithiocarbamato intermediate ( ZnII ( SSC-Inp-GlcN) 2) ( Inp = isonipecotic moiety; GlcN = amino-glucose) followed by the transfer of the glucoseisonipecoticdithiocarbamato ligand to the gold ( iii) center via transmetallation reaction between the zinc ( ii) intermediate and K ( AuIIIBr4) in 1: 2 stoichiometric ratio , yielding the corresponding glucose-functionalized gold ( iii)- dithiocarbamato derivative ( AuIIIBr2 ( SSC-Inp-GlcN)). No protection/deprotection of the amino-glucose scaffold and no chromatographic purification were needed. The synthetic protocol was optimized for glucose precursors bearing the amino function at either the C2 or the C6 position , and works in the case of both α and β anomers. The application of the synthetic strategy was also successfully extended to other metal ions of biomedical interest , such as gold ( i) and platinum ( ii) , to obtain ( AuI ( SSC-Inp-GlcN) ( PPh3)) and ( PtII ( SSC-Inp-GlcN) 2) , respectively. All compounds were fully characterized by elemental analysis , mid- and far-IR , mono- and multidimensional NMR spectroscopy , and , where possible , X-ray crystallography. Results and potential applications are here discussed.
