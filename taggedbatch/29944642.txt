 Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP) greatly reduces the risk of HIV<pathogen> acquisition , but its optimal delivery strategy remains uncertain. Clinics for sexually transmitted infections ( STIs) can provide an efficient venue for PrEP delivery. To quantify the added value of STI clinic-based PrEP delivery , we used an agent-based simulation of HIV<pathogen> transmission among men who have sex with men ( MSM). We simulated the impact of PrEP delivery through STI clinics compared with PrEP delivery in other community-based settings. Our primary outcome was the projected twenty-year reduction in HIV<pathogen> incidence among MSM. Assuming PrEP uptake and adherence of 60 % each , evaluating STI clinic attendees and delivering PrEP to eligible MSM reduced HIV<pathogen> incidence by 16 % ( 95 % uncertainty range: 14 %- 18 %) over 20 years , an impact that was 1.8 ( 1.7-2.0) times as great as that achieved by evaluating an equal number of MSM recruited from the community. Comparing strategies where an equal number of MSM received PrEP in each strategy ( i.e. , evaluating more individuals for PrEP in the community-based strategy , since MSM attending STI clinics are more likely to be PrEP eligible) , the reduction in HIV<pathogen> incidence under the STI clinic-based strategy was 1.3 ( 1.3-1.4) times as great as that of community-based delivery. Delivering PrEP to MSM who attend STI clinics can improve efficiency and effectiveness. If high levels of adherence can be achieved in this population , STI clinics may be an important venue for PrEP implementation.
