 Chondrosarcoma ( CS) is the second most common primary bone sarcoma<disease> with no clear role for adjuvant therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate ( 1) the relationship between surgical excision margins and local recurrence free survival ( LRFS) , and ( 2) the role of local recurrence ( LR) in disease specific survival ( DSS) in CS of the extremity and pelvis. 341 pelvic and extremity CS diagnosed between 2003 and 2015 were studied retrospectively. LR developed in 23 % of cases. Pelvic location , pathologic fracture , margin and grade were significant factors for LR after univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed surgical margin and pelvic location as positive factors for LR , and grade-1 and 2 CS as negative factors for LR. Pathologic fracture , central versus peripheral , grade , and LR were significant factors with univariate analysis for DSS; and grade was significant after multivariate analysis for all patients for DSS. After competing risk analysis , LR was statistically significant for DSS in grade-2 and grade-3 tumors. Surgical margins determine LR in all CS grades , but LR affects DSS only in grade-2 and grade-3 tumors. Although narrow margins are acceptable in grade-1 tumors , since biopsy is unreliable in predicting final grade , a minimum 4-mm margin should be the aim in all cases.
