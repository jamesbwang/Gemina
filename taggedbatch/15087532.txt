 Climate and land use models predict that tropical deforestation and conversion to cropland will produce a large flux of soil carbon ( C) to the atmosphere from accelerated decomposition of soil organic matter ( SOM). However , the C flux from the deep tropical soils on which most intensive crop agriculture is now expanding remains poorly constrained. To quantify the effect of intensive agriculture on tropical soil C , we compared C stocks , radiocarbon , and stable C isotopes to 2 m depth from forests and soybean cropland created from former pasture in Mato Grosso , Brazil. We hypothesized that soil disturbance , higher soil temperatures ( +2 °C) , and lower OM inputs from soybeans would increase soil C turnover and deplete C stocks relative to nearby forest<disease> soils. However , we found reduced C concentrations and stocks only in surface soils ( 0-10 cm) of soybean cropland compared with forests , and these differences could be explained by soil mixing during plowing.
