 Lafoensia pacari A. St.-Hil. , belonging to the family Lythraceae and popularly known as ` dedaleira ' and ` mangava-brava , ' is a native tree of the Brazilian Cerrado , and its barks have been traditionally used as a tonic to treat inflammatory conditions , particularly related to gastric ulcers<disease><symptom> , wounds<disease><symptom> or fevers<symptom> and various types of cancer. We have previously demonstrated the apoptogenic effects of the methanolic extract of L. pacari using various cancer cell lines. In the present study , this extract has been partitioned into fractions to identify the components that might be responsible for the apoptogenic effects using HRT-18 cells , which have been previously demonstrated to be sensitive to this extract. A standard methanolic extract was prepared and fractionated by centrifugal partition chromatography. The fractions were submitted to cytotoxicity and clonogenic assays to monitor the effects in parallel with LC-DAD-MS and statistical analyses to suggest the potential bioactive compounds. Besides ellagic acid , the primary constituent of the plant and also the biomarker of the species , punicalin , pedunculagin and punicalagin isomers , catechin and ellagic acid derivatives were putatively identified. The barks of L. pacari are rich in ellagic acid and various hydrolysable tannins , some of which were reported for the first time in this species , such as punicalagin and ellagitannins. This mixture of substances had the ability to kill proliferating cells and abrogate the growth of clonogenic cells in a similar manner shown by the methanolic extract of our previous study. The collective data reported herein suggest that the biological activities of the L. pacari barks used by population to treat cancer conditions are due to the apoptogenic effects promoted by a mixed content of ellagitannins.
