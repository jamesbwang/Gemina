 We present an effective surface-enhancement Raman scattering ( SERS) substrate enabled by depositing metallic film on a liquid surface at room temperature. Thermal evaporation is used to deposit Au atoms on silicone oil surface and then form quasi-continuous films. Due to the isotropic characteristics of the liquid surface , this film consists of substantial nanoparticles with uniform diameter , which is different from films fabricated on solid substrates and can be served as an applicable substrate for SERS detection. With the assistance of this substrate , SERS signals of rhodamine 6G were significantly enhanced , the dependence between SERS spectra and film thickness was investigated. Analytical simulation results confirm the experimental observations and the superiorities of our proposed method for preparation of SERS substrate. This work provides a potential application of metallic film deposition on free-sustained surface and holds promise as an efficient sensor in rapid trace detection of small molecule analytes.
