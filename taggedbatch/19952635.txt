 Infection following augmentation and prosthetic-based breast reconstruction can cause significant physical and psychological distress for patients. It may delay adjuvant therapies and compromise aesthetic outcomes. The aim of this study is to identify modifiable risk factors for infection and identify common bacterial isolates to achieve optimal outcomes for patients. A retrospective cohort study was performed for patients undergoing implant-based breast reconstruction over a 2-year period. In each case , we documented demographics , co-morbidities , complications and antibiotic use. We reviewed treatments , infectious species cultured where applicable and all outcomes. A total of 292 patients met the inclusion criteria. Fifty-five patients ( 19 %) developed an infection. Univariate analysis showed a significantly increased infection rate with longer operative times ( This study identified judicious use of drains and efficiency in the operating room as modifiable risk factors for infections following implant-based breast reconstruction. Prospective trials to analyse techniques for infection prevention are warranted. Implant salvage following infection is a possible end-point in the appropriate patient.
