 Vismodegib is an oral and high selective hedgehog ( Hh) inhibitor used for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma ( BCC). In this work , analogs of Vismodegib with deuterium-for-hydrogen replacement at certain metabolically active sites were prepared and found to have a better pharmacokinetic properties in mice. In particular , deuterated compound SKLB-C2211 obviously altered the blood circulation behavior compared to its prototype , which was demonstrated by significantly prolonged blood circulation half-life time ( t
