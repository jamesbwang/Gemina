 Departing from past research on managers ' responses to employee voice , we propose and examine a nonlinear linkage between promotive/prohibitive voice and managers ' evaluations of voicers ( i.e. , manager-rated voicers ' promotability and overall performance). Drawing from social persuasion theory , we theorize that managers tend to give more positive evaluations to employees who engage in a moderate frequency of promotive/prohibitive voice than those who either rarely speak up or speak up very frequently. In Study 1 , based on a sample from a Chinese bank , we found that leader-member exchange quality ( LMX) moderated the inverted U-shaped linkage of prohibitive voice with manager-rated promotability of voicers , whereas the frequency of promotive voice was not related to promotability , irrespective of levels of LMX. In Study 2 , using employee-reported voice frequency , rather than the manager-rated measures adopted in Study 1 , we largely replicated the main findings of Study 1 based on a sample from an information technology firm in the United States. In Study 3 , using another U.S. sample , from a financial services firm , we found that manager-perceived voice constructiveness mediated the curvilinear interactive effect of prohibitive voice ( rather than promotive voice) and LMX on managers ' evaluations of employees ' overall performance.
