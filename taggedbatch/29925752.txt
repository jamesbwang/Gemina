 Assessment of left ventricular ( LV) diastolic function is important because it is possible to detect early sign of myocardial ischemia by this assessment. The purpose of this study was to compare between electrocardiogram ( ECG)- gated myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography ( G-SPECT) and ultrasound echocardiography in assessment of LV diastolic function in the small heart ( SH). The study population consisted of 144 patients who underwent both G-SPECT and ultrasound echocardiography. Peak filling rate ( PFR) , one-third mean filling rate ( 1/3 MFR) and the ratio of time to PFR to the RR interval ( TPFR/RR) were calculated by quantitative gated SPECT ( QGS) and heart risk view-F ( HRV-F). Peak early mitral annular velocity ( e ') was used as the reference standard of LV diastolic function. There were 33 patients with end-systolic volume ( ESV) of â‰¤ 10 ml ( SH10) , 51 patients with ESV of 11-20 ml ( SH 20) and 60 patients with ESV of > 20 ml ( normal-sized heart: NH). In SH10 , PFR calculated by QGS was not correlated with e '. However , that by HRV-F was significantly correlated with e ' ( r = 0.47 , p = 0.006). On the other hand , 1/3 MFR and TPFR/RR calculated by QGS and HRV-F were not correlated with e ' in SH10 and SH20. PFR , 1/3 MFR and TPFR/RR calculated by QGS and HRV-F were correlated with e ' in NH.
