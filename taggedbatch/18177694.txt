 Anaphylaxis is the most serious of all allergic reactions and can be fatal. The diagnosis is frequently delayed , and misdiagnosis often occurs with asthma or urticaria. Biomarkers such as tryptase are not routinely checked , and appropriate treatment with epinephrine is not administered in a majority of cases , increasing the risk of poor outcomes. The objective of this review is to provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of anaphylaxis with a description of phenotypes , endotypes , and biomarkers available in both the clinical and research settings. Expanding knowledge with regard to the presentation , causes , and triggers for anaphylaxis among health care providers will improve its diagnosis and management , increase patient safety , and decrease morbidity and mortality.
