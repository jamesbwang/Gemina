 Background Terminalia sericea ( T. sericea) is traditionally used to treat stomach ailments , infections , hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Previous in vitro studies have reported that T. sericea has lipolytic properties. This study interrogated the effects of T. sericea on linear growth , development of fatty liver disease , viscera morphometry and health of growing rats fed a 12 % fructose solution ( FS). Methods Thirty 21-day old male Wistar rat pups were randomly allocated to five treatments: group I- plain gelatine cubes ( PGC) + plain tap water ( PW) , group II- 12 % FS + PGC , group III- gelatine cubes containing fenofibrate ( Feno) at a dose of 100 mg/kg body + FS , group IV- gelatine cubes containing the low dose ( 100 mg/kg body mass per day) of the T. sericea extract ( TsL) + FS , group V- gelatine cubes containing the high dose ( 400 mg/kg body mass per day) of the T. sericea extract ( TsH) + FS. Following 12 weeks of feeding , the rats were fasted overnight , euthanized and plasma and viscera harvested for analysis. Results Consumption of fructose resulted in significantly increased ( p < 0.05) liver lipid content and caused macrovesicular steatosis. The T. sericea extracts at 400 mg/kg per day suppressed the fructose-induced liver lipid accumulation and macrovesicular steatosis similarly to 100 mg/kg per day of Feno. Conclusions These findings suggest that the aqueous T. sericea leaf extract at 400 mg/kg per day could potentially protect against fructose-induced lipid accumulation as well as macrovesicular steatosis.
