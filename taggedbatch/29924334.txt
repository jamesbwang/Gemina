 Mitochondria continuously undergo coordinated fusion and fission during vegetative growth to keep their homogeneity and to remove damaged components. A cytosolic AAA ATPase , Cdc48 , is implicated in the mitochondrial fusion event and turnover of a fusion-responsible GTPase in the mitochondrial outer membrane , Fzo1 , suggesting a possible linkage of mitochondrial fusion and Fzo1 turnover. Here , we identified two Cdc48 cofactor proteins , Ubp3 and Ubx2 , involving mitochondria regulation. In the absence of UBP3 , mitochondrial fragmentation and aggregation were observed. The turnover of Fzo1 was not affected in Î”ubp3 , but instead a deubiquitylase Ubp12 that removes fusion-required polyubiquitin chains from Fzo1 was stabilized. Thus , excess amount of Ubp12 may lead to mitochondrial fragmentation by removal of fusion-competent ubiquitylated Fzo1. In contrast , deletion of UBX2 perturbed disassembly of Fzo1 oligomers and their degradation without alteration of mitochondrial morphology. The UBX2 deletion led to destabilization of Ubp2 that negatively regulates Fzo1 turnover by removing degradation-signaling polyubiquitin chains , suggesting that Ubx2 would directly facilitate Fzo1 degradation. These results indicated that two different Cdc48-cofactor complexes independently regulate mitochondrial fusion and Fzo1 turnover.
