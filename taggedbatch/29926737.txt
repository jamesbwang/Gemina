 To describe the characteristics of psychiatrists working in the area of intellectual and developmental disability mental health ( IDDMH) across Australia and New Zealand. A secondary analysis of data collected by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2014 workforce survey. Characteristics of the IDDMH workforce ( n = 146 psychiatrists) were compared with those of the broader psychiatry workforce ( n = 1050 psychiatrists). The IDDMH workforce were more likely than the broader psychiatry workforce to be working across both the public and private health sectors , be engaged in outreach work , endorse specialty practice areas pertinent to IDDMH , treat younger patients and work more clinical hours per week. Part-time status and retirement plans of the IDDMH workforce matched those of the broader psychiatry workforce. While some elements of the IDDMH workforce profile suggest this workforce is tailored to the needs of the population , the potential shortage of IDDMH psychiatrists highlights the need for the development of a specific training programme and pathway in this area.
