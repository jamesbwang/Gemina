 A newly designed thiazoline iminopyridine ligand for enantioselective cobalt-catalyzed sequential Nazarov cyclization/electrophilic fluorination was developed. Various chiral α-fluorocyclopentenones were prepared with good yields and diastereo- and enantioselectivities. Further derivatizations could be easily carried out to provide chiral cyclopentenols with three contiguous stereocenters. Furthermore , a direct deesterification of fluorinated products could afford chiral α-single fluorine-substituted cyclopentenones.
