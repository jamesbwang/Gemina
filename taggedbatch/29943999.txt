 Numerous emotion-based constructs seem related to pain and pain-related disability. These include general affect constructs such as anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> , as well as specific anxiety-related constructs such as anxiety<symptom> sensitivity and fear of pain. Few studies examine the relationships between these constructs. Those that have suggest they can be reduced to three or four underlying components. We used a confirmatory approach to test the models of pain-related anxiety<symptom> found in previous exploratory studies. Adult<disease> participants ( N = 294) completed commonly used measures of affect-related constructs relevant to pain. Confirmatory Factor Analyses tested three models to determine the best fit. The tripartite model , with small modifications , was found to provide the best fit. The model consisted of: 1) General distress , 2) Fear of pain from injury/insult , and 3) Cognitive intrusion of pain.
