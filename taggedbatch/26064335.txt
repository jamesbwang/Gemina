 BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to investigate splanchnic hemodynamic changes and determine an optimal cutoff value for risk factors of portal venous system thrombosis ( PVST) after splenectomy with periesophagogastric devascularization ( SPD) in cirrhotic patients with esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding ( EGVB) and portal hypertension ( PH). MATERIAL AND METHODS Data on patients who underwent SPD were collected retrospectively from January 2013 to December 2017. Color Doppler ultrasound was performed to detect hemodynamic changes of the hepatic artery , splenic artery , splenic vein , and portal vein in included patients ( n = 60) and healthy volunteers ( n = 30). Outcomes were compared between preoperative and postoperative biochemical indicators. The cutoff values for hemodynamics were identified using receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis , and univariate and multivariate analyses of risk factors of PVST were performed. RESULTS In our series , hemodynamic indexes of splenic artery , spleen vein , and portal vein in the study group were significantly higher than that of the control group ( P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that the portal vein flow and the internal diameter of the portal vein were significantly correlated with PVST. The ROC analysis revealed that the cutoff points for portal vein flow and internal diameter of the splenic vein and portal vein were ≥ 1822.32 ml/min , ≥ 1.37 cm , and ≥ 1.56 cm , respectively. CONCLUSIONS SPD is an effective treatment in cirrhotic patients with concomitant EGVB and PH by increasing hepatic artery flow and decreasing portal vein flow. High portal vein flow and wider diameters of the portal vein and splenic vein are important markers of PVST.
