 5-aminosalicylic acid has been reported to be able of inducing acute pancreatitis<disease> as an adverse reaction.

A systematic search of the literature was performed and 42 cases from 35 articles were summarized concerning the clinical course of 5-aminosalicylic acid induced acute pancreatitis<disease>.
