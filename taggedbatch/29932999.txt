 Chalcidoidea is one of the most diverse group in Hymenoptera by possessing striking mitochondrial gene arrangement. By using next generation sequencing method , the first two nearly complete mitochondrial genomes in the family Aphelinidae ( Insecta , Hymenopetra , Chalcidoidea) were obtained in this study. Almost all previously sequenced mitochondrial genome of Chalcidoidea species have a large inversion including six genes ( atp6-atp8-trnD-trnK-cox2-trnL2-cox1) as compared with ancestral mitochondrial genome , but these two Encarsia mitochondrial genomes had a large inversion including nine genes ( nad3-trnG-atp6-atp8-trnD-trnK-cox2-trnL2-cox1) , which was only congruent with the species in the genus Nasonia. Moreover , we found that one shuffling changes ( trnD and trnK) happened in the species E. obtusiclava but not in another species E. formosa within the same genus , of which such shuffling within the same genus at this region was only detected in Polisters within Insecta. Phylogenetic analysis displayed that different data matrix ( 13PCG + 2 rRNA or 13 PCG) and inference methods ( BI or ML) indicate the identical topology with high nodal supports that Aphelinidae formed a sister group with ( Trichogrammatidae + Aganoidae) and the monophyly of Pteramalidae. Our results also indicated the validity of assembling and feasibility of next-generation technology to obtain the mitochondrial genomes of parasitic Hymenoptera.
