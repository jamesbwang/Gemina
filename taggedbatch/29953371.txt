 The use of radiation is an essential part of both modern cancer diagnostic assessment and treatment. Next-generation imaging devices create 3D visualizations , allowing for better diagnoses and improved planning of precision treatment. This is particularly important for primary brain cancers such as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma or the most common primary brain tumor , glioblastoma , because radiotherapy is often the only treatment modality that offers a significant improvement in survival and quality of life. In this review , we give an overview of the different imaging techniques and the historic role of radiotherapy and its place in modern cancer therapy. Finally , we discuss three key areas of risks associated with the use of ionizing radiation: ( 1) brain tumor induction mainly as a consequence of the diagnostic use of radiation; ( 2) cognitive decline as a consequence of treating childhood brain tumors as an example of long term consequences often neglected in favor of highlighting secondary primary cancers; and ( 3) pro-proliferative and pro-invasive alterations that occur in tumor cells that survive radiotherapy. Throughout the discussion , we highlight areas of potential future research.
