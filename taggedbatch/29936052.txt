 The aim of this clinical study was to compare the survival , modified California Dental Association ( CDA) criteria , and periodontal parameters of laminate veneers made with Empress CAD and emax CAD over 60 months. One hundred and ninety seven ceramic laminate veneers were placed in 71 patients in a private practice. The restorations were made using CEREC AC Bluecam with Empress CAD and emax CAD blocks. Modified CDA guidelines were used to evaluate clinical performance of the restorations. Gingival and plaque indices , probing pocket depth , and bleeding on probing were also recorded. Patient 's satisfaction was assessed using visual analogue scale. Kaplan-Meier and Log rank test were used to analyze survival probability and success rate of the restorations. CDA rating of Empress CAD and emax CAD was compared with Log rank test ( α = 0.05). The survival rates of ceramic Empress CAD and emax CAD laminate veneers were 97.8 % and 100 % respectively ( p = 0.13). The success rate of these veneers was 92.4 % for Empress CAD and 100 % for emax CAD ( p < 0.05). Two Empress CAD laminate veneer failed because of fracture. Other restorations had very good or good CDA scores after 5 years. The periodontal parameters were not significantly different between first and fifth years except plaque index. The mean score of patients ' satisfaction was 95.5 ± 8.4. Chair-side computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing ceramic laminate veneers were clinically successful restorations with mean survival rate of 99.0 % and success rate of 96.4 % after 5 years.
