 Lung cancer is a common cancer in human and has presented significant genetic predisposition. Previous genome-wide association study observed that rs401681 within CLPTM1L ( CLPTM1 like) was significantly associated with lung cancer. By analyzing 1000 genomes data for East Asian , we identified only one SNP in nearby region , rs402710 , in high linkage disequilibrium with rs401681 , which was also associated with lung cancer. However , the real causal SNP and mechanism for the association was still not clear. The following plasmid construction , mutagenesis , transient transfection and luciferase reading indicated that both SNPs could regulate gene expression in lung/bronchial epithelium Beas-2B cell line. By chromosome conformation capture , it was identified that the segment containing these two SNPs could interact with TERT ( telomerase reverse transcriptase) promoter , thus indicating that these SNPs confer lung cancer risk by regulating TERT expression instead of CLPTM1L. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation , the transcript factors HNF4A ( hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha) and MAF1 ( MAF1 homolog , negative regulator of RNA polymerase III) were recognized for the regions spanning rs401681 and rs402710 , respectively. Our results uncovered a complete link between these two SNPs and lung cancer.
