 Popular methods for exploring the space of rooted phylogenetic trees use rearrangement moves such as rooted Nearest Neighbour Interchange ( rNNI) and rooted Subtree Prune and Regraft ( rSPR). Recently , these moves were generalized to rooted phylogenetic networks , which are a more suitable representation of reticulate evolutionary histories , and it was shown that any two rooted phylogenetic networks of the same complexity are connected by a sequence of either rSPR or rNNI moves. Here , we show that this is possible using only tail moves , which are a restricted version of rSPR moves on networks that are more closely related to rSPR moves on trees. The connectedness still holds even when we restrict to distance-1 tail moves ( a localized version of tail moves). Moreover , we give bounds on the number of ( distance-1) tail moves necessary to turn one network into another , which in turn yield new bounds for rSPR , rNNI and SPR ( i.e. the equivalent of rSPR on unrooted networks). The upper bounds are constructive , meaning that we can actually find a sequence with at most this length for any pair of networks. Finally , we show that finding a shortest sequence of tail or rSPR moves is NP-hard.
