 The dysregulation of miRNAs has been increasingly recognized as a critical mediator of cancer development and progression. Here we show that frequent deletion of the MIR135A1 locus is associated with poor prognosis in primary breast cancer. Forced expression of miR-135a decreased breast cancer progression , whilst inhibition of miR-135a with a specific miRNA sponge elicited opposing effects , suggestive of a tumor suppressive role of miR-135a in breast cancer. Estrogen receptor alpha ( ERα) bound the promoter of MIR135A1 for its transcriptional activation , whereas tamoxifen treatment inhibited expression of miR-135a in ERα + breast cancer cells. miR-135a directly targeted ESR1 , ESRRA , and NCOA1 , forming a negative feedback loop to inhibit ERα signaling. This regulatory feedback between miR-135a and ERα demonstrated that miR-135a regulated the response to tamoxifen. The tamoxifen-mediated decrease in miR-135a expression increased the expression of miR-135a targets to reduce tamoxifen sensitivity. Consistently , miR-135a expression was downregulated in ERα + breast cancer cells with acquired tamoxifen resistance , while forced expression of miR-135a partially re-sensitized these cells to tamoxifen. Tamoxifen resistance mediated by the loss of miR-135a was shown to be partially dependent on the activation of ERK1/2 and AKT pathways by miR-135a-targeted genes. Taken together , these results indicate that deletion of the MIR135A1 locus and decreased miR-135a expression promotes ERα + breast cancer progression and tamoxifen resistance.
