 Penetrating electronics have been used for treating epilepsy , yet their therapeutic effects are debated largely due to the lack of a large-scale , real-time , and safe recording/stimulation. Here , the proposed technology integrates ultrathin epidural electronics into an electrocorticography array , therein simultaneously sampling brain signals in a large area for diagnostic purposes and delivering electrical pulses for treatment. The system is empirically tested to record the ictal-like activities of the thalamocortical network in vitro and in vivo using the epidural electronics. Also , it is newly demonstrated that the electronics selectively diminish epileptiform activities , but not normal signal transduction , in live animals. It is proposed that this technology heralds a new generation of diagnostic and therapeutic brain-machine interfaces. Such an electronic system can be applicable for several brain diseases such as tinnitus<symptom> , Parkinson 's disease , Huntington 's disease , depression<symptom> , and schizophrenia.
