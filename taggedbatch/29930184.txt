 A 32-year-old man was referred to our surgical unit with a left adrenal lesion<symptom>. He was previously diagnosed with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome<disease><symptom> after presenting with a left pneumothorax and an incidental finding of a right apical lung mass. This syndrome<disease><symptom> is characterised commonly by benign skin hamartomas , recurrent pneumothoraces and an increased risk of renal tumours. He was unable to tolerate a biopsy of his lung lesion<symptom> , however , this lung lesion<symptom> was thought to be benign. Given the size of his adrenal lesion<symptom> and radiological appearances , we performed a laparoscopic left adrenalectomy. Pathology confirmed that based on morphological appearances and immunohistochemical staining , this may represent an oncocytic tumour of the adrenal gland. This is only the third published case of an oncocytic tumour of the adrenal gland in a patient with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome<disease><symptom>.
