 The aging of America will include a significant increase in the number of older patients with cancer , many of whom will experience significant depressive symptoms. Although geriatric depression<symptom> is a well-studied construct , its symptom presentation in the context of cancer is less clear. Latent profile analysis was conducted on depressive symptoms in younger ( 40-64 years) and older ( â‰¥ 65 years) patients with cancer ( N = 636). The sample was clinically heterogeneous ( i.e. , included all stages , dominated by advanced stage disease). Participants completed questionnaires including the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale , which was used for the latent profile analysis. A four-class pattern was supported for each age group. However , the four-class pattern was significantly different between the younger and older groups in terms of the item means within each corresponding latent class; differences were primarily driven by severity such that across classes , older adults endorsed milder symptoms. An unexpected measurement issue was uncovered regarding reverse-coded items , suggesting that they may generate unreliable scores on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for a significant subset of patients. The results indicate that cancer clinicians can expect to see depressive symptoms along a continuum of severity for patients of any age , with less severe<symptom> symptoms<symptom> among older patients.
