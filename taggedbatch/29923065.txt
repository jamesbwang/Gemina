 The primary degradation of benzene derivatives in aquatic environments occurs via microbial and chemical processes. This study investigated the kinetic degradation of o-ethyltoluene and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene in the wetland of Lake Naivasha. Sediment samples were collected from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM at intervals of 3 h during the dry season of December 2017. The sediment samples were air dried , ground into powder , followed by soxhlet extraction in a binary mixture of methanol and hexane in the ratio of 1:1. The extract was analyzed using gas chromatograph with mass selective detector. Variation in the concentrations of o-ethyltoluene and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene with time was monitored kinetically. Accordingly , the half-lives for the degradation of o-ethyltoluene and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene were 4.9 and 5.4 h , respectively , and their corresponding decay rate constants were 3.93 Ã— 10
