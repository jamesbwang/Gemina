 The aim was to develop and psychometrically test the self-care of chronic illness Inventory , a generic measure of self-care. Existing measures of self-care are disease-specific or behaviour-specific; no generic measure of self-care exists. Cross-sectional survey. We developed a 20-item self-report instrument based on the Middle Range Theory of Self-Care of Chronic Illness , with three separate scales measuring Self-Care Maintenance , Self-Care Monitoring , and Self-Care Management. Each of the three scales is scored separately and standardized 0-100 with higher scores indicating better self-care. After demonstrating content validity , psychometric testing was conducted in a convenience sample of 407 adults ( enrolled from inpatient and outpatient settings at five sites in the United States and ResearchMatch.org). Dimensionality testing with confirmatory factor analysis preceded reliability testing. The Self-Care Maintenance scale ( eight items , two dimensions: illness-related and health-promoting behaviour) fit well when tested with a two-factor confirmatory model. The Self-Care Monitoring scale ( five items , single factor) fitted well. The Self-Care Management scale ( seven items , two factors: autonomous and consulting behaviour) , when tested with a two-factor confirmatory model , fitted adequately. A simultaneous confirmatory factor analysis on the combined set of items supported the more general model. The self-care of chronic illness inventory is adequate in reliability and validity. We suggest further testing in diverse populations of patients with chronic illnesses.
