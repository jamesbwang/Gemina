 Over the last few decades , Drosophila cancer models have made great contributions to our understanding toward fundamental cancer processes. Particularly , the development of genetic mosaic technique in Drosophila has enabled us to recapitulate basic aspects of human cancers , including clonal evolution , tumor microenvironment , cancer cachexia , and anticancer drug resistance. The mosaic technique has also led to the discovery of important tumor-suppressor pathways such as the Hippo pathway and the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying tumor growth and metastasis via regulation of cell polarity , cell-cell cooperation , and cell competition. Recent approaches toward identification of novel therapeutics using fly cancer models have further proved Drosophila as a robust system with great potentials for cancer research as well as anti-cancer therapy.
