 Tubular injury is considered as a crucial pathological feature of diabetic nephropathy. LncRNA MALAT1 is involved in diabetic complications. Hence the role of MALAT1 in high glucose-induced renal tubular epithelial cells ( HK-2) injury deserves investigation. The diabetic mice model was established with streptozotocin ( STZ) injection. The expression of NEAT1 , SIRT1 , and Foxo1 mRNA and protein was determined with qRT-PCR and western blot , respectively. The serum creatinine and urinary albumin were examined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). Interaction between MALAT1 and Foxo1 was detected with RIP and RNA pull-down assay , respectively. Dual luciferase reporter assay was used to evaluate the binding between Foxo1 and SIRT1. LncRNA MALAT1 was up-regulated in kidney tissues of diabetic mice and in HK-2 cells treated with high glucose , while the expression of SIRT1 was decreased. Interaction between MALAT1 and Foxo1 was observed in HK-2 cells and the interaction was promoted by high glucose treatment. Foxo1 activated SIRT1 transcription by binding to its promoter , and MALAT1 repressed SIRT1 expression through targeting Foxo1. LncRNA MALAT1 interacts with transcription factor Foxo1 to represses SIRT1 transcription in high glucose incubated HK-2 cells , which promotes high glucose-induced HK-2 cells injury.
