 Proteins deacetylation by Histone deacetylase 6 ( HDAC6) has been shown in various<disease> human chronic<disease> diseases<disease> like neurodegenerative diseases and cancer , and hence is an important therapeutic target. Since , the existing inhibitors have hydroxamate group , and are not HDAC6-selective , therefore , this study has designed to investigate non-hydroxamate HDAC6 inhibitors. Ligand-based pharmacophore was generated from 26 training set compounds of HDAC6 inhibitors. The statistical parameters of pharmacophore ( Hypo1) included lowest total cost of 115.63 , highest cost difference of 135.00 , lowest RMSD of 0.70 and the highest correlation of 0.98. The pharmacophore was validated by Fischer 's Randomization and Test Set validation , and used as screening tool for chemical databases. The screened compounds were filtered by fit value ( ( Formula: see text)) , estimated Inhibitory Concentration ( IC ( Formula: see text)) ( ( Formula: see text)) , Lipinski 's Rule of Five and Absorption , Distribution , Metabolism , Excretion , and Toxicity ( ADMET) Descriptors to identify drug-like compounds. Furthermore , the drug-like compounds were docked into the active site of HDAC6. The best docked compounds were selected having goldfitness score ( Formula: see text) and ( Formula: see text) , and hydrogen bond interaction with catalytic active residues. Finally , three inhibitors having sulfamoyl group were selected by Molecular Dynamic ( MD) simulation , which showed stable root mean square deviation ( RMSD) ( 1.6-1.9 ( Formula: see text) Ã…) , lowest potential energy ( ( Formula: see text) ( Formula: see text) kJ/mol) , and hydrogen bonding with catalytic active residues of HDAC6.
