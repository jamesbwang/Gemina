 The rare morphological variant of anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL) may pose a challenge in diagnosis , especially when presentation primarily involves skin<symptom> lesions<symptom>. Here we describe a rare case of small cell variant of ALCL in an 11-year-old girl. We performed clinical , morphological , and immunohistochemical analyses of developed cutaneous nodules<symptom>. Pathologists should consider this small cell variant in ALCL differential diagnosis , as early and correct diagnosis has important clinical implications. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation appears to be a promising treatment option for small cell variant of ALCL. Histological diagnosis of small cell variant of ALCL is challenging among pediatricians because of its low incidence and atypical presentation. We provide a short review of the small cell variant of ALCL to facilitate the diagnosis of this difficult-to-recognize entity.
