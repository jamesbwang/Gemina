 Although effective follow-up of sexual assault survivors is linked to optimal recovery , attendance at follow-up consultations is poor. It is therefore essential that health care providers maximise the benefit of follow-up care for every sexual assault survivor. This study explored the personal experiences of sexual assault survivors to better understand the enablers of , and barriers to , attendance at follow-up consultations. This phenomenological qualitative study was conducted at the three hospitals which manage most sexual assault survivors within the Eden District. Using purposive sampling , 10 participants were selected. Consenting participants shared their experiencesduring semi-structured interviews with the researcher. Authoritative , client-held documentation was a powerful enabler to accessing follow-up care. Individualised , patient-centred care further enhanced participants ' access to , and utilisation of , health care services. The failure of health care providers to integrate follow-up care for sexual assault survivors into established chronic care services was a missedopportunity in the continuum of care. Negative perceptions , based on others ' or personal prior experience of police , judicial and health care systems , were further barriers to follow-up care. This study highlights the need of survivors of sexual assault for integrated,patient-centred care , encompassing principles of good communication. Committed actions of all stakeholders are necessary to tackle negative perceptions that create barriers to follow-upcare. A simple practical strategy , the provision of a scheduled appointment on official stationery , is easy to effect at facility level. As a powerful enabler to follow-up care , this should be implemented as a priority intervention.
