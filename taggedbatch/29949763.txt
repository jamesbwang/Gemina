 To discover microRNAs that regulate sleep , we performed a genetic screen using a library of miRNA sponge-expressing flies. We identified 25 miRNAs that regulate baseline sleep; 17 were sleep-promoting and 8 promoted wake. We identified one miRNA that is required for recovery sleep after deprivation and 8 miRNAs that limit the extent of recovery sleep. 65 % of the hits belong to human-conserved families. Interestingly , the majority ( 75 %) , but not all , of the baseline sleep-regulating miRNAs are required in neurons. Sponges that target miRNAs in the same family , including the miR-92a/ 92b/310 family and the miR-263a/ 263b family , have similar effects. Finally , mutation of one of the screen 's strongest hits , let-7 , using CRISPR/Cas -9 , phenocopies sponge-mediated let-7 inhibition. Cell-type-specific and temporally restricted let-7 sponge expression experiments suggest that let-7 is required in the mushroom body both during development and in adulthood. This screen sets the stage for understanding the role of miRNAs in sleep.
