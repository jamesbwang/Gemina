 We present efficient and reproducible parallel strategies for preparing large quantities of pure heteroduplex plasmids containing defined mismatches. The strategies described involve the use of synthetic oligonucleotides , the commercially available pGEM-T plasmid , and nicking enzymes to prepare prerequisite ssDNA<pathogen>. Alternatively , bacterial packaging cell lines containing an engineered phagemid construct to produce ssDNA<pathogen> without the need of a helper phage were utilized , hence providing added flexibility and choice. These integrated approaches help to construct different mismatch substrates of choice in large quantities , thus enhancing the usability of mismatch repair assays and extending their range and accessibility to wider research groups.
