 HIV-associated lymphomas ( HAL) remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV<pathogen> patients , especially in the setting of treatment-refractory disease. Hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT) is considered a curative option for patients with refractory HAL. We report the efficacy of autologous HCT in 20 patients with HAL ( non-Hodgkin lymphoma = 14 ( 70 %) , Hodgkin lymphoma = 6 ( 30 %)). At the time of transplantation , the median peripheral blood CD4 The median follow-up of surviving patients was 47 months ( range , 20-119 months). The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 11 days. The median progression-free survival and median overall survival have not been reached. At 4 years after transplantation , progression-free survival and overall survival were 65 % and 70 % , respectively. Six patients died from disease relapse or progression ( n = 5) and infection ( n = 1). Nonrelapse mortality was 0 and 5 % at 100 days and 4 years after transplantation , respectively. Autologous HCT is an effective therapy for refractory/relapsed HAL with manageable toxicity , similar to non-HIV patients.
