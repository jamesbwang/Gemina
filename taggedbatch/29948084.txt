 To prospectively investigate concordance between whole-body MRI ( WB-MRI) and a composite reference standard for initial staging and interim response evaluation in paediatric and adolescent Hodgkin 's lymphoma. Fifty patients ( 32 male , age range 6-19 years) underwent WB-MRI and standard investigations , including There was discordance for full stage in 74 % ( 95 % CI 61.9-83.9 %) and 44 % ( 32.0-56.6 %) of patients against the primary and enhanced reference standards , respectively. Against the enhanced reference standard , the WB-MRI TPR , FPR and kappa were 91 % , 1 % and 0.93 ( 0.90-0.96) for nodal disease and 79 % , < 1 % and 0.86 ( 0.77-0.95) for extra-nodal disease. WB-MRI response classification was correct in 25/38 evaluable patients ( 66 %) , underestimating response in 26 % ( kappa 0.30 , 95 % CI 0.04-0.57). There was a good agreement for nodal ( kappa 0.78 , 95 % CI 0.73-0.84) and extra-nodal staging ( kappa 0.60 , 95 % CI 0.41-0.78) between WB-MRI reads CONCLUSIONS: WB-MRI has reasonable accuracy for nodal and extra-nodal staging but is discordant with standard imaging in a substantial minority of patients , and tends to underestimate disease response. • This prospective single-centre study showed discordance for full patient staging of 44 % between WB-MRI and a multi-modality reference standard in paediatric and adolescent Hodgkin 's lymphoma. • WB-MRI underestimates interim disease response in paediatric and adolescent Hodgkin 's lymphoma. • WB-MRI shows promise in paediatric and adolescent Hodgkin 's lymphoma but currently can not replace conventional staging pathways including
