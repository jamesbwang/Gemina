 To conduct a dose-response assessment of the efficacy and safety of the glucagon receptor antagonist PF-06291874 in adults with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM) using stable doses of metformin. This randomized , double-blind , statin-stratified , placebo-controlled , 4-arm , parallel-group study was conducted in patients with T2DM who were receiving background metformin. After an 8-week , non-metformin oral antidiabetic agent washout period , 206 patients were randomized to placebo or PF-06291874 ( 30 , 60 or 100 mg once daily) for 12 weeks. Glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c) , fasting plasma glucose ( FPG) and safety endpoints were assessed at baseline and post baseline. Dose-dependent mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c for PF-06291874 ranged from -0.67 % ( -7.29 mmol/mol) to -0.93 % ( -10.13 mmol/mol) , and for FPG from -16.6 to -33.3 mg/dL after 12 weeks of dosing. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was low and was similar between groups receiving PF-06291874 and placebo. Small , non-dose-dependent increases in LDL cholesterol ( < 10 %) and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) ( systolic BP > 2 mm Hg; diastolic BP > 1 mm Hg) were observed with PF-06291874. Modest non-dose-dependent median increases were observed across PF-06291874 groups at 12 weeks for alanine aminotransferase ( range , 37.6-48.7 U/L vs placebo) and aspartate aminotransferase ( range , 33.3-36.6 U/L vs placebo); these were not associated with bilirubin changes. Small increases were observed in body<symptom> weight ( < 0.5 kg) in each PF-06291874 group vs placebo. In patients with T2DM , PF-06291874 significantly lowered HbA1c and glucose , was well tolerated and carried a low risk of hypoglycaemia. Small , non-dose-related increases in BP , lipids and hepatic transaminases were observed.
