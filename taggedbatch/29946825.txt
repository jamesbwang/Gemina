 None PET/CT data were reviewed retrospectively for 105 patients referred for evaluation of CAD , who also underwent angiography. % arterial stenosis was determined quantitatively at a core laboratory. Severe stenosis was defined as ≥ 70 % , and MVD as 2 or more stenosed arteries. Segmental MBF was calculated from first-pass data for arterial territories. Regional rest and stress systolic and diastolic asynchrony ( Asynch) scores were determined from visual examination of phase polar maps. 65 vessels had stenoses ≥ 70 %. 15 patients had MVD. ROC area under curve ( ROC AUC) for identifying patients with MVD was 83 % for Asynch and 73 % for MFR. ROC AUC for identifying individual arterial territories with stenoses ≥ 70 % was 81 % and 72 % for Asynch and MFR. None
