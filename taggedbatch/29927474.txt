 To report the case of a ruptured eyeball caused by high-pressure water jets. In this study , the right eye of a 49-year-old male was injured by high-pressure water jets while he was engaged in demolition work. Upon examination , remarkable hyphema and vitreous hemorrhage<symptom> were observed in the injured eye. After treating the patient 's right eye with vitrectomy , in addition to lens subluxation and iridodialysis , retinal detachment was observed at the nasal inferior. The edge of the retinal break was found to be incarcerated into the nasal sclera<symptom> rupture wounds<disease><symptom>. The findings of this study indicate that direct exposure to high-pressure water jets can cause a rupture of the eyeball. ( Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2018; 49:451-455.).
