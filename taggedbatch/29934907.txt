 Over the recent years development toward assessing skin sensitization hazard has moved toward non-animal testing methods. These methods are based on the key events as described in the OECD Adverse Outcome Pathway ( AOP) for skin sensitization initiated by covalent binding to proteins. As these individual methods address mainly one mechanistic event ( key event) in the initiation of skin sensitization , combination of different methods are needed to conclude on the skin sensitization hazard. Validated and regulatory adopted ( EU and OECD) in chemico/in vitro methods are available for KEs 1-3 and are presented here. This chapter also illustrates how individual test methods can be combined by providing two examples of defined approaches to testing and assessment for skin sensitization hazard identification and assessment.
