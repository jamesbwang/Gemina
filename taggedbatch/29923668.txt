 Our objective was to present recent trends in the UK HIV<pathogen> epidemic ( 2007-2016) and the public health response. HIV<pathogen> diagnoses and clinical markers were extracted from the HIV<pathogen> and AIDS Reporting System; HIV<pathogen> testing data in sexual health services ( SHS) were taken from GUMCAD STI Surveillance System. HIV<pathogen> data were modelled to estimate the incidence in men who have sex with men ( MSM) and post-migration HIV<pathogen> acquisition in heterosexuals. Office for National Statistics ( ONS) data enabled mortality rates to be calculated. New HIV<pathogen> diagnoses have declined in heterosexuals as a result of decreasing numbers of migrants from high HIV<pathogen> prevalence countries entering the UK. Among MSM , the number of HIV<pathogen> diagnoses fell from 3570 in 2015 to 2810 in 2016 ( and from 1554 to 1096 in London). Preceding the decline in HIV<pathogen> diagnoses , modelled estimates indicate that transmission began to fall in 2012 , from 2800 ( credible interval ( CrI) 2300-3200) to 1700 ( CrI 900-2700) in 2016. The crude mortality rate among people promptly diagnosed with HIV<pathogen> infection was comparable to that in the general population ( 1.22 vs. 1.39 per 1000 aged 15-59 years , respectively). The number of MSM tested for HIV<pathogen> at SHS increased annually; 28 % of MSM who were tested in 2016 had been tested in the preceding year. In 2016 , 76 % of people started antiretroviral therapy within 90 days of diagnosis ( 33 % in 2007). The dual successes of the HIV<pathogen> transmission decline in MSM and reduced mortality are attributable to frequent HIV<pathogen> testing and prompt treatment ( combination prevention). Progress towards the elimination of HIV<pathogen> transmission , AIDS and HIV-related deaths could be achieved if combination prevention , including pre-exposure prophylaxis , is replicated for all populations.
