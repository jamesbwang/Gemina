 One mechanism by which cartilage responds to mechanical load is by releasing heparin-bound growth factors from the pericellular matrix ( PCM). By proteomic analysis of the PCM , we identified connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF) and here investigate its function and mechanism of action. Recombinant CTGF ( rCTGF) was used to stimulate human chondrocytes for microarray analysis. Endogenous CTGF was investigated by in vitro binding assays and confocal microscopy. Its release from cut cartilage ( injury CM) was analysed by Western blot under reducing and non-reducing conditions. A postnatal , conditional Ctgf The biological responses of rCTGF were TGFβ dependent. CTGF displaced latent TGFβ from cartilage and both were released on cartilage injury. CTGF and latent TGFβ migrated as a single high molecular weight band under non-reducing conditions , suggesting that they were in a covalent ( disulfide) complex<pathogen>. This was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. Using Ctgf CTGF is a latent TGFβ binding protein that controls the matrix sequestration and activation of TGFβ in cartilage. Deletion of CTGF in vivo caused a paradoxical increase in Smad2 phosphorylation resulting in thicker cartilage that was protected from OA.
