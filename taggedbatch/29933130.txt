 As a novel neonicotinoids insecticide , acetamiprid has been widely used worldwide. In this study , a laboratory test was conducted to expose earthworms ( Eisenia fetida) to artificial soil spiked with various concentrations of acetamiprid ( 0 , 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg of soil) respectively after 7 , 14 , 21 and 28 d. Reactive oxygen species ( ROS) generation , antioxidant enzymes activity including superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , catalase ( CAT) and glutathione S-transferases ( GST) , malondialdehyde ( MDA) content , and DNA damage were determined in earthworms. The ROS level increased in varying degrees at most exposure concentrations. The SOD activity was not significantly affected. The CAT activity was increased in the beginning , then gradually suppressed and resumed to the control level at the end , with the maximum change ( 171 %) occurred at 14 d for 0.05 mg/kg. The GST activity was induced at 7 d , and then inhibited , with the maximum change ( 67.6 %) occurred at 14 d for 0.50 mg/kg. The MDA content had a tendency that increasing at the first and decreasing at the end. The olive tail moment ( OTM) in comet assay reflected a dose-dependent relationship , and DNA damage initially increased and then decreased over time. The results suggest that the sub-chronic exposure of acetamiprid can cause oxidative stress and DNA damage of earthworm and change the activity of the anti-oxidant enzyme. In addition , ROS content and DNA damage can be good indicators for assessing environmental risks of acetamiprid in earthworms.
