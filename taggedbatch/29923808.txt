 It is a fundamental element in both research and clinical applications of electroencephalography to know the frequency composition of brain electrical activity. The quantitative analysis of brain electrical activity uses computer resources to evaluate the electroencephalography and allows quantification of the data. The contribution of the quantitative perspective is unique , since conventional electroencephalography based on the visual examination of the tracing is not as objective. A systematic review was performed on the MEDLINE database in October 2017. The authors independently analyzed the studies , by title and abstract , and selected articles that met the inclusion criteria: comparative studies , not older than 30 years , that compared the use of conventional electroencephalogram ( EEG) with the use of quantitative electroencephalogram ( QEEG) in the English language. One hundred twelve articles were automatically selected by the MEDLINE search engine , but only six met the above criteria. The review found that given a 95 % confidence interval , QEEG had no statistically higher sensitivity than EEG in four of the six studies reviewed. However , these results must be viewed with appropriate caution , particularly as groups in between studies were not matched on important variables such as gender , age , type of illness , recovery stage , and treatment. The authors ' findings in this systematic review are suggestive of the importance of QEEG as an auxiliary tool to traditional EEG , and as such , justifying further refinement , standardization , and eventually the future execution of a head-to-head prospective study on comparing the two methods.
