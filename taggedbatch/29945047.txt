 Carbon-based material is commonly used for anodes in MFCs , but its low conductivity often limits anodic performance. Application of corrosion-resistive current collector to carbon-based anode can be a promising strategy for increasing the anodic performance. In this study , it was hypothesized increasing metal current collector improved anodic performance. Two different carbon-felt anodes with titanium wires ( CF-W) or stainless steel mesh ( CF-M) as a current collector were tested in a single chamber MFC. In the short-term tests such as polarization and impedance tests , CF-M with the larger current collector area ( 21.7 cm
