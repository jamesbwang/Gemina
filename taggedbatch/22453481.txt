 Bi-exponential decay of dye fluorescence near the surface of plasmonic metamaterials and core-shell nanoparticles is shown to be an intrinsic property of the coupled system. Indeed , the Dicke , cooperative states involve two groups of transitions: super-radiant , from the most excited to the ground states and sub-radiant , which can not reach the ground state. The relaxation in the sub-radiant system occurs mainly due to the interaction with the plasmon modes. Our theory shows that the relaxation leads to the population of the sub-radiant states by dephasing the super-radiant Dicke states giving rise to the bi-exponential decay in agreement with the experiments. We use a set of metamaterial samples consisting of gratings of paired silver nanostrips coated with Rh800 dye molecules , having resonances in the same spectral range. The bi-exponential decay is demonstrated for Au \ SiO
