 Patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA) persistence is associated , in prematures , to several complications. The optimal PDA management is still under debate , especially regarding the best therapeutic approach and the time to treat. The available drugs are not exempt from contraindications and side effects; ibuprofen itself , although representing the first-choice therapy , can show nephrotoxicity and other complications. Paracetamol seems a valid alternative to classic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs , with a lower toxicity. Areas covered: Through an analysis of the published literature on ibuprofen and paracetamol effects in preterm neonates , this review compares the available treatments for PDA , analyzing the mechanisms underlining ibuprofen-associated nephrotoxicity and the eventual paracetamol-induced hepatic damage , also providing an update of what has been yet demonstrated and a clear description of the still open issues. Expert Opinion: Paracetamol is an acceptable alternative in case of contraindication to ibuprofen; its toxicity , in this setting , is very low. Lower doses may be effective , with even fewer risks. In the future , paracetamol could represent an efficacious first-line therapy , although its safety , optimal dosage , and global impact have to be fully clarified through long-term trials , also in the perspective of an individualized and person-based therapy taking into account the extraordinary individual variability.
