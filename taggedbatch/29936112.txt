 Alcohol dependence is currently one of the most serious public health problems. Indeed , 3-8 % of all deaths worldwide are attributable to effects of alcohol consumption. Although the first step in alcohol dependence treatment is straightforward , the main problem for clinicians lies with the prevention of relapse , as 40-70 % of patients who only undergo psychosocial therapy resume alcohol use within a year following treatment. This review of the literature regarding event-related potentials ( ERPs) is focused on two major neurocognitive factors that partially account for the inability of many alcoholics to remain abstinent: attentional biases towards alcohol-related stimuli that increase the urge to drink , and impaired response inhibition towards these cues that makes it more difficult for alcoholics to resist the temptation to drink. On this basis , we propose new research avenues to better implement ERPs in the management of alcohol disorders , according to four main directions that relate to ( 1) the development of ERP serial recordings; ( 2) the promotion of a multi-component ERP approach; ( 3) the definition of multi-site guidelines; and ( 4) the use of more representative laboratory situations through the use of more compelling environments.
