 The Affordable Care Act ( ACA) of 2010 incentivized states to expand eligibility for their Medicaid programs. Many did so in 2014 , and there has been great interest in understanding the effects of these expansions on access to health care , health care utilization , and population health. To estimate the longer-term ( three-year) impact of Medicaid expansions on insurance coverage , access to care , preventive care , self-assessed health , and risky health behaviors. A difference-in-differences model , exploiting variation across states and over time in Medicaid expansion , was estimated using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ( BRFSS) for 2010-2016. Low-income childless adults aged 19-64 years in the BRFSS. Outcomes included insurance coverage , access to care , several forms of preventive care ( e.g. , routine checkups , flu shots , HIV<pathogen> tests , dental visits , and cancer screening) , risky health behaviors ( e.g. , smoking , alcohol abuse , obesity) , and self-assessed health. The previously documented benefits of Medicaid expansions on insurance coverage , access to care , preventive care , and self-assessed health have persisted 3 years after expansion. There was no detectable effect on risky health behaviors. The Affordable Care Act was motivated in part by a desire to increase health insurance coverage , improve access to care , and increase use of preventive care. The Medicaid expansions facilitated by the ACA are helping to achieve those objectives , and the benefits have persisted 3 years after expansion.
