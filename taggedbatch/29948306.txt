 Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis<disease> ( MPGN) is a rare chronic kidney disease associated with complement activation. Recent immunofluorescence-based classification distinguishes between immune complex ( IC)- mediated MPGN , with glomerular IgG and C3 deposits , and C3 glomerulopathies ( C3G) , with predominant C3 deposits. Genetic and autoimmune abnormalities causing hyperactivation of the complement alternative pathway have been found as frequently in patients with immune complex-associated MPGN ( IC-MPGN) as in those with C3G. In the last decade , there have been great advances in research into the autoimmune causes of IC-MPGN and C3G. The complement-activating autoantibodies called C3-nephritic factors ( C3NeFs) , which are present in 40-80 % of patients , form a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies that stabilise the C3 convertase or the C5 convertase of the alternative pathway or both. A few patients , mainly with IC-MPGN , carry autoantibodies directed against the two components of the alternative pathway C3 convertase , factors B and C3b. Finally , autoantibodies against factor H , the main regulator of the alternative pathway , have been reported in a small proportion of patients with IC-MPGN or C3G. The identification of distinct pathogenetic patterns leading to kidney injury and of targets in the complement cascade may pave the way for tailored therapies for IC-MPGN and C3G , with specific complement inhibitors in the development pipeline.
