 The objective was to analyze whether socioeconomic factors related to the context and those related to the model of care-specifically the coverage of primary care by the Family Health Strategy ( ESF)- had an impact on hospitalizations due to heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) and stroke , in the State of São Paulo/Brazil between 1998 and 2013. A longitudinal ecological study involving 645 municipalities was conducted in the state of São Paulo/Brazil from 1998 to 2013 , using the Hospital Information System ( SIH-DataSUS database). The hospitalizations for primary care sensitive conditions: Stroke and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) that correspond to the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD 10): I50 , I63 to I67; I69 , G45 to G46 were analyzed longitudinally during the period indicated regarding the percentage of people covered by the Family Health Program ( PSF) adjusted for confounders ( population size , gross domestic product- GDP and human development index- HDI). There was a significant decrease in the number of hospitalizations for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and stroke per 10000 ( inhabitants) in the period ( p < 0.0001) , with a significant relationship with increased proportion of ESF ( p < 0.0001) , and this remained significant even when possible confounders ( population size , GDP and HDI) were included in the model ( p < 0.0001). GDP per capita was close to or higher than that if many European countries , which shows the relevance of the study. The health care model based on the Family Health Strategy positively impacted hospitalization indicators for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and stroke , indicating that this model is effective in the prevention of primary care sensitive conditions.
