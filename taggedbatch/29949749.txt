 The crops and grains were often contaminated by high level of mycotoxin zearalenone ( ZEN). In order to remove ZEN and keep food safe , ZEN-degrading or detoxifying enzymes are urgently needed. Here , a newly identified lactonohydrolase responsible for the detoxification of ZEN , annotated as Zhd518 , was expressed and characterized. Zhd518 showed 65 % amino acid identity with Zhd101 , which was widely studied for its ZEN-degrading ability. A detailed activity measurement method of ZEN-degrading enzyme was provided. Biochemical analysis indicated that the purified recombinant Zhd518 from E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> exhibited a high activity against ZEN ( 207.0 U/mg) , with the optimal temperature and pH of 40 °C and 8.0 , respectively. The Zhd518 can degrade ZEN derivatives , and the specific activities against α-Zearalenol , β-Zearalenol , α-Zearalanol and β-Zearalanol were 23.0 U/mg , 64.7 U/mg , 119.8 U/mg and 66.5 U/mg , respectively. The active sites of Zhd518 were predicted by structure modeling and determined by mutation analysis. A point mutant N156H exhibited 3.3-fold activity against α-Zearalenol comparing to Zhd518. Zhd518 is the first reported neutral and the second characterized ZEN-degrading enzyme , which provides a new and more excellent candidate for ZEN detoxifying in food and feed industry.
