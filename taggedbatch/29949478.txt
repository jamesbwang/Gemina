 This study investigated the influence of thermal stress on the simulated localized and generalized wear of nanofilled resin composites. Six nanofilled resin composites were evaluated and then subjected to a wear challenge of 400,000 cycles in a Leinfelder-Suzuki ( Alabama) wear simulation device after 24 hours of water storage ( 24-hour group) and 24 hours of water storage and 10,000 thermal cycles ( TC group). Simulated localized wear was generated using a stainless-steel ball bearing , and simulated generalized wear was generated using a flat-ended stainless-steel cylinder. Wear testing was accomplished in a water slurry of polymethyl methacrylate beads. Simulated localized and generalized wear was determined using a noncontact profilometer ( Proscan 2100) in conjunction with Proscan and AnSur 3D software. Wear was significantly different ( p < 0.05) among the resin composites for both simulated localized and generalized wear of either the 24-hour group or the TC group. The simulated localized wear of the TC group was significantly greater than that of the 24-hour group; however , the simulated generalized wear of most of the resin composites of the TC group was not significantly different from that of the 24-hour group. The simulated localized and generalized wear of nanofilled resin composites is material dependent. The simulated localized wear of nanofilled resin composites appears to be influenced by thermal stress , whereas this effect is not as apparent in simulated generalized wear testing.
