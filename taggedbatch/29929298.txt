 A time-dependent environmental fate and food-web bioaccumulation model is developed to improve the evaluation of the behaviour of non-ionic hydrophobic organic pesticides in farm ponds. The performance of the model was tested by simulating the behaviour of 3 hydrophobic organic pesticides , i.e. , metaflumizone ( CAS Number: 139968-49-3) , kresoxim-methyl ( CAS Number: 144167-04-4) and pyraclostrobin ( CAS Number: 175013-18-0) , in microcosm studies and a Bluegill bioconcentration study for metaflumizone. In general , model-calculated concentrations of the pesticides were in reasonable agreement with the observed concentrations. Also , calculated bioaccumulation metrics were in good agreement with observed values. The model 's application to simulate concentrations of organic pesticides in water , sediment and biota of farm ponds after episodic pesticide applications is illustrated. It is further shown that the time dependent model has substantially better accuracy in simulating the concentrations of pesticides in farm ponds resulting from episodic pesticide application than corresponding steady-state models. The time dependent model is particularly useful in describing the behaviour of highly hydrophobic pesticides that have a potential to biomagnify in aquatic food-webs.
