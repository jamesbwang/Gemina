 A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR) in patients undergoing potentially curative gastrectomy for cancer ( GC). Thomson Reuters Web of Science , Ovid MEDLINE ( R) and PUBMED databases were searched for relevant articles using search terms neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR) , GC and survival. Articles reporting overall survival ( OS) , cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival ( DFS) , in patients undergoing R0 gastrectomy , were studied. Articles numbering 365 were identified during the preliminary search , and 10 containing 4164 patients were included in the final review. Most patients were > 60 years of age , male ( 67 %) and 2239 ( 53.8 %) had pT3 disease. The number of NLR dichotomization thresholds reported numbered 7 , with 2.00 and 3.00 ( n = 2) the most common. NLR was associated with poor survival in eight studies with hazard ratios ranging from 1.54 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.26-1.89) to 2.99 ( 1.99-4.49). Pooled odds ratio ( OR) for OS was 2.31 ( 1.40-3.83 , p = 0.001) and for DFS 2.72 ( 1.14-6.54 , p = 0.020). Four studies presented T-stage data , OR 1.62 ( 1.33-1.96 , p < 0.001). NLR is an important prognostic indicator associated with both OS and DFS after R0 resection of GC , but the critical level is equivocal.
