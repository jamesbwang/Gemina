 To evaluate combined individual- and community-level interventions to reduce underage drinking by American Indian/Alaska Native ( AI/AN) youths on rural California Indian reservations. Individual-level interventions included brief motivational interviewing and psychoeducation for Tribal youths. Community-level interventions included community mobilization and awareness activities , as well as restricting alcohol sales to minors. To test effects , we compared 7 waves of California Healthy Kids Survey data ( 2002-2015) for 9th- and 11th-grade AI/AN and non-AI/AN students in intervention area schools with California AI/AN students outside the intervention area ( n = 617 , n = 33469 , and n = 976 , respectively). Pre- to postintervention mean past 30-day drinking frequency declined among current drinkers in the intervention group ( 8.4-6.3 days) relative to comparison groups. Similarly , heavy episodic drinking frequency among current drinkers declined in the intervention group ( 7.0-4.8 days) versus the comparison groups. This study documented significant , sustained past 30-day drinking or heavy episodic drinking frequency reductions among AI/AN 9th- and 11th-grade current drinkers in rural California Indian reservation communities exposed to multilevel interventions. Public Health Implications. Multilevel community-partnered interventions can effectively reduce underage alcohol use in this population.
