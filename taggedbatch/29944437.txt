 Unrepaired DNA damage hinders the maintenance of genome integrity because it blocks the catalytic activity of replicase. The stalled replication fork can be processed through either translesion synthesis ( TLS) with specific polymerases , or replication using the undamaged template. To investigate how TLS activities are regulated and how the stalled replication fork is processed in plants , reversion frequencies and homologous recombination ( HR) frequencies were analyzed using GUS-based substrates. The HR frequencies in plants deficient in DNA polymerase ζ ( Pol ζ) or Rev1 were higher than that in wildtype plants under normal conditions , and were significantly increased by ultraviolet light irradiation. Heat shock<symptom> protein ( HSP) 90 is known to be involved in various stress responses. To examine the role of HSP90 in the regulation of damage tolerance , we analyzed reversion frequencies and HR frequencies in plants grown in the presence of a HSP inhibitor , geldanamycin ( GDA). Reversion frequency was lower in GDA-treated plants than in mock-treated plants. Though the HR frequency was higher in GDA-treated wildtype plants than in mock-treated plants , no significant difference was detected in Rev1-deficient plants. In yeast , TLS polymerases interacted with each other or with a replication clump component , proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA). HSP90 interacted with REV1 or REV7 in Nicotiana benthamiana cells. These results suggest that HSP90 interacts with TLS polymerase ( s) , which promotes error-prone TLS in plants.
