 In order to broaden the antimicrobial action spectrum of lysozyme against Gram-negative bacteria , different partially reduced lysozyme derivatives were obtained by reducing the R-S-S-R bonds of lysozyme using the reducing agent Na2SO3. The circular dichroism behavior analysis showed that the tertiary structure of the partially reduced lysozyme molecules became more flexible , leading to an obvious increase in the surface hydrophobicity and the tryptophan fluorescence intensity. Zeta potential analysis indicated that the introduction of SO32- led to a decrease in the surface charges of the reduced lysozyme molecules. Compared with the native lysozyme , the reduced lysozymes not only showed a 1 log increase in the antimicrobial activity against Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ATCC 25922 and Salmonella<pathogen><disease> enteritidis<pathogen> ATCC 13076 ( P < 0.05) , but also maintained nearly the same antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ATCC 29213 ( P > 0.05). Overall , the reductive modification with the food-friendly , compatible , and safe reducing agent Na2SO3 has broadened the antimicrobial action spectrum of the modified lysozymes against Gram-negative bacteria , with the enhancement extent depending on the reduction degree and the type of bacterial strains. The integrated results suggest that the Na2SO3-reduced lysozyme can be used as a novel safe potential bactericidal additive for food-processing industry.
