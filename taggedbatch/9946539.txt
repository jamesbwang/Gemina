 This paper reviews confinement-driven phase transitions in superconductors and Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superfluids , and the appearance in thin films of new phases that break the time-reversal or translational symmetry. The origins of the new phases are closely tied to the Andreev scattering processes involving particle-hole conversions that create surface quasiparticle states with energies inside the superconducting gap. Restructuring of the low-energy spectrum in the surface region of several coherence lengths
