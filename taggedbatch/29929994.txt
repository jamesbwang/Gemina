 UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 ( UGT2B7) is one of the most significant isoforms of UGTs in human liver. This research measured UGT2B7 protein content and activities including Vmax and CLint in human liver at isoform , microsomal , liver tissue , and liver levels and identified the factors that influence expression. We determined absolute protein content by LC-MS/MS and activities using the probe drug Zidovudine in 82 normal human liver microsomes. Using a bottom-up method for derivation , we showed UGT2B7 content at the microsomal , liver tissue , and liver levels , as well as activities at the isoform , microsomal , liver tissue , and liver levels in vitro , and predicted hepatic clearance in vivo , with median , range , variation , and 95 and 50 % prediction intervals. With regard to the intrinsic activities , the Vmax had a median ( range) of 7.5 ( 2-24) pmol/min/pmol 2B7 and the CLint was 0.08 ( 0.02-0.31) Âµl/min/pmol 2B7. Determinations at liver level showed larger variations than at microsomal level , so it was more suitable for evaluating individual differences. By analyzing factors that affect UGT2B7 , we found that: 1) the content at the liver tissue and liver levels correlated positively with activities; 2) the mutant heterozygotes of -327 G > A , -900 A > G , -161 C > T may lead to decreased protein content and increased intrinsic CLint; and 3) the transcription factor pregnane X receptor ( PXR) mRNA expression level was positively associated with the measured protein content. In all , we showed protein content and activities at different levels and the factors that influence content to provide valuable information for UGT2B7 research and clinically individualized medication.
