 Neuroblastoma ( NB) is an embryonic malignancy affecting the physiological development of adrenal medulla and paravertebral sympathetic ganglia in early infancy. Proteasome inhibitors ( PIs) ( i.e. , carfilzomib ( CFZ)) may represent a possible pharmacological treatment for solid tumors including NB. In the present study , we tested the effect of a novel non-competitive inhibitor of heme oxygenase-1 ( HO-1) , LS1/71 , as a possible adjuvant therapy for the efficacy of CFZ in neuroblastoma cells. Our results showed that CFZ increased both HO-1 gene expression ( about 18-fold) and HO activity ( about 8-fold) , following activation of the ER stress pathway. The involvement of HO-1 in CFZ-mediated cytotoxicity was further confirmed by the protective effect of pharmacological induction of HO-1 , significantly attenuating cytotoxicity. In addition , HO-1 selective inhibition by a specific siRNA increased the cytotoxic effect following CFZ treatment in NB whereas SnMP , a competitive pharmacological inhibitor of HO , showed no changes in cytotoxicity. Our data suggest that treatment with CFZ produces ER stress in NB without activation of CHOP-mediated apoptosis , whereas co-treatment with CFZ and LS1/71 led to apoptosis activation and CHOP expression induction. In conclusion , our study showed that treatment with the non-competitive inhibitor of HO-1 , LS1/ 71 , increased cytotoxicity mediated by CFZ , triggering apoptosis following ER stress activation. These results suggest that PIs may represent a possible pharmacological treatment for solid tumors and that HO-1 inhibition may represent a possible strategy to overcome chemoresistance and increase the efficacy of chemotherapic regimens.
