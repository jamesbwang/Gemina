 To evaluate the renoprotective effects of canagliflozin , we assessed the albuminuria-lowering effect in Japanese type 2 diabetes patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD). In this prospective , open-label , parallel-group study , type 2 diabetes patients with CKD were randomized to receive either oral canagliflozin ( 100 mg/day) or usual care ( control group) for 52 weeks. Endpoints included changes in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ( UACR) , other urinary biomarkers , laboratory parameters , and adverse events. Both groups included 20 patients in the analysis. Mean changes in UACR was -83 ( -266 to -31) mg/gCr and 27 ( -11 to 131) mg/gCr , in the canagliflozin and control groups , respectively ( p = 0.004). Urinary liver-type free acid binding protein , N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase , and β Canagliflozin was associated with slower progression of kidney disease and reduction in albuminuria and tubulointerstitial markers in diabetes patients with CKD.
