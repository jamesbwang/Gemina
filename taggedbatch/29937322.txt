 Although unset mineral trioxide aggregate ( MTA) has some cytotoxicity , MTA is still a biocompatible material suitable for doing apexification. This study assessed the outcomes for 8 necrotic immature open-apex permanent maxillary central incisors treated by MTA apexification using poly ( ε-caprolactone) fiber mesh ( PCL-FM) as an apical barrier ( so-called PCL-FM/MTA apexification) to prevent extrusion of MTA materials into the periapical tissues of open-apex teeth. Eight necrotic immature open-apex permanent maxillary central incisors with the open apices measuring 2.5 mm-3.5 mm in diameter in 8 patients ( 6 boys and 2 girls; age range , 8-10 years) were first cleaned using ultrasonic activated irrigation with 2.5 % sodium hypochlorite solution and then treated by PCL-FM/MTA apexification procedure. All the 8 permanent maxillary central incisors showed successful outcomes after PCL-FM/MTA apexification procedure. The mean duration for apical hard tissue barrier formation of the 8 incisors was 6.8 ± 0.5 weeks ( range 6-7 weeks). The mean increased root length was 1.8 ± 0.7 mm ( range 1-3 mm) at 7 weeks and 3.1 ± 0.6 mm ( range 2-4 mm) at 3 months. The mean increased dentinal wall thickness at the most apical portion of the root was 1.3 ± 0.5 mm ( range 1-2 mm) at 7 weeks and 2.4 ± 0.6 mm ( range 1.5-3 mm) at 3 months. None of the teeth treated by PCL-FM/MTA apexification showed tooth discoloration after a follow-up period of 3 months. PCL-FM/MTA apexification is an excellent technique for treatment of necrotic immature open-apex permanent maxillary central incisors.
