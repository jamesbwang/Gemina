 Mitochondria play a key role in a variety of physiological processes , and mitochondria-targeting drug delivery is helpful and effective in cancer therapy. Rhodamine123 ( Rhod123) and Doxorubicin ( Dox) are not new chemical molecules , and they both can inhibit the growth of cancerous cells. Here , we combine these two `` old '' chemicals with polydopamine nanoparticles ( PDA NPs) to strengthen the antitumor effect with the aid of near-infrared irradiation. PDA NPs carry these two chemicals tightly by hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking besides chemical bonds. The better antitumor profile of PDA-Rhod-Dox comes from the mitochondria-targeting delivery , which decreases ATP in living cells , causing apoptosis of cancerous cells effectively and inhibiting the growth of tumors in mice. The synergistic effect of PDA , Rhod123 , and Dox improves the treatment effect of conventional chemotherapy drugs.
