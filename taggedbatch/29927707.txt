 Throughout evolutionary history in the kingdom Fungi<pathogen> , taxa have exchanged genetic information among species , as revealed in particular by analyses of genome sequences. In fungi<pathogen> , hybridization can occur by sexual mating or by fusion of vegetative structures giving rise to new species or leaving traces of introgression in the genome. Furthermore , gene exchange can occur by horizontal gene transfer between species and can even include organisms outside the kingdom Fungi<pathogen>. In several cases , interspecific gene exchange has been instrumental in rapid adaptive evolution of fungal species and has notably played a role in the emergence of new pathogens. Here we summarize mechanisms and examples of gene exchange in fungi<pathogen> with a particular focus on the genomic context. We emphasize the need for and potential of applying population genetic approaches to better understand the processes and the impact of interspecific gene exchange in rapid adaptive evolution and species diversification. The broad occurrence of gene exchange among fungal species challenges our species concepts in the kingdom Fungi<pathogen>.
