 Historically , B cells have been considered as positive regulators of humoral immune responses. Specific B-cell subsets , however , negatively regulate immune responses and are termed `` regulatory B cells '' ( Bregs). Recently , Bregs have been linked to not only inflammatory and autoimmune diseases , but also malignancies via suppressing anti-tumour immunity. To investigate the involvement of Bregs in advanced mycosis<disease> fungoides ( MF). The frequency of CD19 The frequency of CD19 The development of IL-10-producing Bregs is impaired in patients with advanced MF and a decrease in IL-10-producing Bregs may play an important role in the progression of advanced MF.
