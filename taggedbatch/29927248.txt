 Plasmon-free surface enhanced Raman scattering ( SERS) based on the chemical mechanism ( CM) is drawing great attention due to its capability for controllable molecular detection. However , in comparison to the conventional noble-metal-based SERS technique driven by plasmonic electromagnetic mechanism ( EM) , the low sensitivity in the CM-based SERS is the dominant barrier toward its practical applications. Herein , we demonstrate the 1T ' transition metal telluride atomic layers ( WTe
