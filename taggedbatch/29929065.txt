 A three-week trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of leonardite and lignite , natural sources of humic substances , on selected indicators of health status of weaned piglets. A total of 45 weaned piglets were assigned to three dietary treatments: Control- basal diet without any medication; Leonardite or Lignite- diet supplemented with lignite or leonardite at a dose of 20 g/kg , respectively. Leonardite differed from lignite in the content of humic substances and minerals. Diarrhoea<disease> incidence and severity , growth performance , haematological and biochemical status , biomarkers of oxidative stress , serum fatty acid ( FA) profile and faecal microbiota composition were monitored. Significantly lower faecal score , diarrhoea<disease> incidence , serum biomarkers of oxidative stress , higher body<symptom> weight gain and no mortality were observed in leonardite and lignite group. The supplemented groups had or tended to have higher haematocrit , haemoglobin , erythrocyte counts , iron , cholesterol and lower urea in blood. Increased serum minerals ( calcium , phosphorus , magnesium) were detected in the leonardite group. Different effects of leonardite and lignite on serum FA profile were detected. Significantly lower proportion of saturated FA , higher unsaturated , monounsaturated , polyunsaturated ( PUFA) n-3 FA and PUFA n6/n3 ratio were detected in leonardite group compared to lignite group. Both treatments decreased microbial diversity and richness of faecal microbiota at the genus level. Specifically , lower relative abundance of Firmicutes , Bacteroides , Anaerovibrio , Oscillospira , SMB53 , Ruminococcus , and a tendency to a higher abundance of Prevotella was found compared to control group. Natural humic materials may provide benefit to piglets ' heath in the difficult post-weaning period.
