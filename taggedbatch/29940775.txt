 The early-stage diagnosis and treatment for the recurrence of larynx carcinoma needs further investigation. Mesenchyme homeobox 2 ( MEOX2) was speculated as a novel suppressor gene in larynx carcinoma in our study , the molecular mechanism was studied. Real-time quantitative PCR ( RT-qPCR) and Western blot were used to detect mRNA and protein levels of MEOX2 in laryngeal cancer tissues and cells ( Hep-2 , TU212 , AMC-NH-8 and TU686 cells) , and also apoptosis and phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K)/ protein kinase ( Akt) related factors in TU212 cells transfected with MEOX2. Cell counting kit-8 ( CCK8) assay and Annexin-Ⅴ/PI staining assay were conducted to determine cell viability and apoptosis rates respectively .46 patients with larynx carcinoma were involved in this study. The expression of MEOX2 was lower in larynx carcinoma tissues than normal tissues , correlated with clinical stages , differentiated degrees , and survival times. The expression of MEOX2 was the lowest among those laryngeal cancer cells and was chosen to be transfected with MEOX2 in the following study. Over-expression of MEOX2 inhibited cell viability and promoted apoptosis of TU212 cells , via increasing the expression levels of Caspase-3 , and decreasing levels of C-Myc , XIAP , PI3K p110α , PI3K p110β , PI3K class III and p-Akt. In summary , the expression levels of MEOX2 were inhibited in larynx carcinoma than normal tissues , correlated with the progression of the cancer. Over-expression of MEOX2 in laryngeal cancer cells inhibited cell viability and promoted apoptosis , via regulating apoptosis and PI3K/Akt pathway related factors. It would provide evidence for MEOX2 to be used as a therapeutical gene in larynx carcinoma.
