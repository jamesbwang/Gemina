 Uncertainties can be defined as the gaps of knowledge and/or of data sets and/or of methodologies that can exert an unwanted influence on the outcome of a risk assessment. In principle , uncertainties are unavoidable , and thus , a transparent description and weighing of relevant uncertainties should be a necessary component of risk assessment. Examples are provided of uncertainty analysis in recent opinions of the European Food Safety Authority concerning additives , pesticides , and contaminants. Whereas it is difficult to quantify the impact of each specific uncertainty on the outcome , it should be possible to quantify the combined effect of identified uncertainties; also , a stepwise approach may be envisaged , focusing on those issues where a detailed appraisal of uncertainties is needed. On a more general ground , consideration of uncertainty and its sources meets the general requirement for transparency in scientific assessment.
