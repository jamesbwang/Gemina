 We sought to determine the impact of time after surgery on quality of life ( QoL) and body image in breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy. Female patients with unilateral breast cancer who had undergone mastectomy were surveyed regarding their body image ( Body Image After Breast Cancer Questionnaire; BIBCQ) and QoL ( FACT-B). Data were analyzed using nonparametric statistics ( SPSS version 24). Ninety-four of the 109 patients approached completed both surveys ( 86.2 % response rate). Median patient age at the time of surgery was 49.5 ( range 29-82); the survey was administered at a median of 14.2 months postoperatively ( range 0.3-192.1 months). Seventy-four patients ( 78.7 %) had reconstruction , and 52 patients ( 55.3 %) chose to undergo contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Patients who reported an above average overall body image perception on the BIBCQ tended to be further out from their surgery than those who reported a below average perception ( median 20.9 vs. 8.1 months , respectively , p = 0.009). Patients who reported above average QoL also tended to be further out from their surgery compared with those with below average overall QoL ( median 21.8 vs. 6.4 months , respectively , p = 0.004). Receipt of reconstruction , contralateral prophylactic mastectomy , disease stage , patient race , education , insurance type , income , marital status , employment status , and age at surgery did not significantly affect body image nor QoL in this cohort. Better body image perception and higher QoL were associated with being further out from surgery. These findings suggest that body image and QoL may improve with time , as patients acclimatize to their `` new normal. ''
