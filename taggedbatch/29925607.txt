 This article reinvigorates a key question in publication ethics: Is there research that it is permissible to conduct but that ought not to be published? The article raises the question in relation to two recent medical studies. It is argued ( 1) that the publication of these studies may cause significant harm to individuals , ( 2) that editors of medical journals have a moral responsibility for such harm , ( 3) that denial of publication is inadequate as an instrument to fulfil this moral responsibility and ( 4) that internationally acknowledged publication ethics codes should incorporate this aspect of editors ' moral responsibility.
