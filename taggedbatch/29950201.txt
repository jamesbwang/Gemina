 To investigate the relationship between early peak body temperature and neutropenia duration and its potential mechanism. A total of 111 patients with CR1 phase acute leukemia<disease> ( AL) with neutropenia infection were enrolled in this study. The relationship between early peak body temperature and neutropenia duration was analyzed retrospectively , and the IL-6 serum level in patients with different peak of body temperature was detected , and the single cell culture system in vitro was established , the incorparation rate of EdU in vivo was detected , and the effect of IL-6 on mouse hematopoietic stem cells/ progenitor cells was analyzed. Out of 111 patients with nentropenia , the body temperature < 38 °C and the neutropenia duration 9.5 ± 3.69 d were observed in 44 patients , while the body temperature > 38 °C and neutropenia duration 7.33 ± 4.20 d were observed in 69 patients , the differences between 2 groups was statistically signficant ( P < 0.05). The EdU test showed that the number of EdU For patients with neutropenic infection when initial body temperature peak is < 38 °C , the probability of neutropenia duration prolonging after chamotherapy increases , which may relate with promotive effect of pro-inflammatory cytokins on prliferation of hematopoietic stem cells/progenitor cells.
