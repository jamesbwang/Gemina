 Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates cellular stress response and irinotecan-metabolising pathways. Its aberrant activity has been reported in a number of cancers , although relatively few studies have explored a role for Nrf2 in colorectal cancer ( CRC). This study assessed the expression of Nrf2 in patient CRC tissues and explored the effect of Nrf2 modulation alone , or in combination with irinotecan , in human ( HCT116) and murine ( CT26) cell lines
