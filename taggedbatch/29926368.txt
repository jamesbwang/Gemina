 Chronic inflammation<symptom> is an obvious risk factor of atherosclerotic diseases , and the presence of periodontal<disease> disease<disease> is one of the important sources of chronic inflammation<symptom> in patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD) and diabetes mellitus ( DM). Thus , we aimed to investigate the effects of non-surgical periodontal therapy of the patients undergoing CAPD due to diabetic nephropathy , diabetic patients without CKD , and healthy controls on inflammation<symptom> exponents. Thirty-two CAPD patients due to diabetic nephropathy ( group III) , 31 diabetic patients without nephropathy ( group II) , and 38 healthy subjects ( group I) were enrolled to the study. All patients enrolled to the study ( to all groups) suffered from chronic periodontitis<disease>. Plaque index , Gingival index , pocket depth ( PD) measurements were recorded before and after periodontal therapy. All blood samples for biochemical parameters were measured by using standard laboratory techniques with an automatic analyser. Blood samples for TNF-α , IL-6 , and PTX-3 were centrifuged , and separated serum and plasma samples were stored at- 80 °C until analysis. All inflammatory markers were significantly higher in group III than the other two at baseline. TNF-α levels were significantly decreased after periodontal treatment at 3-month visit in all groups. PTX-3 , IL-6 , and Hs-CRP levels were significantly reduced after periodontal treatment at 3 months in group III. Periodontal<disease> disease<disease> is an important source of inflammation<symptom> in diabetic CAPD patients and treatment of periodontal<disease> disease<disease> can be monitored by inflammatory markers including TNF-alpha , PTX-3 , IL-6 , and Hs-CRP. TNF-alpha may be useful and more sensitive monitoring inflammation<symptom> in healthy patients and diabetic patients after periodontal treatment.
