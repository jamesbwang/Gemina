 Photoacoustic imaging ( PAI) is a rapidly growing field which offers high spatial resolution and high contrast for deep-tissue imaging in vivo. PAI is non-ionizing , non-invasive and combines the optical resolution of fluorescence imaging with the spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging. In particular , the development of exogenous PA contrast agents has gained significant momentum of late with a vastly expanding complexity of dye materials under investigation ranging from small molecules , to macromolecular proteins , polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles. The goal of this review is to survey the current state-of-the-art in molecular photoacoustic contrast agents ( MPACs) for applications in biomedical imaging. The fundamental design principles of MPACs is presented and a review of prior reports spanning from early-to-current literature is put forth. This article is protected by copyright.
