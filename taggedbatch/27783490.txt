 Lithium-sulfur ( Li-S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems for next-generation electric vehicles because of their high-energy density. However , the poor cyclic stability , especially at a high sulfur loading , is the major obstacles retarding their practical use. Inspired by the nacre structure of an abalone , a similar configuration consisting of layered carbon nanotube ( CNT) matrix and compactly embedded sulfur is designed as the cathode for Li-S batteries , which are realized by a well-designed unidirectional freeze-drying approach. The compact and lamellar configuration with closely contacted neighboring CNT layers and the strong interaction between the highly conductive network and polysulfides have realized a high sulfur loading with significantly restrained polysulfide shuttling , resulting in a superior cyclic stability and an excellent rate performance for the produced Li-S batteries. Typically , with a sulfur loading of 5 mg cm
