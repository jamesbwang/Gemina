 Following inflammation<symptom> or injury , sensory neurons located in the dorsal root ganglia ( DRG) may exhibit increased spontaneous and/or stimulus-evoked activity , contributing to chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Current treatment options for peripherally-mediated chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> are highly limited , driving the development of cell- or tissue-based phenotypic ( function-based) screening assays for peripheral analgesic and mechanistic lead discovery. Extant assays are often limited by throughput , content , use of tumorigenic cell lines , or tissue sources from immature developmental stages ( i.e. , embryonic or post-natal). Here , we describe a protocol for culturing adult mouse DRG neurons on substrate-integrated multiwell microelectrode arrays ( MEAs). This approach enables multiplexed measurements of spontaneous as well as stimulus-evoked extracellular action potentials from large populations of cells. The DRG cultures exhibit stable spontaneous activity from 9 to 21 days in vitro ( DIV). Activity is readily evoked by known chemical and physical agonists of sensory neuron activity , such as capsaicin , bradykinin , PGE2 , heat , and electric field stimulation. Most importantly , we demonstrate that both spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity may be potentiated by incubation with the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 ( IL6). Acute responsiveness to IL6 is inhibited by treatment with a MNK1/2 inhibitor cercosporamide. In total , these findings suggest that adult mouse DRG neurons on multiwell MEAs are applicable to ongoing efforts to discover peripheral analgesic and their mechanisms of action.
