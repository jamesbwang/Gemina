 A DNA microarray-based assay for the detection of antimicrobial resistance ( AMR) genes was used to study carbapenemase-producing organisms at the Kidney Center of Rawalpindi , Pakistan. The evaluation of this assay was performed using 97 reference strains with confirmed AMR genes. Testing of 7,857 clinical samples identified 425 Gram-negative bacteria out of which 82 appeared carbapenem resistant. These isolates were analyzed using VITEK-2 for phenotyping and the described AMR assay for genotyping. The most prevalent carbapenemase gene was blaNDM and in 12 isolates we detected two carbapenemase genes ( e.g. , blaNDM/blaOXA -48). Our prevalence data from Pakistan show that- as in other parts of the world- carbapenemase-producing organisms with different underlying resistance mechanisms are emerging , and this warrants intensified and constant surveillance.
