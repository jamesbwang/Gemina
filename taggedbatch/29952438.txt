 Ongoing investigation is needed into feasible approaches which reduce excess weight in childhood. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of an adapted version of the Scottish Childhood Overweight Treatment Trial ( SCOTT) in an Irish primary care setting. Families were offered monthly dietitian-led sessions for six months. These sessions targeted dietary habits , family meals , screen time and exercise. Of the 95 children ( mean age 7.6 years) referred , 90.5 % ( n86) were obese and 9.5 % ( n9) were overweight. Fifty-one ( 53.7 %) families opted into the programme from referral , and 18 completed the programme ( 64.7 % attrition). Statistically significant reductions in body mass index ( BMI) were observed between sessions one and six ( 25.7 ± 4.2 kg/m2 and 25.3 ± 4.8 kg/m2 , respectively , p < 0.01). BMI z-score modestly decreased by 0.2 ( p = 0.01). Despite these reductions , issues with programme referral , attrition and long-term effectiveness were evident. Further investigation into strategies which reduce paediatric overweight is warranted.
