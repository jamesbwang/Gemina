 Upon activation , platelets release a powerful cocktail of soluble and vesicular signals , collectively termed the `` platelet releasate '' ( PR). Although several studies have used qualitative/quantitative proteomic approaches to characterize PR; with debated content and significant inter-individual variability reported , confident , and reliable insights have been hindered. Using label-free quantitative ( LFQ)- proteomics analysis , a reproducible , quantifiable investigation of the 1U mL
