 Chicken body<symptom> weight ( BW) is an economically important trait , and many studies have been conducted on genetic selection for BW. However , previous studies have detected functional chromosome mutations or regions using gene chips. The present study used the specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing ( SLAF-seq) technology to perform a genome-wide association study ( GWAS) on purebred Wengshang Barred chicken. A total of 1,286,715 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) were detected , and 175,211 SNPs were selected as candidate SNPs for genome-wide association analysis using TASSEL general linear models. Six SNP markers reached genome-wide significance. Of these , rs732048524 , rs735522839 , rs738991545 , and rs15837818 were significantly associated with body<symptom> weight at 28 days ( BW28) , while rs314086457 and rs315694878 were significantly associated with BW120. These SNPs are close to seven genes ( PRSS23 , ME3 , FAM181B , NABP1 , SDPR , TSSK6L2 , and RBBP8). Moreover , 24 BW-associated SNPs reached `` suggestive '' genome-wide significance. Of these , 6 , 13 , 1 , and 4 SNPs were associated with BW28 , BW56 , BW80 , and BW120 , respectively. These results would enrich the studies on BW and promote the use of Chinese chicken , especially the Wenshang Barred chicken.
