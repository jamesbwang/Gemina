 Psychiatric patients have a greater risk of premature mortality , predominantly due to cardiovascular diseases ( CVDs). Convincing evidence shows that psychiatric conditions are characterized by an increased risk of metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> ( MetS) , a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors including dyslipidemia , abdominal obesity , hypertension , and hyperglycemia. This increased risk is present for a range of psychiatric conditions , including major depressive disorder ( MDD) , bipolar disorder ( BD) , schizophrenia , anxiety<symptom> disorder , attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) , and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD). There is some evidence for a dose-response association with the severity and duration of symptoms and for a bidirectional longitudinal impact between psychiatric disorders and MetS. Associations generally seem stronger with abdominal obesity and dyslipidemia dysregulations than with hypertension. Contributing mechanisms are an unhealthy lifestyle and a poor adherence to medical regimen , which are prevalent among psychiatric patients. Specific psychotropic medications have also shown a profound impact in increasing MetS dysregulations. Finally , pleiotropy in genetic vulnerability and pathophysiological mechanisms , such as those leading to the increased central and peripheral activation of immunometabolic or endocrine systems , plays a role in both MetS and psychiatric disorder development. The excess risk of MetS and its unfavorable somatic health consequences justifies a high priority for future research , prevention , close monitoring , and treatment to reduce MetS in the vulnerable psychiatric patient.
