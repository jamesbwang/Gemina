 Although evidence-based , the 5A 's ( Ask , Advise , Assess , Assist , and Arrange) for smoking cessation are often incompletely delivered by primary care providers. This study examines whether a computer tablet 5A 's intervention improves primary care provider adherence to the 5A 's. Cluster RCT. All primary care providers in three urban , adult primary care clinics were randomized for participation. Any English- or Spanish-speaking patient with a primary care appointment who had smoked > 100 lifetime cigarettes and at least one cigarette in the past week was eligible. A cluster RCT comparing computer-facilitated 5A 's with usual care assessed effects on provider adherence to each of the 5A 's as determined by patient report. Intervention subjects used a computer tablet to complete the 5A 's immediately before a primary care appointment. A tailored , patient handout and a structured , clinician guide were generated. Data were collected in 2014-2015 and analyzed in 2016-2017. Provider adherence to the 5A 's. Providers ( N = 221) saw 961 patients ( n = 412 intervention , n = 549 control) for a total of n = 1,340 encounters with n = 1,011 completed post-visit interviews ( 75.4 % completion). Intervention providers had significantly higher odds of completing Assess ( AOR = 1.32 , 95 % CI = 1.02 , 1.73) and Assist ( AOR = 1.45 , 95 % CI = 1.08 , 1.94). When looking at first study visits only , intervention providers had higher odds for Arrange ( AOR = 1.72 , 95 % CI = 1.23 , 2.40) and all 5A 's ( AOR = 2.04 , 95 % CI = 1.35 , 3.07) but study visit did not influence receipt of the other 5A 's. A computer-facilitated 5A 's delivery model was effective in improving the fidelity of provider-delivered 5A 's to diverse primary care patients. This relatively low-cost , time-saving intervention has great potential for smoking cessation and other health behaviors. Future studies should identify ways to promote and sustain technology implementation. This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02046408.
