 While people often think they veridically perceive much of the visual surround , recent findings indicate that when asked to detect targets such as gratings embedded in visual noise , observers make more false alarms in the unattended periphery. Do these results from psychophysics studies generalize to more ecologically valid settings? We used a modern game engine to create a simulated driving environment where participants ( as drivers) had to make judgments about the colors of pedestrians ' clothing in the periphery. Confirming our hypothesis based on previous psychophysics studies , we found that subjects showed liberal biases for unattended locations when detecting specific colors of pedestrians ' clothing. A second experiment showed that this finding was not simply due to a confirmation bias in decision-making when subjects were uncertain. Together , these results support the idea that in everyday visual experience , there is subjective inflation of experienced detail in the periphery , which may happen at the decisional level.
