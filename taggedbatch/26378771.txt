 Lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles ( UCNPs) are capable of converting near-infra-red excitation into visible and ultraviolet emission. Their unique optical properties have advanced a broad range of applications , such as fluorescent microscopy , deep-tissue bioimaging , nanomedicine , optogenetics , security labelling and volumetric display. However , the constraint of concentration quenching on upconversion luminescence has hampered the nanoscience community to develop bright UCNPs with a large number of dopants. This review surveys recent advances in developing highly doped UCNPs , highlights the strategies that bypass the concentration quenching effect , and discusses new optical properties as well as emerging applications enabled by these nanoparticles.
