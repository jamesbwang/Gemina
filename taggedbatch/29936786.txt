 Objective: Mammographic density is an important risk factor for breast cancer and determines to a large extent mammographic screening efficacy. This study aims to provide baseline data for mammographic density profiling of women living in Ras Al Khaimah ( RAK) and to identify risk factors associated with high mammographic density. Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to examine a series of 366 mammography cases. The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System ( BI-RADS , 5th edition) was used to evaluate mammographic density. Pearson 's chi-squared , Mann-Whitney U test and multivariate logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. Results: Most participants ( 67 %) fell into BI-RADS b and c mammographic density categories. Of the total sample , women who were aged ≤ 45 years ( p = 0.004 , OR = 1.9) , weighed ≤ 71 kg ( p = < 0.0001 , OR = 4.8) , had a body mass index of ≤ 27 kg/m2 ( p = < 0.0001 , OR = 5.1) and were of non-Arab descent ( p = 0.007 , OR = 1.8) were significantly more likely to have denser breast tissue. Adjusted ethnicity regression analysis showed that Emirati women were significantly less likely to have dense breast tissue compared with Western women ( p = 0.04 , OR = 0.4). Among the sample of survey participants , increased odds of having mammographic density were among women who were full-time workers ( p = 0.02 , OR = 2.8) , of Christian faith ( p = 0.007 , OR = 4.4) , nulliparous ( p = 0.003 , OR = 10.8) , had three or fewer children ( p = 0.03 , OR = 3.8) , and had used oral contraceptives for three years or more ( p = 0.01 , OR = 6.1). Conclusion: This study indicated that because Emirati women have a low mammographic density profile , screening mammography can be considered as an effective early detection imaging modality.
