 We have previously evaluated and reported numerous classes of linear and cyclic peptides containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments for intracellular delivery of multiple molecular cargos. Herein , a combination of histidine and tryptophan amino acids were designed and evaluated for their efficiency in intracellular delivery of cell-impermeable phosphopeptides and the anti-HIV drug , emtricitabine. Two new decapeptides , with linear and cyclic natures , both containing alternate tryptophan and histidine residues , were synthesized using Fmoc/tBu solid-phase chemistry. The peptides were characterized and purified by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization ( MALDI) spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) , respectively. These peptides did not show significant toxicity up to 100 & micro; M in ovarian cancer ( SK-OV-3) and leukemia<disease> cancer ( CCRF-CEM) cells. Furthermore , the cellular uptake of a fluorescence ( F & rsquo ;-RRB-- labeled cell-impermeable phosphopeptide ( F & rsquo;- GpYEEI) was enhanced in the presence of linear ( WH) ₅ and cyclic ( WH) ₅ by 2- and 8-fold , respectively , compared to the uptake of the phosphopeptide alone. The cellular uptake was not significantly changed in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors. Furthermore , the intracellular uptake of the fluorescently-labeled anti-HIV drug , emtricitabine ( F & rsquo;- FTC) , by linear ( WH) ₅ and cyclic ( WH) ₅ in SK-OV-3 cancer cell lines was found to be enhanced by 3.5- and 9-fold , respectively , compared to that of the drug alone. Fluorescent uptake experiments confirmed the localization of F & rsquo;- GpYEEI-loaded cyclic ( WH) ₅ intracellularly in the SK-OV-3 cancer cell line after 3 h of incubation. Thus , these data demonstrated that ( WH) ₅ containing tryptophan and histidine enhanced the cellular uptake of F & rsquo;- GpYEEI and emtricitabine.
