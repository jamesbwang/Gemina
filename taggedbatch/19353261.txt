 The effect of acute noise on cognitive function has long been a topic of study , yet these effects remain a serious problem for learning performance in school children. From November 15 , 2010 to December 8 , 2010 , we enrolled 268 students from three elementary schools ( 135 boys and 133 girls , 10-12 years old) in Ulsan , Korea. The study subjects were divided into two groups according to their test conditions ( background versus additional noise) , and tests were conducted using psychological examination tools. Chi-square tests and general linear models were used to assess the differences of impacts on cognition between the two groups. After adjusting for socio-demographic covariates , the noise significantly affected the results of full-scale IQ , verbal IQ , Continuous Performance Test scores , and Children 's Color Trails Test and Stroop test scores. The groups at high risk of learning difficulties were more affected by noise than low-risk groups. These findings suggest that noise is hazardous to the attention and performance of elementary school students , particularly for groups at greater risk for poor academic achievement. Additional studies are needed to identify subject-specific levels of noise that can affect attention and cognitive function.
