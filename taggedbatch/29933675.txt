 Three aporphine-type alkaloids ( 1-3) , three lycorine-type alkaloids ( 4-6) , two crinane type alkaloids ( 7 , 8) and one phenanthridine-type alkaloid ( 9) were isolated from the chloroform soluble fraction of 70 % ethanol extract of the bulbs of Lycoris radiata through various column chromatographies over silica gel , ODS , Sephadex LH-20 and MCI. Their structures were elucidated as ( +)- N-methoxylcarbonyl-1,2-methylenedioxyl-isocorydione ( 1) , isocorydione ( 2) , 8-demethyl-dehydrocrebanine ( 3) , ( +) -3-hydroxy-anhydrolycorine N-oxide ( 4) , vasconine ( 5) , pancratinine D ( 6) , yemenine A ( 7) , 11-O-acetylhaemanthamine ( 8) , and 5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-2-hydroxyphenanthridine ( 9) based on their chemical and physicochemical properlies and spectroscopic data. Compound 1 was a new compound and alkaloids 2-9 were isolated and identified from this plant for the first time.
