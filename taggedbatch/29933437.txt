 Dolutegravir ( DTG) is a preferred drug for initial treatment of human<pathogen><disease> immunodeficiency<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> type 1 infection. We present next-generation sequencing analysis of integrase genotypes during a period of virologic failure in a treatment-naive man who initiated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine plus DTG.
