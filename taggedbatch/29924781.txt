 Presented herein is the world experience of surgical treatment and various tactical approaches in a combined lesion<symptom> of the extracranial and intracranial portions of the internal carotid artery ( ICA): a combination of its stenosis or occlusion with vascular malformation of the brain ( a cerebral aneurysm<disease> , pathological anastomoses , arteriovenous malformations). Also pointed out is the prevalence of the pathology involved , followed by describing various types of surgical policy in this condition: staged and simultaneous interventions , endovascular and standard operative auxiliary techniques. Taking into consideration a low incidence rate of combined pathology of the ICA , there are currently no randomized studies that would make it possible to work out a common tactical approach to management of this cohort of patients. Hence , this vascular and neurosurgical problem appears to require further study.
