 The article is basically an attempt to provide a consolidated report on impact assessment and trends in research pertaining to accumulation and curbing the menace of polyaromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH) accumulation in leaves. Emphasis is given to understand the consequences of the fact that edible/medicinal plants cultivated in PAH contaminated soil or close to such places which are potential liberators of PAHs can virtually act as transporters for direct PAH entry into biological systems. An attempt has been made to predict the future by digging out golden facts from history. Extensive Scopus-based data mining has been done to dig out research data since last 10 years ( 2006-2016) pertaining to the said area. Critical analysis of statistical data on research trends highlighting the different aspects of evaluation of PAH accumulation in leaves has been described. The concentrate of all researches for the said period have been presented as few golden principles which shall serve as important facts for researchers and policy makers for curbing the menace of PAH-induced oxidative stress in plants and shall also provide start-up ideas for researchers new to the area. Critical analysis of trends in phytoremediation aspect has also been duly highlighted to measure the intensity of restoration steps taken by researchers and government to safeguard the future generations.
