 Recipient travel distance may be an unrecognized burden in lung transplantation. Retrospective single-center cohort study of all adult ( ≥ 18 years) first-time lung-only transplants from January 1 , 2010 , until February 28 , 2017. Recipient distance to transplant center was calculated using the linear distance from the recipient 's home zip code to the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland , Ohio. 569 recipients met inclusion criteria. Posttransplant graft survival was 85 % , 88 % , 91 % , and 91 % at 1 year and 49 % , 52 % , 57 % , and 56 % at 5 years posttransplant for recipient travel distances of ≤ 50 , > 50 to ≤ 250 , > 250 to ≤ 500 , and > 500 miles , respectively ( P = .10). We found no significant relationship between recipient travel distance and posttransplant graft survival. In carefully selected recipients , travel distance is not a significant barrier to successful posttransplant outcomes which may be important for patient decision-making and donor allocation policy. These data should be validated in a national cohort.
