 This study aimed to examine the effects of communication training on nurses ' ability to conduct bedside handovers in hospital. Of the 26 participating nurses , 13 had recently completed specialized training in bedside handovers using the Connect , Ask , Respond , and Empathize ( CARE) and Past , Present , and Future ( PPF) of the patient journey and condition protocols for health care communication. The other 13 nurses did not participate in this training. Researchers videotaped and evaluated these nurses ' handover practices using the Bedside Handover Evaluation Form. Nurses who had received the specific training in bedside handovers interacted with their patients to a far greater extent , asked more questions , and stated more complete information about their patient 's medical journey. Nurses who participate in health care communication training on bedside handovers subsequently demonstrate a significantly better ability to lead these clinical interactions. This is evidenced by their articulation of more detailed medical information , their more respectful and multifaceted interactions with patients , and their more inclusive approach to all participants in the handover.
