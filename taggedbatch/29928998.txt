 Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis<disease><symptom> ( sJIA) is a childhood rheumatic disease of unknown origin. Dysregulated innate immunity is implicated in disease pathology. We investigated if IL-1 inhibition affects circulating cytokines and monocyte gene expression. CD14 + monocytes from patients in the RAPPORT trial were analyzed by RT-PCR for expression of IL1B and transcription factors associated with monocyte activation. Serum IL-1ra decreased with treatment , and IL-18BP transiently increased. Serum levels of IL-1Î² , IL-6 , IL-10 and IL-18 were unchanged. IRF5 and STAT6 were decreased , and PPARG was increased , independent of clinical response , and may represent a skew toward a PPARG-driven M2-like phenotype. IL1B expression was decreased in early clinical responders. A transient increase in STAT1 , and a decrease in SOCS1 preceded the reduction in IL1B in early clinical responders. Changes in IL1B/STAT1/SOCS1 could be associated with crosstalk between IL-1 and IFN pathways in sJIA. These transcriptional changes might be useful as drug response biomarkers.
