 In this chapter we present and discuss , with the aid of several representative case studies from drug discovery and computational toxicology , a new cheminformatics platform , Enalos Suite , that was developed with open source and freely available software. Enalos Suite ( http://enalossuite.novamechanics.com/) was designed and developed as a useful tool to address a variety of cheminformatics problems , given that it expedites tasks performed in predictive modeling and allows access , data mining and manipulation for multiple chemical databases ( PubChem , UniChem , etc.). Enalos Suite was carefully designed to permit its extension and adjustment to the special field of interest of each user , including , for instance , nanoinformatics , biomedical , and other applications. To demonstrate the functionalities of Enalos Suite that are useful in different cheminformatics applications , we present indicative case studies that include the exploitation of chemical databases within a drug discovery project , the calculation of molecular descriptors , and finally the development of a predictive QSAR model validated according to OECD principles. We aspire that at the end of this chapter , the reader will capture the effectiveness of different functionalities included in the Enalos Suite that could be of significant value in a multitude of cheminformatics applications.
