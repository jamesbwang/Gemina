 Hyperglycemia significantly contributes to the development and progression of metabolic diseases. Managing postprandial blood glucose fluctuations is of particular importance for patients with hyperglycemia , but safe and effective means of reducing blood glucose levels are still lacking. Five diets with varying macronutrient ratios and omega-3 fatty acid amounts were tested for their blood glucose-lowering effects in male C57BL/6J mice. The diets with potent blood glucose-lowering effects were further investigated for their underlying mechanisms and their beneficial effects on hyperglycemia models. Mice given the low-carbohydrate , high-protein , and high-omega-3 ( LCHP +3) diet exhibited a rapid reduction of the blood glucose levels that remained consistently low , regardless of feeding. These effects were associated with reduced amino acid gluconeogenesis , due to the inhibition of hepatic alanine transaminase ( ALT). Furthermore , the LCHP +3 intervention was effective in reducing the blood glucose levels in several disease conditions , including type 1 diabetes mellitus , hormone-induced hyperglycemia , and diet-induced metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom>. Our findings identify the LCHP +3 diet as a potent blood glucose-lowering diet that suppresses postprandial blood glucose fluctuations through the inhibition of gluconeogenesis and may have great clinical utility for the management of metabolic diseases with hyperglycemia.
