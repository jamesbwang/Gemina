 Present screening methods to rapidly detect release of nickel and cobalt ions from metallic surfaces involve colorimetric dimethylglyoxime ( DMG)- and disodium-1-nitroso-2-naphthol-3,6-disulfonate-based spot tests with a cotton bud. There is a risk of false-negative test reactions because test outcomes are dependent on the pressure , area , and duration of surface wiping. The aim of the study was to develop a miniaturized electrochemical device that uses a voltage to accelerate nickel and cobalt release from the tested item and perform an initial validation. A device was built in plastic , and its performance was investigated using 0.5 mL of test solutions of , respectively , DMG and disodium-1-nitroso-2-naphthol-3,6-disulfonate. Cotton buds that had been wetted in test solution were pressed against different metal surfaces at various voltages ( 0-9 V) and a range of test durations ( 0-120 seconds). Duplicate testing for nickel and cobalt release was also performed on a sample of 163 jewelry items. This novel electrochemical device makes it possible to perform nickel and cobalt ion release testing without rubbing , thereby reducing interindividual differences in testing technique. The nickel testing with the device seemed to be superior to conventional DMG spot testing.
