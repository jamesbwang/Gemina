 Intestinal barrier is crucial for animals against translocation of engineered nanomaterials ( ENMs) into secondary targeted organs. However , the molecular mechanisms for the role of intestinal barrier against ENMs toxicity are still largely unclear. The intestine of Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> is a powerful in vivo experimental system for the study on intestinal function. In this study , we investigated the molecular basis for intestinal barrier against toxicity and translocation of graphene oxide ( GO) using C. elegans<pathogen> as a model animal. Based on the genetic screen of genes required for the control of intestinal development at different aspects using intestine-specific RNA interference ( RNAi) technique , we identified four genes ( erm-1 , pkc-3 , hmp-2 and act-5) required for the function of intestinal barrier against GO toxicity. Under normal conditions , mutation of any of these genes altered the intestinal permeability. With the focus on PKC-3 , an atypical protein kinase C , we identified an intestinal signaling cascade of PKC-3-SEC-8-WTS-1 , which implies that PKC-3 might regulate intestinal permeability and GO toxicity by affecting the function of SEC-8-mediated exocyst complex and the role of WTS-1 in maintaining integrity of apical intestinal membrane. ISP-1 and SOD-3 , two proteins required for the control of oxidative stress , were also identified as downstream targets for PKC-3 , and functioned in parallel with WTS-1 in the regulation of GO toxicity. Using C. elegans<pathogen> as an in vivo assay system , we found that several developmental genes required for the control of intestinal development regulated both the intestinal permeability and the GO toxicity. With the focus on PKC-3 , we raised two intestinal signaling cascades , PKC-3-SEC-8-WTS-1 and PKC-3-ISP-1/ SOD-3. Our results will strengthen our understanding the molecular basis for developmental machinery of intestinal barrier against GO toxicity and translocation in animals.
