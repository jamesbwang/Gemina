 The tumor microenvironment ( TME) is featured with aberrant vasculatures , specific physiological parameters , viscoelastic extracellular matrix and stromal cells , which are important factors in tumor initiation , development and metastasis. The components in TME form physical/biological barriers for drug delivery and therapy , and also contribute to resistance to treatment and immunosuppression. The advances in nanobiotechnology have offered a myriad of nanoparticles for targeting and treating tumors through the passive or active targeting strategies. However , the barriers in TME always limit the drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticles. To cope with this , recent strategies have employed nanoparticles to target and remodel tumor microenvironment , while a variety of nanoparticles have been developed with different functions for this score. In this review , we have described the typical features of tumor microenvironment along with their roles in tumor progression , and then focused on recent progresses in development and application of nanoparticles to target and remodel TME for enhanced cancer therapy.
