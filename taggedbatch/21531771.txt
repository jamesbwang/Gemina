 For modelling sexually transmitted infections , duration of partnerships can strongly influence the transmission dynamics of the infection. If partnerships are monogamous , pairs of susceptible individuals are protected from becoming infected , while pairs of infected individuals delay onward transmission of the infection as long as they persist. In addition , for curable infections re-infection from an infected partner may occur. Furthermore , interventions based on contact tracing rely on the possibility of identifying and treating partners of infected individuals. To reflect these features in a mathematical model , pair formation models were introduced to mathematical epidemiology in the 1980 's. They have since been developed into a widely used tool in modelling sexually transmitted infections and the impact of interventions. Here we give a basic introduction to the concepts of pair formation models for a susceptible-infected-susceptible ( SIS) epidemic. We review some results and applications of pair formation models mainly in the context of chlamydia<pathogen> infection.
