 Testicular cancer is rare , accounting for 1-3 % of incidence of all malignancies in men. Forecasts predict that the incidence of testicular cancer will increase by 25 % in Europe by 2025. We aimed to describe temporal and spatial trends of rates of patients surgically treated for testicular cancer ( STTC) in France over the period 2000-2014. Using the International Classification of Diseases and medical procedure codes , from the national hospital discharge database , we selected patients diagnosed with testicular cancer during 2000-2014 who underwent surgery. We used the world 's standard population as a reference to standardize rates. We included 29,760 STTC patients. The mean age at diagnosis was 37.4 ( ± 13.5) years. Over the period 2000-2014 , the standardized incidence rate of STTC was 6.2 ( 95 % CI: 6.1; 6.3) per 100,000 person-years. The overall rate of STTC increased by 21.3 % between 2000 and 2014. The annual percentage change ( APC) was +1.9 % ( 95 % CI: 1.4; 2.3) over that period. The incidence rate of STTC was highest among men aged 30-44 ( 15.0 ( 95 % IC: 14.7; 15.2) per 100,000 person-years) and lowest among men aged 0-14 ( 0.2 ( 95 % IC: 0.16; 0.22)). Age-specific STTC incidence rates were similar to indicators from cancer registry data except in elderly men aged 60 years and over. Over the study period , the incidence of STTC increased over the year in all the regions of Metropolitan France. APC varied across regions from 1.0 % ( 95 % IC: -4.1; 6.1) in Île-de-France to 4.2 % ( 95 % IC: -0.8; 9.2) in Corse. Hospital discharge data , which are more quickly available than population-based data , are good complementary surveillance source for monitoring testicular cancer , especially in young adult patients and area without population-based registry.
