 Genistein is a natural isoflavone enriched in soybeans. It has beneficial effects for patients with mucopolysaccharidose type III through inhibiting glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. However , other studies indicate that genistein does not always inhibit glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms , CHOK1 , CHO3 .1 , CHO3 .3 , and HCT116 cells were treated with genistein and the monosaccharide compositions and quantity of all glycans from the cell lysate were measured after thorough acid hydrolysis followed by HPLC analysis. In addition , the glycosaminoglycan disaccharide compositions were obtained by stable isotope labeling coupled with LC/MS analysis. Genistein treatment reduced the amount of glycans but increased the amount of glycosaminoglycans in HCT116 cells. In contrast , genistein treatment reduced both glycan and glycosaminoglycan quantities in CHOK1 , CHO3 .1 , and CHO3 .3 cells in addition to differential changes in glycosaminoglycan disaccharide compositions. Genistein treatment reduced overall glycan quantity but glycosaminoglycan quantities were either increased or decreased in a cell type-dependent manner.
