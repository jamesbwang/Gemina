 Myocarditis<disease> is an illness characterized by myocardial infiltration with inflammatory cells and non-ischemic myocytic necrosis<symptom>. The clinical presentation of myocarditis<disease> varies widely and diagnosis is sometimes difficult to establish. The current incidence of myocarditis<disease> is also difficult to determine as endomyocardial biopsy , the diagnostic gold standard , is unfrequently used , or even not justified. The leading causes are infections , immune-mediated injury and toxins. Prognosis is most often good but , in some patients , the disease can be fulminant with progression to cardiogenic shock<symptom> , or occurrence of sudden cardiac death. Prognosis in myocarditis<disease> patients varies according to the underlying aetiology. Treatment is generally symptomatic , but in some cases , a specific therapy is appropriated as a function of the corresponding aetiology. This paper aims to review current knowledge concerning myocarditis<disease> , with particular emphasis on `` urgent '' situations.
