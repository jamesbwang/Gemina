 Hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> E<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HEV<pathogen>) is a major cause of acute viral hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom>. Patients with chronic hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> superinfected with HEV<pathogen> may progress to liver failure. Babao Dan ( BD) is a traditional Chinese medicine widely used as an auxiliary option for the treatment of chronic hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> and liver cancer in China. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of BD on the management of HEV<pathogen> infection in a rabbit model. Sixty-two specific-pathogen-free ( SPF) rabbits were divided randomly into five groups and treated with BD or placebo for 2 weeks. All rabbits were inoculated intravenously with rabbit HEV<pathogen> after initial administration. Then , rabbits were administered BD or ribavirin or placebo at 2 weeks post-inoculation ( wpi) until faecal virus shedding showed negative. The duration of faecal virus shedding and levels of HEV<pathogen> RNA in faeces were reduced , and anti-HEV antibodies were detected in all rabbits in groups treated with BD before or after inoculation. Ribavirin treatment rapidly cleared HEV<pathogen> infection in SPF rabbits , but anti-HEV antibodies remained negative in 50 % of rabbits treated with ribavirin. These results indicate that ribavirin treatment was more effective in clearing HEV<pathogen> infection , while administration of BD before or after inoculation was effective in clearing HEV<pathogen> infection. Further clinical studies are warranted.
