 The slpB gene of Lactobacillus<pathogen> acidophilus<pathogen> NCFM , which differs from the slpA gene and is silent under normal conditions , was successfully amplified and ligated to the corresponding available sites on a recombinant pET-28a vector. Then the pET-28a-slpB vector was transformed into Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> DH ( DE3) and the fusion His-slpB protein was expressed by induction with 1 mM IPTG for 14 h at 37 Â°C. The resulting His-slpB protein ( S
