 Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy , which could metastasize at an early stage of the disease and associated with poor prognoses. Liver , small bowel , stomach , and colon are the most common locations for metastatic visceral melanoma , however , solitary abdominal metastasis from uveal melanoma is extremely rare. The current study reports the case of a 33-year-old man with history of treated choroidal melanoma of the left eye that developed metastasis to the abdomen , preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography and computed tomography strongly suggested as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST). The patient was diagnosed with abdominal metastatic melanoma according to his medical history and histopathological results. The young adult underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. The patient finally got the definite diagnosis with his medical history and histopathological results and he has been living disease free for nearly 3 years after the surgery. Although rare , the possibility of abdominal metastatic melanoma presenting with the clinical picture of gastrointestinal stromal tumor must be always considered by the surgeon especially the patients with a history of primary malignant melanoma.
