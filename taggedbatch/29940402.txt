 The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of various trace elements in muscles with different oxidative/glycolytic profiles ( cardiac ( CA); diaphragm ( DI) , as oxidative; trapezius ( TR) , as intermediate oxidative/glycolytic; and semimembranosus ( SM) , as glycolytic muscle) of ten dairy-aptitude ( Holstein-Friesian , HF) , ten beef-aptitude ( Galician Blonde , GB) and ten cross-breed ( GBxHF) calves. The type of muscle was a highly significant factor in relation to the concentrations of all elements , whereas breed was only significant for Fe , Mn and Zn in the SM muscle. The concentrations of the main trace elements ( Cu , Fe , Se and Zn) were significantly lower in GB and GBxHF than in HF , that were mainly associated with differences in the oxidative/glycolytic profile , probably due to the muscular hypertrophy characteristic of heavily muscled breeds. The pattern of distribution was similar in all breeds , with significantly higher concentrations in the CA muscle , followed by the DI; trace element concentrations in the SM and TR muscles were very similar.
