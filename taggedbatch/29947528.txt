 Chronic kidney disease ( CKD) is a life-threatening disease arising as a frequent complication of diabetes , obesity and hypertension. Since it is typically undetected for long periods , it often progresses to end-stage renal disease. CKD is characterized by the development of progressive glomerulosclerosis , interstitial fibrosis<disease> and tubular atrophy along with a decreased glomerular filtration rate. This is associated with podocyte injury and a progressive rise in proteinuria<symptom>. As endothelin-1 ( ET-1) through the activation of endothelin receptor type A ( ET ( A)) promotes renal cell injury , inflammation<symptom> , and fibrosis<disease> which finally lead to proteinuria<symptom> , it is not surprising that ET ( A) receptors antagonists have been proven to have beneficial renoprotective effects in both experimental and clinical studies in diabetic and non-diabetic CKD. Unfortunately , fluid retention encountered in large clinical trials in diabetic CKD led to the termination of these studies. Therefore , several advances , including the synthesis of new antagonists with enhanced pharmacological activity , the use of lower doses of ET antagonists , the addition of diuretics , plus simply searching for distinct pathological states to be treated , are promising targets for future experimental studies. In support of these approaches , our group demonstrated in adult subtotally nephrectomized Ren-2 transgenic rats that the addition of a diuretic on top of renin-angiotensin and ET ( A) blockade led to a further decrease of proteinuria<symptom>. This effect was independent of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> which was normalized in all treated groups. Recent data in non-diabetic CKD , therefore , indicate a new potential for ET ( A) antagonists , at least under certain pathological conditions.
