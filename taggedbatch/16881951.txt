 Improving health literacy is increasingly seen as a solution to health problems and inequalities. This study assesses how one of the more recent measures of health literacy , the Health Literacy Skills Instrument- Short Form , performs among African American college students , and ascertains if and how media use relates to health literacy. Results indicate that both the use of health-related websites and apps as well as overall time spent with the media were positively , but conditionally , linked to health literacy. However , findings also pointed to the need for further test development.
