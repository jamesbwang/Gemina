 The pathophysiology of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) has been intensely studied but remains incompletely defined. Currently , multiple mechanisms are known to contribute to the development of SLE. These include inadequate clearance of apoptotic debris , aberrant presentation of self nucleic antigens , loss of tolerance , and inappropriate activation of T and B cells. Genetic , hormonal , and environmental influences are also known to play a role. The study of lupus in children , in whom there is presumed to be greater genetic influence , has led to new understandings that are applicable to SLE pathophysiology as a whole. In particular , characterization of inherited disorders associated with excessive type I interferon production has elucidated specific mechanisms by which interferon is induced in SLE. In this review , we discuss several monogenic forms of lupus presenting in childhood and also review recent insights gained from cytokine and autoantibody profiling of pediatric SLE.
