 Tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> ( TB) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Every year millions of people die due to TB. Drug resistance has been a major factor that has obstructed successful control and treatment of TB. As the rate of spread of drug-resistant TB outpaces the rate of discovery of new anti-tubercular drugs , targeted therapy may provide a new approach to TB cure. In a scenario where drug resistance is spreading rapidly , and existing drugs regimens seem to be dwindling away , this review summarizes the concept of host-targeted therapy which may be the ray of hope for the effective management and control of the rapidly spreading drug-resistant TB ( multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant).
