 The first biomimetic total syntheses of chromane meroterpenoids , guadials B and C , guapsidial A and psiguajadial D have been completed. The key synthetic transformation involves an efficient and high yielding hetero-Diels-Alder reaction. The two structurally isomeric natural products , guadials B and C , were obtained from a common o-quinone methide in the separate reactions with α-pinene and β-pinene , respectively. The two regioisomeric natural products , guapsidial A and psiguajadial D , were achieved in a single chemical operation.
