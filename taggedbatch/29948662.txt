 Our study was conducted to compare self-fixing lightweight polyester mesh ( group I) to the standard heavy weight polypropylene mesh ( group II) using tension-free Lichtenstein hernioplasty as regard to the effect of mesh implantation and perimesh fibrosis<disease> on testicular blood flow. 80 patients with uncomplicated inguinal hernia were divided in two groups. Doppler ultrasonography measured testicular volume , testicular artery velocity preoperative and 3rd month post operative. Blood flow in the testicles was represented by resistive index ( RI). No case of testicular atrophy occurred in either group , however , in both groups a significant postoperative decrease in testicular volume ( p = 0.001 in group I and p < 0.001 in group II) was accompanied by a significant increase in RI as compared to their pre-operative values ( p < 0.001 in group I and p = 0.009 in group II). Comparing the two groups , patients in group I showed higher values of decrease in testicular volume accompanied by more increase in RI values postoperatively compared to group II patients , but these values did not reach a significant value ( p = 0.107 , p = 0.136). There was a significant increase in the number of post-operative varicocele and hydrocele in group I compared to group II. Mesh implantation has an effect on testicular size and blood flow by decreasing the testicular size and increasing the RI. This effect was more obvious in the parietex progrip. Although there is an indirect relation between RI and the sperm count , testicular blood flow alone is not enough to judge fertility.
