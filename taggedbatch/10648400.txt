 von Willebrand disease ( VWD) type 2B is characterized by gain-of-function mutations in von Willebrand factor ( VWF) , enhancing its binding affinity for the platelet receptor glycoprotein ( GP) Ibα. VWD type 2B patients display a bleeding tendency associated with loss of high-molecular-weight VWF multimers and variable thrombocytopenia<symptom>. We recently demonstrated that a marked defect in agonist-induced activation of the small GTPase , Rap1 , and integrin αIIbβ3 in VWD ( p.V1316M) type 2B platelets also contributes to the bleeding tendency. Here , we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying impaired platelet Rap1 signaling in this disease. Two distinct pathways contribute to Rap1 activation in platelets: rapid activation mediated by the calcium-sensing guanine nucleotide exchange factor CalDAG-GEF-I ( CDGI) and sustained activation that is dependent on signaling by protein kinase C ( PKC) and the adenosine 5 '- diphosphate receptor P2Y12. To investigate which Rap1 signaling pathway is affected , we expressed VWF/p. V1316M by hydrodynamic gene transfer in wild-type and
