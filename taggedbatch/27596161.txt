 Methylmalonic acidemia ( MMA) is an autosomal recessive disease of organic acidemia. We report a 26-year-old male who presented with metabolic acidosis , acute<symptom> renal<symptom> failure<symptom> required hemodialysis and acute<pathogen><disease><symptom> respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> required mechanical ventilation support. Progressive hypotonia of muscles made weaning from mechanical ventilator difficult. High level of serum methylmalonic acid and the mut genotype sequences confirmed the diagnosis of this adult-onset MMA. Two mut genotype sequences were found by analyzing all coding exons and exon-intron junctions. One genotype was well documented ( Exon 6 Mutation , c. 1280G > A. p. G427D , heterozygous). The other mut genotype sequence had never been reported elsewhere ( Intron 6 Novel , c. 1333-13_c. 1333-8delTTTTTC , heterozygous). Diet modification , medication , regular hemodialysis and physical rehabilitation. Weaning strategy adjusted with help of electrical impedance tomography. The muscle power of the patient gradually recovered. Extubation of the patient was successful and he was discharged without oxygen required. This case gives us the lesson that MMA can be newly diagnosed in adult patient. A new mut genotype sequence was discovered. The use of electrical impedance tomography to select a suitable method for inspiratory muscle training was possible and useful.
