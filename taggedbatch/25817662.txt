 Our research objective was to develop , characterize , and optimize stable form of nano-colloidal carrier with Eudragit-coated solid lipid nanobioparticles ( SLNbp) for oral delivery of isradipine ( ISR). To achieve , a three factors , i.e. , lipid-to-surfactant ratio ( A , % w/w) , Eudragit L100 ( B , % w/w) , and sonication time ( C , minutes) at three levels ( -1 and +1 levels of quality central level) was applied to develop SLNbp using response surface methodology at constant ratio of ISR and rutin. The second-order polynomial quadratic equations of responses ( R1 , R2 , and R3; entrapment efficiency ( EE) , particle size , and drug release) were constructed and also plotted response surface ( two- and three-dimensional) plots. The derived polynomial equation and 2D and 3D model were showed the relationship between the responses of the selected independent variables ( A , B , and C). The model validation and optimization was performed by numerical checkpoint analysis to predict the optimized solid lipid nanobioparticle formulas ( ONbp 1-10). The optimized formulations prepared and during evaluation ONbp 3 has better smaller particle size ( 106 nm) , sustainable release ( 95.61 % up to 40 h) , higher EE ( 97.85 %) , and drug content ( 99.92 % Â± 0.08 %) during 3-month storage showed good stability. Therefore , its performance can be considered for further development of stable oral drug delivery system of ISR.
