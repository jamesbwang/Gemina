 The current study was to examine the association of adequate intake of macronutrients and micronutrients with traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors in hemodialysis patients.A clinical cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2013 and April 2017 on 492 hemodialysis patients aged 20 years and above , received thrice-weekly hemodialysis treatment for at least 3 months , adequate dialysis quality ( equilibrated Kt/V â‰¥ 1.2 g/kg/d) from 7 hospital-based hemodialysis centers in Taiwan. The dietary intake was evaluated by the 3-day dietary record , and a 24-hour dietary recall. Biochemical parameters were archived from laboratory tests. The cardiovascular disease ( CVD) risk factors were defined by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative ( K/DOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines. The adequate dietary intake of macronutrients and micronutrients was recommended by the European Best Practice Guidelines , K/DOQI , and Institute of Medicine guidelines. Logistic regression analysis was used.All hemodialysis patients had CVD risks , the lowest proportion of patients with adequate intake of macronutrients and micronutrients were 8.7 % and 1.8 % , respectively. The adequate dietary intake associated with lower likelihood of having CVD risks in hemodialysis patient by 47 % to 84 % , including 39 % to 58 % lower hypertension , 37 % to 50 % lower dyslipidemia , 42 % to 63 % diabetes mellitus , 44 % to 84 % lower obesity , 58 % lower low calcium , 38 % lower hyperparathyroidism , 47 % to 64 % lower hyperhomocysteinemia , and 41 % to 67 % lower inflammation<symptom> , 63 % to 74 % lower hypoalbumin , 73 % lower inadequate normalized protein nitrogen appearance.Adequate dietary nutrients intake may reduce the cardiovascular risks factors , in turn , to prevent the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
