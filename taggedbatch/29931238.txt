 Given multi-platform genome data with prior knowledge of functional gene sets , how can we extract interpretable latent relationships between patients and genes? More specifically , how can we devise a tensor factorization method which produces an interpretable gene factor matrix based on functional gene set information while maintaining the decomposition quality and speed? We propose GIFT , a Guided and Interpretable Factorization for Tensors. GIFT provides interpretable factor matrices by encoding prior knowledge as a regularization term in its objective function. We apply GIFT to the PanCan12 dataset ( TCGA multi-platform genome data) and compare the performance with P-Tucker , our baseline method without prior knowledge constraint , and Silenced-TF , our naive interpretable method. Results show that GIFT produces interpretable factorizations with high scalability and accuracy. Furthermore , we demonstrate how results of GIFT can be used to reveal significant relations between ( cancer , gene sets , genes) and validate the findings based on literature evidence.
