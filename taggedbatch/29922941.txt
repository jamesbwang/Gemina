 Levosimendan and milrinone may be used in place of dobutamine to increase cardiac output in septic patients with a low cardiac output due to impaired cardiac function. The effects of the two inotropic agents on cardiac inflammation<symptom> and left ventricular ( LV) performance were examined in mice with cecal ligation and puncture ( CLP)- induced sepsis<disease>. CLP mice displayed significant cardiac inflammation<symptom> , as indicated by highly increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration in myocardial tissues. When continuously given , levosimendan prevented but milrinone exaggerated cardiac inflammation<symptom> , but they significantly reduced the elevations in plasma cardiac troponin-I and heart-type fatty acid-binding protein , clinical markers of cardiac injury. Echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function showed that the effect of levosimendan , given by an intravenous bolus injection , on LV performance was impaired in CLP mice , whereas milrinone produced inotropic responses equally in sham-operated and CLP mice. A lesser effect of levosimendan on LV performance after CLP was also found in spontaneously beating Langendorff-perfused hearts. In ventricular myocytes isolated from control and CLP mice , levosimendan , but not milrinone , caused a large increase in the L-type calcium current. This study represents that levosimendan and milrinone have cardioprotective properties but provide different advantages and drawbacks to cardiac inflammation/dysfunction in sepsis<disease>.
