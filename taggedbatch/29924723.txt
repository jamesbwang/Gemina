 We propose that in the microenvironment of inflammatory tissues , including tumours , extracellular proteinases can modulate cell signalling in part by regulating proteinaseactivated receptors ( PARs). We have been exploring this mechanism in a variety of inflammation<symptom> and tumour-related settings that include tumour-derived cultured cells from prostate and bladder cancer , as well as immune inflammatory cells that are involved in the pathology of inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> including multiple sclerosis. Our work shows that proteinase signalling via the PARs affects prostate and bladder cancer-derived tumour cell behaviour and can regulate calcium signalling in human T-cell and macrophage-related inflammatory cells as well as in murine splenocytes. Further , we find that the tumour-derived prostate cancer cells and immune-related cells ( Jurkat , THP1 , mouse splenocytes) can produce PAR-regulating proteinases ( including kallikreins: KLKs) , that can control tissue function by both a paracrine and autocrine mechanism. We suggest that this PAR-driven signalling process involving secreted microenvironment proteinases can play a key role in cancer and inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> including multiple sclerosis.
