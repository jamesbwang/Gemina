 Reaction time ( RT) is the time interval between the appearance of a stimulus and initiation of a motor<symptom> response<symptom>. Within RT , two processes occur , selection of motor goals and motor planning. An unresolved question is whether perturbation to the motor planning component of RT slows the response and alters the voluntary activation of muscle. The purpose of this study was to determine how the modulation of muscle activity during a RT response changes<symptom> with motor plan perturbation. Twenty-four young adults ( 20.5 Â± 1.1 years , 13 women) performed 15 trials of an isometric RT task with ankle dorsiflexion using a sinusoidal anticipatory strategy ( 10-20 % MVC). We compared the processing part of the RT and modulation of muscle activity from 10-60 Hz of the tibialis anterior ( primary agonist) when the stimulus appeared at the trough or at the peak of the sinusoidal task. We found that RT ( P = 0.003) was longer when the stimulus occurred at the peak compared with the trough. During the time of the reaction , the EMG power from 10-35 Hz was less at the peak than the trough ( P = 0.019) , whereas the EMG power from 35-60 Hz was similar between the peak and trough ( P = 0.92). These results suggest that perturbation to motor planning lengthens the processing part of RT and alters the voluntary activation of the muscle by decreasing the relative amount of power from 10-35 Hz.
