 Due to maturation of the postural control system and secular declines in motor performance , adolescents experience deficits in postural control during standing and walking while concurrently performing cognitive interference tasks. Thus , adequately designed balance<symptom> training programs may help to counteract these deficits. While the general effectiveness of youth balance<symptom> training is well-documented , there is hardly any information available on the specific effects of single-task ( ST) versus dual-task ( DT) balance<symptom> training. Therefore , the objectives of this study were ( i) to examine static/dynamic balance<symptom> performance under ST and DT conditions in adolescents and ( ii) to study the effects of ST versus DT balance<symptom> training on static/dynamic balance<symptom> under ST and DT conditions in adolescents. Twenty-eight healthy girls and boys aged 12-13 years were randomly assigned to either 8 weeks of ST or DT balance<symptom> training. Before and after training , postural sway and spatio-temporal gait parameters were registered under ST ( standing/walking only) and DT conditions ( standing/walking while concurrently performing an arithmetic task). At baseline , significantly slower gait speed (
