 The impact factor is a frequently applied tool in research output analytics. Based on five consecutive publication years each of five pharmacology journals , we have analyzed to which extent review articles yield more impact factor-relevant citations than original articles. Our analysis shows that review articles are quoted about twice as often as original articles published in the same year in the same journal. We conclude that inclusion of review articles does not substantially affect the impact factor of a journal unless they account for considerably more than 10 % of all published articles.
