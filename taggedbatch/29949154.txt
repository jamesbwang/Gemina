 Up-regulation of miR-765 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC) has been reported in the previous study. The aim of the present study was to measure the levels of miR-765 expression in ESCC and evaluate its clinical significance in ESCC patients. Quantitative Real-time PCR assays were performed to analyze the expression of miR-765 in human ESCC tissues and adjacent esophageal tissues. The relationships between miR-765 expression levels and the clinical factors were investigated by x2-test. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to evaluate the overall survival ( OS) and disease-free survival ( DFS) of ESCC patients with a different expression level of miR-765. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the independent prognostic factors. The expression level of miR-765 in ESCC tissues was significantly higher than that in their corresponding normal tissues ( p < 0.01). High miR-765 expression was significantly correlated with tumor stage ( p = 0.001) , lymph nodes metastasis ( p = 0.005) , clinical stage ( p = 0.007). In addition , Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with higher miR-765 expression had a significantly poorer OS ( p = 0.0010) and DFS ( p < 0.0001) than those with lower miR-765 expression. Multivariate analyses revealed that miR-765 expression served as an independent predictor for both OS ( p = 0.001) and DFS ( p = 0.001). Our findings provided the first evidence that miR-765 may serve as an indicator for prognosis of ESCC.
