 In patients with pancreatitis<disease> , early persisting organ<symptom> failure<symptom> is believed to be the most important cause of mortality. This study investigates the relation between the timing ( onset and duration) of organ<symptom> failure<symptom> and mortality and its association with infected pancreatic necrosis<symptom> in patients with necrotising pancreatitis<disease>. We performed a post hoc analysis of a prospective database of 639 patients with necrotising pancreatitis<disease> from 21 hospitals. We evaluated the onset , duration and type of organ<symptom> failure<symptom> ( ie , respiratory , cardiovascular and renal<symptom> failure<symptom>) and its association with mortality and infected pancreatic necrosis<symptom>. In total , 240 of 639 ( 38 %) patients with necrotising pancreatitis<disease> developed organ<symptom> failure<symptom>. Persistent organ<symptom> failure<symptom> ( ie , any type or combination) started in the first week in 51 % of patients with 42 % mortality , in 13 % during the second week with 46 % mortality and in 36 % after the second week with 29 % mortality. Mortality in patients with persistent multiple<symptom> organ<symptom> failure<symptom> lasting < 1 week , 1-2 weeks , 2-3 weeks or longer than 3 weeks was 43 % , 38 % , 46 % and 52 % , respectively ( p = 0.68). Mortality was higher in patients with organ<symptom> failure<symptom> alone than in patients with organ<symptom> failure<symptom> and infected pancreatic necrosis<symptom> ( 44 % vs 29 % , p = 0.04). However , when excluding patients with very early mortality ( within 10 days of admission) , patients with organ<symptom> failure<symptom> with or without infected pancreatic necrosis<symptom> had similar mortality rates ( 28 % vs 34 % , p = 0.33). In patients with necrotising pancreatitis<disease> , early persistent organ<symptom> failure<symptom> is not associated with increased mortality when compared with persistent organ<symptom> failure<symptom> which develops further on during the disease course. Furthermore , no association was found between the duration of organ<symptom> failure<symptom> and mortality.
