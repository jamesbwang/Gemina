 A high prevalence of sleep problems exists in children and adolescents with life-limiting conditions ( LLC) and severe psychomotor impairment ( SPMI). This study aimed to compare the impacts of various child-related ( pain , epilepsy , repositioning , medical care) and environment-related ( light , noise , TV/radio , open door) factors on sleep in this vulnerable population. Data were obtained through the & ldquo; Sleep Questionnaire for Children with Severe Psychomotor Impairment & rdquo; ( SNAKE) by proxy assessment.
