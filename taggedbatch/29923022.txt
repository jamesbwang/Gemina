 Although slice thickness accuracy is important for the performance of magnetic resonance imaging systems , long scan times are required to perform reliable measurements. Inclined slabs and wedges are conventionally used as test devices to obtain slice profiles. In this study , a novel dedicated device with a widened slab was created , and its efficacy was compared with that of a conventional wedge. The signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR) of the profile and the coefficient of variation ( CV) of the measured slice thickness were measured. Wide slab usage showed sufficient SNR by averaging multiple profile lines , even with single acquisition. Therefore , it is possible to substantially shorten the measurement time. When â‰¥ 20 lines were averaged , CV was < 1 %. Furthermore , a 200-mm slab width enabled evaluation of the positional dependence of slice thickness in a single imaging. Thus , quality control of MRI slice thickness can be easily implemented with this device.
