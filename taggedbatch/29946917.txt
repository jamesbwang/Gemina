 To describe critical care medicine residents ' training , expertise , and skills regarding organ and tissue donation processes and procedures. We undertook a qualitative multicentre study and employed a purposive sample of program directors , physicians , nurses , residents , and organ donation leaders from all nine academic intensive care unit ( ICU) training centres ( five adult<disease> , four pediatric) in Ontario ( n = 71). Interviews , conducted by telephone between December 2015 and March 2016 , were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data collection and analysis were performed using an iterative process and continued until saturation was achieved. Five main themes were identified: 1) gaps in residents ' knowledge for both neurologic determination of death ( NDD) and circulatory determination of death ( DCD) cases; 2) commitment to the provision of organ and tissue donation training; 3) limited experiential learning ( NDD and DCD); 4) challenges related to the provision of training on organ donation and need for a standardized curriculum; and 5) communication with family members. Overall , this study showed system-level gaps in training resulting from the lack of a standardized provincial curriculum on organ donation. Qualitative data corroborated that residents need more exposure to clinical cases , especially regarding DCD donors. A standardized education curriculum would be beneficial for all residents within the ICU. Developing a better shared understanding of the donation process will improve team communication and performance , translate into a better end-of-life experience for families , and potentially result in increased donation rates.
