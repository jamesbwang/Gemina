 The aim of this study was to explore the role of oxidative stress index ( OSI) , myeloperoxidase ( MPO) , and catalase ( CAT) activity in cardiac allograft vasculopathy ( CAV) in heart transplant recipients ( HTRs). The study enrolled a median age of 41 ± 9 years 47 recipients. The HTx patients were divided into two groups based on the presence CAV as follows: CAV The mean total antioxidant capacity ( 0.79 ± 0.46 vs 1.03 ± 0.33 μmol H An increase in the serum level of OSI , MPO , and CAT was associated with CAV in HTRs.
