 Asymmetric total synthesis of naturally occurring γ-butenolide containing ( 4.4) spiro-tetrahydrofuran lanceolactone A has been reported in the present work. Bimetallic ( `` Pd-Cu '') cascade cyclization was the crucial reaction employed for the construction of the γ-butenolide framework of the natural product. Subsequently , iodocyclization and reductive deiodination through a transfer hydrogenation reaction were applied to access the target molecule in an efficient manner.
