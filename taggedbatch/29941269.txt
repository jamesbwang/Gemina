 The effects of C/N ratio of a nitrate-containing wastewater on nitrate removal performed by autohydrogenotrophic bacteria as well as on the morphological parameters of floc such as floc morphology , floc number distribution , mean particle size ( MPS) , aspect ratio and transparency were examined in this study. The results showed that the nitrate reduction rate increased with increasing C/N ratio from 0.5 to 10 and that the nitrogen removal of up to 95 % was found at the C/N ratios of higher than 5 ( between 0.5-10). Besides , high C/N ratio values reflected a corresponding high nitrite accumulation after 12-hr operation , and a fast decreasing rate of nitrite in the rest of operational time. The final pH values increased with the C/N ratio increasing from 0.5 to 2.5 , but decreased with the C/N ratio increasing from 2.5 to 10. There were no significant changes in floc morphology with the MPSs ranging from 35 to 40Î¼m. Small and medium-sized flocs were dominant in the sludge suspension , and the number of flocs increased with the increasing C/N ratios. Furthermore , the highest apparent frequency of 10 % was observed at aspect ratios of 0.5 and 0.6 , while the transparency of flocs changed from 0.1 to 0.7.
