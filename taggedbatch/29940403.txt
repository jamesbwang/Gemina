 The study aimed to improve the quality characteristics of Turkish dry-fermented sausages ( sucuk) using different concentrations of chitosan ( CH) coating as superficial mold inhibitor. The sausages were treated ( w/w) with chitosan ( 0.2 % , CH1; 0.5 % , CH2 and 1 % , CH3) , potassium sorbate ( 20 % , PS) , acetic acid ( 1 % , AA) and distilled water. Treatment with PS and CH3 resulted in a remarkable reduction of mold and yeast counts in the sausages and on casings at the end of ripening. Total aerobic mesophilic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria ( LAB) varied from 7.19-7.29 to 9.01-9.27 and from 6.37-6.44 to 8.53-8.93 log CFU/g at day 0 and 12 , respectively. Treatment with chitosan did not affect the natural microbiota of the sausages. Enterobacteriaceae counts were lowered from 5.79-5.89 to 2.08-2.53 log CFU/g by chitosan. Moreover , the rate of lipid oxidation in the sausages decreased by chitosan treatment. Sensory attributes were also notably enhanced in the cooked sausages treated with chitosan.
