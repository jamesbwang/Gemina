 The first spectrofluorimetric report investigating the fluorimetric behavior of the antihistaminic drug , azelastine ( AZEL) , and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , nepafenac ( NEP) , either in bulk or in their dosage forms , eye drops and ophthalmic suspension. After a full investigation of the factors that may influence their spectrofluorimetric behavior: pH , different organized media and organic solvents , the optimum factors were set in order to enable the analysis of each drug with maximum sensitivity. The AZEL spectrofluorimetric analysis was set at 286/364 ( Î»
