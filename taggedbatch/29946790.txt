 Somatic embryogenesis ( SE) involves complex molecular signalling pathways. Understanding molecular mechanism of SE in Larix leptolepis ( L. leptolepis) can aid research on genetic improvement of gymnosperms. Previously , we obtained five LaMIR166a ( miR166a precursor)- overexpression embryonic cell lines in the gymnosperm Larix leptolepis. The proliferation rates of pro-embryogenic masses in transgenic and wild-type lines were calculated. Overexpression of the miR166a precursor LaMIR166a led to slower proliferation. When pro-embryogenic masses were transferred to maturation medium , the relative expression of LaMIR166a and miR166a in the LaMIR166a-overexpression lines was higher than in the wild-type during SE , while LaHDZ31-34 expression levels also increased without negative control by miR166 , suggesting that regulation of HD-ZIP III by miR166a exits stage-specific characteristics. The key indole-3-acetic acid ( IAA) biosynthetic gene Nitrilase of L. leptolepis ( LaNIT) was identified and the effects of miR166a on auxin biosynthesis and signalling genes were studied. During SE , LaNIT , Auxin response factor1 ( LaARF1) and LaARF2 mRNA levels and IAA contents were markedly higher in LaMIR166a-overexpression lines , which revealed lower deformity rate of embryos , indicating endogenous IAA synthesis is required for somatic embryo maturation in L. leptolepis. Additionally , the IAA biosynthesis and signalling genes showed similar expression patterns to LaHDZ31-34 , suggesting HD-ZIP III genes have a positive regulatory effect on LaNIT. Our results suggest miR166a and LaHDZ31-34 have important roles in auxin biosynthesis and signalling during SE , which might determine if the somatic embryo normally developed to mature in L. leptolepis.
