 The aim of this study is to identify the risks factors for mortality and functional recovery in elderly patients admitted to hospital with a hip fracture. Longitudinal prospective study in patients 80 years old or more and patients between 75 and 79 in residential home care with a hip fracture and with a past medical history of dementia or followed-up by the Geriatric Unit. A total of 359 patients were included , and the demographic data , previous functional status , comorbidity , type of fracture , and dementia were recorded. The data collected during admission included time to surgery , delirium<symptom> , functional recovery , length of stay , placement at discharge , and mortality. Patients were followed-up for one year and details were collected on placement at the end of follow-up , functional recovery , medical complications , and mortality. The baseline characteristics of the patients with a strong association with mortality after a hip fracture were old age ( > 92 years) , medical complications delaying surgery ( HR 2.17; 95 % CI; 1.27-3.73) , diagnosis of dementia ( HR 1.78; 95 % CI; 1.15-2.75) , or heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HR 1.75; 95 % CI; 1.12-2.75). The fitted multivariable regression models showed that functional impairment before the hip fracture or lack of functional recovery are associated with higher mortality , and patients with increased age , delirium<symptom> , dementia , and previous functional impairment showed worse functional recovery. In the elderly patients with a hip fracture , increased age , comorbidity and previous functional status is associated with mortality. Functional recovery prognosis will depend on age , previous functional status , past medical history of dementia , and the presence of delirium<symptom> during admission.
