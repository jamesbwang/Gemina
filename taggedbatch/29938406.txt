 Optical coherence tomography ( OCT) can provide high-speed and high-resolution images of the anatomical structures of the optic nerve head and macula. However , in neuro-ophthalmic conditions that present acutely , structural changes lag functional deficits , and the role of OCT in the acute setting has been challenged. This review aims to summarize the recent literature and evidence supporting the use of OCT in the acute management of some common neuro-ophthalmic scenarios , including the differential diagnosis of optic disc swelling , and in patients with suspected papilledema , optic neuritis , ischemic optic neuropathies , and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. The limitations of OCT are also discussed.
