 The aim of this study is to assess the impact of objective ( stretched) and subjective penile size in the erectile function in a urological check-up program on a cross-sectional study including 689 men aged 35-70 years. IIEF-5 questionnaire , physical examination ( penile length , prostate volume , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , body mass index-BMI) , metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> ( MS) , comorbidities , habits ( sexual intercourse frequency , physical activity , alcohol , and tobacco use) , level of education , serum glucose , total testosterone , estradiol , PSA , lipid profile , and self-perceptions ( ejaculation time and subjective penile size) were examined in multivariate models using logistic and linear regressions. Penile objective mean length was 13.08 cm Â± 2.32 and 67 ( 9.72 %) patients referred small penis self-perception. Seventy-six ( 11.03 %) participants had severe erectile dysfunction ( ED) , 75 ( 10.88 %) had mild to moderate and moderate ED , 112 ( 16.25 %) had mild ED and 426 ( 61.83 %) had no ED. Risk factors for ED that held statistical significance were self-perceived small penis ( OR = 2.23 , 95 % CI 1.35-3.69 , p = .0017) , sexual intercourse frequency ( per week) ( OR = 0.45 , 95 % CI 0.38-0.52 , p < .0001) , satisfactory ejaculation time ( no vs. yes , OR = 2.06 , 95 % CI 1.46-2.92 , p < .0001) , comorbidity ( yes vs. no , OR = 2.01 , 95 % CI 1.46-2.76 , p < .0001) , age > 65 years ( OR = 2.93 , 95 % CI 1.53-5.61 , p < .0001) , tobacco use ( yes vs. no , OR = 1.41 , 95 % CI 1.02-1.96 , p < .0375) , regular physical activity ( no vs. yes , OR = 1.59 , 95 % CI 1.13-2.23 , p < .0083) , serum total testosterone < 200 ng/dl ( OR = 3.48 , 95 % CI 1.69-7.16 , p = 0.0009) , serum glucose > 100 mg/dl ( OR = 1.69 , 95 % CI 1.18-2.43 , p = 0.0044) and systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> > 130 mmHg ( OR = 1.60 , 95 % CI 1.16-2.19 , p = 0.0037). Results suggest that in addition to previously reported risk factors , patient 's subjective impressions of penile size negatively impacts sexual life in about 10 % of men considered healthy , while objective penile length does not play significant role in erectile function.
