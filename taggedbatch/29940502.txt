 Insufficient tumor penetration is one of the major obstacles for satisfactory cancer therapy. As a result , the ability to push the lower limits of size for nanoparticle platforms that have traditionally existed in larger forms is highly desirable. In our study , a facile solvent diffusion method was applied to prepare an ultra-small nanostructured lipid carrier ( usNLC) which was capable of encapsulating hydrophobic molecules. Our results demonstrate that the as-prepared usNLC is composed of homogeneous particles with size around 25 nm. In addition to its preferable colloidal stability , negligible hemolysis<symptom> as well as strong tumor homing property , the as-prepared usNLC shows preferable tumor penetration capacity both in vitro and in vivo. The paclitaxel ( PTX) loaded usNLC shows comparable in vitro cytotoxicity on HepG2 cells and multicellular tumor spheroids to Taxol with the best in vivo anti-tumor efficacy , which all indicate its potential to be a promising candidate for cancer therapy.
