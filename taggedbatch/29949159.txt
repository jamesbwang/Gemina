 Ferroptosis is a new-found iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic regulated cell death ( RCD) , which is activated on therapy with several antitumor agents , but the potential mechanism remains unclear. Erastin , exhibiting selectivity for RAS-mutated cancer cells , induces ferroptosis by increasing iron and lipid reactive oxygen species ( ROS) levels in cell. Ferroportin ( Fpn) , the sole iron export protein , participates in the regulation of intracellular iron concentration. In this study , we investigated the role of Fpn on ferroptosis induced by erastin in SH-SY5Y cells. The cell viability was determined by CellTiter 96 ® AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay kit. The activity of caspase-3 was measured by ELISA kit. qRT-PCR was performed to examine the mRNA expression of Fpn. Western blot assay was conducted to examine the expression level of marker proteins. Specific commercial kits were used to examine the levels of MDA , ROS and iron in cells , respectively. Ferroptosis was evaluated by intracellular lipid ROS level and iron concentration. Hepcidin could prevent erastin-induced ferroptosis by degrading Fpn. Erastin ( 5 μg/mL) was observed to induce ferroptosis in neuroblastoma cells at 6 hours , which was promoted by knockdown of Fpn. The expression of Fpn gene and protein was decreased in SH-SY5Y cells treated with erastin. After treatment with erastin , Fpn siRNA transfection in SH-SY5Y cells was able to accelerate ferroptosis-associated phenotypic changes. Fpn acted as a negative regulator of ferroptosis by reducing intracellular iron concentration. Knockdown of Fpn enhanced anticancer activity of erastin. These results suggested that knockdown of Fpn accelerated erastin-induced ferroptosis by increasing iron-dependent lipid ROS accumulation , highlighting Fpn as a potential therapeutic target site for neuroblastoma. Thus , Fpn inhibitors may provide new access for chemosensitization of neuroblastoma.
