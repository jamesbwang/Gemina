 Isolated rupture of the flexor hallucis longus tendon is an unusual injury. We present the case of a neglected flexor hallucis longus tendon closed traumatic rupture at the plantar aspect of the first phalangeal head of the great toe in a middle-age male. The injury occurred while he was dancing. Because end-to-end tendon suture was impossible , the ensuing gap was repaired using a free plantaris tendon graft. We present the operative repair benefit of the flexor hallucis longus tendon rupture to regain the function and strength of the interphalangeal joint of the hallux , avoid extension of the distal phalanx , and maintain the longitudinal arch of the foot.
