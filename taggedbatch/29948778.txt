 This study investigated the effect of different levels of corn supplementation as energy source into palm kernel cake-urea-treated rice straw basal diet on urinary excretion of purine derivatives , nitrogen utilization , rumen fermentation , and rumen microorganism populations. Twenty-seven Dorper lambs were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and kept in individual pens for a 120-day period. The animals were subjected to the dietary treatments as follows: T1: 75.3 % PKC + 0 % corn , T2: 70.3 % PKC + 5 % corn , and T3: 65.3 % PKC + 10 % corn. Hypoxanthine and uric acid excretion level were recorded similarly in lambs supplemented with corn. The microbial N yield and butyrate level was higher in corn-supplemented group , but fecal N excretion , T3 has the lowest level than other groups. Lambs fed T3 had a greater rumen protozoa population while the number of R.<pathogen> flavefaciens<pathogen> was recorded highest in T2. No significant differences were observed for total bacteria , F. succinogenes , R. albus<pathogen> , and methanogen population among all treatment. Based on these results , T3 could be fed to lambs without deleterious effect on the VFA and N balance<symptom>.
