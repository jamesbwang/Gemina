 Accurate detection of protein biomarkers in complex media remains a challenge due to severe nonspecific adsorption and biofouling , and sensing interfaces that combine the high sensitivity and antifouling ability are highly desirable. Herein , an antifouling sensing interface capable of sensitively assaying immunoglobulin E ( IgE) in biological samples was constructed. The sensing interface was fabricated through the self-assembly of a zwitterionic peptide and the IgE aptamer onto a macroporous Au substrate , which was electrochemically fabricated with the aid of multilayer polystyrene nanospheres self-assembled on glassy carbon electrode. Due to the huge surface area arising from porous morphology and high specificity of aptamer , the developed electrochemical biosensor exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity and selectivity towards IgE , with the linear range of 0.1-10 pg mL
