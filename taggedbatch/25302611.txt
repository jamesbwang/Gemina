 The present study aimed to investigate the cervical lymph node metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC) and to establish a novel N staging standard for NPC , based on intensity modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT) via a prospective multicenter clinical trial. Between January 2006 and December 2009 , a total of 492 patients with NPC without distant metastasis were included in the present study. All patients were treated with IMRT. According to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group division standards , the present study proposed a novel N staging system following the review of magnetic resonance images in comparison with the 7th edition of Union for International Cancer Control/American Joint Committee on Cancer ( UICC/AJCC) staging system. Retropharyngeal lymph nodes , cervical lymph node level and cervical lymph node laterality were independent prognostic factors used in multivariate analyses. According to the results of the risk variety , the present study suggested that the novel N staging system included: N0 ( no lymph node metastasis) , N1 ( retropharyngeal or/and unilateral upper cervical ( I , II , III , Va , VIIb , VIII , IX and X regions) lymph node metastasis) , N2 ( bilateral upper cervical ( I , II , III , Va , VIIb , VIII , IX and X regions) lymph node metastasis) and N3 ( lymph node metastasis in IVa and Vb regions and their lower regions). The novel N staging system proposed in the present study performs better in risk difference and distribution balance<symptom>. Furthermore , the differences of 5-year curves of distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival had greater statistically significant differences compared with the 7th edition of the UICC/AJCC staging system. The present study suggested a novel N staging system for cervical lymph node metastasis of NPC , which may predict the prognosis of patients with NPC in a more objective and accurate way.
