 Fatigue<symptom> is a major consequence of subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( SAH) , but the specific characteristics are unclear. Our objective was to investigate the nature of post-SAH fatigue<symptom> ( mental or physical) and to determine the relationship with functional outcome in the chronic stage. Also , the possible influence of mood disorders and acute SAH-related factors ( SAH type and external cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) drainage) on the presence of fatigue<symptom> was investigated. Patients with an aneurysmal SAH ( aSAH) or angiographically negative SAH ( anSAH) were assessed 3-10 years post-SAH ( N = 221). Questionnaires were used to investigate mental and physical fatigue<symptom> and mood. Functional outcome was examined with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended. Between-group comparisons and binary logistic regression analysis were performed. Frequencies of mental and physical fatigue<symptom> were 48.4 % and 38.5 % , respectively , with prevalence of mental<symptom> fatigue<symptom> being significantly higher. A two-way anova with SAH type and external CSF drainage as independent variables and mental<symptom> fatigue<symptom> as dependent variable showed a significant main effect of CSF drainage only ( P < 0.001). Only mental<symptom> fatigue<symptom> explained a significant part of the variance in long-term functional outcome ( model Ï‡ Mental<symptom> fatigue<symptom> after SAH is a serious burden to the patient and is associated with impaired long-term functional outcome. Distinguishing different aspects of fatigue<symptom> is relevant as mental post-SAH fatigue<symptom> might be a target for treatment aimed to improve long-term outcome.
