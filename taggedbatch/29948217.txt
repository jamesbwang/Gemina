 Iron ( Fe) deficiency anemia<symptom> in young children is a global health concern which can be reduced by Fe fortification of foods. Cereal is often one of the first foods given to infants , providing adequate quantities of Fe during weaning. In this work , we have compared iron bioavailability and iron status of four iron sources used to fortify infant cereals , employing piglets as an animal model. The study was conducted on 36 piglets , 30 of them with induced anemia<symptom>. From day 28 of life , the weaned piglets were fed with four experimental diets ( n = 6) each fortified with 120 mg Fe/kg by ferrous sulfate heptahydrate ( FSH) , electrolytic iron ( EI) , ferrous fumarate ( FF) , or micronized dispersible ferric pyrophosphate ( MDFP) for another 21 days. In addition , one group of six anemic piglets fed with the basal diet with no iron added ( Control-) and a Control + group of non-anemic piglets ( n = 6) were also studied. Blood indicators of iron status were measured after depletion and during the repletion period. The Fe content in organs , hemoglobin regeneration efficiency , and relative bioavailability ( RBV) was also determined. The Fe salts adequately treated anemia<symptom> in the piglets , allowing the animals to recover from the anemic state , although EI was less efficient with regard to replenishing Fe stores giving lower concentrations of plasma ferritin and iron in the spleen , liver , lung , and kidney. In addition , the RBV of EI was 88.27 % with respect to the reference iron salt ( FSH). Ferrous fumarate and MDFP were equally as bioavailable as the reference salt , and were used significantly better than EI in piglets. These results contribute to extend the evidence-based results for recommending the most suitable fortificant for infant cereals.
