 mRNA decay is an important strategy by which bacteria can rapidly adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The 5 '- terminus state of mRNA determines the velocity of decay of many types of RNA. In Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , RNA pyrophosphohydrolase ( RppH) is responsible for the removal of the 5 '- terminal triphosphate from hundreds of mRNAs and triggers its rapid degradation by ribonucleases. A diaminopimelate epimerase , DapF , can directly interact with RppH and stimulate its hydrolysis activity in vivo and in vitro. However , the molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here , we determined the complex structure of DapF-RppH as a heterotetramer in a 2:2 molar ratio. DapF-bound RppH exhibits an RNA-favorable conformation similar to the RNA-bound state , suggesting that association with DapF promotes and stabilizes RppH in a conformation that facilitates substrate RNA binding and thus stimulates the activity of RppH. To our knowledge , this is the first published structure of an RNA-pyrophosphohydrolysis complex in bacteria. Our study provides a framework for further investigation of the potential regulators involved in the RNA-pyrophosphohydrolysis process in prokaryotes.
