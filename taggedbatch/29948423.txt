 We performed a comparative survival analysis of patients undergoing robotic-assisted versus laparoscopic or open surgery for upper tract urothelial carcinoma ( UTUC). Patients diagnosed with non-metastatic UTUC undergoing removal of the kidney and/or ureter were identified using Medicare-linked Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results Program data ( 2004-2013). Patients aged 65-85 years were categorized based on surgical approach ( open , laparoscopic , or robotic-assisted). Kaplan-Meier methods were used to determine survival ( overall and cancer-specific) and intravesical recurrence rates , the former using a propensity score-weighted model. Independent predictors of survival were determined using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. We identified a total of 3801 patients meeting the final inclusion criteria: open ( n = 1862) , laparoscopic ( n = 1624) , and robotic ( n = 315). Robotic surgery was associated with the shortest length of hospital stay ( p < 0.001) but highest in-hospital charges ( p < 0.001) , with no difference in readmission rates ( p = 0.964). No difference was found in overall or cancer-specific survival in the robotic cohort when compared with open or laparoscopic surgery. In addition , no difference in the rate of intravesical recurrence was noted in robotic-assisted laparoscopy compared with the other groups. The sole predictor of improved survival was extent of lymphadenectomy , which was highest in the robotic cohort. Using a large , population-based cancer database , there was no survival difference when a robotic-assisted approach was utilized in patients undergoing surgery for UTUC. These findings are important with the increased use of robotic surgery in the management of UTUC.
