 The mammalian gastrointestinal tract harbors a highly diverse and dynamic community of bacteria. The array of this gut bacterial community , which functions collectively as a fully unified organ in the host metabolism , varies greatly among different host species and can be shaped by long-term nutritional interventions. Non-human primates , our close phylogenetic relatives and ancestors , provide an excellent model for studying diet-microbiome interaction; however , compared to clinical and rodent studies , research targeting primate gut microbiome has been limited. Herein , we analyze the gut microbiome composition in female cynomolgus macaques (
