 The efficacy of auditing is still a subject of debate and concerns exist whether auditing promotes risk averse behaviour of physicians. This study evaluates the achievements made in colorectal cancer surgery since the start of a national clinical audit and assesses potential signs of risk averse behaviour. Data were extracted from the Dutch ColoRectal Audit ( 2009-2016). Trends in outcomes were evaluated by uni and multivariable analyses. Patients were stratified according to operative risks and changes in outcomes were expressed as absolute ( ARR) and relative risk reduction ( RRR). To assess signs of risk averse behaviour , trends in stoma construction in rectal cancer were analysed. Postoperative mortality decreased from 3.4 % to 1.8 % in colon cancer and from 2.3 % to 1 % in rectal cancer. Surgical and non-surgical complications increased , but with less reintervention. For colon cancer , the high-risk elderly patients had the largest ARR for complicated postoperative course ( 6.4 %) and mortality ( 5.9 %). The proportion of patients receiving a diverting stoma or end colostomy after a ( L) AR decreased 11 % and 7 % , respectively. In low<symptom> rectal cancer , patients increasingly received a non-diverted primary anastomosis ( 5.4 % in 2011 and 14.4 % in 2016). No signs of risk averse behaviour was found since the start of the audit. Especially the high-risk elderly patients seem to have benefitted from improvements made in colon cancer treatment in the past 8 years. For rectal cancer , trends towards the construction of more primary anastomoses are seen. Future quality improvement measures should focus on reducing surgical and non-surgical complications.
