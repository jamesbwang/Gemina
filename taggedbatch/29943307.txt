 Bone morphogenic protein-4 ( BMP-4) is a proinflammatory cytokine which is controlled by BMP-4 antagonists. Our aim was to investigate the levels of BMP-4 and its antagonists , noggin and matrix Gla protein ( MGP) , in prediabetes and diabetes. One hundred and forty-two type 2 diabetic , 32 prediabetic , and 58 control subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. BMP-4 , noggin , and MGP were measured with the ELISA method. There was a significant difference between the three groups in relation to sex , hypertension , fasting plasma glucose , HbA1c , lipid profiles , and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( p < 0.05). BMP-4 levels were significantly lower in the diabetic group compared to the control group ( 108.5 and 127.5 ng/mL , respectively , p < 0.001 diabetes vs. control). Noggin levels were significantly lower in the diabetic group compared to the prediabetic and control groups ( 10.5 , 11.5 , and 12.0 ng/mL , as median , respectively , p < 0.001; diabetes vs. control , p = 0.002; diabetes vs. prediabetes). BMP-4 was associated significantly with noggin in the entire study population ( ÃŸ coefficient = 0.796 , p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve was 0.708 ( 95 % CI 0.551-0.864 , p = 0.011) for BMP-4 levels. The optimal cutoff value of BMP-4 for detecting albuminuria was 118.5 ng/mL for which sensitivity was 71.4 % and specificity was 66.4 %. BMP-4 and noggin levels were lower in the diabetic group. High BMP-4 levels were significantly associated with albuminuria. Further studies are warranted to determine the role of BMP-4 in the pathogenic processes underlying albuminuria and hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.
