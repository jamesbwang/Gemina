 Several models for educational simulation of labor and delivery were published in the literature and incorporated into a commercially available training simulator ( CAE Healthcare Lucina). However , the engine of this simulator does not include a model for the clinically relevant indicators: uterine contraction amplitude and frequency , and cervical dilation. In this paper , such a model is presented for the primigravida in normal labor. The conceptual and mathematical models represent oxytocin release by the hypothalamus , oxytocin pharmacokinetics , and oxytocin effect on uterine contractions , cervical dilation , and ( positive) feedback from cervical dilation to oxytocin release by the hypothalamus. Simulation results for cervical dilation are presented , together with target data for a normal primigravida. Corresponding oxytocin concentrations and amplitude and frequency of uterine contractions are also presented. An original empirical model for educational simulation of oxytocin concentration , uterine contractions , and cervical dilation in first-stage labor is presented. Simulation results for cervical dilation match target data for a normal patient. The model forms a basis for taking into account more independent variables and patient profiles and can thereby considerably expand the range of training scenarios that can be simulated.
