 The existing literature on the use of dermatomal somatosensory evoked potentials in lumbosacral spinal canal stenosis is limited. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of dermatomal against mixed tibial somatosensory evoked potential ( SEP) as a complementary procedure to imaging studies in the diagnosis of lumbosacral stenosis. Thirty patients with clinically and radiologically diagnosed lumbosacral stenosis and 20 normal individuals were enrolled in the study. The study was ethically approved , and informed consent for participation was provided. All participants underwent bilateral mixed tibial and dermatomal SEP study of the third ( L3) , fourth ( L4) , fifth lumbar ( L5) , and first sacral ( S1) dermatomes. N45 , N25 , N20 , and N10 tibial SEP waves were measured from four channels , whereas dermatomal waves were measured from cortical recording. Peak latency and amplitude of each wave were calculated. The cutoff value of the dermatomal S1 latency showed the highest sensitivity and specificity percentages ( 81.7 and 82.5 , respectively) , followed by L5 and N25. N25-N45 interpeak latency showed the lowest sensitivity and specificity. All L5 , S1 , L4 , and N25 latency cutoff values presented highly significant differences between affected sides and controls ( P < 0.0001) , followed by N45 and N20. The amplitude cutoff values of SEP waves showed equivocal sensitivity and specificity percentages. Somatosensory evoked potential studies can be used as a supplementary test for the diagnosis of lumbosacral stenosis , with the dermatomal studies being more valuable expressing multiple root abnormalities. S1 dermatomal wave latency has the highest diagnostic value , followed by L5 , N25 , and then L4 latencies.
