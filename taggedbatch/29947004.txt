 Pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ ( PLCIS) is an uncommon high-grade in situ lesion<symptom> that shares morphologic features of both classic lobular and ductal carcinoma in situ. Data on the natural history of pure PLCIS are limited , and no evidence-based consensus guidelines for management exist. From our prospectively maintained institutional pathology and breast surgery databases , we identified all patients with a diagnosis of PLCIS on core needle biopsy ( CNB) or excisional biopsy from 2004 to 2017. Patient , tumor , treatment , and outcome data were abstracted to analyze upstage rates and treatment outcomes. We identified 18 patients with pure PLCIS: 15 diagnosed on CNB , 2 diagnosed at operation for atypia on CNB , and 1 diagnosed after excisional biopsy without preceding CNB. Of the 15 patients with PLCIS on CNB , 3 ( 20 %) were upgraded to invasive cancer on surgical excision. Overall , 7 patients were treated with mastectomy ( all margin-negative) and 11 with lumpectomy ( one with a focally positive margin). Eight patients received adjuvant therapy: six endocrine therapy , one radiation therapy , and one received both. Among patients with a final diagnosis of PLCIS , two ipsilateral recurrences were observed at follow-up: one invasive lobular carcinoma at 87 months and one PLCIS at 16 months postoperatively. PLCIS on CNB mandates surgical resection as 20 % of patients may be upgraded to invasive cancer , and outcomes following pathologic margin-negative surgical resection were excellent with only one invasive recurrence observed. Larger-scale investigation with longer follow-up is needed to define a role for adjuvant therapy and to develop evidence-based treatment guidelines.
