 A series of novel liquid crystals with various lanthanide ions ( Eu ( III) , Sm ( III) and Tb ( III)) was designed and prepared starting from corresponding lanthanide nitrates and N-alkylated 4-pyridones derivatives with mesogenic 3,4,5-tris ( alkyloxy) benzyl moieties ( alkyl = hexyl , octyl , decyl , dodecyl , tetradecyl or hexadecyl). These new lanthanidomesogens were investigated for their mesogenic properties by a combination of differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC) , polarizing optical microscopy ( POM) and temperature dependent powder X-ray diffraction ( XRD). Additionally , their thermal stability was assessed by thermogravimetric analysis ( TG). All these complexes display an enantiotropic liquid crystalline behavior with either a lamellar ( SmA) , in the case of shorter chains analogues ( 6 and 8 carbon atoms) or a hexagonal columnar ( Colh) phase , for complexes with higher number of carbon atoms ( 12 , 14 and 16) , assigned on the basis of their characteristic texture and XRD studies. For complexes with an intermediate number of carbon atoms in the side chains ( 10) , both a lamellar phase at lower temperatures and a Colh phase at higher temperatures were evidenced. In solid state , all these complexes show characteristic emissions assigned to the corresponding lanthanide ion. In addition , the luminescence decay curves showed single exponential decays with the characteristic times in the ms range ( 0.75-0.90 ms for Eu ( III) , 0.045-0.060 ms for Sm ( III) and 0.75-1.05 ms for Tb ( III) , respectively).
