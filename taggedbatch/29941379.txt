 Effectively measuring progress in delivering HIV<pathogen> pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP) requires subnational estimates of the number of adults with indications for its use that account for differences in HIV<pathogen> infection rates by transmission risk ( risk) group and race/ethnicity. We applied a multiplier method with 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance data on proportions of HIV<pathogen> diagnoses by race/ethnicity and risk group and population-based estimates of risk group sizes to derive estimated numbers of adults with indications by risk group ( men who have sex with men ( MSM) , heterosexually active adults ( HET) , and persons who inject drugs ( PWID)) by race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction. An estimated 1.1 million adults had indications for PrEP use in 2015: 813,970 MSM , 258,080 HET , and 72,510 persons who inject drugs , and 500,340 blacks , 282,260 Latinos , and 303,230 whites. Among HET , 176,670 females and 81,410 males had indications. The proportions of adults with indications in each risk and race/ethnicity group varied by jurisdiction. Blacks comprised the highest number of adults with indications showing that increasing PrEP use in this population must be the highest priority. MSM remain a priority because of the high number with indications. These estimates can be used as denominators to assess PrEP coverage and impact on HIV<pathogen> incidence at subnational levels.
