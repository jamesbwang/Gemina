 A Baker cyst<symptom> is the most common mass around the knee joint. It is mostly asymptomatic; however , it may cause knee pain or focal swelling because of compression of vein or nerve. Herein , we report a case of Baker cyst<symptom> obstructing arterial flow and causing intermittent claudication. An attached polycystic mass was found posterior to the popliteal artery. Needle aspiration was ineffective , and the patient experienced recurrent lower leg<symptom> pain<symptom>. Surgical resection was performed , and the patient became symptom free. Baker cyst<symptom> may cause lower limb ischemia through obstruction of arterial flow , requiring surgical intervention.
