 Paired-agent kinetic modeling protocols provide one means of estimating cancer cell-surface receptors with in vivo molecular imaging. The protocols employ the coadministration of a control imaging agent with one or more targeted imaging agent to account for the nonspecific uptake and retention of the targeted agent. These methods require the targeted and control agent data be converted to equivalent units of concentration , typically requiring specialized equipment and calibration , and/or complex algorithms that raise the barrier to adoption. This work evaluates a kinetic model capable of correcting for targeted and control agent signal differences. This approach was compared with an existing simplified paired-agent model ( SPAM) , and modified SPAM that accounts for signal differences by early time point normalization of targeted and control signals ( SPAMPN). The scaling factor model ( SPAMSF) outperformed both SPAM and SPAMPN in terms of accuracy and precision when the scale differences between targeted and imaging agent signals ( α) were not equal to 1 , and it matched the performance of SPAM for α = 1. This model could have wide-reaching implications for quantitative cancer receptor imaging using any imaging modalities , or combinations of imaging modalities , capable of concurrent detection of at least two distinct imaging agents ( e.g. , SPECT , optical , and PET/MR).
