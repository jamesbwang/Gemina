 We have synthesised twelve manganese ( iii) dinuclear complexes , 1-12 , in order to understand the origin of magnetic exchange ( J) between the metal centres and the magnetic anisotropy ( D) of each metal ion using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. All twelve complexes contain the same bridging ligand environment of one μ-oxo and two μ-carboxylato , that helped us to probe how the structural parameters , such as bond distance , bond angle and especially Jahn-Teller dihedral angle affect the magnetic behaviour. Among the twelve complexes , we found ferromagnetic coupling for five and antiferromagnetic coupling for seven. DFT computed the J and ab initio methods computed the D parameter , and are in general agreement with the experimentally determined values. The dihedral angle between the two Jahn-Teller axes of the constituent MnIII ions are found to play a key role in determining the sign of the magnetic coupling. Magneto-structural correlations are developed by varying the Mn-O distance and the Mn-O-Mn angle to understand how the magnetic coupling changes upon these structural changes. Among the developed correlations , the Mn-O distance is found to be the most sensitive parameter that switches the sign of the magnetic coupling from negative to positive. The single-ion zero-field splitting of the MnIII centres is found to be negative for complexes 1-11 and positive for complex 12. However , the zero-field splitting of the S = 4 state for the ferromagnetic coupled dimers is found to be positive , revealing a significant contribution from the exchange anisotropy- a parameter which has long been ignored as being too small to be effective.
