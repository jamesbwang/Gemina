 Genomewide association study ( GWAS) is an efficient tool for the detection of SNPs and candidate genes in quantitative traits. Growth rate is an important trait for increasing the meat production in sheep. A total of 96 Baluchi sheep were genotyped using Illumina Ovine SNP50 BeadChip to run a GWAS for an average daily gain ( ADG) and Kleiber ratio ( KR) traits in different periods of age in sheep. Traits included were average daily gain from birth to three months ( ADG
