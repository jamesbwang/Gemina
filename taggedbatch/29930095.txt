 The C1-2 intrathecal puncture is routinely performed when lumbar puncture is not feasible. Usage has steadily decreased in part because of the perceived high risk of injury to the cervical cord. Up to this point , vague fluoroscopic guidelines have been used , creating uncertainty about the actual needle location relative to the spinal<disease> cord. We present a novel osseous landmark to aid in C1-2 intrathecal puncture , corresponding to the posterior spinal<disease> cord margin on lateral fluoroscopic views. This landmark , which we have termed the `` flare point , '' represents the triangular `` flaring '' of the posterior C1 arch at its junction with the anterior arch. Cervical spine CT myelograms were reviewed. High-resolution axial images were reformatted into the sagittal plane , and maximum-intensity-projection images were created to simulate a lateral fluoroscopic view. Tangential lines were drawn along the superior cortices of the anterior and posterior C1 arches , with the point of intersection used to approximate the flare point. Chart review was performed for all C1-2 punctures using the flare point technique in the past 3 years. Forty-two cervical myelograms were reviewed. The average flare point was 0.2 Â± 0.5 mm posterior to the dorsal spinal<disease> cord margin. In 37/42 subjects , the flare point was localized posterior to the spinal<disease> cord. Targeting by means of the flare point was used in 16 C1-2 punctures without complications. The C1 posterior arch flare point accurately approximates the dorsal spinal<disease> cord margin on myelography. Targeting between the flare point and the spinolaminar line , at the mid-C1-2 interspace , allows safe and optimal needle positioning.
