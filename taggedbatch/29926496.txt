 The objective of this review is to identify case definitions and clinical criteria of peri-implant healthy tissues , peri-implant mucositis , and peri-implantitis. The case definitions were constructed based on a review of the evidence applicable for diagnostic considerations. In summary , the diagnostic definition of peri-implant health is based on the following criteria: 1) absence of peri-implant signs of soft<disease> tissue inflammation<symptom> ( redness , swelling , profuse bleeding on probing) , and 2) the absence of further additional bone loss following initial healing. The diagnostic definition of peri-implant mucositis is based on following criteria: 1) presence of peri-implant signs of inflammation<symptom> ( redness , swelling , line or drop of bleeding within 30 seconds following probing) , combined with 2) no additional bone loss following initial healing. The clinical definition of peri-implantitis is based on following criteria: 1) presence of peri-implant signs of inflammation<symptom> , 2) radiographic evidence of bone loss following initial healing , and 3) increasing probing depth as compared to probing depth values collected after placement of the prosthetic reconstruction. In the absence of previous radiographs , radiographic bone level ≥ 3 mm in combination with BOP and probing depths ≥ 6 mm is indicative of peri-implantitis.
