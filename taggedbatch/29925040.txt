 The discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs) has solidified the concept of transcription factors as major players in controlling cell identity and provided a tractable tool to study how somatic cell identity can be dismantled and pluripotency established. A number of landmark studies have established hallmarks and roadmaps of iPSC formation by describing relative kinetics of transcriptional , protein and epigenetic changes , including alterations in DNA methylation and histone modifications. Recently , technological advancements such as single-cell analyses , high-resolution genome-wide chromatin assays and more efficient reprogramming systems have been used to challenge and refine our understanding of the reprogramming process. Here , we will outline novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying iPSC formation , focusing on how the core reprogramming factors OCT4 , KLF4 , SOX2 and MYC ( OKSM) drive changes in gene expression , chromatin state and 3D genome topology. In addition , we will discuss unexpected consequences of reprogramming factor expression in in vitro and in vivo systems that may point towards new applications of iPSC technology.
