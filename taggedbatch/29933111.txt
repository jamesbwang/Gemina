 Nile<pathogen><disease> tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus) is a pivotal economic fish that has been plagued by Streptococcus<pathogen> agalactiae<pathogen> infections for many years. Tumor necrosis<symptom> factor receptor-associated factor 6 ( TRAF6) is a crucial adaptor molecule of the interleukin-1 receptor/Toll-like receptor ( IL-1/ TLR) superfamily , which can trigger downstream signaling cascades involved in innate immunity. In this study , the full-length cDNA of TRAF6 was cloned from O. niloticus ( named On-TRAF6) , which has an open reading frame of 1716 bp , and encode a polypeptide of 571 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of On-TRAF6 contained the characteristic motifs of TRAF proteins , including a Zinc finger of RING-type , two Zinc fingers of TRAF-type , and a MATH ( meprin and TRAF homology) domain. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that On-TRAF6 shares a relatively high level of identity with those of other fishes ( 64-98 %). In healthy tilapia , mRNA expression of On-TRAF6 could be detected in all the examined tissues and the highest expression occurred in the spleen. Moreover , we found that On-TRAF6 was involved immune response of Nile tilapia following the stimulation with Streptococcus<pathogen> agalactiae<pathogen> and polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid ( Poly I: C) when determined by using qPCR. The result of subcellular localization showed that On-TRAF6 distributed in the cytoplasm , and over-expression of On-TRAF6 could strongly activated NF-ÐºB pathway in HEK293T cells. These findings indicated that On-TRAF6 may play an important role in the immune response to intracellular bacteria in Nile tilapia.
