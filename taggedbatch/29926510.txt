 Novel 17-nuclear Zr-/ Hf- oxide clusters ( ( Zr17) and ( Hf17)) are isolated from aqueous systems. In the clusters , Zr/Hf ions are connected via μ3-O , μ3-OH and μ2-OH linkages into a pinwheel core which is wrapped with SO42- , HCOO- and aqua ligands. Octahedral hexanuclear Zr-/ Hf- oxide clusters ( ( Zr6) oct and ( Hf6) oct) are also isolated from the same hydrothermal system by decreasing the synthesis temperature. Structural analysis , synthetic conditions , vibrational spectra and ionic conductivity of the clusters are studied. Structural studies and synthesis inspection suggest that formation of ( Zr6) oct and ( Zr17) involves assembly of the same transferable building blocks , but the condensation degree and thermodynamic stability of the products increase with hydrothermal temperature. The role of ( Zr6) oct and ( Zr17) in the formation of ZrO2 nanocrystals are then discussed in the scenario of nonclassical nucleation theory. Besides , the Zr-oxide clusters exhibit ionic conductivity due to the mobility of protons. This study not only adds new members to the Zr-/ Hf- oxide cluster family , but also establishes a connection from Zr4 + ions to ZrO2 in the hydrothermal preparation of zirconium oxide nanomaterials.
