 Human and filovirus host interactions remain poorly understood in areas where Ebola<disease> hemorrhagic<pathogen><disease><symptom> fever<disease><symptom> outbreaks are likely to occur. In the Bwindi region of Uganda , a hot spot of mammalian biodiversity in Africa , human livelihoods are intimately connected with wildlife , creating potential for exposure to filoviruses. We tested samples from 331 febrile patients presenting to healthcare facilities near Bwindi Impenetrable Forest , Uganda , by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) analysis and Western blot , using recombinant glycoprotein antigens for Ebola<disease> virus ( EBOV<pathogen>) , Sudan virus ( SUDV) , Bundibugyo<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( BDBV) , and Marburg<pathogen><disease> virus. Behavioral data on contact with wildlife were collected to examine risk factors for filovirus seropositivity. All patients were negative for active filovirus infection , by PCR analysis. However , patients were seroreactive to SUDV ( 4.7 %) , EBOV<pathogen> ( 5.3 %) , and BDBV ( 8.9 %) , indicating previous exposure. Touching duikers was the most significant risk factor associated with EBOV<pathogen> seropositivity , while hunting primates and touching and/or eating cane rats were significant risk factors for SUDV seropositivity. People in southwestern Uganda have suspected previous exposure to filoviruses , particularly those with a history of wildlife contact. Circulation of filoviruses in wild animals and subsequent spillover into humans could be more common than previously reported.
