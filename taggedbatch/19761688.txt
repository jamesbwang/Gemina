 Multiple operative treatments are available for the fixation of intertrochanteric femoral fractures. This analysis was conducted to provide guidance on the appropriate clinical choice to accommodate individual patients. A systematic review was performed to identify relevant articles in databases. Randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) of adults with intertrochanteric femoral fractures were eligible if they compared 2 or more of the following interventions: proximal femoral nail anti-rotation ( PFNA) , percutaneous compression plate ( PCCP) use , dynamic hip screw ( DHS) fixation , gamma nail ( GN) fixation , and artificial femoral head replacement ( FHR). Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to simultaneously compare all treatment methods. In total , 24 active-comparator studies involving 3097 participants were identified. Across all populations , greater reductions in blood<symptom> loss<symptom> and operation time were observed for PFNA than for other treatments. In terms of bleeding , more blood<symptom> loss<symptom> was observed for DHS use than for the PFNA ( SMD , 1.96; 95 % CI , 1.01-1.96) , PCCP ( SMD , 1.26; 95 % CI , 0.31-2.20) , and GN ( SMD , 0.26; 95 % CI ,- 0.35-0.87) techniques. However , a more beneficial effect was observed for DHS use than for FHR ( SMD ,- 0.23; 95 % CI ,- 1.26-0.81). DHS use resulted in a significantly longer duration of operation time than the PFNA ( SMD , 0.75; 95 % CI ,- 0.02-0.75) , PCCP ( SMD , 0.61; 95 % CI ,- 0.20-1.44) , and GN ( SMD , 0.25; 95 % CI ,- 0.26-0.77) techniques. Similarly , greater reductions in operation time were observed for DHS use than for FHR ( SMD ,- 0.12; 95 % CI ,- 1.15-0.91). The findings provide supporting evidence demonstrating the superiority of PFNA over other treatments for intertrochanteric femoral fracture. PFNA treatment results in the lowest amount of blood<symptom> loss<symptom> and the shortest operation time. These findings add to the existing knowledge of intertrochanteric femoral fracture treatment options.
