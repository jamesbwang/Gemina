 The pathogenesis of glaucoma involves numerous intracellular mechanisms including the purinergic system contribution. Furthermore , the presence and release of nucleotides and dinucleotides during the glaucomatous damage and the maintenance of degradation machinery through ecto-nucleotidase activity are participating in the modulation of the suitable extracellular complex balance<symptom>. The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of diadenosine tetraphosphate ( Ap
