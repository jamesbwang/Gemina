 Hyperphosphatemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease ( CKD) and is associated with cardiovascular disease ( CVD) , which has contributed to an increase in mortality of CKD patients. The onset of CVD often varies by time-of-day. Acute myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia occurs most frequently during early morning. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) and heart rate circadian rhythms account for the diurnal variations in CVD. Preservation of normal circadian time structure from the cardiomyocyte level to the whole organ system is essential for cardiovascular health and CVD prevention. Independent risk factors , such as reduced heart rate variability ( HRV) and increased BP variability ( BPV) , are particularly prevalent in patients with CKD. Analysis of HRV is an important clinical tool for characterizing cardiac autonomic status , and reduced HRV has prognostic significance for various types of CVD. Circadian BP rhythms are classified as extreme dipper , dipper , non-dipper or riser. It has been reported that nocturnal riser BP pattern contributes to cardiovascular threats. Previous studies have indicated that the circadian rhythm of serum phosphate in CKD patients is consistent with the general population , with the highest diurnal value observed in the early morning hours , followed by a progressive decrease to the lowest value of the day , which occurs around 11:00 am. Rhythm abnormalities have become the main therapeutic target for treating CVD in CKD patients. It has been reported that high levels of serum phosphate are associated with reduced HRV and increased BPV in CKD patients. However , the mechanisms related to interactions between hyperphosphatemia , HRV and BPV have not been fully elucidated. This review focuses on the evidence and discusses the potential mechanisms related to the effects of hyperphosphatemia on HRV and BPV.
