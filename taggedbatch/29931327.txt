 The genome of Streptomyces<pathogen> coelicolor encodes hundreds of putative regulatory proteins , most of which are of unknown function , including SCO5351. In this study , we determined that deletion of sco5351 largely abrogates production of actinorhodin ( ACT) and reduces production of the calcium-dependent antibiotic ( CDA). Comprehensive transcriptional analyses indicated that transcription of genes of the ACT pathway , including the pathway-specific regulator actII-orf4 and those involved in building of the chemical compound , was markedly lower in Δsco5351 at the late growth phase. However , transcription of genes in the CDA cluster was notably reduced in Δsco5351 only at the early growth phase , suggesting that SCO5351 has a regulatory role throughout growth. Similar to the observations with Δsco5351 , ACT production was blocked by mutagenesis of three conserved amino acids potentially involved in dimerization of SCO5351 , indicating that protein dimerization is critical for the function of SCO5351. In addition , disruption of sco5351 delayed the formation of aerial mycelium and spores under the conditions tested , and consistent with this , transcription of developmental genes associated with spore formation was reduced in Δsco5351 , implying that SCO5351 is involved in developmental control. Our findings reveal SCO5351 as a pleiotropic regulator with roles in both secondary metabolism and morphological development in S. coelicolor.
