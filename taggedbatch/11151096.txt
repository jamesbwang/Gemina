 Introduction Resident financial health has been linked to wellness and resiliency , yet financial literacy among residents is highly variable. While some medical school curricula include budgeting and student loan education , content on managing finances as a resident is usually lacking. We sought to quantitatively assess residents ' financial circumstances , needs , and interests to inform the design of a resident personal finance curriculum. Methods Surveys were sent to residents in eight specialties at an academic medical center. Likert-type responses allowed respondents to rate their level of comfort ( 1 = Very Uncomfortable , 7 = Very Comfortable) and interest ( 1 = Very Uninterested , 7 = Very Interested) in various personal finance topics including budgeting , loan repayment , disability insurance , life insurance , home buying , and retirement planning. Details regarding financial circumstances , including assets , liabilities , and insurance , were also collected. Results of questions that utilized a Likert-type scale are reported as median ( interquartile range). Results Of 346 residents surveyed , 144 ( 41.6 %) responded. Residents were from Internal Medicine ( 56 , 38.9 %) , Pediatrics ( 34 , 23.6 %) , Emergency Medicine ( 18 , 12.5 %) , and other specialties ( 36 , 25.0 %). Ninety-one ( 63.2 %) reported educational loans , with an average balance<symptom> of $ 191,730. Credit card balances<symptom> exceeding $ 3,000 were reported by 11 ( 7.6 %) respondents. One-hundred-two ( 70.1 %) reported emergency savings , but only 65 ( 45.1 %) reported having a retirement account ( average balance<symptom> $ 27,608). Respondents rated highest comfort levels with budgeting ( 5 ( 4-6)) , and lowest level of comfort with disability insurance ( 2 ( 2-4)) and home buying ( 2 ( 2-5)). Interest in learning each topic was high ( 6 ( 5-7)) , with retirement planning ( 6 ( 5-7)) , investing ( 6 ( 5-7)) , and home buying ( 6 ( 5-7)) the topics of highest interest. Conclusion These results highlight the deficits in personal finance literacy among residents. Future work should focus on development of a nationally scalable personal finance curriculum for residents.
