 Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH) is a serious form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) for which there is no marketed treatments. NAFLD is initiated by excess intake of nutrients and recent evidence has pinpointed the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier ( MPC) as a mediator of the nutritional overload signals. Areas covered: An overview is given of MSDC-0602K , a new agent in development that modulates the MPC and as such treats the symptoms of fatty liver including dysfunctional lipid metabolism , inflammation<symptom> , and insulin resistance as well as the key liver pathology including fibrosis<disease>. The current evaluation is written from the direct experience of the authors and review of published literature using standard search techniques. Expert Opinion: The mechanism of action of MSDC-0602K appears to be suited for treatment of the NASH pathophysiology. An ongoing phase 2b dose-ranging trial should demonstrate whether or not MSDC-0602K has the potential to be a cornerstone metabolic therapy for the treatment of NASH.
