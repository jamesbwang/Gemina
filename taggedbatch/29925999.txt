 Lipoprotein ( a) , or Lp ( a) , is a low-density lipoprotein-like particle largely independent of known risk factors for , and predictive of , cardiovascular disease ( CVD). We investigated the association between baseline Lp ( a) levels and the progression of coronary artery calcification ( CAC) in patients with hypercholesterolemia undergoing statin therapy. This study was a sub-analysis of a multicenter prospective study that evaluated the annual progression of CAC under intensive and standard pitavastatin treatment with or without eicosapentaenoic acid in patients with an Agatston score of 1 to 999 , and hypercholesterolemia treated with statins. We classified the patients into 3 groups according to CAC progression. A total of 147 patients ( mean age , 67 years; men , 54 %) were analyzed. The proportion of patients with Lp ( a) > 30 mg/dL significantly increased as CAC progressed ( non-progression; 5.4 % , 0 < CAC progression â‰¦ 100; 7.7 % , and CAC progression > 100; 23.6 %). Logistic regression analysis showed that Lp ( a) > 30 mg/dL was an independent predictor of the annual change in Agatston score > 100 ( OR: 5.51; 95 % CI: 1.28-23.68; p = 0.02) , even after adjusting for age , sex , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , current smoking , body mass index , and lipid-lowering medications. Baseline Lp ( a) > 30 mg/dL was a predictor of CAC progression in this population of patients with hypercholesterolemia undergoing statin therapy.
