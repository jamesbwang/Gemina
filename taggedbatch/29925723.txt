 Congenital heart disease ( CHD) is the most common birth defect , affecting 1 in 100 babies. Among CHDs , single ventricle ( SV) physiologies , such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome<disease><symptom> and tricuspid atresia , are particularly severe conditions that require multiple palliative surgeries , including the Fontan procedure. Although the management strategies for SV patients have markedly improved , the prevalence of ventricular dysfunction continues to increase over time , especially after the Fontan procedure. At present , the final treatment for SV patients who develop heart<symptom> failure<symptom> is heart transplantation; however , transplantation is difficult to achieve because of severe donor shortages. Recently , various regenerative therapies for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> have been developed that increase cardiomyocytes and restore cardiac function , with promising results in adults. The clinical application of various forms of regenerative medicine for CHD patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> is highly anticipated , and the latest research in this field is reviewed here. In addition , regenerative therapy is important for children with CHD because of their natural growth. The ideal pediatric cardiovascular device would have the potential to adapt to a child 's growth. Therefore , if a device that increases in size in accordance with the patient 's growth could be developed using regenerative medicine , it would be highly beneficial. This review provides an overview of the available regenerative technologies for CHD patients.
