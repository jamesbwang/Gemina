 Congestion<symptom> in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF) is relevant and closely linked to the clinical course. Bedside blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> measurement during the Valsalva maneuver ( Val) added to clinical examination may improve the assessment of congestion<symptom> when compared to NT-proBNP levels and left atrial pressure ( LAP) estimation by Doppler echocardiography , as surrogate markers of congestion<symptom> in HFrEF. A clinical examination , LAP and blood tests were performed in 69 HFrEF ambulatory patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40 % and sinus rhythm. Framingham Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom> Score ( HFS) was used to evaluate clinical congestion<symptom>; Val was classified as normal or abnormal , NT-proBNP was classified as low ( < 1000 pg/ml) or high ( ≥ 1000 pg/ml) and the ratio between Doppler early mitral inflow and tissue diastolic velocity was used to estimate LAP and was classified as low ( E/e ' < 15) or high ( E/e ' ≥ 15). A total of 69 patients with HFrEF were included; 27 had a HFS ≥ 2 and 13 of them had high NT-proBNP. HFS ≥ 2 had a 62 % sensitivity , 70 % specificity and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.08 ( p = 0.01) to detect congestion<symptom>. When Val was added to clinical examination , the presence of a HFS ≥ 2 and abnormal Val showed a 100 % sensitivity , 64 % specificity and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.8 ( p = 0.0004). Compared with LAP , the presence of HFS = 2 and abnormal Val had 86 % sensitivity , 54 % specificity and a positive likelihood ratio of 1.86 ( p = 0.03). In conclusion , an integrated clinical examination with the addition Valsalva maneuver may improve the assessment of congestion<symptom> in patients with HFrEF.
