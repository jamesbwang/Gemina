 Surface water and sediment samples were collected from Ajay River basin to appraise the behavior of heavy metals with surrounding environments and their inter-elemental relationships. Parameters like pH and organic carbon are having a minimal role in heavy metal distribution while some elements like Fe and Cu showed great affinity for organic matter based on linear regression analysis ( LRA). Ficklin diagram justified that river basin is not contaminated through acidic pollutants. The river basin is highly enriched with Cu , Cd , Pb , and Ni which were much higher than world average values , average shale standard , effect range low ( ERL) , and threshold effect level ( TEL). PCA and LRA verified that Cu , Cd , Pb , and Ni were mainly derived from anthropogenic inputs , and others like Fe , Mn , Zn , and Co came from geogenic sources. Pollution indices revealed that river basin is moderately to highly contaminated by Cu , Cd , and Ni. Furthermore , Ajay River basin is under strong potential ecological risk based on the obtained value of risk index and probable effect level/effect range median quotient index. However , river basin is strongly influenced by lithological properties , diversified hydrogeological settings , mineralization and mobilization of subsurface materials , and urban and industrial effluents which are controlling the heavy metals.
