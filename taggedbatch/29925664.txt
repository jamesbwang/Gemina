 Since 2013 , influenza<pathogen><disease> A/H7N9 has emerged as the commonest avian influenza<pathogen><disease> subtype causing human<disease> infection<disease> , and is associated with a high fatality risk. However , the characteristics of immune memory in patients who have recovered from H7N9 infection are not well understood. We assembled a cohort of forty-five H7N9 survivors followed for up to 15 months after infection. Humoral and cellular immune responses were analyzed in sequential samples obtained at 1.5-4 months , 6-8 months and 12-15 months post-infection. H7N9-specific antibody concentrations declined over time , and protective antibodies persisted longer in severely ill patients admitted to ICU and patients presenting with ARDS than that in patients with mild disease. Frequencies of virus-specific IFN-γ secreting T cells were lower in critically ill patients requiring ventilation than those in patients without ventilation within four months after infection. The percentages of H7N9-specific IFN-γ secreting T cells tended to increase over time in patients ≥ 60 years or critically ill patients requiring ventilation. Elevated levels of antigen-specific CD8
