 The interactions between nutrition and metabolism and skeletal muscle have long been known. Muscle is the major metabolic organ-- it consumes more calories than other organs-- and therefore , there is a clear need to discuss these interactions and provide some direction for future research areas regarding muscle pathologies. In addition , new experiments and manuscripts continually reveal additional highly intricate , reciprocal interactions between metabolism and muscle. These reciprocal interactions include exercise , age , sex , diet , and pathologies including atrophy , hypoxia , obesity , diabetes , and muscle myopathies. Central to this review are the metabolic changes that occur in the skeletal muscle cells of muscular dystrophy patients and mouse models. Many of these metabolic changes are pathogenic ( inappropriate body mass changes , mitochondrial dysfunction , reduced adenosine triphosphate ( ATP) levels , and increased Ca
