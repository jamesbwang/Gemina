 Von Hippel-Landau ( VHL) disease is characterized by malignant and benign tumors in multiple<symptom> organs. Sunitinib , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , has been clinically available for treating sporadic patients with recurrent or unresectable and metastatic clear renal cell carcinomas ( cRCCs) and metastatic lesions<symptom> of the lung , but its effect on VHL disease-associated tumors remains poorly understood. This retrospective case series examined the effect of sunitinib on RCC , hemangioblastomas , pheochromocytomas , and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in patients with confirmed VHL. Of note , three patients with VHL disease who were treated with sunitinib were identified from a review of their medical records. The efficacy of sunitinib was evaluated by comparing computed tomography ( CT) or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) scans conducted before and after treatment. Adverse side effects associated with sunitinib were assessed and recorded. All three patients with VHL disease exhibited clinical improvement after treatment with sunitinib. Patient 1 exhibited a decrease in the size of both their pheochromocytoma and RCC after 19 months of sunitinib treatment. RCCs in Patients 2 and 3 exhibited stable response to sunitinib for approximately 1 and 6 years , respectively. All the patients reported tolerable side effects. Therefore sunitinib treatment was associated with either partial response or stable control of VHL-related RCCs , pheochromocytomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( NET) with acceptable side effects. Further evaluation of sunitinib in patients with VHL disease in larger prospective studies is warranted.
