 Venous thromboembolic events ( VTE) , with their life-threatening manifestation as pulmonary embolism , are potential adverse effects of intravenous methylprednisolone ( IVMP) pulse therapy , partially due to a hypercoagulable state. The aim of the study was to analyze the influence of IVMP on selected hemostatic parameters in patients with moderate-to-severe Graves ' orbitopathy ( GO). 26 euthyroid patients with GO were treated with 12 pulses of IVMP ( 6 × 0.5 , 6 × 0.25 g every week). Hemostatic variables ( factor ( F) II , FV , FVII , FVIII , fibrinogen , antithrombin , activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT) , prothrombin time , international normalized ratio of prothrombin time , platelets and D-dimer) were analysed before , 24 and 48 h after 1st , 6th and 12th pulse. A constant , transient trend in changes of some hemostatic variables was observed after all assessed pulses. We discovered an increase in median activity of FVIII 24 and 48 h after pulses , with a shortening of aPTT 24 h after each IVMP pulse ( p < 0.00005). FVII decreased 24 h after each pulse ( p < 0.0005 after 1st and 12th , p < 0.00005 after 6th). Fibrinogen level decreased 48 h after each pulse ( P < 0.00005). We did not observe any statistically significant changes in hemostatic parameters in the long-term evaluation. Therapy was concluded in one patient after the 9th pulse due to pulmonary embolism. The increase of FVIII activity is a consequence of treatment with IVMP and occurs after each pulse. In patients with additional risk factors of VTE , anticoagulation prophylaxis should be considered.
