 Results of a study to estimate the prevalence and severity of delays in wireless updates of smart-pump drug libraries across a large group of U.S. hospitals are reported. A prolonged smart-pump drug library update may result in patient harm if a pump is programmed with an incorrect limit setting at the time of drug administration. A retrospective study was conducted using smart-pump alert data extracted from the Regenstrief National Center for Medical Device Informatics ( REMEDI) database. The study sample consisted of 49 hospitals in 5 states across the Midwest and Kentucky operated by 12 health systems; all the facilities used a specific brand of smart pump ( BD Alaris , Beckton , Dickinson and Company) capable of generating alert data and had consistently contributed alert data to the REMEDI database over a 2-year period. An update delay was defined as the interval from the time a drug library version was replaced to the time of the last infusion alert triggered by the previous version during the study period. Of the 12 health systems , 11 were found to have had drug library update delays during the study period , with delay medians ranging from 22 to 192 days. The overall delay minimum and maximum durations were 0 and 661 days. Substantial delays in completion of wireless updates of smart-pump drug libraries were common across a group of hospitals of various sizes.
