 Obese patients subjected to bariatric surgery have a high probability of presenting complications that worsen with the use of opioids and can be reduced thanks to anaesthetic techniques like opioid-free anaesthetics ( OFA). The risk of having to convert the laparoscopic surgical technique into open surgery is one of the criticisms aimed at this anaesthetic modality , facing the possibility of there not being a correct sympathetic or nociceptive control. We present the case of a patient scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery who , while maintaining OFA , was converted to open surgery ( exploratory laparoscopy) , with correct control achieved of both haemodynamics and perioperative pain.
