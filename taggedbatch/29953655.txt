 There is some controversy as for the roles played by tumor growth factor-β ( TGF-β) , interleukin-1β ( IL-1β) , and IL-22 in the onset process of type 2 diabetes ( T2D). The main aim of this project was to examine serum levels of TGF-β , IL-1β , and IL-22 in the new cases and long period T2D patients as well as healthy controls. In this study , 115 new T2D patient cases ( group 1) , 434 T2D patients who have suffered from the disease more than 2 years ( group 2) , and 104 healthy controls have been selected from 6240 ( 3619 females) patients who were under study population from Kerman Coronary Artery Disease Risk Factor Study. Serum levels of TGF-β , IL-1β , and IL-22 have been evaluated using commercial kits. Serum levels of TGF-β and IL-1β significantly increased , while IL-22 decreased in 2 groups in comparison to healthy controls. Serum levels of IL-22 , but not TGF-β and IL-1β , were significantly decreased in group 1 in comparison to healthy controls. There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 as for the cytokine levels. Serum levels of IL-22 increased in the females in group 2 when compared to females in group 1. It appears that TGF-β and IL-1β participate in the induction of inflammation<symptom> after establishment of T2D , while decrease in IL-22 may be considered as a key factor for onset of the disease. Gender can also be considered as the main risk factor for variation in cytokine levels.
