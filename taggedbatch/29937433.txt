 Diabetes is a complex group of metabolic disorders that can be accompanied by several comorbidities , including increased risk of early death. Decades of diabetes research have elucidated many genetic drivers of normal islet function and dysfunction; however , a lack of suitable treatment options suggests our knowledge about the disease remains incomplete. The establishment of long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) , once dismissed as `` junk '' DNA , as essential gene regulators in many biological processes has redefined the central role for RNA in cells. Studies showing that misregulation of lncRNAs can lead to disease have contributed to the emergence of lncRNAs as attractive candidates for drug targeting. These findings underscore the need to reexamine islet biology in the context of a regulatory role for RNA. This review will
