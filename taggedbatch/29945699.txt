 Antimicrobial resistance ( AMR) , a major public health threat , is strongly associated with human antibiotic consumption. Influenza-like illnesses ( ILI) account for substantial inappropriate antibiotic use; patient understanding and expectations probably play an important role. This study aimed to investigate what drives patient expectations of antibiotics for ILI and particularly whether AMR awareness , risk preferences ( attitudes to taking risks with health) or time preferences ( the extent to which people prioritise good health today over good health in the future) play a role. In 2015 , a representative online panel survey of 2,064 adults in the United Kingdom was asked about antibiotic use and effectiveness for ILI. Explanatory variables in multivariable regression included AMR awareness , risk and time preferences and covariates. The tendency not to prioritise immediate gain over later reward was independently strongly associated with greater awareness that antibiotics are inappropriate for ILI. Independently , believing antibiotics were effective for ILI and low AMR awareness significantly predicted reported antibiotic use. However , 272 ( 39 %) of those with low AMR awareness said that the AMR information we provided would lead them to ask a doctor for antibiotics more often , significantly more than would do so less often , and in contrast to those with high AMR awareness ( p < 0.0001). Information campaigns to reduce AMR may risk a paradoxical consequence of actually increasing public demand for antibiotics. Public antibiotic stewardship campaigns should be tested on a small scale before wider adoption.
