 Soluble TGF-β1 type II receptor ( sTβRII) via TGF-β1 inhibition could inhibit hepatic fibrosis<disease> , but over-dosage triggers autoimmune responses. To test whether the use of a TGF-β1-responsive collagen I promoter COL1A1 , via generating a feedback loop to TGF-β1 level , could offer accurate control on sTβRII expression. Recombinant adenoviruses with COL1A1 ( Ad-COL-sTβRII/Luc) or CMV promoter ( Ad-CMV-sTβRII/Luc) were constructed and characterized. Inhibition of TGF-β activity was determined both in vitro and in vivo. Total and bioactive TGF-β , hepatic fibrosis<disease> scale , α-SMA , collagen levels , and liver function were determined. COL1A1 , but not CMV , responded to TGF-β1 in vitro. Both in vitro and in vivo , Ad-COL-sTβRII could significantly , but not completely inhibit TGF-β1 activity while Ad-CMV-sTβRII almost completely inhibited TGF-β1 activity. As evidenced by fibrosis<disease> scale , α-SMA , and collagen levels in liver tissue , Ad-COL-sTβRII and Ad-CMV-sTβRII had comparable efficacies in treating hepatic fibrosis<disease>. Ad-COL-sTβRII was better than Ad-CMV-sTβRII in liver function restore. Ad-CMV-sTβRII , but not Ad-COL-sTβRII , induced high level of anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm antibodies in rats. COL1A1 can precisely control sTβRII expression to inhibit excessive bioactive TGF-β level and thus inhibit hepatic fibrosis<disease> but without inducing autoimmune responses.
