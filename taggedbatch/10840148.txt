 Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy ( DPHL) is a unique clinical entity that presents with cognitive impairment days to weeks after an episode of acute hypoxic brain injury. Frequently hypoxia is unrecognized as a mechanism for clinical decline and extensive workup ensues. We present two cases of DPHL highlighting the neuroimaging findings. In both patients , a cerebral hypoxic event was followed by a recovery phase with subsequent delayed clinical decline. Patient 1 suffered hypoxia from drug-induced respiratory<symptom> depression<symptom> and lack of post-operative positive airway pressure ( PAP) support. Her neurological exam on follow-up revealed progressive cognitive decline. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) brain showed bilateral white matter changes involving the centrum semiovale. Patient 2 developed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure<symptom> during an endobronchial biopsy procedure and was found to have multiple air emboli on computed tomography ( CT) head scan. She was initially in a drug-induced coma<symptom> for her seizures<symptom>. Electroencephalography ( EEG) on day 14 of admission showed changes consistent with diffuse encephalopathy. MRI brain showed bilateral white matter changes particularly at the watershed zones and in the centrum semiovale. DPHL is a rare and under-recognized clinical entity that requires clinical suspicion and detailed evaluation for diagnosis. Neuroimaging studies can provide prognostic information regarding the extent of neurological injury.
