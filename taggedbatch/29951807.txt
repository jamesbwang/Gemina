 The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinical efficacy of postoperative non-invasive positive pressure ventilation ( PONIV) after pulmonary lobectomy in patients with lung cancer. From August 2010 and July 2015 , 143 patients with lung cancer who underwent pulmonary lobectomy were retrospectively reviewed. PONIV was used immediately after surgery until the morning of postoperative day ( POD) 1. Arterial blood gas was analyzed before and just after surgery ( POD0) and on POD1. Oxygenation ability was perioperatively assessed by PaO 112 patients received PONIV. From POD0 to POD1 , the PaO PONIV effectively improved oxygenation in patients undergoing pulmonary lobectomy in patients with poor status , especially in patients with PaO
