 It can be difficult for adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) to make the transition from paediatric to adult care. We studied the outcomes of this process and defined what constituted a successful transition. In 2008 , 50 adolescents who attended our IBD transition clinic completed IBD-yourself , a self-efficacy questionnaire that we had previously developed and validated. We approached the subjects in 2014 , two to six years after they transferred to adult care , and 35 agreed to take part in the current study. The outcome of transition was assessed by our newly developed Transition Yourself Score. In addition , the relationship between self-efficacy and the outcome of the transition was measured. The mean age of the patients was 21.8 years , and 69 % suffered from Crohn 's disease. The transition process was successful in 63 % of cases , moderately successful in 31 % and failed in 6 %. A successful transition was associated with effective use of medication and clinical remission at the time of transfer , but could not be predicted by self-efficacy. The Transition Yourself Score will be validated in future studies. Nearly two-thirds ( 63 %) of the adolescents who attended the IBD transition clinic had a successful transition to adult care.
