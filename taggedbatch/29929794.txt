 Organizations are complex with cultures that influence excellence , commitment and job satisfaction. In nursing schools , faculty are required to succeed within the performance driven culture of academic scholarship alongside the organizational culture that influences the work environment. The purpose of this article is to describe the process that a School of Nursing engaged in using complexity science and liberating structures to shift a perceived unhealthy organizational culture to a healthier one. Complexity science focuses on patterns of relationships within a system while Liberating Structures provide strategies for people to identify new patterns of working together which can contribute to culture change. Over two years , faculty identified the culture issues , the desired positive outcomes and implemented an action plan using Liberating Structures such as Shift and Share , Discovery and Action Dialogues , TRIZ ( Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) and 15 % Solutions ( Power to Create Change Now). The work included a focus on understanding culture challenges , uncovering positive practices , and creating new ways to respectfully interact with each other while implementing the work of the School. Culture is ubiquitous , takes time to alter and can be difficult to measure any substantive change , however on evaluation after two years , there was guarded optimism that a healthier culture exists with knowledge of how to continue to build on the work done. While problems still arise , the new knowledge , strength of leadership within faculty and having the understanding and confidence to interact respectfully , continues to build new relationship patterns and a healthier culture within the School.
