 The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of a teaching program , based on Non-Linear Pedagogy , on decision-making and performance in youth soccer players as a function of the type of play action. Our participants were 19 players from the U12 age category. The teaching program , which was based on the application of modified games characterized by a numerical superiority in attack , was used for 14 training sessions. This program was conducted in two phases ( preparation-for-intervention and intervention). Decision-making and execution for pass and dribbling actions were evaluated through the Game Performance Evaluation Tool. The results showed significant differences in favour of the experimental group in decision-making ( p < .000) and the execution of passes ( p = .003) after the intervention. However , such differences were not found for dribbling ( decision-making , p = .402 and execution , p = .143). These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of this type of program for teaching actions with a high tactical component , such as the pass , and a different approach must be considered in actions with a high technical component , such as dribbling. It is necessary to continue developing studies in this line to clarify these issues.
