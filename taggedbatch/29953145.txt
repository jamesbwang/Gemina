 meso-Ethynyl extended aryl-picket calix ( 4) pyrroles 2 and 3 are designed and synthesized by directly anchoring arylethynyl groups at diametrically opposed meso-positions. The critical roles of direct ethynyl linkers are manifested through the isolation of unexpected host-anion conformers of meso-arylethynyl calix ( 4) pyrroles and a significant enhancement in halide binding affinities.
