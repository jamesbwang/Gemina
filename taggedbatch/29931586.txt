 The development of the CNS in vertebrate embryos involves the generation of different sub-types of neurons and glia in a complex but highly-ordered spatio-temporal manner. Zebrafish are commonly used for exploring the development , plasticity and regeneration of the CNS , and the recent development of reliable protocols for isolating and culturing neural stem/progenitor cells ( NSCs/NPCs) from the brain of adult fish now enables the exploration of mechanisms underlying the induction/specification/differentiation of these cells. Here , we refined a protocol to generate proliferating and differentiating neurospheres from the entire brain of adult zebrafish. We demonstrated via RT-qPCR that some isoforms of ip3r , ryr and stim are upregulated/downregulated significantly in differentiating neurospheres , and via immunolabelling that 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate receptor ( IP3R) type-1 and ryanodine receptor ( RyR) type-2 are differentially expressed in cells with neuron- or radial glial-like properties. Furthermore , ATP but not caffeine ( IP3R and RyR agonists , respectively) , induced the generation of Ca
