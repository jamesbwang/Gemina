 The first application of robotic technology in surgery was described in 1985 when a robot was used to define the trajectory for a stereotactic brain biopsy. Following its successful application in a variety of surgical operations , the da Vinci ® robot , the most widely used surgical robot at present , made its clinical debut in otorhinolaryngology and head and neck surgery in 2005 when the first transoral robotic surgery ( TORS) resections of base of tongue neoplasms were reported. Subsequently , the indications for TORS rapidly expanded , and they now include tumours of the oropharynx , hypopharynx , parapharyngeal space , and supraglottic larynx , as well as obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA). The da Vinci ® robot has also been successfully used for scarless-in-the-neck thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy. At present , the main barrier to the wider uptake of robotic surgery is the prohibitive cost of the da Vinci ® robotic system. Several novel , flexible surgical robots are currently being developed that are likely to not only enhance patient safety and expand current indications but also drive down costs , thus making this innovation more widely available. Future directions relate to overlay technology through augmented reality/AR that allows real-time image-guidance , miniaturisation ( nanorobots) , and the development of autonomous robots.
