 Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 ( IDO1) activity links to immune escape of cancers. Inhibition of IDO1 provides a new approach for cancer treatment. Most clinical IDO1 drugs show marginal efficacy as single agents. On basis of molecular docking and pharmacophore modelling , a novel inhibitor Roxyl-WL was discovered with a half maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC50) value of 1 nM against IDO1 and 10-100-fold increased potent activity compared with IDO1 drugs in clinical trials. Roxyl-WL displayed excellent kinase spectrum selectivity with no activity out of the 337 protein kinases. In vitro , Roxyl-WL effectively augmented the proliferation of T cells and reduced the number of regulatory T cell ( Tregs). When administered to melanoma ( B16F10) tumor-bearing mice orally , Roxyl-WL significantly suppressed tumor growth and induced immune response.
