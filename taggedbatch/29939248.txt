 With stories of struggle and dramatic breakthroughs , science has incredible potential to interest the public. However , as the rhetoric of outrage surrounds controversies over science policy there is an urgent need for credible , trusted voices that frame science issues in a way that resonates with a diverse public. A network of informal educators , park rangers , museum docents and designers , and zoo and aquarium interpreters are prepared to do so during millions of visits a year; just where science stories are most meaningfully told-in the places where members of the public are open to learning. Scientific researchers can benefit from partnerships with these intermediaries who are accorded status for their trustworthiness and good will , who have expertise in translating the science using language , metaphors , encounters , and experiences that are appropriate for non-experts. In this volume , we describe and probe examples wherein scientists work productively with informal educators and designers , artists , staff of federal agencies , citizen scientists , and volunteers who bring science into the public eye.
