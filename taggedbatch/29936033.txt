 Penile torsion and chordee may be corrected by a variety of techniques; however , when corporal body disproportion is involved plication may be necessary. Herein we describe a technique of placing oblique plication sutures to simultaneously correct both conditions , which we term `` spiral chordee ''. The spiral Nesbit plication ( SNP) has been performed on 21 boys at our institution. Median preoperative penile torsion and chordee were 49 ° ( range 30-90 °) and 35 ° ( range 15-60 °) respectively. Surgical success was 84.6 % with two patients exhibiting mild residual chordee ( 15 °) requiring no further treatment. This technique provides a simple and effective surgical option for correction of spiral chordee.
