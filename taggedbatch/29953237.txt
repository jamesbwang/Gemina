 Native chemical ligation ( NCL) employing the N-methylbenzimidazolinone ( MeNbz) linker readily provided the linear precursor of a 16-mer peptide that is difficult to obtain by stepwise solid-phase peptide synthesis. NCL and the workup conditions were improved toward a protocol that allows for quantitative removal of the 4-hydroxymercaptophenol additive and subsequent formation of the disulfide bridge in the NCL cocktail by oxidation in air , tolerated by the presence of tris ( hydroxypropyl) phosphine.
