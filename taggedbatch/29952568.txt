 An approach to access 1-substituted isoquinolones has been developed through the addition-cyclization of imines with Grignard reagents in the presence of 2,2 '- dipyridyl. A number of substituted aromatic magnesium reagents were amenable to this process , and the desired products were obtained with excellent yields and outstanding diastereoselectivities ( dr > 99:1). The utility of this convenient approach is demonstrated by the formal synthesis of ( S)- cryptostyline II. Moreover , N-methylmorpholine ( NMM) was found to be an effective additive for the formation of 3-substituted isoindolin-1-ones using one-pot addition-cyclization-deprotection of imine with Grignard reagents.
