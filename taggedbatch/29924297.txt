 Frailty indices ( FIs) measure variation in health between aging individuals. Researching FIs in resources with large-scale genetic and phenotypic data will provide insights into the causes and consequences of frailty. Thus , we aimed to develop an FI using UK Biobank data , a cohort study of 500,000 middle-aged and older adults. An FI was calculated using 49 self-reported questionnaire items on traits covering health , presence of diseases and disabilities , and mental well-being , according to standard protocol. We used multiple imputation to derive FI values for the entire eligible sample in the presence of missing item data ( N = 500,336). To validate the measure , we assessed associations of the FI with age , sex , and risk of all-cause mortality ( follow-up â‰¤ 9.7 years) using linear and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Mean FI in the cohort was 0.125 ( SD = 0.075) , and there was a curvilinear trend toward higher values in older participants. FI values were also marginally higher on average in women than in men. In survival models , 10 % higher baseline frailty ( ie , a 0.1 FI increment) was associated with higher risk of death ( hazard ratio = 1.65; 95 % confidence interval: 1.62-1.68). Associations were stronger in younger participants than in older participants , and in men than in women ( hazard ratios: 1.72 vs. 1.56 , respectively). The FI is a valid measure of frailty in UK Biobank. The cohort 's data are open access for researchers to use , and we provide script for deriving this tool to facilitate future studies on frailty.
