 The role of metal ions in virus-host interactions is largely unknown. In the present computational study , the putative zinc , manganese , magnesium , and iron metalloproteomes of 226 different viruses were identified and then the human proteins interacting the viral metalloproteomes were retrieved through network-based bioinformatics. Protein features such as abundance , function and structurally disorder were classified according to the metal type bound to viral proteins. Likely perturbations of host cellular metal homeostasis by viral metal binders are also discussed. Furthermore , possible molecular linkage between the human proteome infected by viral metalloproteins with twelve neurological disorders was examined by in silico gene network analysis.
