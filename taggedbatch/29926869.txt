 With the increasing demands for high-throughput multiplexed bioassays , quantum dot ( QD)- encoded microbeads as biocarriers for various bioreactions have attracted considerable attention. However , three key requirements for these biocarriers are still longstanding issues: a stable fluorescence intensity , a large encoding capacity and abundant surface functional groups. Here , a novel one-pot strategy is developed , generating functionalized QD-encoded microspheres with a strong fluorescence intensity and optical stability. With poly ( styrene-co-maleic anhydride) ( PSMA) molecules as mediators , the encapsulation of QDs and carboxylation of the bead surface are integrated together , greatly improving the preparation efficiency and guaranteeing their potential application in biodetection. Moreover , the mechanism for preparing QD-doped beads is further proposed , which helps to precisely manipulate the preparation process and accurately encode the beads. Through this approach , a single- and dual-color barcode library of QD-encoded microspheres has been successfully established , which demonstrates their great potential in suspension arrays.
