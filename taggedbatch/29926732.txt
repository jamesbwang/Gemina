 Primary cell models of HIV<pathogen> latency have become tools to both understand the mechanisms involved in the establishment of latency as well as to test pre-clinical strategies towards an HIV-1 cure. These models rely on the infection of CD4 T cells from healthy donors. As such , these models provide an opportunity to explore the role of biological sex , age and HIV<pathogen> status on the establishment and reactivation of latent HIV<pathogen> in vitro. We have used an established primary cell model of latency based on the generation of latently infected central memory CD4 T cells with the CXCR4-strain HIV-1NL4-3 to address whether these variables influence: i) HIV-1NL4-3 replication , ii) establishment of latency , and iii) latency reversal in CD4 T cells. Our results indicate that replication of HIV-1NL4-3 , but not the establishment of latency , is influenced by the age of female but not male donors. Moreover , the frequency of latently infected cells in this model is directly correlated with the levels of productive infection in both male and female donors independent of age. We did not find differences in the ability of five different latency-reversing agents ( LRAs) to reactivate latent HIV-1NL4-3. Finally , we have found that this model can be generated using cells from aviremic participants. In conclusion , we have further characterized the TCM model of latency regarding biological sex and age and demonstrated that this model is suitable for use with cells isolated from aviremic participants , opening the opportunity to use this primary cell model to address cure approaches including ` shock<symptom> and kill ' in HIV-infected individuals.
