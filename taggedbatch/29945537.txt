 An increased risk of vaccine-preventable infections ( VPIs) is seen in people living with HIV<pathogen> ( PLWH) , and current vaccine coverage and immunity is variable. Vaccine passports have the potential to improve vaccine coverage. The objective was to assess how successful a vaccine passport was in improving vaccine coverage in PLWH. Baseline immunity to VPIs was established in PLWH attending a single HIV<pathogen> clinic and vaccinations required were determined based on the BHIVA Vaccination Guidelines ( 2015). The passport was completed and the PLWH informed about additional vaccines they should obtain from primary care. After 6-9 months the passport was reviewed including confirmation if vaccines were given. PLWH satisfaction with the system was evaluated by a survey. Seventy-three PLWH provided sufficient data for analysis. At baseline significant proportions of PLWH were not immune/unvaccinated to the main VPIs , especially human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> , pneumococcus and measles<pathogen>. After the passport was applied immunity improved significantly ( 56 % overall , p < 0.01) for most VPIs; however , full coverage was not achieved. The system was popular with PLWH. The passport was successful in increasing vaccination coverage although full or near-full coverage was not achieved. A more successful service would probably be achieved by commissioning English HIV<pathogen> clinics to provide all vaccines.
