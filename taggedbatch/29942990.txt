 The development of theranostic nanocarriers as an innovative therapy against cancer has been improved by targeting properties in order to optimize the drug delivery to safely achieve its desired therapeutic effect. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the magnetic targeting ( MT) efficiency of ultra-magnetic liposomes ( UML) into CT26 murine colon tumor by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). Dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI was applied to assess the bloodstream circulation time. A novel semi-quantitative method called % I This innovative method of processing MRI images showed the MT efficiency by a % I We have developed a method that allows a semi-quantitative evaluation of targeting efficiency in tumors , which could be applied to different T
