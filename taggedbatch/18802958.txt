 A 67-year-old woman presented with clinical symptoms , radiological findings , and preoperative work-up highly suggestive of advanced stage IV carcinoma of the gallbladder ( CG). An extended cholecystectomy with the excision of adjacent liver segments and loco-regional lymphadenectomy was performed. Final pathology results revealed diffuse xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis<disease> ( XG) with ruptured Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses with tumor-resembling adenomyosis without atypical or malignant cells. There was a reactive inflammatory and fatty degeneration of the adjacent hepatic tissue and a nonspecific inflammatory reaction of the enlarged periportal lymph nodes. The main concern in the management of patients with mass-forming XG is that this benign condition shares strikingly similar clinical , imaging , biochemical , and intraoperative features with advanced CG , which has one of the poorest overall survival rates. Misdiagnosis is not uncommon , which causes significant distress for patients and their families and , in some cases , may result in erroneous treatment. Although the presence of some preoperative imaging findings and/or intraoperative frozen section biopsies may be helpful in suspecting XG , definitive diagnosis is usually delayed until the final pathology result that may come as a surprise. Increasing awareness of this rare , insidious disease will contribute to a better understanding of its biology and natural history and , eventually , help improve management.
