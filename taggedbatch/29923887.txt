 We compared the pharmacokinetic ( PK) profile and electrocardiographic ( ECG) changes in response to intratracheal instillation of flecainide acetate into the left atrium and ventricle with intravenous ( IV) flecainide acetate administration. In 12 closed-chest anesthetized Yorkshire pigs , we monitored QRS complex and PR , JTc , and QTc intervals during sinus rhythm and correlated changes with venous plasma drug concentrations before and at 2 , 5 , 10 , 15 , and 30 min after drug administration. Intratracheal instillation of flecainide ( 0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg , rapid bolus) caused dose/concentration-dependent increases in QRS complex duration of 10 % and 19 % , respectively , at 2 min , coinciding with peak venous plasma levels ( 1688 ± 177 and 2808 ± 217 ng/ml , respectively). IV infusion of flecainide ( 2 mg/kg) over 2 or 10 min similarly prolonged QRS complexes and PR intervals ( both , p < 0.001). Intratracheal flecainide instillation increased PR interval briefly at 5 min. Neither intratracheal nor IV flecainide affected JTc or QTc intervals. Thus , the PK pattern of intratracheal instillation of flecainide is comparable to IV administration , although the absolute plasma concentrations were higher with IV infusion. Both modes of delivery elicited ECG changes that were consistent with the expected pharmacological activity of flecainide.
