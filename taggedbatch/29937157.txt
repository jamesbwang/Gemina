 To assess the extraocular<symptom> muscle thickness and chemosis after treatment with tocilizumab in patients with active Graves ' ophthalmopathy by optical coherence tomography. Case series of five patients with active Graves ' ophthalmopathy ( clinical activity score ≥ 4/10) treated with 4 doses of tocilizumab. These patients had been previously treated with corticosteroids with no response. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography was employed to determine lateral and medial rectus<pathogen> muscle thickness and chemosis before and after 4 doses of tocilizumab given monthly. Scanning was performed at 3 and 9 o'clock ( nasal and temporal). The study included four women and one man with a median age of 52 years ( range: 38-73). Median Graves ' ophthalmopathy activity duration was 17 months ( 12-18). Median medial rectus<pathogen> and determine lateral thicknesses pre-treatment were 249μm ( 174-366) and 337μm ( 142-443) , respectively. Median chemosis was 409μm ( 290-610). After tocilizumab treatment , median muscle thicknesses reduced to 157μm ( 88-187) and 197μm ( 99-290) , respectively ( P = .043; Wilcoxon) and chemosis to 59μm ( 0-78). Median clinical activity score decreased from 5 ( 4-8) to 1 ( 0-3). A reduction in extraocular<symptom> muscle thickness and chemosis was observed after treatment with tocilizumab in Graves ' ophthalmopathy patients using an optical coherence tomography , so this technique could be a useful complementary technique to assess the therapeutic responses.
