 To comment on the latest technology appraisal of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence -LRB- NICE) in osteoporosis. Review of NICE Technology Appraisal ( TA464) on bisphosphonate use in osteoporosis. The NICE appraisal on bisphosphonate use in osteoporosis indicates that treatment with oral bisphosphonates may be instituted at a FRAX 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture above 1 %. Implementation would mean that all women aged 50 years or older are deemed eligible for treatment , a position that would increase the burden of rare long-term side effects across the population. Cost-effectiveness thresholds for low-cost interventions should not be used to set intervention thresholds but rather to validate the implementation of clinically driven intervention thresholds.
