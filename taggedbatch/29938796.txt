 High mountain<disease> ecosystems and their biota are governed by low-temperature conditions and thus can be used as indicators for climate warming impacts on natural ecosystems , provided that long-term data exist. We used data from the largest alpine to nival permanent plot site in the Alps , established in the frame of the Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments ( GLORIA) on Schrankogel in the Tyrolean Alps , Austria , in 1994 , and resurveyed in 2004 and 2014. Vascular plant species richness per plot increased over the entire period , albeit to a lesser extent in the second decade , because disappearance events increased markedly in the latter period. Although presence/absence data could only marginally explain range shift dynamics , changes in species cover and plant community composition indicate an accelerating transformation towards a more warmth-demanding and more drought-adapted vegetation , which is strongest at the lowest , least rugged subsite. Divergent responses of vertical distribution groups of species suggest that direct warming effects , rather than competitive displacement , are the primary causes of the observed patterns. The continued decrease in cryophilic species could imply that trailing edge dynamics proceed more rapidly than successful colonisation , which would favour a period of accelerated species declines.
