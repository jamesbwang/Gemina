 Gingival tissue is reportedly a promising , easily accessible , abundant resource of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSC) for use in various tissue engineering strategies. Human gingival MSC ( HGMSCs) were successfully isolated from gingival tissue and characterized. To analyze in a two-dimensional form , HGMSCs were cultured with basal medium and induced with 25 Âµg/ml of Acalypha indica<pathogen>. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR) and western blot analysis showed the presence of keratinocyte-specific markers , including cytokeratin-5 and involucrin. To further assess its capability for stratification akin to human keratinocytes , HGMSCs were encapsulated in a HyStem
