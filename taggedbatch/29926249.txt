 Surgical options for removing high-grade down-migrated lumbar disc herniations located medial to the pedicle include an extensive laminectomy and facetectomy. A direct percutaneous endoscopic approach through the pedicle for reaching the herniated disc without risk of iatrogenic instability is feasible. The transpedicular approach consists of creating a tunnel through the pedicle. Subsequently , access to the parapedicular epidural space is obtained , and downward migrated disc can be removed. This technique allows to reach migrated herniations medially to the pedicle safely and effectively.
