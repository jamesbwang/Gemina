 To determine differences in health-related quality of life ( HRQoL) , survival and healthcare resource use of critically ill adults with and without sepsis<disease>. We conducted a primary propensity score matched analysis of patients with and without sepsis<disease> enrolled in a large multicentre clinical trial. Outcomes included HRQoL at 6 months , survival to 2 years , length of ICU and hospital admission and cost of ICU and hospital treatment to 2 years. We obtained linked data for 3442 ( 97.3 %) of 3537 eligible patients and matched 806/905 ( 89.0 %) patients with sepsis<disease> with 806/2537 ( 31.7 %) without. After matching , there were no significant differences in the proportion of survivors with and without sepsis<disease> reporting problems with mobility ( 37.8 % vs. 38.7 % , p = 0.86) , self-care ( 24.7 % vs. 26.0 % , p = 0.44) , usual activities ( 44.5 % vs. 46.8 % , p = 0.28) , pain/discomfort ( 42.4 % vs. 41.6 % , p = 0.54) and anxiety/depression ( 36.9 % vs. 37.7 % , p = 0.68). There was no significant difference in survival at 2 years: 482/792 ( 60.9 %) vs. 485/799 ( 60.7 %) ( HR 1.01 , 95 % CI 0.86-1.18 , p = 0.94). The initial ICU and hospital admission were longer for patients with sepsis<disease>: 10.1 ± 11.9 vs. 8.0 ± 9.8 days ( p < 0.0001) and 22.8 ± 21.2 vs. 19.1 ± 19.0 days , ( p = 0.0003) respectively. The cost of ICU admissions was higher for patients with sepsis<disease>: A$ 43,345 ± 46,263 ( $ 35,109 ± 35,043) versus 34,844 ± 38,281 ( $ 28,223 ± 31,007) , mean difference $ 8501 ( $ 6885) , 95 % CI $ 4342-12,660 ( $ 3517 ± 10,254) , p < 0.001 as was the total cost of hospital treatment to 2 years: A$ 74,120 ± 60,750 ( $ 60,037 ± 49,207) versus A$ 65,806 ± 59,856 ( $ 53,302 ± 48,483) , p = 0.005. Critically ill patients with sepsis<disease> have higher healthcare resource use and costs but similar survival and HRQoL compared to matched patients without sepsis<disease>.
