 The intrarenal ghrelin receptor ( GR) is localized to collecting duct ( CD) cells where it increases αENaC-dependent sodium reabsorption in rodents. We hypothesized that chronic GR inhibition with intrarenal GR siRNA lowers blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) in Angiotensin II-dependent hypertension via reductions in αENaC-dependent sodium reabsorption. Uninephrectomized Sprague-Dawley rats ( N = 121) received subcutaneous osmotic pumps for chronic systemic delivery of Angiotensin II or vehicle ( 5 % dextrose in water). Rats also received intrarenal infusion of vehicle , GR siRNA , or scrambled ( SCR) siRNA. In rats receiving intrarenal vehicle or intrarenal SCR siRNA , systemic Angiotensin II infusion increased sodium retention and BP on day 1 , and BP remained elevated throughout the 5-day study. These rats also demonstrated increased CD GR expression after 5 days of infusion. However , intrarenal GR siRNA infusion prevented Angiotensin II-mediated sodium retention on day 1 , induced a continuously negative cumulative sodium balance<symptom> compared with Angiotensin II alone , and reduced BP chronically. Glomerular filtration rate and renal<symptom> blood flow remained unchanged in GR siRNA-infused rats. Systemic Angiotensin II infusion also increased serum aldosterone levels , CD αENaC and pSGK1 expression in rats with intrarenal SCR siRNA; however these effects were not observed in the presence of intrarenal GR siRNA , despite exposure to the same systemic Angiotensin II. These data demonstrate that chronic inhibition of intrarenal GR activity significantly reduces αENaC- dependent sodium retention , resulting in a negative cumulative sodium balance<symptom> , thereby ameliorating Angiotensin II-induced hypertension in rats. Renal GRs represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension and other sodium-retaining states.
