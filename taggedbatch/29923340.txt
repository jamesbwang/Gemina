 p120-catenin ( p120) is an important regulator in the function and stability of E-cadherin. However , the role of p120 in the epidermis is unclear. Previous studies have shown that globally knockout of p120 caused increased epidermal proliferation but little changes in epidermal differentiation and permeability. In the present study , we generated a conditional knockout mouse model and examined epidermal proliferation , differentiation and permeability. The results showed that conditional knockout of p120 in the epidermis caused not only increased epidermal proliferation but also decreased epidermal differentiation and increased permeability. These data suggest that p120 is required for suppressing epidermal proliferation , promoting epidermal differentiation and maintaining permeability barrier function of the epidermis.
