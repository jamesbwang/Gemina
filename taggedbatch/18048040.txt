 Injury triggers a range of systemic effects including inflammation<symptom> and immune responses. This study aimed to compare infectious<disease> disease<disease> admissions after burn and other types of injury using linked hospital admissions data. A retrospective longitudinal study using linked health data of all patients admitted with burns in Western Australia ( Annual age-standardised infectious<disease> disease<disease> admission rates were highest for the burn cohort , followed by the non-burn trauma and uninjured cohorts. Age-standardised admission rates by decade showed different patterns across major categories of infectious<disease> diseases<disease> , with the lower respiratory and skin and soft<disease> tissue<disease> infections<disease> the most common for those with burns and other open trauma. Compared with the uninjured , those with burns had twice the admission rate for infectious<disease> disease<disease> after discharge ( incident rate ratio ( IRR) , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 2.04 , 1.98-2.11) while non-burn trauma experienced 1.74 times higher rates ( 95 % CI: 1.68-1.81). The burn cohort experienced 10 % higher rates of first-time admissions after discharge when compared with the non-burn trauma ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 95 % CI: 1.10 , 1.05-1.15). Compared with the uninjured cohort , incident admissions were highest during the first 30 days after discharge for burns ( HR , 95 % CI: 5.18 , 4.15-6.48) and non-burn trauma ( HR , 95 % CI: 5.06 , 4.03-6.34). While incident rates remained high over the study period , the magnitude decreased with increasing time from discharge: burn vs uninjured: HR , 95 % CI: Burns and non-burn trauma patients had higher admission rates for infectious<disease> diseases<disease> compared with age and gender matched uninjured people. The pattern of annual admission rates for major categories of infectious<disease> diseases<disease> varied across injury groups. Overall , the burn cohort experienced the highest rates for digestive , lower respiratory and skin and soft<disease> tissue<disease> infections<disease>. These results suggest long-term vulnerability to infectious<disease> disease<disease> after injury , possibly related to long-term immune dysfunction.
