 Migratory birds have an important role in transporting ticks and associated tick-borne pathogens over long distances. In this study , 2,793 migratory birds were captured by nets in a ringing station , located in northern Italy , and checked for the presence of ticks. Two-hundred and fifty-one ticks were identified as nymphs and larvae of Ixodes<pathogen> ricinus<pathogen> ( Linnaeus , 1758) and they were PCR-screened for the presence of bacteria belonging to Borrelia<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> sensu lato , Rickettsia<pathogen><disease> spp. , Francisella<pathogen> tularensis<pathogen> and Coxiella<pathogen> burnetii<pathogen>. Four species of Borrelia<pathogen> ( B.<pathogen> garinii<pathogen> , B.<pathogen> afzelii<pathogen> , B.<pathogen> valaisiana<pathogen> and B.<pathogen> lusitaniae<pathogen>) and three species of Rickettsia ( R. monacensis , R.<pathogen> helvetica<pathogen> and Candidatus<pathogen> Rickettsia<pathogen><disease> mendelii) were detected in 74 ( 30 %) and 25 ( 10 %) respectively out of 251 ticks examined. Co-infection with Borrelia<pathogen> spp. and Rickettsia<pathogen><disease> spp. in the same tick sample was encountered in 7 ( 7 %) out of the 99 infected ticks. We report for the first time the presence of Candidatus<pathogen> Rickettsia<pathogen><disease> mendelii in I.<pathogen> ricinus<pathogen> collected on birds in Italy. This study , besides confirming the role of birds in dispersal of I.<pathogen> ricinus<pathogen> , highlights an important route by which tick-borne pathogens might spread across different countries and from natural environments towards urbanised areas.
