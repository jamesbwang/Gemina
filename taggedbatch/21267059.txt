 Homeless people are at high risk of HIV<pathogen> and tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) infection due to living in poor sanitary conditions and practicing high-risk behavior. The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge , attitude , and practice ( KAP) of homeless people in Tehran regarding TB and HIV<pathogen>. Using a convenience sampling , we performed a cross-sectional study on homeless people in Tehran from June to August 2012. Participants aged 18-60 years having at least 10 days of homelessness in the preceding month to the study period were included. All required data were collected through face-to-face interviews conducted using a researcherdesigned questionnaire. Each score in KAP of TB and HIV<pathogen> was separately divided by the maximum score and multiplied by 100 to attain percentage scores. The mean scores were compared using analysis of variance ( ANOVA) and student 's t test. A Tukey test was used for post hoc analysis and two-by-two comparisons. In this study , 593 participants consisting of 513 men and 80 women were included. The mean age of the participants was 41.74 Â± 0.45 years. Moreover , the total mean score of KAP toward HIV<pathogen> was 79.24 ( 95 % CI: 77.36 , 81.12) , 57.13 ( 95 % CI: 55.12 , 59.14) , and 21.14 ( 95 % CI: 18.35 , 23.93) , respectively. The total mean score of knowledge and practice regarding TB was 62.04 ( 95 % CI: 59.94 , 64.14) and 42.57 ( 95 % CI: 40.36 , 44.78) , respectively. Although a relatively acceptable knowledge was detected in this high-risk population , practices regarding TB and HIV<pathogen> showed some weaknesses<symptom>. Developing special programs to improve the healthy behavior of this population is highly recommended.
