 The early clinical manifestations of macular infarction secondary to subconjunctival gentamicin ( Gentak; Akorn , Lake Forest , IL) use in an aphakic eye were documented sequentially on swept-source optical coherence tomography ( OCT) and fundus fluorescein angiography. The first recorded event after drug toxicity was macular detachment , along with disorganization of outer retinal layers in about 12 hours. The changes in inner retinal layers occurred after 36 hours had elapsed. OCT-documented initial damage to outer retinal layers could be due to the susceptibility of first order retinal neurons , followed by subsequent inner retinal layer involvement and ischemia. This helps in understanding pathogenesis of a catastrophic complication of subconjunctival gentamicin injection commonly used for endophthalmitis<disease> prophylaxis.
