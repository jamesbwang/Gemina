 Barbecue ( BBQ) is one of the most popular cooking activities with charcoal worldwide and produces abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) and particulate matter. Size distribution and clothing-air partitioning of particle-bound PAHs are significant for assessing potential health hazards to humans due to exposure to BBQ fumes , but have not been examined adequately. To address this issue , particle and gaseous samples were collected at 2-m and 10-m distances from a cluster of four BBQ stoves. Personal samplers and cotton clothes were carried by volunteers sitting near the BBQ stoves. Particle-bound PAHs ( especially 4-6 rings) derived from BBQ fumes were mostly affiliated with fine particles in the size range of 0.18-1.8 Î¼m. High molecular-weight PAHs were mostly unimodal peaking in fine particles and consequently had small geometric mean diameters and standard deviations. Source diagnostics indicated that particle-bound PAHs in BBQ fumes were generated primarily by combustion of charcoal , fat content in food , and oil. The influences of BBQ fumes on the occurrence of particle-bound PAHs decreased with increasing distance from BBQ stoves , due to increased impacts of ambient sources , especially by petrogenic sources and to a lesser extent by wind speed and direction. Octanol-air and clothing-air partition coefficients of PAHs obtained from personal air samples were significantly correlated to each other. High molecular-weight PAHs had higher area-normalized clothing-air partition coefficients in cotton clothes , i.e. , cotton fabrics may be a significant reservoir of higher molecular-weight PAHs. Particle-bound PAHs from barbecue fumes are generated largely from charcoal combustion and food-charred emissions and mainly affiliated with fine particles.
