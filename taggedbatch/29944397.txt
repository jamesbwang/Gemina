 To evaluate the virulence of avian pathogenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( APEC) isolates obtained from colibacillosis cases associated with pericarditis<disease> , perihepatitis , and salpingitis , the embryo lethality assay and experimental infection model in chicks were used in this study. According to the established criteria based on mortality in the embryo lethality assay for evaluating the virulence of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates , 23 of the 26 APEC isolates associated with pericarditis<disease> and perihepatitis and 8 of the 20 isolates associated with salpingitis were found to be virulent. Isolate D137 , which had been obtained from a case with pericarditis<disease> and perihepatitis and had an embryo mortality of 92 % , and isolate D445 , which had been obtained from a case with pericarditis<disease> and perihepatitis and had an embryo mortality of 17 % , were used for the experimental infection. Four of the five 11-day-old chickens inoculated through the air sac with isolate D137 died 1 day postinoculation , and the challenge strain was recovered from the air sac , pericardial sac , or liver; however , colibacillosis lesions<symptom> were found in only one of the five birds postmortem. All five chicks inoculated with isolate D445 survived for 7 days postinoculation and exhibited airsacculitis or pericarditis<disease> lesions<symptom> at 7 days postinoculation; the challenge strain was not recovered from the lesions<symptom> postmortem. The results obtained in this study suggest that the different APEC isolates tested cause illness in chickens through distinct pathogenesis.
