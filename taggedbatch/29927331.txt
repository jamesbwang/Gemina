 The objective of this study was to compare the prognoses of patients with low- and high-risk rectal cancer detected by MRI who were treated without neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( NCRT) and to determine independent risk factors. This retrospective study included 185 patients with pathologically proven rectal adenocarcinoma who were treated without NCRT. Cancer was defined as high risk if one or more of the following factors were present: extramural depth of tumor invasion greater than 5 mm or stage T4a or T4b for tumor in the mid or high rectum; involvement of intersphincteric space , levators , or adjacent organs for tumor in the low rectum; extramural venous invasion ( EMVI); or circumferential resection margin ( CRM) involvement. Patients without any of those risk factors were placed in the low-risk group. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to compare the survival outcomes between the two groups and to investigate the univariate and multivariate influences of the risk factors. Cancer was deemed to be low risk in 65 ( 35.1 %) patients and high risk in 120 ( 64.9 %) patients. The two patient groups had statistically significant differences in 3-year actuarial overall survival ( OS; 100 % vs 88.3 % , p = 0.0044) , disease-free survival ( DFS; 92.3 % vs 60.0 % , p < 0.0001) , and local recurrence ( LR; 1.5 % vs 10.0 % , p = 0.0297). CRM involvement was identified as an independent risk factor for OS ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 4.78; 95 % CI , 1.24-18.45) , DFS ( HR , 2.44; 95 % CI , 1.24-4.81) , and LR ( HR , 3.92; 95 % CI , 1.07-14.41). Moreover , EMVI was identified as an independent risk factor for DFS ( HR , 2.46; 95 % CI , 1.28-4.74). The LR and long-term survival of patients in the low-risk group were more favorable than those of patients in the high-risk group. EMVI and CRM status were independent risk factors.
