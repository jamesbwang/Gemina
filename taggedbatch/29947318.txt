 The present study explored recipients ' perceptions of food charity and their suggested improvements in inner-city Perth , Western Australia. In-depth interviews were conducted with charitable food service ( CFS) recipients. Transcripts were thematically analysed using a phenomenological approach. Interviews were conducted at two CFS in inner-city Perth. Fourteen adults. The recipients ' journeys to a reliance on CFS were varied and multifactorial , with poverty , medical issues and homelessness common. The length of time recipients had relied on food charity ranged from 8 months to over 40 years. Most were ` grateful yet resigned ' , appreciative of any food and resigned to the poor quality , monotony and their unmet individual preferences. They wanted healthier food , more variety and better quality. Accessing services was described as a ` full-time job ' fraught with unreliable information and transport difficulties. They called for improved information and assistance with transport. ` Eroded dignity ' resulted from being fed without any choice and queuing for food in public places , often in a volatile environment. ` Food memories and inclusion ' reflected a desire for commensality. Recipients suggested services offer choice and promote independence , focusing on their needs both physical and social. Although grateful , long-term CFS recipients described what constitutes a voluntary failure. Their service improvement recommendations can help meet their nutritional and social needs. A successful CFS provides a food service that prioritises nutritious , good-quality food and individual need , while promoting dignity and social inclusion , challenging in the current Australian context.
