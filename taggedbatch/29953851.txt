 The Hippo pathway is crucial in organ size control , and its dysregulation contributes to tumorigenesis. TAZ is an essential molecule containing a WW domain in Hippo pathway and serves as transcription co-activator to modulate cell proliferation and induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition in different human cancers , including pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In this study , we found that TAZ
