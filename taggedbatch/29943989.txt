 ( +)- Fastigiatine is a complex alkaloid isolated from the alpine club moss Lycopodium fastigatum , most commonly found in New Zealand. It has been the subject of two successful synthetic campaigns. A second-generation route toward fastigiatine was developed to resolve two problematic steps from our initial synthesis. Selective reduction and protection of the C13 ketone improved the yield and reliability of the dibromocarbene ring expansion step. In the prior synthesis , cuprate addition to the C10 enone generated a 1:1 mixture of isomers in an advanced intermediate. Protection of the C13 alcohol with a large silyl group changed the conformational preference of the enone and led to a more selective conjugate addition to produce the desired Î²-epimer at C10. MacMillan 's decarboxylative photoredox addition method proved to be more practical than the prior aminomethyl cuprate addition chemistry. The second-generation synthesis is longer than the original but improves the selectivity and reproducibility of the overall route.
