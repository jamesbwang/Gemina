 Virtually all organisms require iron and have evolved to obtain this element in free or chelated forms. Under anaerobic or low pH conditions commonly encountered by numerous pathogens , iron predominantly exists in the ferrous ( Fe2 +) form. The ferrous iron transport ( Feo) system is the only widespread mechanism dedicated solely to bacterial ferrous iron import , and this system has been linked to pathogenic virulence , bacterial colonization , and microbial survival. The canonical feo operon encodes for three proteins that comprise the Feo system: FeoA , a small cytoplasmic Î²-barrel protein; FeoB , a large , polytopic membrane protein with a soluble G-protein domain capable of hydrolyzing GTP; and FeoC , a small , cytoplasmic protein containing a winged-helix motif. While previous studies have revealed insight into soluble and fragmentary domains of the Feo system , the chief membrane-bound component FeoB remains poorly studied. However , recent advances have demonstrated that large quantities of intact FeoB can be overexpressed , purified , and biophysically characterized , revealing glimpses into FeoB function. Two models of full-length FeoB have been published , providing starting points for hypothesis-driven investigations into the mechanism of FeoB-mediated ferrous iron transport. Finally , in vivo studies have begun to shed light on how this system functions as a unique multicomponent complex. In light of these new data , this review will summarize what is known about the Feo system , including recent advancements in FeoB structure and function.
