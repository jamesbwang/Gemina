 As targeted drug therapy is increasingly applied in the treatment of colon cancer , understanding and managing the adverse reactions of patients is becoming increasingly important. The present review examines the mechanisms of and adverse reactions to the most commonly used targeted drugs for colon cancer , and discusses methods of coping with these adverse reactions. Approved targeted drugs for metastatic colon cancer include monoclonal antibodies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) , including bevacizumab , ziv-aflibercept and regorafenib , and monoclonal antibodies targeting epithelial growth factor receptor ( EGFR) , including cetuximab and panitumumab. The present review assesses the major adverse effects of these drugs and methods of dealing with reactions to them. VEGF inhibitors primarily result in cardiovascular and kidney problems. Meanwhile , EGFR receptor inhibitors are frequently reported to cause rashes<symptom> , diarrhea<disease><symptom> and hypertension , and are reviewed from the point of view of resulting electrolyte disturbances.
