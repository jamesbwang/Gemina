 The World Health Organization recommends newborns to be breastfed but this may be challenging if the mother needs to be treated for depression<symptom> , since strong evidence to inform treatment choice is missing. Areas covered: We provide a critical review of the literature to guide clinicians who are considering sertraline for the management of depression<symptom> during postpartum. Expert opinion: Sertraline is one of the safest antidepressants during breastfeeding. In most cases , women already taking sertraline should be advised to breastfeed and continue the medication. We recommend to begin with low doses and to slowly increase the dose up , with careful monitoring of the newborn for adverse effects ( irritability<symptom> , poor<symptom> feeding<symptom> , or uneasy sleep , especially if the child was born premature or had low<symptom> weight at birth). The target dose should be the lowest effective. When feasible , child exposure to the medication may be reduced by avoiding breastfeeding at the time when the antidepressant milk concentration is at its peak. A decision to switch to sertraline from ongoing and effective treatment should be taken only after a scrupulous evaluation of the potential risks and benefits of switching versus continuing the ongoing medication while monitoring the infant carefully.
