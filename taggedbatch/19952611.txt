 Many flaps have been described for reconstruction of lower extremity defects , including , Latissimus Dorsi , Rectus<pathogen> abdominis , Anterolateral thigh perforator flaps , each having advantages and disadvantages. The defect location , size and specific geometric pattern of defect influences the type of flap that can be used. In this case series , we describe the specific situations where the use of chimeric latissimus dorsi-serratus anterior ( LD + SA) free flaps are of advantage in providing complete wound<disease><symptom> cover. Case records of all patients who underwent LD + SA free flap transfer for lower extremity trauma at Amandeep Hospital , from Feb 2006 to Feb 2017 were reviewed. Patients were categorised based on the anatomical location and size of defect. The method of usage of the chimeric segments , recipient vessels and type of anastomosis were noted. Flap complications , if any were reviewed. 47 patients with lower limb defects were included in the study. All cases were post traumatic in nature. Defect size ranged from 180 sq cm to 1050 sq cm. Average defect size was 487.70 sq cm. All patients underwent soft<disease> tissue reconstruction with LD + SA flap. Complete wound<disease><symptom> cover was obtained. Latissimus dorsi + Serratus anterior free tissue transfer is an effective , reliable method of providing cover to extensive lower limb traumatic defects with minimal donor site morbidity , with added freedom of inset and flap positioning. Specific use is seen in patients with broad proximal defect , long defect in the leg , defects involving adjacent anatomical areas and in large defect with dead space.
