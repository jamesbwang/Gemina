 The prognostic nutritional index is an effective prognostic tool used in gastrointestinal surgeries. However , its value has not been verified in cardiovascular surgeries. This study aimed to investigate its utility in hemodialysis-dependent patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We retrospectively reviewed data of 110 hemodialysis-dependent patients who underwent cardiac surgery between January 2006 and July 2016. 20 variables were evaluated for short- and long-term mortality prediction. Patients were divided into high and low prognostic nutritional index groups with values > 34 ( n = 90) and ≤ 34 ( n = 20) , respectively. Preoperative characteristics and surgical outcomes were compared between both groups. Overall , the in-hospital mortality rate was 9 % ( n = 10) and the 1- , 3- , and 5-year actual survival rates were 69 % , 58 % , and 40 % , respectively. Univariate analysis for hospital death revealed age ≥ 70 years , body mass index ≤ 18 kg/m
