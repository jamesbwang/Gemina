 To compare the nephrotoxic effects of iodixanol and iopamidol in patients undergoing peripheral angiography. Patients scheduled for peripheral angiography were randomly assigned to the iodixanol group ( n = 463) and iopamidol group ( n = 458). The primary endpoint was the incidence of contrast associated acute kidney injury ( CA-AKI) , which was defined as an increase ≥ 25 % or ≥ 44.2 µmol/l ( 0.5 mg/dl) in serum creatinine ( SCr) from baseline within 72 h after receiving contrast media ( CM). The secondary endpoints were the mean peak SCr increase within 72 h after receiving CM and major adverse renal events ( SCr increased by two times after 30 days , the need for dialysis treatment , rehospitalization for acute<symptom> renal<symptom> failure<symptom> , or kidney-related death) during hospitalization and within 30 day postdischarge. The incidence of CA-AKI did not differ significantly between the iodixanol group and iopamidol group ( 18.1 % vs. 16.8 %; p = 0.595). There was no significant difference in the mean peak SCr increase between the iodixanol group and iopamidol group ( 10.4 ± 13.0 vs. 10.6 ± 14.3 µmol/l , p = 0.919). There were four patients ( 1 ( 0.2 %) patient in the iodixanol group and 1 ( 0.7 %) patients in the iopamidol group , p = 0.609) with doubling of SCr; no other adverse renal events were observed. Our data showed that the nephrotoxicity of iodixanol was comparable with that of iopamidol in patients undergoing peripheral angiography.
