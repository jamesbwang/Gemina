 The characteristic functionality of ferroelectric materials is due to the symmetry of their crystalline structure. As such , ferroelectrics lend themselves to design approaches that manipulate this structural symmetry by introducing extrinsic strain. Using in situ dark-field X-ray microscopy to map lattice distortions around deeply embedded domain walls and grain boundaries in BaTiO
