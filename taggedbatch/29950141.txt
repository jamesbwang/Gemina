 Necrotizing enterocolitis<disease> ( NEC) is a potentially fatal illness in premature neonates. Tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) and autophagy are associated with the pathogenesis of NEC. This study aimed to explore whether TNF-α might regulate apoptosis in neonatal NEC model cells IEC-6 via regulation of autophagy. NEC rat model was induced by hand feeding and exposure to asphyxia/cold-stress for histologic examination. The NEC in vitro model ( IEC-6/ NEC cells) was established by stimulating the intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6 with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS , 100 μg/mL) for 3 h to investigate the effects of TNF-α on IEC-6 proliferation and apoptosis. In this study , NEC rats showed decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA) expression , increased TUNEL-positive cells , higher expression of TNF-α , p-ERK1/ 2 , and autophagy-related proteins in rat small intestine compared with their controls. Additionally , the LPS-stimulated IEC-6/ NEC cells showed a significantly decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis compared with the control cells. Furthermore , the LPS-stimulated IEC-6/ NEC cells exhibited enhanced autophagy level , as evidenced by a dose-dependent increase in Beclin-1 protein expression , LC3II/LC3I ratio and accumulation of MDC-positive autophagic vacuoles. Moreover , inhibition of autophagy by wortmannin or LY294002 significantly abolished the LPS-mediated decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of IEC-6/ NEC cells. Results also showed that inhibition of ERK1/2 pathway using U0126 significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced autophagy. Furthermore , the TNF-α-mediated inhibition of IEC-6 proliferation and promotion of IEC-6 apoptosis was abolished by U0126. Our findings demonstrated that TNF-α might induce autophagy through ERK1/2 pathway to regulate apoptosis in neonatal NEC cells IEC-6. Our study enhances our understanding of neonatal NEC pathogenesis.
