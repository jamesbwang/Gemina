 Acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) is the most common type of leukemia<disease> in adults. Sunitinib , a multikinase inhibitor , was the first Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ( FLT3) inhibitor clinically used against AML. Off-target effects are a major concern for multikinase inhibitors. As targeted delivery may reduce such undesired side effects , our goal was to develop novel amino acid substituted derivatives of sunitinib which are potent candidates to be used conjugated with antibodies and peptides. In the current paper we present the synthesis , physicochemical and in vitro characterization of sixty two Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication ( FLT3-ITD) mutant kinase inhibitors , bearing amino acid moieties , fit to be conjugated with peptide-based delivery systems via their carboxyl group. We determined the solubility , pK
