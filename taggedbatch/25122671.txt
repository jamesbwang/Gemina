 Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( RTKIs) are used as targeted therapies for patients diagnosed with cancer with highly expressed receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs) , including the platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR) and c-Kit receptor. Resistance to targeted therapies is partially due to the activation of alternative pro-survival signaling pathways , including cyclooxygenase ( COX) -2. In this study , we validated the effects of two RTKIs , axitinib and AB1010 , in combination with COX inhibitors on the V-akt murine thymoma oncogene homolog 1 ( Akt) and COX-2 signaling pathways in bladder cancer cells. The expression of several RTKs and their downstream signaling targets was analyzed by Western blot ( WB) analysis in human and canine bladder transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC) cell lines. The effects of RTKIs and COX inhibitors in bladder TCC cells were assessed by MTS for cell viability , by Caspase-3/ 7 and Annexin V assay for apoptosis , by WB analysis for detection of COX-2 and Akt signaling pathways , and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of prostaglandin E2 ( PGE All tested TCC cells expressed the c-Kit and PDGFRα receptors , except human 5637 cells that had low RTKs expression. In addition , all tested cells expressed COX-1 , COX-2 , Akt , extracellular signal regulated kinases 1/2 , and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhance of activated B cells proteins , except human UM-UC-3 cells , where no COX-2 expression was detected by WB analysis. Both RTKIs inhibited cell viability and increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in tested bladder TCC cells , which positively correlated with their expression levels of the PDGFRα and c-Kit receptors. RTKIs increased the expression of COX-2 in h-5637 and K9TCC # 1Lillie cells. Co-treatment of indomethacin inhibited AB1010-induced COX-2 expression leading to an additive effect in inhibition of cell viability and PGE Co-treatment of RTKIs with indomethacin inhibited cell viability and AB1010-induced COX-2 expression resulting in decreased PGE
