 To investigate the effect of silencing NSD2 gene by RNA interference on the proliferation , apoptosis and the alteration of Akt/ mTOR signaling pathway in diffuse large B cell lymphoma OCI-Ly3 cells. The shRNA targeting NSD2 gene was transfected into OCI-Ly3 cells by lentivirus infection. The NSD2 mRNA and protein were detected by real time Q-PCR and Western blot , respectively. The cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 and apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. The expressions of BCL-2 , BAX , caspase-3 , Akt , p-Akt , p-mTOR , p-P70S6K , H3K36me2 were detected by Western blot. After transfecting the OCI-Ly3 cells by NSD2-shRNA for 72 h , the expressions of NSD2 mRNA and protein both were down-regulated ( P < 0.05) , the proliferation rate of cells in NSD2 shRNA group was significantly lower than that in control and Neg shRNA groups ( P < 0.05); the apoptosis rate of cells in NSD2 shRNA group was significantly higher than that in control and neg-shRNA group ( 30.37 ± 4.22) % vs 1.36 ± 0.52 % and 2.17 ± 1.43) % ( P < 0.05); the expressions of BAX and caspase-3 were up-regulated , while the expression of BCL-2 was down-regulated; the H3K36me2 level significantly decreased as compared with control group , no obvious decrease of the total protein level of AKT was found , but the expressions of p-Akt , p-mTOR and p-70S6K were down-regulated. The silencing NSD2 gene can inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of OCI-Ly3 cells , their mechanisms may relate with regulating the H3K36me2 level , specifically inhibiting the activivty of AKT/mTOR signal pathway.
