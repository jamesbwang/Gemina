 Land-use and climate change are among the greatest threats facing biodiversity , but understanding their combined effects has been hampered by modelling and data limitations , resulting in part from the very different scales at which land-use and climate processes operate. I combine two different modelling paradigms to predict the separate and combined ( additive) effects of climate and land-use change on terrestrial vertebrate communities under four different scenarios. I predict that climate-change effects are likely to become a major pressure on biodiversity in the coming decades , probably matching or exceeding the effects of land-use change by 2070. The combined effects of both pressures are predicted to lead to an average cumulative loss of 37.9 % of species from vertebrate communities under ` business as usual ' ( uncertainty ranging from 15.7 % to 54.2 %). Areas that are predicted to experience the effects of both pressures are concentrated in tropical grasslands and savannahs. The results have important implications for the conservation of biodiversity in future , and for the ability of biodiversity to support important ecosystem functions , upon which humans rely.
