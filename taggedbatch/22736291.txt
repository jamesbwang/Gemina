 This review is to provide an update on the current understanding of rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> ( RA) development related to disease development prior to the onset clinically apparent synovitis<symptom> and opportunities for disease prevention. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that serum elevations of autoantibodies rheumatoid factor and antibodies to citrullinated protein/peptide antigens ( ACPA) are highly predictive of future development of IA/RA. This has underpinned the development of several prevention trials in RA. The full results from most of these prevention trials are pending , but ultimately , they should further inform several critical issues in RA prevention including identification and enrollment of individuals at high risk of imminent RA , the efficacy , safety and cost-effectiveness of prevention , and potentially the identification of new targets for prevention. Results from studies in RA prevention as well as other ongoing natural history studies of RA will help to change the paradigm of how RA is managed , potentially adding prevention to the possibilities for management.
