 Controversy exists regarding the optimal mode of delivery for fetuses with open neural tube defects. To compare neurological outcomes among infants with open neural tube defects who underwent vaginal compared with caesarean delivery. Electronic databases MEDLINE , EMBASE , Scopus , and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched from inception to November 2017. Eligible studies included observational or randomised studies comparing vaginal and caesarean delivery in pregnancies with fetal open neural tube defects who did not undergo prenatal repair. Two reviewers independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles. Outcomes were compared between vaginal and caesarean delivery and prelabour caesarean versus exposure to labour. The primary outcome was motor-anatomic level difference. Secondary outcomes included shunt requirement , sac disruption , meningitis<disease><symptom> , and ambulation at 2 years. Meta-analysis was performed and mean difference or odds ratios with 95 % CI were calculated. Of 201 abstracts identified in the primary search , nine studies ( 672 women) met the eligibility criteria. Comparing vaginal and caesarean delivery , there was no significant difference in motor-anatomic level difference ( mean difference -0.10 , 95 % CI -0.58 to 0.38; I Caesarean delivery was not associated with improved neurological outcomes among fetuses with open neural tube defects. Available evidence does not support routine caesarean delivery for fetuses with open neural tube defects.
