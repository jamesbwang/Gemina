 The article provides a review of the state-of-art non-destructive testing ( NDT) methods used for evaluation of integrated circuit ( IC) packaging. The review identifies various types of the defects and the capabilities of most common NDT methods employed for defect detection. The main aim of this paper is to provide a detailed review on the common NDT methods for IC packaging addressing their principles of operation , advantages , limitations and suggestions for improvement. The current methods such as , X-ray , scanning acoustic microscopy ( SAM) , infrared thermography ( IRT) , magnetic current imaging ( MCI) and surface acoustic waves ( SAW) are explicitly reviewed. The uniqueness of the paper lies in comprehensive comparison of the current NDT methods , recommendations for the improvements , and introduction of new candidate NDT technologies , which can be adopted for IC packaging.
