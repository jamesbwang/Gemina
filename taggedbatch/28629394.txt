 Maternal mortality and morbidity remain unacceptably high in developing countries. Behind every maternal death , many other women suffered from acute and chronic obstetric complications. Women who survive severe<pathogen><disease><symptom> acute maternal morbidities/near miss have many characteristics in common with maternal death events particularly on risk factors. Ethiopia is among countries with high maternal mortality and morbidities in sub-Saharan Africa. However there is scarce evidence on risk factors of severe<pathogen><disease><symptom> acute maternal morbidities in Ethiopia. Therefore this study aimed to identify predictors of maternal near miss among women admitted in Gurage zone hospitals , south Ethiopia , 2017. Hospital based case control study was conducted to assess predictors of maternal near miss among women admitted in five hospitals of Gurage zone , South Ethiopia. Data of 229 ( 77 cases and 152 controls) women were included in the analysis. Cases were women admitted due to severe<pathogen><disease><symptom> acute maternal morbidity while controls were women admitted for normal labor or women admitted due to mild to moderate obstetric complications. Cases were identified by validated-disease specific criteria. Then , two controls were selected for each verified case using lottery method among eligible women. Data were collected using interviewer administered questionnaire and reviewing patients ' records. Data were entered using Epi Info 7 and analyzed by SPSS 21. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to identify independent predictors of maternal near miss. Majority of cases were admitted due to dystocia ( 57.1 %) and obstetric hemorrhage<symptom> ( 26 %). The median first delay ( delay to seek health care) among cases and controls was six and 4 h respectively. Prior history of cesarean section ( AOR 7.68 , 95 % CI , 3.11-18.96) , first delay ( AOR 2.79 , 95 % CI , 1.42-5.50) , and being referred from other health facilities ( AOR 7.47 , 95 % CI , 2.27-24.51) were independent predictors of maternal near miss. Prior history of cesarean section , being referred from other health facilities and first delay were factors associated with maternal near miss. Timely health care seeking behavior of women is uncommon in the study area. Therefore primary health care programs need to enhance the existing efforts to improve timely health care seeking behavior of women.
