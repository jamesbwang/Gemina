 There is a growing interest in usage of radiofrequency radiation ( RF) as a noninvasive brain stimulation method. Previous reported data demonstrated that RF exposure caused a change in brain oscillations. Therefore , we aimed to investigate effects of RF on brain oscillation by measuring auditory response of different brain regions in rats. Material Methods: Rats were randomly divided into three groups ( n = 12 per each group): Cage control ( C) , sham rats ( Sh) , and rats exposed to 2.1 GHz RF for 2h/day for 7 days. At the end of exposure , auditory evoked potentials ( AEPs) were recorded at different locations in rats. Latencies and amplitudes of AEPs , evoked power , inter-trial phase synchronization , and auditory evoked gamma responses were obtained in response to auditory stimulus. Furthermore , TBARS levels and 4-HNE , GFAP , iNOS and nNOS expressions were evaluated in all groups. Peak-to-peak amplitudes of AEPs were significantly higher in RF group compared with Sh group. There is no significant difference in peak latencies of AEPs between groups. Beside , evoked power , inter-trial phase synchronization , and auditory evoked gamma responses were significantly higher in RF group compared with Sh group. Also , RF group had significantly lower TBARS and 4-HNE levels than Sh group. There were no significant differences between groups for GFAP , nNOS , and iNOS levels , and between C and RF groups for all parameters. Our present findings suggest that short-term RF treatment under chosen experimental conditions have statistically significant effect on neuronal networks of rats by probably reducing oxidative damage. However , this effect must be further studied for possible noninvasive brain stimulation.
