 Many challenges in biosensing originate from the fact that the all-important nanoarchitecture of the biosensor surface , including precise density and orientation of bioreceptors , is not entirely comprehended. Here , we introduced a three-dimensional DNA origami as a bioreceptor carrier to functionalize the fiber optic surface plasmon resonance ( FO-SPR) sensor with nanoscale precision. Starting from a 24-helix bundle , two distinct DNA origami structures were designed to position thrombin-specific aptamers with different densities and distances ( 27 and 113 nm) from the FO-SPR surface. The origami-based biosensors not only proved to be capable of reproducible , label-free thrombin detection but revealed also valuable innovative features: ( 1) a significantly better performance in the absence of backfilling , known as essential in the biosensing field , suggesting improved bioreceptor orientation and accessibility , and ( 2) a wider linear range compared to previously reported thrombin biosensors. We envisage that our method will be beneficial for both scientists and clinicians looking for new surface ( bio) chemistry and improved diagnostics.
