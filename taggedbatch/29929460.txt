 High prediction accuracy of flexible loops in different protein families is a challenge because of the crucial functions associated with these regions. Results of the currently available programs for prediction of loops vary from protein to protein. For prediction of flexible regions in the G-domain for 23 representatives of G-proteins with the known 3D structure we have used eight programs. The results of predictions demonstrate that the FoldUnfold program predicts better loop positions than the PONDR , RÐžNN , DisEMBL , IUPred , GlobPlot 2 , FoldIndex , and MobiDB programs. When classifying the predicted loops ( rigid/flexible) according to the Debye-Waller fluctuation factors , our data reveal the existing weak correlation between the B-factors and the average number of closed residues according to the FoldUnfold program; the percentage of overlapping characteristics ( residue fold/unfold status) of the protein residues from the two methods is about 60-70 %. According to the FoldUnfold program , for G-proteins with the posttranslational modifications , the surrounding binding site residues by disordered-promoting glycine and alanine residues conduces to a more flexible position of the binding sites for fatty acid , while methionine , cysteine and isoleucine residues provide more rigid binding sites. Thus , our research demonstrates additional possibilities of the FoldUnfold program for prediction of flexible regions and characteristics of individual residues in a different protein family.
