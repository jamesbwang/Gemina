 Retinal vasculitis ( RV) is an inflammation<symptom> of retinal blood vessels that can be associated with uveitis or be isolated , and can induce vascular occlusion and retinal ischemia. Visual acuity can be severely affected in case of macular involvement or neovessel formation. The diagnosis relies on fundoscopy and fluorescein angiography. Systemic<disease> diseases<disease> may be associated with RV , the most frequently encountered are Beh√ßet 's disease , sarcoidosis or multiple sclerosis , all predominantly associated with venous involvement , whereas systemic lupus erythematosus and necrotizing vasculitis are less frequently observed and predominantly associated with arterial or mixed vasculitis. Treatments are usually aggressive in order to preserve a good visual acuity and to reduce retinal inflammation<symptom> and chronic ischemia. Steroids , immunosuppressive drugs , retinal laser photocoagulation , intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are usual treatments and more recently , anti-TNFalpha monoclonal therapeutic antibodies have been shown to be very successful.
