 This review reports the principal solutions proposed in the literature to reduce the complexity of the control and of the design of robotic hands taking inspiration from the organization of the human brain. Several studies in neuroscience concerning the sensorimotor organization of the human hand proved that , despite the complexity of the hand , a few parameters can describe most of the variance in the patterns of configurations and movements. In other words , humans exploit a reduced set of parameters , known in the literature as synergies , to control their hands. In robotics , this dimensionality reduction can be achieved by coupling some of the degrees of freedom ( DoFs) of the robotic hand , that results in a reduction of the needed inputs. Such coupling can be obtained at the software level , exploiting mapping algorithm to reproduce human hand organization , and at the hardware level , through either rigid or compliant physical couplings between the joints of the robotic hand. This paper reviews the main solutions proposed for both the approaches.
