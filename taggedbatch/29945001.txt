 Craniopharyngiomas ( CPs) and their treatment are associated with hypothalamic damage that causes hypothalamic obesity ( HO) in 30 % -70 % of cases. Thus , there is ongoing research regarding tangible solutions for HO , because these patients have unrelenting resistance to basic weight-loss interventions. This review aims to summarize the interventions that are used to treat CP-related HO ( CP-HO) , including pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery. The Cochrane Library , EMBASE , and PubMed databases were searched up to June 2017 for relevant reports. Two reviewers conducted independent evaluations of the studies identified. Eighteen articles were included in the systematic review , with 3 reports describing pharmacotherapy in randomized controlled trials and 15 reports describing bariatric surgery. Although several studies described effective interventions for treating CP-HO , the evidence base was limited by its low quality and our inability to perform a meta-analysis , which was related to a lack of adequate or integrated data. Octreotide appears to be a preferred treatment for patients with CP-HO , based on limited data. Gastric bypass surgery may also be suitable for select patients with CP-HO , based on a review of various procedures in this setting. Microsurgical preservation of the hypothalamic structures is mandatory to decrease CP-HO-related morbidity and mortality. Further studies with adequate analytical power and sufficient follow-up are needed to identify effective strategies for CP-HO treatment.
