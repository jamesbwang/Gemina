 Every cell in an individual has largely the same genomic sequence and yet cells in different tissues can present widely different phenotypes. This variation arises because each cell expresses a specific subset of genomic instructions. Control over which instructions , or genes , are expressed is largely controlled by transcriptional regulatory pathways. Each cell must assimilate a huge amount of environmental input , and thus it is of no surprise that transcription is regulated by many intertwining mechanisms. This large regulatory landscape means there are ample possibilities for problems to arise , which in a medical context means the development of disease states. Metabolism within the cell , and more broadly , affects and is affected by transcriptional regulation. Metabolism can therefore contribute to improper transcriptional programming , or pathogenic metabolism can be the result of transcriptional dysregulation. Here , we discuss the established and emerging mechanisms for controling transcription and how they affect metabolism in the context of pathogenesis. Cis- and trans-regulatory elements , microRNA and epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA and histone methylation , all have input into what genes are transcribed. Each has also been implicated in diseases such as metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> , various forms of diabetes , and cancer. In this review , we discuss the current understanding of these areas and highlight some natural models that may inspire future therapeutics.
