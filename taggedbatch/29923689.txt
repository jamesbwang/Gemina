 A variety of 5- ( 2H-tetrazol-5-yl) -4-thioxo-2- ( substituted phenyl) -4,5-dihydro-1,3-oxazin-6-ones ( 3a-k) have been synthesized from 1,3-oxazine-5-carbonitriles ( 2a-k). The protocol represents an efficient , facile and novel route from easily available precursors to unprecedented structures that share 1,3-oxazine and tetrazole motifs of utmost value. All the synthesized compounds ( 3a-k) were evaluated for their inhibitory potential against mushroom tyrosinase. Results revealed that all examined 1,3-oxazine-tetrazole hybrids exhibited significant tyrosinase inhibitory activity while compound 3d having 2-bromophenyl moiety was the most potent among the series with IC
