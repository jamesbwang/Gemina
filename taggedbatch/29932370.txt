 OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate long-term seizure<symptom> outcome , rate of reoperation , and postoperative neuropsychological performance following selective amygdalohippocampectomy ( SelAH) or anterior temporal lobectomy ( ATL) in pediatric patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE). METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of cases of medically refractory pediatric TLE treated initially with either SelAH or ATL. Standardized pre- and postoperative evaluation included seizure<symptom> charting , surface and long-term video-electroencephalography , 1.5-T MRI , and neuropsychological testing. RESULTS A total of 79 patients treated initially with SelAH ( n = 18) or ATL ( n = 61) were included in this study , with a mean follow-up of 5.3 ± 4 years ( range 1-16 years). The patients ' average age at initial surgery was 10.6 ± 5 years , with an average surgical delay of 5.7 ± 4 years between seizure<symptom> onset and surgery. Seizure<symptom> freedom ( Engel I) following the initial operation was significantly more likely following ATL ( 47/61 , 77 %) than SelAH ( 8/18 , 44 %; p = 0.017 , Fisher 's exact test). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients with postoperative neuropsychological deficits following SelAH ( 8/18 , 44 %) or ATL ( 21/61 , 34 %). However , reoperation was significantly more likely following SelAH ( 8/18 , 44 %) than after ATL ( 7/61 , 11 %; p = 0.004) and was more likely to result in Engel I outcome for ATL after failed SelAH ( 7/8 , 88 %) than for posterior extension after failed ATL ( 1/7 , 14 %; p = 0.01). Reoperation was well tolerated without significant neuropsychological deterioration. Ultimately , including 15 reoperations , 58 of 79 ( 73 %) patients were free from disabling seizures<symptom> at the most recent follow-up. CONCLUSIONS SelAH among pediatric patients with medically refractory unilateral TLE yields significantly worse rates of seizure<symptom> control compared with ATL. Reoperation is significantly more likely following SelAH , is not associated with incremental neuropsychological deterioration , and frequently results in freedom from disabling seizures<symptom>. These results are significant in that they argue against using SelAH for pediatric TLE surgery.
