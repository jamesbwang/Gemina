 The objective of the study is to determine the usefulness of the SOFA ( Sequential Organ<symptom> Failure<symptom> Assessment) , quick SOFA ( qSOFA) , LODS ( Logistic Organ Dysfunction System) and EWS ( Early Warning Score) scores to predict in-hospital mortality among septic patients attended in the emergency department; to evaluate what factors are associated with mortality; and develop a predictive model of in-hospital mortality. Retrospective study including patients over 14 years of age included in the sepsis<disease> code of an Emergency Department of a University Hospital between November 2013 and September 2015. Demographic variables , hemodynamic and analytical variables , and in-hospital mortality were collected to obtain qSOFA , SOFA , LODS , EWS scores. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for each score. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the probability of in-hospital mortality. A total of 349 patients were analyzed , median age 72.7 ( range 86) , males: 54.4 %. The in-hospital mortality was 21.8 %. AUC obtained: LODS: 0.73 ( IC 95 % 0.67-0.80; p < 0.001) , EWS: 0.73 ( IC 95 % 0.65-0.81; p < 0.001) , SOFA: 0.72 ( IC 95 % 0.65- 0.78; p < 0.001) , qSOFA: 0.67 ( IC 95 % 0.58-0.76; p < 0.001). After the multivariate analysis , these were the independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality: Oxygen saturation ≤ 92 % , Glasgow coma<symptom> score < 14 , lactate ≥ 2mmol/L ( p < 0.05). Two prognostic models were generated: MPRO1: age , oxygen saturation ≤ 92 % and Glasgow coma<symptom> score < 14 , AUC: 0.78 ( IC 95 % 0.72-0.84; p < 0.001) and MPRO2 formed by the previous ones and lactate ≥ 2mmol/L , AUC: 0.82 ( IC 95 % 0.76-0.87; p < 0.001). SOFA score and the new developed scores could be useful in asses the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients included in the sepsis<disease> code.
