 Elevated cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2) closely associates with tumor progression and distant metastasis in various<disease> human cancers. However , the role of COX-2 in epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC) , and its mechanistic details , remain poorly understood. In the present study , we tested hypothesis that COX-2 induces loss of expression of E-cadherin , with resulting promotion of cancer cells ' invasiveness in ovarian cancer. First , we observed an inverse relationship between COX-2 and E-cadherin expression as COX-2 was enhanced but E-cadherin was decreased in surgically-resected specimens of EOC. Depletion of COX-2 , by celecoxib treatment , resulted in attenuated nuclear translocation of Snail , and , in turn , significantly increased E-cadherin in EOC cell line SKOV3 , which was established to be due to the reduced binding of Snail onto E-cadherin promoter. Such COX-2 inhibition resulted in reduced invasion of EOC cells , similar to what was achieved through Snail silencing in SKOV as well as ES-2 EOC cells. These results suggest that COX-2-Snail signaling plays a critical role in regulation of E-cadherin and might provide insights into mechanisms for paracrine inflammation-mediated aggressiveness in EOC.
