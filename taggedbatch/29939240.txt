 The mealybug Planococcus ficus ( Signoret) ( Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) has recently been detected in vineyards in southern Brazil. The ant Linepithema micans ( Forel) ( Hymenoptera: Formicidae) is the most abundant and frequent species in these vineyards , acting mainly as a disperser of the native soil scale , the ground pearl Eurhizococcus brasiliensis<pathogen> ( Wille) ( Hemiptera: Margarodidae). This study evaluated the interactions ( dispersal and predation) of L. micans with P. ficus. The first experiment evaluated the interaction between L. micans and P. ficus in a greenhouse , using Paulsen 1103 rootstock ( Vitis berlandieri × Vitis rupestris) planted in pots. Plants were infested by 1) adult females of P. ficus , and 2) adult females of P. ficus and L. micans , and all mealybugs remaining after the experimental period were counted. To evaluate P. ficus predation by L. micans , two laboratory experiments were conducted ( 25 °C , 80 % relative humidity). In the first experiment , sprouted potatoes were infested with ovisacs , first-instar nymphs and adult females of P. ficus and evaluated in three treatments: 1) L. micans fed with carbohydrate and protein , 2) L. micans without food , and 3) without ants present. In the second , potatoes were infested only with first-instar nymphs of P. ficus and were exposed in two treatments: 1) L. micans without food , and 2) without ants present. The results were evaluated by counting the remaining mealybugs , with and without ants. The results showed that L. micans does not transport P. ficus , and predates on first-instar nymphs of the mealybug.
