 The rational design of concentration-gradient ( CG) structure is demonstrated as an available approach to improve the electrochemical performances of high-energy nickel-rich cathodes for lithium-ion batteries ( LIBs). However , the complicated preparing processes , especially the CG-precursors , generally result in the less-than-ideal repeatability and consistency that is regarded as an extreme challenge for the widespread commercialization. Thus , the innovative strategy with facile steps and the feasibility of large-scale preparation for commercialized applications should be urgently developed. Herein , through the temperature-tunable cation diffusion , the feasibility of controllable preparation of nickel-rich CG-LiNi
