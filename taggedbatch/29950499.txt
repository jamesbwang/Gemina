 A 25-year-old male patient presented with complaints of blurred vision in both eyes since 2 years. The patient was a known case of nephrotic syndrome<disease><symptom> with dyslipidaemia for which he was on diuretics and lipid-lowering agents for 3 years. On examination , his visual acuity was 6/9 in both eyes with cloudy<symptom> cornea and arcus juvenilis. Fundus examination was within normal limits. On systemic work-up , his lipid profile was deranged with increased serum total cholesterol , very low density lipoprotein , low density lipoprotein and triglyceride. The serum high density lipoprotein was decreased. Renal function test revealed elevated serum creatinine with significant proteinuria<symptom>. Renal biopsy was suggestive of dense deposit disease on immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. Ocular manifestation of dense deposit disease is characterised by retinal drusen , pigmentary atrophy , choroidal neovascular membrane and atypical serous retinopathy. To the best of our knowledge , anterior segment changes in dense deposit disease has not been reported. This is the first case reporting cloudy<symptom> cornea with arcus juvenilis in a case of dense deposit disease.
