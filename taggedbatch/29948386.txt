 We investigated early tumor shrinkage ( ETS) and depth of response ( DpR) using data from the G-SOX study comparing S-1 plus oxaliplatin with S-1 plus cisplatin as the first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer ( AGC). ETS was determined as % decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions<symptom> at the first evaluation of week 6 compared to baseline. DpR was the maximum % shrinkage during the study treatment. The impact of ETS ( cutoff value 20 %) and DpR ( continuous value) on progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) were assessed by the log-rank test and Cox regression analysis including prognostic factors obtained in the G-SOX study; ECOG performance status , baseline sum of tumor diameters , disease status ( recurrent/unresectable) , and histology ( diffuse/intestinal). Among 685 patients enrolled in the G-SOX study , 632 patients who had the first tumor evaluation were analyzed. Patients with ETS ≥ 20 % had longer PFS ( median 4.5 vs. 2.8 months , p < 0.0001) and OS ( median 14.8 vs. 10.5 months , p < 0.0001) than those with ETS < 20 %. Adjusted hazard ratios of ETS < 20 vs. ≥ 20 % were 0.606 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.506-0.725) for PFS and 0.589 ( 95 % CI 0.492-0.704) for OS. DpR was also significantly associated with PFS and OS ( both p < 0.0001). These results were similar between the SOX and CS groups. In AGC patients receiving the first-line therapy , ETS and DpR might be predictors for PFS and OS.
