 This study aimed to establish consensus on the expression and distinction of disordered eating in pregnancy to improve awareness across various health professions and inform the development of a pregnancy-specific assessment instrument. A three-round modified Delphi method was used with two independent panels. International clinicians and researchers with extensive knowledge on and/or clinical experience with eating disorders formed the first panel and were recruited using structured selection criteria. Women who identified with a lived experience of disordered eating in pregnancy formed the second panel and were recruited via expressions of interest from study advertising on pregnancy forums and social media platforms. A systematic search of academic and grey literature produced 200 sources which were used to pre-populate the Round I questionnaire. Additional items were included in Round II based on panel feedback in Round I. Consensus was defined as 75 % agreement on an item. Of the 102 items presented to the 26 professional panel members and 15 consumer panel members , 75 reached consensus across both panels. Both panels clearly identified signs and symptoms of disordered eating in pregnancy and endorsed a number of clinical features practitioners should consider when delineating disordered eating symptomatically from normative pregnancy experiences. A list of signs and symptoms in consensus was identified. The areas of collective agreement may be used to guide clinicians in clinical practice , aid the development of psychometric tools to detect/assess pregnancy-specific disordered eating , in addition to serving as starting point for the development of a core outcome set to measure disordered eating in pregnancy.
