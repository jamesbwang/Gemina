 Highly porous carbonaceous nonprecious metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction are prepared by carbonization of low-cost metalloporphyrin-based hypercrosslinked polymers ( MPH-X). With high surface area ( 2768 m2 g-1) , hierarchical porous structure and high metal loading ( 9.97 wt %) , the obtained hyperporous carbon MPH-Fe/C catalyst exhibits high oxygen reduction reaction ( ORR) activity with a half-wave potential ( 0.816 V) that is comparable to the 0.819 V of commercial Pt/C. Stability tests reveal that MPH-Fe/C also exhibits outstanding long-term durability and methanol-tolerance. Our findings may offer an alternative approach to produce nonprecious metal ORR catalysts in large-scale due to the low-cost MPH-X precursors with diverse metal types.
