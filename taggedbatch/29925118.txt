 The study examines employment prospects of persons who participate in further and re-training measures in the context of vocational rehabilitation in the responsibility of the Federal Employment Agency ( FEA). Using administrative data of the FEA ( RehaPro) , we focus on persons completing vocational rehabilitation between 2009 and 2012 ( N = 21,772). We employ event history analysis to present time and extent of employment transition and their sustainability. By using multivariate analyses , factors for taking up employment are identified. Within 500 days , 70 % of promoted persons gain contributed employment , often directly after rehabilitation. The median for employment duration within the observation period is 670 days. Further training measures are an important opportunity for the re-integration of persons with health limitations in the labour market.
