 Ordered mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon ( OMNC) materials are considered as the most promising material for supercapacitors. In this study , a highly ordered two-dimensional ( 2D) hexagonal mesostructured polymer was synthesized through a facile assembly of triblock polymer micelles and phenol-melamine/formaldehyde resin via an organic-organic assembly process in aqueous solution. After calcination , the novel OMNC materials with 2D hexagonal mesostructures were obtained. By further KOH activation , the surface area and the porosity of the OMNC significantly improved , and the internal mesoporous structures were maintained. The activated OMNC-800A displayed a specific capacitance as high as 475.75 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 with an outstanding cycling stability ( over 100 % capacitance retention during 2000 cycling tests at 100 mV s-1). These results confirm that the tubular mesochannels inside the OMNC are very beneficial in providing an accessible path for diffusion of the electrolyte , thereby improving the specific capacitance of OMNC at a high current density.
