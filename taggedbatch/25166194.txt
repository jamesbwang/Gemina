 Andreev bound states are ubiquitous in superconducting hybrid structures. They are formed near impurities , in Josephson junctions , in vortex cores and at interfaces. At spin-active superconductor-ferromagnet interfaces , Andreev bound states are formed due to spin-dependent scattering phases. Spin-dependent phase shifts are an important ingredient for the generation of triplet Cooper pairs in superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures. Spectroscopy of Andreev bound states is a powerful probe of superconducting order parameter symmetry , as well as spin-dependent interface scattering and the triplet proximity effect.This article is part of the theme issue ` Andreev bound states '.
