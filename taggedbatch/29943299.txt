 Single cell technology has enormously changed the landscape of biomedical science , including single cell omics , gene editing , single cell imaging , single cell ( embryo) manipulate , or non-invasive micro-test. Single cell technology also leads the research area of early embryo from basic research to reproductive medical application. We got the knowledge of programming/reprogramming and the epigenetics dynamics in the cell lineage differentiation. In the reproductive medicine , the genomic sequencing of embryo or polar body and the preimplantation genetic diagnosis rely on the single cell techniques. Those discoveries will improve the assisted reproductive technologies , human health , and livestock husbandry. In the future , the comprehensive atlas of cell state and lineage information can be generated for cellular systems by single-cell multi-omics approaches.
