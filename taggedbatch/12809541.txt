 This study was conducted to investigate the heat stress and semen quality among male workers in a steel industry in Iran and investigate the relationship between heat stress indices and semen parameters. The study was conducted on workers exposed ( Time-weighted averages of WBGT and PHS ( 35.76 Â°C and 491.56 w/m Semen parameters of the studied workers exposed to heat were in the borderline level of normozoospermic range , and their semen parameters were significantly lower than controls. For better assessment of occupational environment concerning physiological and semen parameters in steel industries , WBGT can be a more useful index.
