 The detection and adsorption of nitroaromatic compounds such as 2,4-dinitrotoluene ( DNT) is of great importance , but the selective detection of trace DNT in water remains a challenge. Here , we report molecularly imprinted polymer ( MIP) nanofibers fabricated by electrospinning using DNT as a template molecule and poly ( allylamine) as a functional macromer. The physical and chemical properties of the nanofibers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR) spectroscopy , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) , and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , and the DNT adsorption and selectivity properties were also studied by high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC). The results show that the nanofibers prepared using 20 wt % poly ( ethylene terephthalate) ( PET) in solvent had a good morphology and an optimal ratio of poly ( allylamine) and DNT , and the imprinted nanofibers showed specific adsorption of DNT , in accordance with the Freundlich isotherm model and Scatchard analysis. Furthermore , the imprinted nanofibers showed remarkable stability and reusability , losing only 3 % of their performance after eight cycles. Thus , the imprinted nanofibers fabricated by this strategy could be used for trace DNT extraction , separation , and further construction of sensors in the near future.
