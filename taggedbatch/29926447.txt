 Triplex DNA is becoming a very useful domain to design pH-triggered DNA nanoswitches and nanodevices. The high versatility and programmability of triplex DNA interactions allows the integration of pH-controllable modules into DNA-based reactions and self-assembly processes. Here , we describe the procedure to characterize DNA-based triplex nanoswitches and more in general pH-triggered structure-switching mechanisms. Procedures to characterize pH-triggered DNA nanodevices will be useful for many applications in the field of biosensing , drug delivery systems and smart nanomaterials.
