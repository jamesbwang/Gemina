 For the first time here , we report a colloid crystal capable of undergoing transition among three states in response to external stimuli. The colloidal crystal was assembled from poly ( N-isopropylacrylamide) ( PNIPAM) microgel and doped with poly ( N-isopropylacrylamide- co-2-acrylamido-phenylboronic acid) ( P ( NIPAM-2-AAPBA)) microgel. The ordered structure was locked by in situ photopolymerization. Taking advantage of the different responses of the two microgels to external stimuli , defect state can be induced and erased reversibly. Particularly , because the dopant , that is , P ( NIPAM-2-AAPBA) microgel sphere , shrinks with increasing glucose concentration , its size changes from larger than the host , that is , PNIPAM microgel sphere , to equal to the host , and finally smaller than the host. Therefore , upon addition of glucose , the crystal undergoes transition from a state with acceptor-type defect , to no defect state , and then to a state with donor-type defect. The transition among the three states is fully reversible. In addition , the response of the doped crystal to glucose is relatively fast.
