 Traction achieved using an intraoperative femoral fracture reduction device ( IFFRD) was compared with that observed using a traction table ( TT) for closed reduction of trochanteric fractures and cephalomedullary nail fixation. Prospective cohort study. Level 1 trauma center. One hundred forty-one eligible patients with 141 fractures ( Orthopaedic Trauma Association type 31-A1 , n = 28; A2 , n = 75; and A3 , n = 38 cases) were randomized to the IFFRD ( n = 73) or TT ( n = 68) group. The IFFRD was used while the patient was placed on a normal radiolucent operation table with 25-30 degrees elevation of the injured side to allow for antero-posterior and lateral fluoroscopic examination and facilitate entry-point guide wire insertion. Patient demographics , operative and fluoroscopy duration , quality of fracture reduction , and radiological bone union time were recorded. Patient demographics were similar between groups. Duration of patient positioning was longer in the TT group ( P < 0.05); duration of fluoroscopy , fracture reduction , and time to union were comparable. An IFFRD used with a normal radiolucent operation table decreased patient positioning time , with efficacy comparable to the TT approach for closed reduction of trochanteric fractures.
