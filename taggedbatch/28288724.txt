 Prevention of alveolar bone resorption after tooth extraction may be useful for implant rehabilitation of the edentulous site minimizing the future need for bone augmentation procedures. A number of studies have investigated the efficacy of autologous platelet concentrates for the preservation of the alveolar bone volume after tooth extraction. Although encouraging results have been published , the available data are still controversial. The aim of the present systematic review was to assess the effect of platelet concentrates on alveolar socket preservation after tooth extraction. A literature search was carried out up to September 2017 for prospective controlled trials in which a test group using exclusively a platelet concentrate was compared with a control group in which extraction sockets were left to heal spontaneously. Seven controlled clinical trials published between 2010 and 2016 were included. A total of 320 extractions ( 170 tests and 150 controls) in 190 patients was considered. A great heterogeneity was found in terms of study design , methodological aspects , and outcome evaluation. For this reason , a quantitative analysis followed by meta-analysis was not possible , and only a descriptive analysis on the role of platelet concentrates in alveolar socket preservation was carried out. There is growing evidence that platelet concentrates may be advantageously used in postextraction sites , mainly to improve soft<disease> tissue healing and to reduce postoperative symptoms. Data about their potential in preserving the alveolar bone volume are still scarce and controversial , although recently encouraging results have been presented using more reliable and accurate evaluation technologies , such as the computed tomography. Further , well-designed and methodologically standardized investigations are strongly demanded to reach a higher level of evidence on this topic.
