 Structural characterization of intrinsically disordered proteins ( IDPs) has been a major challenge in the field of protein science due to limited capabilities to obtain full-length high-resolution structures. Native ESI-MS with top-down MS was utilized to obtain structural features of protein-ligand binding for the Parkinson 's disease-related protein , α-synuclein ( αSyn) , which is natively unstructured. Binding of heavy metals has been implicated in the accelerated formation of αSyn aggregation. Using high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance ( FT-ICR) mass spectrometry , native top-down MS with various fragmentation methods , including electron capture dissociation ( ECD) , collisional activated dissociation ( CAD) , and multistage tandem MS ( MS
