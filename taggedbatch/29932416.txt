 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the bioequivalence in the pharmacokinetics of two 2-mg tulobuterol transdermal delivery systems ( TDSs) in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetic ( PK) analysis was performed using data from a randomized , open-label , single-dose , two-way , two-period , crossover study. Eligible subjects received either the Bretol 速 patch ( test drug) or Hokunalin 速 patch ( reference drug) in sequence according to their allocated group. Serial blood samples for PK analyses were collected for up to 48 hours after tulobuterol TDS application. The PK parameters , including the maximum concentration ( Cmax) and area under the curve from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration time ( AUClast) , were estimated by using noncompartmental analysis. The geometric mean ratios ( GMRs) of the Cmax and AUClast and their 90 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were estimated. A total of 27 subjects completed the study as planned. The concentration-time profiles of tulobuterol were similar in both formulations. The GMRs ( 90 % CIs) of Cmax and AUClast were 0.9443 ( 0.8790- 1.0144) and 0.9600 ( 0.8660- 1.0642) , respectively. The PK profiles of both tulobuterol TDSs were comparable. In addition , the 90 % CIs of the GMR were within the bioequivalence criteria of 0.800- 1.250. Therefore , the Bretol 速 patch can be used as an alternative to the Hokunalin 速 patch for the treatment of patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease..
