 The combination of low-dose local anesthesia and lipophilic opioids such as fentanyl is established as a standard solution for labor epidural analgesia. Fentanyl increases efficacy , but may have negative effects on the neonate in terms of reduced neonatal neurologic and adaptive capacity scores and breast feeding. We hypothesized that addition of adrenaline 2 μg/mL to a solution of bupivacaine 1 mg/mL and fentanyl 2 μg/mL would reduce the systemic uptake of fentanyl , resulting in reduced serum fentanyl in the fetus at birth. Forty-one nulliparous women requesting epidural analgesia were randomized to epidural analgesia with or without adrenaline. Blood samples were drawn from the mother with regular intervals , and at delivery. An umbilical vein blood sample ( used as a proxy for fetal exposure) was drawn after clamping. There were no significant differences between the groups in fentanyl concentrations in the umbilical vein and maternal serum at birth. There was a significantly lower mean area under the maternal serum-concentration curve for the first 2 hours of treatment in the adrenaline group ( mean difference 0.161 nmol h/L ( 0.034; 0.289) , P = .015) , implying slower systemic uptake in the adrenaline group initially. There were no significant differences in treatment duration , motor block , Apgar scores , umbilical pH and base excess , or mode of delivery. The addition of adrenaline to an epidural solution containing fentanyl lowered maternal systemic serum fentanyl concentration during the first 2 hours , but did not lower serum fentanyl concentration in the umbilical vein and mother at delivery.
