 High ion conductivity of anion-exchange membrane is essential for the operation of alkaline anion-exchange membrane fuel cell. In this work , we demonstrated an effective strategy to enhance the conductivity of anion-exchange membrane ( AEM) , by incorporation of quaternized cellulose nanocrystal ( QCNC) for the first time. Morphology observation demonstrated a uniform distribution of QCNC within QPPO matrix , as well as a clear QCNC network , which led to significant enhancement in hydroxide conductivities of composite membranes<symptom> , for example , 2 wt % QCNC/QPPO membrane possessed a conductivity of 160 % ( 60 mS cm
