 Multilayer WSe2 with a larger optical density of states and absorbance is regarded as a better candidate than its monolayer counterpart for next generation optoelectronic devices , however insight into carrier dynamics is still lacking. Herein , we experimentally observed an anomalous PL quenching with decreasing temperature for multilayer WSe2. At a low temperature ( 77 K) , the Auger processes govern carrier recombination in multilayer WSe2 , which are induced by a phonon bottleneck effect and strong photon absorption , and lead to PL quenching. From transient absorption spectroscopy , two distinct Auger processes are observed: a fast one ( 1-2 ps) and a slow one ( > 190 ps) , which are caused by two different deep midgap defect-levels in WSe2. Based on the Auger recombination model , these two Auger rates are quantitatively estimated at ∼ 6.69 ( ± 0.05) × 10-2 and 1.22 ( ± 0.04) × 10-3 cm2 s-1 , respectively. Our current observations provide an important supplement for optimizing the optical and electric behaviors in multilayer WSe2 based devices.
