 The influenza<pathogen><disease> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( IAV<pathogen>) is a constant threat for humans worldwide. The understanding of motif-domain protein participation is essential to combat the pathogen. In this study , a data mining approach was employed to extract influenza-human Protein-Protein interactions ( PPI) from VirusMentha , Virus MINT , IntAct , and Pfam databases , to mine motif-domain interactions ( MDIs) stored as Regular Expressions ( RegExp) in 3DID database. A total of 107 RegExp related to human MDIs were searched on 51,242 protein fragments from H1N1<pathogen> , H1N2<pathogen> , H2N2<pathogen> , H3N2<pathogen> and H5N1<pathogen> strains obtained from Virus Variation database. A total 46 MDIs were frequently mapped on the IAV<pathogen> proteins and shared between the different strains. IAV<pathogen> kept host-like MDIs that were associated with the virus survival , which could be related to essential biological process such as microtubule-based processes , regulation of cell cycle check point , regulation of replication and transcription of DNA , etc. in human cells. The amino acid motifs were searched for matches in the immune epitope database and it was found that some motifs are part of experimentally determined epitopes on IAV<pathogen> , implying that such interactions exist. The directed data-mining method employed could be used to identify functional motifs in other viruses for envisioning new therapies.
