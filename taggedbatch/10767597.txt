 Schistosomiasis affects million people and its control is widely dependent on a single drug , praziquantel. Computational chemistry has led to the development of new tools that predict molecular properties related to pharmacological potential. We conducted a theoretical study of the imizadole alkaloids of Pilocarpus microphyllus ( Rutaceae) with schistosomicidal properties. The molecules of epiisopiloturine , epiisopilosine , isopilosine , pilosine , and macaubine were evaluated using theory models ( B3lyp/SDD , B3lyp/6 -31 + G ( d , p) , B3lyp/6 -311 + + G ( d , p)). Absorption , distribution , metabolization , excretion , and toxicity ( ADMET) predictions were used to determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the alkaloids. After optimization , the molecules were submitted to molecular docking calculations with the purine nucleoside phosphorylase , thioredoxin glutathione reductase , methylthioadenosine phosphorylase , arginase , uridine phosphorylase , Cathepsin B1 and histone deacetylase 8 enzymes , which are possible targets of Schistosoma mansoni. The results showed that B3lyp/6 -311 + + G ( d , p) was the optimal model to describe the properties studied. Thermodynamic analysis showed that epiisopiloturine and epiisopilosine were the most stable isomers; however , the epiisopilosine ligand achieved a superior interaction with the enzymes studied in the molecular docking experiments , which corroborated the results of previous experimental studies on schistosomiasis.
