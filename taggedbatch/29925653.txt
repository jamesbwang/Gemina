 Poliovirus<pathogen> eradication initiative spawned global immunization infrastructure and dramatically decreased the disease , yet the original virus eradication goal has not been met. The suboptimal properties of the existing vaccines are among the major reasons why the program repeatedly missed eradication deadlines. Oral live poliovirus<pathogen> vaccine ( OPV) , while affordable and effective , occasionally causes the disease in the primary recipients , and the attenuated viruses rapidly regain virulence and can cause poliomyelitis<disease> outbreaks. Inactivated poliovirus<pathogen> vaccine ( IPV) is safe , but expensive , and does not induce mucosal immunity necessary to interrupt the virus transmission. While the need for a better vaccine is widely recognized , the current efforts are largely focused on improvements of OPV or IPV still beset by the fundamental drawbacks of the original products. Here we demonstrate a different design of anti-poliovirus vaccine based on
