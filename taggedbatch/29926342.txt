 Our aim of this research was to determine the value of SPECT/CT with We retrospectively analyzed 184 patients who performed In group 1 , 95/140 ( 67.9 %) patients were confirmed as neuroendocrine neoplasms including 85 neuroendocrine tumors and 10 neuroendocrine carcinomas. Patient-based analysis showed that the sensitivity , specificity and accuracy of diagnosing neuroendocrine neoplasms with SPECT/CT were 81.1 , 84.4 and 82.1 %. There was significant difference of TBRs among G1 , G2 and G3 ( F = 3.175 , P = 0.048). In group 2 , 22/44 ( 50.0 %) patients occurred metastasis mainly in liver. The sensitivity , specificity and accuracy of monitoring recurrence were 87.0 , 100 and 93.2 %. None
