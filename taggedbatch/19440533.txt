 Surgery has the potential to address one of the largest , neglected burdens of disease in low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs) , especially in sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA). The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery ( LCoGS) has provided a blueprint for a systems approach to making safe emergency and elective surgery accessible and affordable and has started to enable African governments to develop national surgical plans. This editorial outlines an important gap , which is the need for surgical systems research , especially at district hospitals which are the first point of surgical care for rural communities , to inform the implementation of country plans. Using the Lancet Commission as a starting point and illustrated by two European Union ( EU) funded research projects , we point to the need for implementation research to develop and evaluate contextualised strategies. As illustrated by the case study of Zambia , coordination by global and external stakeholders can enable governments to lead national scale-up of essential surgery , supported by national partners including surgical specialist associations.
