 DNA biosensors could overcome some of the common drawbacks of lab-based techniques for nucleic acids detection for diagnostics purposes. One of the main impediments for such applications of DNA biosensors is their lack of sensitivity: this can prevent their full exploitation in the diagnostic analytical field. DNA nanotechnology could enhance DNA biosensors and let them perform at the required high sensitivity. Well-designed , programmable self-assembly reactions can be triggered by a specific nucleic acid target. The Hybridization Chain Reaction ( HCR) is a self-assembly strategy in which the target nucleic acid sequence triggers the formation of long nicked double-stranded DNA nanostructures. This can be performed in solution or on a surface , and the process can be coupled to different signal transduction schemes. We here describe the methods to design and test HCR reactions for the detection of different nucleic acid targets in solution and the procedures to exploit this strategy on surfaces with an electrochemical biosensing platform.
