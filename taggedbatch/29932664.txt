 Single-photon emitters play an essential role in quantum technologies , including quantum computing and quantum communications. Atomic defects in hexagonal boron nitride ( h-BN) have recently emerged as new room-temperature single-photon emitters in solid-state systems , but the development of scalable and tunable h-BN single-photon emitters requires external methods that can control the emission energy of individual defects. Here , by fabricating van der Waals heterostructures of h-BN and graphene , we demonstrate the electrical control of single-photon emission from atomic defects in h-BN via the Stark effect. By applying an out-of-plane electric field through graphene gates , we observed Stark shifts as large as 5.4 nm per GV/m. The Stark shift generated upon a vertical electric field suggests the existence of out-of-plane dipole moments associated with atomic defect emitters , which is supported by first-principles theoretical calculations. Furthermore , we found field-induced discrete modification and stabilization of emission intensity , which were reversibly controllable with an external electric field.
