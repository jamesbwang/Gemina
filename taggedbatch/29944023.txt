 Colon biopsies are among the most frequently examined specimens by pathologists. Many pathology practices , ours included , review upfront levels on all gastrointestinal biopsies. In our experience , when a lesion<symptom> is present on specimens labeled `` colon polyp , '' it is readily identified on the first level. To test our hypothesis , we re-reviewed 500 cases in which a lesion<symptom> was identified histologically and determined if the diagnosis could be made on the first level. Furthermore , we examined 50 additional cases of high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma to determine if the higher-grade component was also present on the first level. Cases were retrieved for lesions<symptom> that could account for a colon polyp clinically , and the first level was examined to determine if lesional tissue was present on the first level. Fifty additional cases of higher-grade lesions<symptom> were included to ensure higher-grade lesions<symptom> were present on the first level. Overall , 497/500 ( 99.4 %) of the non-high-grade lesions<symptom> were present on the first level , whereas 3/500 ( 0.6 %) required the additional level for diagnosis. All 50 high-grade lesions<symptom> were present on the first level examined. Many pathology practices routinely order upfront levels on all gastrointestinal biopsies , often generating 2 or 3 slides. Additional slides increase costs , increase the likelihood of laboratory-generated errors , and can waste limited tissue on small biopsies for which ancillary studies may be necessary. Our study showed that a single level is sufficient in the overwhelming majority of cases in which a lesion<symptom> is identified histologically.
