 The aim of this study was to evaluate a smartphone application , SIMPL , to optimize faculty guidance and oral medicine residents ' performance , and to measure resident-faculty agreement for performance and supervision levels. Raters used the 5-level `` Performance '' scale to assess resident 's readiness for independent practice and the 4-level Zwisch scale to assess faculty guidance , between June 2016 and June 2017. Junior residents were trainees with less than 18 months of training , and senior residents had more than 18 months of training. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze supervision and autonomy. Performance and supervision agreement was estimated as percentage-agreement and measured using κ and 95 % confidence intervals. A total of 660 evaluations were performed by 6 residents and 6 faculty members. Senior residents received higher performance scores compared with junior residents ( P for trend < .01). In terms of complexity of cases and level of supervision , there were no significant differences between juniors and seniors ( P = .69 and P = .39 , respectively). Residents were `` practice ready '' or greater than for 80 % cases. Residents received meaningful autonomy for 64.8 % cases. Faculty-resident concordance was 86.1 % for performance ( with κ of 0.77 ( 95 % CI 66.1 % -87.6 %)) and 92.4 % for supervision ( with κ of 0.84 ( 95 % CI 80 % -88 %)). SIMPL can feasibly be used for real-time assessment of residents ' performance and autonomy.
