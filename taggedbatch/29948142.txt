 In order to understand its diverse functions , we have studied cohesin in the evolutionarily distant ciliate model organism Tetrahymena thermophila. In this binucleate cell , the heritable germline genome is maintained separately from the transcriptionally active somatic genome. In a previous study , we showed that a minimal cohesin complex in Tetrahymena consisted of homologs of Smc1 , Smc3 , and Rec8 , which are present only in the germline nucleus , where they are needed for normal chromosome segregation as well as meiotic DNA repair. In this study , we confirm that a putative homolog of Scc3 is a member of this complex. In the absence of Scc3 , Smc1 and Rec8 fail to localize to germline nuclei , Rec8 is hypo-phosphorylated , and cells show phenotypes similar to depletion of Smc1 and Rec8. We also identify a homolog of Scc2 , which in other organisms is part of a heterodimeric complex ( Scc2/Scc4) that helps load cohesin onto chromatin. In Tetrahymena , Scc2 interacts with Rec8 and Scc3 , and its absence causes defects in mitotic and meiotic divisions. Scc2 is not required for chromosomal association of cohesin , but Rec8 is hypo-phosphorylated in its absence. Moreover , we did not identify a homolog of the cohesin loader Scc4 , and no evidence was found of auxiliary factors , such as Eco1 , Pds5 , or WAPL. We propose that in Tetrahymena , a single , minimal cohesin complex performs all necessary functions for germline mitosis and meiosis , but is dispensable for transcription regulation and chromatin organization of the somatic genome.
