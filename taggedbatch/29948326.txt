 Instrumentation of the lumbar spine is a common procedure for treating pathologic conditions. Studies have revealed the risks of pathologies in the adjacent segments , with the incidence rate being up to 36.1 %. Revision procedures are often required , including extension of the instrumentation by the use of connectors to adjacent levels. The aim of this study was to determine the stiffness of side-to-side and end-to-end connectors for comparison with the use of continuous rods. Ten human lumbar spine specimens ( L1-S1) were tested about the three axes under pure moment loading of Â± 7.5 Nm. Nine conditions were used to investigate the functions of the extensions for different instrumentation lengths ( L3-S1 and L2-S1) and different connector levels ( L3/4 and L2/3). The intersegmental range of motion ( iROM) and intersegmental neutral zone as well as total range of motion ( tROM) and total neutral zone ( tNZ) were analyzed. The application of the spinal system significantly decreased the tROMs (- 44 to- 83 %) and iROMs in levels L2/3 (- 56 to- 94 %) and L3/4 (- 68 to- 99 %) in all the tested directions , and the tNZ under flexion/extension (- 63 to- 71 %) and axial rotation (- 34 to- 72 %). These decreases were independent of the employed configuration ( p < 0.05). The only significant changes in the iROM were observed under lateral bending between the continuous rod and the side-to-side connector at level L3/4 ( p = 0.006). From a biomechanical viewpoint , the tested connectors are comparable to continuous rods in terms of ROM and NZ. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.
