 We herein report the case of a woman in her 80s with a recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) tumor that rapidly increased in size during direct-acting antiviral ( DAA) treatment. She suffered from HCC at her initial visit to our department and underwent hepatectomy. Thereafter , she underwent DAA treatment for chronic hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease>; however , her alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP) level rapidly increased , and a liver tumor of > 1 cm in diameter was observed that had not been seen immediately before DAA treatment. She underwent hepatectomy again and moderate<symptom> to poorly differentiated HCC was diagnosed. The patient 's AFP level showed a rapid increase immediately after the start of DAA treatment; however , the increase ceased after the first month , and the influence from the surrounding environment of the tumor was considered to be temporary.
