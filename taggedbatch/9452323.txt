 Experience about the use and safety of anti-Parkinson ( anti-PD) medication during pregnancy is scarce. We have retrospectively evaluated the course and outcome of pregnancy in PD patients who used anti-PD medication during their pregnancy. 14 PD patients who used anti-PD medication during part or whole of their pregnancy were included. Dopamine agonists were used in 13 patients , levodopa/benserazide in 4 , levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone in 1 , rasagiline in 7 , amantadine in 4 , and biperiden in 1 patient. Nine patients were on combination treatment at the time of their pregnancy. During their whole pregnancy , dopamine agonists had been used in six patients , levodopa in four , and rasagiline in one. Four patients experienced adverse outcomes: one had spontaneous<disease><symptom> abortion<disease><symptom> while receiving pramipexole , one elderly mother gave birth to a child with Down syndrome<disease><symptom> , while receiving pramipexole and rasagiline , in one case , there was fetal distress under levodopa/benserazide , piribedil , and rasagiline which resolved spontaneously , in one case , one of the twins did not survive after the birth while the mother was receiving pramipexole and rasagiline. In none of these cases an association with the use of anti-PD medication and adverse outcomes was clearly established. In one patient , motor<symptom> symptoms<symptom> worsened despite high dose levodopa , four others experienced transient worsening upon dose reduction. Results in our case series suggest that levodopa , rasagiline , pramipexole , and ropinirole alone or in combination with each other may be considered relatively safe during pregnancy. Expected benefits and risks should be considered when prescribing anti-PD medication in pregnant women.
