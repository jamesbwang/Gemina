 Ancestor microbes started colonizing inland habitats approximately 2.7 to 3.5 billion years ago. With some exceptions , the key physiological adaptations of microbiomes associated with marine-to-land transitions have remained elusive. This is essentially caused by the lack of suitable systems that depict changes in microbiomes across sufficiently large time scales. Here , we investigate the adaptive routes taken by microbiomes along a contemporary gradient of land formation. Using functional trait-based metagenomics , we show that a switch from a microbial ` dispersal ' to a ` competition ' response modus best characterizes the microbial trait changes during this eco-evolutionary trajectory. The ` dispersal ' modus prevails in microbiomes at the boundary sites between land and sea. It encompasses traits conferring cell chemosensory and motile behaviors , thus allowing the local microbes to exploit short-lived nutritional patches in high-diffusion microhabitats. A systematic transition towards the ` competition ' modus occurs progressively as the soil matures , which is likely due to forces of viscosity or strain that favor traits for competition and chemical defense. Concomitantly , progressive increases in the abundances of genes encoding antibiotic resistance and complex organic substrate degradation were found. Our findings constitute a novel perspective on the ecology and evolution of microbiome traits , tracking back one of the most seminal transitions in the evolutionary history of life.
