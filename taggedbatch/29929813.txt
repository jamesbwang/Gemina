 To evaluate the safety and efficacy of incobotulinumtoxinA ( IncoA) injection for treatment of essential hand tremor<symptom>. In essential tremor<symptom> and Parkinson 's disease tremor<symptom> , administration of onabotulinumtoxinA via a fixed injection approach improves the tremor<symptom> but a high percentage of patients ( 30-70 %) develop moderate<symptom> to severe hand weakness<symptom> which has limited its use in clinical practice. This study was performed from July 2013 to July 2016 on 33 subjects. This is a double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover trial injecting 80-120 units of IncoA into 8-14 hand and forearm muscles using a customized approach. The subjects were followed for 28 weeks. The treatment efficacy was evaluated by the Fahn Tolosa Marin tremor<symptom> rating score and NIH genetic criteria for tremor<symptom> severity at 4 and 8 weeks after each of the two sets of treatments. Hand strength was assessed by an ergometer. There was statistically significant improvement in clinical rating score of tremor<symptom> at 4 and 8 weeks following the IncoA injection. In this study , injection of IncoA treatment via a customized approach improved essential tremor<symptom> on the clinical scales and patient 's perception with a low occurrence of significant hand weakness<symptom>.
