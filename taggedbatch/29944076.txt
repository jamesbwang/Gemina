 Peripartum women are exposed to a variety of stressors that have adverse health consequences for the maternal-child dyad ( e.g. , impaired bonding). To combat these adverse health consequences , heart rate variability biofeedback ( HRVBF) may be implemented by holistic nurses to aid peripartum women experiencing a high level of stress. A systematic review was completed using the guidelines established in the PRISMA ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. To be included in the review , studies had to meet the following criteria: ( a) published scientific articles , ( b) studies published in English , ( c) experimental , quasi-experimental , or case reports , ( d) use of HRVBF as the main treatment , ( e) use of psychological stress as a dependent variable , and ( f) studies published until December 2017. The major findings of this review can be described as follows: ( a) HRVBF and psychological stress in peripartum women are related concepts , ( b) peripartum women who completed HRVBF report a reduction in stress compared with participants who did not receive HRVBF , and ( c) there is currently no information on the effectiveness of HRVBF on psychological stress in the first and early second trimester of pregnancy. Overall , this systematic review of the literature provides objective evidence that HRVBF may be a potential beneficial adjuvant treatment for stress management in peripartum women.
