 Hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection has been related to self-reactivity , extrahepatic manifestations and autoimmune diseases. The main goals of this work were to study the prevalence of autoantibodies and their relationship with viral titers and biochemical markers of hepatic damage in patients infected with HCV<pathogen>. Autoantibodies ( ANA , AMA , SMA , APC , LKM , DNAds , ANCA , ATG and RF) were determined in 73 individuals with chronic HCV<pathogen> infection and 44 healthy volunteers. The presence of these antibodies was related to demographic variables , viral titers and biochemical parameters. A high prevalence of autoantibodies , particularly for RF , that was associated with female gender was observed in HCV-infected patients. In addition , SMA , ANA and ATG showed increased frequencies in HCV<pathogen> infection. Interestingly , the concurrent detection of SMA and more than one autoantibody was associated with high gGT levels. Notably , concurrent higher gGT , HCV<pathogen> and SMA levels were observed in male patients as compared to their female counterparts. These results indicate a relationship between HCV<pathogen> infection and the concurrent detection of various autoantibodies in the absence of symptoms of autoimmune diseases. They also suggest a link among the presence of a variety of autoantibodies simultaneously with SMA , increased gGT levels and HCV<pathogen> titers in a population of male patients.
