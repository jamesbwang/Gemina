 Malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma can be defined only after the development of metastases in nonchromaffin tissues. There is no single clinical parameter that is sufficiently reliable to predict metastatic potential , so our goal was to develop a prediction model based on multiple clinical parameters. The baseline age , size , extra-adrenal location , secretory type score was calculated in a retrospective cohort study comprising 333 patients with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. In each patient , each variable for age ≤ 35 years , tumor size ≥ 6.0 cm , extra-adrenal , and norepinephrine-secretory type was coded as 1 point ( otherwise 0 point); these points were summed to yield age , size , extra-adrenal location , secretory type score. Metastases occurred in 23 of 333 patients ( 6.9 %). Metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma was associated with age ≤ 35 years ( hazard ratio ( HR) 2.74 , 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI) 1.19-6.35) , tumor size ≥ 6.0 cm ( HR 2.43 , 95 % CI 1.06-5.56) , extra-adrenal location ( HR 2.73 , 95 % confidence interval 1.10-7.40) , and tumor producing only norepinephrine ( HR 2.96 , 95 % CI 1.30-6.76). The area under the curve of the age , size , extra-adrenal location , secretory type score was 0.735. There was a significant difference in metastasis-free survival between participants with age , size , extra-adrenal location , secretory type score ≥ 2 and score < 2 ( P < .0001 by the log rank test). The negative predictive value of this system was 96.5 % for a cutoff point of 2. We developed a new prediction model , the age , size , extra-adrenal location , secretory type score , based on multiple clinical parameters to assess the metastatic potential of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.
