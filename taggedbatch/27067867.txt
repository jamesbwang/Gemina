 Subjective aspects of dental prosthesis need in middle-aged adults are poorly explored , especially when the population presents chronic<disease> diseases<disease>. Objectives: To investigate if the use and necessity of dental prosthesis influence the self-perceptions of health and dental treatment need in middle-aged adults with chronic<disease> diseases<disease>. A cross-sectional study was performed in 210 middle-aged adults. Socio-demographic aspects , dental services use , oral and general perceptions of health , dental treatment need and OIDP were assessed using a standardized questionnaire. One trained dentist evaluated the use and necessity of dental prosthesis. Data were analyzed using Chi-square and multivariate logistic regression ( The use of dental prosthesis showed a proportion of 2.2:1 for upper to lower arch. Dental prosthesis need was largely prevalent ( 90 and 95 % in upper and lower arch , respectively). The self-perceptions of dental treatment need and oral health were associated with the use and necessity of dental prosthesis ( The self-perception of oral health was influenced by the use of maxillary dental prosthesis in individuals with chronic<disease> disease<disease>. Moreover , individuals were more likely able to perceive treatment need when the lower jaw was affected by tooth loss.
