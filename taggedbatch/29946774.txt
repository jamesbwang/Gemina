 The study of cancer cell metabolism has traditionally focused on glycolysis and glutaminolysis. However , lipidomic technologies have matured considerably over the last decade and broadened our understanding of how lipid metabolism is relevant to cancer biology ( 1-- 3). Studies now suggest that the reprogramming of cellular lipid metabolism contributes directly to malignant transformation and progression ( 4 , 5). For example , de novo lipid synthesis can supply proliferating tumor cells with phospholipid components that comprise the plasma and organelle membranes<symptom> of new daughter cells ( 6 , 7). Moreover , the upregulation of mitochondrial Î²-oxidation can support tumor cell energetics and redox homeostasis ( 8) , while lipid-derived messengers can regulate major signaling pathways or coordinate immunosuppressive mechanisms ( 9-- 11). Lipid metabolism has therefore become implicated in a variety of oncogenic processes , including metastatic colonization , drug resistance , and cell differentiation ( 10 , 12-- 16). However , whether we can safely and effectively modulate the underlying mechanisms for cancer therapy is still an open question.
