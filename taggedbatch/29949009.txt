 Cardiac complications frequently occur after subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( SAH) and are associated with an increased risk of neurological complications and poor outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of acute cardiac complications after SAH on long-term mortality and cardiovascular events. All patients admitted to our Neuro intensive care unit with verified SAH from January 2010 to April 2015 , and electrocardiogram , echocardiogram , and troponin T or NTproBNP data obtained within 72 h of admission were included in the study. Mortality data were obtained from the Swedish population register. Data regarding cause of death and hospitalization for cardiovascular events were obtained from the Swedish Board of Health and Welfare. A total of 455 patients were included in the study analysis. There were 102 deaths during the study period. Cardiac troponin release ( HR 1.08 , CI 1.02-1.15 per 100 ng/l , p = 0.019) , NTproBNP ( HR 1.05 , CI 1.01-1.09 per 1000 ng/l , p = 0.018) , and ST-T abnormalities ( HR 1.53 , CI 1.02-2.29 , p = 0.040) were independently associated with an increased risk of death. However , these associations were significant only during the first 3 months after the hemorrhage<symptom>. Cardiac events were observed in 25 patients , and cerebrovascular events were observed in 62 patients during the study period. ST-T abnormalities were independently associated with an increased risk of cardiac events ( HR 5.52 , CI 2.07-14.7 , p < 0.001) , and stress cardiomyopathy was independently associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular events ( HR 3.65 , CI 1.55-8.58 , p = 0.003). Cardiac complications after SAH are associated with an increased risk of short-term death. Patients with electrocardiogram abnormalities and stress cardiomyopathy need appropriate follow-up for the identification of cardiac disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
