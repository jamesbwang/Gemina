 Systemic inflammation<symptom> plays a pivotal role in a multitude of conditions , including sepsis<disease> , trauma , major surgery and burns. However , comprehensive analysis of the pathophysiology underlying this systemic inflammatory response is greatly complicated by variations in the immune response observed in critically ill patients , which is a result of inter-individual differences in comorbidity , comedication , source of infection , causative pathogen , and onset of the inflammatory response. During experimental human endotoxemia , human subjects are challenged with purified endotoxin ( lipopolysaccharide) intravenously which induces a short-lived , well-tolerated and controlled systemic inflammatory response , similar to that observed during sepsis<disease>. The human endotoxemia model can be conducted in a highly standardized and reproducible manner , using a carefully selected homogenous study population. As such , the experimental human endotoxemia model does not share the aforementioned clinical limitations and enables us to investigate both the mechanisms of systemic inflammation<symptom> , as well as to evaluate novel ( pharmacological) interventions in humans in vivo. The present review provides a detailed overview of the various designs , organ-specific changes , and strengths and limitations of the experimental human endotoxemia model , with the main focus on its use as a translational model for sepsis<disease> research.
