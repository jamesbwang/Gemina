 Gross tumor volume ( GTV) denotes the macroscopic tumor which as the central target volume needs to be correctly identified for successful radiotherapy. In precision radiotherapy , GTV is outlined on 3D tomographic images. The basis is computed tomography ( CT) , which is often supplemented by additional diagnostic information , e. g. magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) and positron emission tomography ( PET). New developments like dual-energy CT , functional MRI and specific PET tracers facilitate a continuously better differentiation between tumor and surrounding normal tissue. The concept of GTV is a central part of radiotherapy and the basis of radiation treatment planning. Studies regarding the interobserver variability are performed in order to analyze the impact of different imaging modalities , interventions and observer qualifications , and to deduce steps to constantly improve the practical realization. Each tumor entity presents specific challenges which are demonstrated here using examples.
