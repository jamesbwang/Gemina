 Post-transcriptional mechanisms play a predominant role in the control of microRNA ( miRNA) production. Recognition of the terminal loop of precursor miRNAs by RNA-binding proteins ( RBPs) influences their processing; however , the mechanistic basis for how levels of individual or subsets of miRNAs are regulated is mostly unexplored. We previously showed that hnRNP A1 , an RBP implicated in many aspects of RNA processing , acts as an auxiliary factor that promotes the Microprocessor-mediated processing of pri-mir-18a. Here , by using an integrative structural biology approach , we show that hnRNP A1 forms a 1:1 complex with pri-mir-18a where both RNA recognition motifs ( RRMs) bind to cognate RNA sequence motifs in the terminal loop of pri-mir-18a. Terminal loop binding induces an allosteric destabilization of base-pairing in the pri-mir-18a stem that promotes its downstream processing. Our results highlight terminal loop RNA recognition by RBPs as a potential general principle of miRNA biogenesis and regulation.
