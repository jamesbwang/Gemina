 Persistent carotid-basilar connections have a prevalence of 0.14 %. Recognizing such persistent fetal anastomoses between the carotid and the vertebrobasilar circulation is of great importance since they are reportedly associated with an increased prevalence of intracranial aneurysms<disease>. We report the case of a 15-year-old female who presented with a WFNS grade 5 subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> from an aneurysm<disease> at the junction of a persistent primitive hypoglossal artery and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery origin. Supratentorially , unfortunately , there was no parenchymal blush or cortical venous return. Eventually , a multidisciplinary decision was made to withdraw care. Fifty-seven cases were reported in the literature to date of persistent hypoglossal arteries , 16 of which presented with an associated aneurysm<disease> , 5 with an arterio-venous malformation and 6 with a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Our case is the youngest patient reported so far. Hypoplasia or aplasia of the vertebral artery were often encountered ( 36 and 13 cases respectively) , as well as carotid artery stenosis ( 15 cases). Although uncommon , it is important to recognize persistent carotid-basilar connections , since they have a considerable hemodynamic impact on the posterior cerebral circulation via the carotid system. A critical reduction in the carotid blood flow will , therefore , have ischemic consequences in the posterior cerebral territories. In addition , such connections might be associated with anomalies of the vessel wall and be predisposed to aneurysm<disease> formation. The endovascular neuro-interventionalist , as well as the vascular and skull base neurosurgeon need to be aware of their anatomy and variations.
