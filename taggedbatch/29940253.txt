 The artificial urinary sphincter is a common treatment of male urinary incontinence. We sought to characterize long-term rates of artificial urinary sphincter revision/removal and reimplantation , and associated risk factors. We performed a population based , retrospective study using the Ontario Health Insurance Plan database of all male patients who underwent artificial urinary sphincter implantation from 1994 to 2013. Hospital , diagnostic and billing codes were used to identify patients. The Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were applied to examine the cumulative incidence of artificial urinary sphincter reimplantation and revision/removal , and identify risk factors , respectively. A total of 1,632 male patients underwent initial implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter. The 10-year revision/removal and reimplantation rates were 34 % and 27 % , respectively. There was no difference between high and low volume hospitals or between community and academic hospitals in terms of revision/removal. A high level of comorbidity was associated with an increasing risk of removal/revision. The reimplantation rate was significantly lower in patients who underwent insertion at hospitals with the highest volume of surgery ( HR 0.55 , 95 % CI 0.37-0.82 , p < 0.01). A high level of comorbidity was not associated with an increasing risk of reimplantation. Preimplantation radiotherapy was not significantly associated with the risk of reimplantation ( p = 0.17) or revision/removal ( p = 0.95). Other factors were not significantly associated with reimplantation or revision/removal. Most men who undergo artificial urinary sphincter placement still have a device without repeat surgery 10 years following insertion. Radiotherapy does not increase the risk of repeat surgery. A high level of comorbidity was associated with an increasing risk of removal/revision.
