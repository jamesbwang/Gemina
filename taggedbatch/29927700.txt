 In Korea , the major clonal type of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( CA-MRSA) is sequence type 72 ( ST72) with staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec ( SCCmec) type IV ( ST72-MRSA-IV). In this study , we used a previously well-characterized isogenic pair of ST72 vancomycin ( VAN) susceptible-and VAN intermediate-MRSA strains ( VSSA303 and VISA072) and several VSSA strains complemented with plasmids expressing single-point mutated genes ( dprA
