 Sepsis<disease> is a life-threatening condition caused by pathogen infection and associated with pyroptosis. Pyroptosis occurs upon activation of proinflammatory caspases and their subsequent cleavage of gasdermin D ( GSDMD) , resulting in GSDMD N-terminal fragments that form membrane pores to induce cell lysis. Here , we show that antioxidant defense enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 ( GPX4) and its ability to decrease lipid peroxidation , negatively regulate macrophage pyroptosis , and septic lethality in mice. Conditional Gpx4 knockout in myeloid lineage cells increases lipid peroxidation-dependent caspase-11 activation and GSDMD cleavage. The resultant N-terminal GSDMD fragments then trigger macrophage pyroptotic cell death in a phospholipase C gamma 1 ( PLCG1)- dependent fashion. Administration of the antioxidant vitamin E that reduces lipid peroxidation , chemical inhibition of PLCG1 , or genetic Caspase-11 deletion or Gsdmd inactivation prevents polymicrobial sepsis<disease> in Gpx4
