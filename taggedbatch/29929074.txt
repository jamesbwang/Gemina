 This study focuses on the investigation of removal of textile dye ( Reactive Yellow) by a combined approach of sorption integrated with biodegradation using low cost adsorbent fly ash immobilized with Pseudomonas<pathogen> sp.. To ensure immobilization of bacterial species on treated fly ash , fly ash with immobilized bacterial cells was characterized using Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR) spectroscopy , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , and fluorescence microscopy. Comparative batch studies were carried out using Pseudomonas<pathogen> sp , fly ash and immobilized Pseudomonas sp on flyash and were observed that immobilized Pseudomonas sp on flyash acted as better decolourizing agent. The optimized pH , temperature , and immobilized adsorbent dosage for highest percentage of dye removal were observed to be pH 6 , 303 K , 1.2 g/L in all the cases. At optimum condition , the highest percentage of dye removal was found to be 88.51 % , 92.62 % and 98.72 % for sorption ( flyash) , biodegradation ( Pseudomonas sp) and integral approach ( Pseudomonas sp on flyash) respectively. Optimization of operating parameters of textile dye decolourization was done by response surface methodology ( RSM) using Design Expert 7 software. Phytotoxicity evaluation with Cicer arietinum revealed that seeds exposed to untreated dye effluents showed considerably lower growth , inhibited biochemical , and enzyme parameters with compared to those exposed to treated textile effluents. Thus this immobilized inexpensive technique could be used for removal of synthetic dyes present in textile wastewater.
