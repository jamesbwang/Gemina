 Heterozygosity has been positively associated with fitness and population survival. However , the relationship between heterozygosity and adaptive phenotypic plasticity ( i.e. , plasticity which results in fitness homeostasis or improvement in changing environments) is unclear and has been poorly explored in seaweeds. In this study , we explored this relationship in the clonal red seaweed ,
