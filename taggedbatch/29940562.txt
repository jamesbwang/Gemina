 High mobility group box-1 ( HMGB-1) , a typical damage-associated molecular pattern protein released from various cells , was first identified in 1973. It is usually stored in the nuclei of cells. Several modifications of HMGB-1 promote its translocation to the cytosol , and it is actively or passively released from cells. When outside of the cells , HMGB-1is crucial in inflammation<symptom>. It exerts its biological functions via interaction with its receptors , including receptor for advanced glycation end products ( RAGE) and Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4). A large number of studies showed a close link between inflammation<symptom> and thrombosis. This review demonstrated the increased expression of HMGB-1 in thrombosis-related diseases , including coronary artery disease , stroke , peripheral arterial disease , disseminated intravascular coagulation , and venous thrombosis. Besides , it summarized the current understanding of the emerging link between HMGB-1 and thrombosis from three aspects: platelet , NETs , and coagulation and fibrinolysis factors. Finally , it explored the possible therapeutic strategies targeting HMGB-1 for treating thrombosis-related diseases.
