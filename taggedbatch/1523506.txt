 Iliac screw placement is challenging due to the particular anatomy of the ilium. Most series have reported the use of relatively short ( ≤ 90 mm in length) screws despite a long iliac buttress , which has an average length of 129 mm in females and 141 mm in males. This study describes a series of 14 patients who underwent placement of long iliac screws ( ≥ 100 mm in length) as part of a spinopelvic fusion utilizing fluoroscopy alone. All patients who received at least one long iliac screw were included in this study. Placement accuracy , the average distance from the screw tip to the anterior inferior iliac spine ( AIIS) , neurovascular injuries , acetabulum and/or sciatic notch violations , and screw prominence were all measured. Fourteen patients received 38 iliac screws , with 31 screws being ≥ 100 mm in length. The accuracy rate was 87.1 % ( 27/31) for the long iliac screws. The average shortest distance from the iliac screw tip to the AIIS was 15.5 mm for the right-sided and 17.1 mm for the left-sided ilia. There were no neurovascular injuries , acetabulum , or sciatic notch violations , and no screws loosened or fractured. Of interest , only one patient required off-set connectors to link the rods to the iliac screws. Placement of long iliac screws under intraoperative fluoroscopy only was shown to be feasible , with a high accuracy rate and few complications , in this series of patients.
