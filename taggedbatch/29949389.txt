- Anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies are important serologic markers for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom>. Several kinds of test reagents for automated immunoassay systems have been developed and used in recent years.- To evaluate the analytic and diagnostic performance of the new ADVIA Centaur anticyclic citrullinated peptide assay ( Siemens Healthineers , Erlangen , Germany) compared with the Elecsys assay ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany).- A total of 576 serum samples were collected from subjects , including 156 patients ( 27 %) with rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom>. Precision performance and analytical measurement range for the ADVIA assay were evaluated. Diagnostic performance of the 2 assays was compared based on sensitivity , specificity , and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves.- The ADVIA assay showed a within-laboratory imprecision of 3.4 % coefficient of variation for levels of 3.36 and 24.99 U/mL. This assay was demonstrated to be linear from 0.4 to 180.0 U/mL. With default cutoff values , sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> were 71.2 % and 97.9 % , respectively , for the ADVIA assay and 73.1 % and 96.9 % , respectively , for the Elecsys assay. With the best cutoff values from the analyses of the receiver operating characteristic curve , the sensitivity of the 2 assays was the same at 75.6 %. However , the specificity of the ADVIA assay was 96.4 % , whereas that of the Elecsys assay was 94.3 %. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value for the ADVIA assay was 0.867 , which was not significantly different from that of the Elecsys assay ( 0.865).- The ADVIA Centaur anticyclic citrullinated peptide assay showed good analytic and diagnostic performance in diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom>.
