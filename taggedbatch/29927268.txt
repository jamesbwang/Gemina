 The aim of the current study was to assess whether pigeons could acquire a four-item list by trial and error. Pigeons received either extensive list training prior to being tested on a novel four-item list ( i.e. , the full-training group) or very limited training ( i.e. , the limited-training group). Specifically , subjects in the full-training group were trained to acquire a large set of two-item lists by trial and error , then a large set of three-item lists , and finally a large set of four-item lists. In addition , within each set , the number of training phases was gradually reduced. In contrast , the limited-training group were trained on a single four-item list prior to testing. Only one of the eight subjects ( 12.5 %) in the limited-training group learned the novel four-item list. In contrast , all five subjects ( 100 %) in the full-training group learned the novel four-item list. We suggest that the difference between groups reflects the fact that subjects in the full-training group acquired a learning set over the course of their extensive training. The current study is the first to demonstrate pigeons can learn a four-item list without phased training. ( PsycINFO Database Record
