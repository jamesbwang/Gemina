 Calretinin is the most widespread positive marker for the immunohistochemical identification of malignant mesothelioma ( MM) and was proposed to serve as a blood-based biomarker. Functionally , evidence has accumulated that calretinin might be implicated in MM tumorigenesis. We aimed to identify calretinin ( CR; NF2 No expression of calretinin at the protein level was detected , neither in MM from NF2 The concomitant determination of calretinin and mesothelin blood levels has been proposed for early detection of human MM. Mouse MM models based on asbestos exposure are assumed to yield helpful information on the time course of appearance of mesothelin and calretinin in the blood of asbestos-treated mice determining the earliest time point for interventions. However , the observed absence of calretinin in MM from NF2
