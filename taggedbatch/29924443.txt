 Impaired lung function is regarded as a risk factor for stroke in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However , the association between reduced lung function and incident stroke in a community-based population with sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB) remains unknown. A prospective study was performed within the Sleep Heart Health Study cohort. Full montage home sleep testing and spirometry data on 2082 and 2072 individuals with and without SDB , respectively , were analysed. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the association between lung function and incident stroke. Over 11.7 years , 183 cases of stroke were identified in participants without pre-existing cardiovascular diseases , including 71 and 112 with an apnoea-hypopnoea index < 5 events/h and â‰¥ 5 events/h , respectively. In the entire population , lung function was inversely associated with incident stroke ( hazard ratio ( HR) 0.913 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.839-0.994) for every 10 % increase in percentage of predicted forced vital capacity). When the population was divided according to the presence/absence of SDB , the association of lung function with incident stroke became stronger in individuals with SDB ( HR 0.899 ( 0.822-0.984) for every 10 % increase in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s; HR 0.881 ( 0.787-0.987) for every 10 % increase in percentage of predicted forced vital capacity) but not in individuals without SDB. Lung function may serve as a risk factor for incident stroke in a community-based population , especially in those with SDB. Spirometry may help improve the risk management for primary care in community-based populations.
