 HLA-A * 31:01 has been associated with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity<disease> reactions. HLA-A * 31:01 genetic testing is recommended before the initiation of carbamazepine therapy. A novel real-time PCR assay was designed for HLA-A * 31:01 detection by allele-specific primers and TaqMan minor groove binding probes. The genotyping results in 100 subjects by the established method who were in 100 % agreement with the sequencing-based typing method. The assay presents a sensitivity of 1 ( 95 % CI: 0.69-1.00) , a specificity of 1 ( 95 % CI: 0.96-1.00) and a positive and negative predictive value of 1. The carrier rates of HLA-A * 31:01 in Tibetan ( n = 45) , Han Chinese ( n = 100) , Miaos ( n = 48) and Khalkhas ( n = 48) were 22.2 , 10 , 4.2 and 18.8 % , respectively. This assay is reliable to detect HLA-A * 31:01 and would be useful to prevent carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity<disease> reactions.
