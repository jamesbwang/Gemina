 The production of radiopharmaceuticals for the needs of positron emission tomography ( PET) , in particular 18F-FDG , is a multi-step process performed most often by physicists and chemists. The monitoring of occupational exposure of staff employed in radiopharmaceutical production centres includes the measurement of the Hp ( 10) and Hp ( 0.07) values. Occupational exposure to ionising radiation means that the thyroid may be , among others , affected by the radiation field. This work analyses the exposure of the thyroid gland of employees of centres that produce the isotopes for PET , in particular fluorine-18. The analysis take into account the employment structure and work system of the discussed centres. Measurements were carried out by using high-sensitivity thermoluminescence detectors ( MCP-N). The measurements covered 17 employees. Our results show that the estimated maximum annual thyroid gland exposure will not exceed 30 mSv.
