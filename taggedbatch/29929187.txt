 To show that patients with unilateral hearing loss ( UHL) , with one ear fulfilling cochlear implant ( CI) indication criteria , and an additional severe<symptom> tinnitus<symptom> handicap can be treated effectively with a CI. A prospective multi-centre study was conducted in five Spanish centres. Sixteen adult patients with UHL and a mean Tinnitus<symptom> Handicap Inventory ( THI) score of at least 58 were implanted. The study design included repeated within-subject measures of quality of life ( Health Utility Index Mark 3 ( HUI3)) , tinnitus<symptom> ( THI , Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS) on tinnitus<symptom> loudness) , hearing ( Speech , Spatial , and Qualities of Hearing Scale- ( SSQ)) , and hyperacusis ( Test de Hipersensibilidad al Sonido ( THS)) up to 12 months after the initial CI fitting. Group data showed significant subjective benefit from CI treatment: the preoperative HUI3 total utility score of 0.45 went up to 0.57 at 6 months and 0.63 at 12 months; the preoperative THI total score of 75 decreased to 40 at 6 months and 35 at 12 months. The preoperative tinnitus<symptom> loudness VAS score of 8.2 decreased to 2.4 at 6 months and 2.2 at 12 months with the implant `` On '' and to 6.7 at 6 months and 6.5 at 12 months with the implant `` Off. '' The preoperative THS total score of 26 decreased to 17 at 12 months. The preoperative SSQ total score of 4.2 increased to 5.1 at 6 months and 6.3 at 12 months. No unanticipated adverse events were reported during the study period. At 12 months after CI activation all subjects ( except 1 subject who used the device 6 days a week) wore their devices all day and every day. The primary reason for CI use was split evenly between tinnitus<symptom> suppression ( n = 6) and both hearing and tinnitus<symptom> ( n = 6). A CI should be considered as a treatment option in patients with UHL and a concomitant severe<symptom> tinnitus<symptom> handicap. However , appropriate counselling of candidates on the anticipated risks , benefits , and limitations that are inherent to cochlear implantation is imperative.
