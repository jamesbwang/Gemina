 Increasingly , researchers seek to engage communities , patients , and stakeholders as partners in the process and products of health research. However , there is no existing stakeholder-driven ethical framework for such engaged scholarship. We employed an iterative , stakeholder-engaged method to develop a data-driven framework for the ethical review and conduct of engaged scholarship. We used consensus development conference methods and a modified Delphi survey to engage 240 community members , ethicists , and academic researchers. This multi-staged process produced a framework with 4 domains: vision of equitable and just research , relationship dynamics , community-informed risk/benefits assessment , and accountability. Within the framework , 4 cross-cutting considerations and 15 statements explicate the stakeholders ' priorities for the ethical review and conduct of engaged scholarship. Though the findings are promising , the study is limited in that it focuses on stakeholder perspectives , but does not actually evaluate or apply the findings in the field. The stakeholder-engaged framework provides a platform for further articulation of ethical practices and policy for engaged scholarship.
