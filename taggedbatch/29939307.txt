 The promotion and maintenance of workers ' mental health is an increasingly important issue , both for employers and society. Previous research has shown that job characteristics ( i.e. demands , control and support) are significantly associated with employees ' mental well-being. However , changes in work characteristics have given rise to the emergence of new job demands , leading to work-family life conflict. To investigate the association between work-family life conflict and employee mental well-being. A cross-sectional study with two samples: one sample comprising clothes store sales employees and the other comprising call centre operators. Logistic regression models were used to examine the effects of work-family life conflict on employee well-being. After controlling for job demands , job control , supervisory support and co-workers support , work-family life conflict was associated with employee mental well-being. Work-family life conflict is an important factor to explain employee well-being and productivity and should be addressed as well as work factors.
