 It is a particularly challenging task in stereochemistry to determine the absolute configuration of chiral molecules , i.e. to assign to a given sample the microscopic enantiomeric structure. In recent years , Coulomb Explosion Imaging ( CEI) has been shown to yield directly the absolute configuration of small molecules in the gas phase. This contribution describes the experimental basics of this approach , highlights the most significant results and discusses limitations. A short discussion on extending Coulomb Explosion Imaging beyond analytic aspects to fundamental questions of molecular chirality concludes this review.
