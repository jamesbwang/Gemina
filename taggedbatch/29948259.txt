 Older adults may evidence changes in swallowing physiology. Our goals were to identify dysphagia<symptom> risk in community-dwelling older adults with no history of dysphagia<symptom> , and to compare swallowing physiology and safety between older and younger adults. Thirty-two older adults with no history of dysphagia<symptom> were prospectively recruited and completed the Dysphagia<symptom> Handicap Index ( DHI) , two trials of a 3 oz. swallow screen , and videofluoroscopy ( VFSS). Self-ratings of swallowing function were compared to published norms by paired t tests , and multivariate logistic regression models were generated to determine whether these ratings and VFSS analysis of swallowing function were associated with failure of one or both swallow screen trials. Archived VFSS of 33 younger adults were compared to older adults with Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. The DHI scores of older adults were higher than published non-dysphagic adults but lower than dysphagic adults. Older participants with greater Oral Residue scores were more likely to fail both swallow screen trials. Older adults received higher median MBSImP ™ © scores for select pharyngeal<symptom> components than younger adults. The two age groups did not differ on Penetration-Aspiration Scale scores , and no aspiration was observed. Measures of swallowing in older individuals may reflect age-related sensory and motor<symptom> changes<symptom> in the context of functional swallowing and adequate airway protection.
