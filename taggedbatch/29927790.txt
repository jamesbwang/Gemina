 Microglia-neuron signalling in the spinal<disease> cord is a key mediator of mechanical allodynia caused by peripheral nerve injury. We recently reported sex differences in microglia in pain signalling in mice: spinal mechanisms underlying nerve injury-induced allodynia are microglial dependent in male but not female mice. Whether this sex difference in pain hypersensitivity<disease> mechanisms is conserved in other species is unknown. Here , we show that in rats , the spinal mechanisms of nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity<disease> in males differ from those in females , with microglial P2X4 receptors ( P2X4Rs) being a key point of divergence. In rats , nerve injury produced comparable allodynia and reactive microgliosis in both sexes. However , inhibiting microglia in the spinal<disease> cord reversed allodynia in male rats but not female rats. In addition , pharmacological blockade of P2X4Rs , by an intrathecally administered antagonist , attenuated pain hypersensitivity<disease> in male rats only. Consistent with the behavioural findings , nerve injury increased cell surface expression and function of P2X4Rs in acutely isolated spinal microglia from male rats but not from female rats. Moreover , in microglia cultured from male rats , but not in those from female rats , stimulating P2X4Rs drove intracellular signalling through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Furthermore , chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR revealed that the transcription factor IRF5 differentially binds to the P2rx4 promoter region in female rats vs male rats. Finally , mechanical allodynia was produced in otherwise naive rats by intrathecally administering P2X4R-stimulated microglia from male rats but not those from female rats. Together , our findings demonstrate the existence of sexually dimorphic pain signalling in rats , suggesting that this sex difference is evolutionarily conserved , at least across rodent species.
