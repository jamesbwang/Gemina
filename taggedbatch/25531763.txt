 A six-year-old girl presented to an emergency room after describing choking on a rubber band. She was in no distress and was discharged. Over the course of the next 9 months , she had numerous outpatient and emergency room visits due to intermittent stridor , difficulty breathing , and hoarseness<symptom>. Eventually , dedicated airway films revealed a laryngeal foreign body. During rigid bronchoscopy , a two-centimeter rubber band was discovered in the larynx. It extended from the supraglottis , through the glottis , and into the subglottis. It was successfully removed. The patient was asymptomatic 24 hours later. This case highlights the appropriate evaluation and management of a child with stridor.
