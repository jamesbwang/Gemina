 Oxidative stress is commonly involved in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer 's disease , Parkinson 's disease , Huntington 's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Therefore , lipophilic antioxidants , such as vitamin A , carotinoids , vitamin E , coenzyme Q10 , docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid , have received increasing attention as therapeutic and preventive intervention for neurodegenerative diseases. Although difficulties exist with clinical studies due to the nature of the long-standing progression of neurodegenerative diseases , findings in cell and animal models , as well as biomarker studies have implied a relationship between lipophilic antioxidants and neurodegeneration. By reviewing current findings and their implication in neurodegenerative diseases , we conclude that although none of these lipophilic antioxidants have yet provided clear-cut clinical evidence toward beneficial effects in neurodegenerative diseases , they could demonstrate neuroprotection in cellular and/or animal studies. Results from future multidisciplinary studies with optimization of factors including drug dosage , delivery route and chemical structure may provide us with novel treatments for neurodegenerative diseases using lipophilic antioxidants.
