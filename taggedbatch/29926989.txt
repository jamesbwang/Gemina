 Brexit may lead to major political , societal , and financial changes-this has significant implications for a tax revenue funded healthcare system such as the United Kingdom 's ( UK) National Health Service. The complex relationship between European Union ( EU) legislation and clinical practice of organ donation and transplantation is poorly understood. However , it is unclear what impact Brexit may have on organ donation and transplantation in the UK and EU. This work aims to describe the current legislative interactions affecting organ donation and transplantation regulation and governance within the UK and EU. We consider the potential impact of Brexit on the practical aspects of transplantation such organ-sharing networks , logistics , and the provision of health care for transplant patients when traveling to the EU from the UK and vice versa , as well as personnel , and research. Successful organ donation and transplantation practices rely on close collaboration and co-operation across Europe and throughout the United Kingdom. The continuation of such relationships , despite the proposed legislative change , will remain a vital and necessary component for the ongoing success of transplantation programs.
