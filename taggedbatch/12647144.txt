 The richness of ectoparasite species associated with Sigmodontinae rodents ( Cricetidae) from different sites located in the coastal wetlands of the RÃ­o de la Plata in Argentina was predicted by a model with three components: ( 1) habitat type , considered analogous to rodent species; ( 2) average ectoparasite species richness on each rodent species , and ( 3) average number of rodent species parasitized by each ectoparasite species. The model , based on rodent information ( number of species and total number of captured rodents) and the environmental gradient , has a reasonably good fit for the observed data as well as independent data from different localities. The model is predictive and robust , and it could be a useful tool for epidemiological and biodiversity management strategies. Furthermore , the model could be adapted to other habitats if a suitable estimate of an environmental gradient is found , and it could be also possible to adapt it to other host taxa.
