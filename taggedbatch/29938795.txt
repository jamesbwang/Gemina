 The present study performed three experiments to establish a practical prevention strategy for the ectoparasitic flagellate Ichthyobodo salmonis<pathogen> and ciliate Trichodina truttae in hatchery-reared juvenile chum salmon Oncorhynchus<pathogen> keta using dietary supplementation with oregano essential oil. Experiment 1 showed that a diet supplemented for 3 weeks with 0.02 % oregano essential oil significantly prevented infection with I. salmonis<pathogen> and T. truttae in juveniles reared in small tanks. Experiment 2 , in outdoor hatchery ponds , demonstrated that the oregano treatment completely prevented I. salmonis<pathogen> infection for 52 days and T. truttae infection for 38 days. Oregano-treated juvenile mortality attributable to infection with these protozoans also decreased to 7.6 % of control juvenile mortality , confirming the utility of this treatment in cultured O. keta. Physiological analyses of the oregano-treated juveniles elucidated the treatment 's safety in relation to their metabolism , osmoregulation , natural immunity and olfactory responses and also detected carvacrol ( a major component of oregano essential oil which shows antimicrobial activity) on the skin. In experiment 3 , exposure of the two protozoans to oregano essential oil revealed a weak antiparasitic action on the body surface of the juvenile O. keta. The overall results demonstrate that dietary oregano supplementation is a practical prevention strategy for I. salmonis<pathogen> and T. truttae in hatchery-reared juvenile O. keta and suggest the possibility that its anti-parasitic action is attributable to a component of the oil that emerges onto the skin of the body of the fish.
