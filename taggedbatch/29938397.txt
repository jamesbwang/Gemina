 Nontidal wetlands are estimated to contribute significantly to the soil carbon pool across the globe. However , our understanding of the occurrence and variability of carbon storage between wetland types and across regions represents a major impediment to the ability of nations to include wetlands in greenhouse gas inventories and carbon offset initiatives. We performed a large-scale survey of nontidal wetland soil carbon stocks and accretion rates from the state of Victoria in south-eastern Australia-a region spanning 237,000 km
