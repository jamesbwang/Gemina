 To describe the clinical course for children with severe physical disability ( SPD) in the 2 years prior to their death and to identify whether these children had palliative care involvement and advance care planning prior to death. To investigate whether there is a difference between children with progressive ( PSPD) and non-progressive ( NPSPD) aetiologies of SPD. A retrospective cohort analysis of 48 children with SPD who died between 1 January 2013 and 1 January 2015 at The Royal Children 's Hospital , Melbourne. Clinical charts were reviewed to collect data about the type of SPD , frequency and duration of hospital admissions , duration of palliative care involvement ( if any) and presence of an advance care plan. The majority of children were admitted in the 6 months before their death , and over a third were admitted to the intensive care unit. There was a significant increase in the frequency of hospital admissions as the study cohort approached death ( P = 0.003). The majority of children with SPD were offered a referral to a palliative care service , with referrals more likely in children with PSPD ( 90 %) compared to children with NPSPD ( 57 %). While approximately 60 % of children in each cohort had an advance care plan , there was a trend towards this being formalised earlier in children with PSPD ( P = 0.09). The increase in hospital admissions prior to death in children with SPD suggests an opportunity for greater consistency in offering advanced care planning and palliative care , especially to those with NPSPD.
