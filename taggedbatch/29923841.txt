 Cyanoacrylates , also known as tissue adhesives or skin glues , are commonly used as sealants for lacerations and incisions and have found utility in excisional and cosmetic surgeries in both outpatient and operating room settings. To review the surgical literature on the utilities , advantages , disadvantages , and special uses of cyanoacrylates applicable to dermatology. PubMed was reviewed for relevant articles related to cyanoacrylates and their use in skin closures. Articles unrelated to cutaneous closures were excluded. Tissue adhesives polymerize to a water resistant , pliable film after application to approximated wound<disease><symptom> edges and have antibacterial properties. Adhesives slowly slough off as the wound<disease><symptom> heals , typically after 5 days. Compared with 5-0 nonabsorbable suture , adhesives provide similar tensile strength and similar patient and surgeon satisfaction. Although slightly more expensive than sutures , tissue adhesives obviate the need for wound<disease><symptom> dressings and suture removal. They do not perform as well as sutures for wounds<disease><symptom> under higher tension or in the setting of moisture and inadequate hemostasis. Cyanoacrylates serve as a safe and effective suture alternative in appropriate dermatologic surgeries and procedures.
