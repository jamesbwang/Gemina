 Glutamate serves as both the mammalian brain 's primary excitatory neurotransmitter and as a key neuromodulator to control synapse and circuit function over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. This functional diversity is decoded by two receptor families: ionotropic glutamate receptors ( iGluRs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mGluRs). The challenges posed by the complexity and physiological importance of each of these subtypes has limited our appreciation and understanding of how these receptors work in concert. In this review , by comparing both receptor families with a focus on their crosstalk , we argue for a more holistic understanding of neural glutamate signaling.
