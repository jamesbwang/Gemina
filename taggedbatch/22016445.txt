 Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) results from a combination of several factors leading to the obstruction of the upper respiratory<disease><symptom> tract<symptom> ( URT). OSA represents a systemic pathophysiological entity and leads to many comorbidities such as hypertension , coronary ischemia , and stroke. Patients with this pathophysiological entity experience also an increased risk of postoperative complications. Obesity is certainly the main cause of developing OSA. However , many other predisposing factors influence the genesis of obstructive apnea. It is important to understand the complexity of the interactions between predisposing factors to understand the relationship between weight<symptom> loss<symptom> following obesity surgery and the improvement in the severity of OSA. In this narrative review , we expose the seven major categories of predisposing factors that interact to generate obstructive apneas in patients , namely the anatomic abnormalities of the URT , the mechanical and the metabolic responses of the upper airway musculature , the loop gain , the arousal threshold , and the hormonal abnormalities. The genesis of apnea is the result of a complex dynamic interaction between the anatomical risk factors and the compensatory neuromuscular reflexes. All of these points are integrally part of the perioperative care of the obese patients. Finally , we will discuss different options for weight reduction.
