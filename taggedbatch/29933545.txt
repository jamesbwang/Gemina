 Porous CoFe ₂ O ₄ was prepared via a simple and controllable method to develop a low-cost , high-efficiency , and good-stability nanozyme. The morphology and microstructure of the obtained CoFe ₂ O ₄ was investigated by X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) , high-resolution TEM ( HRTEM) , specific surface area and pore analysis , and Raman spectroscopy. The results show that the annealing temperature has an important effect on the crystallinity , grain size , and specific surface area of CoFe ₂ O ₄. CoFe ₂ O ₄ obtained at 300 & deg; C ( CF300) exhibits the largest surface area ( up to 204.1 m ² g
