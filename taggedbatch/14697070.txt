 Pierre Robin sequence ( PRS)- related airway obstruction is often treated surgically; however , objective measures predicting the need for surgery are poorly defined. A retrospective chart review was performed on 171 neonates with PRS. Infants were grouped based upon intervention modality: nonsurgical ( conservative) or surgical ( mandibular distraction osteogenesis ( MDO) or tracheostomy). Demographic data , physical examination findings , and study results were compared between groups to determine risk factors for surgical intervention , and to predict long-term success or failure of those interventions. The most significant , objective risk factor among those receiving surgery was a poor preintervention sleep study ( obstructive index ( OI): 42.4 versus 12.9 for the conservative treatment group; Surgical intervention for PRS-related tongue-based airway obstruction should be strongly considered with an OI > 20. Tracheostomy should be reserved for complex patients with concomitant syndromic diagnosis , neurologic impairment , and low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight.
