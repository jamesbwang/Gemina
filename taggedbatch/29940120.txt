 NF-κB-inducing kinase ( NIK) is a protein kinase central to the noncanonical NF-κB pathway downstream from multiple TNF receptor family members , including BAFF , which has been associated with B cell survival and maturation , dendritic cell activation , secondary lymphoid organ development , and bone metabolism. We report herein the discovery of lead chemical series of NIK inhibitors that were identified through a scaffold-hopping strategy using structure-based design. Electronic and steric properties of lead compounds were modified to address glutathione conjugation and amide hydrolysis. These highly potent compounds exhibited selective inhibition of LTβR-dependent p52 translocation and transcription of NF-κB2 related genes. Compound 4f is shown to have a favorable pharmacokinetic profile across species and to inhibit BAFF-induced B cell survival in vitro and reduce splenic marginal zone B cells in vivo.
