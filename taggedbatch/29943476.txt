 Carry-over is an undesirable contamination from medicated to non-medicated feedingstuffs during feedingstuffs production. In 2009 , the European Commission recognised this phenomenon as unavoidable and set tolerable levels of coccidiostats and histomonostats as a result of carry-over in feedingstuffs intended for non-target animal species. Cross-contamination can also take place from other pharmaceuticals employed in medicated feed. No harmonized approach has been adopted by the Member States so far to evaluate non-target feedingstuffs containing veterinary drugs due to carry-over. However , the European Council and the Parliament are drafting a new regulation , fixing tolerable levels of drugs in non-target feedingstuffs. This work presents a simple and fast multi-drug method by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS) for the detection , confirmation and quantification of thirty-seven drugs belonging to different classes of antimicrobials ( sulphonamides , tetracyclines , macrolides , quinolones , pleuromutilins and streptogramins) in feedingstuffs. The method was in-house validated at carry-over levels , in the concentration range 0.25-2.0 mg kg
