 To evaluate the effects of California Proposition 47 , which reclassified felony drug offenses to misdemeanors in 2014 , on racial/ethnic disparities in drug arrests. Using data on all drug arrests made in California from 2011 to 2016 , we compared racial/ethnic disparities in drug arrests between Whites , Blacks , and Latinos , immediately and 1 year after policy changes , controlling for secular and seasonal trends. In the month following passage , absolute Black-White disparities in monthly felony drug arrests decreased from 81 to 44 per 100000 and continued to decrease over time. There was an immediate increase of 27 % in the relative disparity , however , because a higher proportion of felony offense types among Whites was reclassified. Total drug arrest rates also declined , suggesting drug law enforcement was deprioritized. During the first year after enactment , felony drug arrests fell by an estimated 51985 among Whites , 15028 among Blacks , and 50113 among Latinos. Reducing criminal penalties for drug possession can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in criminal justice exposure and has implications for improving health inequalities linked to social determinants of health.
