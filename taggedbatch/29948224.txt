 Surgical equipment , and especially the so-called ` splash basins ' that are used intraoperatively , are a potential source of bacterial contamination in primary total hip arthroplasty ( THA). With this risk in mind , many commercially available draping kits include plastic bags that can be used to collect fluid or to temporarily store instruments. Following this rationale , we hypothesised that first: the fluid collection bags are a potential reservoir of bacteria and second: there is a time dependency for bacterial contamination. After ethics approval , we investigated in a prospective , internally controlled , non-blinded trial 43 patients who received primary THA. At the beginning of the surgery , we took deep , representative , intracapsular tissue samples , which served as negative controls. At the end of surgery , tissue samples were taken from the bottom of the ` fluid collection bag ' for microbiological analysis. All 86 control samples were negative. Out of the samples taken from the bags , a pathogen could be detected in four patients ( 9.3 %). All pathogens were detected after a surgery time lasting longer than 90 min. We were able to show that fluid collection bags are a potential reservoir for bacteria in THA when surgery time was greater than a 90-min threshold. Our data suggest that the risks from fluid collection bags outweigh the advantages of using them. Therefore , we recommend against the use of fluid collection bags intraoperatively in primary THA.
