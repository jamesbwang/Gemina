 Chemical investigation of the leaves and stems of the Chinese mangrove Acanthus ilicifolius Linn. led to the isolation and structure elucidation of one new pyrido ( 1,2-a) indole alkaloid named acanthiline A ( 1) , together with one known compound aurantiamide acetate ( 2). Compound 1 has a previously unreported natural product skeleton. The structure elucidation of 1 was based on the analysis of its 1D and 2D NMR and mass spectroscopic data.
