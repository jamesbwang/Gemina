 Longitudinal changes in compensatory and anticipatory postural adjustments around the knee were investigated from rupture of ACL until return to play after reconstruction. Twelve ACL-injured participants ( ACL-P) were asked to respond to unpredictable and predictable perturbations before ( T1) , 2 ( T2) and 6 months after ( T3) reconstruction. Twelve healthy participants served as controls. Compensatory and anticipatory latencies of vastus lateralis ( VL) and medialis ( VM) were measured with respect to the arrival of perturbations. ACL-P showed delayed compensatory latencies compared to controls at T1 for VL ( 101 ± 32 ms vs 63 ± 7 ms) and VM ( 117 ± 36 ms vs 75 ± 17 ms) and at T2 for VL ( 94 ± 20 ms vs 63 ± 7 ms) and VM ( 94 ± 27 ms vs 71 ± 11 ms). ACL-P showed earlier anticipatory latencies than controls for VL at T1 ( -69 ± 44 ms vs -12 ± 12 ms) and T2 ( -46 ± 17 ms vs -16 ± 12 ms). At T3 , ACL-P showed delayed compensatory latencies for VL ( 91 ± 18 ms vs 56 ± 21 ms) and VM ( 95 ± 13 ms vs 66 ± 4 ms) , whilst anticipatory latencies were restored. Rehabilitation should address delayed compensatory responses.
