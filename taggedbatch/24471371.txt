 Behavioral economic models predict that deficits in substance-free reward and future time orientation are associated with greater drug involvement , but this hypothesis has not been systematically investigated among young adult heavy drinkers. This study evaluated the association between drug use levels ( heavy drinking ( HD) only , HD + marijuana use , and HD + polysubstance use) and substance-free activity engagement , future orientation , and reward deprivation ( comprised of reward experience and environmental suppressors of reward) among heavy drinkers. Participants were 358 college students who reported two or more past-month heavy drinking episodes ( 5/4 or more drinks in one occasion for a man/woman). The sample was 60 % women , 79 % Caucasian , and the average age was 18.76 ( Overall , any drug use was associated with less time spent engaged in academics and exercise , and lower future time orientation compared to HD only. Any drug use was associated with reward deprivation and HD + polysubstance use was associated with lower reward experience and environmental suppressors. Drug use among heavy drinkers is associated with lower academic engagement and exercise , future orientation , and reward deprivation. These results provide support for behavioral economic models of drug abuse and suggest that prevention approaches should attempt to increase future orientation and availability of drug-free reward.
