 Cerebral ischemia is a major cause of death and neurological disability. It also leads to severe brain tissue damage by excessive generation of oxidative stress. Quercetin is a bioflavonoid substance that acts an antioxidant agent and exerts a neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia. The aim of this study was to detect specific proteins that are differentially expressed in response to quercetin treatment in focal cerebral ischemia. Adult male rats were intraperitoneally injected with vehicle or quercetin ( 10 mg/kg) 30 min prior to right middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO). Brain tissues were collected 24 h after MCAO surgery and right cerebral cortices proteins were identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. MCAO leads to neurological behavior disorders , infarction , and histopathological change. However , quercetin treatment alleviated MCAO-induced neuronal deficits and damages. We identified specific proteins differentially expressed between vehicle- and quercetin-treated animals. Among these detected proteins , isocitrate dehydrogenase ( NAD
