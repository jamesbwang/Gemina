 The collected data have revealed the beneficial effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4) inhibitors on the vascular endothelium , including vildagliptin. However , the involved mechanisms are not yet clear. In this study , Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the following four groups: control , diabetic , diabetic + low-dose vildagliptin ( 10 mg/kg/d) , and diabetic + high-dose vildagliptin ( 20 mg/kg/d). The diabetic model was created by feeding a high-fat diet for four weeks and injection of streptozotocin. Then , vildagliptin groups were given oral vildagliptin for twelve weeks , and the control and diabetic groups were given the same volume of saline. The metabolic parameters , endothelial function , and whole genome expression in the aorta were examined. After 12 weeks of treatment , vildagliptin groups showed significantly reduced blood glucose , blood total cholesterol , and attenuated endothelial dysfunction. Notably , vildagliptin may inhibit angiopoietin-like 3
