 A chief goal of systems biology is the reconstruction of large-scale executable models of cellular processes of interest. While accurate continuous models are still beyond reach , a powerful alternative is to learn a logical model of the processes under study , which predicts the logical state of any node of the model as a Boolean function of its incoming nodes. Key to learning such models is the functional annotation of the underlying physical interactions with activation/repression ( sign) effects. Such annotations are pretty common for a few well-studied biological pathways. Here we present a novel optimization framework for large-scale sign annotation that employs different plausible models of signaling and combines them in a rigorous manner. We apply our framework to two large-scale knockout datasets in yeast and evaluate its different components as well as the combined model to predict signs of different subsets of physical interactions. Overall , we obtain an accurate predictor that outperforms previous work by a considerable margin. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/spatkar94/NetworkAnnotation.git.
