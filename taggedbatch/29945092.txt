 analyze the effect of zoledronic acid ( ZA) alone and in combination with epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG) on human osteoblast cells. SAOS-2 osteoblastic phenotype cell line treated with different doses ( 0.01-10 μM) of ZA or ZA + EGCG underwent cell viability , mineralization , collagen synthesis and cell migration tests. Micromolar ( 1 and 5 μM) doses of ZA reduced cell viability ( p < 0.001) , mineralization ( p < 0.001) , and collagen synthesis ( p < 0.001) , while nanomolar doses ( 0.1 μM) did not produce any effect. EGCG application partly reversed the inhibition produced by ZA , and even increased mineralization ( p < 0.001). the data obtained shows that ZA at micromolar doses produces negative effects on osteoblast at all parameters measured , while at nanomolar levels ZA only affected cell migration and had no other effects on osteoblasts. The addition of EGCG partly reversed the effects produced by ZA , suggesting that this might be a promising preventative measure against BRONJ.
