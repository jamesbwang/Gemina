 To improve stroke awareness and reduce life-threatening prehospital delays worldwide , a universal stroke educational program is needed. To meet this unmet need , we developed a universal program without language barriers and tested its acceptance in Taiwan , where Chinese is the native language. Stroke 112 was developed using the universal emergency phone number , 112. The numbers imply an emergency and correspond to the 3 stroke recognition signs used in FAST ( Face , Arm , Speech , and Time): 1 uneven face ( crooked mouth<symptom>); 1 weak arm ( arm<symptom> weakness<symptom>); 2 incoherent lips ( slurred<symptom> speech<symptom>). An online survey was used to determine the acceptance of the Stroke 112 program compared with that of FAST in Chinese. The surveys were delivered using SurveyMonkey ( http://www.surveymonkey.com) on 2 separate occasions in Taiwan; in August 2017 for an initial estimation of the acceptance of Stroke 112 and in March 2018 , 2 weeks after the official release of Stroke 112 in Taiwan , including a special introductory lecture for neurologists hosted by the STARS-Taiwan ( Stroke Treatment and Research Society-Taiwan). The initial survey with 465 survey responders , 54.6 % thought that Stroke 112 was easier to remember for people in Taiwan compared with FAST ( 41.2 %). After Stroke 112 's official release in Taiwan , 610 individuals completed the survey , and the majority ( 66.4 %) thought that Stroke 112 was easier to remember , a significant increase compared with the initial survey ( Stroke 112 , a universal stroke educational program without language barriers was developed. It could potentially be implemented worldwide , especially where 112 is used as an emergency phone number.
