 The generalization of successful efforts for reducing time delays in intravenous thrombolysis ( IVT) could help facilitate its utility and benefits in acute ischemic stroke ( AIS) patients.We searched the PubMed and Embase databases for articles reporting interventions to reduce time delays in IVT , published between January 1995 and September 2017. The IVT rate was chosen as the primary outcome , while the compliance rates of onset-to-door time ( prehospital delay) and door-to-needle time ( in-hospital delay) within the targeted time frame were the secondary outcomes. Interventions designed to reduce prehospital , in-hospital , or total time delays were quantitatively described in meta-analyses. The efficacy of postintervention improvement was illustrated as odds ratios ( ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CIs). In total , 86 papers ( 17 on prehospital , 56 on in-hospital , and 13 on total delay) encompassing 17,665 IVT cases were enrolled , including 28 American , 23 Asian , 30 European , and 5 Australian studies. The meta-analysis revealed statistically significant improvement in promoting IVT delivery after prehospital improvement interventions with an OR of 1.45 ( 95 % CI , 1.23-1.71) for the new transportation protocol , 1.38 ( 95 % CI , 1.11-1.73) for educational and training programs , and 1.83 ( 95 % CI , 1.44-2.32) for comprehensive prehospital stroke code. The benefits of reducing in-hospital delay were much greater in developed western countries than in Asian countries , with ORs of 2.90 ( 95 % CI , 2.51-3.34) , 2.17 ( 95 % CI , 1.95-2.41) , and 1.89 ( 95 % CI , 1.74-2.04) in American , European , and Asian countries , respectively. And telemedicine ( OR , 2.26; 95 % CI , 2.08-2.46) seemed to work better than pre-notification alone ( OR , 1.94; 95 % CI , 1.74-2.17) and in-hospital organizational improvement programs ( OR , 2.10; 95 % CI , 1.97-2.23). Mobile stroke treatment unit and use of a comprehensive stroke pathway in the pre- and in-hospital settings significantly increased IVT rates by reducing total time delay , with ORs of 2.01 ( 95 % CI , 1.60-2.51) and 1.77 ( 95 % CI , 1.55-2.03) , respectively.Optimization of the work flow with organizational improvement or novel technology could dramatically reduce pre- and in-hospital time delays of IVT in AIS. This study provided detailed information on the net and quantitative benefits of various programs for reducing time delays to facilitate the generalization of appropriate AIS management.
