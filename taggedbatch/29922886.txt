 To clarify whether there are different expressions between lung cancer and benign pulmonary diseases , we studied seven microRNAs ( miRNAs) in serum from patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) , benign pulmonary nodules<symptom> and four pulmonary<symptom> inflammation<symptom> diseases. We detected the expression of miRNAs using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR). We found that five miRNA ratios-miR-15b-5p/ miR-146b-3p , miR-20a-5p/ miR-146b-3p , miR-19a-3p/ miR-146b-3p , miR-92a-3p/ miR-146b-3p , and miR-16-5p/ miR-146b-3p-show higher expression in the NSCLC group than the benign pulmonary nodule<disease> group , and 13 ratios of miRNAs were significantly upregulated in the NSCLC group compared with the pulmonary<symptom> inflammation<symptom> diseases group. Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis was performed. For NSCLC and benign pulmonary nodules<symptom> , the sensitivity and specificity were 0.70 and 0.90 , respectively. For NSCLC and pulmonary<symptom> inflammation<symptom> diseases , the sensitivity and specificity were 0.81 and 0.71 , respectively. The ratios of miRNAs can be used as potential non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosis of early-stage NSCLC and benign pulmonary diseases.
