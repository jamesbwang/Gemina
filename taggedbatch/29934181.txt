 Amaranth species are globally grown food crops. However , knowledge about the composition of their secondary metabolites is insufficient. Here , selected hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives , flavonoid glycosides , carotenoids and chlorophylls in the leaves of 14 genotypes from six different amaranth species were identified and quantified. For the first time , caffeic acid esters of isocitric and several aldaric acids were isolated and quantified in a leafy food matrix. High concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and chlorophylls , and moderate amounts of flavonoids and carotenoids were detected. A hierarchical clustering method of the metabolic profiles followed by Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA ( RAPD)- PCR fingerprinting was used to group the genotypes. Using this combined approach , three main groups of amaranth species were assigned. The information provided in this study increases the attractiveness of the amaranth genus as a food crop due to its strong diversity of plant secondary metabolites that are associated with numerous health-promoting benefits.
