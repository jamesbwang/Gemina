 To investigate whether complete mesocolic excision ( CME) might carry a higher risk of bowel dysfunction and subsequent reduction in quality of life compared with conventional resection. A cross-sectional questionnaire study based on data from a national survey regarding long-term bowel function and a population-based cohort study comparing CME ( study group) with conventional resection ( control group). A total of 622 patients undergoing elective resection for Stage I-III sigmoid adenocarcinoma at four university colorectal centres between June 2008 and December 2014 were eligible to receive the questionnaire in mid-November 2015. Primary outcomes were four or more bowel movements daily , nocturnal bowel movements , unproductive call to stool<symptom> , obstructive sensation and impact of bowel function on quality of life ( QOL). One hundred and twenty-seven ( 69.0 %) and 289 ( 66.0 %) patients in the study and control groups , respectively , responded to the questionnaire after medians of 4.41 ( interquartile range ( IQR) 2.50 , 5.83) and 4.57 ( IQR 3.15 , 5.82) years , respectively ( P = 0.048). CME was not associated with: increased risk of four or more bowel movements daily ( adjusted OR 1.14 ( 95 % CI 0.59-2.14; P = 0.68)) , nocturnal bowel movements ( adjusted OR 1.31 ( 0.66-2.53; P = 0.43)) , unproductive call to stool<symptom> ( adjusted OR 0.99 ( 0.54-1.77; P = 0.97)) or obstructive sensation ( adjusted OR 1.01 ( 0.56-1.78; P = 0.96)). While one in five patients in both groups had moderate<symptom> to severe impact of bowel function on QOL , there was no association with CME. For patients with sigmoid cancer , CME is associated with neither higher risk of bowel dysfunction nor impaired QOL.
