 The present study aims to evaluate the Three-Dimensional Diffusion-Weighted reversed fast imaging with steady state free precession ( 3D DW-PSIF) sequence with respect to imaging of the peripheral nerves; the tibial , medial , and lateral plantar nerves in the lower extremity , ulnar and median nerve in the upper extremity , sciatic nerve , brachial plexus , and lumbosacral plexus , and also to compare its usefulness with the current two-dimensional sequences on a 1.5 T MR scanner. A total of 25 healthy subjects underwent MR imaging of peripheral nerves , 5 subjects in each area. In each imaging sequence , including T2W SPAIR and 3D DW-PSIF , images were evaluated for ability to identify the nerves in the related area using a 3-score scale ( 0-2). Then , by summing up the conspicuity scores , a total certainty score was recorded for each sequence. With combining the results of all studies , the conspicuity mean ( SD) score was 1.57 ( 0.67) on the 3D DW-PSIF images , and 0.74 ( 0.76) on the T2-weighted images ( P < 0.001). Regarding the lumbosacral plexus , the corresponding certainty mean ( SD) scores were 1.80 ( 0.40) and 1.07 ( 0.74) ( P < 0.001) and with regard to the brachial plexus , they were 1.23 ( 0.83) and 0.75 ( 0.84) , ( P < 0.001). Regarding the ankle/hind foot they were 1.87 ( 0.35) and 0.40 ( 0.50) ( P < 0.001) and in the wrist/proximal hand , 1.70 ( 0.48) and 0.50 ( 0.52) ( P < 0.001). Regarding the sciatic nerve , they were 1.80 ( 0.44) and 0.20 ( 0.44) ( P = 0.003). 3D DW PSIF provides better manifestation of nerves compared to routine imaging sequences particularly fat saturated T2W images. This novel imaging technique can be used in MR neurography examination protocol for exact localization of the nerve and evaluation of the nerve pathology.
