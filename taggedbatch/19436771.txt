 This prospective study explored longitudinal , bidirectional associations between eating pathology and perceptions of the parent-child relationship ( i.e. , parent-child regard and involvement) across adolescence. Specifically , this study examined whether twin differences in mother-daughter and father-daughter relationship problems emerged as a risk factor for , or outcome of , twin differences in eating pathology. By examining twin differences , this study explored associations between variables while controlling for shared environmental and genetic effects. A population-based sample of 446 monozygotic twin girls and their mothers completed questionnaires when twins were approximately 11 , 14 , and 17 years. Responses were analyzed using longitudinal cross-lagged models. Overall , few strong longitudinal associations were observed. Where longitudinal associations emerged , overall patterns indicated reciprocal associations that shifted across adolescence. Whereas twin differences in parent-daughter relationship variables more often predicted later twin differences in eating pathology across early adolescence , conversely , twin differences in eating pathology more often predicted later twin differences in parent-daughter relationship variables across later adolescence. In particular , the twin who reported greater eating pathology later reported more negative perceptions of the father-daughter relationship , as compared to her co-twin. Findings raise questions for future research regarding parental-in particular , paternal-responses to adolescent eating pathology and suggest the potential importance of efforts to support the parent-daughter relationship within the context of adolescent eating pathology.
