 Guppy ( Poecilia reticulata) is a promising model organism in toxicological studies , and vitellogenin ( Vtg) is a commonly used biomarker for environmental estrogens. Although an ELISA for guppy Vtg has been developed previously , we found that guppy had two forms of Vtgs. In this study , two Vtgs were characterized and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISAs) for each Vtg were developed. Two Vtgs purified from 17Î²-estradiol ( E
