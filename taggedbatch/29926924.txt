 We examined whether potential help givers ' future time perspective ( FTP) accounts for the decision to give a person in need dependency-oriented help ( i.e. , providing the complete solution) or autonomy-oriented help ( i.e. , providing the means to solve a problem). In addition , building on past research on the effects of empathy in help giving decisions , the present research explored whether helpers ' willingness to offer specific type of help is predicted by the interaction between FTP and interpersonal empathy. We explored FTP as both a personal predisposition ( Study 1) and an experimentally induced state of mind ( Study 2). The present research provides a novel perspective on theory and research on help giving behaviour , FTP , and empathy , by showing that when interpersonal empathy is high , considerations of the future predict readiness to give help that promotes person 's present and future independent coping rather than help that creates and preserves social dependence.
