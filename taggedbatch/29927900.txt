 Curative treatments for hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) can alter the course of a devastating epidemic , but high drug prices have contributed to restrictions on HCV<pathogen> treatment access. We aimed to learn how state health agencies have responded to the challenges of treatment access for HCV<pathogen>. Qualitative study using semistructured key informant interviews focused on aspects of HCV<pathogen> treatment access between June 2016 and March 2017. Content analysis was used to identify dominant themes. United States. Eighteen health officials and treatment advocates across 6 states selected using purposive sampling. Drug pricing is the most important barrier to access , encouraging restrictive authorization criteria from payers that in turn discourage providers from offering treatment. However , payers have not experienced the budget impact that was initially feared. Although authorization criteria are being lifted for fee-for-service Medicaid programs , ensuring that managed care organizations follow suit remains a challenge. The effect of stigma , a shortage of treating providers , and lack of political motivation are additional challenges to expanding treatment. The response to the human<pathogen><disease> immunodeficiency<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> epidemic can augment or inform strategies for HCV<pathogen> treatment delivery , but this is limited by the absence of dedicated funding. While treatment eligibility criteria for HCV<pathogen> treatment are improving , many other barriers remain to achieving the scale-up needed to end the epidemic. Political disinterest , stigma , and a lack of specialty providers are continued barriers in some jurisdictions. States may need to invest in strategies to overcome these barriers , such as engaging in public and provider education and ensuring that treatment by primary care providers is reimbursed. Despite uncertainty about how federal policy changes to Medicaid may affect states ' ability to respond , states can identify opportunities to improve access.
