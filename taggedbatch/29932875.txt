 Study Design Phenomenographic , cross-sectional. Background Adolescent athletes struggle to return to sport ( RTS) following ACL reconstruction ( ACLR) for a number of physical and psychosocial reasons. The ability to incorporate contextual evidence obtained directly from patients with the growing body of quantitative rehabilitation research may aid clinicians in taking an evidence-based approach to rehabilitation and return to sports within the adolescent population.. Objectives To assess perceived barriers to RTS as well as positive and negative factors influencing recovery among high school athletes with recent history of ACLR. Methods Ten high school-aged individuals ( 6 female , 4 male; age = 16.8 ± 1.1 years , time since surgery = 5.5 ± 1.4 mo.) who underwent ACLR and had not RTS were enrolled. Participants completed a semi-structured interview focused on attitudes related to RTS , perceived physical or psychosocial barriers to PA and RTS , and rehabilitation characteristics that may facilitate or hinder RTS. Results Participants reported psychosocial barriers to RTS with greater consistency then physical barriers. Consistently reported barriers included the feeling that sport-based activities were now associated with injury , a persistent sense of uncertainty regarding full recovery , and that social comparison to others with ACLR by parents or coaches was hindering their ability to make progress in rehabilitation. Conclusions Early identification of athletes at risk for persistent psychosocial barriers such as fear of re-injury and uncertainty regarding full recovery , and establishment of peer mentoring groups to facilitate psychosocial support throughout the rehabilitation process may be key components of a gradual and patient-centered approach to improving mental and physical readiness for RTS.
