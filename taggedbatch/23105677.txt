 Lung adenocarcinoma ( LAC) accounts for more than a half of non-small cell lung cancer with high morbidity and mortality. Progression of treatment has not accelerated the improvement of its prognosis. Hence , it is an urgent need to develop novel biomarkers for its early diagnosis and treatment. In this study , we proposed to identify LAC survival-related genes through comprehensive analysis of large-scale gene expression profiles. LAC gene expression data sets were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA). Identification of differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) in LAC compared with adjacent normal lung tissues was first performed followed by univariate Cox regression analysis to obtain genes that are significantly associated with LAC survival ( SurGenes). Then , we conducted sure independence screening ( SIS) for SurGenes to identify more reliable genes and the prognostic signature for LAC survival prediction. Another two lung cancer data sets from TCGA and Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO) were used for the validation of prognostic signature. A total of 20 genes were obtained , which were significantly associated with the overall survival ( OS) of LAC patients. The prognostic signature , a weighted linear combination of the 20 genes , could successfully separate LAC samples with high OS from those with low OS and had robust predictive performance for survival ( training set: The prognostic signature combined with multi-gene expression profiles provides a moderate OS prediction for LAC and should be helpful for appropriate treatment method selection.
