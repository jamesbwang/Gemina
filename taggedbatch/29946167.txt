 Metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 ( mGlu2) belongs to the group-II metabotropic glutamate ( mGlu) receptors and is a neurotransmitter G protein-coupled receptor. The group-II mGlu receptors are promising antipsychotic targets , but the specific role of mGlu2 signaling remains unclear. Receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs) are also believed to participate in brain pathogenesis. To investigate whether there is any communication between mGlu2 and RTKs , we generated a CHO-mGlu2 cell line that stably expresses mGlu2 and showed that activation of mGlu2 by LY379268 , a group II mGlu agonist , was able to transactivate insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor ( IGF-1R). We further determined that the G
