 This editorial describes a patient who was cared for by the author. The patient developed end-stage kidney disease in the United States at the age of 17 but was denied kidney transplantation due to lack of insurance because of her immigration status. With the enactment of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA) program , the patient was able to obtain a job and health insurance. The patient then received a kidney transplant when she was 27 years , after undergoing peritoneal dialysis for 10 years. The editorial describes how the DACA program improves the care of undocumented immigrants to the United States who are affected by kidney disease. While many might consider kidney transplantation to be available to all individuals in the United States , this is not the case. Individuals who are not US citizens are for practical purposes unable to undergo transplantation in almost all states because of their inability to obtain health insurance. This editorial describes the history of one of my patients , and the profound impact that the DACA program ( Dreamer Act) had on her care. This legislation is currently under review for continued approval in the United States legislature. I am happy to see my patient in clinic today for medical care following successful kidney transplantation.
