 In the tradition of phenomenology , minimal selfdisturbance has been suggested as a manifestation of the core pathogenesis of schizophrenia; however , the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Here , in line with the concept of `` cognitive dysmetria , '' we investigated the cerebro-cerebellar default mode network ( DMN) connectivity and its association with pre-reflective minimal selfdisturbance in individuals at ultra-high risk ( UHR) for psychosis and patients with first-episode schizophrenia ( FES). Thirty-three UHR individuals , 18 FES patients , and 56 healthy controls ( HCs) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during rest at baseline. Seed-based functional connectivity ( FC) analysis was performed using the cerebellar DMN seeds from the bilateral Crus I , followed by between-group comparisons. Correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between the cerebro-cerebellar FC and the self-reported severity of minimal self-disturbance in the UHR and FES groups , respectively. FES participants showed significantly reduced cerebellar FC with the left presupplementary motor area ( preSMA) , right anterior prefrontal cortex ( aPFC) , and precuneus compared to HCs , while UHR participants showed an intermediate decrease between the other two groups , particularly in the left preSMA and right aPFC. Minimal self-disturbance , which appeared at similar levels in both UHR and FES groups , was significantly associated with cerebro-cerebellar FC , although each group presented different patterns of associations. Aberrant cerebro-cerebellar FC , which may be closely related to minimal self-disturbance , may be able to provide meaningful insights into the real gestalt of schizophrenia and contribute to further research to predict future psychosis in UHR individuals.
