 Sacroiliac joint ( SIJ) pain has been identified as a primary or contributing source of pain in patients with low<symptom> back pain. The Laslett cluster of SIJ pain provocation tests has the strongest evidence for noninvasive clinical testing. The purpose of this report was to describe the impact of physical therapy treatments for a patient postpartum with SIJ pain who satisfied the Laslett cluster. Specifically , the goal was to assess the impact of progressive pelvic floor muscle exercise and manual therapy. The Modified Oswestry Low<symptom> Back<symptom> Pain<symptom> Disability Questionnaire ( MODI) was the primary outcome measure used in this case. In addition , the Numeric Pain Rating Scale ( NRPS) and Global Rating of Change ( GROC) were used as secondary outcome measures. In this case report , the patient responded to the combined interventions with decreases in MODI , NRPS and GROC. Further research is warranted to develop stronger evidence to identify specific interventions for the treatment of SIJ pain.
