 UDP-glucuronosyltransferases ( UGTs) are drug-metabolizing enzymes essential for the metabolism of endogenous substrates and xenobiotics. Molecular characteristics of UGTs have been extensively investigated in humans , but in cynomolgus macaques , a non-human primate species widely used in drug metabolism studies , remain to be investigated. In this study , 12 UGT1A cDNAs ( UGT1A1 , 1A2 , 1A4A , 1A4B , 1A5A , 1A5B , 1A5C , 1A6 , 1A7 , 1A8 , 1A9 , and 1A10) were isolated and characterized in cynomolgus macaques. UGT1A5C cDNA did not contain a complete coding region due to nonsense mutations , and was excluded from further analysis. Amino acid sequences of all 11 cynomolgus UGT1As had high sequence identities ( 92-95 %) with human UGT1As and were phylogenetically close to human UGT1As. These cynomolgus UGT1A genes shared exons 2-5 , and contained a variable exon 1 unique to each gene , similar to human UGT1A genes. Moreover , cynomolgus and human UGT1A gene clusters were located in corresponding regions in the genome. Among the 10 tissue types analyzed , cynomolgus UGT1A mRNAs were most abundantly expressed in the liver , jejunum<symptom> , and/or kidney , the drug-metabolizing organs , similar to human UGT1As. Among these 11 cynomolgus UGT1A mRNAs , cynomolgus UGT1A2 , UGT1A9 , and UGT1A10 mRNAs were most abundantly expressed in the liver , kidney , and jejunum<symptom> , respectively. Cynomolgus liver microsomes and UGT1A proteins catalyzed glucuronidation of the substrates human UGT1As catalyze , including 4-methylumbelliferone , 4-nitrophenol , estradiol , trifluoperazine , serotonin , and propofol , although trifluoperazine glucuronidation was not catalyzed by any cynomolgus UGT1A proteins. These results suggest that cynomolgus UGT1As are functional enzymes with molecular similarities to human UGT1As.
