 Femoroacetabular impingement ( FAI) is a common cause of hip<symptom> joint dysfunction and pain in adults aged between 30-60 years. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the short term clinical outcome of hip arthroscopy in patients diagnosed with FAI. A total of 105 patients were studied. This minimal invasive technique has shown to be highly effective in comparison to open surgery in young patients.
