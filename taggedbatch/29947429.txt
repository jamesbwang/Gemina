 Due to the continued shortage of public health nurses , some local public health agencies have begun hiring new graduate baccalaureate nurses into the public health nurse role. These new graduates require an increased level of support for transition to practice. The goal of this project was creation of a transition to practice program designed specifically to meet the needs of new graduates hired in public health settings. The core competencies of public health nursing were used as a framework to develop this residency program. A group of public health staff , supervisors , and faculty met monthly for three years to develop this program. Key features include general orientation , preceptors , looping experiences , case studies and peer support. The program is available as a web resource beginning spring 2018. In order to evaluate this program , data on job satisfaction , employee retention and level of competence in the core competencies of public health will occur using instruments administered prior to beginning and immediately following completion of the new graduate residency. The components of the program mirror best practices for new graduate residencies and are based on core competencies for public health nursing. This residency program is an important step for enhancing the professional development of new baccalaureate graduates in public health settings , and preparing the next generation of public health nurses. Through the increased support and intentional education of the residency program , public health agencies will be able to attract and retain new graduates who develop the essential knowledge and skills to provide safe and effective care in the public health setting.
