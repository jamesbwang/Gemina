 We aimed to assess the accuracy of self-assessment for acute stroke patients via mobile phone application-based scales and determine the value and prospect of clinical use.A cross-sectional study was designed and acute stroke patients were enrolled. We pushed the modified Rankin scale ( mRS) and activities of daily living ( ADL) scale to patients via mobile phone application for self-assessment on the day before they were out of hospital. We compared the results from nurse assessment and self-assessment. Around 50 patients with the average age 51.72 Â± 12.40 completed the self-assessment. A total of 27 patients self-assessed the scales , while caregivers of other 23 patients completed the assessment. In comparison with patient assessment and nurse assessment , significant difference was found in ADL score ( P = .004) , but was not found in mRS score ( P > .05). When comparing caregiver assessment with nurse assessment , no significant difference could be found either in ADL score ( P > .05) or in mRS score ( P > .05). The kappa value for self-assessment and nurse agreement of ADL was 0.720 ( P = .000) , with sensitivity 96.8 % and specificity 82.0 %. The kappa value for self-assessment and nurse agreement of mRS was 0.718 ( P = .000) , with sensitivity 97.6 % and specificity 92.4 %. In summary , mobile phone application-based scales are generally accurate , economical and convenient for self-assessment of acute stroke patients with acceptable reliability in our small scale study. Caregivers can serve as the proper assessor when patients are out of hospital. Therefore , it is promising but still need to be further confirmed how practical to use this application in extended care and follow-up.
