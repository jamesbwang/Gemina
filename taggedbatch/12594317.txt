 Informed consent is a systematic process for obtaining permission before conducting a healthcare intervention. In a developing country , gaining informed consent is generally perceived to be a ritual only to comply with legal requirements. The present study examined this by assessing the process of informed consent in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery or living donor liver transplantation ( LDLT) and their relatives , based on their comprehension and overall satisfaction , in India. All patients undergoing any gastrointestinal surgery or LDLT procedure between August 2015 and July 2016 and their relatives were included , and were administered a structured questionnaire 5 days after the procedure. The majority of patients ( 94 · 2 per cent) could recall the nature of their disease , the surgery performed ( 81 · 6 per cent) and anticipated complications ( 55 · 6 per cent). Among their relatives , these proportions were 97 · 8 , 87 · 3 and 58 · 5 per cent respectively. Recall was associated with age , occupation and education among both patients and relatives. Patients undergoing LDLT , their donors and their relatives had better recall than those who had other gastrointestinal procedures ( P < 0 · 001). Many patients found the process of informed consent useful and reassuring. The details and risks of an operation were understood by most of the patients , especially those undergoing liver transplantation. Patients from developing countries can generally understand ` informed consent ' , and value it.
