 The relationship of Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection with periodontitis<disease> was examined. The study subjects were 686 individuals ( males 504 , females 182; mean age 53.8 years) who underwent a screening test for periodontitis<disease> between April 2015 and March 2018 and whose H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection status could be determined. The periodontitis<disease> test was performed by examining saliva concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase and hemoglobin ( Hb) , with a lactate dehydrogenase level ≥ 350 U/L and/or hemoglobin level ≥ 2 μg/mL defined as positive for periodontitis<disease>. Among subjects found positive in screening for periodontitis<disease> , those classified as negative and positive for H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection , as well as post-eradicated were 81 ( 39.7 %) , 30 ( 14.7 %) , and 93 ( 45.6 %) , respectively , while those among subjects shown negative for periodontitis<disease> numbered 241 ( 50.0 %) , 52 ( 10.8 %) , and 189 ( 39.2 %) , respectively. Subjects noted as negative , positive , and post-eradicated for H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection comprised 25.2 % , 36.6 % , and 32.9 % , respectively , of all shown positive for periodontitis<disease>. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the risk for positive in the periodontitis<disease> test was higher among subjects with H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection as compared with those without , while post-eradicated status tended to reduce that risk. Repeated examinations performed following H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication showed that the number of subjects positive for periodontitis<disease> was decreased among those who underwent successful eradication. Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection increases the risk for occurrence of periodontitis<disease> , which can be reduced by successful eradication.
