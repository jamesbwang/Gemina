 Recent research was conducted to evaluate the healing efficiency of bacterial cellulose ( BC) as a wound<disease><symptom> dressing in different pHs and its possibility of being a smart wound<disease><symptom> dressing that can indicate pHs. BC was produced by environmentally isolated bacterial strains. After washing the best achieved BC , it was floated in normal saline with different pHs with phenol red used as a pH indicator. Finally the wound<disease><symptom> healing effects of the acidic , neutral and alkaline BC membranes<symptom> were evaluated in rat cutaneous<disease> wounds<disease><symptom>. Results showed that one of the isolates which its partial 16srRNA genome had 95 % similarity with Gluconacetobacter intermedius<pathogen> , had the thickest layer. The microscopic and macroscopic evaluations showed that the acidic BC had the best healing activity. Although the color of the films remained unchanged during the experiments because they were transparent and thin , these changes could not be easily seen. This suggests the use of thicker films such as the ones which are cross linked with some materials ( e.g. , sterile gauze). In conclusion the pH can affect the healing ability of natural BC and acidic pH had the best wound<disease><symptom> healing efficiency. In future it is better to use the acidic BC instead of natural one for different wound<disease><symptom> healing purposes.
