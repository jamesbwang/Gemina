 The available evidence on interventions addressing the stigma of mental illness is limited because of small samples , lack of diversity in study samples , and exclusion of people living with mental illness. To date , no published studies have evaluated anti-stigma interventions for Asian men in Canada. Aim This paper describes the protocol of a study to evaluate psychological and collective empowerment interventions ( ACT , CEE , and ACT+CEE) in addressing self-stigma and social stigma in Asian communities in three urban settings in Canada: Toronto , Calgary and Vancouver. The study targets Asian men living with or affected by mental illness , and community leaders interested in stigma reduction and advocacy. Guided by a population health promotion framework and an ecological approach to health , the study will use a repeated measure design with mixed methods for data collection. In total , 2160 participants will be enrolled to detect moderate-to-large effect sizes , while accounting for possible attrition. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three interventions or a control group , using a randomization matrix. Established measures will be used to collect outcome data at pretest , post-test , and 3 and 6 months follow-up , along with focus group discussions and monthly activity logs. Mixed linear models will compare participants ' stigma , psychological flexibility , valued life domains , mindfulness , and empowerment readiness within and between groups. The project will generate new knowledge on the applicability and effectiveness of evidence-based psychological and collective empowerment interventions ( ACT , CEE , and ACT+CEE) in addressing stigma of mental illness and mobilizing community leadership.
