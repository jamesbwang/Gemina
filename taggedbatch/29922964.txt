 Immune cells are present in the adipose tissue ( AT) and regulate its function. Under lean conditions , immune cells predominantly of type 2 immunity , including eosinophils , M2-like anti-inflammatory macrophages and innate lymphoid cells 2 , contribute to the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis within the AT. In the course of obesity , pro-inflammatory immune cells , such as M1-like macrophages , prevail in the AT. Inflammation<symptom> in the obese AT is associated with the development of metabolic complications such as insulin resistance , type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Thus , the immune cell-adipocyte crosstalk in the AT is an important regulator of AT function and systemic metabolism. We discuss herein this crosstalk with a special focus on the role of innate immune cells in AT inflammation<symptom> and metabolic homeostasis in obesity.
