 To investigate the effects of arsenic trioxide ( As The proliferation of HL-60 cells was detected by CCK-8 method at different concentrations of arsenic trioxide for 24 , 48 and 72 hours. The cell morphological changes were observed by inverted microscopy. The expressions of Mad2 and Cdc20 mRNA and protein in HL-60 cells treated with As Arsenic trioxide significantly inhibited the HL-60 cell proliferation and displayed a good time-dose correlation. RT-PCR and Western blot showed that the expression of Mad2 was up-regulated and the expression of Cdc20 was down-regulated in HL-60 cells treated with arsenic trioxide of different concentration ( 4,8,10 Âµmol/L). Arsenic trioxide can inhibit the human acute myeloid leukemia<disease> HL-60 cell proliferation , and its mechanism may be related with up-regulation of Mad2 expression and down-regulation of Cdc20 expression.
