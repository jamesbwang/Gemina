 Ebola<disease> virus ( EBOV<pathogen>) enters host cells by macropinocytosis , a poorly understood process. Recent studies have suggested that cell factors involved in autophagy , an evolutionally conserved pathway leading to the lysosomal degradation of protein aggregates and organelles during cellular stress , also have roles in macropinocytosis. Here , we demonstrate that autophagy-associated proteins are required for trafficking of EBOV<pathogen> into the cell body. Depleting cells of beclin 1 , autophagy-related protein 7 , or microtubule-associated protein 1A/B light chain 3B ( LC3B) abolished EBOV<pathogen> uptake , owing to a block in vesicle formation at the cell surface. Both LC3B-I and LC3B-II interacted with macropinocytic structures. Our work indicates that , although various forms of LC3B possess an inherent ability to associate with forming macropinosomes , LC3B-II is critical for internalization of macropinocytic vesicles and , therefore , EBOV<pathogen> from the cell surface.
