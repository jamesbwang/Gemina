 Pediatric emergency visits for behavioral health complaints have been increasing for more than a decade. There are currently no best practices or ideal models of care. However , the evidence base for existing emergency department operational concepts can be used to implement modifications to workflow , care model , staffing , and physical environment to address patient needs. Rapid assessment , split flow , blended care model , multidisciplinary team development , mental health nursing triage , and staff training can all positively affect length of stay , staff safety , and patient satisfaction.
