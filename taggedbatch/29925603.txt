 Magnetic flux ropes are structures that are common in the corona of the sun and presumably all stars. They can be thought of as the building blocks of solar structures. They have been observed in Earth 's magnetotail and near Mars and Venus. When multiple flux ropes are present magnetic field line reconnection , which converts magnetic energy to other forms , can occur when they collide. The structure of multiple magnetic ropes , the interactions between multiple ropes , and their topological properties such as helicity and writhing have been studied theoretically and in laboratory experiments. Here , we report on spiky potential and magnetic fields associated with the ropes. We show that the potential structures are chaotic for a range of their temporal half-widths and the probability density function ( PDF) of their widths resembles the statistical distribution of crumpled paper. The spatial structure of the magnetic spikes is revealed using a correlation counting method. Computer simulation suggests that the potential structures are the nonlinear end result of an instability involving relative drift between ions and electrons.
