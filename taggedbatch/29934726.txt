 Vascular rings are congenital anomalies of the aortic arch , which may cause compression of the trachea and esophagus. Compression symptoms usually present in infants and children. Adult presentations are quite rare , and compression symptoms may not be relieved by surgical correction due to tracheal remodeling and malacia caused by a long-standing compression. Here , we present an adult case of symptomatic vascular ring formed by the right aortic arch and persistent left ligamentum arteriosus. Respiratory<symptom> symptoms<symptom> were predominantly due to severe tracheal stenosis caused by tracheal wall thickening through remodeling during long-standing compression , and were relieved by surgery with transection of the persistent followed by resection and reconstruction of the trachea.
