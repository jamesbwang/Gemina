 Several dental implants are commercially available and new prototype design are constantly being fabricated. Nevertheless , it is still unclear what parameters of the design affect most the osseointegration of dental implants. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of the microscopic and macroscopic design of dental implants in the osseointegration by comparing three macroscopic designs ( Straumann tissue level ( STD) , essential cone ( ECD) and prototype design ( PD)) and six surface treatments. A total of 96 implants were placed in 12 minipigs. The implant stability quotient ( ISQ) , was assessed at the time of implantation , as well as at 2 , 4 and 8 weeks. Histomorphometric and statistical analyses were conducted at the different sacrifice times , being 2 , 4 and 8 weeks , to analyse the bone to implant contact ( BIC) , the bone area density ( BAT) and the density of bone outside the thread region ( ROI). The macroscopic design results showed higher ISQ values for the ECD , whereas the histomorphometric analysis showed higher ossoeintegration values for the STD. Regarding the microscopic design , both Sandblasted plus acid etching ( hydrochloric/sulphuric acid) in a nitrogen atmosphere ( SLActive) and Shot-blasted or bombarded with alumina particles and posterior alkaline immersion and thermal treatment ( ContacTi) showed superior results in terms of osseointegration and reduced the osseointegration times from 8 weeks to 4 weeks compared to the other analysed surfaces. In conclusion , each of the macroscopic and microscopic designs need to be taken into account when designing novel dental implants to enhance the osseointegration process.
