 Many treatments of energy transfer ( ET) phenomena in current literature employ incorrect arguments and formulae and are not quantitative enough. This is unfortunate because we witness important breakthroughs from ET experiments in nanoscience. This review aims to clarify basic principles by focusing upon Förster-Dexter electric dipole-electric dipole ( ED-ED) ET. The roles of ET in upconversion , downconversion and the antenna effect are described and the clichés and simple formulae to be avoided in ET studies are highlighted with alternative treatments provided.
