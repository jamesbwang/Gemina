 Colon cancer is risen up with its complex mechanism that directly impacts on its treatment as well as its common prevalence. Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) have been considered as a therapeutic candidate for conventional disease including cancer. In this research , we have focused on apoptotic effects of adipose tissue-derived MSCs in colon cancer. MSCs were obtained from adipose tissue and characterized by Flowcytometer using suitable antibodies. MSCs , HT-29 , HCT-116 , RKO and healthy cell line MRC5 were cultured by different seeding procedure. After cell viability assay , changes in caspase 3 enzyme activity and the level of phosphatidylserine were measured. For cell viability assay , a 48 hr incubation period was chosen to seed all cells together. There was a 1.36-fold decrease in caspase 3 enzyme activity by co-treatment of RKO and MSCs in addition to 2.02-fold decrease in HT-29 and MSCs co-treatment , and 1.103-fold increase in HCT-116 and MSCs. The results demonstrated that HCT-116 led to the highest rate of apoptotic cell death ( 7.5 %) compared with other cells. We suggest that MSCs might remain a new treatment option for cancer by its differentiation and repair capacity.
