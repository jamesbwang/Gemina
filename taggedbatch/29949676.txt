 Lipases/acyltransferases , such as CpLIP2 from Candida<pathogen> parapsilosis<pathogen> and CduLAc from Candida<pathogen> dubliniensis<pathogen> catalyze preferentially acyltransfer over hydrolysis when a suitable nucleophile is present , even in medium with a high thermodynamic activity of water ( aW). They are related to CAL-A from Moesziomyces antarcticus , which in comparison displays a lower acyltransfer ability. The 3D structures of wild-types and mutants of CAL-A , CpLIP2 and CduLAc revealed differences in size and hydrophobicity of a large pocket located under the catalytic triad. The kinetic behavior of site-directed mutants confirmed the role of this pocket in the competition between methanol and water as the nucleophile acceptor for the deacylation step. The mutations provided a better understanding of key structural determinants for the variable levels of acyltransferase ability observed and supported the existence of a complex network of nucleophile interactions within the enzymes. The shape and size of the possible nucleophile pocket identified also suggested that multiple binding sites could exist , supporting the hypothesis of non-overlapping leaving and accepting nucleophiles binding sites.
