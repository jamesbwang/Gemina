 The Raman spectral profile of p-methylcarbohydrazonethioamide ( MCHT) is completely changed due to strong SERS effects upon bonding onto gold nanoparticles surface , but some vibrational modes are further enhanced in the presence of Hg ( II) ions. The lack of SERS response for most common metal ions indicates that the coordinating groups are interacting with the gold nanoparticles surface and not available for binding metal ions in solution , except for mercury ions. The selective enhancement of some vibrational modes is consistent with significant conformational changes upon binding of Hg ( II) ion onto the AuNP@MCHT hybrid , as confirmed by TEM/EDS measurements , demonstrating its potentiality as a highly selective and sensitive SERS substrate.
