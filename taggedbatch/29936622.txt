 A close association between Trichomonas vaginalis<pathogen> ( TV) infection and bacterial<disease> vaginosis<disease> ( BV) has been reported. Some other studies have found association is stronger with intermediate Nugent score than BV. Most studies have used wet mount microscopy , a relatively insensitive method , to detect TV infection. We wanted to study the association of TV infection with BV and with intermediate Nugent score. We undertook a cross-sectional hospital-based study of 1110 non-pregnant women from Odisha state , India , aged between 18 and 45 years , collecting vaginal swabs for diagnosis of BV by Nugent score ( NS) criteria and TV by PCR analysis. TV infection was found in 13.3 % of women with intermediate Nugent score ( NS 4-6) and 13.6 % with BV ( NS 7-10). Before adjustment , TV infection was associated with BV , intermediate Nugent , vaginal pH â‰¥ 4.5 , and age group between 26 and 35 years. Multivariate analysis confirmed that TV infection was more likely to have raised vaginal pH , either BV or intermediate Nugent. Proportion of TV cases increased sequentially with the increase in Nugent score up to NS 6 , after which a decline was observed. Vaginal pH was higher in the TV-infected group than the uninfected group in women with intermediate Nugent , but no difference was noticed in women with BV. TV infection was equally prevalent in women with intermediate Nugent as well as BV. In the intermediate Nugent group women , TV infection was found only when vaginal pH was raised , indicating a crucial role of vaginal pH in determining TV infection.
