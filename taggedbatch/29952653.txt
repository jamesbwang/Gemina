 To analyze the expression profile , diagnostic and clinicopathological significances of miRNAs in sinonasal inverted papilloma ( SNIP). The expression profile of miRNAs was analyzed using a miRNA microarray approach. The potential functions and clinical<disease> significances<disease> of specific miRNAs were further analyzed by bioinformatics and statistical methods. The microarray assay identified 37 significantly upregulated and 21 downregulated miRNAs in SNIP. Of nine miRNAs randomly selected , the expression levels of seven miRNAs were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. The potential target genes of several candidate miRNAs were enriched in some biological processes and cellular signaling pathways related to tumorigenesis. Receiever operating characteristic curve analysis for miR-214-3p indicated an area under the curve of 0.932. Notably , its expression level was significantly decreased in SNIP tissues and associated with SNIP staging and recurrence. MiR-214-3p can possibly serve as a valuable biomarker and a therapeutic target for SNIP.
