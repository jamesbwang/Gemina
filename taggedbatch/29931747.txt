 The present study investigated the effects of transferring freshwater ( FW) acclimated S.salar ( 678 g) that had been maintained under a constant photoperiod and thermal regime , into FW ( salinity 0) and salt water ( SW; salinity 35) on growth and physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> over a 28 day period. There were no mortalities observed throughout the study and no significant differences in mass or fork length between FW and SW groups after 28 days. Compared with fish transferred to FW , plasma osmolality and plasma chloride levels increased significantly in fish in SW by day 1. In the SW group , plasma chloride and osmolality had decreased significantly at day 14 when compared with day 1. Na
