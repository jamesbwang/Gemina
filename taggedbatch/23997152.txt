 There is currently a lack of an efficient , objective and systemic approach towards the classification of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) , due to its complex etiology and pathogenesis. As AD is inherently dynamic , it is also not clear how the relationships among AD indicators vary over time. To address these issues , we propose a hybrid computational approach for AD classification and evaluate it on the heterogeneous longitudinal AIBL dataset. Specifically , using clinical dementia rating as an index of AD severity , the most important indicators ( mini-mental state examination , logical memory recall , grey matter and cerebrospinal volumes from MRI and active voxels from PiB-PET brain scans , ApoE , and age) can be automatically identified from parallel data mining algorithms. In this work , Bayesian network modelling across different time points is used to identify and visualize time-varying relationships among the significant features , and importantly , in an efficient way using only coarse-grained data. Crucially , our approach suggests key data features and their appropriate combinations that are relevant for AD severity classification with high accuracy. Overall , our study provides insights into AD developments and demonstrates the potential of our approach in supporting efficient AD diagnosis.
