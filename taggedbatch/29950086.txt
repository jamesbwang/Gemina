 `` Xishuang '' is a special phenomenon that chemical composition of medicinal materials crystallize on the surface exposed to air for a long time. We summarized Herbal textual research of `` Xishuang '' phenomenon of six herbs , such as Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus , Moutan Cortex , Atractylodis Rhizoma , Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex , dried persimmon frost and watermelon frost. From historical perspective , cream of Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus was firstly discovered in Lei Gong 's Moxibustion Theory. Thereafter , dried persimmon frost was found in Song Dynasty , which was named `` white persimmon '' in Ben Cao Tu Jing and had become an independent medicine in Compendium of Materia Medica. Then , watermelon frost was found in Yang Yi Da Quan of the Qing Dynasty , and Moutan Cortex 's `` sand star '' was recorded in Zeng Ding Wei Yao Tiao Bian of the Republic of China. After that , `` Xishuang '' phenomenon of Atractylodis Rhizomaand Magnoliae<pathogen> Officinalis Cortex were reported in 1950s and 1960s in succession. The pattern of `` Xishuang '' is divided into different type , natural `` Xishuang '' includes Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus , Moutan Cortex , Atractylodis Rhizoma and Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex , artificial `` Xishuang '' includes watermelon frost , and dried persimmon frost formed crystals by using artificial intervention. The above 6 kinds of herbs have different crystal structure and chemical composition. Therefore , according to traditional identification experience , `` Xishuang '' phenomenon is related to varieties and quality of medicinal herbs. These research provide herbalism basis for the modern study of `` Xishuang '' medicinal materials.
