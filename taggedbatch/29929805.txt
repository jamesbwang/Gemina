 This study aimed to examine the professional values of nurses in Turkey. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 310 nurses employed at public , university , and private hospitals between May-June 2015. Data were collected using a data collection form and the Nurses ' Professional Values Scale-Revised , and they were analysed using descriptive statistics. Associations between socio-demographic variables and mean scores were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Nurses had higher scores on perception of professional values , and education level and years of professional experience were associated with higher scores. Results indicated that trust and justice were the most prominent professional values , whereas altruism and obedience were less favoured values. Overall , results indicated that participants ' had a strong professional value orientation , and education level and professional experience influenced nurses ' scores on professional values. Nurses ' professional values reflect their understanding of how care should be provided , which health care policy makers and nurse managers who make decisions on providing more humanistic health care should consider. Further studies using the Nurses ' Professional Values Scale-Revised , and other reliable and culture-specific instruments are recommended.
