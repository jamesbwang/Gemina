 The Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire ( DCQ) is a widely used screening instrument assessing dysmorphic concerns ranging from a mild to an excessive level. It is often used in the setting of plastic and aesthetic surgery. The present study aimed at examining the psychometric properties of the DCQ in a random general population sample. A representative sample of the German general population ( N = 2053 , aged between 18 and 65 years , 54 % females) completed the DCQ as well as questionnaires on depression<symptom> and appearance concerns. The DCQ showed a good internal consistency with Cronbach 's α = 0.81. Its one-factor model structure was confirmed. Normative data were stratified according to gender and age. Women reported more dysmorphic concerns than men , but also within females the DCQ scores differed between age classes. Overall , 4.0 % of the sample reported excessive dysmorphic concerns based on a previously defined cutoff sum score ≥ 11. The DCQ is a valid and reliable screening tool to identify individuals with excessive dysmorphic concerns. Excessive concerns may indicate also the presence of body dysmorphic disorder , but for verifying a final diagnosis the use of a structured clinical interview is necessary.
