 Ingestion of exogenous ketones alters the metabolic response to exercise and may improve exercise performance , but has not been explored in variable intensity team sport activity , or for effects on cognitive function. On two occasions in a double-blind , randomised crossover design , eleven male team sport athletes performed the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test ( Part A , 5x15 min intermittent running; Part B , shuttle run to exhaustion<symptom>) , with a cognitive test battery before and after. A 6.4 % carbohydrate-electrolyte solution was consumed before and during exercise either alone ( PLA) , or with 750 mg ⋅ kg of a ketone ester supplement ( KE). Heart rate ( HR) , rating of perceived exertion ( RPE) , and 15 m sprint times were recorded throughout , and serial venous blood samples were assayed for plasma glucose , lactate and β-hydroxybutyrate ( βHB). KE resulted in plasma βHB concentrations of ~ 1.5 to 2.6 mM during exercise ( P < 0.001). Plasma glucose and lactate concentrations were lower during KE compared to PLA ( moderate-to-large effect sizes). HR , RPE and 15 m sprint times did not differ between trials. Run time to exhaustion<symptom> was not different ( P = 0.126 , d = 0.45) between PLA ( ( mean ( 95 % CI); 268 , ( 199 , 336) sec) and KE ( 229 , ( 178 , 280) sec). Incorrect responses in a multi-tasking test increased from pre- to post-exercise in PLA ( 1.8 ( -0.6 , 4.1)) but not KE ( 0.0 ( -1.8 , 1.8)) ( P = 0.017; d = 0.70). Compared to carbohydrate alone , co-ingestion of a ketone ester by team sport athletes attenuated the rise in plasma lactate concentrations , but did not improve shuttle run time to exhaustion<symptom> or 15 m sprint times during intermittent running. An attenuation of the decline in executive function after exhausting exercise suggests a cognitive benefit after KE ingestion.
