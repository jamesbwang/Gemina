 Here we report a 31-year-old man with a peri-ampullary neuroendocrine tumor ( NET) , who underwent Ga DOTANOC-PET/CT for recurrence evaluation , which revealed isolated metastatic lesion<symptom> in liver segment V. He underwent trans-arterial radio-embolization ( TARE) of the isolated hepatic metastasis with Rhenium-microspheres in a lipiodol matrix. The second Ga DOTANOC-PET/CT was performed one month after the TARE therapy revealed resolution of the tracer uptake with good retention of the lipiodol complex replacing the metastasis suggesting a complete response.
