 Huntington 's disease ( HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease which has no effective treatment and is characterized by psychiatric disorders , motor alterations , and dementia , with the cognitive deficits representing a devastating aspect of the disorder. Oxidative stress and elevated levels of lipid peroxidation ( LPO) products are found in mouse models and patients with HD , suggesting that strategies to reduce LPO may be beneficial in HD. In contrast with traditional antioxidants , substituting hydrogen with deuterium at bis-allylic sites in polyunsaturated fatty acids ( D-PUFA) decreases the rate-limiting initiation step of PUFA autoxidation , a strategy that has shown benefits in other neurodegenerative diseases. Here , we investigated the effect of D-PUFA treatment in a knock-in mouse model of HD ( Q140) which presents motor deficits and neuropathology from a few months of age , and progressive cognitive decline. Q140 knock-in mice were fed a diet containing either D- or H-PUFAs for 5 months starting at 1 month of age. D-PUFA treatment significantly decreased F
