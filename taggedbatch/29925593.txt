 Membrane-bound proteinase 3 ( PR3m) is the main target antigen of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies ( ANCA) in granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( GPA). Binding of ANCA to PR3m triggers neutrophil activation with the secretion of enzymatically active proteases , thereby contributing to vascular damage. PR3 and related proteases are activated from proforms by the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin C ( CatC) during neutrophil maturation. We hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition of CatC provides an effective measure to reduce PR3m and has therefore implications as a novel therapeutic approach in GPA. We first studied neutrophilic PR3 from 24 patients with Papillon-Lef√®vre syndrome<disease><symptom> ( PLS) , a genetic form of CatC deficiency. PLS neutrophil lysates showed a largely reduced , but still detectable ( 0.5-4 %) PR3 activity when compared to healthy control cells. Despite extremely low levels of cellular PR3 , the amount of constitutive PR3m expressed on the surface of quiescent neutrophils , and the typical bimodal membrane distribution pattern , was similar to what was observed in healthy neutrophils. However , following cell activation , there was no significant increase in the total amount of PR3m on PLS neutrophils , whereas the total amount of PR3m on healthy neutrophils was significantly increased. We then explored the effect of pharmacological CatC inhibition on PR3 expression in normal neutrophils using a potent cell permeable CatC inhibitor and a CD34 + hematopoietic stem cell model. Human CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells were treated with the inhibitor during neutrophil differentiation over 10 days. We observed strong reductions in PR3m , cellular PR3 protein and proteolytic PR3 activity whereas neutrophil differentiation was not compromised.
