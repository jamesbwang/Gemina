 Laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC) is the standard of care for biliary disease in developed countries. LC in resource-limited countries is increasing. This prospective , observational study evaluates costs , outcomes , and quality of life ( QoL) associated with laparoscopic versus open cholecystectomy ( OC) in Mongolia. Patient demographics , outcomes , and total payer and patient costs were elicited from a convenience sample of patients undergoing cholecystectomy at four urban and three rural hospitals ( February 2016-January 2017). QoL was assessed preoperatively and postoperatively using the five-level EQ-5D instrument. Perioperative complications , surgical fees , and QoL scores were evaluated for LC versus OC. Multivariate regression models were generated to adjust for differences between these groups. Two hundred and fifteen cholecystectomies were included ( LC 122 , OC 93). LC patients were more likely to have attended college and have insurance. Preoperative symptoms were comparable between groups. Total complication rate was 21.8 % ( no difference between groups); LC patients had less superficial<disease> infections<disease> ( 0 % versus 10.8 %). Median hospital length of stay ( HLOS) and days to return to work were shorter after LC. QoL improved after surgery for both groups. Mean total payer and patient costs were higher for LC , but not significant ( P-value 0.126). After adjustment , LC had significantly less complications , shorter HLOS , fewer days to return to work , greater improvement in QoL scores , and no increase in cost. LC is safe and beneficial to patients with biliary disease in Mongolia , and cost effective from the patient 's and payer 's perspective. Although equipment costs for LC may be more expensive than OC , there are likely significant cost savings related to reduced HLOS , shorter time off work , fewer complications , and improved QoL.
