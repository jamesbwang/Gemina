 A small library of 36 new glycohybrids of phenylhydrazono-indolinones was synthesized employing glycosylated 1,2,3-triazolyl-methyl-indoline-2,3-diones and different phenylhydrazines via acid catalyzed reaction. All the compounds were screened for their antiplasmodial activity in vitro. Compounds 6c , 7c , and 7b showed significant activity with the IC
