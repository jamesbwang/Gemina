 This study evaluates the impact of a 3-week period of intensive pelvic floor muscles training ( PFMT) , with or without instrumentation , on clinical and static magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) changes of puborectalis ( PR) and iliococcygeus ( IL) muscles. 24 healthy young women were enrolled in the study and 17 achieved the 9 sessions of 30 min training exercises and conducted all assessments. Participants were randomly assigned in two training groups: voluntary contractions combined with hypopressive exercises ( HYPO) or biofeedback exercises combined with transvaginal electrical stimulations ( ELEC). Clinical and T2-weighted MRI assessments were realized before and after training. Modified Oxford Grading System ( MOGS) scores for left PR and perineal body significantly increased in the two groups ( p = 0.039 , p = 0.008) , but MOGS score for right PR significantly increased only in HYPO ( p = 0.020). Muscle volumes of right and left IL significantly decreased ( p = 0.040 , p = 0.045) after training as well as signal intensities of right and left PR ( p = 0.040 , p = 0.021) and thickness of right and left IL at mid-vagina location ( p = 0.012 , p = 0.011). A short period of intensive PFMT induces clinical and morphological changes in PFMs at rest suggesting a decrease in IL volume and adipose content of PR. Although the results suggested that an intensive non-instrumented PFMT is as effective as an instrumented training , future controlled studies with greater sample sizes are needed to establish the relative and absolute effectiveness of each of the two interventions.
