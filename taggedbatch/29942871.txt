 Two-Sided Matching is a well-established approach to find allocations and matchings based on the participants ' preferences. While its most prominent applications are College Admissions and School Choice problems , this paper applies the concept to the matching of mentors to mentees in a higher education context. Both mentors and mentees have preferences with whom they ideally want to be matched , as well as who they want to avoid. As the general formulation for these types of preferences is NP-hard , several existing approximation algorithms and heuristics are compared with respect to their ability to find a matching with desirable properties. The results show that a combination of evolutionary heuristics and local search approaches works best in finding high-quality solutions , allowing us to find mentor-mentee pairs which are close to the respective ideal match.
