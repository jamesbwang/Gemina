 Thrombophilia is a hypercoagulable state that predisposes to thrombosis. Several genetic risk factors have been shown to predispose to thromboembolic events. Homozygosity to a thrombophilic mutation certainly predisposes the affected patient to more serious symptoms. Here we present a case of a 56-year-old male patient who underwent sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity , presenting to our institution with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom>. Investigations revealed thrombosis of the splenic , axillary vein as well as the right pulmonary artery. The patient was found to have triple thrombophilic mutations. To our knowledge , this is the first reported case of three specific simultaneous thrombophilic mutations in a patient from the Eastern Middle<pathogen> East. We suggest a role for screening for thrombophilic mutations in the Eastern Mediterranean patients undergoing bariatric surgeries for morbid obesity due to the increased risk of thrombosis in this group of patients.
