 Nutritional support is seen as a vital component in the battle to attenuate the extreme hypermetabolic response experienced by patients suffering from large thermal injuries. Protein catabolism precipitating protein malnutrition places patients at greater risk of wound<disease><symptom> infection<disease> and sepsis<disease> due to delayed wound<disease><symptom> healing. Underfeeding , aggressive feeding , feeding routes , timing of initiation of feeding and tight insulin control have all been explored extensively in the quest to understand what nutritional treatment will best attenuate the hypermetabolic response. Despite this it is suggested that the majority of patients with large thermal injuries do not receive adequate nutritional support immediately post injury. Nurses have a pivotal role to play in ensuring that thermal injury patients receive appropriate nutritional support based on the best available evidence.
