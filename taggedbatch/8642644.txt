 The 2014 western Africa Ebola<disease> virus ( EBOV<pathogen>) epidemic was unprecedented in magnitude , infecting over 28,000 and causing over 11,000 deaths. During this outbreak , multiple instances of EBOV<pathogen> sexual transmission were reported , including cases where the infectious individual had recovered from EBOV disease months before transmission. Potential human host factors in EBOV<pathogen> sexual transmission remain unstudied. Several basic seminal amyloids , most notably semen-derived enhancer of viral<disease> infection<disease> ( SEVI) , enhance in vitro infection by HIV<pathogen> and several other viruses. To test the ability of these peptides to enhance EBOV infection , viruses bearing the EBOV<pathogen> glycoprotein ( EboGP) were preincubated with physiological concentrations of SEVI before infection of physiologically relevant cell lines and primary cells. Preincubation with SEVI significantly increased EboGP-mediated infectivity and replication in epithelium- and monocyte-derived cell lines. This enhancement was dependent upon amyloidogenesis and positive charge , and infection results were observed with both viruses carrying EboGP and authentic EBOV<pathogen> as well as with semen. SEVI enhanced binding of virus to cells and markedly increased its subsequent internalization. SEVI also stimulated uptake of a fluid phase marker by macropinocytosis , a critical mechanism by which cells internalize EBOV<pathogen>. We report a previously unrecognized ability of SEVI and semen to significantly alter viral physical properties critical for transmissibility by increasing the stability of EboGP-bearing recombinant viruses during incubation at elevated temperature and providing resistance to desiccation. Given the potential for EBOV<pathogen> sexual transmission to spark new transmission chains , these findings represent an important interrogation of factors potentially important for this EBOV<pathogen> transmission route.
