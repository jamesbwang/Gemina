 To compare insulin sensitivity ( M/I) and β-cell responses in youth versus adults with impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT) or drug-naïve , recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. In 66 youth ( 80.3 % with IGT) and 355 adults ( 70.7 % IGT) , hyperglycemic clamps were used to measure Insulin sensitivity was 46 % lower in youth compared with adults ( In people with IGT or recently diagnosed diabetes , youth have lower insulin sensitivity , hyperresponsive β-cells , and reduced insulin clearance compared with adults. Whether these age-related differences contribute to declining β-cell function and/or impact responses to glucose-lowering interventions remains to be determined.
