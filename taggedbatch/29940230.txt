 In this study , we prepared double cross-linked interpenetrating polymer network ( IPN) hydrogels composed of temperature sensitive poly ( N-isopropylacrylamide) ( PNIPAM) and pH sensitive hyaluronic acid ( HA) by radical polymerization and Michael addition. Their physicochemical properties for transdermal delivery of luteolin inhibiting the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes in psoriasis were investigated and drug release studies were performed. Double networks of HA/PNIPAM IPN hydrogel were identified through FT-IR and
