 Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ( IDO) contributes to maintaining immune homeostasis. Polymorphisms ( SNPs) of the IDO encoding gene ( IDO1) influence the IDO activity. Interferon ( IFN)- λ3 induces IDO expression. We aimed to investigate whether IDO1 variants are associated with anti-HBs production in response to HBV vaccination or infection , interact with IFN-λ3 associated variants of IFNL4 , and influence survival of hemodialysis ( HD) patients. We also tested circulating IDO concerning IDO1 SNPs and plasma IFN-λ3 and anti-HBs levels. The study included HD patients who had established status concerning responsiveness to HBV vaccination ( n = 1022) or were exposed to HBV ( n = 315). Ability to generate anti-HBs was diagnosed if anti-HBs after vaccination or infection exceeded 10 IU/L. Genotyping of IDO1 ( rs3739319 A < G , rs9657182 C < T) , IFNL4 rs8099917 G < T and IFNL4 rs12979860 C > T polymorphisms was carried out by high-resolution melting curve analysis. Circulating IDO and IFN-λ3 were measured with ELISA in 57 subjects. Survival probability was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. IDO1 SNPs did not correlate with the ability to produce anti-HBs after vaccination or infection. Anti-HBs titers , including a frequency of anti-HBs ≥ 1000 IU/l , also did not associate with IDO1 SNPs , but there was an epistatic interaction between rs9657182 , rs8099917 , and rs12979860 concerning anti-HBs titers ( P = 0.028). Significant associations between IDO1 SNPs and circulating IDO were not demonstrated. Anti-HBs titers negatively correlated with plasma IDO ( r = -0.358 , P = 0.006) , and positively with circulating IFN-λ3 ( r = 0.498 , P = 0.00008). IDO and IFN-λ3 did not correlate. Patients possessing the rs9657182 TT genotype showed higher infection-related mortality , also in multivariate analysis ( HR 2.073 , 1.221-3.518 , P = 0.007). IDO1 rs9657182 , IFNL4 rs8099917 , and IFNL4 rs12979860 show epistatic interaction concerning anti-HBs titers. Overreacting immune responses to HBsAg occur in patients with lower IDO but simultaneously higher IFN-λ3 levels. The rs9657182 TT genotype associates with infection-related mortality of HD patients.
