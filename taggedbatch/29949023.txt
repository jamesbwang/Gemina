 A 3D convolution neural network ( CNN) of deep learning architecture is supplied with essential visual features to accurately classify and segment granulation , necrotic eschar , and slough tissues in pressure ulcer<disease><symptom> color images. After finding a region of interest ( ROI) , the features are extracted from both the original and convolved with a pre-selected Gaussian kernel 3D HSI images , combined with first-order models of current and prior visual appearance. The models approximate empirical marginal probability distributions of voxel-wise signals with linear combinations of discrete Gaussians ( LCDG). The framework was trained and tested on 193 color pressure ulcer<disease><symptom> images. The classification accuracy and robustness were evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient ( DSC) , the percentage area distance ( PAD) , and the area under the ROC curve ( AUC). The obtained preliminary DSC of 92 % , PAD of 13 % , and AUC of 95 % are promising.
