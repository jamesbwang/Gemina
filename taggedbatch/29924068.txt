 This study examined the relationship between the Gait Deviation<symptom> Index ( GDI) and walking activity preoperatively and postoperatively. The GDI and walking activity from 74 youth with cerebral palsy ( CP) were included in the analysis. The preoperative GDI was calculated using gait parameters collected during a clinical gait analysis 1 to 16 months prior to surgery. The postoperative GDI was calculated using gait parameters collected during a clinical gait analysis 10 to 26 months following surgery. A weak correlation was present between the change in the average GDI and the change in strides. A moderate correlation was found between the change in the Surgery GDI and the change in strides. Single-event multilevel surgery improves gait deviations<symptom> in children with CP. However , the improvement in gait pattern has limited correlation with postoperative change in walking activity. Our results demonstrate a need to pair surgical with additional intervention to affect long-term improvements in walking activity.
