 Infants with a single ventricle can develop systemic ventricular dysfunction ( SVD) after stage 1 operation , but available information is sparse. We reviewed our patients having Norwood , Sano , or hybrid procedures to better understand this problem. We conducted a retrospective , case-controlled cohort study of 267 patients having stage1 operation , examining outcomes between stages 1 and 2 ( survival and subsequent cardiac surgeries) , predictor variables , and histology of hearts explanted at transplantation. SVD developed in 32 ( 12 %) patients and resolved in 13 ( 41 %); mean age of onset was 3.0 ± 1.63 months; median = 2.79. SVD was not associated with cardiac anatomy , type of stage 1 procedure , weight , coronary abnormality , or atrioventricular valve regurgitation. The mean age of resolution = 12.1 ± 9.6 months; median = 6.3 , and resolution may have been more likely with a systemic LV than RV ( p = 0.067). Outcomes for the entire SVD group were less favorable than for those without , but patients with resolution of SVD had outcomes at least as good those without SVD. Myocardial histology ( n = 4) suggested chronic ischemia. The risk of SVD after stage 1 , while low , may be a fundamental feature of this patient population. SVD occurs with either a systemic RV or LV , although patients with a systemic LV may be more likely to have resolution than those with an RV. We identified no predictor variables , but histologic findings suggest chronic ischemia may be involved. Given the low incidence of SVD , multi-center studies will be required to better define predictors of onset and resolution.
