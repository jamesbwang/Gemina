 To evaluate the Risk of Endometrial Cancer ( REC) scoring system for the prediction of high and low probability of endometrial cancer ( EC) in women with postmenopausal bleeding ( PMB). Prospective study ( Canadian Task Force classification II-1). Academic hospital. Nine hundred and fifty consecutive patients with PMB underwent transvaginal ultrasonography ( TVS) and REC scoring between November 2013 and December 2015. Obstetrics and gynecology residents , supervised by trained physicians , scored endometrial patterns according to the previously established REC scoring system. The reference standard was endometrial samples , endometrial thickness ( ET; 4-4.9 mm) , operative hysteroscopy , or hysterectomy ( ET ≥ 5 mm) , and one-year follow-up in all patients presenting with ET < 4 mm. Diagnostic performance for prediction of probability of malignancy was assessed using the REC scoring system. The area under the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve ( AUC) of the TVS REC score system was 97 % ( range: 95-98) for prediction of malignancy. In 656 patients with ET ≥ 4 mm , REC scoring effectively predicted high probability of malignancy: sensitivity ( 95 % confidence interval): 92 % ( range: 87 % -95 %); specificity: 94 % ( range: 91 % -96 %). An REC score of 0 was present in 206 ( 32 %) patients with ET ≥ 4 mm and was associated with a low negative likelihood ratio of 0.026 for EC. Only 7 patients with EC/atypical hyperplasia<disease> were seen among these 206 patients. The REC scoring system identified or ruled out most ECs , clearly demonstrating that more specific image analysis at first-line TVS can accelerate the diagnosis of EC in patients with PMB and may allow for improved selection of second-line strategies in patients with ET ≥ 4 mm.
