 Multiple signaling molecules and transcription factors are required for pituitary development. Activator-type bHLH genes Mash1 , Math , NeuroD and Neurogenin are well known as key molecules in neural development. Although analyses of targeted mouse mutants have demonstrated involvement of these bHLH genes in pituitary development , studies with single-mutant mice could not elucidate their exact functions , because they cooperatively function and compensate each other. The aim of this study was to elucidate the roles of Mash1 , Math3 and NeuroD in pituitary development. Mash1; Math3; NeuroD triple-mutant mice were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real time RT-PCR. Misexpression studies with retroviruses in pituisphere cultures were also performed. The triple-mutant adenohypophysis was morphologically normal , though the lumen of the neurohypophysis remained unclosed. However , in triple-mutant pituitaries , somatotropes , gonadotropes and corticotropes were severely decreased , whereas lactotropes were increased. Misexpression of Mash1 alone with retrovirus could not induce generation of hormonal cells , though Mash1 was involved in differentiation of pituitary progenitor cells. These data suggest that Mash1 , Math3 and NeuroD cooperatively control the timing of pituitary progenitor cell differentiation , and that they are also required for subtype specification of pituitary hormonal cells. Mash1 is necessary for corticotroph and gonadotroph differentiation , and compensated by Math3 and NeuroD. Math3 is necessary for somatotroph differentiation , and compensated by Mash1 and NeuroD. Neurogenin2 may compensate Mash1 , Math3 and NeuroD during pituitary development. Furthermore , Mash1 , Math3 and NeuroD are required for neurohypophysis development. Thus , Mash1 , Math3 and NeuroD are required for pituitary development , and compensate each other.
