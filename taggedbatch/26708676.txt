 We previously revealed that two major quantitative trait loci ( QTLs) for stroke latency of the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat ( SHRSP) under salt-loading were located on chromosome ( Chr) 1 and 18. Here , we attempted further dissection of the stroke-QTLs using multiple congenic strains between SHRSP and a stroke-resistant hypertensive rat ( SHR). Cox hazard model among subcongenic strains harboring a chromosomal fragment of Chr-1 QTL region showed that the most promising region was a 2.1 Mbp fragment between D1Rat177 and D1Rat97. The QTL region on Chr 18 could not be narrowed down by the analysis , which may be due to multiple QTLs in this region. Nonsynonymous sequence variations were found in four genes ( Cblc , Cxcl17 , Cic , and Ceacam 19) on the 2.1 Mbp fragment of Chr-1 QTL by whole-genome sequence analysis of SHRSP/Izm and SHR/Izm. Significant changes in protein structure were predicted in CBL-C and CXCL17 using I-TASSER. Comprehensive gene expression analysis in the kidney with a cDNA microarray identified three candidate genes ( LOC102548695 ( Zinc finger protein 45-like , Zfp45L) , Ethe1 , and Cxcl17). In conclusion , we successfully narrowed down the QTL region on Chr 1 , and identified six candidate genes in this region.
