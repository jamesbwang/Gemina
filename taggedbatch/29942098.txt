 Gestational age and birth weight are supposed to associate with childhood blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> but remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between gestational age , birth weight , and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> among Chinese children. In all , 49357 children aged 6-18 years were included from a nationwide survey in China. Gestational age , birth weight , and socioeconomic data were collected by questionnaires. Systolic ( SBP) and diastolic ( DBP) blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> were objectively measured. The associations between birth measures and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> were examined by multivariable linear regression and logistic regression. The prevalence of hypertension was 19.1 % , 19.2 % , and 21.0 % in preterm , term , and post-term subgroups , and 20.1 % , 19.1 % , and 19.8 % in low- , normal- , and high-birth-weight subgroups , respectively. Results showed significantly positive associations of gestational age with SBP , DBP , SBP z-score , and DBP z-score in the overall and term subgroup , but not in the preterm or post-term subgroup. Birth weight was inversely related to SBP , DBP , SBP z-score , and DBP z-score across the entire birth-weight spectrum , and the overall association was stronger in girls than in boys. Similar associations were found in diffident age subgroups. Children with high birth weight had decreased odds of hypertension ( OR 0.84 , 95 % CI 0.77-0.92) after adjustment for covariates. Preterm birth increased the risk of high SBP only in boys. This study suggested that gestational age was positively associated with blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> only in term-born children. Birth weight had a negative association with childhood blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> across the whole range of birth weight.
