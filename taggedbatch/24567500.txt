 The aim of this report is to present a new two-piece thyroid-neck phantom produced by the concurrent use of epoxy resin and poly ( methyl methacrylate) ( PMMA: plexiglass) soft<disease> tissue equivalent materials. Accordingly , mass attenuation coefficients of the epoxy resin and the plexiglass compounds were obtained from simulation ( NIST XCOM 3.1) and measurements ( practical dosimetry) and compared to those related to human soft<disease> tissue ( ICRU 44). The thyroid-neck phantom and thyroid gland dimensions were derived from scientific references and the atlas of human anatomy , respectively. The thyroid phantom was designed by CATIA V5R16 software and produced by the epoxy resin compound by three-dimensional printer. Other organs were designed by ProNest software and made by the plexiglass sheets by CNC laser cutting machine. The mass attenuation coefficients for the epoxy resin ( 50 keV- 20 MeV) and the plexiglass ( 0-20 MeV) were comparable to human soft<disease> tissue ( ICRU 44) , all with standard relative deviation beneath 5 %. In addition , the SPECT images indicated the similarity between human thyroid tissue and its phantom. In conclusion , this study proves the feasibility and reliability of epoxy resin application in the production of two-piece thyroid-neck phantom. This phantom can be applied in the calibration of gamma camera systems , dosimetry and gamma spectrometry in the nuclear medicine field.
