 Institutional review boards ( IRBs) that refuse to grant waivers of guardian permission may hinder research to inform needed online sexual health interventions for adolescent males interested in sex with males ( AMSM). Information on the challenges of obtaining ( or waiving) guardian permission is imperative. In June and July 2017 , AMSM ( N = 206; ages 14 to 17) in the United States completed an online survey on sexual behaviors , sexually explicit media use , and sexual education exposure/needs. A mixed-methods approach assessed attitudes toward guardian permission for the current survey and future online sexual health intervention research. Logistic regression models assessed differences by `` outness '' to a guardian. A framework matrix analysis was conducted to summarize , then aggregate , qualitative responses. Findings indicated that most AMSM would not participate if guardian permission was required ( current: 83 %; future: 87 %). Youth who were not out were more likely to say they would not participate ( current: adjusted odds ratio ( AOR) = 2.8 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.2 to 6.8); future: AOR = 4.7 , 95 % CI: 1.6 to 13.5). Participants reported that guardian permission would be an invasion of their privacy , lead to involuntary outing , and endanger participants. Overall , guardian permission appears to be a barrier to AMSM participation in online sexual health research. Investigators and IRBs should consider alternative practices and policies to facilitate such research.
