 The presentation of scientific work resembles popular media narratives far more than it does the traditional paper writing that scientists are trained in. In the former , a good ` hook ' is essential so as to hang a paper that is presented as a slide show , an abstract , a poster or text directly addressed to the media , and this hook must be obvious and apparent up front. A slight element of truthful sensationalism is therefore often helpful. This set of Best Practice Guidelines will offer factual and practical guidelines with regard to preparing research in these formats since self-presentation is essential for career progression. It is not only what we do but how we are seen to be doing it , acceding to Batman 's aphorism: `` it 's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me ''. Research preparation and presentation and skills of all sorts are thus increasingly critical in the increasingly competitive world of academia.
