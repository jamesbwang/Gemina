 Clinical inertia is common in all chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , including diabetes. Despite the advent of newer agents for the management of hyperglycemia , hypertension , and dyslipidemia , the number of people with diabetes hitting all three targets remains small. The causes of clinical inertia are multifactorial , with contributory elements from people with diabetes , physicians , and the system within which they work. Every health care provider should have the best interest of their patients at heart; most people with diabetes want to maintain their health for as long as possible , and the maintenance of good health is not only the purpose of the system , but also the most cost-effective strategy. It is the thesis of this article that a potential reversible contributor to clinical inertia is the communication among these individual elements , which can be called `` coproduction. '' The coproduction model of open communication encourages discourse , allowing the person with diabetes to understand their diagnosis and therefore better engage in treatment options. Improving engagement allows the healthcare team , including the physician and the person with diabetes , to establish shared goals that are important to all team members and to agree to acceptable side effects or risks of interventions in order to achieve these goals. Everyone needs to acknowledge that non-adherence exists and can be an issue , thereby allowing reasons to be explored. Only once the person with diabetes is allowed to take full ownership of their disease and actively participate in decision making can they take control of their disease , thereby improving outcomes.
