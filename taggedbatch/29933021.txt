 Management of patients suffering from myocardial infarction ( MI) is based on the extent of coronary artery disease and myocardial scar burden. We have developed a potentially clinically-useful X-ray molecular imaging contrast agent based on gold nanoparticle ( AuNPs) functionalized with collagen-binding adhesion protein 35 ( CNA35) with the capabilities of achieving prolonged blood pool enhancement for vascular imaging of the coronary arteries and specific targeting of collagen within myocardial scar. At a concentration of ~ 45 mg Au/ml , AuNPs maintained a stable blood pool enhancement at 142-160 HU within an hour of intravenous administration. At 6 hours , specific signal enhancement was detected in the myocardium scar in rats injected with CNA35-AuNPs , but not with control AuNPs or in control animals. In conclusion , CNA35-AuNPs may be considered as a CT contrast agent for both vascular imaging of coronary artery disease and molecular imaging of myocardial scar in the heart.
