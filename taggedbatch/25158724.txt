 Microtia reconstruction is a challenging procedure , especially in developing nations. The most complex part is learning how to fabricate a framework from costal cartilage. We herein propose a training regimen for ear reconstruction with the use of a plastic eraser. The texture of a plastic eraser made from polyvinyl chloride is similar to that of human costal cartilage. The first step of the training is carving out the sixth through eighth rib cartilages from a block of plastic eraser. The second step is a fabrication of the framework from plastic rib cartilages , referring to a template from the intact auricle. As plastic erasers are inexpensive and universally available , inexperienced surgeons can repeatedly perform this framework training. Following several of these training sessions in developing nations , the co-authors and local surgeons successfully performed their microtia reconstructions in a reasonable operative time. This realistic carving model allows surgeons to gain experience before performing an actual ear reconstruction , even in resource-constrained circumstances.
