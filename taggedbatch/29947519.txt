 Tablets containing a theophylline-glutaric acid ( TG) cocrystal dissociated rapidly forming crystalline theophylline ( 20-30 %) , following storage at 40 Â°C/ 75 % RH for 2 weeks. Control tablets of TG cocrystal containing no excipients were stable under the same conditions. The dissociation reaction was water-mediated , and the theophylline concentration ( the dissociation product) , monitored by synchrotron X-ray diffractometry , was strongly influenced by the formulation composition. Investigation of the binary compacts of the TG cocrystal with each excipient revealed the influence of excipient properties ( hydrophilicity , ionizability) on cocrystal stability , providing mechanistic insights into a dissociation reaction. Ionizable excipients with a strong tendency to sorb water , for example , sodium starch glycolate and croscarmellose sodium , caused pronounced dissociation. Microcrystalline cellulose ( MCC) , while a neutral but hydrophilic excipient , also enabled solution-mediated cocrystal dissociation in intact tablets. Magnesium stearate , an ionizable but hydrophobic excipient , interacted with the cocrystal to form a hygroscopic product. The interaction is believed to be initiated in the disordered cocrystal-excipient particle interface. In contrast , the cocrystal was stable in the presence of lactose , a neutral excipient with no tendency to sorb water. The risk of unintended cocrystal dissociation can be mitigated by avoiding contact with water both during processing and storage.
