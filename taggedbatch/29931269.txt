 Antibody engineering is often performed to improve therapeutic properties by directed evolution , usually by high-throughput screening of phage or yeast display libraries. Engineering antibodies in mammalian cells offer advantages associated with expression in their final therapeutic format ( full-length glycosylated IgG); however , the inability to express large and diverse libraries severely limits their potential throughput. To address this limitation , we have developed homology-directed mutagenesis ( HDM) , a novel method which extends the concept of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair ( HDR). HDM leverages oligonucleotides with degenerate codons to generate site-directed mutagenesis libraries in mammalian cells. By improving HDR to a robust efficiency of 15-35 % and combining mammalian display screening with next-generation sequencing , we validated this approach can be used for key applications in antibody engineering at high-throughput: rational library construction , novel variant discovery , affinity maturation and deep mutational scanning ( DMS). We anticipate that HDM will be a valuable tool for engineering and optimizing antibodies in mammalian cells , and eventually enable directed evolution of other complex proteins and cellular therapeutics.
