 Epithelial cell-derived IL-33 has an important role in the initiation and activation of innate allergic inflammation<symptom>. IL-33 acts as a cytokine through the ST2 receptor ( ST2L) and it stimulates the production of Th2 cytokines. Soluble ST2 ( sST2) may regulate Th2 responses by neutralizing the activity of IL-33. Basophils express ST2L and produce IL-5 in response to IL-33. However , the role of the epithelial cell-basophil interaction and sST2 in IL-5 production remains unclear. Cultured human bronchial epithelial ( hBE33) cells , that contained the human IL-33 gene ( i.e. , hBE33 cells) and a human basophilic cell line , KU812 cells , were used to study the epithelial cell-basophil interaction in the production of IL-5 induced by HDM. At 15 min after incubation , HDM stimulated the rapid release of IL-33 from cultured hBE33 cells. IL-33 and the supernatant of HDM-treated hBE33 cells stimulated IL-5 production from KU812 cells. Anti-IL-33 antibody and anti-ST2 antibody treatment of KU812 cells suppressed IL-5 production , which had been induced by the supernatant of HDM-treated hBE33 cells. The hBE33 cells secreted sST2 in a time-dependent manner. The production of sST2 by KU812 cells co-cultured with hBE33 cells was significantly increased , compared with KU812 cells cultured with the supernatant of hBE33 cells. Soluble ST2 suppressed IL-5 production by KU812 cells , which was induced by the supernatant of HDM-treated hBE33 cells. Epithelial cell-derived IL-33 promoted IL-5 production by KU812 cells. The subsequently produced sST2 has important roles in regulating Th2 responses.
