 Bile acid transporters including the ileal apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter ( ASBT) and the hepatic sodium-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide ( NTCP) are crucial for the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Our objective was to develop a method for measuring bile acid transporter activity in real time to precisely evaluate rapid changes in their function. We designed a reporter system relying on a novel probe: cholic acid attached to luciferin via a disulfide-containing , self-immolating linker ( CA-SS-Luc). Incubation of HEK 293 cells co-expressing luciferase and ASBT with different concentrations of CA-SS-Luc ( 0.01-1 μM) resulted in bioluminescence with an intensity that was concentration- and time-dependent. The bioluminescence measured during incubation with 1 μM CA-SS-Luc was dependent on the levels of ASBT or NTCP expressed in the cells. Co-incubation of CA-SS-Luc with natural bile acids enhanced the bioluminescence in a concentration-dependent manner with kinetic parameters for ASBT similar to those previously reported using conventional methods. These findings suggest that this method faithfully assesses ASBT function. Further , incubation with tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor ( PTPIII) led to significantly increased bioluminescence in cells expressing ASBT , consistent with previous studies showing an increase in ASBT function by PTPIII. We then investigated CA-SS-Luc in isolated mouse intestinal epithelial cells. Ileal enterocytes displayed significantly higher luminescence compared to jejunal enterocytes , indicating a transport process mediated by ileal ASBT. In conclusion , we have developed a novel method to monitor the activity of bile acid transporters in real time that has potential applications both for in vitro and in vivo studies.
