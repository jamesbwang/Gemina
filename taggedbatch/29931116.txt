 Human brain anatomical and resting-state functional connectivity have been comprehensively portrayed using MRI , which are termed anatomical and functional connectomes. A systematic examination of tasks modulated whole brain functional connectivity , which we term as task connectome , is still lacking. We analyzed 6 block-designed and 1 event-related designed functional MRI data , and examined whole-brain task modulated connectivity in various task domains , including emotion , reward , language , relation , social cognition , working memory , and inhibition. By using psychophysiological interaction between pairs of regions from the whole brain , we identified statistically significant task modulated connectivity in 4 tasks between their experimental and respective control conditions. Task modulated connectivity was found not only between regions that were activated during the task but also regions that were not activated or deactivated , suggesting a broader involvement of brain regions in a task than indicated by simple regional activations. Decreased functional connectivity was observed in all the 4 tasks and sometimes reduced connectivity was even between regions that were both activated during the task. This suggests that brain regions that are activated together do not necessarily work together. The current study demonstrates the comprehensive task connectomes of 4 tasks , and suggested complex relationships between regional activations and connectivity changes.
