 Ginkgo leaf tablets ( GLTs) and losartan are often simultaneously used for the treatment of hypertension in Chinese clinics. However , the herb-drug interaction between GLT and losartan is still unknown. This study investigates the effects of GLT on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its metabolite EXP3174 in rats and its potential mechanism. The pharmacokinetic profiles of losartan and EXP3174 of orally administered losartan ( 10 mg/kg) with or without GLT pretreatment ( 80 mg/kg/day for 10 days) in Sprague-Dawley rats were determined. In vitro , the effects of GLT on the metabolic stability of losartan were investigated with rat liver microsomes. The C The results indicate that GLT might increase the plasma concentration of losartan and decrease the concentration of EXP3174 through inhibiting the metabolism of losartan.
