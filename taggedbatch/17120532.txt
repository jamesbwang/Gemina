 A single-cell assay of active and passive intracellular mechanical properties of mammalian cells could give significant insight into cellular processes. Force spectrum microscopy ( FSM) is one such technique , which combines the spontaneous motion of probe particles and the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton measured by active microrheology using optical tweezers to determine the force spectrum of the cytoskeleton. A simpler and noninvasive method to perform FSM would be very useful , enabling its widespread adoption. Here , we develop an alternative method of FSM using measurement of the fluctuating motion of mitochondria. Mitochondria of the C3H-10T1/ 2 cell line were labeled and tracked using confocal microscopy. Mitochondrial probes were selected based on morphological characteristics , and their mean-square displacement , creep compliance , and distributions of directional change were measured. We found that the creep compliance of mitochondria resembles that of particles in viscoelastic media. However , comparisons of creep compliance between controls and cells treated with pharmacological agents showed that perturbations to the actomysoin network had surprisingly small effects on mitochondrial fluctuations , whereas microtubule disruption and ATP depletion led to a significantly decreased creep compliance. We used properties of the distribution of directional change to identify a regime of thermally dominated fluctuations in ATP-depleted cells , allowing us to estimate the viscoelastic parameters for a range of timescales. We then determined the force spectrum by combining these viscoelastic properties with measurements of spontaneous<symptom> fluctuations<symptom> tracked in control cells. Comparisons with previous measurements made using FSM revealed an excellent match.
