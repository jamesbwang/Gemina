 Culture-independent analysis of microbial communities frequently relies on amplification and sequencing of the prokaryotic 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Typical analysis pipelines group sequences into operational taxonomic units ( OTUs) to infer taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships. Here , we present HmmUFOtu , a novel tool for processing microbiome amplicon sequencing data , which performs rapid per-read phylogenetic placement , followed by phylogenetically informed clustering into OTUs and taxonomy assignment. Compared to standard pipelines , HmmUFOtu more accurately and reliably recapitulates microbial community diversity and composition in simulated and real datasets without relying on heuristics or sacrificing speed or accuracy.
