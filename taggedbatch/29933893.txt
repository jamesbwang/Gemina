 This study compares continuity of care between Germany- a social health insurance country , and Norway- a national health service country with gatekeeping and patient lists for COPD patients before and after initial hospitalization. We also investigate how subsequent readmissions are affected. Continuity of Care Index ( COCI) , Usual Provider Index ( UPC) and Sequential Continuity Index ( SECON) were calculated using insurance claims and national register data ( 2009-14). These indices were used in negative binomial and logistic regressions to estimate incident rate ratios ( IRR) and odds ratios ( OR) for comparing readmissions. All continuity indices were significantly lower in Norway. One year readmissions were significantly higher in Germany , whereas 30-day rates were not. All indices measured one year after discharge were negatively associated with one-year readmissions for both countries. Significant associations between indices measured before hospitalization and readmissions were only observed in Norway- all indices for one-year readmissions and SECON for 30-day readmissions. Our findings indicate higher continuity is associated with reductions in readmissions following initial COPD admission. This is observed both before and after hospitalization in a system with gatekeeping and patient lists , yet only after for a system lacking such arrangements. These results emphasize the need for policy strategies to further investigate and promote care continuity in order to reduce hospital readmission burden for COPD patients.
