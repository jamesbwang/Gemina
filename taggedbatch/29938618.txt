 By acting on multiple targets and promoting diverse actions , angiotensin II ( Ang II) plays a pivotal role in vascular function. Recent studies suggested that phosphodiesterase-5 ( PDE-5) inhibitors exhibit therapeutic effects in cardiovascular diseases. Here , the effects of sildenafil on vascular disturbances were analyzed in a mouse model of Ang II-induced hypertension. Male C57BL/6 mice were used as untreated animals ( Control) or infused with Ang II ( 1000 g/kg/min) for 28 days and treated with sildenafil ( 40 mg/kg/min) or vehicle ( Ang II) during the last two weeks. After 4 weeks , the Ang II animals exhibited a high systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( 186 ± 3 mmHg vs. 127 ± 3 mmHg for Control mice) , which was attenuated by sildenafil ( 163 ± 7 mmHg). The mesenteric vessels from the Ang II animals revealed damage to the endothelial layer , an increase in the cross-section area ( 1.9-fold) and vascular cell production of peroxynitrite ( 512 ± 13 a.u.) , which was ameliorated in the Ang II-Sil group ( 1.2-fold and 400 ± 17 a.u.). Analysis of the vascular responsiveness showed an increased contractility response to norepinephrine in Ang II animals ( Rmax: 70 %) , which was abolished by sildenafil through increased nitric oxide ( NO) bioavailability and decreased reactive oxygen species ( ROS) and vasoconstrictor prostanoids. Sildenafil attenuates the morphofunctional deleterious effects of Ang II on resistance vessels. The benefits of sildenafil seem to occur through restoring the balance<symptom> of ROS/NO/eicosanoids. Therefore , this study opened new avenues for further clinical targeting of the treatment of cardiovascular diseases related to activation of the renin-angiotensin system.
