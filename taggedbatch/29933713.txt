 Background The relative modification of the myocardial volume between end-systole and end-diastole ( ( Formula: see text)) has already been assessed with different methods and falls in a range of 0.9-0.97 ( mean value = 0.93). Purpose To estimate ( Formula: see text) from the three longitudinal ( ( Formula: see text) , circumferential ( ( Formula: see text)) , and radial ( ( Formula: see text)) strains of the left ventricle using the formula: ( Formula: see text) and to test whether this estimate of ( Formula: see text) can be used as a marker of the echocardiography quality. Material and Methods Two hundred manuscripts , including a total of 34,690 patients or healthy volunteers , were identified in the Medline database containing values of ( Formula: see text) , ( Formula: see text) , and ( Formula: see text) measured from echocardiography. Results The median value of was 0.93 , in accordance with the literature , with no significant difference between patients or healthy volunteers ( P = 0.38). The proportion of studies with ( Formula: see text) was 79 %. When only considering groups of healthy volunteers , the studies failing this test had higher standard deviations for the three individual strains: 0.038 vs. 0.029 ( P = 0.02) for ( Formula: see text); 0.060 vs. 0.034 ( P < 10
