 Significance of apoptosis as a prognostic marker is less well studied in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( ALL) cases. Hence , a prospective study , involving 30 paediatric ALL cases , was done to assess the clinical relevance of in vivo apoptosis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from all patients were subjected to annexin V/propidium iodide staining to detect the degree of apoptosis ( apoptotic index ( AI)) at day 0 and day 35 post-induction chemotherapy. In addition , Bax and Bcl2 apoptotic protein expressions were studied at day 0 and their relative fluorescence mean intensity ( RFMI) ratios were calculated. Mean age of patients was 5.1 years. Of the 30 cases , 21 ( 70 %) were at standard-risk , five ( 17 %) at intermediate and four ( 13 %) at high risk. Majority ( 83 %) were B-ALL. Day 8 absolute blast count was > 1000/μl in seven ( 23 %) and < 1000/μl in 23 of 30 ( 77 %) cases. Day 35 marrow was M1 in 23 ( 92 %) and M2 in two of 25 ( 8 %) cases. AI at day 0 and day 35 ranged from 0.9 to16 .6 per cent and 1.4 to 62.8 per cent with a mean of 5.90 and 19.64 per cent , respectively. The Bax/Bcl2 ratio ranged from 0.2 to 3.5 with a mean of 0.83. The ratio was predominantly anti-apoptotic , i.e. < 1 ( 77 %). A significant association was noted between low AI at day 0 and high total leucocyte count ( P = 0.02) , T-cell phenotype ( P = 0.043) and high-risk as per NCI category ( P = 0.025). Significant increase ( > 30 %) in day 35 AI was seen in only six cases. Our study showed that low AI at day 0 was associated with a high-risk clinical phenotype in paediatric ALL. However , studies on larger group , especially with longer follow up or study of relapse cases , will help draw conclusions regarding apoptosis assessment in paediatric ALL.
