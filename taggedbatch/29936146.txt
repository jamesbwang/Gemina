 The National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer 's Association Research Framework on Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) represents an important advance in the biological characterization of the AD spectrum. The National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer 's Association Framework is considered as it applies to clinical trials. Using the combination of amyloid ( A) , tau ( T) , and neurodegeneration ( N) biomarkers , the Framework provides a means of defining the state of patients with regard to Alzheimer pathologic change. The Framework is relevant to clinical trials of disease-modifying agents , allowing participants to be characterized biologically at baseline. The ATN Framework can also inform trial outcomes. The preclinical phase of the disease after amyloid deposition is defined by A+T- N- , and the transition to prodromal disease and dementia is characterized by the addition of T and N. Most symptomatic patients in clinical trials are in the class of A+T+N- and A+T+N +. The National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer 's Association Framework on AD represents progress in providing biomarker profiles of participants in the AD spectrum that can be used to help design clinical trials.
