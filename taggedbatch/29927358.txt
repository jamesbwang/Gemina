 A large number of studies demonstrate that cell mechanics and pathology are intimately linked. In particular , Red Blood Cell ( RBC) deformability is key to their function , and is dramatically altered in the time course of diseases such as anemia<symptom> and malaria<disease>. Due to the physiological importance of cell mechanics , many methods for cell mechanical probing have been developed. While single cell methods provide very valuable information , they are often technically challenging and lack high data throughput needed to distinguish differences in heterogeneous populations , while fluid flow high throughput methods miss the accuracy to detect subtle differences. Here , we present a new method for multiplexed single-cell mechanical probing using Acoustic Force Spectroscopy ( AFS). We demonstrate that mechanical differences induced by chemical treatments of known effect can be measured and quantified. Furthermore , we explore the effect of extracellular-vesicles ( EVs) uptake on RBC mechanics and demonstrate that EVs uptake increases RBC deformability. Our findings demonstrate the ability of AFS to manipulate cells with high stability and precision , and pave the way to further new insights into cellular mechanics and mechanobiology in health and disease , as well as potential biomedical applications.
