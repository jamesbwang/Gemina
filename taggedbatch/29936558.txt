 To determine the threshold signal drop on 3-T chemical shift imaging ( CSI) , with in-phase ( IP) and opposed-phase ( OP) sequences , for accurately identifying bone<disease> marrow replacement with 100 % sensitivity , and determine a clinically useful measurement method for deriving such a threshold. From a convenience series of 157 MRIs , 36 cases with histologically proven marrow-replacing lesions<symptom> and 22 sites of red marrow ( histologically proven ( 2) or with minimum 6-month stability) with 3-Tesla CSI were included. Two musculoskeletal radiologists performed two measurement methods ( first: multiple algorithmic ROIs at the top , middle , and bottom of lesions<symptom> ( M-ROI); second: an ROI was drawn where there appeared to be the least opposed-phase signal reduction qualitatively/visually ( Q-ROI)). Lesional and red marrow signal change ( % , ( ( IP-OP) signal/IP signal) * 100) was determined. Statistical analyses included Student 's t test , Cohen 's kappa , and receiver operator characteristic curve generation. By M-ROI , lesion<symptom> signal change was- 0.508 % ( confidence interval ( CI) =- 5.537:4.521) and 1.348 % ( CI =- 3.541:6.311) for readers 1 and 2. By Q-ROI , lesion<symptom> signal change was- 11.03 % ( CI =- 17.01:- 5.046) and- 5.657 % ( CI =- 12.36:1.048) for readers 1 and 2. For all M-ROI and Q-ROI measurement strategies , signal change between lesional tissue and red marrow was significantly different ( p < 0.0001). QROI produced the best composite sensitivities and specificities with a maximized Youden index of 0.955-1. A threshold signal drop of 25 % with Q-ROI produced at least 100 %/ 86 % sensitivity/specificity for both readers for identifying marrow replacement. For 3-T CSI , a single visually targeted measurement using a 25 % threshold is accurate for identifying marrow-replacing lesions<symptom>.
