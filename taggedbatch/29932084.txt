 Reduced dose schedules may be feasible options to simplify antiretroviral therapy ( ART) in selected HIV-1-infected individuals. Efficacy and safety of a Day-on , Day-off ( DODO) schedule of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , emtricitabine and efavirenz ( FTC/TDF/EFV) single tablet regimen ( STR) was assessed. Twenty-seven patients were prescribed the DODO schedule and were monitored for 48 weeks. Switching criteria were: no previous ART failure , no AIDS-defining illnesses , T CD4 cell nadir > 200/mmc , and HIV-RNA below detection limit ( 40 copies/mL) for at least six months. Clinical and laboratory data , including plasma HIV-RNA levels , T CD4 and CD8 counts , liver and kidney function , lipid levels and ultrasensitive C-reactive protein ( us-CRP) were assessed at baseline , week 4 , 12 , 24 , and 48. Statistical analysis was performed by paired Student 's T-test for comparison between baseline and each time point and Chi square test for CD4/CD8 ratio comparison. In all , 26 out of 27 patients maintained plasma HIV-RNA levels below the detection limit through the entire follow-up. One patient experienced low level plasma HIV-RNA rebound at week 36 ( 47 copies/ml) and immediately reverted to the conventional dose schedule of FTC/TDF/EFV; plasma HIV-RNA was undetectable after four weeks. No major changes on liver and kidney function tests , lipid levels and us-CRP were observed. Although no profound modifications of T CD4 count were observed during follow-up , the CD4/CD8 ratio increased significantly at week 48 compared to the baseline ( p < 0.05). In conclusion , 48-week DODO administration of the fixed dose FTC/TDF/EFV STR combination was safe and effective in maintaining HIV<pathogen> viral replication below the detection limit in a selected group of HIV-1-infected individuals.
