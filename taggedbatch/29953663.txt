 This study assessed the cost consciousness<symptom> of nurses and physicians in German neonatal intensive care units ( NICUs) and identified factors affecting cost consciousness<symptom>. This study on cost consciousness<symptom> was part of the German Safety4NICU study , a cross-sectional survey conducted from 2015 to 2016. All 224 German NICUs were invited to take part in the survey , and written consent was obtained from the leading physicians and nurses. The various professions were addressed via specific questionnaires. The cost survey tool identified the participants ' responsibility and their desired focus on cost consciousness<symptom>. Of the 1406 nurses and 496 physicians from 84 NICUs , 64.4 % of the nurses and 62.5 % of the physicians agreed that they shared responsibility for controlling costs. The computed score to define the overall cost consciousness<symptom> level was 4.47. We identified a significantly positive association between cost consciousness<symptom> , longer total clinical work experience and a decreased number of NICU intensive care beds. Increased cost consciousness<symptom> was found in both men and physicians. Other hospital characteristics did not have an effect. Neonatology is a medical speciality where the tension between economics and the benefit of patients is extremely high. We found a moderate level of cost consciousness<symptom> among NICU physicians and nurses.
