 Although the deregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) is one of the most common molecular mechanisms of glioblastoma ( GBM) pathogenesis , the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy is limited. Additionally , response to anti-EGFR therapy is not solely dependent on EGFR expression and is more promising in patients with reduced activity of EGFR downstream signaling pathways. Thus , there is considerable interest in identifying the compensatory regulatory factors of the EGFR signaling pathway to improve the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapies for GBM. In this study , we confirmed the low efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in GBM patients by meta-analysis. Then we identified a negative correlation between Connexin 43 ( Cx43) expression and Akt/ERK activation which was caused by the direct interactions between Akt/ERK and Cx43. By comparing the interactions between Akt/ERK and Cx43 using a series of truncated and mutated Cx43 variants , we revealed that the residues T286/A305/Q308/ Y313 and S272/S273 at the carboxy terminus of Cx43 are critical for its binding with Akt and ERK , respectively. In addition , Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using data from TCGA datasets indicated that the expression of Cx43 significantly improved the prognosis of GBM patients who express EGFR. Altogether , our results suggested that Cx43 acts as an inhibitory regulator of the activation of growth factor receptor downstream signaling pathways , indicating the potential of Cx43 as a marker for predicting the efficacy of EGFR inhibitor treatments for GBM. Targeting the interaction between the carboxy terminus of Cx43 and Akt/ERK may thus be an effective therapeutic strategy against GBM. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
