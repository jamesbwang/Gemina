 A highly site-selective amidation reaction of substituted 2,4-dichloroazines is reported. Palladium acetate/1 ,1 '- bis ( diphenylphosphino) ferrocene ( dppf) was identified as the optimal catalyst system , producing > 99:1 C-2/ C-4 selectivity for most examples. The generality of this transformation was demonstrated through a survey of a diverse amide/substituted 2,4-dichloroazine scope , leading to the preparation of the desired C-2 amidated products in good to excellent yields.
