The authors performed a retrospective assessment of their experience with bioengineered skin<symptom> to possibly identify the most appropriate clinical indication and management for each substitute. The study involved 109 patients with 127 skin defects repaired with dermal substitutes over a 9 years period , from 2007 to 2016.
