 High doses of Î²-phenylethyl isothiocyanate ( PEITC) , a phytochemical in cruciferous vegetables , are not feasible for consumption due to a strong mouth-tingling effect. This study investigated the anti-cancer effect of PEITC at sensory acceptable doses. In vitro , PEITC was selectively toxic to oral cancer cells ( CAL-27 , FaDu , SCC4 , SCC 9 , SCC15 , SCC25 and TU138) , compared to oral keratinocytes ( OKF6/TERT2 and NOK/Si). In vivo , 5 and 10 mg kg-1 PEITC , equivalent to human organoleptically acceptable doses , retarded tumor growth and prolonged the survival of mice bearing p53-mutated oral cancer cells- TU138 xenograft. Mechanistically , PEITC induced ROS accumulation , nuclear translocation of p53 and p21 and G1/S cell cycle arrest in vitro; increased p53 and 8-oxo-dG levels; and decreased Ki-67 intense/mild staining ratios without TUNEL changes in vivo. These findings suggested that the sensory acceptable doses of PEITC selectively induced ROS-mediated cell cycle arrest leading to delayed tumor progression and extended survival. PEITC could be a functional ingredient for oral cancer prevention.
