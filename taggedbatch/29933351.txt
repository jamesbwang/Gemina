 Knowledge of hip biomechanics during locomotion is necessary for designing optimal rehabilitation programs for hip-related conditions. The purpose of this study was to: ( 1) determine how lower-limb muscle contributions to hip<symptom> joint contact forces ( HCFs) differed between walking and running; and ( 2) compare both absolute and per-unit-distance ( PUD) loads at the hip during walking and running. Kinematic and ground reaction force data were captured from eight healthy participants during overground walking and running at various steady-state speeds ( walking: 1.50 ± 0.11 m/s and 1.98 ± 0.03 m/s; running: 2.15 ± 0.18 m/s and 3.47 ± 0.11 m/s). A three-dimensional musculoskeletal model was used to calculate HCFs as well as lower-limb muscular contributions to HCFs in each direction ( posterior-anterior; inferior-superior; lateral-medial). The impulse of the resultant HCF was calculated as well as the PUD impulse ( BW.s/ m) and PUD force ( BW/m). For both walking and running , HCF magnitude was greater during stance than swing , and was largest in the inferior-superior direction and smallest in the posterior-anterior direction. Gluteus medius , iliopsoas and gluteus maximus generated the largest contributions to the HCF during stance , whereas iliopsoas and hamstrings generated the largest contributions during swing. When comparing all locomotion conditions , the impulse of the resultant HCF was smallest for running at 2.15 m/s with an average magnitude of 2.14 ± 0.31 BW.s , whereas the PUD impulse and force were smallest for running at 3.47 m/s with average magnitudes of 0.95 ± 0.18 BW.s/ m and 1.25 ± 0.24 BW/m , respectively. Hip PUD loads were lower for running at 3.47 m/s compared to all other locomotion conditions because of a greater distance travelled per stride ( PUD impulse) or a shorter stride duration combined with a greater distance travelled per stride ( PUD force).
