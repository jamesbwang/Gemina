 Epidemiological and biological arguments put papillomavirus<pathogen> infection ( HPV<pathogen>) as a determining factor in the etiology of cervical cancer. The main objective of this study is to assess the knowledge , attitudes and practices related to HPV<pathogen> prevention and cervical cancer screening among women living in the city of Sousse , Tunisia. Five hundred Tunisian women were interviewed face to face between May and June 2016. The questionnaire consisted in 14 questions relating participants ' socio-demographic information , their awareness level , attitudes and practices regarding HPV<pathogen> and cervical cancer , including their understanding of the underlying cervical cancer etiology and preventive actions such as the Pap Smear test , and finally their acceptability and willingness to receive the anti-HPV vaccine under certain circumstances. Multivariate analyses were conducted to identify predictive factors of good acceptability of cervical cancer prevention methods. Four hundred fifty-two questionnaires were completed and included in the analysis. The awareness of a sexually transmitted infection as an etiological agent for cervical cancer was expressed by 175 ( 38.7 %) participants , the correct finality of the Pap Smear test by 308 ( 68 %) and its recommended frequency by 176 ( 38.9 %) respondents. Among all participants , 125 ( 27.7 %) had undertaken the Pap Smear test at least once in their lifetime , 363 ( 80.3 %) were interested in receiving the anti-HPV vaccine for themselves , 387 ( 86 %) for their daughters and 405 ( 90 %) approved the introduction of the anti-HPV vaccine in the Tunisian national program of vaccination. The knowledge and awareness of HPV<pathogen> infection and cervical cancer among Tunisian women was found to be moderate ( around 40 %) and the acceptability of the anti-HPV vaccine was found to be high ( over 80 %). These results are concordant with the results of other studies conducted in other MENA countries.
