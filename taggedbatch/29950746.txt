 Volcanic eruptions have global climate impacts , but their effect on the hydrologic cycle is poorly understood. We use a modified version of superposed epoch analysis , an eruption year list collated from multiple datasets , and seasonal paleoclimate reconstructions ( soil moisture , precipitation , geopotential heights , and temperature) to investigate volcanic forcing of spring and summer hydroclimate over Europe and the Mediterranean over the last millennium. In the western Mediterranean , wet conditions occur in the eruption year and the following 3 years. Conversely , northwestern Europe and the British Isles experience dry conditions in response to volcanic eruptions , with the largest moisture deficits in post-eruption years 2 and 3. The precipitation response occurs primarily in late spring and early summer ( April-July) , a pattern that strongly resembles the negative phase of the East Atlantic Pattern. Modulated by this mode of climate variability , eruptions force significant , widespread , and heterogeneous hydroclimate responses across Europe and the Mediterranean.
