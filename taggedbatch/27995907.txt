 Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) is among the most fatal types of cancer worldwide due to its high rates of recurrence and metastasis. The molecular processes involved in HCC progression require further investigation to identify biomarkers for use in diagnosis and treatment. In the present study , the significance and prognostic value of matrix metallopeptidase 12 ( MMP12) expression in human HCC was investigated. MMP12 mRNA expression was investigated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of 42 pairs of tumor and non-tumor liver tissues obtained from patients with HCC following surgical treatment. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect MMP12 and forkhead box P3 ( FOXP3) expression in 158 paraffin-embedded HCC tissues. The prognostic value of MMP12 expression was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model. MMP12 mRNA levels were significantly higher in liver tumor tissues compared with matched non-tumor liver tissues. MMP12 expression and FOXP3
