 Clinical guidelines recommend at least 3-months low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH) treatment for established venous thromboembolism ( VTE) in cancer patients. However , no study has analyzed the impact of 3-6 months of LMWH therapy on quality-of-life ( QoL) in cancer patients. Among 400 cancer patients included at M0 , 88.8 % received long-term LMWH. Using a random-effects linear regression model with time as covariate , QoL scores in the MOS SF-36 ( Global HRQoL , 1.3-fold per month ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.81-1.79) , QUAVITEC , a prospective , longitudinal , multicenter study , recruited all consecutive eligible adult cancer patients with objectively confirmed VTE between February 2011 and 2012. Patients were asked to answer three QoL questionnaires at anticoagulant treatment initiation ( M0) and at 3 ( M3) and 6 ( M6)- month follow-ups. QUAVITEC is the first study to show that QoL was improved in cancer patients receiving long-term LMWH treatment for established VTE.
