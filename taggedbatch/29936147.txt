 Cognitive function is an important end point of treatments in dementia clinical trials. Measuring cognitive function by standardized tests , however , is biased toward highly constrained environments ( such as hospitals) in selected samples. Patient-powered real-world evidence using information and communication technology devices , including environmental and wearable sensors , may help to overcome these limitations. This position paper describes current and novel information and communication technology devices and algorithms to monitor behavior and function in people with prodromal and manifest stages of dementia continuously , and discusses clinical , technological , ethical , regulatory , and user-centered requirements for collecting real-world evidence in future randomized controlled trials. Challenges of data safety , quality , and privacy and regulatory requirements need to be addressed by future smart sensor technologies. When these requirements are satisfied , these technologies will provide access to truly user relevant outcomes and broader cohorts of participants than currently sampled in clinical trials.
