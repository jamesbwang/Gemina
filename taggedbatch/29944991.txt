 The present study aims to investigate whether problem-focused and emotion-focused coping skills were associated with suicidal ideation. In addition , we examined whether childhood maltreatment ( i.e. physical , psychological , sexual abuse , and neglect) is a risk factor for later-on suicidal ideation. Youths aged 16 or 18 ( n = 307 , 56 % females) from San Diego and Seattle at Wave 6 and Wave 7 of the LONGSCAN were included in the study. We used hierarchical logistic regression. 17.6 % reported suicidal ideation. Those who reported better emotion-focused coping were .80 times less likely to report suicidal ideation. However , even after controlling for coping skills , adolescents with sexually abuse histories were 3.08 times more likely to report suicidal ideation. Our findings suggest implications for early intervention efforts. Building youth assets through promotion of positive youth development may serve as a driving force to reduce negative outcomes in youth who have experienced sexual abuse.
