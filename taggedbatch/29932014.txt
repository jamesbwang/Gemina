 To examine the association between obesity and knee and hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis across a range of physical performance. The body mass index and physical performance ( on the 36-item Short Form Health Survey) of 9135 Australian Diabetes , Obesity and Lifestyle Study participants were measured in 1999-2000. The incidence of knee and hip arthroplasty during 2002-2011 was determined by linking the cohort records to the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry. Over 9.1 ± 2.3 years ( mean ± sd)) of follow-up , 317 participants had knee and 202 had hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. Using those with neither obesity nor significantly impaired physical performance as the reference group , participants with both obesity and significantly impaired physical performance had a higher knee arthroplasty risk ( hazard ratio ( HR) = 5.25 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 3.85-7.14) than those with obesity alone ( HR = 2.49 , 95 % CI 1.81-3.44) or impaired physical performance alone ( HR = 2.19 , 95 % CI 1.59-3.02). Similar results were observed for hip arthroplasty ( obesity and impaired physical performance: HR = 2.67 , 95 % CI 1.72-4.15; obesity alone: HR = 1.65 , 95 % CI 1.08-2.51; impaired physical performance alone: HR = 1.83 , 95 % CI 1.26-2.66). Among overweight/obese patients , 5 kg greater baseline weight increased the knee arthroplasty risk across all levels of physical performance , and hip arthroplasty risk in those with the highest level of physical performance. Although impaired physical performance is an independent risk factor for knee and hip arthroplasty , greater weight increased knee arthroplasty for overweight/obese participants at all levels of physical performance , but hip arthroplasty only in those with good physical performance. Targeting weight<symptom> loss<symptom> has the potential to reduce the risk of knee arthroplasty and improve patient outcomes , even in those with poor physical performance.
