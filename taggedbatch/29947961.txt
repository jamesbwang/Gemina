 Tumor relapse and metastatic spreading act as major hindrances to achieve complete cure of breast cancer. Evidence suggests that cancer stem cells ( CSC) would function as a reservoir for the local and distant recurrence of the disease , due to their resistance to radio- and chemotherapy and their ability to regenerate the tumor. Therefore , the identification of appropriate molecular targets expressed by CSC may be critical in the development of more effective therapies. Our studies focused on the identification of mammary CSC antigens and on the development of CSC-targeting vaccines. We compared the transcriptional profile of CSC-enriched tumorspheres from an Her2
