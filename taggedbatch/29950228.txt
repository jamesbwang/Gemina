 To study the mechanism and clinical value of miR-373 in multiple myeloma. The expressions of miR-373 in multiple myeloma cells and normal plasma cells were detected by RT-PCR , and the biological function of miR-373 in tumor was analyzed by MTT assay , flow cytometry , luciferase experiment and tumorgenesis experiment. The miR-373 expression levels in MM patients and multiple myeloma cell lines ( H929 , MM1S and U266) were significantly lower than that in normal plasma cells detected by using RT-PCR ( P < 0.05). The proliferations of U266 and H929 cells transfected with miR-373 were significantly suppressed ( P < 0.05); the cell cycle of H929 cell transfected with miR-373 was arrested in the G miR-373 inhibits tumor growth in MM by direct targeting FOXM1 , thus miR-373 shows an important clinical significance for the treatment of MM.
