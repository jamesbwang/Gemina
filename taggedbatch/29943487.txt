 Working with thiols is associated with the risk of unwanted oxidation reactions , which includes the formation of disulfides. Here , the use of short peptidomimetic oligoureas as a model system to study the influence of reaction conditions on the thiol oxidation process is described. The formation of disulfide bond is usually performed in aqueous solutions; in this study , it was shown that the oxidation reaction occurs also in organic medium. It was discovered that the rate of the oxidation reaction strongly depends on the type of solvent , which is the consequence of the change of the oxidant ( air or DMSO) , the temperature , and the presence ( or absence) of base. The details reported here may help those working with thiols to find suitable conditions to control the oxidation behaviour in organic solvents , ensuring that â”€ SH groups either remain intact or form disulfide bonds as desired.
