 The distinction between Primary Progressive Aphasia<symptom> ( PPA) variants remains challenging for clinicians , especially for the non-fluent ( nfv-PPA) and the logopenic variants ( lv-PPA). Previous research suggests that memory tests might aid this differentiation. This meta-analysis compares memory function among PPA variants. Effects sizes were extracted from 41 studies ( N = 849). Random-effects models were used to compare performance on episodic and working memory tests among PPA patients and healthy controls , and between the PPA variants. Memory deficits were frequently observed in PPA compared to controls , with large effect sizes for lv-PPA ( Hedges ' g = -2.04 ( -2.58 to -1.49)) , nfv-PPA ( Hedges ' g = -1.26 ( ( -1.60 to -0.92) , p < .001)) , and the semantic variant ( sv-PPA; Hedges ' g = -1.23 ( -1.50 to -0.97)). Sv-PPA showed primarily verbal memory deficits , whereas lv-PPA showed worse performance than nfv-PPA on both verbal and non-verbal memory tests. Memory deficits were more pronounced in lv-PPA compared to nfv-PPA. This suggests that memory tests may be helpful to distinguish between these PPA variants.
