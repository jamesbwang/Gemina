 A green and sustainable methodology for the synthesis of isoquinolines using Ru ( ii)/ PEG-400 as a homogeneous recyclable catalytic system has been demonstrated. N-Tosylhydrazone , a rarely explored directing group , has been successfully employed for an annulation type of reaction with alkynes via C-H/N-N activation. A short reaction time with a simple extraction procedure , a wide substrate scope with high yields of products , easily prepared substrates , biodegradable solvent , and scalability up to the gram level enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the proposed protocol. Further , the expensive ruthenium-based homogeneous catalytic system could be reused up to a fourth consecutive cycle without any loss in its activity.
