 Spherical molecularly imprinted polymers ( MIPs) were prepared by emulsion polymerization. The isothermal adsorption and selective adsorption indicated that the MIPs obtained exhibit excellent specific recognition for the template ( atrazine) and its analogues. The MIPs were encapsulated in a polypropylene microporous membrane to fabricate MIP adsorption packages for the direct extraction of triazines in uncentrifuged and unfiltered tea extracts. The extraction conditions affecting the extraction efficiency , including the type and volume of extraction solvent , the number of MIP adsorption packages , the surface area of the MIP adsorption packages , the mass of MIPs in the MIP adsorption packages , the extraction time , the eluting solvent , and the eluting volume , were optimized. Under the optimal extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry conditions , the method exhibited excellent linearity in the range from 0.5 to 250 ng g
