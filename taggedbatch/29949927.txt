 The proliferation of Internet-of-Things ( IoT) technology and its reliance on the license-free Industrial , Scientific , and Medical ( ISM) bands have rendered radio spectrum scarce. The IoT can nevertheless obtain great advantage from Cognitive Radio ( CR) technology for efficient use of a spectrum , to be implemented in IEEE 802.11af-based primary networks. However , such networks require a geolocation database and a centralized architecture to communicate white space information on channels. On the other hand , in spectrum sensing , CR presents various challenges such as the Hidden Primary Terminal ( HPT) problem. To this end , we focus on the most recently released standard , i.e. , IEEE 802.11 ah , in which IoT stations can first be classified into multiple groups to reduce collisions and then they can periodically access the channel. Therein , both services are similarly supported by a centralized server that requires signaling overhead to control the groups of stations. In addition , more regroupings are required over time due to the frequent variations in the number of participating stations , which leads to more overhead. In this paper , we propose a new Multiple Access Control ( MAC) protocol for CR-based IEEE 802.11 ah systems , called Restricted Access with Collision and Interference Resolution ( RACIR). We introduce a decentralized group split algorithm that distributes the participating stations into multiple groups based on a probabilistic estimation in order to resolve collisions. Furthermore , we propose a decentralized channel access procedure that avoids the HPT problem and resolves interference with the incumbent receiver. We analyze the performance of our proposed MAC protocol in terms of normalized throughput , packet delay and energy consumption with the Markov model and analytic expressions. The results are quite promising , which makes the RACIR protocol a strong candidate for the CR-based IoT environment.
