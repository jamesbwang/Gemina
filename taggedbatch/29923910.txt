 To test whether environmental hypoxia could potentiate the effects of exercise training on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Fourteen adolescents with obesity were assigned to 6 weeks of exercise training either in normoxic or in hypoxic conditions ( FiO2 15 %). Adolescents trained 3x/w for 50-60min , including endurance and resistance exercises. Oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT) , blood and morphological analyses as well as physical performance tests were performed before and after the training period. After training , hypoxia , but not normoxia , decreased the area under the curve of plasma insulin ( -49 %; p = 0.001) and glucose levels ( -14 %; p = 0.005) during OGTT. Decreased plasma triglycerides levels ( p = 0.03) and increased maximal aerobic power ( p = 0.002) , work capacity at 160 beats/min ( p = 0.002) and carbohydrate consumption during exercise ( p = 0.03) were measured only in the hypoxic group. Hypoxic exercise training was particularly efficient at improving glucose tolerance and insulin response to a glucose challenge in adolescents with obesity. These results suggest that exercise training in hypoxia could be an interesting strategy against insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes development in adolescents with obesity.
