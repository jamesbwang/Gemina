 This paper presents the results of research into pathways leading to the production of methane ( CH4) and carbon dioxide ( CO2) in sediments of two eutrophic reservoirs ( Maziarnia and Nielisz) , located in south-eastern Poland. In seeking to identify the pathways in question , use was made of analysis of stable carbon isotopes in CH4 and CO2 dissolved in pore water. This determined that CH4 is mainly produced through acetate fermentation , though the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic process may also be of importance , especially in deeper layers of sediments. Both the presence of autochthonous organic matter and increased pH values are shown to favour acetate fermentation. In turn , methanogenesis in sediments is assessed as capable of accounting for the generation of a considerable amount of CO2. Indeed , the role of methanogenesis in CO2 production is increasingly important further down in the layers of sediment , where allochthonous organic matter is predominant.
