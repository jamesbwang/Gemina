 Emphysematous destruction of lung parenchyma visible in computed tomography ( CT) can be attributed to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) or to α1-antitrypsin deficiency ( AATD). We evaluated if visual semiquantitative phenotyping of CT data helps identifying individuals with AATD in a group of smokers with severe emphysema and airflow limitation. n = 14 patients with AATD and n = 15 with COPD and a minimum of 10 pack years underwent CT , clinical assessment , and full-body plethysmography. The extent and type of emphysema as well as large and small airway changes were rated semiquantitatively for each lobe using a standardized previously published scoring system. Lastly , a final diagnosis for each patient was proposed. AATD had a significantly lower mean emphysema score than COPD , with 8.9 ± 3.4 versus 11.9 ± 3.2 ( p < 0.001) , respectively. Within both groups , there was significantly more emphysema in the lower lobes ( p < 0.05-0.001). The COPD group showed an upper- and middle-lobe predominance of emphysema distribution when compared to the AATD group ( p < 0.001). Centrilobular ( CLE) and panlobular ( PLE) emphysema patterns showed a uniform distribution within both groups , with a CLE predominance in the upper lung and a PLE predominance in the lower lung regions. AATD and COPD both showed significantly more airway changes in lower lobes compared to upper lobes ( p = 0.05-0.001) , without significant differences between both groups. The typical emphysema distribution patterns seen on CT traditionally assigned to AATD and COPD were of little use in discriminating both entities. Also , airway changes could not contribute to a more precise differentiation. We conclude that a concise standardized phenotyping-driven approach to chest CT in emphysema is not sufficient to identify patients with AATD in a cohort of smokers with advanced emphysema.
