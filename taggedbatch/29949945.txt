 The Wnt- and BMP-rich cortical hem has been demonstrated to be critical for the pattern formation of the telencephalon , and it is particularly important for the induction of the hippocampus. Meanwhile , the cortical hem is one of the sources of Cajal-Retzius cells. Many Cajal-Retzius cells are produced in the hem and populated to the media-caudal surface of the telencephalon. However , the mechanism of the maintenance of the hem remain unclear. In this study , we generated a transgenic mouse line
