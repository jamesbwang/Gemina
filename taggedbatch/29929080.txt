 Four undescribed 23,24-O-isopropylidene-19 ( 18 â†’ 17)- abeo-28-noroleanane-derived spirocyclic triterpenoids and an undescribed 28-noroleanane-derived spirocyclic triterpenoid , together with five known 28-noroleanane-derived spirocyclic triterpenoids , were isolated and identified. In addition , three undescribed iridoid glucosides and four known ones were also identified. All the isolates were identified using spectroscopic techniques , and the absolute configurations of 28-noroleanane-derived spirocyclic triterpenoids were determined by CD method for the first time. Additionally , the alkaline hydrolysis method and HPLC analysis were applied to confirm the moieties of the iridoid glucosides. The fraction and isolates were evaluated for cytotoxic activity on cervical cancer ( Hela) , human promyelocytic leukemia<disease> ( HL-60) , and breast cancer ( MCF-7) cell lines. Among them , phlomisu E possessed an aldehyde group showed the most potent cytotoxic effect with IC
