 Regardless of acceptable surgical results of middle cerebral artery aneurysms<disease> ( MCAs) , MCA territory infarction ( MCATI) remains a major obstacle to achieving a good outcome. We investigated the MCATI in patients with surgically treated MCA aneurysms<disease>. The data of 286 consecutive patients with 322 MCA aneurysms<disease> were evaluated retrospectively. The aneurysm<disease> location was classified as early frontal cortical branch ( EFCB) , early temporal cortical branch ( ETCB) , bifurcation or trifurcation ( M1-2) , and distal aneurysms<disease> on the insular , opercular , or cortical segments of the MCA ( distal MCA). Neurologic worsening was defined as an increase in 1 or more modified Rankin Scale ( mRS) scores. Multivariate analysis identified EFCB location as the sole risk factor for MCATI ( odds ratio ( OR) , 3.8; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.2-12; P = 0.021) and MCATI ( OR , 18; 95 % CI , 2.8-117; P = 0.002) and a larger size ratio ( OR , 1.4; 95 % CI , 1.1-1.8; P = 0.019) were related to 12-month neurologic worsening ( n = 6; 1.9 %). During follow-up ( median , 885 days; interquartile range , 485-1229 days) , posttreatment rupture and aneurysm<disease> recurrence were not observed. In the present study , compared with M1-2 aneurysms<disease> , MCATIs were observed more frequently in EFCB aneurysms<disease> , and the presence of MCATI and a larger size ratio were related to 12-month neurologic worsening in patients with surgically treated MCA aneurysms<disease>.
