 The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased , mainly due to the incidental finding of low-risk papillary thyroid cancers ( PTC). These malignancies grow slowly , and are unlikely to cause morbidity and mortality. New understanding about the prognosis of tumor features has led to reclassification of many tumors within the low-risk thyroid category , and to the development of a new one `` very low-risk tumors. '' Alternative less aggressive approaches to therapy are now available including active surveillance and minimally invasive interventions. In this narrative review , we have summarized the available evidence for the management of low-risk PTC.
