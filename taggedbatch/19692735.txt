 We aimed to describe time trends in functional dyspepsia and the association of dyspepsia-related factors , Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori ( H.<pathogen> pylori) and work-related stress with functional dyspepsia in white collar employees in 1996 and 2015. Repeat cross-sectional study conducted in 1996 ( n = 190 , response rate = 76.1) and 2015 ( n = 195 , response rate = 40.2) within a health insurance company in South-West Germany. Dyspeptic symptoms measured according to the Rome III criteria , effort-reward imbalance and further work- or dyspepsia-related factors were assessed by self-administered questionnaire. H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection as possible factor for dyspeptic symptoms was measured by a 13C-urea breath test or an antigen stool<symptom> test. Kruskal-Wallis tests and multivariable logistic regression models were calculated comparing the upper tertile of dyspeptic symptom scale to the middle and lower tertile. Mean dyspepsia symptom scores and work-related stress did not differ comparing 1996 and 2015. In bivariate analyses , dyspeptic symptom scores were consistently correlated with sex , age , and using antacids. Further dyspepsia-related factors were smoking and non-leading occupational position in 1996 and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as well as high effort-reward imbalance in 2015. High intrinsic effort was positively associated with high dyspepsia symptom scores in both studies. Following multivariable adjustment , we observed a consistent association between high intrinsic effort at work and dyspeptic symptoms , although the association was only marginally statistically significant in 1996. Furthermore , a strong association of somatization , only measured in 2015 , with dyspeptic symptoms was shown. Dyspepsia-related factors may have changed throughout the last decades. Nevertheless , although occupational situations might differ , the intrinsic effort is still strongly associated with dyspeptic symptoms.
