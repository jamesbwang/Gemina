 In this study , we characterised PgpdA , PgpdA2B , PgpdA3B and PgpdA4B promoters , containing 1-4 copies of gpd box by modifying the gpdA promoter , and constructed pSZHGX-xynB expression vectors , which were introduced into Aspergillus<pathogen> niger CICC2462 through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Thus , An ( PgpdA-xynB) , An ( PgpdA2B-xynB) , An ( PgpdA3B-xynB) and An ( PgpdA4B-xynB) homozygous recombinant strains were obtained. The xylanase activity of homozygous recombinant strains was measured. The enzymatic activities of An ( PgpdA-xynB) , An ( PgpdA2B-xynB) , An ( PgpdA3B-xynB) and An ( PgpdA4B-xynB) peaked on the 7th day of fermentation , at 1578.67 , 2333.88 , 3588.38 and 3183.51 U Â· mL-1 , respectively. SDS-PAGE and qRT-PCR analysis indicated that An ( PgpdA3B-xynB) , containing three copies of gpd box , demonstrated the highest levels of protein expression and transcription. These results suggested that the PgpdA3B promoter promotes highly efficient transcription and may serve as a strong constitutive promoter for efficient recombinant protein expression. Additionally , a number of constitutive promoters with various transcription efficiencies were identified for the metabolic engineering of A.<pathogen> niger. Accordingly , this study provides a new approach for obtaining promoters with different transcription efficiencies.
