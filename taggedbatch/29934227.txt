 Guidelines recommend lifestyle modification and medications to control risk factors in coronary heart disease ( CHD). Using data from the observational DYSIS II study , we sought to evaluate the use of guideline-recommended treatments at discharge for acute coronary syndromes<disease><symptom> ( ACS) or in the chronic phase for CHD , and participation in rehabilitation/secondary prevention programs. Between 2013 and 2014 , 10,661 patients ( 3867 with ACS , 6794 with stable CHD) were enrolled in 332 primary and secondary care centers in 18 countries ( Asia , Europe , Middle<pathogen> East). Patients with incident ACS were younger and more likely to be smokers than patients with recurrent ACS or stable CHD ( both p < 0.0001). Sedentary lifestyle was common ( 44.4 % of ACS patients; 44.2 % of stable CHD patients); 22.8 % of ACS patients and 24.3 % of stable CHD patients were obese. Prevalence of low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( < 40 mg/dL in men/50 mg/dL in women) was 46.9 % in chronic CHD and 55.0 % in ACS. Rates of secondary prevention medications were lower among CHD versus ACS ( all p < 0.0001): antiplatelet 94.3 % vs 98.0 % , beta-blocker 72.0 % vs 80.0 % , lipid-lowering therapy 94.7 vs 97.5 % , and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers 69.4 % vs 73.7 % , respectively. Attendance at cardiac rehabilitation ( 16.8 % of patients with a first ACS , 10.8 % with recurrent ACS) or a secondary prevention program ( 3.7 % of ACS and 11.7 % of stable CHD patients) was infrequent. The high prevalence of risk factors in all CHD patients and reduced rates of secondary prevention medications in stable CHD offer areas for improvement. The findings of DYSIS II may reinforce the importance of adopting a healthy lifestyle and prescribing ( by clinicians) and adhering ( by patients) to evidence-based medications in the management of CHD , not only during the short term but also over the longer term after a cardiac ischemic event. The results may help to increase the proportion of ACS patients who are referred to cardiac rehabilitation centres.
