 We present a nonlinear light scattering method for monitoring , with real-time resolution and membrane specificity , changes in molecular adsorption , and transport at bacterial membranes<symptom> induced by an antimicrobial compound. Specifically , time-resolved second-harmonic light scattering ( SHS) is used to quantify azithromycin-induced changes to bacterial membrane permeability in colloidal suspensions of living
