 We report a case of immunoglobulin ( Ig) D<pathogen> myeloma with hidden lambda light chains in a patient whose immunofixation test was very difficult to interpret: the IgD reacts with the anti-δ heavy chain antiserum but does not react with anti-lambda antiserum. The band in the D heavy chain lane is unmatched in light chain lanes and the band in lambda light chain lane migrates higher. To distinguish between heavy chain disease and immunoglobulin with `` hidden '' light chains , the sample was exposed to a very high concentration of anti-lambda and anti-kappa antisera for 48 hours. The serum immunofixation test of the sample treated with anti-lambda showed a decrease in the intensity of the band corresponding to D heavy chain lane as well as the modification of its mobility confirming the presence of IgD with the hidden lambda light chains. The IgD myeloma with hidden light chains remains a rare entity , hence the interest of sensitizing health professionals to be vigilant and ensure a good diagnosis. The proposed technique is useful , simple , reliable , and less laborious than those previous reported in the literature. Medical laboratories using Sebia-Hydrasys ® system should be aware of the described phenomenon in order to avoid identifying an IgD myeloma as a delta heavy chain disease.
