 Survivors of childhood cancer are at significant risk for serious chronic health conditions and subsequent cancers because of their prior treatment exposures. However , little is known about survivors ' perceptions of their future health risks. This study examined self-reported levels of concern about future health and subsequent cancer in 15,620 adult survivors of childhood cancer ( median age , 26 years; median time since diagnosis , 17 years) and 3991 siblings in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. The prevalence of concerns was compared between survivors and siblings , and the impact of participant characteristics and treatment exposures on concerns was examined with multivariable modified Poisson regression to estimate relative risks ( RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). A substantial proportion of survivors were not concerned about their future health ( 31 %) or developing cancer ( 40 %). The prevalence of concern in survivors was modestly higher ( RR for future health , 1.12; 95 % CI , 1.09-1.15) or similar ( RR for subsequent cancer , 1.02; 95 % CI , 0.99-1.05) in comparison with siblings. Survivors exposed to high doses of radiation ( ≥ 20 Gy) were more likely to report concern ( RR for future health , 1.13; 95 % CI , 1.09-1.16; RR for subsequent cancer , 1.14; 95 % CI , 1.10-1.18) , but 35 % of these high-risk survivors were not concerned about developing cancer , and 24 % were not concerned about their future health. A substantial subgroup of survivors were unconcerned about their future health and subsequent cancer risks , even after exposure to treatments associated with increased risk. These survivors may be less likely to engage in beneficial screening and risk-reduction activities. Cancer 2018. © 2018 American Cancer Society.
