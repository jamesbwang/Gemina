 ABSTRACTBackground: The mobile screening test system for screening mild cognitive impairment ( mSTS-MCI) was developed for clinical use. However , the clinical usefulness of mSTS-MCI to detect elderly with MCI from those who are cognitively healthy has yet to be validated. Moreover , the comparability between this system and traditional screening tests for MCI has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to examine the validity and reliability of the mSTS-MCI and confirm the cut-off scores to detect MCI. The data were collected from 107 healthy elderly people and 74 elderly people with MCI. Concurrent validity was examined using the Korean version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA-K) as a gold standard test , and test-retest reliability was investigated using 30 of the study participants at four-week intervals. The sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , and negative predictive value ( NPV) were confirmed through Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC) analysis , and the cut-off scores for elderly people with MCI were identified. Concurrent validity showed statistically significant correlations between the mSTS-MCI and MoCA-K and test-rests reliability indicated high correlation. As a result of screening predictability , the mSTS-MCI had a higher NPV than the MoCA-K. The mSTS-MCI was identified as a system with a high degree of validity and reliability. In addition , the mSTS-MCI showed high screening predictability , indicating it can be used in the clinical field as a screening test system for mild cognitive impairment.
