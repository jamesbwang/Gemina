 Spermatid perinuclear RNA-binding protein ( Strbp) is a kind of double-stranded ( ds) RNA specific binding protein that plays important roles in mammalian spermatogenesis. In this study , we have isolated and characterized the strbp gene of Chinese tongue sole , Cynoglossus semilaevis , termed as CS-strbp. The CS-strbp genomic sequence contained fifteen exons and fourteen introns. Its cDNA was 2655 bp in length , encoding a 666-amino-acid protein with two conserved ds binding motifs. Using quantitative PCR , we found that CS-strbp mRNA exhibited sex-biased and tissue-specific distribution , predominantly expressed in the fertile male testis , though the expression levels varied throughout different developmental stages. Comparison of methylation profile in different sexual genotypes demonstrated the low methylation level of CS-strbp promoter in male and pseudo-male , which is consistent with the high expression levels in those genotypes. In situ hybridization revealed that CS-strbp mRNA mainly localized in male germ cells , especially in spermatids and spermatozoa. Given these findings , we postulate that CS-strbp might function in spermatogenesis of Chinese tongue sole.
