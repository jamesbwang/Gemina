 To describe variation in utilization and costs of inpatient care for patients with kidney stones , examining associations with older age. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample we examined inpatient discharges with stone diagnoses from 2007-11. We examined length of stay , hospitalization cost , and post-discharge care utilization using multivariable regression to identify associations between patient/hospital characteristics and resource. An estimated 1.7 million hospital discharges for stone disease occurred during the study period. Median length of stay was 2.1 days with a median cost of $ 6300. Hospital use was substantially higher among persons â‰¥ 65 years old ( older adults) as compared to those aged 18-64 ( younger adults): median length of stay was 3.1 days , with 25 % staying more than 5.9 days. Older adults were significantly more likely to utilize home health ( OR 3.6) or skilled nursing ( OR 5.0) after discharge. Older adults accounted for 1 in 3 hospital discharges , 40 % of costs , and half of post-discharge care utilization. They were more likely to be septic during hospitalization ( OR 1.8) which doubled costs per episode , but less likely to receive surgery ( OR 0.93). While historically at lower risk for kidney stones compared to younger adults , older adults utilizing inpatient care account for a disproportionate share of the economic burden of disease. Utilization is higher for older adults across multiple dimensions , including hospital costs , length of stay , and post-discharge care. These findings suggest that efforts to understand and mitigate the impact of kidney stones on this vulnerable population are required.
