 Arthropod-borne virus<disease> disease<disease> cycles constitute interactions among three primary players-the host , the vector , and the virus-in which the virus needs to interact with the host and the vector to establish its survival. While in the host , some arboviruses replicate aggressively , resulting in host pathogenicity , and manifest as a disease condition. These viruses more often utilize the vectors as reservoirs before they are transmitted to the host and therefore do not amplify to as large titers as they do in the hosts. In spite of this , the vector undergoes stress and activates several of its defense systems , resulting in alterations in its physiology. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the physiological<symptom> changes<symptom> that the mosquito vector Aedes<pathogen> aegypti ( L.) ( Diptera: Culicidae) undergoes during the replication of an arbovirus , Chikungunya<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( CHIKV). After the mosquitoes were infected with CHIKV , dissemination of the virus into various tissues and physiological parameters such as fecundity , vector mortality , egg laying , survival rate , overall fitness were monitored throughout the lifespan of the mosquitoes. Our study reveals that there is a fitness cost to the mosquitoes due to the infection of CHIKV. This fitness cost is manifested as higher mortality and low survival rate of the CHIKV-infected mosquitoes. Further evaluation revealed that the egg-laying pathway was affected , resulting in lower number of eggs. Expression analysis of six transcripts in the egg-laying pathway revealed that these transcripts were downregulated during the gonotrophic cycles in CHIKV-infected mosquitoes as compared to normal blood-fed mosquitoes.
