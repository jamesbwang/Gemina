 Pigs are the most important reservoir for human pathogenic Yersinia<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen>. We investigated the herd prevalence of human pathogenic Y.<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen> in Swedish pig farms by analysing pen faecal samples using a cold enrichment of 1 week and thereafter subsequent plating onto chromogenic selective media ( CAY agar). Pathogenic Y.<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen> was found in 32 ( 30.5 %) of the 105 sampled farms with finisher pigs. Bioserotype 4/O: 3 was identified at all but one farm , where 2/O: 9 was identified. Pen-prevalence within the positive herds varied from 1/4 to 4/4 pens. The calculated intra-class correlation coefficient ICC ( 0.89) from a model with a random effect for grouping within herd indicated a very high degree of clustering by herd. None of the explored risk factors , including herd size , herd type , pig flow , feed type , access to outdoors , evidence of birds and rodents in the herd , usage of straw , number of pigs in sampled pen and age of pigs in pen were significantly associated with Y.<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen> status of the pen. The use of high pressure washing with cold water was significantly associated with Y.<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen> in the pen ( OR = 84.77 , 4.05-1772). Two culture methods were assessed for detection of Y.<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen> , one of which included the use of a chromogenic agar ( CAY agar) intended for detection of human pathogenic Y.<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen>. The chromogenic media was found equal or superior to traditional methods and was used in this study. The isolates obtained were characterised by biotyping , serotyping , mass spectrometry ( MALDI-TOF) and PCR. Characterisation by MALDI-TOF gave identical results to that of conventional bioserotyping. All porcine isolates were positive for the ail and inv genes by PCR , indicating that the isolates were most likely pathogenic to humans. Human pathogenic Y.<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen> was found in nearly one-third of the Swedish pig farms with finisher pigs. The use of high pressure washing with cold water was associated with the presence of Y.<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen> in the pen. A modified culturing method using a chromogenic agar was efficient for detection of pathogenic Y.<pathogen> enterocolitica<pathogen> in pig faeces. The use of masspectrometry for identification and subtyping was in agreement with conventional biotyping and serotyping methods.
