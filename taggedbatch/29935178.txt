 Honeybees , major providers of pollination , are endangered in many areas. Embryo cryopreservation may be a very useful tool to maintain their genetic diversity. However , it is complex in insects , because embryos are chill<symptom> sensitive and are surrounded by two protectant membranes<symptom> , the chorion and vitelline. These membranes<symptom> prevent penetration of cryoprotectant in the embryos. This study aimed to test different conditions of embryo preparation before cryopreservation , including low-frequency sonophoresis , a physical method of permeabilization , and passages through cryoprotectant solutions. Apis mellifera ligustica embryos were collected in artificial cell plugs 7.5 h after queens had been caged , in two different seasons ( winter , spring) and were then incubated in vitro overnight ( 16.5 h). Embryos were individually sonicated and then incubated in three cryoprotectant baths ( B1 = 10 % , B2 = 20 % and B3 = 40 % of cryoprotectant) and quenched in liquid nitrogen. Artificial cell plugs and in vitro incubation device were efficient in producing future embryos hatching. Embryos stained ruby red with rhodamine B after sonophoresis treatment indicated that low-frequency ultrasound had permeabilized embryos. According to the treatment , different significant hatching rates were obtained after sonophoresis ( up to 25 %). After three cryoprotectant incubations , best hatching rates were obtained after 10 min in B1 and B2 , and 40 s in B3. These results show that sonophoresis is an efficient tool to permeabilize the chorion and vitelline membrane of the day one honeybee embryo allowing a hatching rate of more than 20 %. They also show that the season is an important variability factor.
