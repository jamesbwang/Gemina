 The classificatory efforts that accompanied the modernization of the Habsburg state inadvertently helped establish , promote , and perpetuate national categories of identification , often contrary to the intentions of the Habsburg bureaucracy. The state did not create nations , but its classification of languages made available some ethnolinguistic identity categories that nationalists used to make political claims. The institutionalization of these categories also made them more relevant , especially as nationalist movements simultaneously worked toward the same goal. Yet identification with a nation did not follow an algorithmic logic , in the beginning of the twentieth century , sometimes earlier , various nationalisms could undoubtedly mobilize large numbers of people in Austria-Hungary , but people still had agency and nation-ness remained contingent and situational.
