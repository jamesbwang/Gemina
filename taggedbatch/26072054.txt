 This study aimed to test the association between the unstimulated whole salivary flow rate ( UWSFR) and the oral health status represented by dental and gingival status among healthy adult subjects. This work was a cross-sectional study of patients attending the undergraduate dental clinics at AlFarabi College for Dentistry and Nursing , Riyadh , Saudi Arabia. The study population consisted of 502 systemically healthy adults aged 18-35 years. UWSFR was collected for all study participants and expressed as ml/min. Oral health status was estimated using the Community Periodontal<disease> Index ( CPI) and the Oral Hygiene Index-Simplified ( OHI-S). The number of decayed teeth and the number of available teeth were also calculated to evaluate dental status. The mean UWSFR was 0.42 ( Â± 0.3) ml/min , and the male participants significantly had more UWSFR than the females. UWSFR was significantly affected by CPI , OHI-S , body mass index ( BMI) and gender as indicated in the univariate analysis. However , multiple regression analysis revealed that only gender was a significant predictor of UWSFR. The male subjects were shown to have a higher average of 0.133 ml/min than the females. High BMI scores , moderate-to-severe gingivitis<disease> and low level of oral hygiene increased UWSFR. However , further longitudinal studies are recommended to test the role of salivary cytokine levels to validate the exact association between the UWSFR and the oral health status.
