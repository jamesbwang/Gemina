 This study investigates the effect of anionic surfactant modification on activated carbon ( AC) to enhance the adsorption of ammonium ion in aqueous solution. Sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS) , sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate ( SDBS) or sodium octanoate ( SO) was used for the modification. At the initial aqueous concentration of 55 mg NH
