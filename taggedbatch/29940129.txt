 Protection of the ischemic and reperfused myocardium represents a major therapeutic challenge. Translating results from animal studies to the clinical setting has been disappointing , yet the need for effective intervention particularly to limit heart damage following infarction or surgical procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting is substantial. Among the many compounds touted as cardioprotective agents is ginseng , a medicinal herb belonging to the genus Panax which has been used as a medicinal agent for thousands of years , particularly in Asian societies. The biological actions of ginseng are very complex and reflect composition of many bioactive components although many of the biological and therapeutic effects of ginseng have been attributed to the presence of steroid-like saponins termed ginsenosides. Both ginseng as well as many ginsenosides have been shown to exert cardioprotective properties in experimental models. There is also clinical evidence that traditional Chinese medications containing ginseng exert cardioprotective properties although such clinical evidence is less robust primarily owing to the paucity of large scale clinical trials. Here , we discuss the experimental and clinical evidence for ginseng , ginsenosides and ginseng-containing formulations as cardioprotective agents against ischemic and reperfusion injury. We further discuss potential mechanisms , particularly as these relate to antioxidant properties.
