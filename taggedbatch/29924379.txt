 Nowadays , the majority of patients with myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation ( STEMI) are treated with primary percutaneous coronary interventions ( pPCI). In recent years , there have been ongoing improvements in PCI techniques , devices and concomitant pharmacotherapy. However , reports on further mortality reduction among PCI-treated STEMI patients remain inconclusive. The aim of this study was to compare changes in management and mortality in PCI-treated STEMI patients between 2005 and 2011 in a real-life setting. Data on 79,522 PCI-treated patients with STEMI from Polish Registry of Acute Coronary Syndromes<disease><symptom> ( PL-ACS) admitted to Polish hospitals between 2005 and 2011 were analyzed. First , temporal trends of in-hospital management in men and women were presented. In the next step , patients from 2005 and 2011 were nearest neighbor matched on their propensity scores to compare in-hospital , 30-day and 1-year mortality rates and in-hospital management strategies and complications. Some significant changes were noted in hospital management including shortening of median times from admission to PCI , increased use of drug-eluting stents , potent antiplatelet agents but also less frequent use of statin , beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. There was a strong tendency toward preforming additional PCI of non-infarct related arteries , especially in women. After propensity score adjustment there were significant changes in in-hospital but not in 30-day or 1-year mortality rates between 2005 and 2011 results were similar in men and women. There were apparent changes in management and significant in-hospital mortality reductions in PCI-treated STEMI patients between 2005 and 2011. However , it did not result in 30-day or 1-year survival benefit at a population level. There may be room for improvement in the use of guideline-recommended pharmacotherapy.
