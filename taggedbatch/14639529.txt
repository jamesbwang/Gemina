 Parkes-Weber syndrome<disease><symptom> is a congenital vascular disease that comprises capillary , venous , lymphatic , and arteriovenous malformations. Although Parkes-Weber syndrome<disease><symptom> is a clinically distinct entity with serious complications , it is still frequently misdiagnosed as Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome<disease><symptom> , which consists of a triad of malformations involving the capillary , venous , and lymphatic vessels , without arteriovenous fistulas<disease>. Both syndromes<disease><symptom> are generally diagnosed with Doppler ultrasound and confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography. The aim of this study is to describe one case of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome<disease><symptom> , in a 36-year-old patient , and one case of Parkes-Weber syndrome<disease><symptom> , in a 21-year-old patient. We review the literature in order to discuss the possible causes and consequences of these diseases related to venous hypertension and angiodysplasia , taking a clearer approach to their differences , and discussing their treatment.
