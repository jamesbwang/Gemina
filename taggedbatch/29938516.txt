 Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct ( IPNB) or biliary papillomatosis ( BP) is a premalignant entity with high risk of malignant transformation. When the disease extends widely from the intrahepatic to the extrahepatic biliary tree , liver transplantation ( LT) is the only option available. We present the case of a 43-year-old male who was admitted in our hospital with an acute cholangitis. He was diagnosed of diffuse biliary and pancreatic papillomatosis. Firstly , we performed a cephalic pancreaticoduodenectomy , then we completed a total pancreatectomy , and finally , after confirming the absence of foci of carcinoma infiltration or lymph nodes involvement , a LT was performed. Foci of carcinoma infiltration or lymph nodes involvement in the liver were not found. After a two-year follow-up the patient developed liver recurrence and the biopsy showed a biliary adenocarcinoma. In 2010 , Vibert et al. published a series of three cases concluding that in the absence of invasive carcinoma and positive lymph nodes , LT can be performed with success. The present case is the first to describe recurrence of the disease after LT in the absence of invasive carcinoma and positive lymph nodes in the literature. When the disease affects widely the entire biliary duct , small micro-invasive foci may not be detected. Nevertheless , although we know that it is a recurrent entity , the pathogenesis is unknown , and we do not know if it is possible that papillomatosis recurs over the new liver.
