 Bloodless pancreatic surgery ( BPS) is rarely performed and/or reported. We aim to characterize perioperative and anesthetic strategies in BPS. A literature search was performed on MEDLINE looking for case reports/case series using search terms ( `` Jehovah 's Witness '' ( All Fields)) AND ( `` Pancreatic Surgery '' ( All Fields) OR `` Pancreaticoduodenectomy '' ( All Fields) OR `` Distal Pancreatectomy '' ( All Fields)). Data regarding categorical variables are reported as proportions and quantitative continuous variables as medians with ranges or means with standard deviation. Forty-one patients requiring BPS are reported in the literature with three additional cases from our institution ( n = 44). The data analyzed included clinicopathologic factors , BPS strategies , patient complications , and in-hospital mortality. The most common procedure and diagnosis were pancreaticoduodenectomy ( n = 34 , 77.3 %) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( n = 12 , 27.3 %) , respectively. Transfusion reduction strategies in BPS fell into three categories: preoperative , intraoperative , and postoperative. Preoperative strategies included iron supplementation ( n = 24 , 54.5 %) and erythropoietin administration ( n = 14 , 41.2 %). Intraoperative strategies included acute normovolemic hemodilution ( n = 30 , 68 %) and cell saver ( n = 4 , 9.1 %). Postoperative strategies included erythropoietin ( n = 16 , 48.5 %) and iron supplementation ( n = 16 , 48.5 %). Complications occurred in 21 ( 60 %) patients. There was no in-hospital mortality among the 44 patients in this cohort. A broad spectrum of bloodless medicine and surgery practices were used based on patient selection , multidisciplinary practice , and preference. With careful perioperative and anesthetic management , BPS can be performed with good outcomes.
