 There is no consensus on the use of thrombus aspiration ( TA) in primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI) , and few studies have focused on the performance of tirofiban via TA catheter after PPCI. Our study investigated the clinical outcome of tirofiban injection through TA in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) patients with large thrombus burden undergoing PPCI treatment. The study comprised 122 STEMI patients who underwent TA during PPCI. Participants were randomly divided into two groups. Group A received intravenous tirofiban injection and tirofiban injection via a TA catheter to the infarcted coronary artery after aspiration ( n = 61). Group B received intravenous tirofiban injection only ( n = 61). Baseline clinical information and follow-up data were collected for both groups. Coronary angiography , electrocardiography , and echocardiography findings as well as major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE) were recorded. There were significant differences in postprocedural Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI) grade 2 and 3 flow between the two groups ( p = 0.021 , p = 0.006 , respectively). The incidence of slow-flow in group A was significantly lower than that of group B ( p = 0.011). An increased incidence of no ST-segment resolution was observed in group B ( p = 0.011). There were fewer major adverse cardiovascular events in group A than in group B , but the difference was not statistically significant. Selective tirofiban injection via TA catheter during PPCI may improve myocardial reperfusion in STEMI patients with large thrombus burden.
