 Despite having considerable influence over resource allocation clinicians possess poor knowledge of healthcare costs. This study evaluated surgeons ' cost-awareness with regard to surgical equipment and assessed attitudes towards health economics training using survey format. An online survey was distributed to 326 surgeons across a range of specialties in Ireland. Respondents were asked about their surgical expertise , previous training in health economics , and its role in the surgical curriculum. They were also asked to estimate the recommended retail price ( RRP) of 17 commonly used items of surgical equipment. Answers within ± 25 % of the RRP were considered correct. Of 140 respondents , 62 ( 44.3 %) were on a surgical training scheme and 16 ( 11.4 %) were consultants. Overall , surgeons correctly estimated the RRP of only 14.0 % of items. There was no difference in accuracy between surgeons in later years of training compared to their junior counterparts ( 13.1 ± 8.8 % versus 15.0 ± 8.8 % , p = 0.115). The highest individual score was six out of 17 items correctly estimated. Participants overestimated the cost of low-cost items by 347.7 % and underestimated the cost of high-cost items by 35.5 %. Only 5.7 % of participants had received undergraduate training in health economics but 75.0 % felt it should be included in the curriculum. Over two-thirds said their practice would change if they had better knowledge of the cost of surgical equipment. The majority of surgeons receive little training in health economics and have poor knowledge of the cost of surgical equipment. Most would welcome more training at both an undergraduate and postgraduate level. An opportunity exists to promote cost awareness in the operating room , which could lead to a reduction in waste and improved use of resources.
