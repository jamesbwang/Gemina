 We report methods to generate three-dimensional maps of birefringence , its position and orientation in juvenile shells of the Atlantic hard clamshell ( Mercenaria mercenaria). For measuring the retardance and optic axis orientation of curved shell surfaces in three dimensions , we developed enhanced acquisition and processing algorithms and combined results from conventional and light field imaging approaches to reconstruct the three-dimensional shell shape and its anisotropic optical properties. Our work represents the first successful attempt to generate such maps at a spatial resolution of about 2 μm and angular steps of about 9 ° in terms of the inclination angles of the optic axis. The maps of clamshell birefringence provide structural insights into the early mineralization during juvenile clamshell development.
