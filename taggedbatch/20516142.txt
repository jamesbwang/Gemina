 This study aimed to explore predictors of long-term stabilization of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy ( PCV) lesions<symptom> and vision in response to injection of intravitreal ranibizumab ( IVR). The treated eyes had a baseline best corrected visual acuity ( BCVA) of at least 0.6 ( logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution ( logMAR) 0.22). We treated 45 eyes showing BCVA between 0.6 ( logMAR 0.22) and 1.0 ( logMAR 0) , with IVR for 3 consecutive months. All eyes were confirmed to have subfoveal PCV prior to starting this treatment regimen. Additional IVR was administered at the subsequent monthly visits , if necessitated by evidence of persistent PCV , for up to 23 months after the first ranibizumab injection. The subjects were then carefully followed-up for 24 months , allowing detailed retrospective evaluation of changes in mean BCVA , central retinal thickness ( CRT) , serous retinal detachment ( SRD) , hemorrhage<symptom> , and polypoidal lesion<symptom> numbers. The relationships between retreatment and each of the baseline characteristics and SRD development during follow-up were analyzed.The mean logMAR BCVAs were 0.111 ± 0.076 , 0.068 ± 0.206 ( P = .0033) and 0.115 ± 0.265 ( P = .27) at baseline and at 12 and 24 months , respectively. At 24 months , 87 % of eyes had BCVA of 20/40 or better. Not requiring retreatment between 12 and 23 months was found to be significantly associated with the absence of retinal pigment epithelial detachment ( RPED) at baseline ( odds ratio: 0.262 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.073-0.946). The rates of retreatment from 12 to 23 months were significantly higher in eyes with SRD at 6 and 12 months than in those without SRD ( P = .004 and P < .001). In conclusion , during 24 months of antivascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) therapy using ranibizumab for PCV , BCVA was maintained in those with good visual acuity at baseline. Comprehensive analyses revealed RPED at baseline and SRD development during follow-up to correlate significantly with the need for retreatment between 12 and 23 months. Our observations might facilitate tailoring treatments to individual PCV patients.
