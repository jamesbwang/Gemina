 Because mild Traumatic Brain Injuries ( mTBI) are heterogeneous , classification methods perform outlier detection from a model of healthy tissue. Such a model is challenging to construct. Instead , we utilize region-specific pairwise ( person-to-person) comparisons. Each person-region is characterized by a distribution of Fractional Anisotropy and comparisons are made via Median , Mean , Bhattacharya and Kullback-Liebler distances. Additionally , we examine an ordinal decision rule which compares a subject 's n
