 Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) pathogenesis is a multifactorial process that involves numerous pathways within the central nervous system. Thus , interventions that interact with several disease-related pathways may offer an increased opportunity for successful prevention and treatment of AD. Translocator protein 18 kD ( TSPO) is a mitochondrial protein that is associated with regulation of many cellular processes including inflammation<symptom> , steroid synthesis , apoptosis , and mitochondrial respiration<symptom>. Although TSPO ligands have been shown to be protective in several neurodegenerative paradigms , little work has been done to assess their potential as treatments for AD. Female 3xTg-AD mice were administered the TSPO ligand PK11195 once weekly for 5 weeks beginning at 16 months , an age characterized by extensive β-amyloid pathology and behavioral impairments. Animals treated with PK11195 showed improvements in behavior and modest reductions of in both soluble and deposited β-amyloid. The finding that short-term PK11195 treatment was effective in improving both behavioral and pathological outcomes in a model of late-stage AD supports further investigation of TSPO ligands as potential therapeutics for the treatment of AD.
