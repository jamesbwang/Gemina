 Zwitterionic nanocarriers have emerged as a new class of biocompatible nanomaterials with outstanding stealth capability in blood circulation. In this work , a novel biodegradable zwitterionic nanogel based on poly ( sulfobetaine methacrylate) ( PSBMA) was developed for reduction-responsive drug delivery to tumors. PSBMA nanogels were facilely fabricated by one-step reflux precipitation polymerization with the advantage of being surfactant-free and time-saving. The disulfide bond not only endowed the nanogels degradability in a reduction environment but also be modified with a fluorescent group after partial reduction. In vitro release experiments disclosed that doxorubicin ( DOX)- loaded PSBMA nanogels could hold the drugs firmly in physiological conditions ( only 7 % release in 24 h) and release the drugs rapidly and sufficiently in 10 mM glutathione ( 85 % in 8 h). More interestingly , PSBMA nanogels displayed long circulation in blood after intravenous injection , and small change was found in half-life of nanogels between the first ( 34.1 h) and the second injection ( 30.5 h) , indicating that there was no accelerated blood clearance phenomenon for these nanogels. Meanwhile , no obvious immunogenic response was detected after PSBMA nanogels were injected into BALB/c mice. Furthermore , PSBMA nanogels showed a high accumulation of 9.5 and 10.7 % of injected dose per gram of tissue in tumors at 24 and 48 h post intravenous injection , respectively. With outstanding long circulation time , high tumor accumulation , and sufficient drug release in a reduction environment , DOX-loaded PSBMA nanogels demonstrated the strongest tumor growth inhibition effect among all of the treatment groups in human hypopharyngeal carcinoma-bearing mouse models. Therefore , our study provided a facile drug delivery platform based on biodegradable zwitterionic nanogels and may have great potential in tumor drug delivery.
