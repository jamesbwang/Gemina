 The optimal choice of conduit and configuration for coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG) in diabetic patients remains somewhat controversial , even though arterial grafts have been proposed as superior. We attempted to clarify the role of complete arterial revascularization using the left internal thoracic artery ( LITA) and the radial artery ( RA) alone in `` T-Graft '' configuration on long-term outcome. From 1994 to 2001 , 104 diabetic patients with triple vessel disease underwent CABG using LITA/RA `` T-Grafts '' ( Group-A). Using propensity-score matching , 104 patients with comparable preoperative characteristics who underwent CABG using LITA and one sequential vein graft were identified ( Group-V). Freedom from all causes of death , cardiac death , major adverse cardiac event ( MACE) , major adverse cardiac ( and cerebral) event ( MACCE) , and repeat revascularization at 10 years of Group-A was 60 ± 5 % , 67 ± 5 % , 48 ± 5 % , 37 ± 5 % , and 81 ± 4 % , respectively , compared with 58 ± 5 % , 70 ± 5 % , 49 ± 5 % , 39 ± 5 % , and 93 ± 3 % in Group-V. There were no significant differences in these end points between groups regardless of insulin-dependency. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model identified age , left ventricular ejection fraction , renal<symptom> failure<symptom> , and hyperlipidemia as independent predictors for all death , age and left ventricular ejection fraction for cardiac death , sinus rhythm for both MACE and MACCE , and prior percutaneous coronary intervention for re-revascularization. In our experience , complete arterial revascularization using LITA/RA `` T-Grafts '' does not provide superior long-term clinical benefits for diabetic patients compared with a combination of LITA and sequential vein graft.
