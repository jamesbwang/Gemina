 Investigate the influence of benazepril and amlodipine on the expression of secretin ( PZ) and somatostatin ( SS) in spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR). Forty-five SHRs ( 14 weeks old , male) were randomly assigned into 3 groups ( After 8 weeks of intervention , compared with the WKY group , the expression of protein and mRNA of PZ in duodenum and SS in sinuses ventriculi was increased significantly in SHR group ( The regulation disorder of PZ in duodenum and SS in sinuses ventriculi exists in SHR. The antihypertensive effect of benazepril and amlodipine may be realized by regulating the expression of PZ and SS , while the regulation of amlodipine is more obvious than benazepril.
