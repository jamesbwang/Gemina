 Endosulfan is a persistent insecticide that is still used in some countries even though it is life-threatening and banned in the agricultural struggle. The solubility of pesticides in water is negligible. It is known that pesticides with better solubility in organic solvents have different solubility when the dielectric constants of these solvents are taken into account. The polymeric structure of arginine was modified with methacrylate to be a functional monomer , and it was immobilized on a solid support , poly ( HEMA) , and finally , poly ( 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-arginine methacrylate) was obtained and used as an effective adsorbent. The effect of organic solvents on endosulfan adsorption was investigated for the first time in the literature. Endosulfan was removed from alcohol media by using this polymeric structure synthesized by exploiting alcoho-phobic interaction in this work. Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR) , elemental analysis , and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR) methods were used for the structural characterization and therefore to prove successful synthesis of cryogels. Morphological characteristics were also investigated by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , an N
