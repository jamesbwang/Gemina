 Pneumonia<disease> is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Since 2014 , the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service ( HIRA) has assessed the overall quality of care among hospitalized adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia<disease> ( CAP) provided by all medical institutions in Korea. A committee of the Korea Academy of Tuberculosis and Respiratory<disease> Diseases developed the hospital inpatient quality measures set for CAP consisting of eight core measures and five monitoring measures. The composite measure score was calculated. The medical records of hospitalized adult patients ages 18 years or more with CAP from October to December 2014 were evaluated. The data of 523 hospitals ( 42 tertiary hospitals ( 8.0 %) , 256 general hospitals ( 49 %) , and 225 hospitals ( 43.0 %)) and 15,432 cases ( tertiary hospitals , 1,673 cases ( 10.8 %); general hospitals , 8,803 cases ( 57.1 %); hospitals , 4,956 cases ( 32.1 %)) were analyzed. We found large variations among institutions in terms of performance of care measures for CAP. For the composite measure score , the mean value was 66.7 ( tertiary hospitals , 98.5; general hospitals , 79.2; hospitals , 43.8). Despite significant differences in measure scores between tertiary , general hospitals and hospitals , no significant differences were found in mortality between hospitals. Further studies are needed to determine the care measures appropriate for CAP.
