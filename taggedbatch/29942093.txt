 Intratumoral stimulatory dendritic cells ( SDCs) play an important role in stimulating cytotoxic T cells and driving immune responses against cancer. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate their abundance in the tumor microenvironment ( TME) could unveil new therapeutic opportunities. We find that in human melanoma , SDC abundance is associated with intratumoral expression of the gene encoding the cytokine FLT3LG. FLT3LG is predominantly produced by lymphocytes , notably natural killer ( NK) cells in mouse and human tumors. NK cells stably form conjugates with SDCs in the mouse TME , and genetic and cellular ablation of NK cells in mice demonstrates their importance in positively regulating SDC abundance in tumor through production of FLT3L. Although anti-PD-1 ` checkpoint ' immunotherapy for cancer largely targets T cells , we find that NK cell frequency correlates with protective SDCs in human cancers , with patient responsiveness to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy , and with increased overall survival. Our studies reveal that innate immune SDCs and NK cells cluster together as an excellent prognostic tool for T cell-directed immunotherapy and that these innate cells are necessary for enhanced T cell tumor responses , suggesting this axis as a target for new therapies.
