 Harmful algal blooms ( HABs) induced by Prorocentrum donghaiense occur frequently and cause a serious threat to the marine ecosystem. In this study , antialgal effects of Î±-linolenic acid ( ALA) that is generally extracted from diverse macroalga on P. donghaiense were investigated. Specifically , the growth , cellular morphology and ultrastructure , reactive oxygen species ( ROS) content , mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP) , cytochrome C ( Cyt-C) , and caspase-9,3 activity of untreated and treated P. donghaiense were investigated. The results showed that ALA significantly inhibited the growth of P. donghaiense. Under ALA exposure , the cellular morphology and ultrastructure were damaged. ALA also induced ROS overproduction in the algal cells , decreased MMP , induced Cyt-C release , and activated caspase-9,3 , which strongly relates to algal apoptosis. In summary , this study revealed the responses of morphology and physiology of P. donghaiense when exposed under ALA , and shows the potential of biotechnology on controlling P. donghaiense.
