 Few studies have examined the relationship between cognition and function for acute stroke inpatients utilizing comprehensive methods. This study aimed to assess the relationship of a neuropsychological model , above and beyond a baseline model , with concurrent functional status across multiple domains in the early weeks of stroke recovery and rehabilitation. Seventy-four acute stroke patients were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Functional domains of ability , adjustment , and participation were assessed using the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory- 4 ( MPAI-4). Hierarchical linear regression was used to assess a neuropsychological model comprised of cognitive tests scores on domains of executive function , memory , and visuospatial-constructional skills ( VSC) , after accounting for a baseline model comprised of common demographic and stroke variants used to predict outcome. The neuropsychological model was significantly associated , above and beyond the baseline model , with MPAI-4 Ability , Participation , and Total scores ( all p-values < .05). The strength of association varied across functional domains. Analyzing tests of executive function , the Color Trails Test-Part 2 predicted MPAI-4 Participation ( β = -.46 , p = .001) , and Total score ( β = -.32 , p = .02). Neuropsychological assessment contributes independently to the determination of multiple domains of functional function , above and beyond common medical variants of stroke , in the early weeks of recovery and rehabilitation. Multiple tests of executive function are recommended to develop a greater appreciation of a patient 's concurrent functional abilities.
