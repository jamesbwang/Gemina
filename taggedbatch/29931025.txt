 Carbon nanodots ( Cdots) are now emerging as promising nonlinear fluorophores for applications in biological environments. A thorough and systematic approach to the two-photon induced emission of Cdots that could provide design guidelines to control their nonlinear emission properties is still missing. In this work , we address the nonlinear optical spectroscopy of Cdots prepared by controlled chemical cutting of graphene oxide ( GO). The two-photon absorption in the 700-1000 nm region and the corresponding emission spectrum are carefully investigated. The highest two-photon absorption cross-section estimated was 130 GM at 720 nm. This value is comparable with the one reported for graphene nanoribbons with push-pull architecture. The emission spectrum depends on the excitation mode. At the same excitation energy , nonlinear excitation results in excitation-wavelength independent emission , while upon linear excitation the emission is excitation-wavelength dependent. The biphotonic interaction seems to be selective towards sp2 clusters bearing electron donor and acceptor groups found in push-pull architectures. Both linear and nonlinear emission can be understood based on the existence of isolated sp2 clusters involved in π-π stacking interactions with clusters in adjacent layers.
