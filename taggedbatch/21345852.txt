 Atrial septal defect ( ASD) is a common congenital abnormality , which accounts for 20-40 % of all the adult patients with congenital heart diseases. Due to the slow velocity of shunt flow , ASD has a negligible risk for infective endocarditis<disease> ( IE). However , intravenous drug abuse ( IVDA) is a potential cause for IE. IE remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Our case report demonstrates the atypical presentation of IE in an ASD patient. The diagnosis was made on the basis of modified Duke criteria , and blood cultures were found out to be positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA). The treatment for IE was completed in six weeks with full recovery , and the patient underwent a surgery for ASD closure. This case highlights that IE should not be overlooked in ASD patients and that a high index of suspicion , in addition to proper antibiotic therapy , is lifesaving. Also , follow-up , along with rehabilitation measures , should be taken for patients with a history of drug abuse in order to prevent the risk of reinfection.
