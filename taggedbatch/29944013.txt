 The aim of the meta-analysis was to evaluate the association between 10 widely studied polymorphisms of interleukin-23 receptor gene ( IL-23R) and ankylosing spondylitis ( AS). A comprehensive literature search , screening of eligible articles and data extraction was performed independently by two investigators. Further meta-analysis was conducted with STATA 12.0 software ( Stata Corp.; College Station , TX , USA). The association between IL-23R polymorphisms and AS was evaluated by odds ratio ( OR) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI). Twenty-five case-control studies with 8431 cases and 8972 controls were included in this meta-analysis. Quantitative meta-analysis revealed that minor allele frequency ( MAF) of rs1004819 , rs1495965 , and rs2201841 was significantly higher in the AS group ( p value < .001 , < .001 , = .010 , respectively). MAF of rs10489629 , rs11209026 , rs11465804 , and rs1343151was significantly lower in the AS group ( p value = .002 , < .001 , = .032 , < .001 , respectively). However , there is no significant difference between these two groups in rs10889677 , rs11209032 , and rs7517847 frequency ( p value = .128 , .237 , .131 , respectively). The present study indicates that minor allele carriers of rs1004819 , rs1495965 , and rs2201841 are susceptible to AS. Conversely , minor alleles of rs10489629 , rs11209026 , rs11465804 , and rs1343151 have protective effect on AS.
