 The transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion ( TLIF) is a well-established 3-column fusion technique that can be used to manage lumbar stenosis , instability , and deformity. Having been in use for more than 20 years , it has evolved into many different renditions. This includes protocols using minimally invasive surgery ( MIS) approaches. To avoid the development of flatback syndrome<disease><symptom> , it is important that a TLIF procedural technique is capable of reproducibly restoring lordosis. This article describes one of many MIS TLIF protocols and presents some of its previously published outcomes.
