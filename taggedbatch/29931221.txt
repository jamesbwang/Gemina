 Numerous high-throughput omics studies have been conducted in schizophrenia , providing an accumulated catalog of susceptible variants and genes. The results from these studies , however , are highly heterogeneous. The variants and genes nominated by different omics studies often have limited overlap with each other. There is thus a pressing need for integrative analysis to unify the different types of data and provide a convergent view of schizophrenia candidate genes ( SZgenes). In this study , we collected a comprehensive , multidimensional dataset , including 7819 brain-expressed genes. The data hosted genome-wide association evidence in genetics ( eg , genotyping data , copy number variations , de novo mutations) , epigenetics , transcriptomics , and literature mining. We developed a method named mega-analysis of odds ratio ( MegaOR) to prioritize SZgenes. Application of MegaOR in the multidimensional data resulted in consensus sets of SZgenes ( up to 530) , each enriched with dense , multidimensional evidence. We proved that these SZgenes had highly tissue-specific expression in brain and nerve and had intensive interactions that were significantly stronger than chance expectation. Furthermore , we found these SZgenes were involved in human brain development by showing strong spatiotemporal expression patterns; these characteristics were replicated in independent brain expression datasets. Finally , we found the SZgenes were enriched in critical functional gene sets involved in neuronal activities , ligand gated ion signaling , and fragile X mental retardation protein targets. In summary , MegaOR analysis reported consensus sets of SZgenes with enriched association evidence to schizophrenia , providing insights into the pathophysiology underlying schizophrenia.
