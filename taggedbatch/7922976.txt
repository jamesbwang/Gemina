 Mediastinal leiomyosarcoma is very rare. In this paper , we report one case of anterior mediastinal leiomyosarcoma and retrospectively review the imaging findings of previously reported cases. A 61-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital due to the presence of a mediastinal space-occupying lesion<symptom> for two years. Two years previously , chest computed tomography ( CT) showed a small nodule<disease> in the anterior mediastinum. Twenty days previously , the CT examination was repeated at the local hospital due to respiratory<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , which showed a mass in the anterior mediastinum and interstitial inflammation<symptom> of both lungs. After admission to our hospital , chest contrast-enhanced CT scanning showed a mass in the right anterior mediastinum that was approximately 3.3 Ã— 5.2 cm2 in size that had a clear boundary , slightly heterogeneous internal density and heterogeneous enhancement. The patient underwent a mediastinal lump resection. Finally , the pathological diagnosis was anterior mediastinal leiomyosarcoma. The patient recovered well after the operation. Accidental discovery of anterior mediastinal nodules<symptom> should be followed up. Mediastinal leiomyosarcoma is common in the posterior mediastinum. Imaging shows a heterogeneous mass with a space-occupying effect that may easily involve adjacent mediastinal vessels or infiltrate surrounding organs.
