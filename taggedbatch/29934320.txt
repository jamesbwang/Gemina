 NAD ( P) H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 ( NQO1) protects cells against oxidative stress and toxic quinones. In this study , we found a novel role of NQO1 in suppressing Toll-like receptor ( TLR)- mediated innate immune responses. NQO1-deficient macrophages selectively produced excessive amounts of IL-6 , IL-12 , and GM-CSF on LPS stimulation , and the deletion of NQO1 in macrophages exacerbated LPS-induced septic shock<symptom>. NQO1 interacted with the nuclear IκB protein IκB-ζ , which is essential for the TLR-mediated induction of a subset of secondary response genes , including IL-6 , and promoted IκB-ζ degradation in a ubiquitin-dependent manner. We demonstrated that PDLIM2 , known as the ubiquitin E3 ligase , participates in NQO1-dependent IκB-ζ degradation. NQO1 augmented the association between PDLIM2 and IκB-ζ , resulting in increased IκB-ζ degradation. Collectively , this study describes a mechanism of the NQO1-PDLIM2 complex as a novel and important regulator in the innate immune signaling and suggests the therapeutic potential of NQO1 in TLR-mediated inflammation<symptom> and disorders.
