 To study the bone mineral content and density in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia<disease>. 35 children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia<disease> and 35 healthy controls were enrolled. Bone mineral content and density were studied by Dual Energy X-ray absorptiometry. The mean ( SD) of lumbar spine bone mineral density ( g/cm2) in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia<disease> was 0.590 ( 0.100) , and in controls it was 0.589 ( 0.088) ( P = 0.97). The mean ( SD) of Total Body less head bone mineral density ( g/cm2) in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia<disease> was 0.536 ( 0.090) , and in controls it was 0.548 ( 0.111) ( P = 0.64). The mean ( SD) of lumbar spine bone mineral content ( g) in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia<disease> was 29.85 ( 27.63) , and in controls it was 31.03 ( 29.19) ( P = 0.86). The mean ( SD) of Total Body less head bone mineral content ( g) in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia<disease> was 254.27 ( 281.25) , and in controls it was 273.07 ( 330.71) ( P = 0.79). Bone mineral density and content in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia<disease> are maintained in the normal range.
