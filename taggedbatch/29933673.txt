 In this work , two algorithms ( overlapping method and the probability-based method) for design space calculation were compared by using the data collected from extraction process of Codonopsis Radix as an example. In the probability-based method , experimental error was simulated to calculate the probability of reaching the standard. The effects of several parameters on the calculated design space were studied , including simulation number , step length , and the acceptable probability threshold. For the extraction process of Codonopsis Radix , 10 000 times of simulation and 0.02 for the calculation step length can lead to a satisfactory design space. In general , the overlapping method is easy to understand , and can be realized by several kinds of commercial software without coding programs , but the reliability of the process evaluation indexes when operating in the design space is not indicated. Probability-based method is complex in calculation , but can provide the reliability to ensure that the process indexes can reach the standard within the acceptable probability threshold. In addition , there is no probability mutation in the edge of design space by probability-based method. Therefore , probability-based method is recommended for design space calculation.
