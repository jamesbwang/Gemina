 Collecting duct carcinoma ( CDC) is a rare type of renal cancer with a poor prognosis. As there are no standard guidelines for the management of metastatic CDC ( mCDC) , we evaluated the efficacy and safety of combined therapies of sorafenib , gemcitabine , plus cisplatin in patients with mCDC. A prospective , multicentre , single-arm , open-label , phase 2 trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01762150) that enrolled 26 mCDC patients with no prior systemic chemotherapy. Patients were treated with sorafenib ( 400 mg orally , twice daily) combined with chemotherapy ( gemcitabine 1000 mg/m The 6-month PFS rate was 65 % , and the median PFS was 8.8 months ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 6.7-10.9) with a median overall survival of about 12.5 months ( 95 % CI: 9.6-15.4). The objective response rate was 30.8 % , and the disease control rate was 84.6 %. The treatment was generally well tolerated. Major grade 3/4 toxicities included leucopenia ( 26.9 %) , thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( 23.1 %) , anaemia ( 11.5 %) and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia ( 7.7 %). Though the combination of sorafenib and chemotherapy demonstrated a similar outcome as that of the previously reported regimens in patients with mCDC , this combination may be a suitable option for patients who have low Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status or less metastatic sites.
