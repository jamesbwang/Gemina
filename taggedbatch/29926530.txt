 In order to obtain optical control of GPCR function , we set out to develop small-molecule ligands with photoswitchable efficacy in which both configurations bind the target protein but exert distinct pharmacological effects , i.e. , stimulate or antagonise GPCR activation. Our design was based on a previously identified efficacy hotspot for the peptidergic chemokine receptor CXCR3 and resulted in the synthesis and characterization of five new azobenzene-containing CXCR3 ligands. G protein activation assay and real-time electrophysiology experiments demonstrated a photoswitching from antagonism to partial agonism and even to full agonism ( VUF16216). SAR evaluation suggests that the size and electron-donating properties of the inner aromatic ring substituents are important for the efficacy photoswitching. These azo compounds are the first GPCR ligands with a nearly full efficacy photoswitch and may become valuable pharmacological tools for the optical control of peptidergic GPCR signaling.
