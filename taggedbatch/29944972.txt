 In the female genital<disease> tract , extra-uterine leiomyomas such as those that arise in the ovary and paraovarian/paratubal regions are rare. Currently , little is known about the background genetic changes in such adnexal leiomyomas. Recent studies have found that the MED12 mutation is common in uterine leiomyomas , which suggests that such mutations may play an oncogenic role in smooth muscle neoplasms in females. Herein , we examined a series of ovarian and other adnexal leiomyomas in terms of MED12 mutational status to investigate possible MED12 involvement in the pathogenesis of extra-uterine smooth muscle tumors. We evaluated 10 cases of adnexal leiomyomas ( five ovarian , three paraovarian , and two paratubal) , and 49 cases of ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors as controls. We performed polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing of exon 2 of MED12 , and immunohistochemical staining for smooth muscle actin ( SMA) and desmin. We identified somatic MED12 mutations in 90 % ( 9/10) of the adnexal leiomyomas. None of the sex cord-stromal tumors in the control group harbored MED12 mutations. Diffuse immunoreactivity for both SMA and desmin were characteristic of adnexal leiomyomas only. Thus , we conclude that ovarian leiomyomas are distinct from sex cord-stromal tumors. MED12 mutations are key molecular features of ovarian and other adnexal leiomyomas. We speculate that the pathogenesis of adnexal leiomyoma is similar to that of its uterine counterpart.
