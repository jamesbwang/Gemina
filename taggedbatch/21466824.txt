 Intracranial administration of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) is known to elicit a rapid innate immune response , activate glial cells in the brain , and induce depression-like behavior. However , no study has focused on the changes in glial cells induced by intraperitoneal injection of LPS in vivo. Ten adult male Fischer F344 rats underwent ( There was a cluster of brain regions that showed significant reductions in SUV. This cluster included the bilateral striata and bilateral frontal regions , especially the somatosensory areas. Changes in activity of glial cells induced by the intraperitoneal injection of LPS were detected in vivo by (
