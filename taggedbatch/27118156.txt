 In our previous work , we proposed a genomic prediction method combing identical-by-state-based Haseman-Elston regression and best linear prediction with additive variance component only ( HEBLP | A herein) , the most essential component of genetic variation. Since the dominance effects contribute significantly in heterosis , it is desirable to incorporate the HEBLP with dominance variance component that is expected to enhance the predictive accuracy as we move to the further development: HEBLP | AD , a paralleled implementation of genomic prediction compared with genomic best linear unbiased prediction ( GBLUP). The simulation results indicated that when the dominance effects contributed to a large proportion of genetic variation , HEBLP | AD and GBLUP | AD , having similar accuracy , both outperformed HEBLP | A; but when the dominance variation was none or little , HEBLP | A , HEBLP | AD , and GBLUP | AD had similar predictability. The analysis of real data from Arabidopsis thaliana F2 population also demonstrated the latter situation. In summary , HEBLP | AD performed stable whether a trait was controlled by dominance effects or not.
