 Assemblages of self-propelled particles , often termed active matter , exhibit collective behavior due to competition between neighbor alignment and noise-induced decoherence. However , very little is known of how the quenched ( i.e. , time-independent) disorder impacts active motion. Here we report on the effects of quenched disorder on the dynamics of self-propelled point particles. We identified three major types of quenched disorder relevant in the context of active matter: random torque , force , and stress. We demonstrate that even in the absence of external fluctuations ( `` cold active matter '') , quenched disorder results in nontrivial dynamic phases not present in their `` hot '' counterpart. In particular , by analyzing when the equations of motion exhibit a Hamiltonian structure and when attractors may be present , we identify in which scenarios particle trapping , i.e. , the asymptotic convergence of particle trajectories to bounded areas in space ( `` traps '') , can and can not occur. Our study provides new fundamental insights into active systems realized by self-propelled particles on natural and synthetic disordered substrates.
