 Constitutive NF-κB signaling represents a hallmark of chronic inflammation<symptom> and autoimmune diseases. The E3 ligase TNF receptor-associated factor 6 ( TRAF6) acts as a key regulator bridging innate immunity , pro-inflammatory cytokines , and antigen receptors to the canonical NF-κB pathway. Structural analysis and point mutations have unraveled the essential role of TRAF6 binding to the E2 conjugating enzyme Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N ( Ubc13 or UBE2N) to generate Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains for inflammatory and immune signal propagation. Genetic mutations disrupting TRAF6-Ubc13 binding have been shown to reduce TRAF6 activity and consequently , NF-κB activation. However , to date no small molecule modulator is available to inhibit the TRAF6-Ubc13 interaction and thereby counteract NF-κB signaling and associated diseases. Here , using a high-throughput small-molecule screening approach , we discovered an inhibitor of the TRAF6-Ubc13 interaction that reduces TRAF6-Ubc13 activity both in vitro and in cells. We found that this compound , C25-140 , impedes NF-κB activation in various immune and inflammatory signaling pathways also in primary human and murine cells. Importantly , C25-140 ameliorated inflammation<symptom> and improved disease outcomes of autoimmune psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> in preclinical in vivo mouse models. Hence , the first-in-class TRAF6-Ubc13 inhibitor C25-140 expands the toolbox for studying the impact of the ubiquitin system on immune signaling and underscores the importance of TRAF6 E3 ligase activity in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom>. We propose that inhibition of TRAF6 activity by small molecules represents a promising novel strategy for targeting autoimmune and chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>.
