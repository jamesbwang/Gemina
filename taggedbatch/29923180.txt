 While enhanced platelet activation may drive cancer progression and metastases , less is known about its role in early cancer development. Thus , we evaluated whether pre-diagnostic biomarkers of platelet activation and coagulation are related to the risks of common cancers in the prospective EPIC-Heidelberg Study using a case-cohort design. Levels of fibrinogen , soluble glycoprotein ( sGP) IIb/IIIa , soluble P-selectin ( sP-selectin) , soluble thrombomodulin ( sTM) , and thrombopoietin ( TPO) were measured in baseline plasma samples of a random subcohort ( n = 2,480) and incident cases of breast ( n = 605) , prostate ( n = 543) , and colorectal cancer ( n = 249). Multivariable Cox regression models revealed no statistically significant associations between biomarker concentrations and any of the cancer endpoints. Subgroup analyses showed a significant inverse relationship between TPO and colorectal cancer among men , with a hazard ratio ( HR , highest vs. lowest quartile) of 0.60 ( 95 % confidence interval: 0.37,0.95) , whereas no significant association was observed among women. With regard to fibrinogen levels and breast cancer risk , there was a significant positive association among nulliparous women ( HR: 2.53 ( 95 % CI: 1.21 , 5.30)) , but not among parous women. Overall , our data suggest that enhanced platelet activation and a pro-coagulative state may not be related to increased risks of common cancers , although studies on other potential biomarkers of platelet activation and further cancer types are needed. Findings from our subgroup analyses require further investigation , as potential underlying mechanisms are not known. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
