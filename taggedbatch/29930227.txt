 Changes in cerebral hemodynamics have been reported in schizophrenia and proposed as underlying the cognitive deficits seen in patients. The objective of our study was to compare changes of the cerebral blood flow velocity ( BFV) during neurocognitive tasks between the patients with the first episode of psychosis and healthy controls. We recruited 46 patients with the first episode of psychosis ( FEP) , admitted to the University Hospital Centre Zagreb during 2016-2017 and 41 control subjects. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography monitoring of BFV in both middle cerebral arteries was recorded during 25-minute long neurocognitive assessment with Phonemic Verbal Fluency test , Trial Making Test B and Stroop test. Between every consecutive test resting periods were recorded. After the adjustment for age , sex and education by quantile regression , patients with FEP had significantly lower BFV in middle cerebral arteries during the 3 Decreased middle BFV during the execution of particular neurocognitive tasks in patients with FEP , compared to control subjects might indicate impaired hemodynamic function in the prefrontal/parietal brain areas , and possibly provide an explanation of some of the observed neurocognitive deficits in patients with the first episode of psychosis.
