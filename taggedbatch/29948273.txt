 To evaluate tooth development and calculate dental maturity score in prematurely born children and to compare the findings with full-term born children. Nine-year-old preterm children were selected from the Swedish Medical Birth Register. One group consisted of 36 extremely preterm children ( born before week 29) , and the other included 38 very preterm children ( born during weeks 29 to 32). Panoramic radiography was performed on each child and the preterm children were compared with 42 full-term born children. Five observers independently assessed the tooth development stages for all teeth in the left mandible ( 31-37) on the panoramic radiographs according to the method described by Demirjian et al. ( Hum Biol 45:211-227 , 1973). Data from tooth development stages were compiled and converted into a dental maturity score for each group. Kappa values were calculated for intra- and inter-observer agreement. When the different development stages for each individual tooth were compared , all observers presented a significant delay in the maturity of tooth 37 for the extremely preterm group ( p ≤ 0.002). The extremely preterm group had a significantly lower dental maturity score than the full-term group , as assessed by each observer ( p ≤ 0.006). Kappa values for inter-observer agreement varied between 0.31 and 0.71 depending on tooth and intra-observer agreement was between 0.16 and 1.0. At age 9 , the extremely preterm children had a general delay in tooth development. The increased survival rate of extremely preterm babies adds a new group of children to society. Dental clinicians should be aware that the delay in tooth development could impact the timing of orthodontic diagnostics and potential treatment.
