 The decreased bone mineral density and compromised bone strength predispose individuals to skeletal osteoporosis. Both prostate cancer and bone metastasis caused by cancer invasion have remained a great challenge to researchers. With the advancement in the fields of biochemistry and biomechanics , the molecular mechanisms that make prostate cancer metastasize to bone have recently been identified , and they provide new molecular targets for drug development. Many biochemical by-products have been identified to help in understanding the interaction between the bone and the tumor. Enhanced clinical management of patients with bone metastases was reported during the past decade; however , the anticipated risk and the response to the therapy are still challenging to assess. In this review , the key players that play a dominant role in secondary osteoporosis are addressed. An attempt is made to provide the readers with a clear understanding of the communication pathways between each of the cell types involved in this vicious cycle. Furthermore , the role of Wnts , sclerostin , RANKL , PTHrP , and their respective clinical studies are addressed in this study.
