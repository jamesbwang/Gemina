 There is a paucity of formal clinician education concerning cancer survivorship care , which produces care barriers and poorer outcomes for survivors of childhood cancer. To address this , we implemented a curriculum in childhood cancer survivorship care for pediatric residents at the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA). We examined the efficacy of this curriculum following program completion. A case-based curriculum was created and integrated within existing educational structures using Kern 's model. We utilized the retrospective pre-posttest method to evaluate participating residents ' knowledge , clinical skills , and attitudes towards cancer survivorship topics before and after receiving the curriculum. Pre-posttest items were compared using paired t tests and one-sided binomial tests. We analyzed free-response question items for major themes using constant comparative methods. Thirty-four residents completed the curriculum and its evaluation. Each assessment item significantly increased from pre- to post-curriculum; p < 0.05. Greater than 40 % of residents improved in all but one assessment item post-curriculum; p < 0.05. Residents reported the curriculum enhanced their pediatric knowledge base ( M = 3.24; SD = 0.65) and would recommend it to other residency programs; M = 3.24; SD = 0.69. Major themes included residents ' request for additional oncofertility information , training in counseling survivors , and cancer survivorship training opportunities. A cancer survivorship curriculum can successfully increase trainees ' knowledge , clinical skills , and comfort in discussing topics relevant to survivorship care. With increasing numbers of childhood cancer survivors living into adulthood , residents will likely treat this population regardless of intended career path. This curriculum represents one method to deliver formal cancer survivorship training.
