 In fungi<pathogen> , O-mannosylation is one type of conserved protein modifications that add the carbohydrate residues to specific residues of target proteins by protein O-mannosyltransferases. Previously , three members of O-mannosyltransferases were identified in Magnaporthe oryzae<pathogen> , with MoPmt2 playing important roles in fungal growth and pathogenicity. However , the biological roles of the rest Pmt proteins remain unclear. In this study , to understand if O-mannosyltransferases are crucial for fungal pathogenicity of M. oryzae<pathogen> , the Pmt-coding genes MoPmt1 and MoPmt4 were separately disrupted and their roles in pathogenesis were analyzed. Of the two genes , only MoPmt4 is specifically required for full virulence of M. oryzae<pathogen>. Deletion of MoPmt4 resulted in defects on radial growth , with more branching hyphae and septa as compared to Guy11. The MoPmt4 mutant was severely impaired not only in conidiation , but also in both penetration and biotrophic invasion in susceptible rice plants. This mutant also had defects in suppression of host-derived ROS-mediated plant defense responses that might be ascribed from the reduced activities of extracellular enzymes. Furthermore , like their fungi<pathogen> counterparts , MoPmt4 localized in the ER and had O-mannosyltransferase activity. Domain disruption analysis indicated that mannosyltransferase activity regulated by PMT domain of MoPmt4 is crucial for fungal development and pathogenicity of M. oryzae<pathogen>. Taken together , these data suggest that MoPmt4 is a protein O-mannosyltransferase essential for fungal development and full virulence of M. oryzae<pathogen>.
