 Thyroid cancer has one of the highest hereditary component among human malignancies as seen in medical epidemiology investigations , suggesting the potential meaningfulness of genetic studies. Here we review researches into genetic variations that influence the chance of developing non-familial differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC) , focusing on the major findings of the genome-wide association studies ( GWASs) of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs). To date , eight GWAS have been performed , and the association of a number of SNPs have been reproduced in dozens of replication investigations across different ethnicities , including Korea and Japan. Despite the cumulative effect of the strongest SNPs demonstrates gradual increase in the risk for cancer and their association signals are statistically quite significant , the overall prediction ability for DTC appears to be very limited. Thus , genotyping of common SNPs only would be insufficient for evidence-based counseling in clinical setting at present. Further studies to include less significant and rare SNPs , non-SNP genetic information , gene-gene interactions , ethnicity , non-genetic and environmental factors , and development of more advanced computational algorithms are warranted to approach to personalized disease risk prediction and prognostication.
