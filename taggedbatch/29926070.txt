 To study trafficking of bulk internalized vesicles such as macropinosome and lysosome in live cells , an efficient and convenient assay was established according to the axon turning assay. By injecting indicator or fluorescent dyes through a micropipette with air pressure into cell cultures to create a stable gradient around the micropipette tip , vesicles were indicated and labeled. With live cell imaging , the whole process was recorded. Without wash-out of fluorescent dyes and transferring , this assay is an effective , fast labeling system for bulk internalized vesicles , and can also be combined with imaging system.
