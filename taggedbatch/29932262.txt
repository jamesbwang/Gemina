 Hypoxia-induced damage is one of the key factors associated with islet graft dysfunction. Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) could be used to enhance the therapeutic effect of islet transplantation due to their paracrine potential such as exosomes. In this study , we investigated whether exosomes from human umbilical cord-derived MSC-conditioned medium ( hu-MSC-CM) could increase the survival and function of neonatal porcine islet cell clusters ( NICCs) exposed to hypoxia. Neonatal porcine islet cell clusters were cultured with hu-MSC-CM , with or without exosomes , and native medium RPMI-1640 ( Control) under hypoxic conditions ( 1 % O Compared with NICCs cultured in RPMI-1640 medium and hu-MSC-CM without exosomes , the survival ratio , viability , and function increased in NICCs cultured in hu-MSC-CM with exosomes. This study found that hu-MSC-CM could protect NICCs from hypoxia-induced dysfunction , and exosomes played an important role in hypoxic resistance , suggesting a potential strategy to improve islet transplantation outcomes.
