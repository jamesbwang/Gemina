 Introduction ： To observe the effects of metformin on urinary excretion of MIF , CD74 and podocalyxin in type 2 diabetics and to explore its possible renoprotective mechanisms. 202 uncontrolled type 2 diabetics , who were previously prescribed sulfonylurea monotherapy ( n = 100) or sulfonylurea in combination with metformin ( n = 102) were enrolled in the study. The amount of macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF) and CD74 in serum , urinary MIF to creatine ratio ( UMCR) , urinary CD74 to creatine ratio ( UCCR) , urinary albumin to creatine ratio ( UACR) and urinary podocalyxin to creatine ratio ( UPCR) were determined. Metabolic parameters including fasting blood glucose , postprandial 2 hours blood glucose , hemoglobin A1c , MIF and CD74 in serum were comparable between the two groups. Moreover , metformin add-on therapy showed significantly better efficacy in reducing UMCR , UCCR , UPCR and UACR in comparison with those in sulfonylurea monotherapy group , respectively. UPCR had positive correlation with UACR , UMCR and UCCR ( r ＝ 0.73 , r = 0.69 , r = 0.62 , P < 0.01) , respectively. Metformin could present its podocyte-protective capacity in type 2 diabetics and the underlying mechanisms may be partly attributed to its effects in suppressing MIF-CD74 axis mediated inflammatory cascade response. < p > </ p >.
