 To characterize a single referral center experience with thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH)- staining adenomas. A retrospective chart review was conducted on histopathologic-proven TSH-staining adenomas resected between 2000-2015 at a single center. Tumors were classified as functional ( hormonally active) or silent ( hormonally inactive). Categorical variables were summarized using counts ( n) and percentages; continuous variables were summarized using medians and ranges. From the 1,065 pituitary adenomas operated , 32 ( 3.0 %) showed diffuse staining for TSH. Median ( range) age of patients was 49 years ( 20 to 77 years) , and 21 ( 66 %) were male. Tumor diameter was 20 mm ( 2 to 37 mm) , with 7 ( 22 %) microadenomas and 25 ( 78 %) macroadenomas. Functional tumors ( n = 5 , 16 %) had median diameter of 10 mm ( 5 to 21 mm) ( 2 microadenomas). At diagnosis , median ( range) TSH was 4.3 μU/mL ( 1.2 to 6.9 μU/mL) , and free thyroxine ( FT4) was 2.4 ng/dL ( 2.1 to 3.4 ng/dL). Three tumors stained for TSH alone , and 2 tumors costained with growth hormone ( GH). No cavernous sinus invasion was seen , and 3 ( 60 %) were considered cured after surgery. Silent tumors ( n = 27 , 84 %) had median diameter of 20 mm ( 2 to 37 mm) , with 5 ( 19 %) microadenomas and 22 ( 81 %) macroadenomas. Median ( range) TSH was 1.2 μU/mL ( 0.48 to 4.6 μU/mL) , and FT4 was 1.2 ng/dL ( 0.6 to 1.6). Only 2 ( 7.4 %) tumors stained for TSH alone; the rest were plurihormonal , with GH being the most common. Cavernous sinus invasion was seen in 7 ( 27 %) of the tumors , and 17 ( 63 %) were considered surgically cured. In our series , 22 % of TSH-staining adenomas were microadenomas , and 84 % were silent. Most TSH-staining adenomas were plurihormonal , particularly costaining with GH. αSU = alpha-subunit; ACTH = adrenocorticotropic hormone; FSH = follicle-stimulating hormone; FT3 = free triiodothyronine; FT4 = free thyroxine; GH = growth hormone; LH = luteinizing hormone; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; PRL = prolactin; T4 = thyroxine; TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone.
