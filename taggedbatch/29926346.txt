 The Satisfaction With Life Scale adapted for Children ( SWLS-C) is a self-report measure of children 's quality of life and has exhibited sound psychometric properties. In light of increasing ethno-cultural diversity , it is important to understand child life satisfaction across diverse subgroups. Employing children 's language background as a proxy for cultural background among children in British Columbia , Canada , we examined ( a) the cross-cultural measurement equivalence of the SWLS-C; and ( b) cross-cultural relations of peer support and adult support with SWLS-C. Participants were 20,119 children ( M Findings supported strict measurement equivalence between the English language/cultural background group and all other language/cultural background groups for the SWLS-C. Relative to the English language background group , SWLS-C means differed for several language/cultural background groups. Within every language/cultural background group , however , peer and adult support scale scores were significant positive correlates of SWLS-C scores. This study provided evidence for measurement equivalence of a life satisfaction measure across children from diverse language/cultural backgrounds and identified between-group differences in the level of child life satisfaction that were generally consistent with prior theory and findings. Moreover , results provided evidence of promotive associations of adult support and peer support with life satisfaction among diverse groups of children.
