 Individuals genetically predisposed to pancreatic cancer may benefit from early detection. Genes that predispose to pancreatic cancer and the risks of pancreatic cancer associated with mutations in these genes are not well defined. To determine whether inherited germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes are associated with increased risks of pancreatic cancer. Case-control analysis to identify pancreatic cancer predisposition genes; longitudinal analysis of patients with pancreatic cancer for prognosis. The study included 3030 adults diagnosed as having pancreatic cancer and enrolled in a Mayo Clinic registry between October 12 , 2000 , and March 31 , 2016 , with last follow-up on June 22 , 2017. Reference controls were 123136 individuals with exome sequence data in the public Genome Aggregation Database and 53105 in the Exome Aggregation Consortium database. Individuals were classified based on carrying a deleterious mutation in cancer predisposition genes and having a personal or family history of cancer. Germline mutations in coding regions of 21 cancer predisposition genes were identified by sequencing of products from a custom multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based panel; associations of genes with pancreatic cancer were assessed by comparing frequency of mutations in genes of pancreatic cancer patients with those of reference controls. Comparing 3030 case patients with pancreatic cancer ( 43.2 % female; 95.6 % non-Hispanic white; mean age at diagnosis , 65.3 ( SD , 10.7) years) with reference controls , significant associations were observed between pancreatic cancer and mutations in CDKN2A ( 0.3 % of cases and 0.02 % of controls; odds ratio ( OR) , 12.33; 95 % CI , 5.43-25.61); TP53 ( 0.2 % of cases and 0.02 % of controls; OR , 6.70; 95 % CI , 2.52-14.95); MLH1 ( 0.13 % of cases and 0.02 % of controls; OR , 6.66; 95 % CI , 1.94-17.53); BRCA2 ( 1.9 % of cases and 0.3 % of controls; OR , 6.20; 95 % CI , 4.62-8.17); ATM ( 2.3 % of cases and 0.37 % of controls; OR , 5.71; 95 % CI , 4.38-7.33); and BRCA1 ( 0.6 % of cases and 0.2 % of controls; OR , 2.58; 95 % CI , 1.54-4.05). In this case-control study , mutations in 6 genes associated with pancreatic cancer were found in 5.5 % of all pancreatic cancer patients , including 7.9 % of patients with a family history of pancreatic cancer and 5.2 % of patients without a family history of pancreatic cancer. Further research is needed for replication in other populations.
