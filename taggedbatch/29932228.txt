 ATP-binding cassette ( ABC) transporters act mainly to transport compounds across cellular membranes<symptom> and are important for diverse biological processes. However , their roles in pathogenesis have not been well-characterized in Fusarium<pathogen> graminearum. Sixty F. graminearum ABC protein genes were functionally characterized. Among them , FgArb1 regulates normal growth and importantly is essential for pathogenicity. Thus , the regulatory mechanisms of FgArb1 in pathogenicity were analyzed in this study. FgArb1 interacts with the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) FgSte7 , and partially modulates plant penetration by regulating the phosphorylation of FgGpmk1 ( the downstream kinase of FgSte7). The FgArb1 mutant exhibited dramatically reduced infective growth within wounded host tissues , likely resulting from its increased sensitivity to oxidative stresses , defective cell wall integrity and reduced deoxynivalenol ( DON) production. FgArb1 also is important for the production of sexual and asexual spores that are important propagules for plant infection. In addition , FgArb1 is involved in the regulation of protein biosynthesis through impeding nuclear export of small ribosomal subunit. Finally , acetylation modification at sites K28 , K65 , K341 and K525 in FgArb1 is required for its biological functions. Taken together , results of this study provide a novel insight into functions of the ABC transporter in fungal pathogenesis.
