 Subdural hematoma ( SDH) is a common disease associated with high morbidity , which is becoming more prominent due to the increasing incidence. Decision for a surgical evacuation is made depending on the clinical appearance and the volume of SDH , wherefore it is important to have a simple ` bedside ' method to measure and compare the volume of SDH. The aim of the study was to verify the accuracy of the simplified ABC/2 volumetric formula to determine a valuable tool for the clinical practice. Preoperative CT-scans of 83 patients with SDHs were used for the computer-assisted volumetric measurement via BrainLab ® as well as the ABC/2 volumetric measurement. A = largest length ( anterior to posterior) of the SDH; B = maximum width ( lateral to midline) 90 ° to A; C = maximum height ( coronal plane or multiplication of slices) of the hematoma. These measurements were performed by two independent clinicians in a blinded fashion. Both volumes were compared by linear regression analysis of Pearson and Bland-Altman regression analysis. Among 100 SDHs , 53 % were under an 47 % were over 100cm3 showing a well distribution of the hematoma sizes. There was an excellent correlation between computer-assisted volumetric measurement and ABC/2 ( R2 = 0.947 , p < 0.0001) and no undesirable deviation and trend were detected ( p = 0.101; p = 0.777). A 95 % tolerance region of the ratios of both methods was ( 0.805-1.201). The ABC/2 method is a simple and fast bedside formula for the measurement of SDH volume in a timely manner without limited access through simple adaption , which may replace the computer-assisted volumetric measurement in the clinical and research area. Reason for the good accuracy seems to be the spherical form of SDH , which has a similarity to a half ellipsoid.
