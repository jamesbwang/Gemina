 Periprosthetic joint infection ( PJI) is a catastrophic and potentially life threatening complication following arthroplasty. In addition to the resulting impact on patient morbidity and mortality , PJI is associated with significant financial cost , which is estimated at # 21,937 per case. Methicillin sensitive staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MSSA) is a common isolate in PJI and colonisation is a proven risk factor for subsequent infection. The aims of this study were: ( 1) to determine if MSSA screening and decolonisation reduced MSSA PJI rate in primary joint replacement and ( 2) to determine cost effectiveness of such a screening program. Pre-operative screening for MSSA was introduced in our institution in 2010. All MSSA positive patients attending for elective arthroplasty were prescribed Octenisan body wash and nasal Bactroban for use 5 days prior to procedure , and five days after. Infection data was collected prospectively and compared with a control group from before. Between 2007 and 2014 , 12,910 primary arthroplasties ( 5917 hip , 6993 knee) were performed. There were 3593 in the pre-screening group and 9318 in the post-screening group. Pre-screening PJI MSSA rate was 0.75 % which reduced to 0.25 % post screening introduction ( p < 0.0001). Overall PJI rate fell from 1.92 % to 1.41 % ( p = 0.03). The screening program was most effective in MSSA prevention in total hip arthroplasty ( 3 % to 1.5 % , p = 0.002) and significant in the multivariate analysis. Following the introduction of the screening programme 47 PJIs were avoided , with a cost per infection prevented of # 1893. The MSSA screening and eradication protocol used in our institution was effective at reducing rates of MSSA PJI. Furthermore , it resulted in significant savings when compared to the cost of prevented infections.
