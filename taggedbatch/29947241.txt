 Platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF-BB) is an important factor in the regeneration and wound<disease><symptom> healing. One of the problems is that there is not enough efficiency in the transmission or delivery of such factors in the wound<disease><symptom> site. In this study , alginate sulfate hydrogel was synthesized with recombinant PDGF-BB growth factor for achieving a quick method in wound<disease><symptom> healing. In this study , Alginate sulfate hydrogel was made by photo-crosslinking method and methacrylate. Its toxicity was evaluated by MTT assay. Transforming growth factor was studied in releasing from synthesized alginate sulfate hydrogels and also , lack of toxicity was confirmed , and hydrogel was made with a recombinant human growth factor. Wounds<disease><symptom> were created with a diameter of 10 mm on the back of rats in order to check the wound<disease><symptom> healing. This study showed that alginate sulfate hydrogels-PDGF-BB were faster in wound<disease><symptom> healing than non-sulfate alginate hydrogels-PDGF-BB. Therefore , the controlled delivery of growth factor system can be a powerful idea for therapeutic applications for wound<disease><symptom> healing. Alginate sulfate hydrogel with recombinant growth factor 4 Âµg/cm2 ( PDGF-BB) was very suitable for wound<disease><symptom> healing ( Tab. 1 , Fig. 3 , Ref. 34).
