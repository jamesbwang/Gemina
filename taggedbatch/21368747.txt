 Previous research has shown an effect of various psychosocial stressors on unconstrained cognitive flexibility , such as searching through a large set of potential solutions in the lexical-semantic network during verbal problem-solving. Functional magnetic resonance imaging has shown that the presence of the short ( S) allele ( lacking a 43-base pair repeat) of the promoter region of the gene ( SLC6A4) encoding the serotonin transporter ( 5-HTT) protein is associated with a greater amygdalar response to emotional stimuli and a greater response to stressors. Therefore , we hypothesized that the presence of the S-allele is associated with greater stress-associated impairment in performance on an unconstrained cognitive flexibility task , anagrams. In this exploratory pilot study , 28 healthy young adults were genotyped for long ( L)- allele versus S-allele promoter region polymorphism of the 5-HTT gene , SLC6A4. Participants solved anagrams during the Trier Social Stress Test , which included public speaking and mental arithmetic stressors. We compared the participants ' cognitive response to stress across genotypes. A Gene Ã— Stress interaction effect was observed in this small sample. Comparisons revealed that participants with at least one S-allele performed worse during the Stress condition. Genetic susceptibility to stress conferred by SLC6A4 appeared to modulate unconstrained cognitive flexibility during psychosocial stress in this exploratory sample. If confirmed , this finding may have implications for conditions associated with increased stress response , including performance anxiety<symptom> and cocaine withdrawal. Future work is needed both to confirm our findings with a larger sample and to explore the mechanisms of this proposed effect.
