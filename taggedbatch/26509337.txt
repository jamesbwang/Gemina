 Malaria<disease> is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. It is also a dynamic contributor to poverty through its effects on children 's cognitive development. This paper examines the degree to which malaria<disease> in early childhood impacts on educational achievement in later childhood. The substantial decline in malaria<disease> in the region over recent years allows an assessment of its impact to be made. Focusing on Tanzania , we combine data from the Malaria<disease> Atlas Project and the 2010-2014 Uwezo household surveys ( N = 246,325). We relate the district-level risk of malaria<disease> in a child 's year of birth to his/her performance in tests of acquired cognitive skills ( literacy and numeracy). For causal identification , we rely on differences across districts in the pace of decline in malaria<disease> prevalence occurring over the last 15 years. We control for time-invariant district level , age , birth cohort and survey year effects , as well as district-level trends and individual and household-specific factors. In addition , we use sibling variation in birth-year exposure to malaria<disease> to strengthen our identification. A ten percentage-point decrease in malaria<disease> prevalence in birth year is associated with a 0.06 standard deviation ( p = 0.000) increase in English literacy achievement. This estimate is comparable in magnitude to education intervention programs with very large effects. Our results are robust to a large number of sensitivity analyses. We find no statistically significant effects of birth-year malaria<disease> exposure on attainments in numeracy and Kiswahili , and we argue that this is probably attributable to strong ceiling effects in these test scores. We conclude that in Tanzania malaria<disease> is an important factor in geographical variation in English literacy. This indicates that malaria<disease> is a significant public health challenge to educational achievement in this country , and probably in other regions with malaria<disease>.
