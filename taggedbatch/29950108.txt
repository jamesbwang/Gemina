 HIV<pathogen> testing among men who have sex with men ( MSM) and transgender ( TG) women remains low in Thailand. The HIV<pathogen> prevention program ( PREV) to increase HIV<pathogen> testing and link those who tested HIV-positive to care provided trainings to peer educators to conduct target mapping , identify high risk MSM and TG women through outreach education and offer them rapid HIV<pathogen> testing. Trained hospital staff provided HIV<pathogen> testing and counseling with same-day results at hospitals and mobile clinics and referred HIV-positive participants for care and treatment. We used a standardized HIV<pathogen> pre-test counseling form to collect participant characteristics and analyzed HIV<pathogen> test results using Poisson regression and Wilcoxon rank sum trend tests to determine trends over time. We calculated HIV<pathogen> incidence using data from participants who initially tested HIV-negative and tested at least one more time during the program. Confidence intervals for HIV<pathogen> incidence rates were calculated using the Exact Poisson method. From September 2011 through August 2016 , 5,629 participants had an HIV<pathogen> test; their median age was 24 years , 1,923 ( 34 %) tested at mobile clinics , 5,609 ( 99.6 %) received their test result , and 1,193 ( 21 %) tested HIV<pathogen> positive. The number of people testing increased from 458 in 2012 to 1,832 in 2016 ( p < 0.001). Participants testing at mobile clinics were younger ( p < 0.001) and more likely to be testing for the first time ( p < 0.001) than those tested at hospitals. Of 1,193 HIV-positive participants , 756 ( 63 %) had CD4 testing. Among 925 participants who returned for HIV<pathogen> testing , HIV<pathogen> incidence was 6.2 per 100 person-years. Incidence was highest among people 20-24 years old ( 10.9 per 100 person-years). HIV<pathogen> testing among MSM and TG women increased during the PREV program. HIV<pathogen> incidence remains alarmingly high especially among young participants. There is an urgent need to expand HIV<pathogen> prevention services to MSM and TG women in Thailand.
