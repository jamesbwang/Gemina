 Household dust contains an array of constituents , including house dust mites ( HDM) and the HDM allergen , Der p 1 , which can cause sensitivities such as asthma and eczema<disease><symptom>. Vacuuming can help alleviate symptoms , yet little is understood about cleaning behaviour in different households. This pilot study investigated the contents of dust from four household types ( students; over 65 s; and families with and without pets). This was then related to cleaning behaviours and perceptions of cleanliness. Our investigation found that HDMs and Der p 1 were present in all households and sampling locations , including participants ' cars. The median Der p 1 was greatest in the living room , though results varied. Demographic group was a determinant for the number of human and pet hairs present in dust. Surprisingly , vacuuming was the most disliked task overall. This information requires consideration when developing cleaning products and advising individuals with dust-related health issues.
