 Acetaminophen ( APAP) overdose is a leading cause of drug-induced acute liver failure. Prolonged c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK) activation plays a central role in APAP-induced liver injury; however , growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 beta ( GADD45Î²) is known to inhibit JNK phosphorylation. The orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner ( SHP , NR0B2) acts as a transcriptional co-repressor of various genes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of SHP in APAP-evoked hepatotoxicity. We used lethal ( 750 mg/kg) or sublethal ( 300 mg/kg) doses of APAP-treated wild-type ( WT) , Shp knockout ( Shp
