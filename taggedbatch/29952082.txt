 Salicylic acid ( SA) signalling plays an essential role in plant innate immunity. In this study , we identified a component in the SA signaling pathway in potato ( Solanum tuberosum) , the transcription factor StbZIP61 , and characterized its function in defence against Phytophthora infestans. Expression of StbZIP61 was induced upon P. infestans infection and following exposure to the defense signaling hormones SA , ethylene and jasmonic acid. Overexpression of StbZIP61 increased the tolerance of potato plants to P. infestans while RNA interference ( RNAi) increased susceptibility. Yeast two-hybrid and pull down experiments revealed that StbZIP61 could interact with an NPR3-like protein ( StNPR3L) that inhibited its DNA-binding and transcriptional activation activities. Moreover , StNPR3L interacted with StbZIP61 in an SA-dependent manner. Among candidate genes involved in SA-regulated defense responses , StbZIP61 had a significant impact on expression of StICS1 , which encodes a key enzyme for SA biosynthesis. StICS1 transcription was induced upon P. infestans infection and this responsive expression to the pathogen was reduced in StbZIP61 RNAi plants. Accordingly , StICS1 expression was remarkably enhanced in StbZIP61-overexpressing plants. Together , our data demonstrate that StbZIP61 functions in concert with StNPR3L to regulate the temporal activation of SA biosynthesis , which contributes to SA-mediated immunity against P. infestans infection in potato.
