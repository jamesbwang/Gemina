 Low serum albumin ( S-Alb) is a frequent feature of end-stage renal disease ( ESRD) that independently predicts mortality. Serum albumin has mainly been considered a biomarker of visceral protein and immunocompetence status , fundamental to nutritional assessment. However , low S-albumin level is associated with persistent systemic inflammation<symptom> and many bodies of evidence show that S-Alb has a limited role as a marker of nutritional status. We reported that a low S-Alb concentration was an independent risk factor for poor outcome in ESRD only in the presence of systemic inflammation<symptom>. Moreover , the relationships between inflammatory biomarkers and outcome are confounded also by alterations in body composition ( such as obese sarcopenia) and oxidative stress. Taken together , S-Alb alone should not be used as a proxy of the nutritional status in a dialysis patient. Its association with dietary intake is poor and low S-Alb values are most often non-nutritional in origin. When analyzing S-Alb to predict mortality risk in ESRD , it should always be combined with measurement of hsCRP.
