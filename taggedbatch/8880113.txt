 The aim of this study was to evaluate systemic inflammatory factors and their relation to success or failure in a spontaneous ventilation test. This cross-sectional study included a sample of 54 adult patients. Demographic data and clinical parameters were collected , and blood samples were collected in the first minute of the spontaneous ventilation test to evaluate interleukin ( IL) -1 β , IL-6 , IL-8 , and IL-10 , tumour necrosis<symptom> factor alpha ( TNFα) and C-reactive protein. Patients who experienced extubation failure presented a lower rapid shallow breathing index than those who passed , and these patients also showed a significant increase in C-reactive protein 48 hours after extubation. We observed , moreover , that each unit increase in inflammatory factors led to a higher risk of spontaneous ventilation test failure , with a risk of 2.27 ( 1.001- 4.60 , p = 0.049) for TNFα , 2.23 ( 1.06- 6.54 , p = 0.037) for IL-6 , 2.66 ( 1.06- 6.70 , p = 0.037) for IL-8 and 2.08 ( 1.01- 4.31 , p = 0.04) for IL-10 , and the rapid shallow breathing index was correlated with IL-1 ( r = -0.51 , p = 0.04). C-reactive protein is increased in patients who fail the spontaneous ventilation test , and increased ILs are associated with a greater prevalence of failure in this process; the rapid shallow breathing index may not be effective in patients who present systemic inflammation<symptom>.
