 Due to a lack of longitudinal studies on health in immigrants , the purpose of the present study is to investigate trajectories of health-related quality of life ( HRQoL) in immigrants and non-immigrants in Germany by considering the impact of immigration-related factors. Based on longitudinal SOEP data from 2002 to 2012 , the trajectories of the mental ( MCS) and physical component ( PCS) of HRQoL ( assessed with SF-12v2) were analyzed in 8546 subjects , including 1064 immigrants by conducting hierarchical linear models. MCS remains stable over time , whereas PCS shows a decrease , influenced by increasing age. There were no differences between immigrants and non-immigrants concerning PCS trajectories as well as no influence of immigration-related factors on it. In contrast , MCS trajectories were influenced by immigration-related factors: 2nd-generation immigrants , participants from Turkey or Southern Europe and those who immigrated at young age show a slight decrease in MCS over time. The results show negative association between MCS and time in different groups of immigrants. Future research is needed for better conceptualization of the complex interplay between health and migration over time to identify subgroups at greater risk for mental distress.
