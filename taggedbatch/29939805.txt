 The last decade has seen increased focus on self-efficacy approaches in anti-obesity interventions. Self-efficacy approaches stemming from Bandura 's social cognitive theory involve enhancing the patient 's self-efficacy to ensure behavior change through exercise and dietary changes as well as weight-loss control. Inspired by Barad 's theory of agential realism , this study explores self-efficacy by acknowledging that also non-human entities have agency. Drawing on one adolescent 's experiences of testing herself while running on a treadmill , we put Barad 's concept of `` intra-acting '' into play. Acknowledging the treadmill 's agency as well as the agency of the program itself enables us to see the becoming nature of self-efficacy. As such , reading Bandura 's concept of self-efficacy through Barad helps us discover more clearly the contingent and fluid process of self-efficacy , a process of becoming that needs to account for both human and non-human actors. Regarding how adolescents ' anti-obesity programs can be designed and implemented to enhance self-efficacy , we argue that physiotherapists must understand the intra-active processes involved in such programs.
