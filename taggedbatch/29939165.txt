 We present a method for the generation and coherent manipulation of pulsed quantum frequency combs. Until now , methods of preparing high-dimensional states on-chip in a practical way have remained elusive due to the increasing complexity of the quantum circuitry needed to prepare and process such states. Here , we outline how high-dimensional , frequency-bin entangled , two-photon states can be generated at a stable , high generation rate by using a nested-cavity , actively mode-locked excitation of a nonlinear micro-cavity. This technique is used to produce pulsed quantum frequency combs. Moreover , we present how the quantum states can be coherently manipulated using standard telecommunications components such as programmable filters and electro-optic modulators. In particular , we show in detail how to accomplish state characterization measurements such as density matrix reconstruction , coincidence detection , and single photon spectrum determination. The presented methods form an accessible , reconfigurable , and scalable foundation for complex high-dimensional state preparation and manipulation protocols in the frequency domain.
