 An 83-year-old woman with a Kommerell diverticulum was treated by anatomical endovascular repair with a deep site in-situ fenestration instead of complex debranching techniques. The main component of the thoracic stent-graft was deployed just distal to the third cervical branch to completely exclude the Kommerell diverticulum. A deep site in-situ fenestration was made on the main component using a radiofrequency needle through the left subclavian artery , and a stent-graft was deployed to bridge the main component to the left subclavian artery. Six months postoperatively , the Kommerell diverticulum was completely excluded with excellent left subclavian artery patency.
