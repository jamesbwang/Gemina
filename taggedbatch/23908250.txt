 With today 's National Health Service ( NHS) facing huge financial pressures the healthcare profession can not afford to carry on spending at the current rate. Individual clinicians should be encouraged to critically appraise their own practices to bring about a more efficient and cost-effective service. The purpose of this project was to analyse the way that carpal tunnel surgery was being performed within our institution and bring about safe changes to practice that reduce expenditure. By critiquing our practices and applying simple changes based around sound evidence an annual saving of over # 15500 to the department was made. The changes instigated are simple , sustainable and safe to implement while providing improved patient satisfaction. They are also easily transferrable across institutions and to other minor hand surgical procedures to afford even greater ongoing savings to the NHS.
