 The role of decreased pulmonary arterial ( PA) compliance ( C) , equivalent to increased PA stiffness ( 1/C) , as a critical determinant of right ventricular dysfunction and prognosis has been emphasized in pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH). This study retrospectively reviewed all incident patients diagnosed with idiopathic PAH according to right heart catheterization who were enrolled in the French Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Network registry between 2006 and 2016 and who had complete baseline data allowing calculation of stiffness ( PA pulse pressure/stroke volume index). In the 719 patients included ( median age: 66 years; 53.7 % female) , PA stiffness was 1.49 mm Hg × m In incident idiopathic PAH , PA stiffness was related to mPAP and heart rate , and this finding outperformed the potential influences of age and sex. Baseline PA stiffness did not independently predict outcome. The great dispersion of the PVR × C product implied that PVR and PA stiffness were differently affected by the disease process.
