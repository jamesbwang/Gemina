 Compositional , functional and nutritional properties of fruits are important for defining its quality. Regarding the fact that fruit seeds are also considered to be a good source of bioactive components , their exploitation should be greater. Twenty macro , micro and trace elements were identified and quantified in seeds of 70 genuine wild and cultivated fruits species/cultivars by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Additionally , sophisticated chemometric techniques were applied to establish criteria for classification of analysed samples. Calcium and P were the most abundant elements , followed by K and Na. Micro and trace elements content were differing among the different cultivars/genotypes. The content of Ba , Pb and Sr were statistically significantly higher in wild fruits , while Fe , Mg , Mn , Ni and Zn were higher in cultivated fruits. All employed statistical procedures ( Kruskal-Wallis , Mann-Whitney U-test , and PCA) confirm unique set of parameters that could be used as phytochemical biomarkers to differentiate fruit seeds samples belonging to different cultivars/genotypes according to their botanical origin. This kind of investigation may contribute for the inter-cultivar/genetic discrimination and enhancing the possibilities of acquiring a valuable authenticity factor.
