 To analyse the risk factors for microbiologically documented infection , mortality and hospital stay > 5 days in children with febrile neutropenia. Prospective , cohort study ( July 2013-September 2014). Government-run , tertiary-care , university hospital in Chandigarh , Northern India. 414 episodes in 264 children aged < 12 years , not undergoing stem-cell transplantation. Predictors for ` high-risk ' febrile neutropenia. Microbiologically-documented infections were observed in 82 children ( 19.8 %); bacterial 14.2 % , fungal 4.3 % , polymicrobial 9.7 %. Complications were documented in 109 ( 26 %) children. 43 ( 10.3 %) died: 8 due to fungal and 35 due to bacterial sepsis<disease>. Children admitted within 7 days of the last chemotherapy ( P < 0.01) and having a non-upper respiratory focus of infection ( P < 0.02) were at risk of developing microbiologically-documented infections and death. Platelet count < 20000/uL ( P = 0.03) was an additional predictor for microbiologically-documented infections , while albumin < 2.5 g/dL ( P = 0.04) and C-reactive protein > 90mg/L ( P = 0.02) were risk factors predicting mortality. The median ( IQR) duration of hospital stay was 5 ( 3,8) days. Hospital stay > 5 days was seen in 144 ( 35 %) children. Children with acute myeloid leukaemia ( P < 0.01) and admitted within 7 days of chemotherapy ( P = 0.02) were likely to have a prolonged hospital stay > 5 days. Febrile neutropenic children admitted within 7 days of completion of chemotherapy , those with a non-upper respiratory focus of infection , CRP > 90 mg/dL , platelet < 20000/uL and albumin < 2.5 g/dL need to be considered as ` high risk ' for complications and mortality.
