 The aims of this study were to assess whether computerized attentional training improves dual-tasking abilities in older adults and whether its effect and transfer are modulated by age and the type of training provided. This study also used virtual reality ( VR) as a proxy to measure transfer in a real life related context. Sixty participants ( 30 older and 30 younger adults) were randomized to either: ( a) single-task training ( two tasks practiced in focused attention; visual detection and alphanumeric equation task); or ( b) divided attention variable-priority training ( varying the amount of attention to put on each task when performed concurrently). Training effects were assessed at pre- and post-training with tasks similar to the one used in training. Transfer was measured with the virtual car ride , an immersive dual-task scenario and a self-reported questionnaire. In older adults , variable-priority improved attentional control abilities and led to better transfer in the VR dual-task scenario compared with single-task. Younger adults benefited equally from the two types of training and transfer was found on the Alpha span task when performed concurrently in VR. Single-task improved the ability of all participants to carry out the tasks in the focused attention condition. No transfer effects were found on the self-reported measure for either training type or age. Attention remains plastic in old age and programs designed to improve attentional control might be beneficial to older adults. Importantly , training can produce transfer to more real life related tasks and transfer remains possible throughout the life span. ( PsycINFO Database Record
