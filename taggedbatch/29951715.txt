 The present work reports on the preparation of thin films of pyrene luminophors doped by varying amounts of perylene by spin coating technique. The structural , morphological , and photophysical properties of pyrene thin films have been investigated as a function of perylene contents. X-ray diffraction studies of doped thin films show well-defined peaks , and estimated crystallite size decreases with increasing perylene content , due to the formation of closed packed crystal structure. SEM images of pure pyrene revealed smooth , and compact and separated crystals with amounts of perylene. The result of absorption spectra showed decrease in intensity with perylene content. However , the fluorescence spectra of pyrene containing higher amounts of perylene showed broad and structureless exciplex emission at 510 nm. The emission colour of pyrene luminophors tuned from blue to green by controlling the concentration of perylene. The phenomenon of change in colour was seen due to efficient excitation energy transfer from pyrene to perylene in thin films. It also found that the intensity of exciplex emission increases with increasing concentration of perylene is of high demand in fluorescent lamp as well as green organic light emitting diodes.
