 Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 ( MDA5) dermatomyositis ( DM) is a distinctive subtype of DM that carries a significant risk of interstitial lung disease ( ILD). The mechanisms remain elusive. To explore the role of type I interferon ( IFN) system in the pathogenesis of anti-MDA5 DM. Twenty anti-MDA5 DM patients were studied and compared with anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase ( ARS) DM patients ( n = 10) and autoAb negative DM patients ( n = 20). The levels of inflammatory cytokines , B cell activating factor ( BAFF) , and Krebs von den Lungen-6 ( KL-6) in blood were tested by ELISA and multiplex assays. Expressions of transcripts for IFN-associated sensors and type I IFN inducible genes in PBMCs were detected by real-time PCR analysis. Expressions of STAT1 , ISG15 , and MxA proteins in skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> were analyzed by immunohistochemistry technique. Plasma IFN-α levels were found to dominantly increase in anti-MDA5 DM patients. PBMCs from anti-MDA5 DM patients were shown to have the significant upregulations of TLR3 , TLR7 , MDA5 , RIG-I genes as well as serial IFN-inducible genes. Skin biopsies from anti-MDA5 DM patients were characterized by the strong expressions of STAT1 , ISG15 , and MxA proteins. In the anti-MDA5 DM/ILD patients with high IFN-α production , there was a positive quantitative correlation between IFN-α and BAFF ( r Our data confirm the aberrant activation of type I IFN system in anti-MDA5 DM. Overproduction of IFN-α linked with BAFF may be implicated in the development of ILD. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
