 To investigate the effects of adiponectin ( APN) on anxiety<symptom> and memory<symptom> impairment<symptom> of 9-month-old triple transgenic Alzheimer 's disease ( 3xTg-AD) model mice. The 9-month-old 3xTg-AD mice and C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four groups ( ① In the open field test , compared to WT+S aline group , the time of 3xTg-AD + Saline mice spent in center was significantly decreased , and the time spent in periphery was obviously increased. However , APN treatment effectively reversed the phenomenon appeared in 3xTg-AD mice , indicating that APN could alleviate the anxiety<symptom> observed in 3xTg-AD mice. ② In novel object recognition task , the discrimination index of 3xTg-AD + Saline group was ( -16.7 ± 10.1) % , significantly lower than ( 18.0 ± 8.2) % in WT+S aline group ( Adiponectin could effectively alleviate the anxiety<symptom> and reverse the impairment of recognition memory and working memory of 9-month-old 3xTg-AD mice , and might play an important role in the prevention and treatment of AD.
