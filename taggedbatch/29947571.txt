 Many psychological hypotheses require testing whether the similarity between two variables predicts important outcomes. For example , the ideal standards model posits that the match between ( A) a participant 's ideal partner preferences , and ( B) the traits of a current/potential partner , predicts ( C) evaluative outcomes ( e.g. , the decision to date someone , relationship satisfaction , breakup); tests of the predictive validity of ideal-matching require A × B → C analytic strategies. However , recent articles have incorrectly suggested that documenting a positive samplewide correlation between a participant 's ideals and a current partner 's traits ( an A-B correlation) implies that participants pursued , selected , or desired partners with traits that matched their ideals. There are at least six alternative explanations for the emergence of a samplewide A-B correlation; A-B correlations do not provide evidence that ideals guide the selection/evaluation of specific partners. We review appropriately rigorous A × B → C tests that can aid scholars in identifying the circumstances in which ideal-matching exhibits predictive validity.
