 Herewith , a case is reported of an adolescent female patient with maxillary retrognathism due to restricted growth arising out of the previous cheiloplasty and palatoplasty surgeries treated for cleft lip and palate. She also presented an oroantral fistula<disease> in the scarred tissues of the palatal region. There was anterior crossbite and distorted occlusion in the anterior segment with crowding and open bite. There is maxillomandibular discrepancy of 6 degrees Â°. The distraction osteogenesis was performed so as treat the maxillary hypoplasia. This allows undermanding adaptation of the soft-tissue structures to the modification in the skeletal structures as a result of surgical procedures and ensures long-term stability. A custom made intraoral rapid maxillary expansion device was prepared utilizing the hyrax screw for the distraction of the bony segments. At the end of the treatment and a retention period of 24 months , the patient exhibited improved facial profile and hence esthetics.
