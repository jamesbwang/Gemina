 CD39 and CD73 are surface enzymes that jut into the extracellular space where they mediate the step-wise phosphohydrolysis of the autocrine and paracrine danger signals ATP and ADP into anti-inflammatory adenosine. Given the role of vascular and immune cells ' `` purinergic halo '' in maintaining homeostasis , we hypothesized that the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 might play a protective role in lupus. Lupus was modeled by intraperitoneal administration of pristane to three groups of mice: wild-type ( WT) , CD39 As compared with WT mice , CD39 These data are the first to link ectonucleotidases with lupus autoimmunity and vascular disease. New therapeutic strategies may harness purinergic nucleotide dissipation or signaling to limit the damage inflicted upon organs and blood vessels by lupus.
