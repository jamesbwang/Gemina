 This study aimed to investigate the difference of common adverse events ( AEs) between patients experienced first drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization ( DEB-TACE; FD) and second or higher DEB-TACE ( SHD) , and the factors influencing AEs.Five hundred twenty DEB-TACE records were retrospectively reviewed in this cohort study , among which 284 and 236 records were in FD and SHD groups , respectively. The incidence and/or severity of pain , fever<symptom> , vomiting , and increased blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) were collected.Pain numerical rating scale ( NRS) score , pain severity , body temperature , fever<symptom> severity , and fever<symptom> lasting days were higher in FD group than in SHD group , while no difference of vomiting and increased BP between 2 groups were disclosed. Age â‰¥ 65 years was associated with decreased high fever<symptom> and less possibility of vomiting in FD group , and lower pain and fever<symptom> severity in SHD group; Male decreased the possibility of vomiting in both the groups , and reduced increased BP incidence in SHD group; diabetes history correlated with decreased pain degree and less fever<symptom> in FD group.In conclusion , SHD was better tolerated compared with FD in liver cancer patients , and older age as well as male were correlated with less occurrence or severity of common AEs in DEB-TACE operation.
