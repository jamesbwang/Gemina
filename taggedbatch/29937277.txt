 Functional hyperemia<symptom> , a regional increase of blood flow triggered by local neural activation , is used to map brain activity in health and disease. However , the spatial-temporal dynamics of functional hyperemia<symptom> remain unclear. Two-photon imaging of the entire vascular arbor in NG2-creERT2; GCaMP6f mice shows that local synaptic activation , measured via oligodendrocyte precursor cell ( OPC) Ca
