 Muscle co-activation has been shown to be elevated in individuals with knee osteoarthritis ( KOA) during gait. Comparisons of muscle co-activation across different activities of daily living such as stair negotiation have yet to be explored. The aim of the study was to explore muscle co-activation across different activities of daily living in patients with KOA. Muscle co-activation was assessed in 77 symptomatic KOA participants ( age 62.5 ± 8.1 years; body mass index 29.4 ± 9.0 kg/m Muscle co-activation was highest during stair ascent. When comparing muscle combinations within the same activity correlations ranged from r = 0.003-0.897 of which 80 % of combinations were significant. Between activities muscle co-activation was significantly different ( P < 0.05). Medial: lateral muscle co-activation was higher than hamstrings: quadriceps across activities. Two muscle co-activation strategies were observed during activities of daily living in patients with KOA to maintain stability. Muscle co-activation was higher during more challenging activities , particularly when the joint is accepting load. Medial: lateral muscle co-activation was higher than hamstrings: quadriceps whereby medial: lateral co-activation is thought to be a stabilisation mechanism whilst hamstrings: quadriceps responds to knee flexion moments , suggesting different muscle combinations may have different roles in responding to joint demand.
