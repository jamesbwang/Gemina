 Hallux valgus ( HV) adversely affects quality of life. Patients frequently express concerns regarding postoperative foot appearance , foot width and footwear anticipations. However , only scarce data are available regarding postoperative foot width. Seventy-one cases with moderate<symptom> to severe HV treated with scarf osteotomy were included. The average age was 55.7 years ( range , 20-76) , with average follow-up of 20.7 months ( range , 6-96). Patients ' medical records were reviewed for demographic , operative , and radiographic data. Foot width was assessed radiographically by measuring both bone ( distance between the first and fifth metatarsal heads) and soft<disease> tissue width ( maximal distance of the soft<disease> tissue outline). Preoperative HV deformity ( mean hallux valgus angle ( HVA) 35.8 degrees , intermetatarsal angle ( IMA) 14.1 degrees , and distal metatarsal articular angle ( DMAA) 15.2 degrees) was successfully corrected ( postoperative mean HVA 13.7 degrees , IMA 6.9 degrees , and DMAA 7.7 degrees). Overall bony foot width was reduced by 5 % and soft<disease> tissue foot width by 2 %. Further analysis showed that 13 feet ( 18.3 %) had increased ( > 5 %) bone width , 26 feet ( 36.6 %) with no change ( Â± 5 %) , and 32 feet ( 45.1 %) for which the width decreased ( > 5 %) postoperatively. Angular deformity ( HVA , IMA , and DMAA) showed low correlation with postsurgery foot width. HV surgery effect on foot width was very limited , overall reducing foot width by 2 %. Furthermore , in only about half of the patients , the postoperative foot width decreased , regardless of angular deformity magnitude. Patients with the widest feet had a decrease in foot width following surgery , whereas patients with the narrowest feet had an increase in foot width. Level III , comparative series.
