 Weight is defended so that increases or decreases in body mass elicit responses that favor restoration of one 's previous weight. While much is known about the signals that respond to weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and the central role that leptin plays , the lack of experimental systems studying the overfed state has meant little is known about pathways defending against weight gain. We developed a system to study this physiology and found that overfed mice defend against increased weight gain with graded anorexia<symptom> but , unlike weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , this response is independent of circulating leptin concentration. In overfed mice that are unresponsive to orexigenic stimuli , adipose tissue is transcriptionally and immunologically distinct from fat of ad libitum-fed obese animals. These findings provide evidence that overfeeding-induced obesity alters adipose tissue and central responses in ways that are distinct from ad libitum obesity and activates a non-leptin system to defend against weight gain.
