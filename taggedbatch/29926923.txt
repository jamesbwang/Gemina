 The study and use of punishment in behavioral treatments has been constrained by ethical concerns. However , there remains a need to reduce harmful behavior unable to be reduced by differential-reinforcement procedures. We investigated whether response-contingent presentation of a negative discriminative stimulus previously correlated with an absence of reinforcers would punish behavior maintained by positive reinforcers. Across four conditions , pigeons were trained to discriminate between a positive discriminative stimulus ( S +) signaling the presence of food , and a negative discriminative stimulus ( S-) signaling the absence of food. Once learned , every five responses on average to the S + produced S- for a duration of 1.5 s. S + response rate decreased for a majority of pigeons when responses produced S- , compared to when they did not , or when a neutral control stimulus was presented. In Condition 5 , choice between two concurrently presented S + alternatives shifted away from the alternative producing S- , despite a 1:1 reinforcer ratio. Therefore , presenting contingent S- stimuli punishes operant behavior maintained on simple schedules and in choice situations. Development of negative discriminative stimuli as punishers of operant behavior could provide an effective approach to behavioral treatments for problem behavior and subverting suboptimal choices involved in addictions.
