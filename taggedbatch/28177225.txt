 The effect of the 2-methylimidazole ( Hmim)/ zinc nitrate hexahydrate ( Zn) molar ratio on the physicochemical characteristics of the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 ( ZIF-8) was investigated. ZIF-8 crystals were synthesized by mixing Hmim with Zn at room temperature without any additives in methanol solution. It was found that Hmim/Zn molar ratio had significant influence on the crystallinity , yield , particle size and porosity of ZIF-8. The samples synthesized at low Hmim/Zn molar ratio showed a cubic shape , whereas at higher Hmim/Zn ratios truncated rhombic dodecahedron or rhombic dodecahedron morphologies were obtained. The particle size is decreased upon increasing the Hmim/Zn molar ratio. Besides , higher Hmim/Zn molar ratio in a certain range resulted in improving crystallinity , yield , surface area and micropore volume of ZIF-8. The ZIF-8 crystals produced at Hmim/Zn molar ratio of 8 exhibited the best characteristics. The present work provides new insights in relation to the role of Hmim/Zn molar ratio on the synthesis process of ZIF-8.
