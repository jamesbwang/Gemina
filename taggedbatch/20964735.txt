 Zinc finger ( ZF) protein motifs , stabilized by binding of Zn ( II) , typically function as interaction modules that bind nucleic acids , proteins and other molecules. The elucidation of the redox states of ZF proteins in cellular conditions , which depend on their midpoint redox potentials , is important for understanding of ZF functioning. In the present study we determined the midpoint redox potentials for representatives of Cys
