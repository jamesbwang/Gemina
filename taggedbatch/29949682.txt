 Introduction Evidence suggests that newly licensed physicians are not adequately prepared to prescribe safely. There is currently no national pre-licensure prescribing competency assessment required in North<pathogen> America. This study 's purpose was to survey Canadian medical school leaders for their interest in and perceived need for a nationwide prescribing assessment for final year medical students. Method In spring of 2015 , surveys were disseminated online to medical education leaders in all 17 Canadian medical schools. The survey included questions on perceived prescribing competency in medical schools , and interest in integration of a national assessment into medical school curricula and licensing. Results 372 ( 34.6 %) faculty from all 17 Canadian medical schools responded. 277 ( 74.5 %) respondents were residency directors , 33 ( 8.9 %) vice deans of medical education or equivalent , and 62 ( 16.7 %) clerkship coordinators. Faculty judged 23.4 % ( SD 22.9 %) of their own graduates ' prescribing knowledge to be unsatisfactory and 131 ( 44.8 %) felt obligated to provide close supervision to more than a third of their new residents due to prescribing concerns. 239 ( 73.0 %) believed that an assessment process would improve their graduates ' quality , 262 ( 80.4 %) thought it should be incorporated into their medical school curricula and 248 ( 76.0 %) into the national licensing process. Except in regards to close supervision due to concerns , there were no significant differences between schools ' responses. Conclusions Amongst Canadian medical school leadership , there is a perceived inadequacy in medical student prescribing competency as well as support for a standardized prescribing competency assessment in curricula and licensing processes.
