 Respiratory<symptom> inflammation<symptom> is frequent and fatal pathologic state encountered in veterinary medicine. Although diluted bee venom ( dBV) has potent anti-inflammatory effects , the clinical use of dBV is limited to several chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>. The present study was designed to propose the acupoint treatment of dBV as a novel therapeutic strategy for respiratory<disease> inflammatory<disease> disease<disease>. Experimental pleurisy was induced by injection of carrageenan into left pleural space in mouse. dBV was injected into a specific lung meridian acupoint ( LU-5) or into arbitrary non-acupoint located near the midline of the back in mouse. The inflammatory responses were evaluated by analysis the inflammatory indicators in pleural exudate<symptom>. dBV injection into LU-5 acupoint significantly suppressed the increase of pleural exudate<symptom> volume , leukocyte accumulation , MPO activity. Moreover , dBV acupoint treatment effectively inhibited the production of IL-1β , but not TNF-α in pleural exudate<symptom>. On the other hand , dBV treatment on non-acupoint did not inhibit the inflammatory responses in carrageenan-induced pleurisy. The present results demonstrate that dBV stimulation into the LU-5 lung meridian acupoint produces significant anti-inflammatory effects on carrageenan-induced pleurisy suggesting that dBV acupuncture as a promising alternative medicine therapy for respiratory<disease> inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>.
