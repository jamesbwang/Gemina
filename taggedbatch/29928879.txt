 Mitochondria , the powerhouse of eukaryotic cells , are highly dynamic organelle. Mitochondrial fission , fusion , kissing and contraction have been reported over and over again in non-static cells , such as fibroblast , with tubular mitochondrial networks. Even though the fluorescence propagation among mitochondria of mature cardiomyocytes had been captured using mitochondrial matrix targeted photoactivatable GFP ( PAGFP) or MitoDendra proteins , there are no direct evidence that single real time mitochondrial dynamics events exist in mature cardiomyocytes with ball-like mitochondria. Here we first time revealed the visualizable single mitochondrial dynamics events in adult mature cardiomyocytes by the mitochondrial flash ( mitoflash). We found fission , fusion , contraction and kissing were accompanied by a mitoflash event. Metabolism could increase mitochondrial contraction. Fusion and Kissing mediated inter-mitochondrial communication with higher frequency than fission. These results demonstrate that mitochondria of static mature cardiomyocytes are undergoing the rare , but real dynamics change.
