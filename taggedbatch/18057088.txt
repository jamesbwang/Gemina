 Obesity is characterized by excessive accumulation of body fat , which causes damage to the health of individuals , such as breathing difficulties. To verify the results of non-invasive ventilation as a preventive strategy on the decline of respiratory function and postoperative complications in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This is a randomized trial , according to CONSORT standards , with obese adults aged 18-40 years. Randomized control group ( n = 25) only received guidelines regarding posture<symptom> , early ambulation and cough<symptom> stimuli , and in the NIV group ( n = 25) , in addition to the aforementioned group , non-invasive ventilation was performed with two pressure levels , once day for 60 min , from the 1st to the 3rd postoperative day ( POD). Both groups were evaluated in the preoperative period and in the 1st and 3rd POD for respiratory function , which were: slow vital capacity ( VC) , inspiratory capacity ( IC) , minute volume ( MV) , tidal volume maximal inspiratory muscle strength ( Pimax) and peak expiratory flow ( PEF). The length of hospital stay and the episodes of postoperative complications were recorded. Of the 50 patients the majority were young adults with degrees of obesity between III and IV. In the intergroup analysis , there was an improvement in the CVL and MV only in the 1st POD in the NIV group , CI in the three moments evaluated in the NIV group and the PFE in the 1st and 3rd PDO also in this group. The most frequent complications were pneumonia<disease> , followed by operative wound<disease><symptom> infection<disease> and atelectasis. There was a significant difference between groups , showing a higher occurrence in pneumonia<disease> and atelectasis in the control group. The days of hospitalization and intensive care unit were similar. It was observed a faster recovery until the 3rd POD in the IC and PEF variables in the NIV group; in addition , there were fewer complications in this group.
