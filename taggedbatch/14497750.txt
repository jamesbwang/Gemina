 In this review , we argue for the use of high-resolution computed tomography ( HRCT) over chest X-ray in the initial evaluation of patients with sarcoidosis. Chest X-ray , which has long been used to classify disease severity and offer prognostication in sarcoidosis , has clear limitations compared with HRCT , including wider interobserver variability , a looser association with lung function , and poorer sensitivity to detect important lung manifestations of sarcoidosis. In addition , HRCT offers a diagnostic advantage , as it better depicts targets for biopsy , such as mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy<disease><symptom> and focal parenchymal disease. Newer data suggest that specific HRCT findings may be associated with important prognostic outcomes , such as increased mortality. As we elaborate in this update , we strongly recommend the use of HRCT in the initial evaluation of the patient with sarcoidosis.
