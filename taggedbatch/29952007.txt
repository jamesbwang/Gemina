 Imigliptin is a novel DPP-4 inhibitor , designed to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM). A selective and sensitive method was developed using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ( HPLC-MS/MS) to simultaneously quantify imigliptin , its five metabolites , and alogliptin in human plasma and urine. Solid-phase extraction ( SPE) and direct dilution were used to extract imigliptin , its five metabolites , alogliptin from plasma and urine , respectively. The extracts were injected onto a SymmetryShield RP
