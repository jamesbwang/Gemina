 Short-term viability assays of cultured cells in 96-well plates are routinely used to determine the cytotoxicity or safety of drugs. These are often based on the formation of chromogen , generated selectively in viable cells. The innate problems of such short-term cell viability assays include ( i) effect of drugs is determined by cell density ( ii) some drugs have slow/gradual effect and hence may escape such assays , ( iii) cell morphology that reveal significant hints to molecular signaling underlining the effect of drugs can not be effectively captured , ( iv) long-term effect on viability and clonogenic potential of cells can not be determined and ( v) herbal extracts often possess intrinsic color that interferes with spectrophotometer estimation. In light of the ease and importance of cell culture-based assessment of drug safety and cytotoxicity , we attempted to combine the conventional cell-based assays in a way that allows multiple readouts ( quantitative and qualitative) from a single experiment , and avoids the drawbacks of color interference. We have established and validated ( using 16 types of cultured mammalian cells) a Quantitative and Qualitative Cell Viability assay in 12-well cell culture plates. It overcomes several shortcomings as discussed above and allows long-term observations on cell morphology and clonogenicity.
