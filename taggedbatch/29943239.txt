 Transcranial alternating current stimulation ( tACS) can modulate brain oscillations , cortical excitability and behaviour. In aging , the decrease in EEG alpha activity ( 8-12 Hz) in the parieto-occipital and mu rhythm in the motor cortex are correlated with the decline in cognitive and motor functions , respectively. Increasing alpha activity using tACS might therefore improve cognitive and motor function in the elderly. The present study explored the influence of tACS on cortical excitability in young and old healthy adults. We applied tACS at individual alpha peak frequency for 10 min ( 1.5 mA) to the left motor cortex. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess the changes in cortical excitability as measured by motor-evoked potentials at rest , before and after stimulation. TACS increased cortical excitability in both groups. However , our results also suggest that the mechanism behind the effects was different , as we observed an increase and decrease in intracortical inhibition in the old group and young group , respectively. Our results indicate that both groups profited similarly from the stimulation. There was no indication that tACS was more effective in conditions of low alpha power , that is , in the elderly.
