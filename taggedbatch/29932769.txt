 It has been long known that chronic metabolic disease is associated with a parallel increase in the risk for developing peripheral vascular disease. Although more clinically relevant , our understanding about reversing established vasculopathy is limited in comparison to our understanding of the mechanisms and development of impaired vascular structure/function under these conditions. Using the 13-week old obese Zucker rat ( OZR) model of the metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> , where microvascular dysfunction is sufficiently established to contribute to impaired skeletal muscle function , we imposed a 7-week intervention of chronic atorvastatin ( ATOR) treatment , chronic treadmill exercise ( EXER) , or both. By 20 weeks of age , untreated OZR manifested a diverse vasculopathy that was a central contributor to poor<symptom> muscle performance , perfusion and impaired O
