 Choroidal melanoma is a rare ocular tumor. The present study reports the case of a 66-year-old male who presented with chronic<symptom> headache<symptom> and progressive visual loss. Physical eye examination and combined A- and B-mode ultrasonography detected choroidal melanoma. Due to tumor characteristics the eye was enucleated restoring the orbital volume with a 22 mm intraorbital bioceramic sphere implant. The eye was subjected to histopathological examination that confirmed the choroidal melanoma , 2 cm in diameter and 0.8 cm in elevation , occupying almost half of the globe. Microscopically , the neoplasm comprises mostly of epithelioid cells and fewer Type B spindle cells , with intense pigmentation. AJCC staging for the melanoma was T4b. The patient was fitted with an artificial eye after enucleation. Thirteen months after initial diagnosis , liver metastases were confirmed during his scheduled follow-up.
