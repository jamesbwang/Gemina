 Although argon plasma coagulation ( APC) is the current standard endoscopic treatment for gastric antral vascular ectasia ( GAVE) , radiofrequency ablation ( RFA) has emerged as an attractive alternative. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of RFA and APC in the treatment of GAVE. Searches of PubMed , EMBASE , Web of Science , and Cochrane Library databases along with major gastroenterology annual meetings were performed through March 2017. Measured outcomes for comparative effectiveness and safety including improvement in hemoglobin levels , transfusion dependence , number of treatment sessions , complications , follow-up , and author-reported endoscopic success were compared among RFA and APC studies. In total , 24 studies ( n = 508) involving APC and 9 studies ( n = 104) on RFA were included. Mean age of patients included was comparable in both groups ( 65.33 ± 7.80 y for APC vs. 66.96 ± 6.23 y for RFA; P = 0.98). Pooled mean follow-up was significantly longer for APC compared with RFA ( 19.52 ± 13.11 vs. 7.43 ± 3.72 mo; P < 0.001). In total , 47 % of RFA patients were refractory to previous treatment with APC. RFA required fewer mean treatment sessions compared with APC ( 2.10 vs. 3.39 , respectively; P < 0.001). RFA resulted in fewer and less severe complications as compared with APC ( 1.92 % vs. 5.12 % , respectively; P < 0.001). Although the reported endoscopic success was better with RFA compared with APC ( 97 % vs. 66 %; P < 0.001) , the posttreatment pooled hemoglobin increase and reduction in transfusion dependence was higher for APC compared with RFA ( weighted mean difference 3.10 g/dL ( 95 % confidence interval , 2.92-3.28) vs. 1.95 g/dL ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.62-2.26); P < 0.001; and 88 % vs. 66 %; P < 0.001 , for APC and RFA , respectively). There is limited long-term data on RFA for GAVE; however , available evidence suggests RFA has a comparable efficacy and tolerability compared with APC. In addition , RFA seems to be effective for APC-refractory GAVE patients. Future controlled trials are needed to directly compare treatment efficacy , long-term durability , safety , and cost-effectiveness between these interventions.
