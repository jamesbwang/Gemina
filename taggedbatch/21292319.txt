 Calcium phosphates have long been used as synthetic bone grafts. Recent studies have shown that the modulation of composition and textural properties , such as nano- , micro- and macro-porosity , is a powerful strategy to control and synchronize material resorption and bone formation.Biomimetic calcium phosphates , which closely mimic the composition and structure of bone mineral , can be produced using low-temperature processing routes , and offer the possibility to modulate the material properties to a larger extent than conventional high temperature sintering processes.Advanced technologies open up new possibilities in the design of bioceramics for bone regeneration; 3D-printing technologies , in combination with the development of hybrid materials with enhanced mechanical properties , supported by finite element modelling tools , are expected to enable the design and fabrication of mechanically competent patient-specific bone grafts.The association of ions , drugs and cells allows leveraging of the osteogenic potential of bioceramic scaffolds in compromised clinical situations , where the intrinsic bone regeneration potential is impaired.
