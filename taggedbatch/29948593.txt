 Deep vein thrombosis resulting in lethal pulmonary thromboembolism is not-infrequently encountered in forensic cases. Predisposing factors include immobility , recent surgery , previous deep venous thromboses/pulmonary thromboembolism , indwelling central venous lines , major trauma , the oral contraceptive pill , pregnancy , congenital cardiac disease , sepsis<disease> , malignancy , systemic lupus erythematosus , renal<symptom> failure<symptom> and certain inherited thrombophilias. Venous thrombosis associated with air travel was reported in the early 1950 's and called the `` economy class syndrome<disease><symptom> '' , although it is now recognized that reduced movement on long distance flights is more significant than seating class. Long-distance flights of eight hours or more are associated with a two to fourfold increase in the risk of deep venous thrombosis , but only in those individuals who have underlying risk factors. With increasing numbers of flights of more than 16 h duration forensic pathologists are well placed to monitor the potential impact of extended flying on the incidence of lethal pulmonary thromboembolism.
