 Pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs) derive energy predominantly from glycolysis and not the energy-efficient oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS). Differentiation is initiated with energy metabolic shift from glycolysis to OXPHOS. We investigated the role of mitochondrial energy metabolism in human PSCs using molecular , biochemical , genetic , and pharmacological approaches. We show that the carcinoma protein OCIAD1 interacts with and regulates mitochondrial complex I activity. Energy metabolic assays on live pluripotent cells showed that OCIAD1-depleted cells have increased OXPHOS and may be poised for differentiation. OCIAD1 maintains human embryonic stem cells , and its depletion by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout leads to rapid and increased differentiation upon induction , whereas OCIAD1 overexpression has the opposite effect. Pharmacological alteration of complex I activity was able to rescue the defects of OCIAD1 modulation. Thus , hPSCs can exist in energy metabolic substates. OCIAD1 provides a target to screen for additional modulators of mitochondrial activity to promote transient multipotent precursor expansion or enhance differentiation.
