 As urbanization processes , the increasing direct runoff caused by land use change has become a major challenge for urban hydrological system. In this study , the impact of urbanization on direct runoff in the Shenyang urban area was investigated using a modified Soil Conservation Service Curve Number model combined with remote sensing. Urban functional zone ( UFZ) was used as the basic unit for hydrological analysis. The hydrological changes in runoff were analyzed by calculating the runoff difference between the current condition and the pre-urbanization condition. Moran 's I was used to estimate the spatial autocorrelation of the entire area. Then we assessed the relative influence and marginal effects of factors affecting direct runoff using boosted regression trees ( BRT). Our results showed that direct runoff was significantly related to urbanization. Under current conditions , direct runoff increment depth affected by urbanization in the study area was 68.02 mm. For different UFZs , high-density residential , business and industrial zones tended to have large runoff volumes and high runoff coefficients. Through flooding hazard analysis , we found about 6.53 % of the study area fell into a significant hazard category. The industrial zone had largest area of significant hazard land ( 40.97 km
