 Premature ventricular complex ( PVCs) detected from long-term ECG recordings have been associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. However , there was limited data about the association between high PVCs burdens ( > 10 %) and stroke-like symptoms without a prior diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack in the long-term follow up. The Kosin University 24-hours holter monitoring , echocardiography , electrocardiogram ( ECG) database were reviewed from 2013 to 2015 to identify patients with frequent PVCs ( > 10 %). We compared the long-term clinical outcomes between the patients with frequent PVCs ( > 10 %) and control group without PVC. Among 572 patients who underwent 24-hours holter monitoring , finally , 373 consecutive patients ( mean age; 59.5 Â± 15.8 years , 45.2 % male) were enrolled. Among them , 203 ( 54.4 %) patients had high PVCs burdens ( > 10 %). There was no difference of the baseline characteristics. In the long term follow-up , PVCs burden was not associated with PVCs- related symptoms ( High PVCs burdens ( > 10 %) were associated with and stroke-like symptoms without a prior diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack in the long-term follow up , suggesting more intensive medical therapy with close clinical follow-up will be required.
