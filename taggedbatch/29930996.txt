 The synthesis and characterization of the first examples of bimetallic bis ( alkylidynyl) arsines , ( RAs ( C ( triple bond , length as m-dash) M ( CO) 2 ( Tp *)) 2) ( M = Mo , R = Ph , Me; M = W , R = Ph , Me , nBu; Tp * = hydrotris ( 3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl) borate) are described. For the tungsten complexes , these may be prepared by a potentially generalizable route: successive treatment of ( W ( ( triple bond , length as m-dash) CBr) ( CO) 2 ( Tp *)) with nBuLi , ACl3 ( A = P , As) and a nucleophilic source of R-via the inferred intermediacy of ( ClA ( C ( triple bond , length as m-dash) W ( CO) 2 ( Tp *)) 2).
