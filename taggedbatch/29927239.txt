 Eukaryotic diphthine synthase , Dph5 , is a promiscuous methyltransferase that catalyzes an extraordinary N , O-tetramethylation of 2- ( 3-carboxy-3-aminopropyl)- l-histidine ( ACP) to yield diphthine methyl ester ( DTM). These are intermediates in the biosynthesis of the post-translationally modified histidine residue diphthamide ( DTA) , a unique and essential residue part of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 ( eEF2). Herein , the promiscuity of Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> Dph5 has been studied with in silico approaches , including homology modeling to provide the structure of Dph5 , protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics to construct the Dph5-eEF2 complex , and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics ( QM/MM) calculations to outline a plausible mechanism. The calculations show that the methylation of ACP follows a typical S
