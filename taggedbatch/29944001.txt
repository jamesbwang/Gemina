 Copper-nicotinate complex ( CNC) has antioxidant activities through scavenging of free radicals formed inside the body. CNC also has anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activities. The current study was designed to determine the effect of glycerol on rat kidney function and oxidative stress as well as , the potential nephroprotective effects of CNC. Forty male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four equal groups. The groups of rats were as follows: GI was kept under normal control conditions; GII was orally given CNC at a dose of 0.043 mg kg
