 The subscapular , anterior circumflex , and posterior circumflex arteries arise from the third part of the axillary artery. During dissection of the right upper limb of the cadaver of a 70-year-old male , a common trunk was observed arising from the third part of the axillary artery which , after traveling for 0.5 cm , bifurcated into subscapular and posterior circumflex humeral arteries. The common trunk was crossed anteriorly by the radial nerve. The medial nerve was formed by medial and lateral roots on the medial side of the third part of the axillary artery , remaining medial to the brachial artery up to the cubital fossa and then following its usual course thereafter. Awareness of the vascular variations observed in the present case is important when conducting surgical procedures in the axilla , for radiologists interpreting angiographs , and for anatomy-pathologists studying rare findings.
