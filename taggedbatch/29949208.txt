 EBV viremia and PTLD are severe complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT). A series of risk factors have been found to predict EBV viremia and PTLD , including the T-cell depletion , reduced intensity conditioning and alternative donor , etc.. The rituximab pre-emptive therapy could improve PTLD prognosis significantly , but the trigger of initiating rituximab pre-emptive therapy has not been well established. Additionally , EBV specific cytotoxic T-cell ( CTL) is a promising approach to treat EBV-PTLD. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
