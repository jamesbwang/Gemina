 To examine sex differences in self-ratings for affective and cognitive empathy for males and females with traumatic brain injury ( TBI) and compare these to observer ratings. Self and observer ( e.g. , spouse) ratings of affective and cognitive empathy were obtained for 160 participants ( 116 males) with severe TBI , using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index Empathic Concern ( EC) and Perspective Taking ( PT) subscales , respectively. When compared to sex norms , female self-ratings were significantly lower for both subscales , whereas men 's self-report ratings were only lower for PT. For EC , more women ( 44 %) were found to be substantially below the normative means ( â‰¥ 2 SDs) than men ( 17 %) , p < .001. When comparing women and men with TBI , self-report and observer ratings indicated both sexes had similar empathy levels ( both subscales). Self versus observer ratings showed that women 's self-ratings were significantly higher than observer 's ratings on PT ( p < .001); men 's self-ratings were significantly higher than observer 's ratings on PT ( p < .001) and EC ( p = .009). In contrast to the typically observed superior female empathy , this study suggests this advantage may disappear after a TBI , and possibly result in a disadvantage compared to their uninjured female peers. Theoretical implications of self-awareness and cultural gender expectations for empathy are discussed. ( PsycINFO Database Record
