 Protein synthesis is a fundamental requirement of all cells for survival and replication. To date , vast numbers of genetic and biochemical studies have been performed to address the mechanisms of translation and its regulation in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , but only a limited number of studies have investigated these processes in other bacteria , particularly in slow growing bacteria like Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> , the causative agent of human tuberculosis<disease>. In this Review , we highlight important differences in the translational machinery of M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> compared with E.<pathogen> coli , specifically the presence of two additional proteins and subunit stabilizing elements such as the B9 bridge. We also consider the role of leaderless translation in the ability of M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> to establish latent infection and look at the experimental evidence that translational regulatory mechanisms operate in mycobacteria during stress adaptation , particularly focussing on differences in toxin-antitoxin systems between E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> and on the role of tuneable translational fidelity in conferring phenotypic antibiotic resistance. Finally , we consider the implications of these differences in the context of the biological adaptation of M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> and discuss how these regulatory mechanisms could aid in the development of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis<disease>.
