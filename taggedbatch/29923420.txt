 Continuous-wave Doppler is frequently used for detecting peripheral arterial disease in patients with diabetes; however , there is limited evidence investigating diagnostic accuracy. This study aimed to determine sensitivity and specificity of continuous-wave Doppler for detecting peripheral arterial disease in populations with , and without , diabetes and to investigate the influence of disease severity on sensitivity of continuous-wave Doppler for detecting peripheral arterial disease. Data from 396 participants were included. Using colour Duplex ultrasound as reference standard ( N = 66) , printed continuous-wave Doppler waveform analysis sensitivity was 81.75 % ( 95 % confidence interval: 76.75 to 85.88) and specificity 89.34 % ( 95 % confidence interval: 82.62 to 93.67). Printed continuous-wave Doppler waveform analysis sensitivity for peripheral arterial disease was comparable to sensitivity calculated using angiography as the reference standard ( 81.67 %; 95 % confidence interval: 69.56 to 90.48). Sensitivity and specificity were unaffected by diabetes diagnosis ( n = 176) , sensitivity 82.76 % ( 95 % confidence interval: 74.86 to 88.55) , and specificity 88.33 % ( 95 % confidence interval: 77.82 to 94.23). Continuous-wave Doppler is a fair assessment tool for peripheral arterial disease in a community-based sample with suspected peripheral arterial disease. Diagnostic accuracy of continuous-wave Doppler for peripheral arterial disease is unaffected by the presence of diabetes.
