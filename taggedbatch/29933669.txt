 The electroporation method was performed to transfer plasmid DNA of PBI-1300 carrying GFP gene into Agrobacterium<pathogen> rhizogenes C ₅₈ C ₁ strains. Mediated by A. rhizogenes C ₅₈ C ₁ , the GFP gene were transformed into Erigeron breviscapus aseptic leaves by leaf disc method , then the hairy roots were induced and the infected hairy roots were screened by hygromycin resistance. The chromosomal DNA of the hairy root was used as the templates for the PCR amplification with the GFP-specific primers and then the expected amplified DNA bands appeared , the green fluorescent of GFP in the cut hairy roots was observed by two-photon microscope. These results indicated that GFP gene was integrated into the genome of E. breviscapus and was expressed stably. This study laid the groundwork for foreign gene high-efficiency expression inthe genetic transformation system for hairy root culture of E. breviscapus.
