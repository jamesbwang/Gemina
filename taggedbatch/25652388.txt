 Type 1 diabetes ( T1D) results from a coordinated autoimmune attack of insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas by the innate and adaptive immune systems , beta cell death being predominantly T cell-mediated. In addition to T cells , peripheral B cells are important in T1D progression. The thymus of mice and man also contains B cells , and lately they have been linked to central tolerance of T cells. The role of thymic B cells in T1D is undefined. Here , we show there are abnormalities in the thymic B cell compartment before beta cell destruction and T1D manifestation. Using non-obese diabetic ( NOD) mice , we document that preceding T1D development , there is significant accumulation of thymic B cells-partly through
