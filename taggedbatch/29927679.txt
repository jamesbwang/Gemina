 We propose the recently introduced implicit measure of psychological capital ( PsyCap) , the Implicit Psychological Capital Questionnaire ( I-PCQ; Harms & Luthans , 2012) , can provide a needed valid alternative to the self-report Psychological Capital Questionnaire ( PCQ). We explain the development of the I-PCQ items , assess the structural validity of the instrument , test its vulnerability to response distortion , and assess its capacity to predicting work attitudes and behaviors vis-Ã -vis the PCQ and Big Five personality facets. We found that the I-PCQ demonstrated acceptable structural validity that was consistent with and added to prior theorizing , was resistant to response distortion , and predicted work outcomes above and beyond the widely used self-report PCQ and Big Five personality traits. We conclude that the I-PCQ represents a valid , easily administered measure of psychological capital that minimizes problems associated with self-reports and is appropriate for use in work settings.
