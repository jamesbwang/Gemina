 To date , there are few studies comparing the outcomes of robotic hepatectomy ( RH) versus open hepatectomy ( OH). We report the first systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the outcomes of RH versus OH. A systemic review was performed of all comparative studies of RH versus OH that reported the perioperative outcome ( s) of interest. Seven retrospective cohort studies were included. There was no significant difference in patients ' baseline characteristics. RH was associated with a longer operation time ( mean difference ( MD) 61.47 min; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) ( 7.03 , 115.91); P = 0.03) , shorter hospital stay ( MD -2.57 days; 95 % CI ( -3.31 , -1.82); P < 0.001) , lower costs , less overall ( risk ratio ( RR) 0.63; 95 % CI ( 0.46 , 0.86); P = 0.004) , minor ( RR 0.64; 95 % CI ( 0.43 , 0.95); P = 0.03) and major ( RR 0.45; 95 % CI ( 0.22 , 0.94); P = 0.03) post-operative complications compared to OH. RH had superior perioperative outcomes and was not cost prohibitive compared to OH , but had longer operation times.
