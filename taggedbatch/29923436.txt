 Predicting drug-drug interactions ( DDIs) is an important step during drug development to avoid unexpected side effects. Cytochrome P450 ( CYP) 3A4 is the most abundant human hepatic phase I enzyme , which metabolizes > 50 % of therapeutic drugs. Therefore , it is essential to test the potential of a drug candidate to induce CYP3A4 expression or inhibit its activity. Recently , 3-dimensional ( 3-D) mammalian cell culture models have been adopted in drug discovery research to assess toxicity , DDIs , and pharmacokinetics. In this study , we applied a human 3-D spheroid culture protocol using HepaRG cells combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS) to assess its ability to predict CYP3A4 inhibition. Levels of midazolam , a specific substrate of CYP3A4 , were used to determine the long-term metabolic capacity of CYP3A4. Midazolam was decreased in the 3-D HepaRG culture system by ∼ 80 % over 7 days , whereas its primary metabolite , 1-hydroxymidazolam , increased by ∼ 40 %. Next , we assessed hepatotoxicity by determining the cytotoxicity of known hepatotoxicants in HepaRG spheroids , HepG2 cells , and primary human hepatocytes. Significant differences in cytotoxicity were detected in the system using 3-D HepaRG spheroids. These results suggest that 3-D HepaRG spheroids are a good model for prediction of CYP inhibition and hepatotoxicity in screening of early drug candidates.
