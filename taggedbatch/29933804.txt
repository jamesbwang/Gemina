 The increase in the aging population has led to an overall increase in the number of elderly patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery. This patient population , however , exhibits significant treatment challenges because of poor bone quality. By virtue of exhibiting decreased pullout strength and insertional torque , osteoporotic patients are at a substantial risk of developing vertebral fractures , instrumentation failure , pseudoarthrosis , and proximal junctional failures. It is , therefore , imperative for the treating surgeon to optimize bone health before recommending a spinal fusion surgery. Several preoperative medical therapies ( vitamin D , calcium , bisphosphonates , parathyroid hormone , and so forth) exist to optimize bone health.
