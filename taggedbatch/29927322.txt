 Although the relationship between hereditary hemochromatosis and mutations in the HFE gene was discovered more than 20 years ago , information on the in vivo regulation of HFE protein expression is still limited. The purpose of the study was to determine the response of liver HFE protein content to iron deficiency in mice and rats by immunoblotting. Attempts to visualize the HFE protein in whole liver homogenates were unsuccessful; however , HFE could be detected in liver microsomes or in plasma membrane-enriched fractions. Five week old male C57BL/6 mice fed an iron-deficient diet for four weeks presented with a significant decrease in liver iron content and liver Hamp expression , as well as with a significant decrease in liver HFE protein content. Rats fed an iron-deficient diet for four weeks also displayed significant decrease in liver Hamp expression and liver HFE protein content. These results suggest that the downregulation of HFE-dependent signaling may contribute to decreased Hamp gene expression in states of prolonged iron deficiency. It has recently been proposed that HFE protein could be a potential target of matriptase-2 , a hepatocyte protease mutated in iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia<symptom>. However , immunoblot analysis of HFE protein in the livers from Tmprss6-mutated mask mice did not show evidence of matriptase-2-dependent HFE protein cleavage. In addition , no indication of HFE protein cleavage was seen iron-deficient rats , while the full-length matriptase-2 protein content in the same animals was significantly increased. These results suggest that HFE is probably not a major physiological target of matriptase-2.
