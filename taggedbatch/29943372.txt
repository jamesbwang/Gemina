 A systematic review , meta-analysis , and non-carcinogenic risk considering fluoride content of drinking water resources of 31 provinces of Iran among some international databases such as Science Direct , Scopus , PubMed , and national databases including SID and Irandoc ( 2011 to July 2017) were conducted. In this context , 10 articles ( 40 studies) with 1706 samples were included in meta-analyses and risk assessment studies. The pooled concentration of fluoride in the cold , mild , and warm weather provinces were calculated as 0.39 mg/L ( 95 % CI 0.32-0.48 mg/L) , 0.52 ( 95 % CI 0.43-0.61 mg/L) , and 0.75 ( 95 % CI 0.56-0.94 mg/L) , respectively. The pooled concentration of fluoride in Iranian drinking water resources was 0.51 ( 95 % CI 0.45-0.57 mg/L). The minimum and maximum concentrations of fluoride content were related to Kermanshah ( 0.19 mg/L) and Kerman ( 1.13 mg/L) provinces , respectively. The HQ of fluoride in the children and adults were 0.462 and 0.077 , respectively as children are more vulnerable than adults. The HQ for children and adults was lower than 1 value. Therefore , there is no considerable non-carcinogenic risk for consumers due to drinking water in Iran. Although the non-carcinogenic of fluoride in drinking water was not significant , fluoride entry from other sources , such as food or inhalation , could endanger the health of the residents of Kerman and Bushehr provinces.
