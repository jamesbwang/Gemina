 Suicide is a leading cause of death among 10- to 24-year-old individuals in the United States; evidence on effective treatment for adolescents who engage in suicidal and self-harm behaviors is limited. To evaluate the efficacy of dialectical behavior therapy ( DBT) compared with individual and group supportive therapy ( IGST) for reducing suicide attempts , nonsuicidal self-injury , and overall self-harm among high-risk youths. This randomized clinical trial was conducted from January 1 , 2012 , through August 31 , 2014 , at 4 academic medical centers. A total of 173 participants ( pool of 195; 22 withdrew or were excluded) 12 to 18 years of age with a prior lifetime suicide attempt ( â‰¥ 3 prior self-harm episodes , suicidal ideation , or emotional dysregulation) were studied. Adaptive randomization balanced participants across conditions within sites based on age , number of prior suicide attempts , and psychotropic medication use. Participants were followed up for 1 year. Study participants were randomly assigned to DBT or IGST. Treatment duration was 6 months. Both groups had weekly individual and group psychotherapy , therapist consultation meetings , and parent contact as needed. A priori planned outcomes were suicide attempts , nonsuicidal self-injury , and total self-harm assessed using the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Interview. A total of 173 adolescents ( 163 ( 94.8 %) female and 97 ( 56.4 %) white; mean ( SD) age , 14.89 ( 1.47) years) were studied. Significant advantages were found for DBT on all primary outcomes after treatment: suicide attempts ( 65 ( 90.3 %) of 72 receiving DBT vs 51 ( 78.9 %) of 65 receiving IGST with no suicide attempts; odds ratio ( OR) , 0.30; 95 % CI , 0.10-0.91) , nonsuicidal self-injury ( 41 ( 56.9 %) of 72 receiving DBT vs 26 ( 40.0 %) of 65 receiving IGST with no self-injury; OR , 0.32; 95 % CI , 0.13-0.70) , and self-harm ( 39 ( 54.2 %) of 72 receiving DBT vs 24 ( 36.9 %) of 65 receiving IGST with no self-harm; OR , 0.33; 95 % CI , 0.14-0.78). Rates of self-harm decreased through 1-year follow-up. The advantage of DBT decreased , with no statistically significant between-group differences from 6 to 12 months ( OR , 0.65; 95 % CI , 0.12-3.36; P = .61). Treatment completion rates were higher for DBT ( 75.6 %) than for IGST ( 55.2 %) , but pattern-mixture models indicated that this difference did not informatively affect outcomes. The results of this trial support the efficacy of DBT for reducing self-harm and suicide attempts in highly suicidal self-harming adolescents. On the basis of the criteria of 2 independent trials supporting efficacy , results support DBT as the first well-established , empirically supported treatment for decreasing repeated suicide attempts and self-harm in youths.
