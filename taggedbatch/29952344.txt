 Previous studies have shown a relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus and birth weight. We performed this meta-analysis to resolve the problem of inconsistent results. We conducted a literature search of PubMed , Embase and the Cochrane Library using `` Diabetes Mellitus , Type 2 , '' `` Birth Weight , '' and some related free words. Twenty-one studies were included in accordance with inclusion and exclusion criteria , involving a total of 313,165 participants and 22,341 type 2 diabetes mellitus cases. A modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality of studies included. We used Review Manager 5.3 for data merging and statistical analysis. Results were expressed as odds ratio ( OR) and 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI). The risk of diabetes with low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( < 2,500 g) was higher than that with birth weight â‰¥ 2,500 g , ( OR = 1.51 , 95 % CI: 1.43 , 1.58). Compared with normal birth weight ( 2,500-4,000 g) , low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight , but not high birth weight , increased the risk of diabetes ( OR = 1.41 , 95 % CI: 1.26 , 1.58). There is a negative association between birth weight and the future risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
