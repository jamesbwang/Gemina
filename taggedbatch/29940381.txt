 To assess computed tomography scans to evaluate the extent of reduction of fracture displacement and fracture gap after anterior odontoid screw fixation using the Herbert screw. Thirty-seven odontoid fractures were reduced and treated by anterior odontoid screw fixation with the Herbert screw. There were 37 patients whose age ranged from 20 to 79 years. Three-dimensional computed tomography scans were obtained for all patients to assess the screw position , the presence of the penetration of superior cortex of dens , the extent of reduction of fracture displacement , and fracture gap. Mean fracture displacement was 2.6 ± 3.2 mm before surgery; after the operation this value was 1.0 ± 1.5 mm. The difference in fracture gap between the preoperative and the postoperative state was -0.1 ± 1.1 mm , which was not statistically significant ( P = 0.667). We achieved cortical purchase in only 16 of 37 patients ( 43.2 %); cortical purchase was not obtained in 21 patients ( 56.7 %) due to the fear of the risk of the damage of neural and vascular structures. Of these 21 patients who had no penetration of the superior cortex of dens , widening of the fracture gap occurred in 12 patients ( 57 %) , no change in 6 patients ( 29 %) , and there was shortening in 3 patients ( 14 %). However , of the 16 patients with penetration of apical dens tip , we achieved significant reduction of fracture gap ( P = 0.002). To maximize reduction of fracture gap using the Herbert screw , it is essential to penetrate the apical dens tip.
