 The association between metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> and colorectal cancer ( CRC) has been suggested as one of causes for the increasing incidence of CRC , particularly in younger age groups. The present study examined whether the current age threshold ( 50 years) for CRC screening in Korea requires modification when considering increased metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom>. We analyzed data from the National Health Insurance Corporation database , which covers ~ 97 % of the population in Korea. CRC risk was stratified according to age and the presence or absence of relevant metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> components ( diabetes , dyslipidemia , and hypertension). A total of 51,612,316 subjects enrolled during 2014 to 2015 were analyzed. Among them , 19.3 % had diabetes , hypertension , dyslipidemia , or some combination thereof. This population had a higher incidence of CRC than did those without these conditions , and this was more prominent in subjects ï¼œ 40 years of age. The optimal cutoff age for detecting CRC , based on the highest Youden index , was 45 years among individuals without diabetes , dyslipidemia , and hypertension. Although individuals with at least one of these components of metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> had the highest Youden index at 62 years old , the value was only 0.2. Resetting the cutoff age from 50 years to 45 years achieved a 6 % increase in sensitivity for CRC detection among the total population. Starting CRC screening earlier , namely , at 45 rather than at 50 years of age , may improve secondary prevention of CRC in Korea.
