 The accumulation and deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in brain tissue is the main event in the pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative disorders grouped under the term of synucleinopathies. They include Parkinson 's disease , dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. To date , the diagnosis of any of these disorders mainly relies on the recognition of clinical symptoms , when the neurodegeneration is already in an advanced phase. In the last years , several efforts have been carried out to develop new diagnostic tools for early diagnosis of synucleinopathies , with special interest to Parkinson 's disease. The Protein-Misfolding Cyclic<symptom> Amplification ( PMCA) and the Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion ( RT-QuIC) are ultrasensitive protein amplification assays for the detection of misfolded protein aggregates. Starting from the successful application in the diagnosis of human prion diseases , these techniques were recently tested for the detection of misfolded α-synuclein in brain homogenates and cerebrospinal fluid samples of patients affected by synucleinopathies. So far , only a few studies on a limited number of samples have been performed to test PMCA and RT-QuIC diagnostic reliability. Neverthless , these assays have shown very high sensitivity and specificity in detecting synucleinopathies even at the pre-clinical stage. Despite the application of PMCA and RT-QuIC for α-synuclein detection in biological fluids is very recent , these techniques seem to have the potential for identifying subjects that will be likely to develop synucleinopathies.
