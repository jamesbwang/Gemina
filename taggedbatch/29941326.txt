 Influenza<pathogen><disease> immunization is universally recommended during pregnancy to protect mothers and their offspring. However , pregnancy-induced shifts in vaccine responsiveness remain poorly defined. Quantitative and qualitative shifts in the serological response to influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccination were evaluated in healthy women throughout the course of pregnancy. Serum was obtained before and after vaccination among 71 pregnant and 67 non-pregnant women during the 2011-12 and 2012-13 influenza<pathogen><disease> seasons. Serum hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI) assay was used to investigate anti-influenza antibody responses by comparing pre-vaccine and post-vaccine geometric mean titers ( GMTs) between groups for each antigen. IgG1 , IgG2 , IgG3 , and IgG4 anti-influenza titers were also evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). Pregnancy induced shifts in HAI titers and levels of each anti-influenza antibody isotype were evaluated using linear regression models. Post-vaccine GMTs at day 28 were significantly reduced for women vaccinated during pregnancy for A/California ( H1N1<pathogen>) in 2011 ( p = 0.027) , A/Perth ( H3N2<pathogen>) in 2011 ( p = 0.037) , and B/Wisconsin in 2012 ( p = 0.039). Vaccine responses progressively declined with the initiation of vaccination later in pregnancy. Anti-H1N1 IgG1 , IgG2 , and IgG3 titers were reduced in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant controls , and these titers declined with pregnancy progression. The most striking differences were found for anti-H1N1 IgG1 , where titers decreased by approximately 7 % each week throughout pregnancy. HAI responses elicited by immunization were significantly reduced during pregnancy for three different influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccine antigens. Anti-H1N1 IgG1 was significantly lower in pregnant women and decreased throughout the course of pregnancy. Waning serological responsiveness to influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccination with the progression of human pregnancy has important translational implications for when immunization should be optimally administered during pregnancy.
