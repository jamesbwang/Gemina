 In animals with functional division of blood systemic and pulmonary pressures , such as mammals , birds , crocodilians and a few exceptions among non-crocodilian reptiles , the vessel walls of systemic and pulmonary arteries are exquisitely adapted to endure different pressures during the cardiac cycle , systemic arteries being stronger and stiffer than pulmonary arteries. However , the typical non-crocodilian reptile heart possesses an undivided ventricle that provides similar systolic blood<symptom> pressures<symptom> to both circuits. This raises the question whether in these species the systemic and pulmonary mechanical vascular properties are similar. Snakes also display large organ plasticity and increased cardiac output in response to digestion , and we speculate how the vascular circuit would respond to this further stress. We addressed these questions by testing the mechanical vascular properties of the dorsal aorta and the right pulmonary artery of fasted and fed yellow anacondas ,
