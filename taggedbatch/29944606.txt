 The proven effectiveness of neuromodulation and stimulation techniques for the management of psychiatric disorders has brought strongly needed innovation in psychiatry , given the high prevalence and high costs of treatment resistance. Although evidence-based guidelines in neuromodulation have been implemented to improve the clinical efficacy , safety , and research procedures , practical suggestions on how to design a psychiatric neuromodulation unit ( PNU) are not available in the scientific literature. In this contribution , we have combined the results of a literature search with the suggestions of clinical psychiatrists , managers , and bioethicists who have had firsthand experience in building a PNU. Eleven key issues concerning the implementation and management of a PNU were identified: general context , team composition , environment , basic technical equipment , clinical versus research activities , target clinical population , education and training , interdisciplinarity , ethical aspects , regulatory and reimbursement issues , fund-raising , and partnership development. Moreover , a business plan comprising pragmatic solutions and recommendations for designing an efficient PNU was laid out.
