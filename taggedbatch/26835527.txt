 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the repeatability and matching accuracy between two identical intraoral spectrophotometers. The maxillary right central incisor , canine , and mandibular left central incisor of each of 30 patients were measured using 2 identical intraoral spectrophotometers with different serial numbers ( EasyShade V). The color of each shade tab from 3 shade guides ( VITA 3D-Master) was also determined with both devices. All measurements were performed by a single operator. Statistical analyses were performed to verify the repeatability , accuracy , and the differences between the devices with paired t-tests , one-way ANOVA , and intra-class correlation coefficients ( ICCs) ( Î± = .05). A high level of measurement repeatability ( ICC > 0.90) among Although two EasyShade V devices with different serial numbers show high repeatability of CIE L
