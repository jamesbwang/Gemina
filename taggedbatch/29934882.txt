 Detection of Strongyloides stercoralis larvae is particularly challenging because only a small number of larvae are released into the feces , regardless of infection stage. Our objective was to apply conventional polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) to the detection of S. stercoralis DNA in feces samples to evaluate its performance in samples of patients with strongyloidiasis and compare results with those of immunodiagnosis. Stool<symptom> , serum , and saliva samples were collected from each individual ( n = 48) at the clinic hospital of the State University of Londrina , Brazil , for parasitological , immunological , and molecular tests. Stool<symptom> samples were processed via parasitological methods. Serum samples were used for immunoglobulin G ( IgG) detection and saliva samples for IgA detection by ELISA. For amplification by conventional PCR , two different primers were used: species specific ( 101 bp) and genus specific ( 392 bp). The results showed that 34 ( 97.1 %) of the 35 copro-positive individuals for S. stercoralis were positive for serum IgG and 19 ( 54.3 %) were positive for salivary IgA. Regarding molecular analysis , both primers ( species and genus specific) demonstrated positivity in 100 % of the samples , which was confirmed by sequencing the positive samples. Complementary examinations of the parasitological method demonstrated excellent results in the context of the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis , especially in asymptomatic patients with irregular larval release in the feces.
