 Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC) treatment is mainly based on clinical staging. We hypothesize that better understanding of the molecular heterogeneity of NPC can aid in better treatment decisions. Therefore , the purpose of this study was to present our exploration of cancer gene copy-number alterations ( CNAs) of Epstein-Barr<disease> virus ( EBV)- positive and EBV-negative NPC. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was applied to detect CNAs of 36 cancer genes ( n = 103). Correlation between CNAs , clinicopathological features , and survival were examined. The CNAs occurred significantly more in EBV-negative NPC , with PIK3CA and MCCC1 ( P < .001) gain/amplification occurring more frequently. Gain/amplification of cyclin-L1 ( CCNL1) and PTK2 ( P < .001) predict worse disease-free survival ( DFS) in EBV-positive NPC. The EBV-positive and EBV-negative NPC show some similarities in cancer gene CNAs suggesting a common pathogenic route but also important differences possibly indicating divergence in oncogenesis. Copy number gain/amplification of CCNL1 and PTK2 are possibly good predictors of survival in EBV-positive NPC.
