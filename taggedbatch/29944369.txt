 The selective construction of bicyclo ( 3.3.0) octan-1-ols and bicyclo ( 3.1.0) hexan-1-ols was achieved by using an allylSmBr/additive ( s) system. By employing HMPA as the only additive , the momoallylation/ketone-alkene coupling occurred preferably and afforded bicyclo ( 3.3.0) octan-1-ols in good yields with high diastereoselectivities. While the ester-alkene coupling predominated to generate bicyclo ( 3.1.0) hexan-1-ols in moderate yields with excellent diastereoselectivities in the presence of a proton source , such as pyrrole as the coadditive with HMPA. The tunable reactivity of allylSmBr by additive ( s) would make it a versatile reagent in organic synthesis.
