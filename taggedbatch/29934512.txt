 To estimate the risks of term-small for gestational age ( SGA) , preterm-appropriate for gestational age ( AGA) , and preterm SGA associated with maternal height and body mass index ( BMI) and to calculate the population attributable fractions ( PAF) of term SGA , preterm AGA , and preterm SGA associated with maternal short stature. A population-based cohort of 13,230 women with pre-pregnancy height and weight followed from 2012 to 2016 in Sylhet , Bangladesh. We analyzed data of 2655 singleton live born infants. The babies born < 37 weeks of gestation were considered preterm and weight < 10th percentile of Intergrowth sex-specific gestational age were considered SGA. Risk factors for term SGA , preterm AGA , and preterm SGA were examined using multinomial logistic regression that estimated relative risk ratios ( RRR) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI). Maternal short stature < 145 cm was significantly associated with term SGA ( RRR 1.88 , 95 % CI 1.37 , 2.58; p < 0.001) , preterm AGA ( RRR 1.45 , 95 % CI 1.02 , 2.05; p < 0.05) , and preterm SGA ( RRR 14.40 , 95 % CI 1.82 , 113.85; p < 0.05). Maternal underweight status ( BMI < 18.5 kg/m To address the problem of undernutrition , Bangladesh needs to strengthen implementation of its multi-sectoral nutrition program comprising nutrition specific and sensitive interventions. Implementation of the program with high coverage and quality would improve maternal nutrition and perinatal outcomes including preterm births and SGA.
