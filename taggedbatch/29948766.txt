 Epidermal growth factor receptors EGFR and ErbB2 are overexpressed in schwannomas and meningiomas. Preclinical and clinical data indicate that lapatinib , an EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor , has antitumor activity against vestibular schwannomas in neurofibromatosis type 2 ( NF2) patients. Its antitumor activity against meningiomas , however , is unknown. We conducted a retrospective review of patients with NF2 and progressive vestibular schwannomas treated on a phase 2 clinical trial with lapatinib ( NCT00973739). We included patients with at least one volumetrically measurable meningioma ( > 0.5 cm Eight patients ( ages: 20-58 years) who met criteria had 17 evaluable meningiomas with a combined volume of 61.35 cc at baseline , 61.17 cc during treatment , and 108.86 cc ( + 77.44 % change) off-treatment , p = 0.0033. Median time on-treatment and off-treatment was 15.5 and 16.7 months , respectively. On-treatment mean and median annualized growth rates were 10.67 and 1.32 % , respectively. Off-treatment mean and median annualized growth rates were 20.05 and 10.42 % , respectively. The best volumetric response was- 26.1 % after 23 months on lapatinib. Two tumors increased > 20 % volumetrically on-treatment , compared to eight tumors off-treatment. These data suggest that lapatinib may have growth-inhibitory effects on meningiomas in NF2 patients , and support prospective studies of lapatinib for NF2 patients with progressive meningiomas.
