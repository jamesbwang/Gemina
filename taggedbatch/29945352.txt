 A growing body of scientific evidence suggests that enrichment of certain nutritional compounds in the brain may reduce the risk of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). To investigate the impact of supplemental xanthophyll carotenoids plus omega-3 fatty acids on disease progression in patients with AD. Three trial experiments were performed. In Trials 1 and 2 ( performed on patients with AD over an 18-month period) , 12 patients ( AD status at baseline: 4 mild and 8 moderate) were supplemented with a xanthophyll carotenoid only formulation ( Formulation 1; lutein: meso-zeaxanthin: zeaxanthin 10:10:2 mg/day) and 13 patients ( AD status at baseline: 2 mild , 10 moderate , and 1 severe) were supplemented with a xanthophyll carotenoid and fish oil combination ( Formulation 2; lutein: meso-zeaxanthin: zeaxanthin 10:10:2 mg/day plus 1 g/day of fish oil containing 430 mg docohexaenoic acid ( DHA) and 90 mg eicopentaenoic acid ( EPA)) , respectively. In Trial 3 , 15 subjects free of AD ( the control group) were supplemented for 6 months with Formulation 1. Blood xanthophyll carotenoid response was measured in all trials by HPLC. Omega-3 fatty acids were profiled by direct infusion mass spectrometry. Xanthophyll carotenoid concentration increases were significantly greater for Formulation 2 compared to Formulation 1 ( p < 0.05) , and progression of AD was less for this group ( p = 0.003) , with carers reporting functional benefits in memory , sight , and mood. This preliminary report suggests positive outcomes for patients with AD who consumed a combination of xanthophyll carotenoids plus fish oil , but further study is required to confirm this important observation.
