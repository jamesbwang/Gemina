 A gold ( I)- catalyzed protocol for intermolecular 1,6-conjugate addition of nucleophilic allenol ester generated in situ through ( 3,3)- sigmatropic rearrangement with p-quinone methides ( p-QMs) has been developed. The gold catalyst plays a dual role by the Ï€-acid-triggered activation of alkynes and at the same time as a Lewis acid for activation of p-QMs toward nucleophilic attack. This method enables rapid access to a wide range of densely functionalized diarylmethine-substituted enones , a Morita-Baylis-Hillman ( MBH) product with high selectivity , excellent yields , and broad substrate scope.
