 Infections , cytopenia<symptom> , and gastrointestinal ( GI) toxicity are adverse events of special interest ( AESI) affecting most relapsed Philadelphia chromosome-negative ( Ph-) B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( ALL) patients. This study quantified real-world rates and economic burden of these events among relapsed Ph- B-cell ALL patients in the United States. Adults with relapsed Ph- B-cell ALL during 1 April 2009-31 October 2016 were selected from MarketScan ® healthcare claims databases. Outcomes included proportions of patients with AESIs and AESI-related costs during 100 days after relapsed hospitalization. Of 400 relapsed Ph- B-cell ALL patients , 92.5 % experienced ≥ 1 AESI during the median 100-day follow-up , of which 64.6 % had infections , 94.6 % cytopenia<symptom> , and 46.2 % GI toxicities. Mean ( SD; median) AESI-related total cost per patient during follow-up was $ 197,213 ( $ 308,551; $ 105,731) , with a mean of 2 AESI-related hospitalizations comprising 32.2 inpatient days. Mean ( SD; median) healthcare costs were highest for infections ( $ 164,461 ( $ 347,083; $ 64,528)) , followed by cytopenia<symptom> ( $ 125,210 ( $ 165,141; $ 67,475)) and GI events ( $ 11,652 ( $ 40,231; $ 1349)). The economic burden of AESIs is substantial , with infections the most expensive , followed by cytopenia<symptom> and GI toxicity. New therapies that can improve outcomes in relapsed Ph- B-cell ALL while offering a favorable safety profile are needed.
