 Recently , long noncoding RNAs have emerged as new gene regulators and prognostic markers in several cancers , including renal cell carcinoma ( RCC). Here , we focused on the long noncoding RNA lung cancer associated transcript 1 ( LUCAT1) based on clear cell RCC ( ccRCC) the cancer genome atlas ( TCGA) data. However , whether aberrant expression of LUCAT1 in ccRCC is correlated with malignancy , metastasis or prognosis has not been elucidated. In the current study , we found that the expression of LUCAT1 was upregulated in ccRCC tissues and cancer cell lines. Upregulated LUCAT1 was positively correlated with larger tumor size , advanced tumor-node-metastasis ( TNM) stage , higher smoking frequency , nodal metastasis and shorter overall survival in patients with ccRCC. Inhibition of LUCAT1 by small interfering RNA reduced cell proliferation and invasion of ccRCC cells in vitro. In vivo assay showed that the tumor volume and weight were lower in the group of LUCAT1 inhibition than that in the control group. We then found that LUCAT1 directly bound and inhibited the expression of micoRNA-495-3p ( miR-495-3p) , which subsequently regulated the expression of special adenine-thymine ( AT)- rich DNA-binding protein 1 ( SATB1). Collectively , LUCAT1 was critical for proliferation and invasion of ccRCC cells by regulating miR-495-3p and SATB1. Our findings indicated that LUCAT1 and miR-495-3p may offer potential novel therapeutic targets of treatment of ccRCC.
