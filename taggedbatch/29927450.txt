 ZIP8 is a recently identified membrane transporter which facilitates uptake of many substrates including both essential and toxic divalent metals ( e.g. zinc , manganese , iron , cadmium) and inorganic selenium. Many ZIP8 regulated downstream signals and pathways remain to be elucidated. In this study , we investigated ZIP8 regulatory roles in downstream targets in ZIP8-gain and loss cells and in ZIP8 overexpressed lungs. Our results show that the overexpression of ZIP8 in mouse fibroblast cells ( MEF) induces significant morphological change and re-organization of filament actin ( F-actin) , along with increased cell proliferation and migration rate. In ZIP8 knockout chronic myelogenous leukemia<disease> HAP1 cells , significant clonal morphological change with increased cell-cell adhesion was observed. In the ZIP8 overexpressed lung , F-actin was aberrantly enriched around the tracheal branch. In these ZIP8 gain and loss cell lines and ZIP8 transgenic lungs , we identified two relevant transcription factors , NF-κB and Snail2 , whose activation is dependent on the ZIP8 level. They were both significantly upregulated in ZIP8 overexpressed cells and lungs. Expression of NF-κB and Snail2 targets , COL1A2 and E-cadherin , was also correspondingly elevated. Taken together , our results suggest that ZIP8 is a new regulator for cell morphology and cytoskeleton which involves NF-κB and Snail2.
