 Myotoxicity is a significant factor contributing to the poor adherence and reduced effectiveness in the treatment of statins. Genetic variations and high drug plasma exposure are considered as critique causes for statin-induced myopathy ( SIM). This study aims to explore the sequential influences of rosuvastatin ( RST) pharmacokinetic and myopathy-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) on the plasma exposure to RST and its metabolites: rosuvastatin lactone ( RSTL) and N-desmethyl rosuvastatin ( DM-RST) , and further on RST-induced myopathy. A total of 758 Chinese patients with coronary artery disease were enrolled and followed up SIM incidents for 2 years. The plasma concentrations of RST and its metabolites were determined through a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method. Nine SNPs in six genes were genotyped by using the Sequenom MassArray iPlex platform. Results revealed that ABCG2 rs2231142 variations were highly associated with the plasma concentrations of RST , RSTL , and DM-RST ( P
