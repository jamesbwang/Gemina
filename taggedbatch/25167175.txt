 to identify the support actions undertaken for the woman during labor , birth , cesarean section and the postpartum period. a transversal study , undertaken in three public maternity hospitals , with a sample of 1,147 companions. The data were collected through interviews and were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The support actions were classified in four dimensions: emotional , physical , informational and relating to intermediation. the majority of interviewees were the partner/father of the baby ( 76.7 %). In labor , birth and the postpartum period , the actions of emotional support- such as calming , encouraging and praising , were performed by more than 80.0 % of the companions; informational support , by approximately 70.0 %; and intermediation by fewer than 65.0 % of them. In childbirth , the emphasis on physical support was observed in assisting with walking ( 84.4 %) , and in changing position ( 90.4 %). the companions participate actively in the birth process , performing actions of support in the four dimensions. Emotional support is the most frequent , followed by physical and informational support , mainly during labor and birth. The results contribute to valuing the companion from the woman 's social network in the birth scenario and to the recognition of his/her role as a provider of support.
