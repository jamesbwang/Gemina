 Aiming to explore elevated temperatures as a tool for miniaturization of biodegradable polymer multilayer capsules , assembled on spherical vaterite micron- and submicron-sized particles , we subject the shells composed of dextran sulfate ( DS) and poly-L-arginine ( Parg) to a heat treatment. Changes of the capsule size are studied at various temperatures and ionic strengths of the continuous phase. Unlike some synthetic polymer multilayer shells ( their response to heat treatment depends on the number of layers and their arrangement) , the biodegradable Parg/DS capsules exhibit size reduction and profound compaction regardless of their initial size , number of polymer layers and polymer layer sequence. The capsule response to heat is stable at ionic strengths of the continuous phase not exceeding 0.1 M NaCl.
