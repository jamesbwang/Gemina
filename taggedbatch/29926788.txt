 Anguillonema iranicum n. sp. is described and illustrated as the second species of this genus from Iran , based on morphological , morphometric and molecular characteristics. It is identified by a short , thin body , a continuous lip region , six lines on the lateral field , a short , thin stylet , a posteriorly located pharyngo-intestinal junction to excretory pore , the presence of a post-vulval uterine sac , vulval position at 89 % ( 87.4-89.9 %) of body length , an elongate conoid tail with a rounded to pointed tip and not dorsally bent , and common functional males with short spicules and lacking a bursa. Morphological differences between the new species and the three known species of the genus , namely A. amolensis , A. crenati and A. poligraphi , are discussed. Molecular phylogenetic studies of the new species using partial 18S rDNA sequence revealed that it formed a sister clade with three species of Howardula , one species of Anguillonema and one unidentified isolate. In phylogenetic analyses using partial sequences of 28S rDNA D2-D3 segment , the new species formed a clade with two isolates of Parasitylenchus. A key to identification of Anguillonema species is also presented.
