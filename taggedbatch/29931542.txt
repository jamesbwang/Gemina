 Immunoglobulin ( IgG) 4-related diseases ( IgG4-RDs) are fibro-inflammatory conditions characterized by tumorous swelling and serum IgG4 levels. Intrapelvic IgG4-RD has been subclassified according to the localization site and aortic shape as IgG4-related aortic<disease> aneurysms<disease> ( IgG4-AAs) , periaortitis ( IgG4-PA) , and retroperitoneal fibrosis<disease> ( IgG4-RF). The IgG4-AA pathogenesis would involve interleukin ( IL) -6 upregulation , and Th2-predominant and Treg-activated immune conditions. We characterized the features of intrapelvic IgG4-RD lesions<symptom> , including presence of vascular lesions<symptom>. The clinical , serological , and pathological features , including cytokines concerning Th1/2 and Treg ( IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-10 , IL-13 , and interferon-gamma) of patients with IgG4-AAs ( n = 24) , IgG4-PA ( n = 8) , and IgG4-RF ( n = 10) were retrospectively compared. Clinical symptoms , such as low-grade fever<symptom> , abdominal/lumber pain , and anemia<symptom> , were frequently detected in IgG4-AAs but rarely in IgG4-RF. Serum IL-6 and C-reactive protein ( CRP) were significantly higher in IgG4-AAs and IgG4-PA than in IgG4-RF. Pathologically , IL-6 + cells were more frequently detected in IgG4-PA and IgG4-AAs than in IgG4-RF. There were no noteworthy differences in the clinical complications , white blood cell counts , serum IgE , and serum and immunopositive cells of other cytokines between the subgroups. Among IgG4-AAs and IgG4-PA , serum IL-6 and IL-6 + cells correlated with CRP , aortic diameter , and periaortic fibrosis<disease>. IgG4-AA and IgG4-PA , but not IgG4-RF , were characterized by `` inflammatory '' features , such as increased CRP and serum/pathological IL-6 , and clinical inflammatory symptoms; thus , IgG4-AA and IgG4-PA belong to the same group as IgG4-related vascular disease. High levels of CRP and IL-6 would be hallmarks of IgG4-related vascular disease.
