 We assessed aversion to injections using an avoidance-learning paradigm. Holstein calves ( n = 24) were randomly assigned to one of four routes of administration for 0.5 ml of saline: intramuscular ( IM) , intranasal ( IN) , subcutaneous ( SC) and a null control. Calves were first trained to approach a milk reward of 1 L. Once the latency to approach the reward was consistent , calves received their assigned treatment when approaching the bottle. For the first 3 treatment sessions calves received a 1 L milk reward. This reward was then reduced to 500 mL , and then to 250 mL , and finally to 0 mL , each for 3 sessions. Compared to control calves , calves receiving the intramuscular injections showed a longer latency to approach the milk reward , but only when the milk reward was 0.25 L ( P = 0.05) and 0 L ( P < 0.01). Calves receiving the intranasal injections showed longer latencies relative to the controls only for the 0 L reward ( P = 0.01). Calves receiving the subcutaneous injections did not differ from controls for any of the milk rewards ( P > 0.2). We conclude that IM injections are aversive and that SC and IN routes are a refinement to be considered when feasible.
