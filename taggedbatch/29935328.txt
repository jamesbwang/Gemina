 Elastography point quantification ( ElastPQ) is a non-invasive method for assessing liver fibrosis<disease> based on liver stiffness. We evaluated the accuracy of ElastPQ for the staging of liver fibrosis<disease> in patients with chronic liver disease ( CLD) compared with aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index , fibrosis-4 index , and transient elastography ( TE) , using liver biopsy as reference standard. We performed a retrospective study of 406 patients with CLD of any etiology who underwent liver biopsy analysis from September 2012 through June 2017 at a clinic in Bologna , Italy. We obtained liver stiffness measurements , made by ElastPQ and TE , for 361 patients. Liver fibrosis<disease> stage was assessed by the METAVIR scoring system. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUROC) were used to assess the diagnostic performance of ElastPQ. ElastPQ values correlated with histologic detection of fibrosis<disease> ( r = 0.718; P < .001). The AUROC values were 0.856 for detection of significant fibrosis<disease> ( F ≥ 2) , 0.951 for advanced fibrosis<disease> ( F ≥ 3) , and 0.965 for cirrhosis. The best cut-off values identified for classifying patients with F ≥ 2 , F ≥ 3 , or cirrhosis were 6.0 kPa , 6.2 kPa , and 9.5 kPa , respectively: these were lower than those for TE. Comparison of ElastPQ with TE data resulted in superimposable diagnostic accuracy of both methods for each stage of liver fibrosis<disease>. Both elastography techniques performed better than aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index or fibrosis-4 index scores ( P < .05 for all AUROC comparisons). ElastPQ has good to excellent performance for the non-invasive staging of liver fibrosis<disease> in patients with CLD. ElastPQ identified patients with fibrosis<disease> or cirrhosis with levels of accuracy that were not inferior to those of TE , and outperformed serum fibrosis<disease> indexes in identifying each stage of liver fibrosis<disease>.
