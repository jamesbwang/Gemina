 Duraplasty is a technique successfully used to treat Chiari malformation type I ( CM-I). This study describes the timely manner of clinical outcomes and the postoperative course after craniectomy and duraplasty for the treatment of symptomatic CM-I in children. A retrospective chart review was performed in 105 consecutive children who underwent surgical decompression of symptomatic CM-I with dural opening by a single surgeon between 1999 and 2015. In 16 of 28 children ( 57 %) with typical Valsalva-related/tussive and mixed headaches<symptom> , the symptoms resolved before discharge; by 6 months , all children were headache-free. Two of 28 children ( 7 %) had recurrent headaches<symptom> 9 months after surgery. Among the 78 children with syrinx , syrinx resolved or decreased in 68 ( 87 %) , recurred in 8 ( 10 %) , and was stable in 2 children ( 3 %). Syrinx was resolved or decreased by 3 months in 51 children ( 65 %) and by 6 months in 62 children ( 79 %). Complications included aseptic meningitis<disease><symptom> requiring reoperation in 3 children ( 3 %) and infection in one child ( 1 %). Twelve children underwent reoperation , none within the first 30 days. No child had a major morbidity or mortality. In carefully selected children with CM-I , a high success rate can be achieved with suboccipital decompression and duraplasty. Valsalva-related/tussive headaches<symptom> resolved by the time of discharge from the hospital in the majority of children , and syrinx resolved or decreased in two-thirds of the children by 3 months. By 6 months , headaches<symptom> were resolved in all cases , and syrinx was resolved or decreased in 79 % of cases.
