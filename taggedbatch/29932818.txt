 This study examined the assessment approach interviewers use while conducting interviews to assess truth as narratives are gathered in children 's disclosure statements by examining 100 forensic interviews completed at a Children 's Advocacy Center. A descriptive review was used to examine the steps engaged by interviewers as they followed a protocol and content analysis was used to identify interviewers ' questioning strategies as they assessed children 's disclosure narratives during interviews. Findings indicate that interviewers apply a protocol in order to support advancing to a phase of eliciting details in children 's narratives. Questioning strategies included using a variety of question types to progress from general to specific , incorporating interview aids sparingly as necessary , and integrating multidisciplinary team feedback. Findings suggest that an assessment approach is inherent to the process of actively conducting a forensic interview. Rather than assessment beginning strictly upon completion of children 's narratives , this paper describes how interviewers incorporate an assessment framework throughout interviewing.
