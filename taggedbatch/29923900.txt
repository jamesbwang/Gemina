 To present an evaluation of a surfactant-containing polymeric membrane foam wound<disease><symptom> dressing for use on patients with chronic pilonidal sinus disease. This continuing education activity is intended for physicians , physician assistants , nurse practitioners , and nurses with an interest in skin and wound<disease><symptom> care. After completing this continuing education activity , you should be able to: 1. Recall risk factors for and pathophysiology of pilonidal sinus wounds<disease><symptom> .2. Summarize the evidence-based elements of wound<disease><symptom> assessment and treatment .3. Identify the study methodology and results. To evaluate the clinical use of a surfactant-containing polymeric wound<disease><symptom> dressing with glycerin in patients with chronic pilonidal sinus wounds.This case series was conducted in an outpatient dermatology and wound<disease><symptom> clinic. Sixteen patients aged between 18 and 49 years with chronic nonhealing pilonidal<disease> sinus wounds<disease><symptom> over 4 weeks in duration were recruited.Dressing changes were performed daily because of frequent contamination from bowel evacuation , sweating , or frictional forces in the perianal and intergluteal skin. Patients were seen at follow-up visits to the clinic at weeks 4 , 8 , and 12 from study initiation.Subjects were predominantly males ( 81 % ( n = 13)) with a mean age of 23 years. At study initiation , the mean wound<disease><symptom> duration was 3.2 months , and mean surface area was 3.3 cm ( 0.18-19.6 cm). The majority of wounds<disease><symptom> showed signs of superficial<disease> infection<disease> ( 63 % ( n = 10)) and deep infection ( 88 % ( n = 14)). At week 12 , 10 wounds<disease><symptom> ( 63 %) had closed , 1 ( 6 %) had decreased in surface area , 2 ( 13 %) had increased in size , and 3 ( 19 %) of the patients were lost to follow-up. Mean pain score was 3.4 at first visit; most patients reported reduction in pain scores by weeks 4 and 12. Participants reported improved mobility and ability to self-apply dressing. No adverse reactions were observed.Use of a surfactant-containing polymeric membrane foam wound<disease><symptom> dressing with glycerin may have facilitated wound<disease><symptom> closure in 10 of 13 patients who completed the 12-week study.
