 This study aimed to examine longitudinal changes in isometric strength of the knee extensors ( ImKE) and knee flexors<symptom> ( ImKF) at 30 ° and 60 °. The sample was composed of 67 players aged 11.0-13.9 years at baseline over five years. Stature , body mass , skinfolds , and isometric strength ( ImKE30 ° , ImKF30 ° , ImKE60 ° and ImKF60 °) were measured. Fat mass and fat-free mass ( FFM) were derived from skinfolds. Skeletal age was obtained using TW2 RUS. Multilevel random effects regression analyses extracted developmental polynomial models. An annual increment on chronological age ( CA) corresponded to 5.6 N ( ImKE30 °:) , 2.7 N ( ImKF30 °:) , 4.6 N ( ImKE60 °:) and 1.5 N ( ImKF60 °). An increment of 1 kg in FFM predicted isometric strength as follows: 1.2 N ( ImKE30 °) , 2.1 N ( ImKF30 °) , 3.1 N ( ImKE60 °) and 2.0 N ( ImKF60 °). The following equations were obtained: ImKE30 ° = 5.759 × CA +1.163 × FFM; ImKF30 ° = -19.369 +2.691 × CA +0.693 × CA
