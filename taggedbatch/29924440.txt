 ABC triblock copolymer assemblies with reversible `` breathing '' behaviors based on poly ( oligo ( ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate)- b-poly ( benzyl methacrylate)- b-poly ( 2- ( diethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) ( POEGMA-b-PBnMA-b-PDEA) are fabricated via one-pot sequential reverisble addition-fragmentation chain transfer dispersion polymerization. Using a POEGMA as the macromolecular chain transfer agent , chain extension with BnMA and DEA is conducted in ethanol , where PBnMA acts as the core-forming block , and the PDEA block endows the solvophilicity and CO
