 Glycosylation is a key posttranslational modification that tags protein to membranes<symptom> , organelles , secretory pathways , and degradation. Aberrant protein glycosylation is present both in acquired diseases , such as cancer and neurodegeneration , and in congenital disorders of glycosylation ( CDGs). Consequently , the ability to interrogate the activity of enzymes that can modify protein glycan moieties is key for drug discovery projects aimed at finding modulators of these enzymes. To date , low-throughput technologies such as SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry have been used , which are not suitable for compound screening in drug discovery. In the present work , a broadly applicable time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( TR-FRET) assay was developed that can determine the activity of endoglycosidase enzymes in high-throughput formats. The assay was validated using PNGaseF and EndoH as tool deglycosylases. Even though the current setup is based on the recognition of glycans that bind concanavalin A ( ConA) , the assay concept can be adapted to glycans that bind other lectins.
