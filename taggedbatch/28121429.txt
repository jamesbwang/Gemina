 There is high uncertainty in the direct radiative forcing of black carbon ( BC) , an aerosol that strongly absorbs solar radiation. The observation-constrained estimate , which is several times larger than the bottom-up estimate , is influenced by the spatial representativeness error due to the mesoscale inhomogeneity of the aerosol fields and the relatively low resolution of global chemistry-transport models. Here we evaluated the spatial representativeness error for two widely used observational networks ( AErosol RObotic NETwork and Global Atmosphere Watch) by downscaling the geospatial grid in a global model of BC aerosol absorption optical depth to 0.1 ° × 0.1 °. Comparing the models at a spatial resolution of 2 ° × 2 ° with BC aerosol absorption at AErosol RObotic NETwork sites ( which are commonly located near emission hot spots) tends to cause a global spatial representativeness error of 30 % , as a positive bias for the current top-down estimate of global BC direct radiative forcing. By contrast , the global spatial representativeness error will be 7 % for the Global Atmosphere Watch network , because the sites are located in such a way that there are almost an equal number of sites with positive or negative representativeness error.
