 Bioresorbable bone adhesives have potential to revolutionize the clinical treatment of the human skeletal system , ranging from the fixation and osteointegration of permanent implants to the direct healing and fusion of bones without permanent fixation hardware. Despite an unmet need , there are currently no bone adhesives in clinical use that provide a strong enough bond to wet bone while possessing good osteointegration and bioresorbability. Inspired by the sandcastle worm that creates a protective tubular shell around its body using a proteinaceous adhesive , a novel bone adhesive is introduced , based on tetracalcium phosphate and phosphoserine , that cures in minutes in an aqueous environment and provides high bone-to-bone adhesive strength. The new material is measured to be 10 times more adhesive than bioresorbable calcium phosphate cement and 7.5 times more adhesive than non-resorbable poly ( methyl methacrylate) bone cement , both of which are standard of care in the clinic today. The bone adhesive also demonstrates chemical adhesion to titanium approximately twice that of its adhesion to bone , unlocking the potential for adherence to metallic implants during surrounding bony incorporation. Finally , the bone adhesive is shown to demonstrate osteointegration and bioresorbability over a 52-week period in a critically sized distal femur defect in rabbits.
