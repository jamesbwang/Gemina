 The study of ancient genomes can elucidate the evolutionary past. However , analyses are complicated by base-modifications in ancient DNA molecules that result in errors in DNA sequences. These errors are particularly common near the ends of sequences and pose a challenge for genotype calling. I describe an iterative method that estimates genotype frequencies and errors along sequences to allow for accurate genotype calling from ancient sequences. The implementation of this method , called snpAD , performs well on high-coverage ancient data , as shown by simulations and by subsampling the data of a high-coverage Neandertal genome. Although estimates for low-coverage genomes are less accurate , I am able to derive approximate estimates of heterozygosity from several low-coverage Neandertals. These estimates show that low heterozygosity , compared to modern humans , was common among Neandertals. The C + + code of snpAD is freely available at http://bioinf.eva.mpg.de/snpAD/. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
