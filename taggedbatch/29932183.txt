 IMes-derived thioureas in which the imidazolyl ring is directly substituted by one or two dimethylamino groups are redox-active , exhibiting one and two oxidized states , respectively. The structure , stability , and electronics of the oxidized species are investigated , emphasizing the decisive role of the amino substituents.
