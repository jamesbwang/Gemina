 Healthcare providers do not uniformly screen young patients for exposure to bullying , and no screening instruments have been developed for widespread use in clinical settings. The objectives of this study were to ( a) generate scale items by identifying and eliciting concepts relevant to youths with potential exposure to bullying as well as to professionals who work with bullied youths and ( b) assess the content validity of the new Child-Adolescent Bullying Scale ( CABS) instrument. A mixed-methods design was used to develop an initial pool of 52 items. The study was conducted in four phases: ( I) comprehensive review of the existing literature; ( II) concept elicitation through the conduct of focus groups with school-age youths and professionals who work with bullied youths; ( III) concept selection and item construction; and ( IV) content validation assessment of relevance , clarity , and dimension of each item by a panel of 30 international bullying and measurement experts through completion of an online survey. An initial pool of 52 potential items was developed during Phases I-III of the study. During Phase IV , item- and scale-level content validity indices were calculated and were used to refine the item pool. These strategies resulted in a new , 22-item tool , with scale-level content validity indices of .954 for clarity and .920 for representativeness. Evaluation of the CABS tool with a sample of youths drawn from healthcare settings will be necessary to assess the performance of the CABS items , further evaluate its psychometric properties , and further refine the tool.
