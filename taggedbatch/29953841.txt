 Evidence Connection articles provide a clinical application of systematic reviews developed in conjunction with the American Occupational Therapy Association 's ( AOTA 's) Evidence-Based Practice Project. In this Evidence Connection article , we describe a case report of a person who underwent a total knee replacement due to severe osteoarthritis of his left knee. The occupational therapy assessment and intervention process both before and after surgery in the home setting is described. Findings from the systematic review ( Dorsey & Bradshaw , 2017) on this topic were published in the January/February 2017 issue of the American Journal of Occupational Therapy and in AOTA 's Occupational Therapy Practice Guidelines for Adults With Musculoskeletal Conditions. Each article in this series summarizes the evidence from the published reviews on a given topic and presents an application of the evidence to a related clinical case. Evidence Connection articles illustrate how the research evidence from the reviews can be used to inform and guide clinical reasoning.
