 Detection of healthcare-associated infection ( HAI) clusters is crucial in limiting disease transmission AIM: To investigate whether data on antibiotic use can be an alternative indicator for the identification of HAI clusters caused by multidrug-resistant organisms ( MDROs). We retrospectively analysed MDRO-related HAIs and the 10 indicators of antibiotic use from four independent high-risk units at a tertiary hospital in China from January 2014 to January 2017. Spearman 's correlation test was used to evaluate the correlations between the variables , and Shewhart chart algorithm was used to evaluate the performances of clusters identification. We identified 856 MDRO-related HAI cases. All indicators of antibiotic use were positively correlated with the incidence of MDRO-related HAIs ( r = 0.2 âˆ¼ 0.5; p < 0.05) , except for the `` antibiotics utilization rate ( AUR) for single agent use '' ( r = -0.191; p = 0.017) and the `` AUR of unrestricted drugs '' ( r = -0.042 , p = 0.601). Shewhart chart algorithm identified 22 clusters of MDRO-related HAI. The `` AUR of special-grade antibiotics '' , the `` AUR for 3 agents use in combination '' , and `` The number of antibiotic-variety per patient '' displayed the optimal predictive values for detecting these 22 MDRO-related HAI clusters. At an acceptable specific level of 75 % , these three indicators were considered as the optimal surveillance indicators for detecting MDRO-related HAI clusters , with sensitivities from 80.00 % to 95.00 % , and positive predictive values from 71.05 % to 77.50 %. The use of data on antibiotic use is a sensitive method for identifying clusters of MDRO-related HAIs in high-risk units and may be a useful adjunctive method for HAI surveillance.
