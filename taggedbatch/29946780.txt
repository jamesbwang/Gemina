 The beginning of the twenty-first century offered new advances in cancer research , including the expansion of the knowledge about the tumor microenvironment ( TME). Because TMEs provide the niches in which cancer cells , fibroblast , lymphocyte<symptom> , and immune cells reside , they play a key role in cancer cell development , differentiation , survival , and proliferation. Throughout cancer progression , the TME constantly evolves , causing cancer cells to adapt to the new conditions. The heterogeneity of cancer , evidenced by diverse proliferation rates , cellular structure , metabolism , and gene expression , presents challenges for cancer treatments despite the advances in research. This chapter discusses how different tumor microenvironments lead to specific metabolic adaptations which drive cancer progression.
