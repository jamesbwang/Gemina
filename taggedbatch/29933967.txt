 Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of cognitive and behavioral deficits in children in the US each year. None of the current diagnostic tools , such as quantitative cognitive and balance<symptom> tests , have been validated to identify mild traumatic brain injury in infants , adults and animals. In this preliminary study , we report a novel , quantitative tool that has the potential to quickly and reliably diagnose traumatic brain injury and which can track the state of the brain during recovery across multiple ages and species. Using 32 scalp electrodes , we recorded involuntary auditory event-related potentials from 22 awake four-week-old piglets one day before and one , four , and seven days after two different injury types ( diffuse and focal) or sham. From these recordings , we generated event-related potential functional networks and assessed whether the patterns of the observed changes in these networks could distinguish brain-injured piglets from non-injured. Piglet brains exhibited significant changes after injury , as evaluated by five network metrics. The injury prediction algorithm developed from our analysis of the changes in the event-related potentials functional networks ultimately produced a tool with 82 % predictive accuracy. This novel approach is the first application of auditory event-related potential functional networks to the prediction of traumatic brain injury. The resulting tool is a robust , objective and predictive method that offers promise for detecting mild traumatic brain injury , in particular because collecting event-related potentials data is noninvasive and inexpensive.
