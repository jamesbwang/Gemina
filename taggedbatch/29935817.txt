 Our objectives were to develop an economic model to estimate the economic impact of twinning in dairy cows and to evaluate management strategies to mitigate the negative economic impact of twinning in dairy herds. A probabilistic tree considering spontaneous embryo reduction , early pregnancy loss , abortion<disease><symptom> , metritis , retained placenta , and culling rate at 120 d of the second , at the end of the second , and at the end of the third lactation was developed for a single pregnancy; we also developed 3 management options upon diagnosis of a twin pregnancy , including ( 1) do nothing , ( 2) induction of abortion<disease><symptom> using PGF
