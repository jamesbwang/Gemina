 To show long-term cardiovascular safety of the GLP-1 receptor agonists for diabetes patients with cardiovascular risk. For cardiovascular outcomes , the association between treatment and outcomes was estimated using the odds ratio and 95 % confidence interval. I We combined data from four cardiovascular outcomes trials and prospectively blinded endpoint adjudication. 4105 cardiovascular events including cardiovascular death , acute MI or stroke experienced during the trials. And the odds ratios of the cardiovascular outcomes were 0.90 ( 95 % CI 0.81 , 1.00) for the cardiovascular outcome , 0.93 ( 95 % CI 0.85 , 1.02) for nonfatal myocardial infarction , 0.88 ( 95 % CI 0.76 , 1.03) for nonfatal stroke , 0.94 ( 95 % CI 0.84 , 1.05) for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> hospitalization , 0.89 ( 95 % CI 0.63 , 1.27) for pancreatitis<disease> , 0.98 ( 95 % CI 0.92 , 1.05) for any hypoglycemic events , 0.92 ( 95 % CI 0.83 , 1.01) for the severe hypoglycemic events , 0.96 ( 95 % CI 0.83 , 1.01) for serious adverse events. Significant differences showed in mortality parameters: 0.88 ( 95 % CI 0.81 , 0.95) for all-cause mortality , 0.87 ( 95 % CI 0.79 , 0.97) for cardiovascular mortality. CV benefits were obtained in the male , black , Asian patients and patients with BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m Additional GLP-1 receptor agonists treatment did not increase cardiovascular outcomes in diabetes patients with high cardiovascular risk or established cardiovascular disease.
