 Carbapenems , a family of Î²-lactam antibiotics , are among the most powerful bactericidal compounds in clinical use. However , as rational engineering of native carbapenem-producing microbes is not currently possible , the present carbapenem supply relies upon total chemical synthesis of artificial carbapenem derivatives. To enable access to the full diversity of natural carbapenems , we have engineered production of a simple carbapenem antibiotic within Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. By increasing concentrations of precursor metabolites and identifying a reducing cofactor of a bottleneck enzyme , we improved productivity by 60-fold over the minimal pathway and surpassed reported titers obtained from carbapenem-producing Streptomyces<pathogen> species. We stabilized E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> metabolism against antibacterial effects of the carbapenem product by artificially inhibiting membrane synthesis , which further increased antibiotic productivity. As all known naturally occurring carbapenems are derived from a common intermediate , our engineered strain provides a platform for biosynthesis of tailored carbapenem derivatives in a genetically tractable and fast-growing species.
