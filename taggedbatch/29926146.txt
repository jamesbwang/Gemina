 A multidisciplinary urinary<disease> tract dilation ( UTD) classification system was published in 2014 to standardize definitions and renal/bladder ultrasound image interpretation. To evaluate intra- and inter-rater reliability of this system on postnatal RBUS. Renal/bladder US of 60 infants ( < 12 months) with urinary<disease> tract dilation were anonymized , retrospectively reviewed and scored twice using the UTD classification system by a pediatric urologist and four pediatric radiologists. Exams included supine and prone images of each kidney. Raters recorded the anterior posterior renal pelvis diameter in each position; and when present calyceal dilation ( central and peripheral) , ureteral dilation , parenchymal and bladder abnormalities. A UTD score was given to each kidney based on these components. Intraclass correlation ( ICC) of anterior posterior renal pelvis diameter measures was 0.99 ( P < 0.001). Intra-rater reliability for the anterior posterior renal pelvis diameter of each kidney was high , with ICC > 0.95 ( P < 0.001). Inter-rater kappa values for UTD scores of both kidneys ranged from 0.60 to 0.77 ( P < 0.001). Intra-rater kappa values for UTD scores of both kidneys ranged from 0.74 to 0.92 ( P < 0.001). Of the six categories comprising the UTD score , discrepancy between raters was highest for interpretation of central and peripheral calyceal dilation. Present inter- and intra-rater reliability findings were similar to those previously reported for grading systems for urinary<disease> tract dilation. Across these studies , kappa values are generally lower than the 0.8 cut-off advocated for medical measures. Here , calyceal dilation commonly determined the kidney UTD score and was also the source of greatest discrepancy between raters. Improving consistency of calyceal dilation interpretation may improve UTD consensus score reliability.
