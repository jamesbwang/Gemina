 To determine rates of gastrostomy ( GT) in very low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( VLBW) infants. Retrospective , cross-sectional analysis of the Kids ' Inpatient Database for the years 2000 , 2003 , 2006 , 2009 and 2012. We identified VLBW births and infants undergoing a GT , with and without fundoplication , using ICD-9-CM codes. National rates ( per 1000 VLBW births) of GT increased from 11.5 GT ( 95 % CI 10-13) in 2000 to 22.9 ( 95 % CI 20-25) in 2012 ( p < 0.001). Gastrostomy with and without fundoplication increased during the study period ( p < 0.001 in both groups). VLBW survival also increased from 78.5 % in 2000 to 81.1 % in 2012 ( p < 0.001). In all study years , the Northeast census region had the lowest GT rates , while the West<disease> had the highest rates in 4 of the 5 study years. Between 2000 and 2012 , the incidence of GT in VLBW infants doubled , associated with improvements in survival in this population.
