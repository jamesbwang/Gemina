 Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3) is constitutively activated in psoriatic skin<symptom> inflammation<symptom> and acts as a key player in the pathogenesis and progression of this autoimmune disease. Although numerous inhibitors that intervene in STAT3-associated pathways have been tested , an effective , highly specific inhibitor of STAT3 has yet to be identified. Here , we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo biological activity and therapeutic efficacy of a high-affinity peptide specific for STAT3 ( APTstat3) after topical treatment via intradermal and transcutaneous delivery. Using a preclinical model of psoriasis , we show that intradermal injection of APTstat3 tagged with a 9-arginine cell-penetrating peptide ( APTstat3-9R) reduced disease progression and modulated psoriasis-related cytokine signaling through inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation. Furthermore , by complexing APTstat3-9R with specific lipid formulations led to formation of discoidal lipid nanoparticles ( DLNPs) , we were able to achieve efficient skin penetration of the STAT3-inhibiting peptide after transcutaneous administration , thereby effectively inhibiting psoriatic skin<symptom> inflammation<symptom>. Collectively , these findings suggest that DLNP-assisted transcutaneous delivery of a STAT3-inhibiting peptide could be a promising strategy for treating psoriatic skin<symptom> inflammation<symptom> without causing adverse systemic events. Moreover , the DLNP system could be used for transdermal delivery of other therapeutic peptides.
