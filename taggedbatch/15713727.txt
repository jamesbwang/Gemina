 To describe self-reported medication patterns and fertility rates in a population of anabolic steroid ( AS) users. We reviewed data from an online survey of AS users and identified a sub-group who had attempted to achieve a pregnancy with their partners while using AS. The online survey consisted of questions addressing demographics , AS use , ancillary medications , and fertility outcomes. A total of 97 men ( of 231 total respondents) had attempted to achieve a pregnancy while taking AS and comprise the current cohort. The majority of men were 25-44 years old ( 63.9 %) , married ( 75.5 %) and Caucasian ( 88.7 %). Ancillary drug use was common with only 5.2 % denying drug use other than ASs. The most common reported ancillary drugs were antiestrogens ( 89.7 %) and sexual enhancement medications ( SEMs) ( 68 %). The fertility rate was 92.8 % , with 82.4 % achieving pregnancy within one year. Interestingly , only 13.5 % sought fertility evaluation with treatment required in 8.3 %. Age at initiation of AS use , maximum dosage utilized , yearly duration of supplementation , and number of years using steroids were not associated with a prolonged duration to pregnancy or decreased rate of pregnancy. Despite continued use of ASs , this cohort 's self-reported fertility rates are unexpectedly high. This is presumably related to cycling of therapy and concomitant use of fertility preserving medications.
