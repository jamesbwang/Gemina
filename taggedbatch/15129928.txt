 Ischemic stroke ( IS) is the main cause of mortality and disability in China; thus , this study aimed to examine the association between six variants and their haplotypes within the transferrin ( TF) gene and the risk of IS in the Southern Chinese Han population. Genotyping was performed using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform for 249 IS patients and 249 age- and sex-matched controls. The association between polymorphisms and IS risk was tested by Chi squared test and haplotype and stratification analysis. Odds ratios ( ORs) and confidence intervals ( CIs) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression analysis. The results of genetic model analyses indicated that the two SNPs ( rs1880669 and rs2692695) were associated with decreased IS risk under the co-dominant , dominant , and additive models. Additionally , rs4525863 was also associated with decreased IS risk both under the dominant and additive models in males. Moreover , the CG haplotype of TF ( rs1880669 and rs2692695) was significantly associated with a decreased risk of IS in the total population and males. Our findings suggested that polymorphisms ( rs4525863 , rs1880669 , and rs2692695) of the TF gene might be a protective factor for IS in Southern Chinese Han population. Further large prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.
