 The mammalian intervertebral disc ( IVD) consists of a gel-like , disordered nucleus pulposus ( NP) surrounded by a highly ordered collagen structure called annulus fibrosus ( AF). While this concentric array of lamellae is amply studied , its physical origin is poorly understood. The notochord is a rod-like organ located in the mid-line of the growing embryo and plays an essential role in IVD development. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of notochord development on the collagen fiber arrangement evolution in the AF. To that end , we studied the IVD development in mouse embryos and compared that to chicken embryos , which do not form the typical laminar structure around the NP. In the mouse , cross-aligned collagen arrangement of the AF forms from the sclerotome upon bulging of the notochord to become NP. By contrast , the notochord in the chick embryo swells substantially without the physical restrictions of the future vertebrae and thus do not bulge. We conclude that physical and geometrical constrictions are essential for the formation of the highly structured AF.
