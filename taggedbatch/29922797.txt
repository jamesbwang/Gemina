 The mobility and toxicity of chromium ( Cr) in soil and water systems are largely controlled by its oxidation state and interactions with solid phases. Relative to abiotic minerals , biogenic iron ( Fe) ( oxyhydr) oxides ( BIOS) may enhance Cr ( vi) adsorption and reduction due to their poorly ordered structures , large surface areas , and incorporation of cell derived organic matter. To determine the extent and mechanisms of the reaction between Cr ( vi) and BIOS , sorption isotherm and kinetic studies were conducted using two-line ferrihydrite , BIOS , and BIOS amended with 0.135 M ferrozine ( an Fe ( ii) chelator). X-ray absorption near edge structure ( XANES) spectroscopy of BIOS reacted with Cr ( vi) showed approximately 50 % reduction of the total sorbed Cr from Cr ( vi) to Cr ( iii) after 14 days of exposure. Sorbed Cr ( iii) was best fit with an organic carboxylate complex after 1 d of reaction , but after 7 d mineral-associated Cr ( iii) was the predominant form. In the presence of ferrozine , Cr ( vi) reduction by BIOS was inhibited , confirming a key role for Fe ( ii) as the Cr ( vi) reductant. However , the lack of a 3: 1 reaction stoichiometry between Fe ( ii) and Cr ( iii) produced suggests roles for reaction with organic matter and Cr ( v) autoreduction in Cr ( iii) production. This study thus elucidates an unrecognized mechanism of Cr sequestration by ubiquitous natural Fe ( oxyhydr) oxide deposits. Furthermore , the redox transformation of mobile Cr ( vi) to less soluble Cr ( iii) species observed in our study implies that biogenic Fe ( oxyhydr) oxides in soils and natural waters may naturally attenuate Cr ( vi) concentrations through sorption and reduction processes , thus limiting its transport to downstream environments.
