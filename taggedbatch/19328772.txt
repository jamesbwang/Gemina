 The aberrant aggregation of α-synuclein is associated with several human<disease> diseases<disease> , collectively termed the α-synucleinopathies , which includes Parkinson 's disease. The progression of these diseases is , in part , mediated by extracellular α-synuclein oligomers that may exert effects through several mechanisms , including prion-like transfer , direct cytotoxicity , and pro-inflammatory actions. In this study , we show that two abundant extracellular chaperones , clusterin and α
