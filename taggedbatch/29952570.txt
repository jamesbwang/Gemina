 Since the first application of frontier molecular orbitals ( FMOs) to rationalize stereospecificity of pericyclic reactions , FMOs have remained at the forefront of chemical theory. Yet , the practical application of FMOs in the rational design and synthesis of novel charge transfer materials remains under-appreciated. In this Perspective , we demonstrate that molecular orbital theory is a powerful and universal tool capable of rationalizing the observed redox/optoelectronic properties of various aromatic hydrocarbons in the context of their application as charge-transfer materials. Importantly , the inspection of FMOs can provide instantaneous insight into the interchromophoric electronic coupling and polaron delocalization in polychromophoric assemblies , and therefore is invaluable for the rational design and synthesis of novel materials with tailored properties.
