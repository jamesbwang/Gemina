 Breast cancer progression results from the acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations that promote tumor cell proliferation and survival. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 6 ( PCSK6) is a proteinase that regulates the proteolytic activity of various precursor proteins as well as protein maturation. PCSK6 also influences cancer cell proliferation , invasion and migration. Therefore , to investigate the effects of PCSK6 in breast cancer , human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with recombinant human PCSK6
