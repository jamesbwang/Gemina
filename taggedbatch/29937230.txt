 Polyphenols are important molecules in living organisms , particularly in plants , where they serve as protectants against predators. They are also of fundamental importance in pharmacology for their antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Since a few years polyphenols are also used in surface functionalization mimicking the tannin deposition observed when tea or red wine are in contact with the surface of cups or glasses respectively. The interaction of polyphenols with proteins to yield colloids and of polyphenol with surfaces will be reviewed in this article to provide an overview of such particles and surface functionalization methods in modern surface science. Particular emphasis will be given to biological applications of polyphenols at interfaces.
