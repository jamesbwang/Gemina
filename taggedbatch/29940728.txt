 Ferroptosis is an iron-mediated , caspase-independent pathway of cell death that is accompanied with the accumulations of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) and oxygenases , as well as being involved in many other pathophysiological procedures. However , specific and rapid monitoring of ferroptosis in living cells or tissues has not been achieved so far. Herein , a quinoxalinone-based fluorescent probe ( termed as Quinos-4 , or QS-4) with a reactive aromatic thioether moiety was designed for ferroptosis identification. Upon exposing it to high levels of ROS and hemeoxygenase-1 ( HO-1) , which are considered as the biochemical characteristics of ferroptosis , QS-4 could be oxidized into a sulfoxide derivative ( QSO-4) and its original aggregation-induced enhanced red fluorescence emission could be converted to green fluorescence emission sharply. On the basis of this unique reaction-induced color conversion , this molecular probe can be employed for identifying the occurrence of ferroptosis both in vitro and in vivo.
