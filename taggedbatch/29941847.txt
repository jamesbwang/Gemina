 In this work , we propose an electrochemical DNA aptasensor for the detection of profenofos , an organophosphorus pesticide , based on a competitive format and disposable graphite screen-printed electrodes ( GSPEs). A thiol-tethered DNA capture probe , which results to be complementary to the chosen aptamer sequence , was immobilised on gold nanoparticles/polyaniline composite film-modified electrodes ( AuNPs/PANI/GSPE). Different profenofos solutions containing a fixed amount of the biotinylated DNA aptamer were dropped onto the realized aptasensors. The hybridisation reaction was measured using a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase enzyme conjugate , which catalyses the hydrolysis of 1-naphthyl- phosphate. The 1-naphtol enzymatic product was detected by means of differential pulse voltammetry ( DPV). The aptasensor showed itself to work as a signal off sensor , according to the competitive format used. A dose response curve was obtained between 0.10 & mu; M and 10 & mu; M with a detection limit of 0.27 & mu; M.
