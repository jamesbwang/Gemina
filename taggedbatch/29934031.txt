 Complete bladder duplication is a male predominant rare congenital malformation usually diagnosed at birth. Owing to the rarity of this anomaly , only few reports have discussed the surgical approach for this condition , with the open approach for excision being the most common. We hereby present a video of a laparoscopic resection of complete bladder and urethral duplication in a 1-year-old male. The patient presented to our clinic with a red mucosal tissue protruding from a cutaneous opening at the dorsal base of the penis that has been present from birth. A normally located and functioning bladder and urethra were present. During work-up , a cystic mass located above the bladder was discovered in imaging examinations. No other anomalies were found. After a shared decision process , we performed a laparoscopic transperitoneal bladder duplication excision during which the accessory urethra and duplicated bladder were removed with preservation of the adjacent normal urethra. The patient had an uneventful recovery with excellent cosmetic results. The minimally invasive approach can be utilized for treatment of complex urinary anomalies in young children.
