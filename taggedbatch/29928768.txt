 The intensity of physical activity which can be tolerated after lung transplantation and the tolerance to prolonged exercise at high altitude are poorly investigated. Lung ultrasound comet tails have been used in the diagnosis of interstitial pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> and high pulmonary altitude edema<symptom>. The aim was to assess the number of lung ultrasound comet tails and to monitor changes in the optic nerve sheath diameter ( ONSD) during a climb to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro in 10 lung transplant recipients and 10 healthy controls at three different altitude levels: 1360 , 3505 , 4900 m. Lung transplant recipients showed a constant increase in comet tail scores with altitude , whereas control subjects only showed an increase at the highest measurement point. Differences between groups ( transplant versus control) reached significance only after the first ascend: 0.9 ( 95 % CI: -0.41; 2.21) vs. 0.1 ( 95 % CI: -0.12; 0.32) ( P = 0.2; 1360 m) , 2.33 ( 95 % CI: 0.64; 4.02) vs. 0.3 ( 95 % CI: -0.18; 0.78) ( P = 0.04; 3505 m) , and 4.11 ( 95 % CI: 0.13; 0.34) vs. 2.9 ( 95 % CI: 0.49; 5.31) ( P = 0.15; 4900 m); ONSD increased significantly in both groups from 3.53 ( 95 % CI: 0.34; 0.66) at 1360 m to 4.11 ( 95 % CI: 0.36; 0.71) at 4900 m ( P < 0.05). Lungs of transplant recipients are able to adapt to altitude and capable of performing prolonged exercise at high altitude after slow ascend.
