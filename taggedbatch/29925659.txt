 Coronaviruses pose serious health threats to humans and other animals. Understanding the mechanisms of their replication has important implications for global health and economic stability. Nonstructural protein 9 ( nsp9) is an essential RNA binding protein for coronavirus<pathogen> replication. However , the mechanisms of the dimerization and nucleic acid binding of nsp9 remain elusive. Here , we report four crystal structures , including wild-type porcine delta coronavirus<pathogen> ( PDCoV) nsp9 , PDCoV nsp9-ΔN7 ( N-terminal 7 amino acids deleted) , wild-type porcine epidemic diarrhea<disease><symptom> virus ( PEDV) nsp9 , and PEDV nsp9-C59A mutant. These structures reveal the diverse dimerization forms of coronavirus<pathogen> nsp9. We first find that the N-finger of nsp9 from PDCoV plays a critical role in dimerization. Meanwhile , PEDV nsp9 is distinguished by the presence of a disulfide bond in the dimer interface. Interestingly , size-exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses indicate that the PDCoV nsp9-ΔN7 and PEDV nsp9-C59A mutants are monomeric in solution. In addition , electrophoretic mobility shift assays and microscale thermophoresis analysis indicate that the monomeric forms of PDCoV nsp9 and PEDV nsp9 still have nucleic acid binding affinity , but it is lower than that of the wild type. Our results show that the diverse dimerization forms of coronavirus<pathogen> nsp9 proteins enhance their nucleic acid binding affinity.
