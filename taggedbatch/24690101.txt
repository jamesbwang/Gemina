 Early integration of palliative home care ( PHC) might positively affect people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). However , PHC as a holistic approach is not well integrated in clinical practice at the end-stage COPD. General practitioners ( GPs) and community nurses ( CNs) are highly involved in primary and home care and could provide valuable perspectives about barriers to and facilitators for early integrated PHC in end-stage COPD. Three focus groups were organised with GPs ( n = 28) and four with CNs ( n = 28) , transcribed verbatim and comparatively analysed. Barriers were related to the unpredictability of COPD , a lack of disease insight and resistance towards care of the patient , lack of cooperation and experience with PHC for professional caregivers , lack of education about early integrated PHC , insufficient continuity of care from hospital to home , and lack of communication about PHC between professional caregivers and with end-stage COPD patients. Facilitators were the use of trigger moments for early integrating PHC , such as after a hospital admission or when an end-stage COPD patient becomes oxygen-dependent or housebound , positive attitudes towards PHC in informal caregivers , more focus on early integration of PHC in professional caregivers ' education , implementing advance care planning in healthcare and PHC systems , and enhancing communication about care and PHC. The results provide insights for clinical practice and the development of key components for successful practice in a phase 0-2 Early Integration of PHC for end-stage COPD ( EPIC) trial , such as improving care integration , patients ' disease insight and training PHC nurses in care for end-stage COPD.
