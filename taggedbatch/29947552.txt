 The prelimbic cortex ( PrL) as a part of the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC) plays a crucial role in drug addiction. Previous studies have shown that glutamatergic transmission through the NMDA and AMPA receptors plays an important role in morphine rewarding properties. In this study , we evaluated the effect of glutamate receptors blockade within the PrL on morphine self-administration. Male Wistar rats were randomly selected and divided into 7 groups. Trained rats were placed in self-administration apparatus , where they pressed an active lever for receiving morphine ( 5 mg/mL) in test groups and saline in saline group during 11 consecutive days for 2 h per session. The effects of intra-prelimbic AMPA receptor antagonist ( CNQX; 0.5 and 2.5 μg/0 .5 μL) and the NMDA antagonist ( AP5; 0.1 and 1 μg/0 .5 μL) on self-administration were tested. Our results demonstrated that intra-prelimbic injection of different doses of CNQX and AP5 , and co-administration of these 2 drugs before self-administration significantly decreased active lever pressing compared with morphine group ( p < 0.001). Also , the number of self-infusion significantly decreased in test groups compared with morphine group ( p < 0.001). These findings suggest that a reduction in PrL glutamatergic output can modulate morphine reinforcement.
