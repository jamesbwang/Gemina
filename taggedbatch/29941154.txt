 Ocean sprawl is replacing natural substrates with artificial alternatives. We hypothesized that , after submersion , high occupancy , high mobility species colonize artificial substrates faster than low occupancy , low mobility species , a biodiversity divergence that will slowly fade out with time. Using quantitative visual census of species in 10 artificial and their adjacent natural substrates , we tested for the existence and temporal evolution of this divergence. Assigning species to one of three occupancy and one of three mobility categories , we found that artificial substrates increased the performance of high mobility , high occupancy species while decreased the performance of low occupancy species with medium and low mobility. This biodiversity divergence remained unchanged over the 50-year underwater timespan of the artificial substrates investigated. Our results suggest that proliferation of artificial substrates is building up a biodiversity loss driven by the least conspicuous and uncommon benthic and sessile species that is undermining coastal marine biodiversity.
