 Renal<symptom> involvement<symptom> is occasionally observed in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome<disease><symptom> ( WAS) and X-linked thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( XLT). It has been reported that galactose-deficient IgA is a closely linked to IgA nephropathy ( IgAN) , suggesting that patients with XLT/WAS associated with reduced galactosylation on serum IgA are susceptible to IgAN. It is necessary to pay more attention to patients with IgAN due to the potential complication with XLT/WAS. We here present a patient of XLT complicated with mild IgAN who underwent tonsillectomy combined with steroid pulse therapy to achieve complete clinical remission.
