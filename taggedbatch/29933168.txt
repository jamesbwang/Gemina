 Ozonation of pyridine and indole was investigated both in aqueous solution and biologically pretreated coal gasification wastewater ( BPCGW). Experimental results showed that the removal of indole was hardly affected by pH value. Direct reaction rate constant of ozone with pyridine increased from 0.18 M
