 IT127 is a dinuclear transition metal complex that contains a Pt ( ii) and a Ru ( iii) metal center. We have shown that IT127 is significantly more effective in binding the 29-base sarcin ricin<pathogen><disease> loop ( SRL) RNA in comparison to Cisplatin , a hallmark anticancer agent. Binding site analysis shows that IT127 prefers purine bases and the GAGA tetraloop region of SRL RNA. Our results with a dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR) model system reveal that IT127 binding to mRNA reduces translation of DHFR enzyme and that the Ru ( iii) and Pt ( ii) centers in IT127 appear to work in a synergistic manner.
