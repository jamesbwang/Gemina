 Although experiences with ecological restoration continue to accumulate , the effectiveness of restoration for biota remains debated. We complemented a traditional taxonomic analysis approach with information on 56 species traits to uncover the responses of three aquatic ( fish , macroinvertebrates , macrophytes) and two terrestrial ( carabid beetles , floodplain vegetation) biotic groups to 43 hydromorphological river restoration projects in Germany. All taxonomic groups responded positively to restoration , as shown by increased taxonomic richness ( 10-164 %) and trait diversity ( 15-120 %). Responses , however , were stronger for terrestrial than aquatic biota and , contrary to our expectation , taxonomic responses were stronger than those of traits. Nevertheless , trait analysis provided mechanistic insights into the drivers of community change following restoration. Trait analysis for terrestrial biota indicated that the pathway by which restoration succeeded was likely by enhancing lateral connectivity and re-establishing dynamic processes in the floodplain. The weaker response of aquatic biota suggests that recovery was hindered by the persistence of stressors in the aquatic environment , such as degraded water quality , dispersal constraints and insufficient hydromorphological change. Therefore , river restoration requires combined local- and regional-scale approaches to maximize the response of both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Due to the contrasting responses of aquatic and terrestrial biota , the planning and assessment of river restoration outcomes should consider effects on both components of riverine landscapes.
