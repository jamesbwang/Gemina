 To assess the implementation of radiation dose monitoring software , create a process for clinical follow-up and documentation of high-dose cases , and quantify the number of patient reported radiation-induced tissue reactions in fluoroscopically guided interventional radiology ( IR) and neuro-interventional radiology ( NIR) procedures. Web-based radiation dose monitoring software was installed at our institution and a process to flag all procedures with reference point air kerma ( K Three thousand five hundred eighty-two procedures were performed over the 1-year period. The software successfully transferred dose data on 3363 ( 93.9 %) procedures. One thousand three hundred ninety-three ( 368 IR and 1025 NIR) procedures were further analyzed after excluding 2189 IR procedures with K Software monitoring and documentation of radiation dose in interventional procedures can be successfully implemented. Radiation-induced tissue reactions are relatively uncommon.
