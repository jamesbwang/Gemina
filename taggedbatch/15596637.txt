 There are no guidelines for transitioning patients from chronic kidney disease stage 5 to hemodialysis. We conducted this study to determine if there are uniform patterns in how nephrologists transition patients to dialysis. We designed an electronic survey with 39 questions and sent it to a database of practicing nephrologists at the National Kidney Foundation. Factors that were important for transitioning a patient to hemodialysis were evaluated , including medication changes on dialysis initiation , dry<symptom> weight and dialysis prescription. 160 US Nephrologists replied to the survey; 18 % ( 29/160) of the responses were completed via social media sites. Prior to dialysis , 74 % ( 118/160) , prescribed furosemide and 67 % ( 107/160) used furosemide with metolazone. Once dialysis started , only 46 % ( 74/160) of the responders continued patients on diuretics daily. Hypertension medications prescribed in dialysis were calcium channel blockers 69 % ( 112/160) , beta blockers 36 % ( 58/160) , angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor 32 % ( 53/160) , angiotensin receptor blocker 29 % ( 46/160) and diuretics 25 % ( 42/160). Once dialysis started , 68 % ( 109/160) routinely changed medications. Most , 67 % ( 107/160) ordered patients to avoid anti-hypertensive medications on dialysis days to allow for ultrafiltration. Dry<symptom> weight was determined in the first week by 29 % ( 46/160) and in the first month by 53 % ( 85/160). Most , 59 % ( 94/160) felt that multiple causes lead to hypertension. Most nephrologists would prescribe small dialyzers and a shorter period of time for the first dialysis session. The transition period to chronic hemodialysis has variations in practice patterns and may benefit from further studies to optimize clinical practice.
