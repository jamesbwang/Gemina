 Despite international guidelines recommending termination of resuscitation ( TOR<pathogen>) rules for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA) , their implementation remains low. We aimed to develop and validate a new TOR<pathogen> rule that could allow emergency medical service ( EMS) personnel to immediately and objectively decide whether to withhold further resuscitation attempts after their arrival. This observational study evaluated data from OHCA cases in a prospectively collected nationwide Utstein-style Japanese database ( 2008-2012). Patients were divided into a development cohort ( 2008-2010 , n = 342,055) and a validation cohort ( 2011-2012 , n = 247,283). A new TOR<pathogen> was developed based on multivariable logistic regression analysis of factors that were associated with unfavourable neurological outcomes. Validation was performed based on specificity , the positive predictive value ( PPV) , and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC). Three factors were strongly associated with unfavourable neurological outcomes at one month after OHCA: unshockable initial rhythm ( adjusted odds ratio ( aOR): 6.09 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 5.81-6.38) , unwitnessed by bystanders ( aOR: 5.27 , 95 % CI: 4.99-5.57) , and age of ≥ 73 years ( adjusted OR: 2.34 , 95 % CI: 2.24-2.45). In the validation cohort , the new TOR<pathogen> rule provided specificity of 0.955 ( 95 % CI: 0.950-0.959) , a PPV of 0.996 ( 95 % CI: 0.996-0.997) , and an AUC of 0.828 ( 95 % CI: 0.824-0.833). Based on three objective variables: unshockable initial rhythm , unwitnessed by bystanders , and age ≥ 73 years , which can be collected immediately after the arrival of EMS personnel at the scene , a new TOR<pathogen> can be developed. Our potential new TOR<pathogen> rule provided an excellent PPV ( > 99 %) for unfavourable neurological outcomes at one month after OHCA.
