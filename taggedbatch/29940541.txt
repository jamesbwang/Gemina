 Traffic accidents cause 1.25 million deaths per year worldwide , being one of the leading causes of death in young people , and the first cause between the ages of 15- 29. There has been an increase in accidents in the last 10 years , one of the reasons for this is the increase in the sales of motorcycles and its use. We present a retrospective study about the patients who received attention at Carlos G. Durand Hospital , ( CABA , Buenos Aires , Argentina) from January 2013 to December of 2015 , with the intention of showing the medical and economic impact this accidents cause. Of a total of 4368 incoming patients assisted , due to traffic accidents , 67 % ( 2926) were the result of motorcycle crashes; 18 % of them required hospitalization. Males , and lower limbs<symptom> lesions<symptom> were predominant. Hospitalizations varied between 5 and 150 days , with 2.1 average surgeries per patient. The total cost was 16 767 037 $ , and in 2014 it represented 17 936 US$ per patient. These results show only partially the impact these accidents produce , because there are factors ( like missing working days) that were unaccounted for. This is why it is necessary to generate awareness and develop more rigorous road safety and prevention policies , necessary to avoid accidents that increase spending on preventable conditions.
