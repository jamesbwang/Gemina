 Stool<symptom> microscopy and concentration techniques are the two most important and necessary aspects of diagnostic parasitology. In an era when there is increased disease burden due to intestinal parasites , an early and appropriate diagnosis is warranted. Direct microscopy is usually labor intensive and tedious. Thirty-two fresh fecal specimens from patients presenting with eosinophilia and/or anemia<symptom> ( hemoglobin levels < 10 g %) , HIV-positive patients , and in patients clinically suspected of harboring parasites , were collected for the study. All the positive samples were processed by both the standard methodology , i.e. , formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation technique and Mini<pathogen> Parasep The morphology of eggs was maintained in both the techniques; however , the wet mount prepared from the sedimentation technique had more background fecal debris in comparison to the Parasep We found that Parasep
