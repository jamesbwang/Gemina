 This study investigateed the influence of complete denture on oral bacteria flora. Bateria plaque samples in oral mucosa , saliva and denture surfaces in 11 edentulous patients were collected , then the 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed. Pyrosequencing was used to analyze the 16S rRNA gene V3 ~ V4 regions , oral bacteria flora were classified and identified. There were 64800 sequences in complete denture-wearing subjects , Streptococcus<pathogen> mitis<pathogen> , Gemella<pathogen> haemolysans<pathogen> , Rothia<pathogen> mucilaginosa<pathogen> , Porphyromonas<pathogen> sp , Neisseria<pathogen> zoodegmatis<pathogen> , Granulicatella<pathogen> elegans<pathogen> , Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> , Pseudomonas<pathogen> citrinum<pathogen> , Granulicatella<pathogen><pathogen> adiacens<pathogen> and Fusobacterium<pathogen> canifelinum were the predominant species ( 37416 sequences). The species of denture tissue surface were similar to these of buccal vestibule after wearing denture , and the species of denture smooth surface were similar to these of tongue ventrum and the floor of mouth<symptom>. The effect of complete denture on oral flora is still limited , and the composition of oral flora is influenced by many other factors.
