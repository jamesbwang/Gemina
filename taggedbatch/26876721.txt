 Postoperative pancreatic fistula<disease> is one of the most frequent and potentially life-threatening complications following pancreatic resections. Fibrin sealants are introduced to reduce postoperative pancreatic fistula<disease> by some surgeons. However , the use of fibrin sealants during pancreatic surgery is controversial. This is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2016. To assess the safety , effectiveness , and potential adverse effects of fibrin sealants for the prevention of postoperative pancreatic fistula<disease> following pancreatic surgery. We searched trial registers and the following biomedical databases: the Cochrane Library ( 2018 , Issue 4) , MEDLINE ( 1946 to 12 April 2018) , Embase ( 1980 to 12 April 2018) , Science Citation Index Expanded ( 1900 to 12 April 2018) , and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database ( CBM) ( 1978 to 12 April 2018). We included all randomized controlled trials that compared fibrin sealant ( fibrin glue or fibrin sealant patch) versus control ( no fibrin sealant or placebo) in people undergoing pancreatic surgery. Two review authors independently identified the trials for inclusion , collected the data , and assessed the risk of bias. We performed the meta-analyses using Review Manager 5. We calculated the risk ratio ( RR) for dichotomous outcomes ( or a Peto odds ratio ( OR) for very rare outcomes) , and the mean difference ( MD) for continuous outcomes , with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). We included 11 studies involving 1462 participants in the review.Application of fibrin sealants to pancreatic stump closure reinforcement after distal pancreatectomyWe included seven studies involving 860 participants: 428 were randomized to the fibrin sealant group and 432 to the control group after distal pancreatectomy. Fibrin sealants may lead to little or no difference in postoperative pancreatic fistula<disease> ( fibrin sealant 19.3 %; control 20.1 %; RR 0.96 , 95 % CI 0.68 to 1.35; 755 participants; four studies; low-quality evidence). Fibrin sealants may also lead to little or no difference in postoperative mortality ( 0.3 % versus 0.5 %; Peto OR 0.52 , 95 % CI 0.05 to 5.03; 804 participants; six studies; low-quality evidence) , or overall postoperative morbidity ( 28.5 % versus 23.2 %; RR 1.23 , 95 % CI 0.97 to 1.58; 646 participants; three studies; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether fibrin sealants reduce reoperation rate ( 2.0 % versus 3.8 %; RR 0.51 , 95 % CI 0.15 to 1.71; 376 participants; two studies; very low-quality evidence). There is probably little or no difference in length of hospital stay between the groups ( 12.1 days versus 11.4 days; MD 0.32 days , 95 % CI -1.06 to 1.70; 755 participants; four studies; moderate-quality evidence). The studies did not report serious adverse events , quality of life , or cost effectiveness.Application of fibrin sealants to pancreatic anastomosis reinforcement after pancreaticoduodenectomyWe included three studies involving 251 participants: 115 were randomized to the fibrin sealant group and 136 to the control group after pancreaticoduodenectomy. We are uncertain whether fibrin sealants reduce postoperative pancreatic fistula<disease> ( 1.6 % versus 6.2 %; RR 0.25 , 95 % CI 0.01 to 5.06; 57 participants; one study; very low-quality evidence). Fibrin sealants may lead to little or no difference in postoperative mortality ( 0.1 % versus 0.7 %; Peto OR 0.15 , 95 % CI 0.00 to 7.76; 251 participants; three studies; low-quality evidence) or length of hospital stay ( 12.8 days versus 14.8 days; MD -1.58 days , 95 % CI -3.96 to 0.81; 181 participants; two studies; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether fibrin sealants reduce overall postoperative morbidity ( 33.7 % versus 34.7 %; RR 0.97 , 95 % CI 0.65 to 1.45; 181 participants; two studies; very low-quality evidence) , or reoperation rate ( 7.6 % versus 9.2 %; RR 0.83 , 95 % CI 0.33 to 2.11; 181 participants; two studies , very low-quality evidence). The studies did not report serious adverse events , quality of life , or cost effectiveness.Application of fibrin sealants to pancreatic duct occlusion after pancreaticoduodenectomyWe included two studies involving 351 participants: 188 were randomized to the fibrin sealant group and 163 to the control group after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Fibrin sealants may lead to little or no difference in postoperative mortality ( 8.4 % versus 6.1 %; Peto OR 1.41 , 95 % CI 0.63 to 3.13; 351 participants; two studies; low-quality evidence) or length of hospital stay ( 17.0 days versus 16.5 days; MD 0.58 days , 95 % CI -5.74 to 6.89; 351 participants; two studies; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether fibrin sealants reduce overall postoperative morbidity ( 32.0 % versus 27.6 %; RR 1.16 , 95 % CI 0.67 to 2.02; 351 participants; two studies; very low-quality evidence) , or reoperation rate ( 13.6 % versus 16.0 %; RR 0.85 , 95 % CI 0.52 to 1.41; 351 participants; two studies; very low-quality evidence). Serious adverse events were reported in one study: more participants developed diabetes mellitus when fibrin sealants were applied to pancreatic duct occlusion , both at three months ' follow-up ( 33.7 % fibrin sealant group versus 10.8 % control group; 29 participants versus 9 participants) and 12 months ' follow-up ( 33.7 % fibrin sealant group versus 14.5 % control group; 29 participants versus 12 participants). The studies did not report postoperative pancreatic fistula<disease> , quality of life , or cost effectiveness. Based on the current available evidence , fibrin sealants may have little or no effect on postoperative pancreatic fistula<disease> in people undergoing distal pancreatectomy. The effects of fibrin sealants on the prevention of postoperative pancreatic fistula<disease> are uncertain in people undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.
