 Personalization of the treatment of brain metastases considering patient 's overall survival ( OS) prognosis is gaining importance. This study was conducted to develop an OS score particularly for patients receiving local therapies for single brain metastasis from gynecological malignancies. In 11 patients , the following factors were retrospectively analyzed for associations with OS: Age , Karnofsky performance score ( KPS) , tumor type , extra-cranial metastatic sites , and time from diagnosis of gynecological malignancy to treatment of brain metastasis. Factors showing at least a strong trend were used for the score. A KPS of 80-90 % resulted in a significantly better OS than a KPS of 50-70 % ( p = 0.008). Absence of extra-cranial metastases showed a strong trend ( p = 0.052). For the score , the following points were used: KPS 50-70 % = 0 , KPS 80-90 % = 1 , presence of extra-cranial metastatic sites = 0 , absence = 1. Patients ' scores were 0 , 1 or 2 points. OS rates at both 6 and 12 months were 0 % , 67 % and 100 % , respectively ( p = 0.020). This specific score can be used to estimate OS in patients receiving local therapies for single brain metastasis from gynecological malignancies and personalize their care.
