 The intestinal disease shigellosis<disease> caused by Shigella<pathogen> bacteria affects over 120 million people annually. There is an urgent demand for new drugs as resistance against common antibiotics emerges. Bacterial tRNA-guanine transglycosylase ( TGT) is a druggable target and controls the pathogenicity of Shigella<pathogen> flexneri<pathogen>. We report the synthesis of sugar-functionalized lin-benzoguanines addressing the ribose-33 pocket of TGT from Zymomonas mobilis. Ligand binding was analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry and X-ray crystallography. Pocket occupancy was optimized by variation of size and protective groups of the sugars. The participation of a polycyclic water-cluster in the recognition of the sugar moiety was revealed. Acetonide-protected ribo- and psicofuranosyl derivatives are highly potent , benefiting from structural rigidity , good solubility , and metabolic stability. We conclude that sugar acetonides have a significant but not yet broadly recognized value in drug development.
