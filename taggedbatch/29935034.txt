 Microorganisms execute an enthralling range of adjustments in order to survive in the host. Among the various strategies employed by microorganisms to surmount the host immune response , the phenomenon of molecular mimicry empowers the microorganisms to manoeuvre host physiology and cellular functions for their own advantage by mimicking the host proteins and initiating autoimmunity. This phenomena , by and large , has been studied in context of autoimmune diseases , however , its implications have also been reported in infertility<symptom>. Hence , in this article , we provide a review of the various instances of molecular mimicry initiated by bacteria , parasites and viruses in the world of autoimmune diseases and infertility<symptom>.
