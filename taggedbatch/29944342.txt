 The presence of micro- and nanoplastics in the marine environment is raising strong concerns since they can possibly have a negative impact on human health. In particular , the lack of appropriate methodologies to collect the nanoplastics from water systems imposes the use of engineered model nanoparticles to explore their interactions with biological systems , with results not easily correlated with the real case conditions. In this work , we propose a reliable top-down approach based on laser ablation of polymers to form polyethylene terephthalate ( PET) nanoplastics , which mimic real environmental nanopollutants , unlike synthetic samples obtained by colloidal chemistry. PET nanoparticles were carefully characterized in terms of chemical/physical properties and stability in different media. The nanoplastics have a ca. 100 nm average dimension , with significant size and shape heterogeneity , and they present weak acid groups on their surface , similarly to photodegraded PET plastics. Despite no toxic effects emerging by in vitro studies on human Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells , the formed nanoplastics were largely internalized in endolysosomes , showing intracellular biopersistence and long-term stability in a simulated lysosomal environment. Interestingly , when tested on a model of intestinal epithelium , nano-PET showed high propensity to cross the gut barrier , with unpredictable long-term effects on health and potential transport of dispersed chemicals mediated by the nanopollutants.
