 Cutaneous manifestations can be found in many patients with hematologic disorders , including thalassemia. Patients with beta-thalassemia major attending the pediatric department of Fayoum University Hospital from April 2016 to October 2016 ( n = 100) were compared with controls ( n = 100). Both groups underwent detailed history evaluation , clinical examination , and laboratory investigations , including complete blood count , liver and kidney function , serum ferritin , and thyroid profile. A single dermatologist conducted a clinical dermatologic examination for all participants. Children with thalassemia had a greater prevalence of xerosis<pathogen> ( 72 %) , pruritus ( 52 %) , idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis ( 22 %) , urticaria ( 16 %) , ephelides ( freckles; 13 %) , and scars ( 13 %) than controls ( P â‰¤ .001). We detected a significant relationship between serum ferritin and pruritus , xerosis<pathogen> , ephelides , idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis , urticaria , and age of patients with thalassemia ( P < .05). Children without thyroid abnormalities were more likely to have xerosis<pathogen> , pruritus , idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis , urticaria , and ephelides ( 86 %) than controls ( P < .05). Although there was no significant difference in skin findings between patients who did and did not receive chelating agents ( P > .05) , a significant association was found between xerosis<pathogen> and the use of deferoxamine and deferiprone , whereas ephelides and urticaria were more common in patients receiving deferasirox. Because cutaneous manifestations are common in Egyptian patients with beta thalassemia major , regular dermatologic follow-up is recommended for early management.
