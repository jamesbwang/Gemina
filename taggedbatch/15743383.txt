 This study combines two well-known vascular research models , hyperoxia and hind<symptom> limb ischemia , aiming to better characterize capacities of the hyperoxia challenge. We studied two groups of C57/BL6 male mice , a control ( C) and a hind<symptom> limb ischemia ( HLI) group. Perfusion from both limbs was recorded in all animals by laser Doppler techniques under an oxygen ( O
