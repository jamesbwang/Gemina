 Reports an error in `` Prospective relations between parent-adolescent acculturation conflict and mental health symptoms among Vietnamese American adolescents '' by Diem Julie Nguyen , Joanna J. Kim , Bahr Weiss , Victoria Ngo and Anna S. Lau ( Survey measures were administered to 375 Vietnamese American adolescents ( 48.8 % males; M = 15.55 years , SD = .59) at 3 time points over 6 months. Using cross-lagged path analysis , perceived acculturation conflict predicted externalizing symptoms , whereas internalizing symptoms predicted perceived acculturation conflict. Perceived maternal psychological control mediated the association between perceived acculturation conflict and later externalizing symptoms , whereas maternal psychological control , parental unresponsiveness , and unmet parent expectations mediated the association between internalizing symptoms and later acculturation conflict. Culturally competent enhancement of parental sensitivity and responsiveness might be targeted as a modifiable protective factor in family-based preventive interventions for at-risk immigrant families.
