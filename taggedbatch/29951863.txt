 Arbuscular mycorrhizal ( AM) fungi<pathogen> can significantly contribute to plant nitrogen ( N) uptake from complex organic sources , most likely in concert with activity of soil saprotrophs and other microbes releasing and transforming the N bound in organic forms. Here , we tested whether AM fungus ( Rhizophagus irregularis<pathogen>) extraradical hyphal networks showed any preferences towards certain forms of organic N ( chitin of fungal or crustacean origin , DNA , clover biomass , or albumin) administered in spatially discrete patches , and how the presence of AM fungal hyphae affected other microbes.
