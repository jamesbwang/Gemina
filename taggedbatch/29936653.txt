 Several studies worldwide have demonstrated significant relationships between meteorological parameters and stroke events. However , authors often reported discordant effects of both barometric pressure and air temperature on stroke occurrence. The present study investigated whether there was an association between weather parameters ( barometric pressure and temperature) and ischemic stroke hospitalization. The aim of the study was to find out whether daily barometric pressure may be used as a prognostic variable to evaluate the workload change of a neurological intensive care unit. We conducted a retrospective review study in which we collected the independent ( barometric pressure and temperature) and dependent variables ( stroke hospitalization) every 24 h for the periods 10/1/2016- 4/30/2017 at Augusta University Medical Center of Augusta , GA.. We analyzed the data with zero-inflated Poisson model to assess the relationship between the barometric pressure , temperature , and daily stroke hospitalization. The results showed that there was a significantly correlation between daily barometric pressure variation and daily stroke hospitalization , especially on elder male patients ( â‰¥ 65). Stroke events were more likely to occur in the patients with risk factors than in those without risk factors when exposed to barometric pressure and temperature changes. Decreased barometric pressure and increased temperature were associated with increased daily stroke hospitalization. Furthermore , there was a potential delayed effect of increased stroke events after cold temperature exposure. Barometric pressure and temperature changes over the preceding 24 h are associated with daily stroke hospitalization. These findings may enhance our understanding of relationship between stroke and weather and maybe used in the development of public health strategies to minimize the weather-related stroke risk.
