 In most animals , the brain controls the body via a set of descending neurons ( DNs) that traverse the neck. DN activity activates , maintains or modulates locomotion and other behaviors. Individual DNs have been well-studied in species from insects to primates , but little is known about overall connectivity patterns across the DN population. We systematically investigated DN anatomy in
