 Hypokalemia is the most frequent electrolyte abnormality seen in clinical practice. Hypokalemia is defined as serum potassium below 3.5 mEq/L and is usually asymptomatic and only identified in routine laboratory analysis. However , in some cases , symptoms include hypertension , palpitations , muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> , easy fatigability , cramping and myalgias<symptom> , memory<symptom> impairment<symptom> , disorientation<symptom> and confusion<symptom> , depressed or anxious mood , and irritability<symptom>. Although rare , hypokalemia has been associated with psychosis. In particular , hypokalemia has been associated with psychotic exacerbations in patients with chronic psychotic disorder. We present a case report of a young female who developed a first presentation of acute psychosis and in which complementary investigations revealed hypokalemia. The psychosis resolved in few hours after replacement therapy with potassium chloride. The patient returned her usual functioning after discharge and there were no signs of psychosis at six-month follow-up.
