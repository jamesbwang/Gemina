 Human α- and β-enolases are highly homologous enzymes , difficult to differentiate immunologically. In this work , we describe production , purification and properties of anti-α- and anti-β-enolase polyclonal antibodies. To raise antibodies , rabbits were injected with enolase isoenzymes that were purified from human kidney ( α-enolase) and skeletal muscle ( β-enolase). Selective anti-α- and anti-β-enolase antibodies were obtained by affinity chromatography on either α- or β-enolase-Sepharose columns. On Western blots , antibodies directed against human β-enolase , did not react with human α-isoenzyme , but recognized pig and rat β-enolase. To determine what makes these antibodies selective bioinformatic tools were used to predict conformational epitopes for both enolase isoenzymes. Three predicted epitopes were mapped to the same regions in both α- and β-enolase. Peptides corresponding to predicted epitopes were synthesized and tested against purified antibodies. One of the pin-attached peptides representing α-enolase epitope ( the C-terminal portion of the epitope 3- S
