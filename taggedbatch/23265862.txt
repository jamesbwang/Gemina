 Tonsils provide an innovative in vivo model for investigating immune response to infections and allergens. However , data are scarce on the differences in tonsillar virus infections and immune responses between patients with tonsillar hypertrophy or recurrent tonsillitis<disease>. We investigated the differences in virus detection and T cell and interferon gene expression in patients undergoing tonsillectomy due to tonsillar hypertrophy or recurrent tonsillitis<disease>. Tonsils of 89 surgical patients with tonsillar hypertrophy ( n = 47) or recurrent tonsillitis<disease> ( n = 42) were analysed. Patients were carefully characterized clinically. Standard questionnaire was used to asses preceding and allergy symptoms. Respiratory<disease> viruses were analysed in tonsils and nasopharynx by PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to analyse intratonsillar gene expressions of IFN-α , IFN-β , IFN-γ , IL-10 , IL-13 , IL-17 , IL-28 , IL-29 , IL-37 , TGF-β , FOXP3 , GATA3 , RORC2 and Tbet. Median age of the subjects was 15 years ( range 2-60). Patients with tonsillar hypertrophy were younger , smoked less often , had less pollen allergy and had more adenovirus<pathogen> , bocavirus-1 , coronavirus<pathogen> and rhinovirus<pathogen> in nasopharynx ( all Intratonsillar T cell and interferon gene expressions appeared to be relatively stable for both tonsillar hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis<disease>. Of the studied cytokines , only newly discovered anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-37 , was independently associated with tonsillar hypertrophy showing slightly stronger anti-inflammatory response in these patients.
