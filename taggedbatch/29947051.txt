 Substantial progress has recently been made in optimizing the management of cancer patients , resulting in major gains in survival and quality of life. Much of this progress has resulted from the serial testing of promising treatment strategies , typically using prospective randomized controlled trials to compare outcomes achieved with the new approach versus the current standard ( s) of care. However , there is an ever-expanding list of important questions that are difficult to investigate , particularly with respect to determining the optimal sequencing and combination of proven active agents. With the rapidly growing list of clinical , pathologic and molecular characteristics that promise to predict treatment benefit and/or risk for defined patient subsets , many new questions regarding how best to personalize our approach to treatment selection are emerging. These questions can be investigated in the context of registry-based randomized clinical trials. Recently , the potential of registry-based randomized clinical trials was demonstrated in cardiology , highlighting the ability to rapidly recruit large numbers of patients to a trial addressing an important clinical question , with minimal cost and high external validity. In this review , we discuss the challenges and limitations of conventional clinical trials in multidisciplinary cancer care , describe the potential advantages of registry-based randomized trials , and highlight several registry-based oncology studies that are already underway to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.
