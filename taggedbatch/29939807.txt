 Putative protein O-fucosyltransferases ( POFTs) represent a large family of Glycosyl Transferase family 65 domain-containing proteins in land plants , with at least 39 proposed members in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome alone. We recently identified a member of this family , AtOFT1 ( At3g05320) , in which loss-of-function mutants display impaired sexual reproduction that was linked to a defective male gamete. Specifically , oft1 mutant pollen tubes are ineffective at penetrating the stigma-style interface leading to a drastic reduction in seed set and a nearly 2000-fold reduction in pollen transmission. Our findings establish that AtOFT1 plays a critical role in pollen tube penetration through the stigma/style in Arabidopsis and further suggest an important role for protein O-glycosylation events that potentially influence pollen tube mechanical strength or the ability to respond to positional guidance cues during the process of tube growth and fertilization.
