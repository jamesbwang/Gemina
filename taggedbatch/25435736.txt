 Extracellular vesicles ( EVs) in blood products are potential effectors of inflammation<symptom> and coagulation after transfusion. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of different blood manufacturing methods and duration of hypothermic storage on the EV subpopulations in relation to other in vitro quality parameters of red blood cell concentrate ( RCC) products. RCCs were produced using whole blood filtration ( WBF) or red cell filtration ( RCF) ( n = 12/method) , refrigerated for 43 days , and evaluated for EV size profile and concentration , red cell deformability , ATP and 2,3-DPG , hemolysis<symptom> , and hematological indices. The total number of EVs increased significantly with storage in both methods , and WBF-RCCs contained the higher numbers of EVs compared to RCF-RCCs. The concentration of small EVs was greater in WBF-RCCs versus RCF-RCCs , with difference between the two methods observed on day 43 of storage ( p = 0.001). Throughout storage , significant decreases were identified in ATP , 2,3-DPG , and EI The dynamic shift in the size and concentration of the EV subpopulations is dependent on the blood manufacturing method and length of storage. Better understanding of the potential clinical implications of these heterogeneous populations of EVs are needed.
