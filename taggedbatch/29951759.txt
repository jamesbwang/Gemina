 This study aimed to determine the coupled effects of temperature and urea application rate on kinetic and thermodynamic parameters to supplement the mechanism of urea hydrolysis and modify the Arrhenius model to improve the prediction accuracy of urea content. Laboratory experiments were conducted for sandy loam soil under different temperatures ( T) ( 288 , 293 , 298 , and 308 K) and urea application rates ( F) ( 247 , 309 , 371 , and 433 mg kg
