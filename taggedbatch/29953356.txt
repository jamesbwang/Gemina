 Mycochemical examination of a methanol extract of Scleroderma bovista Fr. ( Agaricomycetes) led to the isolation of 7 compounds , which were , to our knowledge , identified for the first time in this species. The chemical structures of these compounds were determined through extensive spectroscopic methods ( nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry). The fungal metabolites were identified as steroids based on ergostane ( compounds 1-4) and lanostane ( compounds 6 and 7) skeletons , whereas compound 5 was a ceramide derivative. We evaluated the antiproliferative activity of compounds 4-7 against human cancer cell lines ( HeLa , A2780 , MDA-MB-231 , and MCF-7) using the MTT assay. The lanostane-type derivatives ( compounds 6 and 7) and ergosterol peroxide 3-glucoside ( compound 4) exerted significant antiproliferative property on 1 or more human cancer cell lines.
