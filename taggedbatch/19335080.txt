 There has been increasing interest in the study of the association between Vitamin D receptor ( VDR) gene polymorphisms and risk of chronic periodontitis<disease>. However , the results remain inconclusive. To better understand the roles of VDR polymorphisms ( BsmI , TaqI , FokI , and ApaI) in chronic periodontitis<disease> susceptibility , we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis. The PubMed , Google Scholar , and Web of Science database were systemically searched to determine all the eligible studies about VDR polymorphisms and risk of chronic periodontitis<disease> up to April 2017. Odds ratio ( OR) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI) were used to evaluate the associations between VDR polymorphisms and chronic periodontitis<disease> risk. All the statistical analyses were performed by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis. All Finally , a total of 38 case-control studies in 19 publications were identified which met our inclusion criteria. There are ten studies with 866 chronic periodontitis<disease> cases and 786 controls for BsmI , 16 studies with 1570 chronic periodontitis<disease> cases and 1676 controls for TaqI , five studies with 374 chronic periodontitis<disease> cases and 382 controls for FokI , and seven studies with 632 chronic periodontitis<disease> cases and 604 controls for ApaI. Overall , no significant association was observed between VDR gene BsmI , TaqI , FokI , and ApaI polymorphisms and risk of chronic periodontitis<disease> in any genetic model. Subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity suggested a significant association between BsmI polymorphism and chronic periodontitis<disease> risk in the Caucasian subgroup under allele model ( A vs. G: OR = 1.747 , 95 % CI = 1.099-2.778 , Our results suggest that BsmI , TaqI , FokI , and ApaI polymorphisms in the VDR gene might not be associated with risk of chronic periodontitis<disease> in overall population.
