 The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of encapsulating resveratrol in ovalbumin ( OVA)- carboxymethylcellulose ( CMC) nanocomplexes or nanoparticles on its photostability and bioaccessibility. The nanocomplexes were formed by the electrostatic assembly between OVA and CMC , and the nanoparticles were fabricated through further heating the nanocomplexes at 90 °C for 30 min. The nanocomplexes and nanoparticles both presented a spherical morphology , and the nanoparticles exhibited larger average particle sizes and net zeta potential. The encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity were around 26 % and 13 μg mg-1 for OVA/CMC nanocomplexes , and evidently increased to around 70 % and 35 μg mg-1 for OVA/CMC nanoparticles , respectively. The major driving forces for resveratrol encapsulation were hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction. Both the formulations could improve the photostability of trans-resveratrol when exposed to UV light , and the nanoparticles were more effective. Moreover , the release profile of resveratrol from the nanocapsules in the in vitro simulated gastrointestinal tract was greatly enhanced and could be well fitted using the Higuchi kinetic model and Korsmeyer-Peppas model , indicating a Fickian diffusion release mechanism. Compared to native resveratrol , the bioaccessibility of resveratrol embedded in nanocomplexes and nanoparticles was increased to 60 % and 80 % , respectively. These findings suggest that OVA/CMC nanocomplexes and nanoparticles have potential applications in the development of effective oral delivery systems of resveratrol as well as other lipophilic nutraceuticals into functional foods.
