 Specific gene knockdown facilitated by short interfering RNA ( siRNA) is a potential approach for suppressing the expression of ion channels and transporter proteins to kill breast cancer cells. The overexpression of calcium ion channels and transporter genes is seen in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Since naked siRNA is anionic and prone to nuclease-mediated degradation , it has limited permeability across the cationic cell membrane and short systemic half-life , respectively. Carbonate apatite ( CA) nanoparticles were formulated , characterized , loaded with a series of siRNAs , and delivered into MCF-7 and 4T1 breast cancer cells to selectively knockdown the respective calcium and magnesium ion channels and transporters. Individual knockdown of
