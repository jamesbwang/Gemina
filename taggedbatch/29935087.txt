 Previous studies have shown that foamy viral ( FV) vectors are a promising alternative to gammaretroviral and lentiviral vectors and also that insulators can improve FV vector safety. However , in a previous analysis of insulator effects on FV vector safety , strong viral promoters were used to elicit genotoxic events. In the present study , we developed and analyzed the efficacy and safety of a high-titer , clinically relevant FV vector driven by the housekeeping promoter elongation factor-1α and insulated with an enhancer blocking A1 insulator ( FV-EGW-A1). Human CD34 FV-EGW-A1 resulted in high-marking , multilineage engraftment of human repopulating cells with no evidence of silencing. Engraftment was highly polyclonal with no clonal dominance and a promising safety profile based on integration site analysis. An FV vector with an elongation factor-1α promoter and an A1 insulator is a promising vector design for use in the clinic.
