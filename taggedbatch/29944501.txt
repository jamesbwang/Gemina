 To assess the visual acuity and compliance with the use of orthokeratology lenses ( OrthoK) in school children. A retrospective study was conducted to determine the education-related factors influencing the improvement in visual acuity in myopic students using OrthoK in five primary schools in Taiwan. Of the 5,173 eligible students from five primary schools , 1906 ( 36.8 %) students were diagnosed with myopia. Among 201 ( 10.6 %) students wearing OrthoK , 69.7 % had used them for at least 1 year , 53.2 % achieved visual acuity greater than 0.8 ( 6/7 .5 , log of minimal angle of resolution 0.1) in school , and 49.8 % had received health education related to OrthoK care. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a higher possibility to achieve visual acuity greater than 0.8 was associated with more than 1-year use of OrthoK , good compliance , and receiving health education from an ophthalmologist. It is important that children wearing OrthoK receive education and comply with the use of OrthoK for visual acuity improvement.
