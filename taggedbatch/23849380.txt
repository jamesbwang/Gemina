 Heterotopic Warthin 's tumor ( WT) arising from the cervical lymph nodes is uncommon and WT presenting concomitantly with classical Hodgkin 's lymphoma has only been previously reported three times in English literature. The current study presents an unusual case of classical Hodgkin lymphoma ( CHL) involving the heterotopic WT in a 59-year-old male. Histopathologic examination revealied a WT with extensive expansion of mixed-cellularity CHL in a lymph node in the right of the neck. Clinical staging was determined as stage IA disease. The patient received four courses of chemotherapy and local consolidative radiotherapy , no evidence of disseminated lymphoma was observed over the 6-month follow-up. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first well documented collision tumor between CHL and heterotopic WT of the cervical lymph nodes. The present case also expands the anatomical site of malignant lymphomas associated with WT.
