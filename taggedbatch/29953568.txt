 To evaluate the influence of cobalt-chromium ( Co-Cr) casting alloys ' melting temperatures on the cast-to Co-Cr implant cylinders ' marginal fit. Co-Cr alloys with different melting ranges were cast into 20 Co-Cr cylinders: 10 in a high-melting temperature ( HMT) group and 10 in a low-melting temperature ( LMT) group. Ten cylinders were used as received as a control group. Cylinders ' marginal misfit and dimensional stability were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy ( × 500). HMT cylinders showed significant differences in marginal misfit ( 2.48 ± 1.07 μm
