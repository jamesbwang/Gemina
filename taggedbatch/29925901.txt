 We have investigated the mechanisms by which a novel missense point mutation ( c. 1181G > A) found in two sisters causes Gitelman 's syndrome<disease><symptom> by impairing the sodium chloride co-transporter ( NCC , encoded by SLC12A3 gene) function. The cDNA and in vitro transcribed mRNA of either wild-type or mutated SLC12A3 were transfected into HEK293 cells and injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes , respectively. The expression , maturation , trafficking , and function of the mutated and wild-type NCC were assessed by Western blotting , immunohistochemistry and
