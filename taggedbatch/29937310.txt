 The addition of a blackthorn branch extract ( Prunus spinosa L.) to a gel emulsion system containing microalgal oil was examined in order to obtain a functional ingredient ( APG) , for use as fat replacer in beef patties. Chromatographic analysis indicated that catechins were the major polyphenols present in the Prunus spinosa L. extract. The antioxidant capacity increased as a result of the extract addition , as shown by the comparison of the gel emulsions , with and without it ( APG and AG , respectively). Beef patties containing APG as fat replacer ( modified patties) had a lower fat content ( 5.3 % versus 10.75 %) , doubled the antioxidant activity and the DHA content , and improved the stability against oxidation by reducing the peroxide content more than two fold when compared to control patties. In addition , instrumental color measured by the CIE L * a * b * system showed no significant difference between control and modified raw patties. Moreover , the sensory acceptability of the new formulation was confirmed by a like/dislike hedonic test.
