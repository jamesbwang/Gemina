 Positron emission tomography ( PET) is a radioisotope imaging technique capable of quantifying the regional distribution of molecular imaging probes targeted to biochemical pathways and processes allowing direct measurement of biochemical changes induced by cancer therapy , including the activity of targeted growth pathways and cellular populations. In this manuscript , we review the underlying principles of PET imaging , choices for PET radiopharmaceuticals , methods for tumor analysis and PET applications for cancer therapy response assessment including potential future directions.
