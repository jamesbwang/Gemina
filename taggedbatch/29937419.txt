 This study investigated the impact of Model of end-stage liver disease ( MELD)- score introduction ( MELDi) on waitlist mortality and post-liver transplant ( LT) survival in primary biliary cholangitis ( PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC). LT candidates with PSC or PBC listed between January 1983 and March 2016 were included and followed until December 2016. After MELDi in 2004 , PBC patients were listed according to labMELD , PSC patients according to the highest MELD during active cholangitis ( chMELD). In total , 100 PBC and 76 PSC patients were included. Waitlist mortality in PBC was significantly higher than in PSC ( 16 % vs. 5.3 % , p = 0.031) , whereas PSC patients were significantly more often withdrawn from the waitlist due to improved condition ( 3.0 % vs. 13.2 % , p = 0.017). Competing risks analysis identified MELDi ( HR = 4.12) and PBC ( HR = 2.95) as significant predictors of waitlist mortality. Yet , overall 10 y-patient survival increased after MELDi by 18.8 % leading to a 1 y- , 5 y- , and 10 y-patient survival of 98.2 % , 70.6 % and 70.6 % in PBC , and 83.3 % , 83.3 % , and 80.6 % in PSC , respectively. PSC patients showed significantly lower waitlist mortality irrespective of MELDi , whereas in PBC waitlist mortality further increased after MELDi. Utility of MELD and chMELD did not impair post LT outcome.
