 Periprosthetic osteolysis and aseptic loosening are mainly caused by wear particles ( Ps) that are generated from friction interfaces. However , the mechanisms underlying the development of aseptic loosening remain unclear. Therefore , we aimed toclarify how the myeloid differentiation factor 88 ( MyD88)- independent Toll-like receptor ( TLR) signaling pathway mediates cobalt and chromium ( CoCr)- Ps-induced osteolysis. We quantified the expression levels of TLRs , MyD88 , RANKL , and inflammatory factors in patients experiencing aseptic loosening after primary total hip arthroplasty ( THA) with metal-on-metal ( MoM) bearings and hip osteoarthritis ( hOA). We observed the in vitro and in vivo levels of RANKL , TLRs , and MyD88 in fibroblasts challenged with CoCr Ps by applying shMyD88 interference lentivirus vectors to block the MyD88-independent TLR pathway. The levels of TLRs , MyD88 , RANKL , and inflammatory factors in the revision THA ( rTHA) with MoM group were higher than those in the hOA group. Our data collectively revealed that inhibiting MyD88 expression could reduce osteoclastogenesis in vitro and CoCr-Ps-induced osteolysis in vivo. Our findings suggested that osteoclastogenesis is promoted by the CoCr-Ps-induced expression of RANKL in fibroblasts and that MyD88 is a potential target in the treatment of wear Ps-induced osteolysis.
