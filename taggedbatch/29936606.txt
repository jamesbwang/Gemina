 Physical activity is increasingly recommended for chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. In this review , we briefly survey recent , high-quality meta-analyses on the effects of exercise in human chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> populations , followed by a critical discussion of the rodent literature. Most meta-analytical studies on the effects of exercise in human chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> populations describe moderate improvements in various types of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , despite substantial variability in the outcomes reported in the primary literature. The most consistent findings suggest that while greater adherence to exercise programs produces better outcomes , there is minimal support for the superiority of one type of exercise over another. The rodent literature similarly suggests that while regular exercise reduces hypersensitivity<disease> in rodent models of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , exercise benefits do not appear to relate to either the type of injury or any particular facet of the exercise paradigm. Potential factors underlying these results are discussed , including the putative involvement of stress-induced analgesic effects associated with certain types of exercise paradigms. Exercise research using rodent models of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> would benefit from increased attention to the role of stress in exercise-induced analgesia , as well as the incorporation of more clinically relevant exercise paradigms.
