 Migration of ions can lead to photoinduced phase separation , degradation , and current-voltage hysteresis in perovskite solar cells ( PSCs) , and has become a serious drawback for the organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite materials ( OIPs). Here , the inhibition of ion migration is realized by the supramolecular cation-π interaction between aromatic rubrene and organic cations in OIPs. The energy of the cation-π interaction between rubrene and perovskite is found to be as strong as 1.5 eV , which is enough to immobilize the organic cations in OIPs; this will thus will lead to the obvious reduction of defects in perovskite films and outstanding stability in devices. By employing the cation-immobilized OIPs to fabricate perovskite solar cells ( PSCs) , a champion efficiency of 20.86 % and certified efficiency of 20.80 % with negligible hysteresis are acquired. In addition , the long-term stability of cation-immobilized PSCs is improved definitely ( 98 % of the initial efficiency after 720 h operation) , which is assigned to the inhibition of ionic diffusions in cation-immobilized OIPs. This cation-π interaction between cations and the supramolecular π system enhances the stability and the performance of PSCs efficiently and would be a potential universal approach to get the more stable perovskite devices.
