 Cloaca , Hirschsprung disease , and anorectal malformations ( CHARM) are congenital anomalies of the hindgut. Small series have suggested that children suffering from one of these anomalies may be at risk for growth impairment. We sought to expand on these findings in a comprehensive cohort , hypothesizing that patients with Medicaid insurance or African-American ( AA) race would be at higher risk for poor growth. Following Institutional Review Board ( IRB) approval , single-institution retrospective review of children with CHARM anomalies was performed ( 2009-2016). Body mass index ( BMI) value Z-scores were obtained using the 2006 World Health Organization ( age 0-24 mo) and 2000 Centers for Disease Control ( CDC) ( age > 2 y) growth charts and calculators ( statistical analysis system). Patient factors and BMI Z-scores were analyzed with descriptive statistics and Fisher 's exact test. One hundred sixty-six patients ( Cloaca n = 16 , Hirschsprung disease ( HD) n = 71 , anorectal malformation ( ARM) n = 79) were identified. The BMI Z-score distribution for the entire CHARM cohort was lower than controls ( P < 0.0001). HD and ARM BMI Z-scores were also lower versus controls ( P < 0.0007 , P < 0.0037). Requiring more or less than the average number of surgeries did not impact BMI Z-score ( P = non-significant ( NS)). Patients with Medicaid had lower Z-scores versus private or commercial insurance ( P < 0.0001). AA race BMI Z-score distribution was lower than controls ( P < 0.0002) , but there was no statistical difference in BMI Z-scores when comparing AA versus non-AA CHARM patients ( P = NS). Patients born with CHARM anomalies are at risk for impaired growth. Furthermore study is warranted to identify modifiable risk factors contributing to this impairment. Longitudinal follow-up should include interventions to mitigate these risks.
