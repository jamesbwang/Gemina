 Steep inclination and excessive anteversion angles of acetabular cups could result in adverse edge-loading. This , in turn , increases contact pressure and impingement risk for traditional artificial hip joints. However , the influence of high inclination and anteversion angles on both the kinematics and contact mechanics of dual mobility hip implants has rarely been examined. This study focuses on investigating both the kinematics and contact mechanics of a dual mobility hip implant under different inclination and anteversion angles using a dynamic explicit finite element method developed in a previous study. The results showed that an inclination angle of both the back shell and liner ranging from 30 째 to 70 째 had little influence on the maximum contact pressure and the accumulated sliding distance of inner and outer surfaces of the liner under normal walking gait. The same results were obtained for an anteversion angle of the liner varying between -20 째 and +20 째. However , when the anteversion angle of the liner was beyond this range , the contact between the femoral neck and the inner rim of the liner occurred. Consequently , this caused a relative rotation at the outer articulation. This suggests that both inclination and modest anteversion angles have little influence on the kinematics and contact mechanics of dual mobility hip implants. However , too excessive anteversion angle could result in a rotation for this kind of hip implant at both articulations.
