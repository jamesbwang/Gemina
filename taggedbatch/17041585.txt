 Earth-abundant and efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER) and oxygen evolution reaction ( OER) are highly significant for renewable energy systems. However , the performance of existing electrocatalysts is usually restricted by the low electroic conductivity and the limited amount of exposed active sites. In this work , ( Fe
