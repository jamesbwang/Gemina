 The spread and publicity given to questionable practices in the corporate world during the last two decades have fostered an increasing interest about the importance of ethical work for organizations , practitioners , scholars and , last but not least , the wider public. Relying on the Social Identity Approach , we suggest that the effects of different ethical climates on employee behaviors are driven by affective identification with the organization and , in parallel , by cognitive moral ( dis) engagement. We compared the effects of two particular ethical climates derived from the literature: An ethical organizational climate of self-interest , and an ethical organizational climate of friendship. Three hundred seventy-six workers completed measures of Ethical Climate , Organizational Identification , Moral Disengagement , Organizational Citizenship Behaviors ( OCBs) , and Counterproductive Work Behaviors ( CWBs). Structural equation modeling confirmed that the two ethical climates considered were independently related to organizational identification and moral disengagement. These , in turn , mediated the effects of ethical climates on OCBs and CWBs. We discuss results in light of the social identity approach , and present some practical implications of our findings.
