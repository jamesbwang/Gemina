 Objective Oxidative stress appears to be a key factor in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases and a potential therapeutic target in allergy treatment. Allergic diseases are reportedly associated with reduced plasma levels of ascorbate , which is a key physiological antioxidant. Ascorbate prevents excessive inflammation<symptom> without reducing the defensive capacity of the immune system. Methods An interim analysis of a multicenter , prospective , observational study was conducted to investigate the change in disease-specific and nonspecific symptoms ( fatigue<symptom> , sleep disorders , depression<symptom> , and lack of mental concentration) during adjuvant treatment with intravenous vitamin C ( Pascorbin Â®; Pascoe , Giessen , Germany) in 71 patients with allergy-related respiratory or cutaneous indications. Results Between the start and end of treatment , the mean sum score of three disease-specific symptoms decreased significantly by 4.71 points and that of four nonspecific symptoms decreased significantly by 4.84 points. More than 50 % of patients took no other allergy-related medication besides vitamin C. Conclusions Our observations suggest that treatment with intravenous high-dose vitamin C reduces allergy-related symptoms. Our observations form a basis for planning a randomized controlled clinical trial to obtain more definitive evidence of the clinical relevance of our findings. We also obtained evidence of ascorbate deficiency in allergy-related diseases. Clinical Trials NCT02422901.
