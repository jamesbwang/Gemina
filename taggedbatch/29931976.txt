 The power conversion efficiencies ( PCEs) of potential polymer solar cells have been shown to rapidly exceed 15 %. However , these high-performance devices are based on halogenated solvents that pose a significant hazard to the atmospheric environment and human beings. The use of nonhalogenated solvents makes the device less efficient because of its solubility issues. In this work , we report high-efficiency devices utilizing PffBT4T-2OD and ( 6,6)- phenyl C
