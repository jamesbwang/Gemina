 Loeys-Dietz syndrome<disease><symptom> is a rare connective tissue disorder with widespread arterial tortuosity and aneurysms<disease>. This syndrome<disease><symptom> is most notable for its aortic disease , including aortic root dilation and aortic dissection or rupture. Although not as well studied , peripheral artery aneurysms<disease> are a prevalent concurrent manifestation and have previously been repaired with both open and endovascular approaches. There are minimal data about the durability and technical considerations of endovascular repair in this disease. We report a case of a patient who developed an extremely tortuous recurrent femoral-popliteal artery aneurysm<disease> secondary to aneurysmal degeneration around previously placed stents that was treated with an endovascular approach.
