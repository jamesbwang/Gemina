 Oligosaccharides derived from lactulose ( β-D-Galp- ( 1 → 4)- D-Fru) are drawing more and more attention nowadays because of their strong resistance to gut digestion , and the interest to discover novel prebiotics. Compared to galactooligosaccharides , currently known structures of lactulose oligosaccharides are very limited. In this study , the wild-type β-galactosidase BgaD-D of Bacillus<pathogen> circulans<pathogen> ATCC 31382 , as well as the derived mutant R484H , were used to synthesize oligosaccharides from lactulose. In total , 9 oligosaccharide structures were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS and NMR spectroscopy analysis. Trisaccharide β-D-Galp- ( 1 → 4)- β-D-Galp- ( 1 → 4)- D-Fru was the major structure produced by the wild-type enzyme , while the R484H mutant showed a preference for synthesis of β-D-Galp- ( 1 → 3)- β-D-Galp- ( 1 → 4)- D-Fru. Our study greatly enriched the structural information about oligosaccharides derived from lactulose.
