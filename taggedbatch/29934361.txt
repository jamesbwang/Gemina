 Urinary bladder cancer ( UBC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. UBC patients at muscle invasive stage have poor clinical outcome , due to high propensity for metastasis. Non-tumor activated fibroblasts , named α-SMA + Fs , is similar to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts ( CAFs) which could express α-SMA. However , whether α-SMA + Fs patients could induce UBC cell invasion is unclear. Herein , we found that characterization of primary α-SMA + Fs separated from PBOO ( partial bladder outlet obstruction) rats was fell in between normal fibroblasts ( α-SMA-Fs) and CAFs. Additionally , the conditional medium from α-SMA + Fs enhanced the NBT-II cell invasion through inducing EMT , and the oncogenic function of mixed supernatant of α-SMA + Fs/CAFs was stronger than that of CAFs. Inhibition of TGF-β1 by TGF-β1 neutralizing antibody decreased the EMT-associated gene expression and NBT-II cell invasion , suggesting that α-SMA + Fs can induce tumor EMT through TGF-β1. Xenograft experiments showed that the tumorigenic effect of α-SMA + Fs in mice was also between CAFs and α-SMA-Fs , and α-SMA + Fs/CAFs also had a strong tumorigenic effect. We preformed rats with PBOO and found that the incidence of invasive bladder cancer in PBOO+BBN group was higher than in BBN group , suggesting the PBOO treatment contributed to tumorigenesis. Thus , α-SMA + Fs promoted tumorigenesis by secreting TGF-β1 to induce EMT.
