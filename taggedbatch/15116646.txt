 This systematic review examines the current literature regarding surgical techniques for restoring articular cartilage in the hip , from the older microfracture techniques involving perforation to the subchondral bone , to adaptations of this technique using nanofractures and scaffolds. This review discusses the autologous and allograft transfer systems and the autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis ( AMIC) technique , as well as a summary of the previously discussed techniques , which could become common practice for restoring articular cartilage , thus reducing the need for total hip arthroplasty. Using the
