 BACKGROUND Improper use of antimicrobials can cause adverse drug events and high costs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency and potential drug-drug interactions associated with antimicrobials among hospitalized patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study was conducted on the same day in 5 different hospitals in Turkey. We included patients aged ³ 18 years who received at least 1 antimicrobial drug and at least 1 of any other drug. The Micromedex ® online drug reference system was used to control and describe the interactions. Drug interactions were classified as contraindicated , major , moderate , and minor. RESULTS Potential drug-drug interactions with antimicrobials were 26.4 % of all interactions. Five ( 42 %) of 12 contraindicated interactions and 61 ( 38 %) of 159 major interactions were with antimicrobials. Quinolones , triazoles , metronidazole , linezolid , and clarithromycin accounted for 173 ( 25.7 %) of 673 prescribed antimicrobials , but were responsible for 141 ( 92.1 %) of 153 interactions. In multivariate analysis , number of prescribed antimicrobials ( odds ratio: 2.3001 , 95 % CI: 1.6237-3.2582) , number of prescribed drugs ( odds ratio: 1.2008 , 95 % CI: 1.0943-1.3177) , and hospitalization in the university hospital ( odds ratio: 1.7798 , 95 % CI: 1.0035-3.1564) were independent risk factors for developing drug interactions. CONCLUSIONS Due to risk of drug interactions , physicians should be more cautious when prescribing antimicrobials , particularly when prescribing quinolones , linezolid , azoles , metronidazole , and macrolides.
