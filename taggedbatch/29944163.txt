 Cardiovascular disease ( CVD) is one of the leading causes of mortality in hemodialysis ( HD) subjects. In addition to the traditional risk factors that are common in these individuals , genetic factors are also involved , with emphasis on single nucleotide polymorphs ( SNPs). In this context , the present study aims to systematically review the studies that investigated the polymorphisms associated with cardiovascular risk in this population. In general , the SNPs present in HD individuals are those of genes related to inflammation<symptom> , oxidative stress and vascular calcification , also able of interfering in the cardiovascular risk of this population. In addition , polymorphisms in genes related to recognized risk factors for CVD , such as dyslipidemia , arterial hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy , also influence cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
