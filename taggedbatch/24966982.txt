 Mixed epithelial and stromal tumour of the kidney ( MEST) is a rare and distinctive neoplasm accounting for 0.2 % of all renal cancers. Most of these tumours behave in a benign fashion but 13 cases with malignant transformation have already been reported. We present the first case of an extremely aggressive MEST with rapid recurrence after radical treatment , demonstrating objective response to chemotherapy. A 31-year-old female presented to the hospital complaining of gross hematuria<symptom>. Computed tomography ( CT) revealed an intraparenchymal mass in the left kidney forming a tumour thrombus in the inferior vena cava ( IVC). Metastatic disease was ruled out and , under the clinical diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma , left radical nephrectomy with IVC thrombectomy was performed. The histopathological examination confirmed malignant MEST of the kidney. At the follow-up 12 months after surgery , a recurrent tumour in the left paravertebral area and a tumour thrombus in the IVC were detected. A second surgery was recommended and the mass from the paravertebral area was removed , so resection of the IVC with prosthetic replacement was performed. The histopathologic examination confirmed a recurrent malignant MEST. At the follow-up three months after the second surgery disease progression was diagnosed , so chemotherapy with ifosfamide and doxorubicin was initiated. The CT scan performed 14 months after the chemotherapy confirmed a stable process of the disease with no signs of progression. A literature review and our case report confirm the existence of extremely aggressive malignant MEST that shows response to chemotherapy. However , more reports are needed to improve our understanding about the biology of the MEST to develop any recommendations on personalized therapy.
