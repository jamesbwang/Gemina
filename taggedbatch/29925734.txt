 Glycogen synthase kinase-3 ( GSK-3) is a cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinase which is known to regulate a variety of cellular processes through a number of signaling pathways important for cell proliferation , stem cell renewal , apoptosis and development. Although GSK-3 exists in a variety of tissues , this kinase plays very important roles in the heart<symptom> to control its development through the formation of heart and cardiomyocyte proliferation. GSK-3 is also recognized as one of the main molecules that control cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis<disease>. Therefore , GSK-3 could be an attractive target for the development of new drugs to cure cardiac diseases. The present review summarizes the roles of GSK-3 in the signaling pathways and the heart , and discusses the possibility of new drug development targeting this kinase.
