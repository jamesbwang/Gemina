 Threatened preterm labor is a condition in which regular uterine contractions occur at least 1 time in 10 minutes and persist for more than 30 minutes before completion of 37 weeks of gestation without dilatation of the cervix. In preterm labor with cervical dilatation , the efficacy of tocolytics was proven for prolonging pregnancy. However , in threatened preterm labor , the efficacy of tocolytics has not yet been well studied. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of nifedipine versus a placebo for inhibiting uterine contraction in threatened preterm labor. A randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study with 206 threatened preterm labor patients was undertaken. The participants were randomly allocated into either nifedipine or placebo groups. The proportion of patients with successful treatment , gestational age at delivery , and neonatal outcome were compared between the 2 groups. After 90 minutes of treatment , 88.3 % of the nifedipine group and 69.9 % of the placebo group had no uterine contraction ( Nifedipine had a higher success rate for inhibiting threatened preterm contractions.
