 A new glucose-responsive insulin delivery system is fabricated using biomimetic peptide coacervates derived from the Humboldt squid ( Dosidicus Gigas) beak. Both insulin and glucose oxidase are coencapsulated within coacervate microdroplets. The glucose oxidase quickly responds to increasing glucose levels to generate a local acidic environment , thereby rapidly triggering the dissociation of pH-sensitive coacervates to release the insulin cargo. The rate of insulin release is dependent on the glucose level , increases under hyperglycemic conditions , and decreases under normoglycemic conditions. This glucose responsiveness mimics pancreatic Î²-cell function by releasing insulin according to glucose levels.
