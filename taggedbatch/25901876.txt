 Assessing residents by direct observation is the preferred assessment method for infrequently encountered subspecialty topics , but this is logistically challenging. We developed an assessment framework for internal medicine ( IM) residents in subspecialty topics , using tuberculosis<disease> diagnosis for proof of concept. We used a 4-step process at 8 academic medical centers that entailed ( 1) creating a 10-item knowledge assessment tool; ( 2) pilot testing on a sample of 129 IM residents and infectious<disease> disease<disease> fellow volunteers to evaluate validity evidence; ( 3) implementing the final tool among 886 resident volunteers; and ( 4) assessing outcomes via retrospective chart review. Outcomes included tool score , item performance , and rates of obtaining recommended diagnostics. Following tool development , 10 infectious<disease> disease<disease> experts provided content validity. Pilot testing showed higher mean scores for fellows compared with residents ( 7 ( SD = 1.8) versus 3.8 ( SD = 1.7) , respectively , Our assessment framework revealed knowledge and practice gaps in tuberculosis<disease> diagnosis in IM residents. Adopting this approach may help ensure assessment is not limited to frequently encountered topics.
