 An abstract is typically prepared as a preface to a paper or as a submission to an event , such as a conference , so as to have research work presented as an oral presentation or as a poster. The principles are identical. Abstracts are always restricted by a word count , typically circa 250 words , so the maximum of economy is needed to convey result/s. The tenets to be borne in mind are therefore brevity , clarity , simplicity and parsimony. This paper provides some pointers and guidelines.
