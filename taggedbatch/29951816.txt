 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects upper and lower motor neurons in the brain and the spinal<disease> cord. Due to the progressive neurodegeneration , ALS leads to paralysis and death caused by respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> 2-5 years after the onset of symptoms. There is no effective cure available. Most ALS cases are sporadic , without family history , whereas 10 % of the cases are familial. Identification of variants in more than 30 different loci has provided insight into the pathogenic molecular mechanisms mediating disease pathogenesis. Studies of a Drosophila melanogaster model for each of the ALS genes can contribute to uncovering pathophysiological mechanism of ALS and finding targets of the disease-modifying therapy. In this review , we focus on three ALS-causing genes: TAR DNA-binding protein ( TDP-43) , fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma ( FUS/TLS) , and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 ( C9orf72).
