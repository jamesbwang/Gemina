 Ingested foreign bodies occur in children younger than 3 years and pass uneventfully through the gastrointestinal tract. However , multiple magnet ingestion are associated with serious complications. A 9-year old male with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and vomiting 3 days prior to admission , underwent abdominal radiographs showing radiopaque foreign bodies. Ultrasonography ( US) independently discovered one magnet floating in the jejunum<symptom>. Preoperative Computed Tomography ( CT) confirmed the presence of two neighbouring magnets causing obstruction and beaking of an adjacent jejunal loop. Laparotomy led to uneventful recovery of transmesenteric fistula<disease> formation following pressure necrosis<symptom> in two jejunal loops. We present the first case of multiple magnet ingestion managed in our institution , where the prevalence of magnet ingestions is low due to unpopularity of magnet toys. Awareness of the potentially devastating effects of multiple magnets passing the pylorus and the contribution of different imaging modalities for the diagnosis are emphasized and discussed.
