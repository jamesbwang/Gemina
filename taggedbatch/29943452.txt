 Excessive use of uncoupling agents , previously used as weight<symptom> loss<symptom> agents , has led to the increase in body temperature and death. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the acute cardiac effects of mitochondrial protonophore in a rat model at a high dose , and its specific influence on cardiac substrate uptake. Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chloro phenyl hydrazone ( CCCP; 4 mg/kg) or vehicle ( dimethyl sulfoxide). Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , heart rate ( HR) and systolic function were recorded. Substrate uptake was monitored by radioactive tracers. Compared to the control group , the respiratory rate and body temperature increased , the left ventricle was dilated , and systolic function transiently deteriorated in the CCCP group. There was no difference in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and HR between the two groups. In cardiac substrate uptake , glucose uptake showed a 95 % increase ( P < 0.05) , and fatty acid uptake showed a 52 % decrease ( P < 0.05) in CCCP-administered group. The deleterious effects on cardiac function and the changes in substrate uptake were observed when administered with the protonophore at a high dose.
