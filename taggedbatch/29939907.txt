 Patients with pancreatic cancer generally experience increasing pain as their disease progresses , making the titration of opioids difficult. This study aimed to determine a correlation between prescribed opioid doses and survival time in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. This retrospective observational cohort study in a tertiary care institution reviewed the medical records of patients diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer and treated over a 10-year period. We screened 1152 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer , and 566 were eligible for inclusion in this study. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between initial opioid dose and survival time from initial opioid dose ( correlation coefficient , -0.184; P < 0.01) and survival time from initial pancreatic cancer diagnosis ( correlation coefficient , -0.177; P < 0.01). In addition , there were 0.8 % and 0.6 % increases in initial opioid dosage ( morphine equivalent daily dose) and rate of increasing opioid dose ( morphine equivalent daily dose per month) , respectively , associated with the risk of early death ( â‰¤ 180 days , P < 0.05). Correlations between patient survival , initial opioid dose , final opioid dose , and the rate of increase of opioid dosage could provide useful information for clinicians treating unresectable pancreatic cancer patients.
