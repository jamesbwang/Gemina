 Glatiramer acetate ( GA) 20 mg/day ( GA20) is associated with immediate post-injection reactions ( PIRs). For convenience of use , approved GA 40 mg three times weekly ( GA40) delivers a similar weekly dose. The dose and concentration of a single GA40 injection are , however , twice as high as for GA20 , and post-injection adverse events may differ. Cases of atypical PIRs to GA40 prompted us to systematically monitor such events. The aim was to characterize atypical PIRs in multiple sclerosis ( MS) patients treated with GA40. Clinical practice data were prospectively collected in consecutive relapsing-remitting MS patients. Descriptive statistics for categorical and continuous variables , Mann-Whitney and Chi-squared tests for baseline comparisons , and Cox regression models for association of variables to first atypical PIRs were applied. Forty-six out of 173 patients ( 26.6 %) given GA40 experienced any PIRs. Of those , 38 ( 22.0 %) had atypical , 14 ( 8.1 %) had combined typical and atypical , and 26 ( 15.0 %) had recurrent atypical PIRs , most frequently shivering ( 13.3 %) and nausea/vomiting ( 8.1 %). Compared to typical PIRs , onset of atypical PIRs was significantly delayed ( median 30 vs 1 min , p < 0.0001) , and their median duration longer ( median 120 vs 6 min , p = 0.00013). Previous exposure to GA20 was associated with a lower risk of atypical PIRs ( hazard ratio ( HR) = 0.35 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.17-0.72 , p = 0.0039). Patients experiencing PIRs with GA20 were at elevated risk for atypical PIRs with GA40 ( HR = 5.75 , 95 % CI 1.66-19.94 , p = 0.0059). Atypical PIRs with GA40 , especially gastrointestinal symptoms and/or fever/shivering , had a delayed onset and occurred in a significant proportion of our patients. Their real prevalence should be assessed in appropriately designed studies accounting for nocebo responses. Initial dose titration might reduce PIR frequency.
