 The type III secretion system ( T3SS) forms the functional core of injectisomes , protein transporters that allow bacteria to deliver virulence factors into their hosts for infection , and flagella , which are critical for many pathogens to reach the site of infection. In spite of intensive genetic and biochemical studies , the T3SS protein export mechanism remains unclear due to the difficulty of accurate measurement of protein export
