 The chiral induced spin selectivity ( CISS) effect in which selective transport of electron spins through helical chiral molecules occurs , has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. This effect was used to magnetize ferromagnetic ( FM) samples by utilizing adsorbed chiral molecules. The electron transfer through the molecules was generated optically or electrically. In the optical configuration , circularly polarized light induced efficient magnetization by spin torque transfer ( STT) , using a hybrid of quantum dots ( QDs) and chiral molecule self-assembled monolayer ( SAM). Here , we use X-ray magnetic chiral dichroism ( XMCD) spectroscopy in order to probe the optically induced magnetization on thin FM films. The results show differences in the FM magnetization depending on the optical circular polarization , matching previous non-local Hall probe measurements.
