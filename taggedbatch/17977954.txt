 Obese adolescent girls are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes , characterized by defects in insulin secretion and action. We sought to determine if later glucose peak timing ( > 30 minutes) , 1-hour glucose > 155 mg/dl , or monophasic pattern of glucose excursion during an oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT) reflect a worse cardiometabolic risk profile. Post-pubertal overweight/obese adolescent girls without diabetes were studied ( N = 88; age , 15.2 ± 0.2 years; body mass index percentile , 97.7 ± 0.5). All participants completed an OGTT and body composition measures. Thirty-two girls had a four-phase hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with isotope tracers , vascular imaging , and muscle mitochondrial assessments. Participants were categorized by glucose peak timing ( ≤ 30 min = early; > 30 min = late) , 1-hour glucose concentration ( ± 155 mg/dL) and glucose pattern ( monophasic , biphasic). Girls with a late ( N = 54) vs earlier peak ( n = 34) timing had higher peak glucose (
