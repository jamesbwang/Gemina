 Littre hernia is defined as the herniation of a Meckel 's diverticulum , while Richter 's hernia is the herniation of a portion of the bowel wall. An extremely rare case of a combined Littre and Richter 's femoral hernia is reported. An 82-year-old male presented at the emergency department with a painful golf ball-like mass at the right inguinofemoral region. With the diagnosis of incarcerated femoral hernia , he was urgently taken to the operating room. Intraoperatively , an incarcerated Littre , as well as a Richter 's hernia were revealed. Enterectomy and side-to-side small bowel anastomosis were performed. The patient made an uneventful recovery. To the best of our knowledge , the present is the first report of a combined Littre and Richter 's femoral hernia. Such findings should be reported to raise the awareness of surgeons for complicated cases. It is of utmost importance to have a high suspicion index for strangulated hernias , to minimize the time between admission and surgery.
