 Both metals and metal-based nanoparticles ( NPs) can easily accumulate in soil , posing risks for plants and microbes. However , the interaction between NPs and toxic metals coexisting in soil is not yet well understood. Here , we studied the combined effects of ZnO NPs and Cd on sweet sorghum inoculated with or without the arbuscular mycorrhizal ( AM) fungus Funneliformis caledonium. Plants were grown in soil amended with ZnO NPs ( 50 , 250 , and 500 mg/kg) , alone or in combination with 5 mg/kg Cd. The two higher doses of ZnO NPs inhibited plant growth , leading to synergistic toxicity with Cd. However , at the lowest dose , ZnO NPs were non-phytotoxic , displaying antagonistic interactions with Cd on plant growth. When added with high doses of ZnO NPs , Cd significantly increased root Zn concentrations , but decreased shoot Zn concentrations at the low dose. Conversely , all doses of ZnO NPs significantly decreased shoot and root Cd concentrations. Furthermore , high doses of ZnO NPs generally inhibited soil enzyme activities , but Cd addition showed no significant or even stimulative effects , and mitigated the inhibitory effects of ZnO NPs. AM inoculation increased plant growth and P nutrition , and soil enzyme activities. When the low dose of ZnO NPs was added alone or in combination with Cd , AM inoculation decreased shoot Zn concentrations. Our results reveal complex interactions between ZnO NPs and Cd on plant growth and nutrition , plant Zn and Cd accumulation , and soil enzyme activities , while AM inoculation can help diminish the adverse effects induced by ZnO NPs and Cd.
