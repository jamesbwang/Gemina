 This study evaluated the patterns of care and health care resource use ( HCRU) in patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( SCCHN) who received ≥ 3 lines of systemic therapy in the United Kingdom ( UK). Oncologists ( n = 40) abstracted medical records for patients with metastatic SCCHN who initiated third-line systemic therapy during 1 January 2011-30 August 2014 ( n = 220). Patient characteristics , treatment patterns and SCCHN-related HCRU were summarised descriptively for the metastatic period; exploratory multivariable regression analyses were conducted on select HCRU outcomes. At metastatic diagnosis , most patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ( PS) of 0/1 ( 95 %). For patients with PS 0/1 , the most common first-line treatment was cisplatin +5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU); docetaxel was the most common second- and third-line treatment. For patients with PS ≥ 2 , the most common first- , second- , and third-line treatments were carboplatin +5-FU , cetuximab , and methotrexate , respectively. Most patients received supportive care during ( 85 %) and after ( 89 %) therapy. This study provides useful information , prior to the availability of immunotherapy , on patient characteristics , treatment patterns , HCRU , and survival in a real-world UK population with metastatic SCCHN receiving ≥ 3 lines of systemic therapy. Patterns of care and HCRU varied among patients with metastatic SCCHN; specific systemic therapies varied by patient PS.
