 Monoamine oxidase ( MAO) , a mitochondrial enzyme that oxidizes biogenic amines generating hydrogen peroxide , is a major source of oxidative stress in cardiac injury. However , the molecular mechanisms underlying its overactivation in pathological conditions are still poorly characterized. Here , we investigated whether the enhanced MAO-dependent hydrogen peroxide production can be due to increased substrate availability using a metabolomic profiling method. We identified N
