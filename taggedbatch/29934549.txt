 Opioid use disorder ( OUD) is associated with a high risk of premature death. Medication-assisted treatment ( MAT) is the primary treatment for opioid dependence. We comprehensively assessed the effects of different MAT-related characteristics on mortality among those with OUD by a systematic review and meta-analysis. The all-cause and overdose crude mortality rates ( CMRs) and relative risks ( RRs) by treatment status , different type , period , and dose of medication , and retention time were pooled using random effects , subgroup analysis , and meta-regression. Thirty cohort studies involving 370,611 participants ( 1,378,815 person-years) were eligible in the meta-analysis. From 21 studies , the pooled all-cause CMRs were 0.92 per 100 person-years ( 95 % CI: 0.79-1.04) while receiving MAT , 1.69 ( 1.47-1.91) after cessation , and 4.89 ( 3.54-6.23) for untreated period. Based on 16 studies , the pooled overdose CMRs were 0.24 ( 0.20-0.28) while receiving MAT , 0.68 ( 0.55-0.80) after cessation of MAT , and 2.43 ( 1.72-3.15) for untreated period. Compared with patients receiving MAT , untreated participants had higher risk of all-cause mortality ( RR 2.56 ( 95 % CI: 1.72-3.80)) and overdose mortality ( 8.10 ( 4.48-14.66)) , and discharged participants had higher risk of all-cause death ( 2.33 ( 2.02-2.67)) and overdose death ( 3.09 ( 2.37-4.01)). The all-cause CMRs during and after opioid substitution treatment with methadone or buprenorphine were 0.93 ( 0.76-1.10) and 1.79 ( 1.47-2.10) , and corresponding estimate for antagonist naltrexone treatment were 0.26 ( 0-0.59) and 1.97 ( 0-5.18) , respectively. Retention in MAT of over 1-year was associated with a lower mortality rate than that with retention â‰¤ 1 year ( 1.62 , 1.31-1.93 vs. 5.31 , -0.09-10.71). Improved coverage and adherence to MAT and post-treatment follow-up are crucial to reduce the mortality. Long-acting naltrexone showed positive advantage on prevention of premature death among persons with OUD.
