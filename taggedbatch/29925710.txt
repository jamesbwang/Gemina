 This study assessed push-out strength , cement layer thickness , and interfacial nanoleakage of luted fiber posts fabricated with computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture ( CAD/CAM) technology after use of 1 of 3 scanning techniques , namely , direct scanning of the post space ( DS) , scanning of a polyether impression of the post space ( IS) , and scanning of a plaster model of the post space ( MS). Thirty premolars were randomly assigned to three groups corresponding to the scanning technique. Posts were computer-designed and milled from experimental fiber-reinforced composite blocks. The mean ( ± SD) values for push-out strength and cement thickness were 17.1 ± 7.7 MPa and 162 ± 24 μm , respectively , for DS , 10.7 ± 4.6 MPa and 187 ± 50 μm for IS , and 12.0 ± 7.2 MPa and 258 ± 78 μm for MS specimens. Median ( interquartile range) interfacial nanoleakage scores were 3 ( 2-4) for DS , 2.5 ( 2-4) for IS , and 3 ( 2-4) for MS. Post retention was better for fiber posts fabricated by DS technique than for those fabricated by IS and MS. Cement thickness did not differ between DS and IS specimens , but the cement layer was significantly thicker in the MS group than in the other two groups. Scanning technique did not affect sealing ability , as the three groups had comparable nanoleakage values.
