 Various methods have been described for intermaxillary fixation ( IMF) for treatment of faciomaxillary injuries. Many studies have been described to evaluate the efficacy of different methods. Hanger plate method has not been commonly used. The aim of the present study was to compare the advantages and disadvantages of this method over Erich arch bar in mandibular fracture. Sixty patients of only mandibular fracture presenting to trauma center requiring open reduction and internal fixation under general anesthesia were randomly allocated to Group A and Group B comprising thirty patients in each. Group A included patients who received IMF with Erich arch bar. Group B included patients who received IMF with hanger plate method. The two groups were compared for time duration of intermaxillary procedure , total duration of surgery , oral hygiene score , postoperative occlusion , and complications. The average time of intermaxillary procedure , total duration of surgery , and wire prick injuries were more in Group A. Oral hygiene score was significantly better in Group B. Postoperative<disease> occlusion was comparable between the two groups. There was screw loosening in four patients in Group B , but none had tooth root injury. The cost of material for IMF was more in Group B. IMF with hanger plate method is more safe and efficacious compared to Erich arch bar in the treatment of mandibular fractures.
