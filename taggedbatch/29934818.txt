 This study aims to detect the neural substrate underlying the language impairment in children with developmental language disorder ( DLD) using diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI) tractography. Deterministic DTI tractography was performed in a group of right-handed children with DLD ( N = 17; mean age 10; 07 ± 2; 01 years) and a typically developing control group matched for age , gender and handedness ( N = 22; mean age 11; 00 ± 1; 11 years) to bilaterally identify the superior longitudinal fascicle , arcuate fascicle , anterior lateral segment and posterior lateral segment ( also called dorsal language network) and the middle and inferior longitudinal fascicle , extreme capsule fiber system and uncinate fascicle ( also called ventral language network). Language skills were assessed using an extensive , standardized test battery. Differences in language performance , white matter organization and structural lateralization of the language network were statistically analyzed. Children with DLD showed a higher overall volume and higher ADC values for the left-hemispheric language related WM tracts. In addition , in children with DLD , the majority ( 88 %; 7/8) of the studied language related WM tracts did not show a significant left or right lateralization pattern. These structural alterations might underlie the language impairment in children with DLD.
