 Mucosal-associated invariant T ( MAIT) cells represent a population of innate T cells that is highly abundant in humans. MAIT cells recognize metabolites of the microbial vitamin B pathway that are presented by the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC) class I-related protein MR1. Upon bacterial infection , activated MAIT cells produce diverse cytokines and cytotoxic effector molecules and accumulate at the site of infection , thus , MAIT cells have been shown to be protective against various bacterial infections. Here , we summarize the current knowledge of the role of MAIT cells in bacterial pulmonary<disease> infection<disease> models.
