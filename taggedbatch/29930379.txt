 Core 1 Î²1,3-galactosyltransferase ( C1GALT1) controls the crucial step of GalNAc-type O-glycosylation and is overexpressed in various<disease> human malignancies. However , its role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC) remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that C1GALT1 expression is upregulated in HNSCC tumors and is associated with adverse clinicopathologic features. Moreover , high C1GALT1 expression predicts poor disease-free and overall survivals. C1GALT1 overexpression enhances HNSCC cell viability , migration , and invasion , which can be reversed by erlotinib. Silencing of C1GALT1 suppresses the malignant behavior both in vitro and in vivo. Mass spectrometry and lectin pull-down assays demonstrate that C1GALT1 modifies O-glycans on EGFR. Blocking O-glycan elongation on EGFR by C1GALT1 knockdown decreases EGF-EGFR binding affinity and inhibits EGFR signaling , thereby suppressing malignant phenotypes. Using molecular docking simulations , we identify itraconazole as a C1GALT1 inhibitor that directly binds C1GALT1 and promotes its proteasomal degradation , leading to significant blockade of C1GALT1-mediated effects in HNSCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Collectively , our findings demonstrate a critical role of O-glycosylation in HNSCC progression and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting C1GALT1 in HNSCC treatment.
