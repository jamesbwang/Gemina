 Subcortical ischemic vascular dementia caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion due to small-artery disease is a common subtype of vascular dementia , which is recognized as the second most prevalent type of dementia. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of carnosine on white matter damage in corpus striatum<pathogen>. Adult male mice ( C57BL/6 strain) were subjected to right unilateral common carotid arteries occlusion ( rUCCAO) , and treated with carnosine or saline. Kl√ºver-Barrera staining , immunohistochemical analyses , Western blots and neurochemical analysis were performed after rUCCAO. The white matter in corpus striatum<pathogen> was damaged at day 37 after rUCCAO , which was largely rescued by carnosine ( 200 , 500 mg/kg). Carnosine ( 200 , 500 mg/kg) significantly recovered the expression of myelin basic protein , suppressed the activation of microglia and reversed the decrease of 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine levels in corpus striatum<pathogen>. Moreover , carnosine ( 200 , 500 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the apoptosis in corpus striatum<pathogen>. These data suggest that carnosine has the neuroprotective effect in corpus striatum<pathogen> on rUCCAO in mice , may be due to its protection of neurotransmitters and inhibition of apoptosis.
