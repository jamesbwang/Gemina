 To investigate the effects of a 6-month exercise program on cognition and mobility in participants with multiple sclerosis. Prospective , single blind , controlled clinical trial. A community rehabilitation program within a large metropolitan health service. Twenty-eight patients with multiple sclerosis , referred for outpatient rehabilitation. Participants were allocated to one of two groups and undertook a cognitive-motor exercise program or monitoring ( control group). Cognition and mobility. Cognition was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Frontal Assessment Battery. Mobility was assessed with the Timed Get-Up-and-Go-Test , applied with and without dual task distractors. The findings showed benefits provided by exercise on cognition and mobility. Differently , participants of the control group did not have significant changes in cognition scores after 6 months of follow-up , and had a worse performance in mobility tests. Six months of exercise provided benefits to cognition and mobility in adults with multiple sclerosis. This trial was registered prospectively with the Brazilian Clinical Trials Register , ID: RBR-9gh4km , ( http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/?q=RBR-9gh4km).
