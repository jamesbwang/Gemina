 Methods of measuring nasal obstruction outcomes include both objective anatomic and physiologic measurements , as well as subjective patient-reported measures. Anatomic measurements include acoustic rhinometry , imaging studies , and clinician-derived examination findings. Physiologic measures include rhinomanometry , nasal peak inspiratory flow , and computational fluid dynamics. Patient-reported outcome measures ( PROMs) are self-reported assessments of disease-specific quality-of-life outcomes. Several studies attempted correlation of these outcome measures; however , few show strong correlation. Expert opinion favors determining successful surgical outcomes using PROMs. This review provides a summary of current nasal obstruction outcome measures.
