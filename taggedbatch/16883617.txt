 Advance care planning ( ACP) is a continuous , dynamic process of reflection and dialogue between an individual , those close to them and their healthcare professionals , concerning the individual 's preferences and values concerning future treatment and care , including end-of-life care. Despite universal recognition of the importance of ACP for people with dementia , who gradually lose their ability to make informed decisions themselves , ACP still only happens infrequently , and evidence-based recommendations on when and how to perform this complex process are lacking. We aimed to develop evidence-based clinical recommendations to guide professionals across settings in the practical application of ACP in dementia care. Following the Belgian Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 's procedures , we 1) performed an extensive literature search to identify international guidelines , articles reporting heterogeneous study designs and grey literature , 2) developed recommendations based on the available evidence and expert opinion of the author group , and 3) performed a validation process using written feedback from experts , a survey for end users ( healthcare professionals across settings) , and two peer-review groups ( with geriatricians and general practitioners). Based on 67 publications and validation from ten experts , 51 end users and two peer-review groups ( 24 participants) we developed 32 recommendations covering eight domains: initiation of ACP , evaluation of mental capacity , holding ACP conversations , the role and importance of those close to the person with dementia , ACP with people who find it difficult or impossible to communicate verbally , documentation of wishes and preferences , including information transfer , end-of-life decision-making , and preconditions for optimal implementation of ACP. Almost all recommendations received a grading representing low<symptom> to very low-quality evidence. No high-quality guidelines are available for ACP in dementia care. By combining evidence with expert and user opinions , we have defined a unique set of recommendations for ACP in people living with dementia. These recommendations form a valuable tool for educating healthcare professionals on how to perform ACP across settings.
