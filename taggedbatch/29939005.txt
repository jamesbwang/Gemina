 Surface charge transfer doping ( SCTD) is a promising technique to construct high-performance nanodevices because of its high reproducibility and high spatial selectivity and because it does little harm to the host semiconductor. Here , we performed a first-principles theoretical investigation to assess the effects of SCTD on the properties of two-dimensional ( 2D) arsenene , antimonene , and arsenene/antimonene van der Waals heterostructure as well. It was found that doping O or S on the surfaces of arsenene and antimonene could achieve efficient p-type doping , while doping Cs
