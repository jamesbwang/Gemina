 Although it is well known that platelet depletion is one of the major adverse events related to tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI) therapy , the effect of TKIs on thrombopoietin ( TPO) , a stimulating factor for thrombopoiesis , has not been examined to date. In this study , we investigated the effect of TKIs on the levels of plasma TPO concentration in patients with well-controlled chronic myeloid leukemia<disease> receiving imatinib or dasatinib and those in treatment-free remission ( TFR). Blood samples for blood cell counts and plasma TPO levels were obtained from 23 dasatinib-treated patients before and 1 h after intake , 11 patients treated with imatinib before and 2 h after intake , and nine TFR patients. Levels of plasma TPO were determined by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Levels of TPO were significantly inversely correlated with platelet counts in the entire cohort ( r =- 0.568 , p < 0.0001). Dasatinib intake , but not imatinib , significantly reduced platelet counts after intake ( p = 0.0009 in dasatinib and p = 0.5431 in imatinib). However , imatinib and dasatinib intake increased the levels of TPO in these patients ( p = 0.0024 , dasatinib; p = 0.0098 , imatinib). Our study results suggest that neither dasatinib nor imatinib therapy inhibits TPO production. Rather , transient increases in TPO levels seen with these two treatments might be a result of the decrease in TPO clearance these TKIs confer. However , further investigations are required to clarify the effect of TKIs on thrombopoiesis.
