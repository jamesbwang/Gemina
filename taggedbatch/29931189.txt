 Amino acid residues showing above background levels of conservation are often indicative of functionally significant regions within a protein. Understanding how the sequence conservation profile relates in space requires projection onto a protein structure , a potentially time-consuming process. 3DPatch is a web application that streamlines this task by automatically generating multiple sequence alignments ( where appropriate) and finding structural homologs , presenting the user with a choice of structures matching their query , annotated with residue conservation scores in a matter of seconds. 3DPatch is written in JavaScript and is freely available at http://www.skylign.org/3DPatch/. Mozilla Firefox , Google Chrome , and Safari web browsers are supported. Source code is available under MIT license at https://github.com/davidjakubec/3DPatch.
