 In this research , we propose a new simple method to fabricate hydrogen gas sensors by stacking multiwall carbon nanotube ( MWCNT) sheets. MWCNT sheets offer a larger surface area and more CNT contact , which are key factors for gas sensing , because of their super-high alignment and end-to-end structure compared to traditional CNT film. Besides , MWCNT sheets can be directly drawn from spinnable CNT arrays on large scales. Therefore , this method is a potential answer for the mass production and commercialization of CNT-based sensors with high responsivity. By stacking layers of sheets in various arrangements , the microstructure and CNT interactions in the layers were changed and their influence on gas sensing investigated. It was observed that the sample with three layers of sheet and functionalized with 3 nm thick Pd showed the best gas sensing performance , with a response of 12.31 % at 4 % H
