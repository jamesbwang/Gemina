 Non-selective inhibitors of spleen tyrosine kinase ( SYK) efficiently suppress disease in T cell-dependent models of crescentic glomerulonephritis<disease>. However , the therapeutic potential of selective SYK inhibitors in this disease has not been established. In addition , we lack knowledge regarding SYK expression in non-myeloid cells in glomerulonephritis<disease>. We addressed these two issues in a rat model of nephrotoxic serum nephritis ( NTN) using a SYK inhibitor , GS-492429. Disease was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats ( Study 1) or Wistar-Kyoto ( WKY) rats ( Study 2) by immunization with sheep IgG and administration of sheep anti-rat nephrotoxic serum. Animals were untreated or received GS-492429 ( 30 mg/kg/bid) or vehicle treatment from 2 h before nephrotoxic serum injection until being killed 3 or 24 h later ( Study 1) or 14 days later ( Study 2). Two-colour confocal microscopy found that SYK expression in NTN kidney was restricted to myeloid cells and platelets , with no evidence of SYK expression by T cells , mesangial cells , podocytes or tubular epithelial cells. In Study 1 , GS-492429 treatment significantly reduced glomerular neutrophil and macrophage infiltration , with protection from glomerular thrombosis and proteinuria<symptom>. In Study 2 , GS-492429 treatment reduced glomerular crescent formation by 70 % on day 14 NTN in conjunction with reduced glomerular thrombosis , glomerulosclerosis and tubular damage. This was accompanied by a marked reduction in markers of inflammation<symptom> ( CCL2 , TNF-Î± , NOS2 , MMP-12). Importantly , the protective effects of GS-492429 were independent of T cell infiltration and activation and independent of JAK/STAT3 signalling. In conclusion , this study demonstrates that a SYK inhibitor can suppress the development of crescentic glomerulonephritis<disease> through effects upon myeloid cells and platelets.
