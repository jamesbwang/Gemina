 Central venous port ( CVP) placement is performed by a variety of surgeons in different subspecialties , and our previous work suggests that individual surgeons-regardless of training-are the strongest predictor of outcomes. We sought to prospectively evaluate a programmatic shift toward a resource-conscious , patient-focused algorithm for this common and simple surgical procedure. After implementation of a systems-level program for efficient CVP placement , 78 CVPs were placed by a single surgeon. Primary outcomes were procedure time , total operating room ( OR) time , total facility time , and procedure-related complications. These prospective data were compared with retrospective cohorts of surgically placed and interventional radiology-placed CVP. Demographic data were analyzed by chi-square analysis , whereas time data were analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The programmatic delivery ( prospective) set showed significantly shorter procedural ( median 16 min versus 26-40 , P < 0.05) , OR times ( median 36 min versus 46-70 , P < 0.05) , and facility times ( median 235 min versus 299-319 , P < 0.05) except for the interventional radiology facility time ( median 187 versus 235 , P < 0.05). The range of OR time savings with the prospective versus comparison groups was 10-34 min , representing 22 % -49 % reductions in OR time ( P < 0.05). Complication rates were not significantly different ( P = 0.13). Through a programmatic change emphasizing efficiency and patient-centered outcomes , procedural/OR/facility time can be reduced greatly without changing complication rates. These data provide compelling evidence that common and ostensibly simple operative procedures can be substantially improved upon with thoughtful , data-driven systems-level enhancements.
