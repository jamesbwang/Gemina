 This secondary analysis quantified the psychometric properties of the Ohio Modified Arm-Motor Ability Test ( OMAAT) in a sample of neurologically stable chronic stroke survivors ( n = 67 , 40 men; mean age 59.8 yr , standard deviation = 12.8; 42 White , 23 Black , 2 other; 92.5 % right-sided lesion<symptom>; 44 ischemic stroke). Findings indicate high OMAAT internal consistency ( Cronbach 's α = .97 , ordinal α = .98 , Gugiu 's bootstrap reliability = .97) , unidimensionality , and strong positive factor loadings for all 20 OMAAT items. Convergent validity between OMAAT and Action Research Arm Test total scores was strong ( r = .90 , p < .0001). The OMAAT is the first short measure of upper extremity functional limitation available to clinicians and researchers that includes an administration manual and that has been examined using nonparametric psychometrics. A detailed administration manual is provided as a supplement to this article.
