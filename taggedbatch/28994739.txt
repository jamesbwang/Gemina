 Data sourcesSciVerse Scopus , ISIS Web of Science , Cochrane library , Medline/PubMed. Studies published from 1996 to 2017 in English were considered.Study selectionTwo independent reviewers screened the literature. Randomised clinical trials , non-randomised clinical trials with parallel groups or single group , retrospective studies) evaluating different posterior restorations ( class I , class II restorations and crowns) with different materials ( amalgam , compomer , composite , glass ionomer cement , stainless steel crown) placed in primary teeth by reporting different outcomes measures ( survival rate , success rate , annual failure rate). Data extraction and synthesisTwo independent reviewers extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. A qualitative analysis was conducted.ResultsThirty-one studies were included. Seven different materials were used for restorations: amalgam ( six studies) , compomer ( nine studies) , composite ( six studies) , conventional glass ionomer cement ( five studies) , metal-reinforced glass ionomer cement ( MRGIC) ( four studies) , resin-modified glass ionomer cement ( ten studies) , and stainless steel crown ( SSC) ( three studies). When considering the annual failure rate ( AFR) , composite showed the lowest ( 1.7-12.9 %) and MRGIC showed the highest ( 10.0-29.9 %). For the success rate , SSC presented the highest ( 96.1 %) and MRGIC presented the lowest ( 57.4 %). Class I restorations and restorations placed under the use of rubber dam revealed better results in both AFR and success rate. The main reason for failure was secondary caries.ConclusionsThere is a large variation in longevity of posterior restorations in primary teeth. Secondary caries<disease> is the main reason causing failure.
