 School-based education programs can be an effective way of educating adolescents about the dangers of exposure to sunlight and about preventive measures against this exposure and its relation to skin cancer. The aim of this study is to survey the effect of educational intervention based on the PRECEDE model on promoting skin cancer preventive behaviors in high school students of Fasa City , Fars Province , Iran. In this quasi-experimental study , 300 students ( 150 in experimental group and 150 in control group) in Fasa City , Fars Province , Iran , were selected in 2016-2017. The educational intervention for the experimental group consisted of six training sessions. A questionnaire consisting of demographic information , PRECEDE constructs ( knowledge , attitude , self-efficacy , enabling factors , and social support) , was used to measure skin cancer preventive behaviors before and 4 months after the intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22 and paired t test , independent t test , and chi-square test at a significance level of p < 0.05. The mean age of the students was 16.05 ± 1.76 years in the experimental group and 16.20 ± 1.71 years in the control group. Four months after the intervention , the experimental group showed a significant increase in the knowledge , attitude , self-efficacy , enabling factors , social support , and skin cancer preventive behaviors compared to the control group. This study showed the effectiveness of the intervention based on the PRECEDE constructs in adoption of skin cancer preventive behaviors in 4 months post-intervention in students. Hence , this model can act as a framework for designing and implementing educational intervention for the prevention of skin cancer.
