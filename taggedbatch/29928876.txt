 Recent studies have implied that circHIPK3 , an abundant circular RNA ( circRNA) , participates in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Its expression and potential functions in human gallbladder cancer were examined in this study. We show that circHIPK3 is upregulated in human gallbladder cancer cells. But its level is low in gallbladder epithelial cells. circHIPK3 silencing by targeted siRNA potently inhibited survival and proliferation of established and primary human gallbladder cancer cells , while inducing cell apoptosis. Conversely , ectopic over-expression of circHIPK3 can further promote cancer cell proliferation. In gallbladder cancer cells , circHIPK3 sponged the tumor-suppressive microRNA-124 ( miR-124) to sequester and inhibit its activity , thereby leading to increased expression of miR-124 targets , including ROCK1 ( rho-associated protein kinase 1) and CDK6 ( rho-associated protein kinase). Ectopic over-expression of miR-124 b y a lentiviral vector mimicked and abolished actions by circHIPK3 siRNA in gallbladder cancer cells. At last , we show that circHIPK3 is upregulated in human gallbladder cancer tissues , which is correlated with miR-124 downregulation and ROCK1-CDK6 upregulation. Together , we conclude that circHIPK3 promotes gallbladder cancer cell growth possibly by sponging miR-124. The over-expressed circHIPK3 could be a novel therapeutic target and diagnosis marker of human gallbladder cancer.
