 Mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau ( MAPT) gene have been linked to a heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders commonly called tauopathies. From patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with distinct atypical clinical phenotypes , we recently identified two new mutations on the same codon , in position 363 of the MAPT gene , which resulted in the production of Val-to-Ala ( tau
