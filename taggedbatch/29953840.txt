 Leisure is commonly treated as a means instead of an end goal of intervention. This approach , influenced by history and society 's past values , does not reflect the fact that leisure is meaningful and unique to its participants and has a significant effect on their health. On the basis of the core values of the occupational therapy profession and its role in the health care system , in this article we advocate that occupational therapists should expand their focus to include leisure as a goal of intervention. Although adopting this proposed approach may not be easy , given that it involves challenges in reimbursement for services , potential competition with other health professions , and a twisting of the deep-rooted existing values of occupational therapists , we believe the proposed solutions address these concerns and shed light on how to make leisure a valued goal of intervention.
