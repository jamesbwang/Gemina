For example , with bar treatments for physiological storage , ADL training , aid care , functional treatment with increasing load increase , sensitivity training , etc. , with the aim of helping the patient to carry out activities in his important areas of life and to largely independently create his own life.In rehabilitation clinics or in outpatient settings , occupational therapists pass on these treatment measures , adapting the therapy contents to the status and possibly changed needs of the patient and his goals in the rehabilitation process. Accompanying up to professional reintegration is possible.One domain of occupational therapy is the inclusion of contextual factors of the patient in therapy ( biopsychosocial model).
