 To achieve higher therapeutic efficiency with catabatic side effects , desirable nanocarriers should be designed to retain the loaded drug tightly during the systemic circulation , but release the drug rapidly and efficiently upon endocytosis by tumor cells. Herein , we synthesized a novel folate conjugated poly ( ethylene glycol)- poly ( L-glutamic acid)- poly ( L-phenylalanine) ( folate-PEG-PLG ( HS)- PPhe) copolymer to achieve a desired controlled delivery of doxorubicin ( DOX). The copolymer could self-assemble into interlayer-crosslinked micelles with reduction sensitivity , and DOX was successfully loaded into the interior of copolymer. The interlayer-crosslinked disulfide bond at the intermediate region of between PEG and poly ( L-phenylalanine) led to significant improvement of the system stability through the introduction of an additional mechanism of carrier/carrier interaction. The crosslinked interlayer could be cleaved at the desired target site under tumor-relevant reductive conditions and DOX were rapidly released from the DOX loaded folate-PEG-PLG ( HS)- PPhe micelles ( DOX-fPGPM) , and significantly lowered the drug leakage without glutathione ( GSH). Importantly , the DOX-fPGPM exhibited significantly higher antitumor efficiency both in vitro and in vivo in comparison with free DOX , and Doxil ( commercial doxorubicin-loaded liposomes). Biodistribution studies showed that DOX more effectively accumulated in tumor tissue after iv injection of DOXfPGPM. The DOX-fPGPM designed in this work potentially resolved the dilemma between systemic stability and rapid intracellular drug release , and would provide a promising nanomedicine platform for cancer therapy.
