 With the development of magnetic refrigerant technology , magnetic substances with a large magnetocaloric effect ( MCE) and nearly zero thermal hysteresis are desired. Although Ni-Mn based Heusler alloys have been found to produce large MCEs and have attracted increasing attention recently , the occurrence of thermal hysteresis accompanying MCE due to the nature of first-order phase transition limits its applications with magnetic refrigeration. Up to now , an effective theory or method to eliminate this thermal hysteresis is still lacking. Here , we propose to utilize the feature of magnetic transition at the morphotropic phase boundary ( MPB) to eliminate thermal hysteresis and thus design a MPB-involved phase diagram in Heusler alloys of Ni50Mn36Sb14-xInx ( x = 0-14). As theoretically expected , the magnetic transition at MPB really yields a MCE with a negligible thermal hysteresis ( âˆ¼ 0 K) and the refrigerant capacity arrives at a maximum value of 108.2 J kg-1 at the composition of x = 9. Our findings provide an effective way to design large MCE materials with zero thermal hysteresis.
