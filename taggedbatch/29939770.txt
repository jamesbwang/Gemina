 This was a placebo-controlled randomized study that aimed to investigate the effects of strength training ( ST) combined with antioxidant supplementation on muscle performance and thickness. Forty-two women ( age , 23.8 ± 2.7 years; body mass , 58.7 ± 11.0 kg; height , 1.63 ± 0.1 m) were allocated into 3 groups: vitamins ( n = 15) , placebo ( n = 12) , or control ( n = 15). The vitamins and placebo groups underwent an ST program , twice a week , for 10 weeks. The vitamins group was supplemented with vitamins C ( 1 g/day) and E ( 400 IU/day) during the ST period. Before and after training , peak torque ( PT) and total work ( TW) were measured on an isokinetic dynamometer , and quadriceps muscle thickness ( MT) was assessed by ultrasound. Mixed-factor ANOVA was used to analyze data and showed a significant group × time interaction for PT and TW. Both the vitamins ( 37.2 ± 5.4 to 40.3 ± 5.6 mm) and placebo ( 39.7 ± 5.2 to 42.5 ± 5.6 mm) groups increased MT after the intervention ( P < 0.05) with no difference between them. The vitamins ( 146.0 ± 29.1 to 170.1 ± 30.3 N · m) and placebo ( 158.9 ± 22.4 to 182.7 ± 23.2 N · m) groups increased PT after training ( P < 0.05) and PT was higher in the placebo compared with the control group ( P = 0.01). The vitamins ( 2068.3 ± 401.2 to 2295.5 ± 426.8 J) and placebo ( 2165.1 ± 369.5 to 2480.8 ± 241.3 J) groups increased TW after training ( P < 0.05) and TW was higher in the placebo compared with the control group ( P = 0.01). Thus , chronic antioxidant supplementation may attenuate peak torque and total work improvement in young women after 10 weeks of ST.
