 microRNAs regulate diverse biological processes such as development and aging by promoting degradation or inhibiting translation of their target mRNAs. In this study , we have found that the miR-58 family microRNAs regulate lifespan in C. elegans<pathogen>. Intriguingly , members of the miR-58 family affect lifespan differently , sometimes in opposite directions , and have complex genetic interactions. The abundances of the miR-58 family miRNAs are up-regulated in the long-lived daf-2 mutant in a daf-16-dependent manner , indicating that these miRNAs are effectors of insulin signaling in C. elegans<pathogen>. We also found that miR-58 is regulated by insulin signaling and partially required for the lifespan extension mediated by reduced insulin signaling , germline ablation , dietary restriction , and mild mitochondrial dysfunction. We further identified the daf-21 , ins-1 , and isw-1 mRNAs as endogenous targets of miR-58. Our study shows that miRNAs function in multiple lifespan extension mechanisms , and that the seed sequence is not the dominant factor defining the role of a miRNA in lifespan regulation.
