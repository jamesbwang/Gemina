 Standardization has emerged as the dominant principle guiding the organization and provision of healthcare , with standards resultantly shaping how nurses conceptualize and deliver patient care. Standardization has been critiqued as homogenizing diverse patient experiences and diminishing nurses ' skills and critical thinking; however , there has been limited examination of the philosophical implications of standardization for nursing knowledge and practice. In this manuscript , I draw on Foucault 's philosophy of order and categorization to inform an analysis of the consequences of healthcare standardization for the profession of nursing. I utilize three exemplars to illustrate the impact of the primacy of standardized thinking and practices on nurses , patients and families: pain assessments using the 0-10 pain scale; patient triage emergency departments through the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale; and determination of cause of death within the context of the current opioid crisis. Through each exemplar , I demonstrate that standardization reductively constrains nursing knowledge and the health and healthcare experiences of patients and populations. I argue that the centrality of standardization must be re-envisioned to embrace the complexity of health and more effectively and meaningfully frame nursing knowledge and practice within healthcare systems.
