 Direct-acting antivirals ( DAAs) have dramatically improved the outcome of patients with hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection including those with decompensated cirrhosis ( DC). We analyzed the evolution of indications and results of liver transplantation ( LT) in the past 10 years in Europe , focusing on the changes induced by the advent of DAAs. This is a cohort study based on data from the European Liver Transplant Registry ( ELTR). Data of adult LTs performed between January 2007 to June 2017 for HCV<pathogen> , hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) , alcohol ( EtOH) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH) were analyzed. The period was divided into different eras: interferon ( IFN/RBV; 2007-2010) , protease inhibitor ( PI; 2011-2013) and second generation DAA ( DAA; 2014-June 2017). Out of a total number of 60,527 LTs , 36,382 were performed in patients with HCV<pathogen> , HBV , EtOH and NASH. The percentage of LTs due to HCV-related liver disease varied significantly over time ( p < 0.0001) , decreasing from 22.8 % in the IFN/RBV era to 17.4 % in the DAA era , while those performed for NASH increased significantly ( p < 0.0001). In the DAA era , the percentage of LTs for HCV<pathogen> decreased significantly ( p < 0.0001) from 21.1 % ( first semester 2014) to 10.6 % ( first semester 2017). This decline was more evident in patients with DC ( HCV-DC , -58.0 %) than in those with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) associated with HCV<pathogen> ( HCV-HCC , -41.2 %). Conversely , three-year survival of LT recipients with HCV-related liver disease improved from 65.1 % in the IFN/RBV era to 76.9 % in the DAA era , and is now comparable to the survival of recipients with HBV<pathogen> infection ( p = 0.3807). In Europe , the number of LTs due to HCV<pathogen> infection is rapidly declining for both HCV-DC and HCV-HCC indications and post-LT survival has dramatically improved over the last three years. This is the first comprehensive study of the overall impact of DAA treatment for HCV<pathogen> on liver transplantation in Europe. After the advent of direct-acting antivirals in 2014 , a dramatic decline was observed in the number of liver transplants performed both in patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) , minus 60 % , and in those with hepatocellular carcinoma associated with HCV<pathogen> , minus 41 %. Furthermore , this is the first large-scale study demonstrating that the survival of liver transplant recipients with HCV-related liver disease has dramatically improved over the last three years and is now comparable to the survival of recipients with hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection. The reduction in HCV-related indications for LT means that there is a greater availability of livers , at least 600 every year , which can be allocated to patients with indications other than HCV<pathogen>.
