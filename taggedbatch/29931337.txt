 SAM-V is one of the class of riboswitches that bind S-adenosylmethione , regulating gene expression by controlling translation. We have solved the crystal structure of the metY SAM-V riboswitch bound to its SAM ligand at 2.5 Ã… resolution. The RNA folds as an H-type pseudoknot , with a major-groove triple helix in which resides the SAM ligand binding site. The bound SAM adopts an elongated conformation aligned with the axis of the triple helix , and is held at either end by hydrogen bonding to the adenine and the amino acid moieties. The central sulfonium cation makes electrostatic interactions with an U: A.U base triple , so conferring specificity. We propose a model in which SAM binding leads to association of the triplex third strand that stabilizes a short helix and occludes the ribosome binding site. Thus the new structure explains both ligand specificity and the mechanism of genetic control.
