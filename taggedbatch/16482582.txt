 Transposable elements ( TEs) are common and often present with high copy numbers in cellular genomes. Unlike in cellular organisms , TEs were previously thought to be either rare or absent in viruses. Almost all reported TEs display only one or two copies per viral genome. In addition , the discovery of pandoraviruses with genomes up to 2.5-Mb emphasizes the need for biologists to rethink the fundamental nature of the relationship between viruses and cellular life. Herein , we performed the first comprehensive analysis of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements ( MITEs) in the 5170 viral genomes for which sequences are currently available. Four hundred and fifty one copies of ten miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements ( MITEs) were found and each MITE had reached relatively large copy numbers ( some up to 90) in viruses. Eight MITEs belonging to two DNA superfamilies ( Our discovery highlights that TEs contribute to shape genome evolution of pandoraviruses. We concluded that as for cellular organisms , TEs are part of the pandoraviruses ' diverse mobilome.
