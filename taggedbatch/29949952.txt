 Synthetic biology is typified by developing novel genetic constructs from the assembly of reusable synthetic DNA parts , which contain one or more features such as promoters , ribosome binding sites , coding sequences and terminators. PartsGenie is introduced to facilitate the computational design of such synthetic biology parts , bridging the gap between optimization tools for the design of novel parts , the representation of such parts in community-developed data standards such as Synthetic Biology Open Language , and their sharing in journal-recommended data repositories. Consisting of a drag-and-drop web interface , a number of DNA optimization algorithms , and an interface to the well-used data repository JBEI ICE , PartsGenie facilitates the design , optimization and dissemination of reusable synthetic biology parts through an integrated application. PartsGenie is freely available at https://parts.synbiochem.co.uk.
