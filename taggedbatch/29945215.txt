 The TMEPAI family , composed of TMEPAI and C18ORF1 , is known to inhibit TGF-β ( transforming growth factor-β) signaling via its competition for binding of R-Smad ( receptor-regulated Smad) with SARA ( Smad anchor for receptor activation). However , TMEPAI has also been reported to be involved in AR ( androgen receptor) signaling , PTEN ( phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) signaling , and formation of autophagosomes in addition to degradation of TβRI ( TGF-β type I receptor) through lysosomes. Thus , TMEPAI seems to act as a regulator of multiple signaling pathways. A great deal of attention has already been paid to the relationship between the TMEPAI family and tumorigenicity. In this paper , therefore , we describe recent progresses in the understanding of how the TMEPAI family physiologically contributes to cellular functions and diseases.
