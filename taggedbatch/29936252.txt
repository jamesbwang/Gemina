 To verify the correlations between HbA1c and fasting glucose levels. A cross-sectional study with 14,249 Chinese subjects. Objective was evaluated in pooled , age-stratified , HbA1c and fasting glucose-stratified populations. In pooled populations , the Pearson correlation coefficients ( PCCs) of males and females were 0.684 ( P < 0.001) and 0.800 ( P < 0.001) , respectively. HbA1c and fasting glucose maintained significant correlations within the group with HbA1c < 6.5 % and glucose < 7.0 mmol/L and the group with HbA1c ≥ 6.5 % and glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L in both males ( PCC: 0.342 , P < 0.001; and PCC: 0.765 , P < 0.001 , respectively) and females ( PCC: 0.318 , P < 0.001 and PCC: 0.788 , P < 0.001 , respectively). The slopes increased from the group with HbA1c < 6.5 % and glucose < 7.0 mmol/L to the group with HbA1c ≥ 6.5 % and glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L in both males ( 0.26-0.44) and females ( 0.31-0.46). Linear regression analysis showed that fasting glucose and age were two common factors positively associated with HbA1C , and red blood cell count and red cell distribution width were two common factors negatively associated with HbA1c in both males and females with HbA1c < 6.5 % and glucose < 7.0 mmol/L. The correlations changed dramatically in the groups with HbA1c ≥ 6.5 % and glucose < 7.0 mmol/L and HbA1c < 6.5 % and glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L. High HbA1c and fasting glucose levels greatly altered the associations between HbA1c , glucose and age.
