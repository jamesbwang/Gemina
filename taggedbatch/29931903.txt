 To study the role and mechanism of myocardial apoptosis after short-term and long-term exercise preconditioning. Forty-eight male SD rats were randomly divided into control group ( C) , exhaust group ( E) , short-exercise preconditioning ( S-EP) and long-term exercise preconditioning group ( L-EP). Short-term and long-term exercise preconditioning were conducted for 3 days and 3 weeks of repeated intermittent swimming training program. The changes of myocardial cells were observed under light microscope. The serum levels of ischemia-modified albumin ( IMA) and creatine kinase-isoenzyme ( CK-MB) were detected by ELISA. Real time fluorescence quantitative PCR and Western blot were used to detect the expressions of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) , Caspase-8 , Caspase-3 genes and proteins in myocardial tissue. The apoptosis of cardiomyocytes was observed by TUNEL method. Compared with group C , group E had serious myocardial injury. The levels of serum IMA , CK-MB and the expressions of TNF-α , Caspase-8 and Caspase-3 in myocardium were increased ( Short-term and long-term exercise preconditioning can reduce myocardial injury after exhaustive exercise , but short-term exercise preconditioning does not alter the expression of Caspase protease. Long-term exercise preconditioning significantly inhibits Caspase-8 , 3 mRNA expression and reduces protein synthesis. The inhibitive effects of long-term exercise preconditioning on myocardial cell apoptosis were stronger than those of short-term exercise preconditioning.
