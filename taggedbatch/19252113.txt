 The purpose of this study was to analyze the characteristics and factors of voluntary discharged patients after suicide attempt and analyze the effectiveness of follow-up measures. Total 504 adult patients aged 14 years and over , who visited a local emergency medical center from September 1 , 2013 to December 31 , 2015 were enrolled and retrospectively reviewed. We analyzed the relationship with voluntary discharge group ( VDG) among basic characteristics , suicidal attempt variables , outcome variables related to suicide attempts , and treatment related variables comparing with normal discharge group ( NDG). Of the total 504 suicide attempts , three hundred eleven ( 61.7 %) patients were VDG and 193 ( 38.2 %) were NDG. The proportion of patients who completed the community service linkage were 18.7 % ( 36/193) in NDG , compared with 7.7 % ( 24/311) in VDG ( p < 0.05). In addition , the ratio of the patients who visited psychiatric outpatient department in NDG were 57.0 % ( 110/193) , more than four times as likely as 14.5 % ( 45/311) in VDG ( p < 0.05). Over sixty percent of suicide attempters discharged against medical advice. Further various aspects of national supportive measures including strengthening case management service should be considered.
