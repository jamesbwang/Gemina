 Neuropsychiatric symptoms following traumatic brain injury ( TBI) are common and contribute negatively to TBI outcomes by reducing overall quality of life. The development of neurobehavioral sequelae , such as concentration deficits , depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , fatigue<symptom> , and loss of emotional well-being has historically been attributed to an ambiguous `` post-concussive syndrome<disease><symptom> , '' considered secondary to frank structural injury and axonal damage. However , recent research suggests that neuroendocrine dysfunction , specifically hypopituitarism , plays an important role in the etiology of these symptoms. This post-head trauma hypopituitarism ( PHTH) has been shown in the past two decades to be a clinically prevalent phenomenon , and given the parallels between neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with non-TBI-induced hypopituitarism and those following TBI , it is now acknowledged that PHTH is likely a substantial contributor to these impairments. The current paper seeks to provide an overview of hypothesized pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neuroendocrine abnormalities after TBI , and to emphasize the significance of this phenomenon in the development of the neurobehavioral problems frequently seen after head trauma.
