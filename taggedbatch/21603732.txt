 One complication of an autogenous arteriovenous fistula<disease> ( AVF) for hemodialysis is the formation of a venous aneurysm<disease>. The treatment of a massive aneurysmal AVF generally involves ligation or resection with the use of prosthetic interposition. We present the case of a 46-year-old man in whom an AVF aneurysm<disease> was successfully treated by placating the excess free wall of the aneurysm<disease> with sutures. This method is a simple and effective intervention for managing aneurysm-associated complications. In addition , this approach helps to maintain the benefits of autogenous access while conserving future dialysis sites.
