 Over the past 30 years , the chromatographic fingerprint technology of traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM) has been developed from academic discussion to application for the research and development of TCM which has promoted the technological innovation of Chinese medicine industry and the progress of quality standard of TCM. The similarity evaluation method of chromatographic fingerprint of TCM has played a key role in this process. According to the number of literature and research tendency in terms of the chromatographic fingerprint in the last 30 years , the chromatographic fingerprint evaluation could be divided into three stages: the direct comparison stage ( 1988-1999) , similarity evaluation stage ( 2000-2009) and the similarity evaluation development stage ( 2010-2017). In this paper , the research progress of chromatographic fingerprints similarity evaluation of TCM in the last 30 years and its prospect were discussed , which may lead to a more mature stage for this method.
