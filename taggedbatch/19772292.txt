 We present a comparative study of plasmonic antennas fabricated by electron beam lithography and direct focused ion beam milling. We have investigated optical and structural properties and chemical composition of gold disc-shaped plasmonic antennas on a silicon nitride membrane fabricated by both methods to identify their advantages and disadvantages. Plasmonic antennas were characterized using transmission electron microscopy including electron energy loss spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy , and atomic force microscopy. We have found stronger plasmonic response with better field confinement in the antennas fabricated by electron beam lithography , which is attributed to their better structural quality , homogeneous thickness , and only moderate contamination mostly of organic nature. Plasmonic antennas fabricated by focused ion beam lithography feature weaker plasmonic response , lower structural quality with pronounced thickness fluctuations , and strong contamination , both organic and inorganic , including implanted ions from the focused beam. While both techniques are suitable for the fabrication of plasmonic antennas , electron beam lithography shall be prioritized over focused ion beam lithography due to better quality and performance of its products.
