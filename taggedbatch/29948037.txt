 Disuse and/or a non-weight-bearing condition changes muscle composition , with decreased skeletal muscle tissue and increased fat within ( intramuscular adipose tissue , IntraMAT) and between ( intermuscular adipose tissue , InterMAT) given muscles. Excessive adipose tissue contributes to dysfunctional and metabolically impaired<symptom> muscle. How these adipose tissues change during orthopedic treatment ( e.g. , cast immobilization , daily use of crutches) is not well documented. This study aimed to quantify changes in IntraMAT , InterMAT , and thigh and calf muscle tissue during orthopedic treatment. We studied 8 patients with fifth metatarsal bone or fibular fractures. The ankle joint involved underwent plaster casting for approximately 4 weeks , with crutches used during that time. Axial T1-weighted MRI at the mid-thigh and a 30 % proximal site at the calf were obtained to measure IntraMAT and InterMAT cross-sectional areas ( CSAs) and skeletal muscle tissue CSA before treatment and 4 weeks afterward. Thigh and calf muscle tissue CSAs were significantly decreased from before to after treatment: thigh , 85.8 ± 7.6 to 77.1 ± 7.3 cm The 4 weeks of treatment primarily induced skeletal muscle atrophy with less of an effect on IntraMAT or InterMAT. There is a risk of increasing IntraMAT relatively by decreasing skeletal muscle tissue size during orthopedic treatment.
