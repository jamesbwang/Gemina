 Individuals with congenital heart disease ( CHD) may be at higher risk of acquired cardiovascular disease than the general population due to their underlying physiology and/or surgical sequelae. We sought to assess the prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors in youth and adults with CHD. We assessed cardiovascular health as per the Cardiovascular Health in Ambulatory Care Research Team ( CANHEART) health index in patients with CHD aged 15 + years who attended cardiology outpatient clinics. Participants self-reported smoking behavior , fruit and vegetable consumption , physical activity , and whether they had diabetes and hypertension. Individual health indices were categorized into ideal/not ideal , and sum of individual health indices was categorized as poor , intermediate or ideal cardiovascular health as per CANHEART criteria. We included n = 102 adults ( 35.4 ± 12.9 years , 46 % female) and n = 88 youth ( 17.2 ± 1.1 years , 41 % female). Most individuals reported to be nonsmokers ( 88 % youth vs 86 % adults) and to consume ≥ 5 servings of fruit and vegetables per day ( 83 % vs 85 % , respectively). More adults than youth were overweight/obese ( 52 % vs 22 % , p < 0.001) though more adults than youth reported meeting age-specific physical activity guidelines ( 84 % vs 55 % , p < 0.001). According to CANHEART health index criteria , 32 % of youth and 27 % of adults were in ideal cardiovascular health. A low proportion of individuals with CHD are in ideal cardiovascular health , suggesting a need to promote healthy lifestyles during adolescence and throughout adulthood in these individuals.
