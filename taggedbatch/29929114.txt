 Equilibrium single-photon radionuclide imaging methods for assessing cardiac function and the integrity of the vascular system have long been in use for both clinical and research purposes. However , positron-emitting blood pool agents that could provide PET equivalents to these ( and other) clinical procedures have not yet been adopted despite technical imaging advantages offered by PET. Our goal was to develop a PET blood pool tracer that not only meets necessary in vivo biological requirements but can be produced with an uncomplicated and rapid synthesis method which would facilitate clinical translation. Herein , albumin labeled with fluorine-18 was synthesized using a one-pot method and evaluated in vitro and in vivo in rats. A ligand ( NODA-Bz-TFPE) , containing NODA attached to a tetrafluorophenylester ( TFPE) via a phenyl linker ( Bz) , was labeled with aluminum fluoride ( Al ( This synthesis exhibited an overall radiochemical yield of 45 Â± 10 % ( n = 30) , a 50-min radiolabeling time , a radiochemical purity > 99 % and apparent stability up to 4 h in human serum. Blood had the highest retention of Al ( A new ligand has been developed and radiolabeled with Al (
