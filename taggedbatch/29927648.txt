 There is growing interest in conducting public health research using data from social media. In particular , Twitter `` infoveillance '' has demonstrated utility across health contexts. However , rigorous and reproducible methodologies for using Twitter data in public health are not yet well articulated , particularly those related to content analysis , which is a highly popular approach. In 2014 , we gathered an interdisciplinary team of health science researchers , computer scientists , and methodologists to begin implementing an open-source framework for real-time infoveillance of Twitter health messages ( RITHM). Through this process , we documented common challenges and novel solutions to inform future work in real-time Twitter data collection and subsequent human coding. The RITHM framework allows researchers and practitioners to use well-planned and reproducible processes in retrieving , storing , filtering , subsampling , and formatting data for health topics of interest. Further considerations for human coding of Twitter data include coder selection and training , data representation , codebook development and refinement , and monitoring coding accuracy and productivity. We illustrate methodological considerations through practical examples from formative work related to hookah tobacco smoking , and we reference essential methods literature related to understanding and using Twitter data.
