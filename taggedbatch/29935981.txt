 To examine whether higher obesity level was associated with extensive staffing assistance ( from 2 or more persons) for completing activities of daily living ( ADL) among older nursing home residents. Retrospective cross-sectional study. US government-certified nursing homes. Medicare beneficiaries residing in a nursing home on April 1 , 2015. Exclusion criteria were age less than 65 years and body mass index ( BMI) below 18.5 ( underweight). Residents were divided by obesity level according to established BMI cutoffs , as follows: nonobese ( BMI = 18.5-29.9) or mild ( BMI = 30.0-34.9) , moderate ( BMI = 35.0-39.9) , or severe ( BMI â‰¥ 40) obesity. Level of staffing assistance for completing each of 10 ADL ( bed mobility , transfer , walking in room , walking in corridor , on- and off-unit locomotion , dressing , eating , toileting , and personal hygiene) was dichotomized as below 2 and 2 or more. Robust Poisson regression was used to test whether obesity conferred excess risk for needing 2 or more staff to complete each ADL. Adjusted models included individual-level covariates and nursing home fixed effects. A total of 1,063,383 nursing home residents were identified , including 309,263 ( 29.0 %) with obesity. Adjusted relative risks ( 95 % confidence intervals) for 2-person assistance with bed mobility associated with mild , moderate , and severe obesity were 1.17 ( 1.15 , 1.18) , 1.28 ( 1.25 , 1.31) , and 1.40 ( 1.36 , 1.43) , respectively. Adjusted relative risks for 2-person assistance with transferring associated with mild , moderate , and severe obesity were 1.15 ( 1.13 , 1.17) , 1.24 ( 1.22 , 1.27) , and 1.36 ( 1.33 , 1.39) , respectively. Obesity was associated with 2-person assistance for all other ADL except for eating. Higher obesity level was significantly associated with assistance from 2 or more staff for completing 9 of 10 ADL. Given increasing obesity rates in nursing homes , payment mechanisms that do not adjust for obesity or comprehensively account for excess ADL assistance may need revision to prevent adverse impacts on the long-term care system.
