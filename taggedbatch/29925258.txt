 G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs) mediate the majority of cellular responses to external stimuli. Upon activation by a ligand , the receptor binds to a partner heterotrimeric G protein and promotes exchange of GTP for GDP , leading to dissociation of the G protein into α and βγ subunits that mediate downstream signals. GPCRs can also activate distinct signaling pathways through arrestins. Active states of GPCRs form by small rearrangements of the ligand-binding , or orthosteric , site that are amplified into larger conformational changes. Molecular understanding of the allosteric coupling between ligand binding and G protein or arrestin interaction is emerging from structures of several GPCRs crystallized in inactive and active states , spectroscopic data , and computer simulations. The coupling is loose , rather than concerted , and agonist binding does not fully stabilize the receptor in an active conformation. Distinct intermediates whose populations are shifted by ligands of different efficacies underlie the complex pharmacology of GPCRs.
