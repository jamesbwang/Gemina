 Sulfasalazine ( SF) promotes remyelination and improves the outcome of multiple sclerosis ( MS) patients. However , the underlining mechanism remains elusive. Here , we examined whether SF blocks microglia switching to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype through a competing endogenous RNA ( ceRNA) effects in cuprizone-induced demyelination. The microglia reprogramming effects of SF in the mice model of cuprizone-induced demyelination was measured by histological , immunohistochemical and molecular biological methods. We also measured the effects of the condition media from SF-treated microglia on the differentiation of OLN-93 cells. Insights of the mechanism of ceRNAs of miR-136-5p and long non-coding RNA ( lncRNA) HOTAIR were gained from bioinformatic analysis , luciferase assays and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation. Microglia switched to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype in cuprizone induced-demyelination. Conversely , SF inhibited the M1-like polarization with the increased remyelination which was attenuated by microglia depletion. SF inhibited production of M1-like factors TNF-α and INF-γ in microglia , and thereby promoted the differentiation of OLN-93 oligodendrocytes. SF down-regulated lncRNA HOTAIR but up-regulated miR-136-5p , and thus inactivated AKT2-NF-κB in cuprizone-treated microglia. Importantly , lncRNA HOTAIR overexpression reversed the increased miR-136-5p expression by SF and thereby attenuated the inhibition of AKT2-mediated NF-κB activation. Mimic of miR-136-5p inhibited cuprizone-induced activation of AKT2-NF-κB in the microglia. In summary , SF blocks microglia switching to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype by ceRNA effect of miR-136-5p and lncRNA HOTAIR in cuprizone-induced demyelination. Our findings show the therapeutic potential of SF for human MS probably by targeting epigenetic regulation in microglia.
