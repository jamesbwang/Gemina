 The role of betrixaban in the prevention of venous thromboembolism ( VTE) in acutely medically ill patients and its efficacy and safety profiles are reviewed. Acutely medically ill patients have a high risk of developing VTE during hospitalization , and this risk continues into the postdischarge phase. Extended-duration betrixaban therapy has been evaluated in a large clinical trial ( the APEX trial) and in a meta-analysis of pooled data on acutely medically ill patients. These studies have shown positive outcomes when betrixaban was compared with conventional-duration subcutaneous enoxaparin therapy for prevention of VTE in acutely medically ill patients. In parallel with these results , oral betrixaban therapy was found to be associated with a rate of major bleeding comparable to that associated with subcutaneous enoxaparin therapy; however , betrixaban use was associated with a higher cumulative rate of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. In the APEX trial , the primary endpoint was not met in 1 of the prespecified cohorts , but betrixaban appeared to confer benefit in another cohort and in the overall study population. Certain populations of patients , including the elderly , are at high risk for bleeding ( mainly attributable to altered pharmacokinetics and polypharmacy); such patients are not appropriate candidates for extended-duration betrixaban therapy. Betrixaban can be a potential option for VTE prevention in medical patients; however , drug interaction potential and third-party coverage should be evaluated prior to prescribing. Betrixaban is an oral option for VTE prevention in medical patients.
