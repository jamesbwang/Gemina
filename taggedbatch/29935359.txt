 Natural lakes play a vital role as receiving system of a cocktail of antibiotics ( ABs) which have triggered a major health concern. The comparisons of ABs concentrations have been substantially implemented throughout the worldwide range. However , from lake management , the questions are not yet adequately solved: `` when and where does the overall pollution level of ABs present more serious , and what AB species dominate ''. In this study , we detected 22 ABs in water column and sediment bottom in Taihu Lake Basin in January , April , July and October in 2017. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling ( NMDS) was applied to characterize spatiotemporal dissimilarity of ABs concentrations. Combined with a method of summed standardized concentrations , analysis of variance was applied to evaluate the overall pollution level of ABs at different sites and time periods , instead of , traditionally , a comparison of concentration. The results showed that 90 % CI of Macrolides , Sulfonamides , Tetracyclines and Quinolones were 0.020-5.646 , 0.040-7.887 , 0.100-13.308 and 0.130-9.631 ng/L in water column , respectively; and 0.005-1.532 , 0.002-0.120 , 0.010-0.902 and 0.006-3.972 Î¼g/kg in sediment , respectively. ABs concentrations approximately presented spatial homogeneity in the whole basin which included all main inflow rivers , outflow rivers and the lake body itself. Species composition was seasonally distinct and the overall pollution level was significantly lower in autumn. A critical body residue analysis showed that ABs concentrations presented a neglectable cumulative risk for fish species. This research added to the body of knowledge to develop pollution management strategies on point and non-point source loads for Taihu Lake Basin , and also the methodology provided reference for spatiotemporal characterization of dissolved pollutant in other water bodies.
