 The objective of this retrospective analysis of the longitudinal Millennium Cohort Study was to examine whether maternal alcohol consumption in pregnancy ( MACP) is associated with the development of childhood autism spectrum disorders ( ASD). Data on MACP and ASD were obtained from parental questionnaires. There were 18,168 singleton mother-child pairs with data on MACP , and 12,595 answered the question on ASD when the children were 11 years old. No statistically significant association was found between MACP and ASD for light ( OR 0.78 , 95 % CI 0.48-1.29) , moderate ( OR 0.89 , 95 % CI 0.35-2.27) , or heavy ( OR 1.54 , 95 % CI 0.56-4.21) MACP. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy was not associated with the risk of developing ASD in this study cohort.
