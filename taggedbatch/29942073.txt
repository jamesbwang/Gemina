 Since the discovery of the human pathogen Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> , various other Helicobacter<pathogen> species have been identified in the stomach of domesticated and wild mammals. To better understand the evolutionary history of these ecologically similar but genetically distinct species , we analyzed 108 gastric Helicobacter genomes and included 54 enterohepatic Helicobacter genomes for comparison purposes. An admixture analysis supported the presence of an ecological barrier , preventing the genetic exchange between the gastric and enterohepatic Helicobacter<pathogen> species , and unraveled many gene flow events within and across species residing in the stomach. As pets can be colonized by multiple gastric Helicobacter<pathogen> species , the genetic exchange between the canine and feline strains was evident , with H.<pathogen> heilmannii<pathogen> and H.<pathogen> bizzozeronii<pathogen> showing the highest interspecies recombination. An admixture between H.<pathogen> pylori ( in particular , the ancestral African strains) , H. acinonychis from wild felines and H. cetorum from marine mammals was also identified. Because these latter species do not share the same host , this phenomenon is most likely a remaining signal of shared ancestry. A reconstruction of the time of divergence of the gastric Helicobacter spp. revealed that the domestic animal-related Helicobacter<pathogen> species evolved in parallel with H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> and its two closest relatives ( H. acinonychis and H. cetorum) , rather than together.
