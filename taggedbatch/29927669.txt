 Although proactive personality ( Bateman & Crant , 1993) , as a relatively stable disposition to bring about change in one 's environment , is a central construct in the management and organizational behavior literature , questions have arisen about its definition and structure. To answer these questions , we present a tripartite model of proactive personality consisting of 3 dimensions: perception ( i.e. , perceiving opportunities for change) , implementation ( i.e. , planning and executing change) , and perseverance ( i.e. , persisting until the change is realized). Exploratory factor analysis informed the construction of a 14-item scale , and confirmatory factor analyses supported the validity of the scale. The new scale demonstrated satisfactory reliability and accounted for significant variance in task performance above that of original proactive personality , personal initiative , conscientiousness , and social desirability. Tripartite proactive personality might provide a more nuanced view of dispositional proactivity and greater predictive power than the original unidimensional proactive personality.
