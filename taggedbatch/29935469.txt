 The Fundão dam collapsed releasing 60 million tons of mining waste into the environment. The mining wastes should be better studied , since some of them are deposited on the alluvial plains soil and at the bottom of the rivers , like sediments , of the region affected. Thus , this work aims to perform the chemical , physical and adsorptive characterization of the samples colleted in region de Paracatu de Baixo. The mining waste has uneven surface , with sizes ranging from 2 to 200 μm , pHPCZ in 6.0. Are composed predominantly by kaolinite , goethite , hematite , gibbsite and quartz. It has been classified as non-hazardous residues. The adsorption studies showed the mining waste have a low Cationic Exchange Capacity. The sorption process was occurs by ion exchange and the kinetics follows the pseudo second order model ( R
