 Chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) modified T cells are being investigated in many settings including classical Hodgkin lymphoma ( cHL). The unique biology of cHL , characterized by scant Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg ( HRS) cells within an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment ( TME) , may pose challenges for cellular therapies directly targeting antigens expressed on HRS. We hypothesized that eradicating CD19 positive ( +) B<pathogen> cells within the TME and the putative circulating CD19 + HRS clonotypic cells using anti-CD19 directed CAR modified T cells ( CART19) may indirectly affect HRS cells , which do not express CD19. Here we describe our pilot trial using CART19 in patients with relapsed and refractory cHL. To limit potential toxicities , we used non-viral RNA CART19 cells which are expected to express CAR protein only a few days , as opposed to CART19 generated by viral vector transduction , which expand in vivo and retain CAR expression. All 5 enrolled patients underwent successful manufacturing of non-viral RNA CART19 and 4 were infused with protocol specified cell dose. There were no severe toxicities. Responses were seen , but these were transient. To our knowledge , this is the first CART19 clinical trial to use non-viral RNA gene delivery. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02277522 ( adult<disease>) and NCT02624258 ( pediatric).
