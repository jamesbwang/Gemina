 In the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study ( CANVAS) Program , canagliflozin reduced the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events and the results suggested a renal benefit in patients with type 2 diabetes who were at high risk for cardiovascular events , compared with those treated with placebo. Here we report the results of a prespecified exploratory analysis of the long-term effects of canagliflozin on a range of sustained and adjudicated renal outcomes. The CANVAS Program consists of two double-blind , randomised trials that assessed canagliflozin versus placebo in participants with type 2 diabetes who were at high risk of cardiovascular events , done at 667 centres in 30 countries. People with type 2 diabetes and an HbA Between Nov 17 , 2009 , and March 7 , 2011 ( CANVAS) , and Jan 17 , 2014 , and May 29 , 2015 ( CANVAS-R) , 15 494 people were screened , of whom 10 142 participants ( with a baseline mean eGFR 76 · 5 mL/min per 1 · 73 m In a prespecified exploratory analysis , canagliflozin treatment was associated with a reduced risk of sustained loss of kidney function , attenuated eGFR decline , and a reduction in albuminuria , which supports a possible renoprotective effect of this drug in people with type 2 diabetes.
