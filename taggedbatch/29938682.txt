 Electroencephalography ( EEG) provides no direct link between electrode positions and underlying signal generators. Inferences based on spatial proximity between scalp positions and cortical structures are not reliable. More accurate source localization is obtained by solving both the forward and the inverse problem , but is technically challenging. In this paper , we provide a reference table of correspondence between EEG sensors and cortical anatomical regions based on a realistic head model. We also present a universal algorithm to compute the solution by using a forward model to determine the sensitivity for electrodes of any defined electrode positioning system and cortical anatomical parcellation.
