 The fascinating chromosomal cycle leading to facultative heterochromatization in the mealybugs has been a challenging system for mechanistic understanding of the phenomenon of genomic imprinting and epigenetics. The elegant cytological dissection of the various processes reported in the literature is equally fascinating for the researchers of current molecular age. Presently , a two way approach is being pursued; continued efforts of utilizing elegant cytology , in combination with the molecular probes to decipher molecular correlates on one hand and on the other , the
