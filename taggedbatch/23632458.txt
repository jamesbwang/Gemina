 Prenatal stress ( PS) induces molecular changes that alter neural connectivity , increasing the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we analyzed- in the hippocampus of adult rats exposed to PS- the epigenetic signature mediating the PS-induced neuroplasticity changes. Furthermore , using cultured hippocampal neurons , we investigated the effects on neuroplasticity of an epigenetic modulator. PS induced significant modifications in the mRNA levels of stress-related transcription factor MEF2A , SUV39H1 histone methyltransferase , and TET1 hydroxylase , indicating that PS modifies gene expression through chromatin remodeling. In in vitro analysis , histone acetylation inhibition with apicidin increased filopodium density , suggesting that the external regulation of acetylation levels might modulate neuronal morphology. These results offer a way to enhance neural connectivity that could be considered to revert PS effects.
