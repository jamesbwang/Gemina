 Urinary copper excretion rates and non-caeruloplasmin associated copper concentrations are increased in patients with Wilson disease. However , there is little literature describing the monitoring of these parameters over the long term. This is a monocentric retrospective study including data collected between 2003 and 2015 from 321 patients with Wilson disease by chart review. The patients were under therapy with D-penicillamine , trientine , or zinc. 24-h urinary copper excretion rates , non-caeruloplasmin associated copper , and total serum copper concentrations were determined at the start of therapy , as well as 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 , and â‰¥ 60 months after the start of therapy. For patients taking chelating agents , all parameters were measured while under continued therapy , as well as after a 48-h dose interruption. A mathematical formula to predict 24-h urinary copper excretion rates under different therapies was established. In all treatment groups , urinary copper excretion rates decreased over time , but the inter-individual variation of the results was high. Non-caeruloplasmin associated copper concentrations tended to decline over time , but with a higher variation of results than that observed for urinary copper excretion rates. Due to their variability , urinary copper excretion rates and serum copper concentrations are less than ideal parameters by which to monitor the benefit of a copper-reducing therapy. Urinary copper excretion rates seem to be more suitable than non-caeruloplasmin associated copper concentrations for this purpose.
