 The abnormal self-assembly of the amyloid- & beta; peptide into toxic & beta;- rich aggregates can cause Alzheimer & rsquo; s disease. Recently , it has been shown that small gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs) inhibit A & beta; aggregation and fibrillation by slowing down the nucleation process in experimental studies. However , the effects of AuNPs on A & beta; oligomeric structures are still unclear. In this study , we investigate the conformation of A & beta; ( 16-22) tetramers/octamers in the absence and presence of AuNPs using extensive all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Our studies demonstrate that the addition of AuNPs into A & beta; ( 16-22) solution prevents & beta;- sheet formation , and the inhibition depends on the concentration of A & beta; ( 16-22) peptides. A detailed analysis of the A & beta; ( 16-22)/ A & beta; ( 16-22)/ water/AuNPs interactions reveals that AuNPs inhibit the & beta;- sheet formation resulting from the same physical forces: hydrophobic interactions. Overall , our computational study provides evidence that AuNPs are likely to inhibit A & beta; ( 16-22) and full-length A & beta; fibrillation. Thus , this work provides theoretical insights into the development of inorganic nanoparticles as drug candidates for treatment of AD.
