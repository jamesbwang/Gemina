 Monofluoroacetic acid ( FAcOH) , was once widely used in baits as a rodenticide in agriculture. For intentional and unintentional misuses , the incidence of FAcOH poisoning<disease> has increased in recent years. Organic fluorine rodenticides such as sodium monofluoroacetate and monofluoroacetamide , the analogs of FAcOH , can easily be converted to FAcOH in vivo and cause injury. It is urgent to establish a simple and sensitive analytical method of FAcOH in human plasma and applied to clinical poison analysis. In this paper , an ultra-fast liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( UFLC-MS/MS) method was developed for determination of FAcOH in patient plasma. We used isotopic labelled FAcOH-
