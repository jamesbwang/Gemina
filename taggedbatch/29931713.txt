 Spin-orbit torque ( SOT)- induced magnetization switching exhibits chirality ( clockwise or counterclockwise) , which offers the prospect of programmable spin-logic devices integrating nonvolatile spintronic memory cells with logic functions. Chirality is usually fixed by an applied or effective magnetic field in reported studies. Herein , utilizing an in-plane magnetic layer that is also switchable by SOT , the chirality of a perpendicular magnetic layer that is exchange-coupled with the in-plane layer can be reversed in a purely electrical way. In a single Hall bar device designed from this multilayer structure , three logic gates including AND , NAND , and NOT are reconfigured , which opens a gateway toward practical programmable spin-logic devices.
