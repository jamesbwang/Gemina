 Animal models for examining human breast cancer ( HBC) carcinogenesis have been extensively studied and proposed. With the recent advent of immunotherapy , significant attention has been focused on the dog as a model for human cancer. Dogs develop mammary tumors and other cancer types spontaneously with an intact immune system , which exhibit a number of clinical and molecular similarities to HBC. In addition to the spontaneous tumor presentation , the clinical similarities between human and canine mammary tumors ( CMT) include the age at onset , hormonal etiology and course of the diseases. Furthermore , factors that affect the disease outcome , including tumor size , stage and lymph node invasion , are similar in HBC and CMT. Similarly , the molecular characteristics of steroid receptor , epidermal growth factor , proliferation marker , metalloproteinase and cyclooxygenase expression , and the mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in CMT , mimic HBC. Furthermore , ductal carcinomas
