 The number of cancer survivors is exponentially increasing worldwide , due to both advances in cancer detection and treatment strategies , as well as the aging and growth of the population. This decrease in cancer mortality has brought forth a concurrent increase of non-ischemic ( toxic) dilated cardiomyopathy in the survivor population , also known as cancer therapeutics-induced cardiomyopathy ( CTIC). The optimal pharmacological management for this condition is still elusive , and hence , the focus of this work. Our review of the literature did not identify any prospective randomized clinical trial of CTIC in adult cancer survivors , neither published nor in progress. However , available data seem to suggest that , when managed with standard guideline-derived medical therapy , the outcomes of CTIC are comparable to that of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy ( IDC). Nonetheless , the evidence behind this strategy is inadequate. Until new information becomes available , pharmacological management of CTIC must parallel that of IDC. However , implementation of such may be hindered by other cancer therapeutics-induced comorbidities and conditioned by the particular effects of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> pharmacotherapy on cancer outcomes. This work succinctly reviews these three areas , in the context of adult cancer survivors.
