 Here we identified that BTE ( black tea extract) , within the studied concentration range , is more effective than GTE ( green tea extract) in protecting C. elegans<pathogen> against hypertonic stress , by enhancing survival after exposure to various salts , and alleviating suffered motility loss and body shrinkage. The mechanism of such protection may be due to the ability of black tea to induce the conserved WNK/GCK signaling pathway and down-regulation of the expression levels of nlp-29. Intriguingly , black tea does not relieve hypertonicity-induced protein damage. The findings implicate the potential health benefits of black tea consumed worldwide.
