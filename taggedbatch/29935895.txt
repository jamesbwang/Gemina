 Carmi syndrome<disease><symptom> is a rare genetic disorder characterized by junctional epidermolysis bullosa ( JEB) and pyloric atresia ( PA). We reviewed the clinicopathologic and molecular features of patients with Carmi syndrome<disease><symptom> to identify predictors of clinical outcome and guide surgical PA repair. A PRISMA-compliant systematic literature review of PubMed , CINAHL , and the Cochrane Library was performed. 63 original studies including a total of 100 patients were included. PA type 1 and 2 were equally prevalent ( 47.2 % , 95 % CI: 34.4-60.3). Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty ( 96 % , 95 % CI: 78.8-99) and gastroduodenostomy ( 72 % , 95 % CI: 52.2-85.9) were the most common type 1 and 2 PA repairs , respectively. Seventy lethal cases were identified ( 74.5 % , 95 % CI: 64.8-83.5). Of the 73 patients that received an operation , 49 died ( 67.1 % , 95 % CI: 55.7-76.8) and 24 survived ( 32.9 % , 95 % CI: 23.2-44.3). Integrin α6β4 expression was absent or markedly reduced in lethal cases. Integrin α6 , plectin-1 , cephalic integrin β4 ( exon 3 to intron 11) , and premature termination codon mutations were also associated with poor prognosis. Although Carmi syndrome<disease><symptom> typically has poor prognosis , 1 in 4 patients exhibits nonlethal phenotypes. Immunofluorescence mapping and genetic consultation can guide surgical intervention and provide valuable family planning information. Prognosis study , Level IV.
