 Candida<pathogen> parapsilosis<pathogen> is a common agent of fungaemia , but few outbreaks of Candida<pathogen> parapsilosis<pathogen> infection have been reported in China. To elaborate an outbreak of nosocomial Candida<pathogen> parapsilosis<pathogen> sensu stricto fungaemia in a neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU) of a comprehensive hospital in China from July to October 2017. Epidemics and characteristics of fungaemia cases were investigated. Surveillance samples were collected. Vitek 2 Compact System , internal transcribed spacer sequencing , and random amplified polymorphic DNA ( RAPD) typing were conducted to identify the isolates. Antifungal susceptibility test was performed for all bloodstream isolates. Sixteen neonates were diagnosed as Candida<pathogen> parapsilosis<pathogen> sensu stricto fungaemia during this period. Presenting symptoms included leucopenia , thrombocytopenia<symptom> , and respiratory crackles. Fifteen cases were cured whereas one case who suffered from severe concomitant diseases died. The isolates were susceptible to fluconazole , amphotericin B , itraconazole , voriconazole , and 5-fluorocytosine. A total of 313 surveillance samples were collected , and Candida<pathogen> parapsilosis<pathogen> sensu stricto was identified from 16 environmental samples and one sample from an ultrasonographer 's hand. The colonized locations included wiping cloths , faucets , sinks , operating table , puddles in the bathroom , a ventilator , and an ultrasonic probe. The RAPD patterns of all the Candida<pathogen><pathogen> parapsilosis<pathogen> sensu stricto isolates from bloodstream and surveillance samples were identical. The outbreak was controlled after a series of infection control measures. Contaminated environment was associated with this outbreak. Close attention to immunocompromised patients , thorough environmental disinfection and hand hygiene should be strengthened in NICU.
