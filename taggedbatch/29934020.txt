 The aim of this study was to prospectively examine the impact of a tablet-based curriculum on the radiology resident educational experience. A comprehensive tablet-based curriculum was developed by creating subspecialty modules with appropriate content level for each required rotation at our diagnostic radiology residency program. Daily assignments included key learning points , readings , and reference presentation slides , covering all objectives published by the ABR Core Exam Study Guide. Residents were provided with iPad devices preconfigured with the curriculum and online access to most major radiology textbooks available in our institutional digital library. Assessment surveys were administered at baseline and 12 months following curriculum implementation. Twenty-two residents completed both surveys. In comparing the pre versus postsurvey results , 32 % versus 73 % residents agreed or strongly agreed that study resources were well-organized , 41 % versus 91 % agreed or strongly agreed that study resources were easily accessible , 27 % versus 77 % agreed or strongly agreed that the modules encouraged active learning , 18 % versus 82 % agreed or strongly agreed that resources motivate them to study daily , 36 % versus 82 % agreed or strongly agreed that the resources adequately prepared the resident for the radiology board exam , and 36 % versus 82 % agreed or strongly agreed that they were satisfied with the resources provided by the residency program ( p < 0.05). Our study demonstrated the positive impact of implementing a complete tablet-based curriculum on radiology resident motivation , satisfaction , and engagement. Use of mobile tablet devices has the potential to dramatically transform content delivery in residency education.
