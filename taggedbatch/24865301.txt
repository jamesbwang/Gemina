 Establish normative data for tympanic electrocochleography ( TM ECochG) parameters in normal hearing adults without Ménière 's disease 's ( MD) symptoms. Describe TM ECochG variables that help to distinguish normal from MD ears<disease>. We enrolled 100 subjects ( N = 200 ears<disease>) , 59 females , aged between 19 and 71 years from 09/2010 to 04/2014. Inclusion criteria: normal otomicroscopy , hearing thresholds ≤ 25 dB nHL from 250 to 4000 Hz , normal tympanogram , no symptoms of MD according to the AAO-HNS 1995 criteria and Gibson 's score < 7. We excluded subjects with dizziness<symptom> , aural fullness or other symptoms of endolymphatic hydrops. The following parameters were analyzed: SP/AP amplitude ratio , SP/AP area ratio and the difference between AP latency with rarefaction and condensation stimuli. There was no significant difference between right and left ears<disease> ( Intraclass correlation coefficient < 0.6). SP/AP amplitude ratio varied between 0.084 and 0.356 and SP/AP area ratio between 0.837 and 1.671 ( percentiles 5 and 95). The AP latency difference to rarefaction and condensation clicks was between 0.0 and 0.333 ms. Normative data for TM ECochG parameters were established in 100 normal hearing subjects without MD.. These data can be used to distinguish normal from pathological findings and in follow-up of MD patients.
