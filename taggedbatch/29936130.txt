 To improve efficiency , convenience , and cost , a prospective phase II trial was initiated to evaluate accelerated partial breast irradiation delivered with noninvasive image-guided breast brachytherapy ( NIBB) via five once-daily fractions. Women ≥ 50 years old with early-stage breast cancer undergoing breast conserving surgery were enrolled. Eligibility criteria included invasive carcinoma ≤ 2.0 cm or ductal carcinoma in situ ≤ 3.0 cm , ER positive ( if invasive) , lymph node negative , LVI absent , and margins negative by 2 mm. Patients received a total dose of 28.5 Gy in five daily fractions. NIBB was delivered using two orthogonal axes for each fraction. Applicators were selected to encompass the lumpectomy cavity with a 1.0 cm clinical target volume margin and 0 to 0.5 cm planning target volume margin. Acute and late toxicity was assessed based on CTCAE v3 .0. Forty patients with a mean age of 67 years underwent protocol treatment. Mean tumor size was 1.0 cm ( 0.3-2.0 cm). Eighty percent had invasive carcinoma and the remainder had ductal carcinoma in situ. Mean tumor bed volume was 21 cc ( 5-79 cc) and mean breast volume was 1319 cc ( 499-3044 cc). Mean breast separation with compression was 6.7 cm ( 3.5-8.9 cm). All patients tolerated well. Median discomfort with compression was 1 ( range: 0-7) on a 10-point pain scale. Acute skin reaction was Grade 0-1 in 70 % , Grade 2 in 28 % , and Grade 3 in 3 %. Acute skin toxicity was not associated with breast size but was associated with larger breast separation with compression ( p < 0.01) and larger applicator size ( p < 0.01). No Grade 3 + late toxicity or local recurrences have been observed at a median followup of 14 months. Accelerated partial breast irradiation delivered using NIBB over five daily fractions is a convenient treatment option that is feasible and well tolerated.
