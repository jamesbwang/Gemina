 With the emerging primary resistance of Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> to current drugs and wide distribution of latent tuberculosis<disease> infection , the need for new compounds with a novel mode of action is growing. Copper-mediated innate immunity and its antibacterial toxicity pose novel strategies for tuberculosis<disease> drug discovery and development. Transcriptome response to 1-hydroxy-5-R-pyridine-2 ( 1H)- thiones , which were found to be highly active in vitro against actively growing and dormant nonculturable M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> , revealed signs of copper toxicity. 1-Hydroxy-5-R-pyridine-2 ( 1H)- thiones were found to form stable charged lipophilic complexes with Cu2 + ions that could transport into mycobacterial cells. Copper accumulated inside treated bacilli as subsequent metabolic destruction of the complex led to chemical transformation of 1-hydroxy-5-R-pyridine-2 ( 1H)- thiones and release of free Cu2 + into the cytoplasm. 1-Hydroxy-5-R-pyridine-2 ( 1H)- thiones are a potent class of Cu-dependent inhibitors of M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> , and may control infection by impairment of copper homeostasis.
