 Most double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA) viruses<pathogen> transcribe RNA plus strands within a common innermost capsid shell. This process requires coordinated efforts by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRp) together with other capsid proteins and genomic RNA. Here we report the near-atomic resolution structure of the RdRp protein VP2 in complex with its cofactor protein VP4 and genomic RNA within an aquareovirus capsid using 200-kV cryoelectron microscopy and symmetry-mismatch reconstruction. The structure of these capsid proteins enabled us to observe the elaborate nonicosahedral structure within the double-layered icosahedral capsid. Our structure shows that the RdRp complex is anchored at the inner surface of the capsid shell and interacts with genomic dsRNA and four of the five asymmetrically arranged N termini of the capsid shell proteins under the fivefold axis , implying roles for these N termini in virus assembly. The binding site of the RNA end at VP2 is different from the RNA cap binding site identified in the crystal structure of orthoreovirus RdRp λ3 , although the structures of VP2 and λ3 are almost identical. A loop , which was thought to separate the RNA template and transcript , interacts with an apical domain of the capsid shell protein , suggesting a mechanism for regulating RdRp replication and transcription. A conserved nucleoside triphosphate binding site was localized in our RdRp cofactor protein VP4 structure , and interactions between the VP4 and the genomic RNA were identified.
