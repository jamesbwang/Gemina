 The systemic delivery of drugs to the body via circulation after oral administration is a preferred method of drug administration during cancer treatment given its ease of implementation. However , the physicochemical properties of many current anticancer drugs limit their effectiveness when delivered by systemic routes. The use of nanoparticles ( NPs) has emerged as an effective means of overcoming the inherent limitations of systemic drug delivery. We provide herein an overview of various NP formulations that facilitate improvements in the efficacy of various anticancer drugs compared with the free drug. This review will be useful to the reader who is interested in the role NP technology is playing in shaping the future of chemotherapeutic drug delivery and disease treatment.
