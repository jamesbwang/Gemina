 Global matching models have provided an important theoretical framework for recognition memory. Key predictions of this class of models are that ( 1) increasing the number of occurrences in a study list of some items affects the performance on other items ( list-strength effect) and that ( 2) adding new items results in a deterioration of performance on the other items ( list-length effect). Experimental confirmation of these predictions has been difficult , and the results have been inconsistent. A review of the existing literature , however , suggests that robust length and strength effects do occur when sufficiently similar hard-to-label items are used. In an effort to investigate this further , we had participants study lists containing one or more members of visual scene categories ( bathrooms , beaches , etc.). Experiments 1 and 2 replicated and extended previous findings showing that the study of additional category members decreased accuracy , providing confirmation of the category-length effect. Experiment 3 showed that repeating some category members decreased the accuracy of nonrepeated members , providing evidence for a category-strength effect. Experiment 4 eliminated a potential challenge to these results. Taken together , these findings provide robust support for global matching models of recognition memory. The overall list lengths , the category sizes , and the number of repetitions used demonstrated that scene categories are well-suited to testing the fundamental assumptions of global matching models. These include ( A) interference from memories for similar items and contexts , ( B) nondestructive interference , and ( C) that conjunctive information is made available through a matching operation.
