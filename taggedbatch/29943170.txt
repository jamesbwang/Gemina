 Survivors of childhood cancer require life-long outpatient healthcare , which may be impacted by health insurance. This study sought to understand survivors ' utilization of outpatient healthcare provider services. The study examined cross-sectional survey data using an age-stratified sample from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study of self-reported annual use of outpatient services. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors associated with utilization of services. Six hundred ninety-eight survivors were surveyed , median age 36.3 years ( range 22.2-62.6) , median time from diagnosis 28.8 years ( range 23.1-41.7). Almost all ( 93 %) of survivors had at least one outpatient visit during the previous year; 81.3 % of these visits were with a primary care providers ( PCP) , 54.5 % were with specialty care physicians , 30.3 % were with nurse practitioner/physician 's assistants ( NP/PA) , and 14.2 % were with survivorship clinic providers. Survivors with severe to life-threatening chronic health conditions had greater odds of utilizing a specialty care physician ( OR = 5.15 , 95 % CI 2.89-9.17) or a survivorship clinic ( OR = 2.93 , 95 % CI 1.18-7.26) than those with no chronic health conditions. Having health insurance increased the likelihood of seeking care from NP/PA ( private , OR = 2.76 , 95 % CI 1.37-5.58; public , OR = 2.09 , 95 % CI 0.85-5.11) , PCP ( private , OR = 7.82 , 95 % CI 3.80-13.10; public , OR = 7.24 , 95 % CI 2.75-19.05) , and specialty care ( private , OR = 2.96 , 95 % CI 1.48-5.94; public , OR = 2.93 , 95 % CI 1.26-6.84) compared to without insurance. Most childhood cancer survivors received outpatient care from a PCP , but a minority received care from a survivorship clinic provider. Having health insurance increased the likelihood of outpatient care. Targeted interventions in the primary care setting may improve risk-based , survivor-focused care for this vulnerable population.
