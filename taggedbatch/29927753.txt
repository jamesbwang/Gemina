 To compare the functional optical zone ( OZ) with different levels of myopia and different OZ groups after small-incision lenticule extraction. This retrospective study included 249 patients ( 120 men) after small-incision lenticule extraction correction. We grouped participants according to attempted correction ( low: spherical equivalent ( SE) > -3.0 D; moderate: -6.0 D ≥ SE ≥ -3.0 D; high: SE ≥ -6.0 D) and planned functional optical zone ( PFOZ) ( OZ-1: PFOZ ≤ 6.3 mm; OZ-2: 6.3 mm < PFOZ ≤ 6.5; OZ-3: PFOZ > 6.5 mm) , and we compared the achieved functional optical zone ( AFOZ) and total corneal aberration , using Scheimpflug imaging , 1 month postoperatively. Correlations between corneal aberration and AFOZ were analyzed. The AFOZ was smaller than the PFOZ in all 3 refraction groups ( reduction: low , 0.78 ± 0.72 mm; moderate , 1.22 ± 0.60 mm; and high: 1.49 ± 0.58 mm , P < 0.001). There was no difference in the AFOZ among the 3 OZ groups. Total corneal aberration increased more in the high myopia group ( total higher-order aberration , coma<symptom> , and spherical aberration , P < 0.001) , which also correlated with the AFOZ. The discrepancy between the AFOZ and PFOZ increased with greater attempted correction. Attempted correction and AFOZ influence corneal aberration.
