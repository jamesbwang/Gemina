 Natriuretic peptides ( NPs) are important hormones that regulate multiple cellular functions including cardiovascular physiology. In the heart , two natriuretic peptide receptors NPR1 and NPR2 act as membrane guanylyl cyclases to produce 3 ' ,5 '- cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP). Although both receptors protect from cardiac hypertrophy , their effects on contractility are markedly different , from little effect ( NPR1) to pronounced negative inotropic and positive lusitropic responses ( NPR2) with unclear underlying mechanisms. Here we use a scanning ion conductance microscopy ( SICM) approach combined with FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET)- based cGMP biosensors to show that whereas NPR2 is uniformly localised on the cardiomyocyte membrane , functional NPR1 receptors are found exclusively in membrane invaginations called transverse ( T)- tubules. This leads to far-reaching CNP/NPR2/cGMP signals , whereas ANP/NPR1/cGMP signals are highly confined to T-tubular microdomains by local pools of phosphodiesterase 2. This provides a previously unrecognised molecular basis for clearly distinct functional effects engaged by different cGMP producing membrane receptors.
