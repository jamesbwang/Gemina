 All-polymer solar cells ( all-PSCs) composed of conjugated polymers as both donor and acceptor components in bulk heterojunction photoactive layers have attracted increasing attention. However , it is a big challenge to achieve optimal morphology in polymer: polymer blends. In response , we report herein a new strategy to adjust the nanoscale organization for all-PSCs. Specifically , side chain engineering of the well-known naphthalene diimide ( NDI)- based polymer N2200 is modulated by introducing a fraction of linear oligoethylene oxide ( OE) side chains to replace branched alkyl chains on the NDI units and by synthesizing a series of NDI-based polymer acceptors NOE x , where x is the percentage of OE chain substituted NDI units relative to total NDI units. Compared to the reference polymer NOE0 , OE-chain-containing polymer NOE10 offers a much higher power conversion efficiency ( PCE) of 8.1 % with a record high fill factor ( FF) of 0.75 in all-PSCs. Moreover , the NOE10-based all-PSC exhibits excellent long-term and thermal stabilities with > 97 % of the initial PCE being maintained after 300 h of aging at 65 Â°C. This work demonstrates an effective morphology optimization strategy to achieve highly efficient and stable all-PSCs and shows the excellent potential of NOE10 as an alternative to commercially available acceptor polymers N2200.
