 Despite considerable research effort , the natural hydrogels presently available for tissue engineering suffer from several major drawbacks , one of the significant issue is their poor mechanical strength which are unable to satisfy some mechanical requirements for successful outcomes. Herein , to mimic the composition and structure of the natural extracellular matrix , the micron-sized silk fibers obtained by alkaline hydrolysis were used as a reinforcement phase in a GelMA hydrogel , resulting in a material with significantly greater stiffness than pure GelMA hydrogel alone. In addition , the hydrogel demonstrated tunable compressive strength , swelling capacity , and degradation properties based on the silk fiber length. Experiments with cells indicated that MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts quickly adhered to and proliferated on the surface of the composite hydrogels , as revealed by FDA/PI staining and CCK-8 assays. In addition , various cellular responses , including cell adhesion , changes in cellular morphology and cell proliferation behavior , occurred on the composite hydrogel and varied with fiber length. Overall , this study introduces a series of fiber-reinforced , tunable composite hydrogels that could be useful for various tissue engineering applications.
