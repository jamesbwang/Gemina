 Puerarin suppresses autophagy to alleviate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury , and accumulating evidence indicates that the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway regulates the activation of the autophagy pathway through the coordinated phosphorylation of ULK1. In this study , we investigated the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of puerarin and its role in modulating autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Rats were intraperitoneally injected with puerarin , 50 or 100 mg/kg , daily for 7 days. Then , 30 minutes after the final administration , rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion for 90 minutes. Then , after 24 hours of reperfusion , the Longa score and infarct volume were evaluated in each group. Autophagosome formation was observed by transmission electron microscopy. LC3 , Beclin-1 p62 , AMPK , mTOR and ULK1 protein expression levels were examined by immunofluorescence and western blot assay. Puerarin substantially reduced the Longa score and infarct volume , and it lessened autophagosome formation in the hippocampal CA1 area following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with puerarin ( 50 or 100 mg/kg) reduced Beclin-1 expression and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio , as well as p-AMPK and pS317-ULK1 levels. In comparison , it increased p62 expression. Furthermore , puerarin at 100 mg/kg dramatically increased the levels of p-mTOR and pS757-ULK1 in the hippocampus on the ischemic side. Our findings suggest that puerarin alleviates autophagy by activating the APMK-mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway. Thus , puerarin might have therapeutic potential for treating cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.
