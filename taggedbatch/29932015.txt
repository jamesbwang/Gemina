 Chronic inflammation<symptom> is a major driving factor for the development of colitis-associated cancer ( CAC). It is extensively acknowledged that patients who have long-standing inflammation<symptom> bowel disease ( IBD) are at high risk for developing CAC. However , the metabolic alteration by which chronic intestinal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> promotes colorectal cancer is unclear. In the present study , we constructed dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS)- induced chronic colitis<disease> mouse model to uncover possible alterations in the metabolism indexes. Interestingly , after DSS diet administration , the expression of metabolism indexes and c-Myc increased. Moreover , in vitro , we treated cells with IL-6 to simulate inflammatory microenvironment and found that glucose uptake , lactate production and LDH activity increased dramatically , mirroring what was observed in vivo. Additionally , the associative inhibition of STAT3 and c-Myc could significantly block the expression of metabolic enzymes. With the inhibition of STAT3/c-Myc signaling , meanwhile , the upregulation of cell glucose uptake and lactate production by IL-6 pre-treated were both reduced simultaneously. Thus , our study indicates that inflammation<symptom> could induce metabolic disorder by promoting STAT3 signaling and c-Myc activity. Collectively , we find that metabolic disruptions triggered by inflammatory signaling are associated with tumorigenesis via the STAT3/c-Myc axis.
