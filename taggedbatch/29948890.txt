 This study aimed to validate the accuracy of major-event risk models created in the multicenter J-ACCESS prognostic study in a new cohort of patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD). Three multivariable J-ACCESS risk models were created to predict major cardiac events ( cardiac death , non-fatal acute coronary syndrome<disease><symptom> , and severe heart<symptom> failure<symptom> requiring hospitalization): Model 1 , four variables of age , summed stress score , left ventricular ejection fraction and diabetes; Model 2 with five variables including estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR , continuous); and Model 3 with categorical eGFR. The validation data used three-year ( 3y) cohort of patients with CKD ( n = 526 , major events 11.2 %). Survival analysis of low ( < 3 %/ 3y) , intermediate ( 3 % to 9 %/ 3y) , and high ( > 9 %/ 3y)- risk groups showed good stratification by all three models ( actual event rates: 3.1 % , 9.9 % , and 15.9 % in the three groups with eGFR ≥ 15 mL/min/1 .73 m The J-ACCESS risk models can stratify patients with CKD and eGFR ≥ 15 mL/min/1 .73 m
