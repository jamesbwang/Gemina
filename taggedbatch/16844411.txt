 The aim of this study was to investigate possible correlations between aerobic and anaerobic fitness ( in field tests) with performance during a 90 min friendly match , through the following variables: total distance covered , maximal running speed , number of high-intensity actions and number of sprints. Eighteen professional soccer players from a Brazilian elite team ( age 23 ± 3 years , body mass 77.5 ± 8.9 kg) participated in the study. The athletes performed a Yo-Yo Endurance Test ( aerobic fitness) and a Running Anaerobic Sprint Test ( six maximal 35 m efforts separated by 10 s of passive recovery , anaerobic fitness). Data were collected during friendly matches using a GPS with 5 Hz technology. To establish the correlation between the variables determined during the matches , the Pearson correlation coefficient was used ( significance level of p ≤ 0.05). A high correlation was found between distance covered in the Yo-Yo endurance test and total distance covered ( r = 0.72; p < 0.05) , number of high-intensity actions ( r = 0.78; p < 0.05) and number of sprints ( r = 0.88; p < 0.01) in the soccer matches. The RAST variables did not relate to the standards set during the matches ( p < 0.05). From the results of the present study , it may be concluded that there is no correlation between RAST and friendly match data variables. However , better results in the Yo-Yo endurance test correlate with total distance , number of high-intensity actions and sprints during matches.
