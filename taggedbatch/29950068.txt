 Gekko gecko ( Tokay Gecko) is a valuable traditional Chinese medicine. In this study , the loop-mediated isothermal amplification ( LAMP) technique was introduced for visual rapid identification of G. gecko from adulterants. A total of sixty-five 12S rRNA sequences of fourteen species of G. gecko and its adulterants were obtained. The results showed that G. gecko could be identified from its adulterants through BLAST analysis based on 12S rRNA regions. The 12S rRNA sequences of ten batches of G. gecko were conserved. There were only two haplotypes and three variation sites in the available regions for primers design. Six specific LAMP primers were successfully designed online based on 12S rRNA sequences. The visual rapid detection of G. gecko could be achieved with the optimized conditions ( 64 °C for 1 h and 80 °C for 5 min). And the required minimal template concentration was 5 μg · L ⁻¹ while conventional PCR with 0.5 mg · L ⁻¹. Consequently , the LAMP method established from this study was rapid , specific , highly sensitive , and simple. It could be applied to detect G. gecko from its adulterants efficiently.
