 Mitochondrial accumulation of intracellular amyloid beta ( Aβ) peptides is present in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) , as well as in related mouse models of AD. This accumulation is extremely toxic because Aβ disrupts the normal functions of many mitochondrial proteins , resulting in significant mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore , understanding the mitochondrial accumulation of Aβ is useful for future pharmaceutical design of drugs to address mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. However , the detailed molecular mechanism of this accumulation process remains elusive. Here , using yeast mitochondria , we present direct experimental evidence suggesting that Aβ is specifically recognized by translocase<disease> of outer mitochondrial membrane subunit 22 ( Tom22 in yeast , TOMM22 in human) , a noncanonical receptor within the mitochondrial protein import machinery , and that this recognition is critical for Aβ accumulation in mitochondria. Furthermore , we found that residues 25-42 in the Aβ peptide mediate the specific interaction with TOMM22. On the basis of our findings , we propose that cytosolic Aβ is recognized by TOMM22; transferred to another translocase<disease> subunit , TOMM40; and transported through the TOMM channel into the mitochondria. Our results not only confirm that yeast mitochondria can be used as a model to study mitochondrial dysfunction caused by Aβ peptides in AD , but also pave the way for future studies of the molecular mechanism of mitochondrial Aβ accumulation.
