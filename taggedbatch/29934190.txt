 In this study , effects of low intensity electrical current ( EC) and ultrasound ( US) treatments on the reduction of some important pesticides ( captan , thiamethoxam and metalaxyl) residues in tomato samples were investigated. Three different currents ( 200 , 800 and 1400mA) of EC were applied at various time intervals ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 and 10 min). Two kinds of US treatments including ultrasonic bath ( UB) at 40kHz and ultrasonic probe ( UP) at 24kHz were tested for the determination of US effectiveness. In addition , synergistic effects of US on EC treatments were evaluated. The most effective conditions for reduction of captan , thiamethoxam and metalaxyl residues were 1400mA +40 kHz , 800mA +24 kHz and 1400mA +24 kHz , respectively. The residues of captan , thiamethoxam and metalaxyl were reduced in the order of 94.24 % , 69.80 % and 95.06 % by using these combinations. EC and US strategies can be considered as effective treatments in industrial scale in order to remove the pesticide residues from vegetables.
