 Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly affecting more than 5 million people in the U.S. AD is characterized by the accumulation of β-amyloid ( Aβ) and Tau in the brain , and is manifested by severe impairments in memory and cognition. Therefore , removing tau pathology has become one of the main therapeutic goals for the treatment of AD. Tau ( tubulin-associated unit) is a major neuronal cytoskeletal protein found in the CNS encoded by the gene MAPT. Alternative splicing generates two major isoforms of tau containing either 3 or 4 repeat ( R) segments. These 3R or 4RTau species are differentially expressed in neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have been focused on reducing Tau accumulation with antibodies against total Tau , 4RTau or phosphorylated isoforms. Here , we developed a brain penetrating , single chain antibody that specifically recognizes a pathogenic 3RTau. This single chain antibody was modified by the addition of a fragment of the apoB protein to facilitate trafficking into the brain , once in the CNS these antibody fragments reduced the accumulation of 3RTau and related deficits in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy. NMR studies showed that the single chain antibody recognized an epitope at aa 40-62 of 3RTau. This single chain antibody reduced 3RTau transmission and facilitated the clearance of Tau via the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. Together , these results suggest that targeting 3RTau with highly specific , brain penetrating , single chain antibodies might be of potential value for the treatment of tauopathies such as Pick 's Disease.
