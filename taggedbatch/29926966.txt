 A cough<symptom> stress test ( CST) is recommended in the evaluation of the uncomplicated female patient with the complaint of stress urinary incontinence ( SUI) to identify the sign of SUI , and is often used as an outcome measure following SUI treatment. However , there has been no standardization of the performance or reporting of CST. A working group of the International Continence Society ( ICS) has developed an educational module , comprising a Powerpoint â„¢ presentation and evidence base manuscript , to instruct on the performance , interpretation , and reporting of the CST in a standardized manner: the ICS-Uniform Cough<symptom> Stress Test ( ICS-UCST). The working group performed a PUBMED literature search of articles ( observational/experimental and reviews) published prior to 2017 that mentioned a CST. The evidence base examined various variables in performing a CST as well as sensitivity/specificity and positive/negative predictive values of CST. The variables involved in performing/interpreting an ICS-UCST include: patient positioning , degree of bladder filling , number , and forcefulness of coughs<symptom> , and method of SUI detection. For the ICS-UCST it is recommended that the patient be in a supine/lithotomy position with 200-400 mL of fluid in the bladder. She coughs<symptom> forcefully 1-4 times and the examiner directly visualizes the urethral meatus for the presence of leakage. Leakage of fluid from the urethral meatus coincident with/simultaneous to the cough<symptom> ( s) is considered a positive test. This module provides instructions to educate a uniform CST ( the ICS-UCST) , with the aim of improving the clinical practice of cough<symptom> stress testing in female patients with urinary incontinence.
