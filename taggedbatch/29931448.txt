 Pre-diabetes is a strong risk factor for type 2diabetes ( T2D). The aim of this study was to explore factors associated with normal glucose maintenance and pre-diabetes prevention or delay. Data of 1016 first-degree relatives of T2D patients were retrieved from the Isfahan Diabetes Prevention Study ( IDPS). Association of various variables including nutrients , serum tests and physical activity with the risk of pre-diabetes was assessed using recurrent events approach. Cumulative incidence of diabetes was 8.17 , 9.44 , and 4.91 % for total sample and individuals with and without pre-diabetes experience in the follow-up. Risk of progression to pre-diabetes was higher in women and older people ( p < 0.01). Additionally , BMI and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> had significant association with the risk ( p < 0.01) and individuals with higher intake of fat were at higher risk ( HR = 2.26; 95 % CI 1.66-3.07 for high-intake and HR = 1.52; 95 % CI 1.27-1.83 for medium-intake compared to low-intake group). Carbohydrates and protein intake were positively associated with the risk of pre-diabetes with HR = 8.63 per 49 g extra carbohydrates per day and HR = 1.32 per 6 g extra protein per day ( p < 0.01). The association was also significant for triglyceride ( TG) with 7 % risk increase per 1 SD = 1.14 increase in TG level. Despite frequent studies on lifestyle modification for pre-diabetes prevention , less information is available about the role of nutritional components. We observed direct effects for intake of macronutrients including fat , carbohydrates , and protein in first-degree relatives. Further research is warranted to assess these associations in general populations. Level III: Evidence obtained from a single-center cohort study.
