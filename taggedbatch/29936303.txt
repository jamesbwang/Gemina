 Adaptive immunity is critical in vascular remodelling following arterial injury. We hypothesized that acute changes in T cells at a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA) site could serve as an index of their potential interaction with the injured vascular wall. T cell subsets were characterised in 45 patients with Rutherford 3-4 peripheral artery disease ( PAD) undergoing PTA. Direct angioplasty catheter blood sampling was performed before and immediately after the procedure. PTA was associated with an acute reduction of α/β-TcR CD8 + T cells. Further characterisation revealed significant reduction in pro-atherosclerotic CD28nullCD57 + T cells , effector ( CD45RA + CCR7-) and effector memory ( CD45RA-CCR7-) cells , in addition to cells bearing activation ( CD69 , CD38) and tissue homing/adhesion markers ( CD38 , CCR5). The acute reduction observed here is likely due to the adhesion of cells to the injured vascular wall , suggesting that immunosenescent , activated effector CD8 + cells have a role in the early vascular injury immune response following PTA in PAD patients.
