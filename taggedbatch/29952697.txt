 Clinical Scenario: ReBound ( ReGear Life Sciences , Inc , Pittsburgh , PA) is a portable shortwave diathermy unit ( SWD) used to heat tissues using the same principle as induction drum SWD. It is unclear if ReBound can vigorously ( 4 °C) heat intramuscular tissue as efficiently as other thermal agents. In adults ( P) , is ReBound diathermy ( I) compared to other thermal agents ( C) effective at increasing intramuscular tissue temperature by 4 °C ( O)? Summary of Key Findings: Three studies were included for review , all randomized crossover studies. All studies agreed ReBound does not achieve vigorous ( 4 °C) heating effects during a 30-minute treatment to the triceps surae muscle ( depth = 1 and 3-cm). Studies agreed the heat generated via ReBound dissipates slower than ( p < .001) or similarly to PSWD at 3 cm and faster than moist hot packs ( MHP , p < .001) at 1 cm. One study found intramuscular tissue temperatures increased more with ReBound ( 3.69 °C ± 1.50 °C) than MHP ( 2.82 °C ± .90 °C) at superficial depths ( 1-cm , d = .70). Two studies compared ReBound to MegaPulse II PSWD at a 3-cm depth. One found the MegaPulse II increased intramuscular tissue temperature by 4.32 °C ± 1.79 °C compared to the ReBound 's 2.31 °C ± .87 °C increase ( d = 1.43). The final study reported the MegaPulse II increased triceps surae muscle temperature by 3.47 °C ± .92 °C versus ReBound at 3.08 °C ± 1.19 °C ( d = .37). The combined results are an increase of 3.81 ± 1.38 °C for the MegaPulse II and 2.77 ± 1.12 °C for ReBound ( d = .83). Clinical Bottom Line: Results strongly indicate ReBound should not be used for vigorous ( 4 °C) heating effects in the triceps surae muscle at 1 and 3-cm. Clinicians can use ReBound when traveling or instead of MHP for moderate ( 2-3 °C) heating effects at deep and superficial levels ( 1 and 3-cm) for large treatment areas with subcutaneous fat thickness < 15 mm. Strength of Recommendation: Consistent level B findings indicate ReBound does not achieve vigorous heating effects ( 4 °C).
