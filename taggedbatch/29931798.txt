 MoodSwings 2.0 is an online self-guided intervention for bipolar disorder that includes educational modules , interactive tools , and discussion forums. The primary aim of the study was to determine if participation in MoodSwings 2.0 would result in decreased symptoms of depression<symptom> and mania compared to the control condition. Secondary aims were to identify improvements in core depression<symptom> symptoms , quality of life , medication adherence , functioning , and time to relapse. This was a three-arm randomized controlled trial that compared two intervention arms against a peer support control group ( forum). A total of 304 adults aged 21 to 65 years with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder were assigned to a forum-only control group ( Group 1; n = 102) , a forum plus modules treatment group ( Group 2; n = 102) , or a forum , modules , and tools treatment group ( Group 3; n = 100) , in addition to usual care. There was a significant intervention impact showing improvement on the primary outcome of depression<symptom> for Group 2 compared to Group 1 ( P = .05) with effect sizes ( Cohen 's d) ranging from 0.17 to 0.43. There was also a significant intervention impact showing improvement on the secondary outcome of core depression<symptom> for Group 2 ( P = .02) and Group 3 ( P = .05) , but worse physical functioning for Group 3 ( P = .01) , compared to Group 1. This study provides evidence of the efficacy of internet-based psychoeducation interventions for bipolar disorder in reducing depressive symptoms. Further investigation is needed to assess effectiveness in a public program.
