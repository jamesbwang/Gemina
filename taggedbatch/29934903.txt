 By the turn of the twenty-first century , the use of nutraceuticals became increasingly popular in both humans and animals due to their easy access , cost-effectiveness , and tolerability with a wide margin of safety. While some nutraceuticals are safe , others have a toxic potential. For a large number of nutraceuticals , no toxicity/safety data are available due to a lack of pharmacological/toxicological studies. The safety of some nutraceuticals can be compromised via contamination with toxic plants , metals , mycotoxins , pesticides , fertilizers , drugs of abuse , etc.. Knowledge of pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic studies appears to play a pivotal role in safety and toxicity assessment of nutraceuticals. Interaction studies are essential to determine efficacy , safety , and toxicity when nutraceuticals and therapeutic drugs are used concomitantly. This chapter describes various aspects of nutraceuticals , particularly their toxic potential , and the factors influencing their safety.
