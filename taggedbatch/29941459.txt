 Myelodysplastic syndrome<disease><symptom> ( MDS) is a clonal heterogeneous stem cell disorder driven by multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations resulting in ineffective hematopoiesis. MDS has a high frequency of immune suppressors , including myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs) , that collectively result in a poor immune response. MDSCs in MDS patients express CD155 that ligates the T-cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domain ( TIGIT) and delivers an inhibitory signal to natural killer ( NK) cells. To mediate a productive immune response against MDS , negative regulatory checkpoints , like TIGIT , expressed on MDS NK cells must be overcome. NK cells can be directed to lyse MDS cells by bispecific killer engagers ( BiKEs) that ligate CD16 on NK cells and CD33 on MDS cells. However , such CD16 Ã— CD33 ( 1633) BiKEs do not induce the proliferative response in MDS NK cells needed to sustain their function. Here , we show that the addition of an NK stimulatory cytokine , interleukin-15 ( IL-15) , into the BiKE platform leads to productive IL-15 signaling without TIGIT upregulation on NK cells from MDS patients. Lower TIGIT expression allowed NK cells to resist MDSC inhibition. When compared with 1633 BiKE , 161533 trispecific killer engager ( TriKE)- treated NK cells demonstrated superior killing kinetics associated with increased STAT5 phosphorylation. Furthermore , 161533 TriKE-treated MDS NK cells had higher proliferation and enhanced NK-cell function than 1633 BiKE-treated cells without the IL-15 linker. Collectively , our data demonstrate novel characteristics of the 161533 TriKE that support its application as an immunotherapeutic agent for MDS patients.
