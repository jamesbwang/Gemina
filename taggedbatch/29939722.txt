 As a group of new persistent organic pollutants , short-chain chlorinated paraffins ( SCCPs) and medium-chain CP ( MCCPs) have attracted extensive worldwide interest in recent years. However , the data regarding to the environmental behavior , especially in atmospheric transfer and air-seawater exchange , are still sparse. In this study , seasonal marine boundary layer air and seawater samples were collected from Chinese Bohai sea and a fugacity model was built to evaluate the air-seawater diffusion and deposition flux of CPs. Generally , the total CP levels in atmosphere and seawater samples in summer were higher than those in spring , and CPs existed mostly in the gaseous phase in air and the dissolved phase in seawater. For SCCPs , C
