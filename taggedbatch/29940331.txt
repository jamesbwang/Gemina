 Hydroxyurea , a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor , is a potent teratogen in mice , causing severe<symptom> limb and skeletal defects. The exposure of gestation day nine murine embryos to hydroxyurea elicits an early embryonic stress response that involves activation of the P53 transcription factor. The impact of this P53 activation on the embryotoxicity of hydroxyurea- is not known. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that P53 acts to suppress hydroxyurea embryotoxicity. Trp53
