 An electrochemical methodology for the characterization of mycotoxin-producing fungal species from the genera Aspergillus<pathogen> and Fusarium<pathogen> using solid-state voltammetry is described. Upon attachment of fungal colony microsamples to glassy carbon electrodes in contact with aqueous acetate buffer , characteristic voltammetric signals mainly associated to the oxidation of polyphenolic metabolites are recorded. The possibility of fungi-localized electrochemical processes was assessed by means of electron microscopy and field emission scanning electrochemical microscopy coupled to the application of oxidative potential inputs. Using pattern recognition methods , the determined voltammetric profiles were able to discriminate between mycotoxin-producing fungi<pathogen> from different sections and to identify selected toxigenic species of the Aspergillus<pathogen> and Fusarium<pathogen> genera isolated from grapes and cereals.
