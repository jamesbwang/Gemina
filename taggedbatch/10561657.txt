 Women are particularly vulnerable to anxiety<symptom> and depressive disorders. This greater vulnerability has been partly attributed to post-pubertal sex hormone fluctuations , estradiol and progesterone , as well as gender-specific tendencies to engage in maladaptive forms of emotion regulation , particularly rumination. To date , no research has investigated whether sex hormones are associated with emotion regulation in women. In the present study , 61 women participated in a sad mood induction task , involving the viewing of an emotive film. Negative affect was assessed immediately and following recovery , along with self-reported use of rumination , reappraisal , and suppression. Serum levels of estradiol and progesterone were assessed through a blood sample taken at the end of the experiment. Regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between serum hormones and self-reported emotional regulation strategy use , and between serum hormones and the impact of these strategies on negative affect. Estradiol levels positively predicted rumination , but not suppression or reappraisal use. Moreover , estradiol and progesterone interacted with emotion regulation strategies to predict negative affect following the sad mood induction. Reappraisal was associated with greater negative affect only in women with high estradiol , and in women with high progesterone. Conversely , rumination was associated with greater negative affect only in women with low estradiol. Together , these results suggest that sex hormone concentration may be an endogenous contextual factor that is associated with the selection and consequences of emotion regulation strategies in women.
