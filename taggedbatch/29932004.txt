 Direct physicochemical interactions between the major components of electronic cigarette liquids ( e-liquids): glycerol ( VG) and propylene glycol ( PG) , and lung surfactant ( LS) were studied by determining the dynamic surface tension under a simulated breathing cycle using drop shape method. The studies were performed for a wide range of concentrations based on estimated doses of e-liquid aerosols ( up to 2500 × the expected nominal concentrations) and for various VG/PG ratios. The results are discussed as relationships among mean surface tension , surface tension amplitude , and surface rheological properties ( dilatational elasticity and viscosity) versus concentration and composition of e-liquid. The results showed that high local concentrations ( > 200 × higher than the estimated average dose after a single puffing session) may induce measurable changes in biophysical activity of LS; however , only ultra-high e-liquid concentrations inactivated the surfactant. Physiochemical characterization of e-liquids provide additional insights for the safety assessment of electronic nicotine delivery systems ( ENDS).
