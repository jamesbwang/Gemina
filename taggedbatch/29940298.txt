 Mucopolysaccharidosis type I ( MPS I) is caused by the lysosomal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs<symptom>) due to the deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase ( IDUA). Currently available treatments may improve several clinical manifestations , but they have limited effects on joint disease , resulting in persistent orthopedic complications and impaired mobility. Thus , this study aimed to perform an intra-articular administration of cationic nanoemulsions complexed with the plasmid encoding for the IDUA protein ( pIDUA) targeting MPS I gene therapy for the synovial joints. Formulations composed of DOPE , DOTAP , MCT ( NE) , and DSPE-PEG ( NE-PEG) were prepared by high-pressure homogenization , and the pIDUA plasmid was associated by adsorption onto the surface of nanoemulsions ( pIDUA/NE or pIDUA/NE-PEG). The physicochemical characterization showed that the presence of DSPE-PEG in pIDUA/NE-PEG formulations led to small and highly stable droplets even when incubated with simulated synovial fluid ( SSF) , when compared to the non-pegylated complexes ( pIDUA/NE). Uptake by fibroblast-like synoviocytes ( FLS) was demonstrated , and high cell viability ( 70 %) in addition with increased IDUA activity ( 2.5 % of normal) were observed after incubation with pIDUA/NE-PEG. The intra-articular injection of pIDUA/NE-PEG complexes in MPS I mice showed that the complexes were localized in the joints , were able to transfect synovial cells , and thus promoted an increase in IDUA activity and expression in the synovial fluid , with no significant activity in other tissues ( kidney , liver , lung , and spleen). The overall results demonstrated a contained , safe , tolerable , and effective in situ approach of nonviral intra-articular gene therapy targeting the reduction or prevention of the debilitating orthopedic complications of MPS I disorder.
