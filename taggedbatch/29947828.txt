 The study investigated the association between socio-economic status ( SES) and self-reported chronic<disease> disease<disease> ( CD) among the Palestinian population in the Occupied Palestinian Territory , and whether this association was similar in the refugee camps. We used data from representative samples in 2006 and 2010 collected by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. SES was defined by education , wealth and employment status. Associations between SES and CD were analysed and stratified by living in or outside refugee camps. CD prevalence increased among men and decreased among women in all SES categories and the Odds Ratio for CD was higher inside than outside the refugee camps , except for women in 2006. In both 2006 and 2010 the odds ratio of CD was higher among the lowest SES groups. The pattern of the negative association between SES and CD was similar in and outside the refugee camps. We found that the highest burden of CD is among those with low SES. In spite of a higher CD Odds Ratio in the refugee camps , the pattern of association between SES and CD did not differ in the refugee camps.
