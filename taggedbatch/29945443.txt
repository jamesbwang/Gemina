 We developed a simple method to adjust the structural transformation of DNA-gold nanoparticles assemblies from linear arrays to nanorings by increasing salt concentrations. A DNA nanoladder constructing from RCA origami acted as templates to assemble periodic AuNPs arrays by a terminal thiol located on staple oligonucleotides. The linear AuNPs arrays could be transformed into nanorings only by changing the concentration of NaCl aqueous solution during the assembly process. It was proven that the electrostatic repulsion , being asymmetrically diminished by the high concentration of NaCl , caused the formation of nanoring architectures.
