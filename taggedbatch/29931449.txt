 GPR54 is highly expressed in the central nervous system and plays a crucial role in pubertal development. However , GRP54 is also expressed in the immune system , implying possible immunoregulatory functions. Here we investigated the role of GPR54 in T cell and immune tolerance. GPR54 deficiency led to an enlarged thymus , an increased number of thymocytes , and altered thymic micro-architecture starting around puberty , indicating GPR54 function in T-cell development through its regulatory effect on the gonadal system. However , flow cytometry revealed a significant reduction in the peripheral regulatory T cell population and a moderate decrease in CD4 single-positive thymocytes in prepubertal Gpr54
