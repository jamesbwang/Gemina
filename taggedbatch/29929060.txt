 Cannulating fenestrated pedicle screws are effective for fixating osteoporotic vertebrae. However , a major limitation is the excessive pressure required to inject a sufficient amount of cement into the vertebral body through the narrow hole of a pedicle screw. We have recently proposed a new cannulating fenestrated pedicle screw with a large hole diameter and a matched inner pin for screw-strength maintenance. Our purpose was to determine whether the new screw can significantly reduce bone-cement perfusion pressure during cement augmentation , METHODS: Two different methods were used to examine perfusion pressure. Hagen-Poisseuille 's flow model in a tube was used to calculate pressure drop in the bone-cement channel. Experimentally , both Newtonian silicone oil and bone-cement ( polymethyl methacrylate) were tested using a cement pusher through the cannulating screw at a constant rate of 2 ml/min. The internal hollow portion of the screw was the bottleneck of the perfusion , and the new design significantly reduced the perfusion pressure. Specifically , perfusion pressure dropped by 59 % ( P < 0.05) when diameter size was doubled. The new design effectively improved the application of bone-cement augmentation with the ease of bone-cement perfusion , thereby enhancing operational safety.
