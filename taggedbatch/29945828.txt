 Well-designed implant registries have been shown to be a worthwhile investment , from both a health and economic perspective. However , many registries do not attain desirable capture rates or lack sufficient funding , potentially leading to premature termination. This study aims to provide information about rarely discussed , yet pivotal topics regarding the long-term survival of implant registries , focusing on costs , funding models , and the role of stakeholders. Worldwide , relatively recently developed breast device ( BD) registries were compared to long-standing , orthopaedic ( OD) and cardiovascular device ( CD) registries. A standardised questionnaire was sent to the registries ' designated representatives with key positions , discussing start-up costs , costs of maintenance , value of investment , governance , stakeholders , funding , and sustainability. Thirteen registries were included , originating from nine countries ( seven BD registries , five OD registries , one CD registry). In general , start-up costs were comparable , and younger registries were more expensive to maintain. Numerous stakeholders showed interest in registry outcomes. However , only 50 % of the registries reported a sustainable funding structure. This study provides a global perspective on implantable device registries. All registries provided important information , serving three unique purposes by evaluating the quality of healthcare provided , the quality of all registered devices , and processing recall information. Yet , only half of the registries were certain of sustainable funding , and thus their future existence. It is of utmost importance to bring this to the attention of all parties involved.
