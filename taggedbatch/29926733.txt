 To characterize suicide in early China , as a means of extending knowledge of this behaviour. We examined Romance of the Three Kingdoms , and collated and considered relevant details. In early China , loss of authority/status , loved ones and fortune were triggers for suicide. The expression of the intention to suicide , either by word or action , was observed and elicited a placating response. Less frequent , but nevertheless clearly recorded , were accounts of suicide completed to satisfy the wishes of others. The suicide and related behaviour of early China shares many features with late Western societies , but one form ( to satisfy the wishes of others) is currently undetected.
