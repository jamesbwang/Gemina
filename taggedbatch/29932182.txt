 A clickable fullerene hexa-adduct scaffold has been functionalized with twelve triarylamine subunits. The light-triggered self-assembly of this molecular unit leads to 3D honeycomb-like structures with inner pores of around 10 nm diameter. Multiple grafting of triarylamine subunits onto a hard-core C
