 Cisplatin chemotherapy and surgery are effective treatments for children with standard-risk hepatoblastoma but may cause considerable and irreversible hearing loss. This trial compared cisplatin with cisplatin plus delayed administration of sodium thiosulfate , aiming to reduce the incidence and severity of cisplatin-related ototoxic effects without jeopardizing overall and event-free survival. We randomly assigned children older than 1 month and younger than 18 years of age who had standard-risk hepatoblastoma ( â‰¤ 3 involved liver sectors , no metastatic disease , and an alpha-fetoprotein level of > 100 ng per milliliter) to receive cisplatin alone ( at a dose of 80 mg per square meter of body-surface area , administered over a period of 6 hours) or cisplatin plus sodium thiosulfate ( at a dose of 20 g per square meter , administered intravenously over a 15-minute period , 6 hours after the discontinuation of cisplatin) for four preoperative and two postoperative courses. The primary end point was the absolute hearing threshold , as measured by pure-tone audiometry , at a minimum age of 3.5 years. Hearing loss was assessed according to the Brock grade ( on a scale from 0 to 4 , with higher grades indicating greater hearing loss). The main secondary end points were overall survival and event-free survival at 3 years. A total of 109 children were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin plus sodium thiosulfate ( 57 children) or cisplatin alone ( 52) and could be evaluated. Sodium thiosulfate was associated with few high-grade toxic effects. The absolute hearing threshold was assessed in 101 children. Hearing loss of grade 1 or higher occurred in 18 of 55 children ( 33 %) in the cisplatin-sodium thiosulfate group , as compared with 29 of 46 ( 63 %) in the cisplatin-alone group , indicating a 48 % lower incidence of hearing loss in the cisplatin-sodium thiosulfate group ( relative risk , 0.52; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.33 to 0.81; P = 0.002). At a median of 52 months of follow-up , the 3-year rates of event-free survival were 82 % ( 95 % CI , 69 to 90) in the cisplatin-sodium thiosulfate group and 79 % ( 95 % CI , 65 to 88) in the cisplatin-alone group , and the 3-year rates of overall survival were 98 % ( 95 % CI , 88 to 100) and 92 % ( 95 % CI , 81 to 97) , respectively. The addition of sodium thiosulfate , administered 6 hours after cisplatin chemotherapy , resulted in a lower incidence of cisplatin-induced hearing loss among children with standard-risk hepatoblastoma , without jeopardizing overall or event-free survival.
