 Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> is a protozoan parasite of veterinary and human public health importance for which birds act as an intermediate host. No information is available about the epidemiology of T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> in wild birds of Pakistan. The present study was designed to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> antibodies in wild birds of District Kasur , Punjab Province , Pakistan. A total of 200 wild birds of 28 species were captured from four tehsils ( administrative subdistricts of districts) of the district Kasur and their serum samples screened for the presence of T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> antibodies using a latex agglutination test ( LAT; cut-off value: 1:64). Twenty-five ( 13 %) individual birds and 13 ( 46 %) of the bird species were seropositive for T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> antibodies. There were statistical differences in T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> prevalence between adults and young ( 15 % and 7 % , respectively , P = 0.001) and healthy and sick ( 11 % and 50 % , respectively , P = 0.000) while there were not differences between genders , sites , urbanicity , and tehsils. The present study provides evidence of T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> antibodies in wild birds of Pakistan.
