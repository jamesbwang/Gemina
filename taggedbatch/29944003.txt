 The main purpose was to evaluate , using the Think-Aloud method , a version of the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised for stroke survivors. Six stroke survivors ( mean age = 58.8 years , range = 31-78 years , standard deviation = 18.9 years) took part in Think-Aloud interviews , analysed according to established guidelines. Overall , 179 problems emerged. The most noteworthy was missing or insufficient Think-Aloud data generated , where participants did not think out loud. Others included complex and negative item wording , and items on the treatment control sub-scale. Questionnaire length , simpler wording and verbal probing are important considerations in further development of an Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised for stroke survivors.
