 Oxidative stress is a pathogenic feature in vitreoretinal disease. However , the ability of the inner retina to manage metabolic waste and oxidative stress is unknown. Proteomic analysis of antioxidants in the human vitreous , the extracellular matrix opposing the inner retina , identified superoxide dismutase-3 ( SOD3) that localized to a unique matrix structure in the vitreous base and cortex. To determine the role of SOD3 , Sod3
