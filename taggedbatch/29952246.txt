 Angiopoietin-like protein 4 ( Angptl4)/ fasting-induced adipose factor ( Fiaf) expression levels are increased by exercise in skeletal muscle. We have previously shown that Angptl4 regulates food intake and energy expenditure via modulation of hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK) activity. AMPK is an important signaling molecule that integrates skeletal muscle metabolism during exercise. Therefore , we investigated the involvement of Angptl4 in exercise-induced AMPK activation in skeletal muscle. Angptl4 protein and mRNA expression levels were significantly increased in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles of mice following a 50-min running bout. Treatment of C2C12 myotubes with Angptl4 increased phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase ( ACC) , which are markers of AMPK activation , and the mitochondrial maximum respiratory capacity. Treadmill exercise increased AMPK and ACC phosphorylation in the gastrocnemius of normal mice; this phosphorylation increase was attenuated in mice lacking Angptl4. Endurance to swimming and hanging was also reduced in Angptl4 knockout mice. Taken together , our current data demonstrate that exercise-induced upregulation of skeletal muscle Angptl4 is critical for AMPK activation and exercise tolerance. These findings unveil a new role for skeletal muscle Angptl4 in exercise physiology.
