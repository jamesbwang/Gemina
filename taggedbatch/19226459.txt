 As species diverge , so does their transposable element ( TE) content. Within a genome , TE families may eventually become dormant due to host-silencing mechanisms , natural selection and the accumulation of inactive copies. The transmission of active copies from a TE families , both vertically and horizontally between species , can allow TEs to escape inactivation if it occurs often enough , as it may allow TEs to temporarily escape silencing in a new host. Thus , the contribution of horizontal exchange to TE persistence has been of increasing interest. Here , we annotated TEs in five species with sequenced genomes from the The TE content is highly dynamic in the
