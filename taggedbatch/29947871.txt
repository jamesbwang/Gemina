 The clinical spectrum of hypophosphatasia ( HPP) is broad and variable within families. Along severe infantile forms , adult forms with mild manifestations may be incidentally discovered by the presence of low alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) activity in serum. However , it is still unclear whether individuals with persistently low levels of ALP , in the absence of overt manifestations of HPP , have subclinical abnormalities of bone remodeling or bone mass. The aim of this study was to obtain a better understanding of the skeletal phenotype of adults with low ALP by analyzing bone mineral density ( BMD) , bone microarchitecture ( trabecular bone score , TBS) , and bone turnover markers ( P1NP and ß-crosslaps). We studied 42 individuals with persistently low serum ALP. They showed lower levels of P1NP ( 31.4 ± 13.7 versus 48.9 ± 24.4 ng/ml; p = 0.0002) and ß-crosslaps ( 0.21 ± 0.17 versus 0.34 ± 0.22 ng/ml , p = 0.0015) than individuals in the control group. There were no significant differences in BMD , bone mineral content , or TBS. These data suggest that individuals with hypophosphatasemia have an overall reduction of bone turnover , even in the absence of overt manifestations of HPP or low BMD. We evaluated bone mineral density ( BMD) , bone microarchitecture , and bone turnover markers in patients with low serum levels of alkaline phosphatase. Our results show that these patients have low bone remodeling even in the absence of BMD abnormalities , thus supporting the recommendation of avoiding antiresorptives such as bisphosphonates in these subjects.
