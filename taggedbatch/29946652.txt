 To investigate the clinical effects of combined muscle functions intensifier and straight wire appliance in the treatment of maxillary protrusion. Forty patients with maxillary protrusion were randomly divided into 2 groups ( group A and group B). Straight wire appliance and muscle function intensifier were used in group A , while patients in group B received straight wire appliance only. X-ray projection was conducted to measure relative maxillary index ( labial inclination of upper or lower incisor , SNB angle , ANB angle , FMA , maxillary plane angle , NA-PA , U1-FH , U1-PP , forward moving distance of U6) before and 6 months after treatment. The efficacy was analyzed and evaluated using SPSS 20.0 software package. After correction , labial inclination of upper or lower incisor , SNB angle , ANB angle , FMA , maxillary plane angle , NA-PA , U1-FH , U1-PP changed significantly in both groups ( P < 0.05) , but patients in group A achieved more incisor adduction and less forward moving distance of U6 , with significant difference between the two groups ( P < 0.05). Most patients with maxillary protrusion have a bad habit of mouth<symptom> breathing. Muscle function intensifier is used only at night and can relieve the patient 's mouth<symptom> breathing , speed up the movement of teeth , and reduce the loss of anchorage and ultimately , improve the correction efficiency and clinical effect of patients with maxillary protrusion.
