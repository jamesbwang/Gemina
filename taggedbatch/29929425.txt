 Cardiac laminopathies , associated with mutations in the LMNA gene , encompass a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations , involving electrical and mechanical alterations of cardiomyocytes. Thus , dilated cardiomyopathy , bradyarrhythmias and atrial<symptom> or ventricular tachyarrhythmias may occur in a number of combined phenotypes. Nowadays , some attempt has been made to identify clinical predictors for the most life-threatening complications of LMNA-associated heart disease , i.e. sudden cardiac death and end-stage heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. The goal of this manuscript is to combine the most recent evidences in an updated review to show the state-of-the-art of such a complex<disease> disease<disease> group. This is supposed to be the starting point to collect more data and design new ad hoc studies to identify clinically useful predictors to stratify risk in mutation carriers , including probands and their asymptomatic relatives.
