 Described herein is the synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of non-carboxylic inhibitors of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B designed using bioisosteric replacement strategy. Six N- ( 3- ( 1H-tetrazol-5-yl) phenyl) acetamide derivatives designed employing the aforementioned strategy were synthesized and screened for PTP1B inhibitory activity. Among the synthesized compounds , compound NM-03 exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity with IC
