 Night-eating syndrome<disease><symptom> ( NES) involves uncontrolled and most often repeated binge eating during the night. It is related with mood disorders as well as sleep disorders and it may cause obesity. Risks related to NES are obesity , binge eating disorder , bulimia nervosa , affective disorders , and sleep disorders. The objective of this study is to analyze eating habits in terms of the risk assessment of NES occurrence in the population of women in the Masovian Voivodeship ( in Poland). Six hundred and eleven women living in the Masovian Voivodeship participated in the study. The average age of the respondents was 22.7 years ( median = 23.0; interquartile range = 3.0). The Night Eating Questionnaire ( NEQ) was used to assess the risk of NES. In the studied group of women , 1.3 % of cases ( N = 12) reached a NEQ total score of ≥ 25 , which indicates a probability of 40.7 % for NES , while 0.7 % ( N = 4) reached a score of ≥ 30 , which indicates a probability of 72.2 % for occurrence of this syndrome<disease><symptom>. The highest average total score was observed in the group of obese people. The level of education of the participants did not significantly affect the NEQ score. A weak correlation was observed between the place of residence variable and the mood/sleep subscale ( NES may be one of the causes of overweight and obesity; therefore , the need for further studies on this health issue is justified. It is worth pointing out that knowing the conditions responsible for the occurrence of NES , it is possible to suggest a prevention procedure for this condition.
