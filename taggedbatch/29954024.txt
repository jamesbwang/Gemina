 Without well recognizing the vascular territories of the perforator , surgery might damage the pedicle and diminish flap survival. This study described a transillumination method for intraoperative mapping of the subfascial plexus of the perforator in the head and neck reconstruction with an anterolateral thigh ( ALT) flap and also compared the perioperative outcomes and complications of the method with those of the conventional two-pedicle ALT flap. Between January 2011 and December 2017 , 26 patients who underwent head and neck reconstruction with ALT flaps were evaluated as follows: 13 underwent the transillumination method ( case group) , and 13 ( age- and sex-matched) underwent standard two-pedicle flap procedures ( control group). Demographic factors , diagnosis , flap size , recipient site , perioperative data , and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups. There was no significant difference in age , sex , diagnosis , recipient sites , and flap size between the case and control groups. Regarding the perioperative outcomes , the harvesting time was significantly shorter in the case group than in the control group ( 60 vs. 100 minutes ,
