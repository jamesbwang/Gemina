 The development of rapid point-of-care tests for HIV<pathogen> infection has greatly reduced the problem of failure to return for test results. Test manufacturers are now developing test kits that can test for two or even three diseases at the same time , multiple-disease test kits. This study reports on the sensitivity and specificity of HIV<pathogen> tests when included on multi-disease test kits. 1029 participants were recruited from 2011 to 2014. HIV<pathogen> test kit sensitivities ranged from 91.1 to 100 % , and the HIV<pathogen> test kit specificities from 99.5 to 100 %. The two HIV<pathogen> kits which used oral fluid instead of blood performed well.
