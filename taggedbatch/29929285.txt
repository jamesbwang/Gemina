 The extent of urban ecological homogenization depends on how humans build , inhabit , and manage cities. Morphological and socio-economic facets of neighborhoods can drive the homogenization of urban forest<disease> cover , thus affecting ecological and hydrological processes , and ecosystem services. Recent evidence , however , suggests that the same biophysical drivers differentiating composition and structure of natural forests can further counteract the homogenization of urban forests. We hypothesize that climate can differentiate forest<disease> structure across residential macrosystems at regional-to-continental spatial scales. To test this hypothesis , forest<disease> structure ( tree and shrub cover and volume) was measured using LiDAR data and multispectral imagery across a residential macrosystem composed 1.4 million residential parcels contained in 9 cities and 1503 neighborhoods. Cities were selected along an evapotranspiration ( ET) gradient in the conterminous United States , ranging from the colder continental climate of Fargo , North Dakota ( ET = 464.43 mm) to the hotter subtropical climate of Tallahassee , Florida ( ET = 1000.47 mm). The relative effects of climate , urban morphology , and socio-economic variables on residential forest<disease> structure were assessed by using generalized linear models. Climate differentiated forest<disease> structure of the residential macrosystem as hypothesized. Average forest<disease> cover doubled along the ET gradient ( 0.39-0.78 m
