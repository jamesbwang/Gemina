 Research that focuses on the communication between deaf children and their hearing families is scarce despite the majority of deaf children being born into hearing families where a common communication mode needs to be forged. The aim of the study was to explore , describe and compare the nature of communication across typical daily contexts of a deaf child who uses South African Sign Language ( SASL) and who is born into a hearing family with no prior experience of SASL. A case study design which included quantitative and qualitative components was used to observe a nine year old grade one child with profound hearing loss. Spontaneous communication was observed with 13 communication partners in the home context and these included the mother , a sibling and peers. Two educators and 11 peers were observed in the educational context. Surveillance cameras were used to obtain 27 hours of video-recording in the home and 19 hours at the school. Interviews were conducted with the mother , siblings , educators , and the deaf child. It was observed that communication using SASL , albeit minimal , home signs , natural gestures and oral communication were used extensively. Due to a mismatch in the communication mode in the home context communication interactions were fewer and predominantly oral , impoverished and with frequent breakdowns whereas the communication interactions in the school were characterized by SASL , was meaningful and had fewer communication breakdowns. Communication for deaf children within the home is problematic as communication partners are not fluent in SASL.
