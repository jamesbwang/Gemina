 Sexual minorities ( SMs) experience elevated rates of substance use behaviors and disorders relative to heterosexuals; minority stress is theorized to contribute to these disparities. As SMs are not a homogenous group , analyses that aggregate SMs across sexual identity , age , or gender obscure important variation among this population. To date , age- and gender-specific disparities have not been rigorously examined using a large national sample. Using data on 67,354 adults ( ages 18-49) from the 2015 and 2016 National Survey of Drug Use and Health we examined age- and gender-specific disparities in smoking , heavy episodic drinking , marijuana use , illicit drug use , and alcohol/substance use disorder. Age groups were ages 18-25 , 26-34 , and 35-49. Using logistic regression , we estimated age- and gender-specific odds ratios for gay/lesbian and bisexual individuals , relative to heterosexuals; analyses adjusted for demographic characteristics. Bisexual women had significantly elevated odds of all outcomes at all ages , relative to heterosexual women. Gay/lesbian individuals had significantly elevated odds for nearly all outcomes compared to same-gender heterosexuals at ages 18-25 , but not consistently at older ages. For bisexual men , significant disparities compared to heterosexual men were only observed at ages 35-49 for marijuana use and alcohol/substance use disorder. We found notable within-group differences regarding SM disparities. While disparities were most pronounced in young adulthood for gay/lesbian individuals and mid-adulthood for bisexual men , bisexual women uniquely experienced disparities across all ages. Minority stress experiences may vary with respect to gender , age/cohort , and sexual identity , resulting in differential risk for substance use.
