 Commercial dietary supplements of calcium pyruvate claim to be beneficial for losing weight , increasing muscle endurance , and regulating metabolism. Most industrial preparations have some impurities , including parapyruvate. Parapyruvate is an inhibitor of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex ( KGDHC). However , the effect and mechanism of parapyruvate on cell senescence and the content of parapyruvate in the dietary supplements of calcium pyruvate are unknown. In this study , we prepared pure parapyruvate with a purity of 99.8 ± 0.1 % and investigated its ability to inhibit KGDHC activity and affect fibroblast senescence. Parapyruvate dose-dependently decreased KGDHC activity , with an IC
