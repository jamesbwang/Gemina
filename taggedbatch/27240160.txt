 Herein , a simple one-pot way is designed to prepare a type of multifunctional metal-organic framework ( MOF)- based hybrid nanogels by in situ hybridization of dopamine monomer in the skeleton of MnCo. The resultant hybrid nanoparticles ( named as MCP) show enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency in comparison with pure polydopamine or MnCo nanoparticles ( NPs) synthesized under a similar method and , therefore , show great potential for photothermal therapy ( PTT) in vivo. The MCP NPs are expected to possess
