 The use of tranexamic acid ( TXA) for reducing blood<symptom> loss<symptom> in intertrochanteric fracture ( IF) surgery remains controversial. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TXA in reducing transfusion requirements and blood<symptom> loss<symptom> for IF surgery. Databases , including PubMED , Cochrane , and Embase , were searched for RCTs that were published before February 2018 and that addressed the efficacy and safety of TXA in patients who underwent IF surgery. A total of 746 patients from 7 RCTs were subjected to meta-analysis. The results showed that TXA group had reduced surgical blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( weighted mean difference ( WMD) = -37.24 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): -48.70 to -25.77 , P < .00001) , reduced total blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( WMD = -199.08 , 95 % CI: -305.16 to -93.01 , P = .0002) , higher postoperative hemoglobin ( WMD = 0.46 , 95 % CI: 0.12 to 0.79 , P = .007) , and hematocrit levels ( WMD = 1.55 , 95 % CI: 0.64 to 2.47 , P = .008) compared to control group , while no significant differences were found in transfusion rates ( relative risk ( RR) = 0.75 , 95 % CI: 0.50 to 1.11 , P = .15) , postoperative drainage ( WMD = -38.82 , 95 % CI: -86.87 to 9.22 , P = .11) , and thromboembolic events ( RR = 0.94 , 95 % CI: 0.41 to 2.19 , P = .89). In patients undergoing IF surgery , the administration of TXA significantly reduced surgical blood<symptom> loss<symptom> and total blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , while it had no significant effect on transfusion rate , postoperative drainage , and the risk of thromboembolic events. Nevertheless , due to the variations in the included studies , additional RCTs are required to further validate these conclusions.
