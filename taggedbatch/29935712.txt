 Veterinary assessment of the condition and needs of livestock and their owners in an emergency is an essential element of the disaster response. The emergency response for livestock has 4 critical components: assessing the need for and attending to the immediate medical needs of injured or affected livestock , determining the resources available to meet the needs , including feed and facilities , identifying any ongoing threats or potential hazards to livestock health and welfare , and appropriate documentation of damages and actions by responders. Information gathered from cattle assessments by veterinarians is used to prioritize resources and plan for anticipated needs.
