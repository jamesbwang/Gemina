 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG) has been useful in the evaluation of myocardial inflammatory processes. However , it is challenging to identify them due to physiological 18F-FDG uptake. There are no publications demonstrating the application of FDG in post-transplant rejection in humans yet. The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of suppression of myocardial FDG uptake in post-transplant patients , comparing three different protocols of preparation. Ten patients after heart transplantation were imaged by FDG associated with three endomyocardial biopsies ( EMB) , scheduled in the first year after the procedure. Before each imaging , patients were randomized to one of three preparations: ( 1) hyperlipidic-hypoglycemic diet; ( 2) fasting longer than 12 hours; and ( 3) fasting associated with intravenous heparin. All patients would undergo the three methods. FDG images were analyzed using visual analysis scores and relative radiotracer cardiac uptake ( RRCU). The suppression rate of radiotracer activity ranged from 55 % to 62 %. Visual analysis showed that preparation 3 presented less efficacy in the suppression compared to the others. However , RRCU did not show difference between the preparations. Suppression of physiological myocardial FDG uptake after cardiac transplantation is feasible. The usefulness of heparin in the suppression is unclear.
