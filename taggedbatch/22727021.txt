 Bipolar disorder ( BD) , a type of psychiatric mood disorder , is manifested by chronic and recurrent mood fluctuations. This study aims to determine whether hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) or hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection is a risk factor for BD. A total of 48,215 patients with newly diagnosed viral hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> from 2000 to 2010 were identified and frequency-matched with 192,860 people without hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom>. Both groups were followed until diagnosis with BD , withdrawal from the national health insurance program , or the end of 2011. Patients with viral hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> were grouped into 3 cohorts: HBV infection , HCV<pathogen> infection , and HBV/HCV coinfection. The association between viral hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> and BD were examined using Cox proportional hazards regression models. The incidence of BD was higher in HBV/HCV coinfection than in the control group , with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.16 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.06-4.41) when adjusted for sex , age , and comorbidity. After further adjustment , we noted that an age more than 65 years and female may be associated with an increased risk of BD in patients with chronic hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> and C. Viral hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> may be associated with increased risk of subsequent BD.
