 Tools to aid in the prognosis assessment of colon cancer patients in terms of risk of mortality are needed. Goals of this study are to develop and validate clinical prediction rules for 1- and 2-year mortality in these patients. This is a prospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with colon cancer who underwent surgery at 22 hospitals. The main outcomes were mortality at 1 and 2 years after surgery. Background , clinical parameters , and diagnostic tests findings were evaluated as possible predictors. Multivariable multilevel logistic regression and survival models were used in the analyses to create the clinical prediction rules. Models developed in the derivation sample were validated in another sample of the study. American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System ( ASA) , Charlson comorbidity index ( > = 4) , age ( > 75 years) , residual tumor ( R2) , TNM stage IV and log of lymph nodes ratio ( > = -0.53) were predictors of 1-year mortality ( C-index ( 95 % CI): 0.865 ( 0.792-0.938)). Adjuvant chemotherapy was an additional predictor. Again ASA , Charlson Index ( > = 4) , age ( > 75 years) , log of lymph nodes ratio ( > = -0.53) , TNM , and residual tumor were predictors of 2-year mortality ( C-index: 0.821 ( 0.766-0.876). Chemotherapy was also an additional predictor. These clinical prediction rules show very good predictive abilities of one and two years survival and provide clinicians and patients with an easy and quick-to-use decision tool for use in the clinical decision process while the patient is still in the index admission.
