 With a view to introducing the concept of pharmacological space and its potential applications in investigating and predicting the toxic mechanisms of xenobiotics , this opening chapter describes the logical relations between conformational behavior , physicochemical properties and binding spaces , which are seen as the three key elements composing the pharmacological space. While the concept of conformational space is routinely used to encode molecular flexibility , the concepts of property spaces and , particularly , of binding spaces are more innovative. Indeed , their descriptors can find fruitful applications ( a) in describing the dynamic adaptability a given ligand experiences when inserted into a specific environment , and ( b) in parameterizing the flexibility a ligand retains when bound to a biological target. Overall , these descriptors can conveniently account for the often disregarded entropic factors and as such they prove successful when inserted in ligand- or structure-based predictive models. Notably , and although binding space parameters can clearly be derived from MD simulations , the chapter will illustrate how docking calculations , despite their static nature , are able to evaluate ligand 's flexibility by analyzing several poses for each ligand. Such an approach , which represents the founding core of the binding space concept , can find various applications in which the related descriptors show an impressive enhancing effect on the statistical performances of the resulting predictive models.
