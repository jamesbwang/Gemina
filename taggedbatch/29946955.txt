 Perturbation-based gait assessment has been used to quantify gait stability in older adults. However , knowledge on which perturbation type is most suitable to identify poor gait stability is lacking. We evaluated the effects of ipsi- and contra-lateral sway , belt acceleration and deceleration , and visual and auditory perturbations on medio-lateral ( ML) and anterior-posterior ( AP) margins of stability ( MoS) in young and older adults. We aimed to evaluate ( 1) which perturbation type disturbed the gait pattern substantially , ( 2) how participants recovered , and ( 3) whether recovery responses could discriminate between young and older adults. Nine young ( 25.1 ± 3.4 years) and nine older ( 70.1 ± 7.6 years) adults walked on the CAREN Extended ( Motek BV , The Netherlands). The perturbation effect was quantified by deviation in MoS over six post-perturbation steps compared to baseline walking. Contra-lateral sway and deceleration perturbations resulted in the largest ML ( 1.9-4 times larger than other types) and AP ( 1.6-5.6 times larger than other types) perturbation effects , respectively. After both perturbation types , participants increased MoS by taking wider , shorter , and faster steps. No differences between young and older adults were found. We suggest to evaluate the potential of using contra-lateral sway and deceleration perturbations for fall risk identification by including both healthy and frail older adults.
