 This study aims to explore a relationship between exposures of whole-cell Porphyromonas<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> in various doses with atopic inflammatory responses at experimental mice. A pretest-posttest controlled group design , with 16 Wistar rats ( Rattus<pathogen> novergicus) randomized into four groups. Group 1 was the control group. Group 2 was given low-dose ( 9 Ã— 10 We introduced and explained the potential role of periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> in systemic immune responses , along with its virulence factor inside the oral cavity. Our results consider several changes and differences of cytokines and immunoglobulins following whole-cell Porphyromonas<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> exposure. However , results of the study need to be interpreted with caution due to its limitations. Interleukin ( IL) -4 and IL-5 had been found increase after exposure to the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> , whereas no or minimal change had been found in the level of IL-17F , Ig-G
