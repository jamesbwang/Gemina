 Echinocandins are fungicidal and more active than fluconazole against Candida biofilms. This is known to be an important mechanism for Candida persistence. However , there is limited evidence of effectiveness of echinocandins for treating persistent candidemia. We prospectively observed adult patients with persistent candidemia from March 2011 to February 2016. This was defined as the isolation of the same Candida<pathogen> species for â‰¥ 5 days from blood cultures. We used a time-dependent analysis to evaluate the impact of definitive therapy on mycological eradication and overall survival at 30 days from the index date ( the date of collecting the second positive blood culture). We screened 1162 episodes of candidemia. Of 196 non-duplicate patients enrolled , 64 received echinocandins and 132 received fluconazole as their first definitive therapy after the index date. The rates of mycological eradication and overall survival were 67.3 % and 55.6 % , respectively. The factors associated with mycological eradication included receipt of an echinocandin as the definitive therapy , adequate source control , and not receiving parenteral hyperalimentation. The factors related to overall survival were APACHE II , not receiving corticosteroids , and receiving cardiovascular or abdominal surgery. Echinocandins were more effective than fluconazole in achieving mycological eradication in patients with persistent candidemia.
