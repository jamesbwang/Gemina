 Studies focusing on the originating patterns of the deep inferior epigastric artery ( DIEA) have not been conducted. Here , we analyzed the vascular anatomy of the DIEA with computed tomographic angiography ( CTA) to provide assistance during proximal pedicle dissection of a DIEA-based flap. We conducted a retrospective study on patients who had undergone breast reconstruction with the transverse rectus<pathogen> abdominis musculocutaneous flap and the deep inferior epigastric perforator flap from March 2006 to October 2016. Preoperative three-dimensional computed tomographic angiograms of the abdominal wall ( hemi-abdominal walls) were employed in this study , and three independent surgeons reviewed all CTA images. The originating angles and the distance from the originating point to the DIEA turning point were analyzed. Moreover , we assessed the relationship between the measured values and patients ' characteristics , such as abdominal surgery history. CTA data of 184 patients and 368 hemiabdomens were reviewed and analyzed. Most of the DIEAs originated from the external iliac artery in the medial direction , proceeded caudally , and curved in a cephalic direction. The average descending length was 11.29 mm. As the DIEA origin angle decreased ( toward the caudal direction) , the distance of the initial descent increased ( r = 0.382 , p < 0.01). In addition , the descending length was significantly larger ( p < 0.01) in the operation group ( 12.22 mm) than in the non-operation group ( 9.86 mm). Surgeons should consider DIEA-originating patterns to ensure safe pedicle dissection during flap elevation.
