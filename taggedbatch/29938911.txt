 There is a paucity of literature related to the prevalence of Paroxysmal Nocturnal haemoglobinuria ( PNH) clones in paediatric aplastic anaemia ( AA) patients. We performed a retrospective analysis over a period of 42 months to study the prevalence of PNH clones in paediatric ( age less than 18 years) AA cases , using Fluorescein-labelled proaerolysin-based flow cytometric screening and analysed their clinico-pathological features. PNH clone was identified in 100 ( 33.2 %) of the 301 patients screened. These were comprised of 51 cases of non-severe AA , 33 cases of severe AA and 16 cases of very severe AA. The median age was 13 years with an M: F ratio of 2.5:1. The median clone size ( taken as the proportion of PNH-positive neutrophils) was 2.15 % ( range: 0.05 % -93.1 %). Although a majority of patients ( n = 77) had a clone size of less than 10 % , a significant proportion ( n = 23) did harbour a clone size of more than 10 %. Evidence of haemolysis was observed in 3 patients , all of them having a clone size of more than 10 %. Interestingly , 1 patient with dural sinus thrombosis harboured a clone size of 1.25 % only. Chromosomal breakage analysis was performed in 61 patients , none of which was positive. Complete and partial response to immunosuppressive therapy was found in 55.1 % patients ( 16/29). There is a high prevalence of PNH clones in paediatric AA patients , which in a majority of cases are of small clone sizes. The use of immunosuppressive therapy does not show a better outcome as compared to PNH-negative cases.
