 A sound breeding objective is the basis for genetic improvement in overall economic merit of farm animals. Begait goat is one of the identified breeds in Ethiopia , which is a multipurpose breed as it serves as source of cash income and source of food ( meat and milk). Despite its importance , no formal breeding objectives exist for Begait goat. The objective of the present study was to identify breeding objectives for the breed through two approaches: using own-flock ranking experiment and developing deterministic bio-economic models as a preliminary step towards designing sustainable breeding programs for the breed. In the own-flock ranking experiment , a total of 45 households were visited at their homesteads and were asked to select , with reasons , the first best , second best , third best , and the most inferior does from their own flock. Age , previous reproduction , and production information of the identified animals were inquired; live body<symptom> weight and some linear body measurements were taken. The bio-economic model included performance traits ( weights , daily weight gain , kidding interval , litter size , milk yield , kid mortality , pregnancy , and replacement rates) and economic ( revenue and costs) parameters. It was observed that there was close agreement between the farmers ' ranking and bio-economic model results. In general , the results of the present study indicated that Begait goat owners could improve performance of their goats and profitability of their farms by selecting for 6-month weight , litter size , pre-weaning kid survival rate , and milk yield.
