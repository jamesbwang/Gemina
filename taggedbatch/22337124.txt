 To combine the advantages of ultrafast femtosecond nano-optics with an on-chip communication scheme , optical signals with a frequency of several hundreds of THz need to be down-converted to coherent electronic signals propagating on-chip. So far , this has not been achieved because of the overall slow response time of nanoscale electronic circuits. Here , we demonstrate that 14 fs optical pulses in the near-infrared can drive electronic on-chip circuits with a prospective bandwidth up to 10 THz. The corresponding electronic pulses propagate in macroscopic striplines on a millimeter scale. We exploit femtosecond photoswitches based on asymmetric , nanoscale metal junctions to drive the pulses. The non-linear ultrafast response is based on a plasmonically enhanced , multiphoton absorption resulting in a field emission of ballistic hot electrons propagating across the nanoscale junctions. Our results pave the way towards femtosecond electronics integrated in wafer-scale THz circuits.
