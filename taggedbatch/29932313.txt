 The aim was to evaluate the evolution of transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance ( TDR) prevalence in antiretroviral therapy ( ART)- naïve patients from 2006 to 2016. HIV-1 sequences were retrieved from the Antiviral Response Cohort Analysis ( ARCA) database and TDR was defined as detection of at least one mutation from the World Health Organization ( WHO) surveillance list. We included protease/reverse transcriptase sequences from 3573 patients; 455 had also integrase sequences. Overall , 68.1 % of the patients were Italian , the median CD4 count was 348 cells/μL ( interquartile range ( IQR) 169-521 cells/μL) , and the median viral load was 4.7 log The prevalence of HIV-1 TDR has declined during the last 10 years in Italy.
