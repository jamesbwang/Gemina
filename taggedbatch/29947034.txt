 A range of important small seeded C We conducted carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of modern and historical pearl millet ( Pennisetum glaucum , n = 108) and finger millet ( Eleusine coracana , n = 17) seed samples sourced from the United States Department of Agriculture as well as the Harlan Collection curated at the Crop Evolution Laboratory Herbarium at the University of Illinois. The millet species have significantly different mean carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios over broad temporal and spatial scales. We also found substantial isotopic variation within species ( range of 1.9 ‰ and 8.5 ‰ in δ The importance of both temperature and precipitation as predictors of δ
