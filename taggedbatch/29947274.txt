 Background and purpose- Arthrodesis is the most common treatment of severe<symptom> ankle arthritis<disease><symptom>. Large studies on the occurrence of re-arthrodesis are few , especially with information in terms of risk. We used the National Swedish Ankle Registry to assess incidence and risk factors for re-arthrodesis. Patients and methods- In the Registry , we examined the occurrence of re-arthrodesis in 1,716 patients with a primary ankle arthrodesis. We also analyzed associations between the re-arthrodesis risk and sex , diagnosis , and surgical method. Results- The risk of first re-arthrodesis at 2.5 years was 7.4 % and the rate at 9 years 7.8 %. The risk following arthroscopic surgery with fixation by screws was 15 % , which is statistically significantly higher than the 8 % following the gold standard technique with open screw fixation , the 5 % following fixation by intramedullary nailing , and the 3 % following fixation by plate and screws. Patients with either idiopathic osteoarthritis or posttraumatic arthritis<disease><symptom> had a higher risk of re-arthrodesis than patients with rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom>. We could not find that the risk of re-arthrodesis was associated with sex. Interpretation- In Sweden , the re-arthrodesis risk varied by primary technique and was especially high after arthroscopic surgery. Reasons are unknown but poor surgical technique and/or surgeon inexperience may contribute , as may patient selection.
