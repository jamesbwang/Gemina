 CD300A is a member of the CD300 glycoprotein family of cell surface proteins involved in immune response signaling pathways. There is evidence that CD300A plays a role in autophagy and angiogenesis , while , no studies have been reported which investigated the role of CD300A in tumors. CD300A was found to be highly expressed with statistical significance in acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) , as well as associated with prognosis , through the analysis of differential expression genes using the TCGA and GTEx database. A decrease in CD300A expression could promote apoptosis and inhibit proliferation and migration of AML cell line U937 , as well as promote the activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway. These results demonstrated that CD300A operated as a tumor promoter in AML cells. We further analyzed coexpression genes of CD300A and then screened two genes , ADCY7 and PECAM1 , which were both overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in AML. Meanwhile , CD300A increased the expression of PECAM1 and ADCY7 in U937 cells. Furthermore , we demonstrated that PECAM1 promoted the proliferation and migration and inhibited the apoptosis of U937 cells. ADCY7 participated in the regulation of proliferation and migration , but not apoptosis , in U937 cells. Both PECAM1 and ADCY7 promoted tumor progression through the AKT pathway , showing the same molecular mechanism as CD300A. To summarize , we , for the first time , confirmed that CD300A promoted tumor progression by increase PECAM1 and ADCY7 expression , and activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in AML. It is suggested CD300A is an oncogene and potential therapeutic target for AML.
