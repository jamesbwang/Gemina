 Implantable cardioverter defibrillators for both primary and secondary prevention have been successful in decreasing sudden cardiac death. The Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Registry was established partly for reimbursement for primary prevention. However , the registry also has been helpful in better understanding the risks and appropriate selection of patients to receive these devices , serving as an impetus for quality improvement by giving outcome information to the contributing institutions regarding their performance relative to the national results , and increasing research. It is also expected to be helpful to compare results from different devices and provide information to the public.
