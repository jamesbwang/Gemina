 Magnetic multilayer devices , showing large magnetoresistance ( MR) effects , have revolutionized magnetic sensing and data storage sectors over the last few decades. Two-dimensional van der Waals layered materials are relatively new entrants in this area , and these materials can give rise to large MR effects with diverse physical origins. Here we report observation of giant MR switching ( âˆ¼ 10 orders of magnitude) in multilayered graphene grown on cobalt ( Co) substrates , which persists even at room temperature. The origin of this effect is linked with weak interlayer coupling of the graphene stacks , which gives rise to an ` interlayer MR ' effect. This effect is found to be robust against some degree of inhomogeneity in the graphene stack , making it an attractive platform for the emerging area of flexible magnetic sensorics.
