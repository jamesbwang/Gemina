 To ensure identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive ( ALK A budget impact model was developed by adopting the Italian National Health Service ( NHS) perspective and a 5-year period to compare 2 scenarios: the current use of D5F3 ( 28 %; current scenario) and increased use of D5F3 ( 60 %; alternative scenario). The testing cost and the number and cost of the identified ALK A more extensive use of D5F3 in the alternative scenario showed a decrease in diagnostic costs of âˆ¼ $ 468,000 compared with current scenario when considering all advanced NSCLC patients. If these savings were allocated to test more NSCLC patients ( 75 % vs. 53 %) , an incremental cost per identified ALK The use of D5F3 would provide a cost savings for the NHS owing to a lower acquisition cost than FISH and a comparable detection rate. The savings could be reinvested to test a greater number of patients , leading to more efficient identification , use of targeted therapy , and improvement in clinical outcomes of ALK
