 To identify surrogate markers for prognosis of breast cancer patients with non-pathological complete response ( non-pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC) , our investigation focused on serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA) and carbohydrate antigen ( CA15-3) as well as clinicopathological factors both pre- and post-NAC. A total of 185 breast cancer patients treated with NAC were recruited. Serum CEA and CA15-3 were measured at baseline and at completion of NAC. Among the non-pCR cancers ( n = 142) , disease-free survival ( DFS) of patients with CA15-3-low at baseline ( 3-year DFS: 0.908 , n = 73) was significantly better than of those with CA15-3-high ( 3-year DFS: 0.681 , n = 69 , P = 0.0134). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that baseline CA15-3 levels ( hazard ratio ( HR): 3.31 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.28-10.23; P = 0.0122) and residual invasive size ( HR: 4.47 , 1.26-28.39; P = 0.0171) were significant independent factors for DFS. The combination of these factors proved to be accurate predictor for DFS regardless of breast cancer subtypes. The combination of residual invasive size and serum CA15-3 levels at baseline seems to be a significant and independent surrogate marker of poor outcome for patients with non-pCR. These findings suggest that these markers may be useful for identifying patients with inferior prognosis and candidates for additional adjuvant treatments.
