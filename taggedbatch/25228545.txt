 To determine the intra-session and inter-session reproducibility of corneal , macular and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness ( RNFL) measurements with the iVue-100 optical coherence tomography in normal eyes. These parameters were measured in the right eyes of 50 healthy participants with normal vision. Six scans each for corneal thickness , macular and optic nerve head were taken on one day ( intra-session) , followed by similar repeated measures on five separate days ( inter-session). Reproducibility was computed using intra-class correlation coefficient ( ICC) , coefficient of variation ( COV) , and test-retest variability ( TRV). For intra-session reproducibility , the ICC , COV and TRV values for mean corneal thickness were 0.924 , 2.82 % , and 3.06 µm respectively. For the mean macular thickness , they were 0.978 , 4.64 % and 4.51 µm respectively , while for mean RNFL thickness they were 0.946 , 3.19 % , and 5.66 µm respectively. Inter-session values for mean corneal thickness were 0.926 , 2.65 % and 3.48 µm , and 0.916 , 2.24 % and 2.03 µm for mean macular thickness. For mean RNFL thickness , they were 0.962 , 2.21 % , and 4.72 µm respectively. There was good reproducibility of all measured parameters. However , mean RNFL thickness measurements were the most reproducible , suggesting that this may be the best parameter to use to determine measured changes over time.
