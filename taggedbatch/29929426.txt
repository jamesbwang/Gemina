 The degradation of misfolded , ubiquitinated proteins is essential for cellular homeostasis. These proteins are primarily degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system ( UPS) and macroautophagy/autophagy serves as a backup mechanism when the UPS is overloaded. How autophagy and the UPS are coordinated is not fully understood. During the autophagy of misfolded , ubiquitinated proteins , referred to as aggrephagy , substrate proteins are clustered into larger structures in a SQSTM1/p62-dependent manner before they are sequestered by phagophores , the precursors to autophagosomes. We have recently shown that SQSTM1/p62 and ubiquitinated proteins spontaneously phase separate into micrometer-sized clusters in vitro. This enabled us to characterize the properties of the ubiquitin-positive substrates that are necessary for the SQSTM1/p62-mediated cluster formation. Our results suggest that aggrephagy is triggered by the accumulation of substrates with multiple ubiquitin chains and that the process can be inhibited by active proteasomes.
