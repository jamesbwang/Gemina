 Diabetes mellitus ( DM) was prone to happening in posterior circulation infarction ( POCI) and DM also has the impact on the lipids , our study was to investigate the correlation between lipid compositions and POCI. Data was collected from the patients with acute ischemic stroke ( AIS) hospitalization in Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School from October 2008 to May 2012. Lipids and other risk factors in the different populations were investigated in relation to occurrence of POCI based on the infarction location. Six hundred ten patients with AIS were included in this study , which had 428 with anterior circulation infarction ( ACI) and 182 with POCI. Elevated Triglyceride ( TG) and decreased High density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) were seen in the POCI of total populations and AIS without DM compared to the ACI , but not in the populations of AIS with DM , so did the elevated TG/HDL-C ratios. Also , the percent of low HDL-C level and high TG level were higher in POCI group than that in ACI group. Furthermore , single factors logistic regression demonstrated that TG , HDL-C and TG/HDL-C ratio were correlated to the POCI whatever in the total populations or AIS without DM , but this kind of trend just maintained in the populations of AIS without DM after adjusting by relative interference factors. Dyslipidaemia was prone to happening in POCI compared to ACI in the non-diabetic populations , which was correlated to the pathogenesis of POCI.
