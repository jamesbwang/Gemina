 Semiconducting two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides are considered promising gas-sensing materials because of their large surface-to-volume ratio , excellent electrical conductivity , and susceptible surfaces. However , enhancement of the recovery performance has not yet been intensively explored. In this study , a large-area uniform WSe
