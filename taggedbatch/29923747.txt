 In this case study , a formative evaluation was conducted for `` Promoting Food Security and Healthy Lifestyles '' pilot intervention at a Community-Based Organization in a marginalized neighborhood in Bedford-Stuyvesant in New<pathogen> York City. Utilizing a rigorous , theoretically grounded , and mixed methods approach , a survey was designed to encompass the social , environmental , and behavioral determinants of food insecurity and health promotion for Emergency Food Assistance System users. The final survey tested well for face and content validity and meets the criteria for internal reliability. This will aid to develop culturally tailored programs and policies for low-income , food insecure populations facing social and health disparities in this large urban neighborhood.
