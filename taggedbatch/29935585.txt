 Both the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures play important roles in consciousness<symptom>. Some evidence points to general anaesthesia-induced unconsciousness being associated with distinct patterns of superficial cortical electrophysiological oscillations , but how general anaesthetics influence deep brain neural oscillations and interactions between oscillations in humans is poorly understood. Local field potentials were recorded in discrete deep brain regions , including anterior cingulate cortex , sensory thalamus , and periaqueductal grey , in humans with implanted deep brain electrodes during induction of unconsciousness with propofol. Power-frequency spectra , phase-amplitude coupling , coherence , and directed functional connectivity analysis were used to characterise local field potentials in the awake and unconscious states. An increase in alpha ( 7-13 Hz) power and decrease in gamma ( 30-90 Hz) power were observed in both deep cortical ( ACC , anterior cingulate cortex) and subcortical ( sensory thalamus , periaqueductal grey) areas during propofol-induced unconsciousness. Robust alpha-low gamma ( 30-60 Hz) phase-amplitude coupling induced by general anaesthesia was observed in the anterior cingulate cortex but not in other regions studied. Moreover , alpha oscillations during unconsciousness were highly coherent within the anterior cingulate cortex , and this rhythm exhibited a bidirectional information flow between left and right anterior cingulate cortex but stronger left-to-right flow. Propofol increases alpha oscillations and attenuates gamma oscillations in both cortical and subcortical areas. The alpha-gamma phase-amplitude coupling and the functional connectivity of alpha oscillations in the anterior cingulate cortex could be specific markers for loss of consciousness<symptom>.
