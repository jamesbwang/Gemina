 High levels of pairwise linkage disequilibrium ( LD) in single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) array or whole-genome sequence data may affect both performance and efficiency of genomic prediction models. Thus , this warrants pruning of genotyping data for high LD. We developed an algorithm , named SNPrune , which enables the rapid detection of any pair of SNPs in complete or high LD throughout the genome. LD , measured as the squared correlation between phased alleles ( r SNPrune removed a similar number of SNPs as PLINK from the pig data but SNPrune was almost 12 times faster than PLINK. From the simulated sequence data with 10.8 million SNPs , SNPrune removed 6.4 and 1.4 million SNPs due to complete and high LD. Results were very similar regardless of whether phased alleles or allele counts were used. Using allele counts and multi-threading with 10 threads , SNPrune completed the analysis in 21 min. Using a sliding window of up to 500,000 SNPs , PLINK removed ~ 43,000 less SNPs ( 0.6 %) in the sequence data and SNPrune was 24 to 170 times faster , using one or ten threads , respectively. The SNPrune algorithm developed here is able to remove SNPs in high LD throughout the genome very efficiently in large datasets.
