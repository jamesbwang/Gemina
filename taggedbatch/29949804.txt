 The purpose of our case control study is to explore the potential association of tumor protein 53 ( TP53) c. 215G > C , p. ( Arg72Pro) polymorphism ( rs1042522) with the risk of breast cancer ( BC) development in the Moroccan population. The study population consisted of 125 female patients with confirmed BC and 126 healthy controls. DNA samples were genotyped by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism assay method using BstUI restriction enzyme. We showed that the homozygous genotype of TP53 72Pro variant was significantly associated with increased BC risk ( OR 2.2 , 95 % CI 1.07-4.54 , p = 0.03). The dominant and additive models of TP53 Pro allele were also correlated to the risk of BC ( OR 2.13 , 95 % CI 1.07-4.23 , p = 0.02 and OR 1.49 , 95 % CI 1.03-2.16 , p = 0.03 , respectively). Furthermore , the TP53 Arg72 variant was associated with protection against BC , either in the homozygous genotype , the dominant or the additive models ( OR 0.45 , 95 % CI 0.22-0.93 , p = 0.03; OR 0.46 , 95 % CI 0.23-0.92 , p = 0.029 and OR 0.67 , 95 % CI 0.46-0.97 , p = 0.03 , respectively). Our results suggest that TP53 c. 215G > C , p. ( Arg72Pro) polymorphism may be considered as a genetic marker for predisposition to BC in Moroccan population.
