 In June 2016 , we continued surveillance for tick-borne viruses in eastern Kansas following upon a larger surveillance program initiated in 2015 in response to a fatal human case of Bourbon virus ( BRBV) ( Family Orthomyxoviridae: Genus Thogotovirus). In 4 d , we collected 14,193 ticks representing four species from four sites. Amblyomma<pathogen> americanum<pathogen> ( L.) ( Acari: Ixodidae) accounted for nearly all ticks collected ( n = 14,116 , 99.5 %) , and the only other species identified were Amblyomma<pathogen> maculatum<pathogen> Koch ( Acari: Ixodidae) , Dermacentor<pathogen> variabilis<pathogen> ( Say) ( Acari: Ixodidae) and Ixodes<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> Say ( Acari: Ixodidae). All ticks were tested for both BRBV and Heartland<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( Family Bunyaviridae: Genus Phlebovirus<pathogen>) in 964 pools. Five Heartland<pathogen> virus<pathogen> positive tick pools were detected and confirmed by real-time reverse transcription PCR ( rRT-PCR) , while all pools tested negative for BRBV. Each Heartland<pathogen> positive pool was composed of 25 A.<pathogen> americanum<pathogen> nymphs with positive pools collected at three different sites in Bourbon County. A.<pathogen> americanum<pathogen> is believed to be the primary vector of both Heartland<pathogen> and BRBVs to humans based upon multiple detections of virus in field-collected ticks , its abundance , and its aggressive feeding behavior on mammals including humans. However , it is possible that A.<pathogen> americanum<pathogen> encounters viremic vertebrate hosts of BRBV less frequently than viremic hosts of Heartland<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , or that BRBV is less efficiently passed among ticks by co-feeding , or less efficiently passed vertically from infected female ticks to their offspring resulting in lower field infection rates.
