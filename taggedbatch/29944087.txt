 Purpose To evaluate ex vivo mercury release from dental amalgam after 7.0-T and 1.5-T MRI. Materials and Methods The authors evaluated 60 caries-free molar or premolar teeth that had been extracted for clinical indications. Two-sided cavities were opened in each tooth and amalgam fillings applied. After 9 days , two groups of 20 randomly selected teeth were placed in 20 mL of artificial saliva immediately followed by 20 minutes of MRI exposure at 1.5 or 7.0 T. A control group of teeth was placed in artificial saliva without undergoing MRI exposure. The teeth were removed from the artificial saliva 24 hours later , and the saliva was analyzed for mercury content by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the mean mercury values among the three independent groups , and the Tukey test was used for multiple comparisons of the mean values. Results The mean mercury content of the artificial saliva was 673 μg/L ± 179 in the 7.0-T MRI group , 172 μg/L ± 60 in the 1.5-T MRI group , and 141 μg/L ± 152 in the control group. The mercury content in the 7.0-T group was greater than that in both the 1.5-T group ( P < .001; 95 % confidence interval: 368 μg/L , 633 μg/L) and the control group ( P < .001; 95 % confidence interval: 416 μg/L , 648 μg/L). There was no statistically significant difference in mercury content between the 1.5-T and control groups ( P = .84; 95 % confidence interval: -164 μg/L , 110 μg/L). Conclusion In an ex vivo setting , mercury was released from amalgam fillings after exposure to 7.0-T MRI but not 1.5-T MRI.
