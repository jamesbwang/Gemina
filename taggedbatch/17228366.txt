 Kidney transplant survival benefits are not observed for around 8 months after transplantation because of a higher complications rate in early post-transplant periods. This study compares survival of patients awaiting transplantation with survival of transplant recipients and non-listed dialysis patients in Ireland. In this retrospective analysis , the relative-risk ( RR) of death was assessed with time-dependent , non-proportional hazards analysis , with adjustment for age , cause of end-stage kidney disease ( ESKD) , time from first treatment for ESKD to placement on the waiting list and year of initial placement on the list. A total of 3597 patients were included. Annual death rates per 100 patient-years at risk for all patients on dialysis , waiting-list patients and transplant recipients were 16.5 , 2.4 and 1.2 , respectively. Death rate was highest among diabetics. The relative risk of death for all patients on dialysis was five times higher than the waiting-list patients ( RR , 4.90; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 3.70-6.52; P < 0.001). Time to survival equilibration was 1 year. Thereafter , the 5-year mortality risk was estimated to be 47 % lower than that of the patients on the waiting list ( RR , 0.53; 95 % CI , 0.37-0.77; P = 0.001). Transplant recipients had a higher risk of death initially , but a better long-term survival. Time to death risk equilibration was longer compared with other studies. This could be explained by better survival rates in our waiting-list cohort.
