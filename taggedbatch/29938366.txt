 Most beneficial services provided by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> ( AMF) , encompassing improved crop performance and soil resource availability , are mediated by AMF-associated bacteria , showing key-plant growth-promoting ( PGP) traits , i.e. , the production of indole acetic acid , siderophores and antibiotics , and activities increasing the availability of plant nutrients by nitrogen fixation and phosphate mobilization. Such functions may be affected by the ability of AMF-associated bacteria to communicate through the production and secretion of extracellular small diffusible chemical signals , N-acyl homoserine lactone signal molecules ( AHLs) , that regulate bacterial behavior at the community level ( quorum sensing , QS). This work investigated the occurrence and extent of QS among rhizobia isolated from AMF spores , using two different QS reporter strains , Agrobacterium<pathogen> tumefaciens<pathogen> NTL4 pZRL4 and Chromobacterium<pathogen> violaceum<pathogen> CV026. We also assessed the quorum quenching ( QQ) activity among Bacillus<pathogen> isolated from the same AMF spores. Most rhizobia were found to be quorum-signaling positive , including six isolates producing very high levels of AHLs. The results were confirmed by microtiter plate assay , which detected 65 % of the tested bacteria as medium/high AHL producers. A 16S rDNA sequence analysis grouped the rhizobia into two clusters , consistent with the QS phenotype. None of the tested bacteria showed QQ activity able to disrupt the QS signaling , suggesting the absence of antagonism among bacteria living in AMF sporosphere. Our results provide the first evidence of the ability of AMF-associated rhizobia to communicate through QS , suggesting further studies on the potential importance of such a behavior in association with key-plant growth-promoting functions.
