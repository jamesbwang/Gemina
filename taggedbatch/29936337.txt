 Strength , power and muscular endurance tests have been developed as means of assessing people 's physical abilities. However , testing may be expensive or time consuming. A method to reduce the time of physical assessment could be to use predictive algorithms for indirect assessment. The aim of this study will be to determine a relationship between strength , power and muscular endurance in order to identify predictors for an easier and faster assessment. 33 male strength-trained participants ( 22.8 ± 4.6 years , 172.5 ± 6.7 cm , 68.0 ± 10.6 kg) performed a single pull-up ( SPU) and a single push-up ( SPH) and a set of pull-ups ( EPU) and push-ups ( EPH) to exhaustion<symptom>. The participants were divided into three sub-groups according to their training experience. Force ( F) , Power ( P) , Velocity ( V) and relative power ( R-P) , extracted from an accelerometer ( 500 Hz) , were compared between groups ( ANOVA) and a subsequent linear regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of the performance measures. The regression models were able to explain 61 % of the variance with the EPU as dependent variable and the V of the SPU as independent variable and 68 % of the variance with the EPH as dependent variable and EPU as independent variable. In addition , increased performance measures were found according to training experience , in particular regarding muscular endurance of both the EPU and EPH ( p < 0.001 and p < 0.01 , respectively). A significant effect of training experience was also present for the V of the SPU ( p < 0.001). The results indicate that a relation between muscular endurance and velocity is present. The generated equations allow to estimate both the number of EPH and EPU from a SPU. The equations may be helpful to reduce the time of assessment for upper body physical evaluation.
