 The evaluation of mineral oils by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives ( JECFA) provided high acceptable daily intakes for classes largely falling into the mass range strongly accumulated by humans. Because they are roughly 2 orders of magnitude above the present exposure , they authorize strongly increased exposure. An approach based on accumulation seems more adequate. Increased organ weights might be more critical than granulomas<disease>. Aromatic hydrocarbons with 1-2 aromatic rings should be distinguished from those with at least 3 aromatic rings. If mineral oil saturated hydrocarbon limits were low , no limit might be needed for the 1-2 ring aromatics. It should be considered to phase out substantial use of mineral oils in food application.
