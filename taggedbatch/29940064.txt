 Therapeutic approaches that harness the power of the immune system to eliminate cancer cells have produced a paradigm shift in the management of a variety of malignancies. Prostate cancer has been a particularly active area of investigation in cancer immunotherapy , with significant laboratory and clinical evidence suggesting that this disease can be a viable target for cytotoxic immune cells. In the first article of this series , we discussed the diverse vaccination approaches that have been employed to prime native antigen-specific responses against prostate cancer , highlighting successes such as sipuleucel-T , as well as the significant challenges that remain. Here we focus on alternative methods of harnessing both adaptive and innate antitumor immunity to target prostate cancer cells. Approaches that enhance the activation of T cells , modulation of the tumor microenvironment to abrogate its inherent immunosuppressive mechanisms , and engineering of antigen-specific antibody and cellular products to target tumor cells will be discussed. We will then look ahead to provide a perspective on how this growing collection of immunotherapeutic approaches may ultimately be combined to target prostate cancer from a variety of angles.
