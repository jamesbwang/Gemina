 Metformin is commonly prescribed for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM). We hypothesize that metformin plus androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT) may be beneficial in combination. The objective was to assess this combination in a retrospective cohort of patients with advanced PCa. Using national Veterans Affairs databases , we identified all men diagnosed with PCa between 2000-2008 that were treated with ADT with follow-up through May of 2016. Exclusions included treatment with ADT for â‰¤ 6 months or ADT receipt concurrently with localized radiation. Three patient cohorts were developed: No DM , DM no metformin , and DM on metformin. Cox proportional hazards ratios were calculated for overall survival ( OS) , skeletal-related events ( SRE) and cancer-specific survival ( CSS). The cohort after exclusions consisted of 87,344 patients: 61 % were no DM , 22 % were DM no metformin , and 17 % were DM on metformin. Cox proportional hazards analysis for OS showed improved survival in DM on metformin ( HR 0.82 , 95 % CI 0.78-0.86) vs. DM no metformin ( HR 1.03 , 95 % CI 0.99-1.08) with no DM as referent group. Cox proportional hazards analysis for predictors of SRE revealed HR 0.82 ( 95 % CI 0.72-0.93) for DM on metformin. Cox proportional hazards analysis for CSS showed improved survival in DM on metformin ( HR 0.70 , 95 % CI 0.64-0.77) vs. DM no metformin ( HR 0.93 , 95 % CI 0.85- 1.00) with no DM as referent group. Metformin use in Veterans with PCa receiving ADT is associated with improved oncologic outcomes. This association should be evaluated in a prospective clinical trial.
