 Each year , increasing numbers of children and families seek care for psychiatric crises; unfortunately , most communities offer limited services to meet these needs. Youth in crisis often present to emergency departments , but may not need or benefit from that level of care. Instead , data reflect improved clinical and financial outcomes when communities offer a continuum of crisis services. In this article , the authors present care models from two communities- Ventura County , California , and the state of Connecticut- and review program development , implementation , and monitoring. The authors also highlight principles for leaders to consider in developing these services.
