 Obesity is strongly associated with insulin resistance and elevated plasma glucose levels. The rs9356744 polymorphism in the A total of 2357 participants were enrolled from the Cardiometabolic Risk in Chinese ( CRC) Study , including 499 persons with prediabetes , 204 persons with type 2 diabetes , and 1654 normoglycemic controls. The rs9356744 polymorphism in Despite the positive relationship between obesity and glucose traits , the T allele of rs9356744 , which is associated with a predisposition to obesity , was correlated with lower levels of 2-h oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT) plasma glucose ( 2hPG) ( Î² =- 0.2104 and The
