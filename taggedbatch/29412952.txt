 Dengue<pathogen><disease> is a disease endemic in Latin American countries , like Venezuela , and has become one of the most important public health problems. We report five complete coding sequences of dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> serotype 2 ( DENV-2) isolated from DENV-infected patients in Venezuela. Phylogenetic analysis placed the isolates within the American/Asian genotype.
