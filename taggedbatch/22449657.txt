 Wide variations exist in how physicians manage the nutritional aspects of children affected by acute pancreatitis<disease> ( AP) , acute recurrent pancreatitis<disease> ( ARP) , and chronic ( CP) pancreatitis<disease>. Better consensus for optimal management is needed. This consensus statement on nutrition in pediatric pancreatic diseases was developed through a joint ESPGHAN-NASPGHAN working group that performed an evidence-based search of the literature on nutrition in AP , ARP , and CP with a focus on pediatrics. The literature was summarized , quality of evidence reviewed , and expert recommendations developed. The authorship met to discuss the evidence and statements. Voting on recommendations occurred over 2 rounds based on feedback. A consensus of at least 75 % was required to approve a recommendation. Areas requiring further research were identified. The literature on nutrition in pediatric pancreatitis<disease> is limited. Children with mild AP benefit from starting an early nutritional regimen in the course of the attack. Early nutrition should be attempted in severe AP when possible; enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition. Children with ARP are likely to tolerate and benefit from a regular diet. Children with CP need ongoing assessment for growth and nutritional deficiencies , exocrine and endocrine insufficiencies. This document presents the first authoritative recommendations on nutritional considerations in pediatric pancreatitis<disease>. Future research should address the gaps in knowledge particularly relating to optimal nutrition for AP in children , role of diet or dietary supplements on recurrent attacks of pancreatitis<disease> and pain episodes , monitoring practices to detect early growth and nutritional deficiencies in CP and identifying risk factors that predispose children to these deficiencies.
