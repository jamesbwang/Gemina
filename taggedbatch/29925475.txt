 This study aimed at evaluating changes in the renin-angiotensin system ( RAS) in patients with schizophrenia in comparison with controls. Plasma levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE) , ACE2 , angiotensin ( Ang)- ( 1-7) and Ang II were assessed in 25 patients with schizophrenia and 20 controls. Patients with schizophrenia presented decreased levels of ACE compared to controls ( median ( 25th-75th percentiles) = 434.79 ( 341.15-524.02) vs. 508.49 ( 396.34-608.72); p < 0.05). No significant differences were found regarding ACE2 , Ang- ( 1-7) and Ang II levels. There were no associations between the measured molecules and clinical parameters. Our results corroborate the hypothesis that the RAS is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
