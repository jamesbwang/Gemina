 Given the limited ability of informatics-based assessment technologies to reach individuals with serious mental health conditions , this study evaluated the feasibility and data quality of mail-out healthcare surveys in this population to assist in measure selection for a multi-site controlled implementation trial. Veterans were randomly selected from those who had received services at a mental health clinic in the Department of Veterans Affairs , and were randomly assigned to one of three questionnaire lengths. Survey length ( 48-127 items) was not associated with differences in response rate , percent of items missing , or data quality. However , internal consistency reliability was variable among scales and survey lengths. Additional analyses indicate the above measures of survey data quality may differ among respondents who are non-white and younger and have psychotic disorders. These results can inform survey protocols to ensure maximal representation of this vulnerable population in health planning and policy assessment.
