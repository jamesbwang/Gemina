 The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there is an association between grayanotoxin levels in urine and blood of patients with mad honey intoxication and in the honey consumed , and the resulting clinical picture. The pilot data acquired from this study was analysed in National Forensic Service , Daejeon Institute , South Korea and first results were published as a preliminary study. This descriptive study was conducted at a university hospital emergency department in Turkey. 25 cases diagnosed with mad honey intoxication were obtained the study. Samples of mad honey consumed by patients were obtained. Blood and urine specimens were collected at presentation to the emergency department. GTX 1 and GTX 3 levels from patients ' blood , urine and honey consumed were investigated simultaneously using the LC-MS/MS system. Mean GTX 1 concentration in blood was 4.82 ng/mL and mean GTX 3 level 6.56 ng/mL. Mean GTX concentration in urine was 0.036 μg/mL and mean GTX 3 level 0.391 μg/mL. Mean GTX I concentration in honeys consumed was 8.73 μg/gr and mean GTX 3 level 27.60 μg/gr. This descriptive study is show grayanotoxin levels in body fluids of patients with mad honey intoxication. No association was determined between grayanotoxin levels in blood and clinical data.
