 Pneumothorax is the most frequent severe acupuncture-related adverse event occurring at the GB 21 acupoint. This study used ultrasonography ( US) to measure the depth of the GB 21 acupoint in adults and assessed its applicability for ensuring safe acupuncture practices. A US probe was used to measure the vertical depth from the skin<symptom> to the pleural line of the apex of the lungs at the right and left GB 21 acupoints. The sex , age , body<symptom> weight , height , and body mass index ( BMI) of each person were recorded. Student 's t test and generalized estimating equations were used for statistical analysis. Sixty women and 41 men with a median age of 29 years were included in this study. The depth of GB 21 increased with body<symptom> weight , height , and BMI ( P < 0.001). The mean depth of GB 21 in men ( 17.4 mm) was deeper than that in women ( 14.6 mm; P < 0.001). The depth difference between the right and left shoulders was significant in men ( P < 0.001) but not women. US can be used to measure GB 21 acupoint depth. Further control studies on its use to ensure safe clinical practices , including preventing acupuncture-related pneumothorax , are warranted.
