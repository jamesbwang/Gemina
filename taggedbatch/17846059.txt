 The present retrospective study was designed to compare the pain relief , surgery duration , life quality , survival time and relative prognostic factors in multiple myeloma ( MM) bone disease patients with different surgical<disease> sites. A total of 65 cases were enrolled and divided into two groups. Group A included patients with lesions<symptom> located in the spine , while Group B included patients with lesions<symptom> located in the long bone or soft<disease> tissue. Pain relief was measured by the visual analogue scale ( VAS) , neurological impairment was determined according to Frankel classification , and survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression analysis was also used to estimate the effect of factors on the prediction of survival. The hospitalization time , preoperative duration of symptoms , method of surgery , complications , recurrence and survival time were evaluated and compared retrospectively. Pain relief and improvement of life quality were observed in all the patients in groups A and B. No significant differences were detected for the majority of parameters compared between groups A and B , with the exception of the surgery duration , as well as the postoperative VAS score at 1 and 6 months after surgery. The multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed several risk factors significantly associated with survival , including the preoperative VAS score , postoperative chemotherapy , prothrombin time activity ( PTA) , albumin , lactate dehydrogenase and urine protein level. In conclusion , surgical treatment was an effective therapeutic method in patients with MM. Postoperative analgesic use should be individualized according to the different surgical<disease> sites and postoperative periods. Furthermore , preoperative pain , PTA , albumin , urine protein level and postoperative chemotherapy are associated with prognosis.
