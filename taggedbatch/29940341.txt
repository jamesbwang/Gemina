 A series of azolyl flavonoids were synthesized and characterized by NMR , IR , MS and HRMS spectra. All the newly prepared compounds were screened for their potential protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitory activities. Bioactive assay manifested that most of the azolyl flavonoids exhibited good protein phosphatase 1B ( PTP1B) inhibitory activities. Especially , triazolyl flavonoid 6a displayed the best inhibitory activity ( IC
