 To describe the experiences of people living with multimorbidity in New Zealand. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adults with multimorbidity enrolled in two primary health organisations in New Zealand. Potential participants with multimorbidity were identified using retrospective hospital discharge data coded for long-term conditions. Sampling was stratified by ethnicity ( Māori , Pacific and non-Māori/non-Pacific). Analysis was descriptive , with some responses compared to the general population estimates from the New Zealand Health Survey. A total of 234 participants completed the survey ( mean age 65.2). Self-reported physical health was poor among the cohort: forty-one percent of participants reported only ` fair ' or ` poor ' general health , compared to 13.5 % in the general population ( age and sex standardised) , with similar results for both self-reported mental health and physical health. Self-reported health was poorer for Māori and Pacific participants. The majority ( 70 %) of those who were working reported their health had affected their productivity , while nearly 20 % of participants reported financial difficulty in taking care of their health needs. These results emphasise the serious impact multimorbidity has on patients ' health status compared to the general population. This research supports the development of holistic patient-centred care models designed to improve patient outcomes.
