 Camouflage is a key defensive strategy in animals , and it has been used to illustrate and study evolution for 150 years. It is now evident that many camouflage concepts likely also apply to plants , attracting greatly increased attention. Here , we review the hypotheses and evidence for different camouflage strategies used by plants and conceptualise the state of play in plant concealment under a general framework of camouflage theory. In addition , we compare the camouflage strategies used by plants and animals , outline key factors promoting and constraining the evolution of concealment , and highlight the evolutionary and ecological implications of plant camouflage. Ultimately , we show how plant camouflage exhibits many commonalities with animals and how this understudied parallel phenomenon can inform key questions in ecology and evolution.
