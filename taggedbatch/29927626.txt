 Salmonella<pathogen><disease> enterica<pathogen> subspecies enterica<pathogen> serotype Enteritidis<pathogen> ( S.<pathogen> Enteritidis<pathogen>) is one of the leading causes for human salmonellosis all over the world. We analyzed the surveillance data of 18 years on antimicrobial resistance profiling of S.<pathogen> Enteritidis<pathogen> collected and isolated by the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System ( NARMS) from humans , chicken , and chicken breasts<disease>. Statistical tool based on the unique individual antibiotic minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC) profiling was used to compare antimicrobial resistance in the isolates. A machine-learning algorithm , Random Forest matrix , segregated a collection of 6819 S.<pathogen> Enteritidis<pathogen> into multiple populations. The MIC value of 13 common antibiotics to individual isolate when taken as the best classifier , resulted in two distinct groups represented herein as Population-I and Population-II. Population-I , which spread within a small tight cluster , comprised all the chicken and chicken breasts<disease> ' isolates as well as about 13.4 % of the human isolates , whereas the Population-II consisted of the human isolates only , with a larger spread over wider area away from the Population-I ( p < 0.001). Few overlapping , yet diverse clusters between humans and chicken as well as higher level of resistance of chicken breast isolate toward third-generation cephalosporins and tetracyclines compared to those from human isolates , highlight differences in their population structure. These findings indicate a complex driver for enriching antibiotic-resistant Salmonella<pathogen><disease> in the food-chain other than those of chicken origin. This warrants for other strategies in addition to the judicious/restricted use of antibiotics to mitigate the threat of antimicrobial resistance.
