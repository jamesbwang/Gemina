 The objective of our study was to systematically review the evidence about synchronous colorectal cancer diagnosed with or without computed tomography colonography ( CTC). Two systematic searches were performed ( PubMed and EMBASE) for studies reporting the prevalence of synchronous colorectal cancer ( CRC): one considering patients who underwent CTC and the another one considering patients who did not undergo CTC. A three-level analysis was performed to determine the prevalence of patients with synchronous CRC in both groups of studies. Heterogeneity was explored for multiple variables. Pooled prevalence and 95 % confidence interval ( CI) were calculated. A quality assessment ( STROBE) was done for the studies. For CTC studies , among 2645 articles initially found , 21 including 1673 patients , published from 1997 to 2018 , met the inclusion criteria. For non-CTC studies , among 6192 articles initially found , 27 including 111,873 patients published from 1974 to 2015 met the inclusion criteria. The pooled synchronous CRC prevalence was 5.7 % ( 95 % CI 4.7 % -7.1 %) for CTC studies , and 3.9 % ( 95 % CI 3.3 % -4.4 %) for non-CTC studies , with a significant difference ( p = 0.004). A low heterogeneity was found for the CTC group ( I The prevalence of synchronous CRC was about 4-6 %. The introduction of CTC is associated with a significant increase of the prevalence of synchronous CRCs.
