 FOXM1 is a key member of the FOX transcription factor family , which plays a vital role in a series of physiological processes. In the present study , non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) patients and cell lines were studied to explore the correlation between FOXM1 expression and this malignancy. The expression status of FOXM1 was detected in 128 cases of NSCLC tissues and NSCLC cell lines. The relationship of FOXM1 expression and clinicopathological features of NSCLC patients was evaluated by us. In addition , we also explored the biological functions of FOXM1 in NSCLC cell lines. The FOXM1 is highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. FOXM1 expression was closely correlated with lymph node status and TNM stage. Cox regression analysis were performed to demonstrate the prognosis role of FOXM1. FOXM1 conferred a proliferation and invasion advantage to NSCLC cell. The FOXM1 can be regarded as an important molecular marker in NSCLC prognosis.
