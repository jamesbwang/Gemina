 Aspirin is one of the oldest drugs for the treatment of inflammation<symptom> , fever<symptom> , and pain. It is reported to covalently modify COX-2 enzyme by acetylating a serine amino acid residue. By virtue of aspirin 's acetylating potential , we for the first time developed novel acetyl-donating HDAC inhibitors. In this study , we report the design , synthesis , in silico docking study , and biological evaluation of acetyl-donating HDAC inhibitors. The exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells with compound 4c significantly promotes the acetylation of Î±-tubulin and histone H3 , which are substrates of HDAC6 and HDAC1 , respectively. In silico docking simulation also indicates that compound 4c tightly binds to the deep substrate-binding pocket of HDAC6 by coordinating the active zinc ion in a bidentate manner and forming hydrogen bond interactions with Ser531 and His573 amino acid residues. In particular , compound 4c ( GI
