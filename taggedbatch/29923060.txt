 We recently demonstrated a protective effect of the farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic acid ( OCA) in rat models of bleomycin-induced pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( PF). Aim of the present study was to investigate whether the positive effects of OCA treatment are apparent also on ongoing bleomycin-induced PF , i.e. , after 2 weeks of bleomycin administration. Bleomycin-induced PF rats were treated 2 weeks after bleomycin administration with OCA or pirfenidone for two additional weeks. Pulmonary function test was performed at 2 and 4 weeks in all experimental groups. At the same time points , lung morphological features and mRNA expression profile of genes related to fibrosis<disease> , inflammation<symptom> and epithelial-mesenchymal transition were also assessed. After 2 weeks , bleomycin significantly increased the pressure at the airway opening ( PAO) , a functional parameter related to fibrosis-induced lung stiffness , and induced diffuse lung interstitium fibrosis<disease> , with upregulation of inflammation<symptom> ( IL1β , MCP1) and tissue remodeling ( COL1A1 , COL3A1 , ET1 , MMP7 , PDGFa , αSMA , SNAI1) markers. At week four , a further increase of lung<disease> fibrosis<disease> and PAO was observed , accompanied by upregulation of extracellular matrix-related mRNA expression. OCA administration , even after the establishment of PF , significantly improved pulmonary function , normalizing PAO , and reverted the bleomycin-induced lung alterations , with significant reduction of markers of inflammation<symptom> ( CD206 , COX2 , HIF1 , IL1β , MCP1) , epithelial proliferation ( CTGF , PDGFa) and fibrosis<disease> ( COL1A1 , COL3A1 , ET1 , FN1 , MMPs , αSMA , SNAIs , TGFβ1 , TIMPs). Results with OCA were similar or superior to those obtained with pirfenidone. In conclusion , our results demonstrate a significant therapeutic effect of OCA in already established PF.
