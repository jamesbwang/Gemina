 Sittace flaviventris Wagler , 1832 was the name given to Azara 's No. 276 `` Maracan√° cabeza y encuentro roxos '' , but since then the identity of the species has remained a mystery. Based on a tail-less domestic individual , it has most often been attributed to an aberrant Aratinga parakeet , and is currently considered a doubtful taxon. In this note the identity of `` Azara 's Parakeet '' is confirmed as Red-spectacled Amazon Amazona pretrei ( Temminck , 1830) , a species that still occurs today in the region from where Azara described it. Sittace flaviventris is thus a junior synonym of Amazona pretrei.
