 Motion in the visual world provides critical information to guide the behavior of sighted animals. Furthermore , as visual motion estimation requires comparisons of signals across inputs and over time , it represents a paradigmatic and generalizable neural computation. Focusing on the Drosophila visual system , where an explosion of technological advances has recently accelerated experimental progress , we review our understanding of how , algorithmically and mechanistically , motion signals are first computed. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Vision Science Volume 4 is September 15 , 2018. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.
