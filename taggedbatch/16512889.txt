 This study aims to develop a protocol that optimizes 18 bovine incisors were cut and polished in enamel/dentin and submitted to staining in coffee solution during 72 hours. After the standardization and staining of the enamel surfaces , three groups ( n = 6) were formed to receive three different gels , WHITENESS ( commercial gel); H2O2- 5 % ( manipulated gel); CARBOPOL GEL ( manipulated gel and without H2O2). The color of the enamel surfaces was evaluated using digital images , obtained with digital camera and controlled luminosity , before and after staining , as well as after each bleaching step. The average bleaching after 48 hours of procedure was: WHITENESS with 13.6 ( ± 1.2); H2O2 ( 5 %) with 9.8 ( ± 1.4) and CARBOPOL GEL with 2.9 ( ± 0.6). After 72 hours , WHITENESS presented a mean of 15.8 ( ± 0.7) , the H2O2 group ( 5 %) 14.4 ( ± 1.5) and CARBOPOL GEL 4.6 ( ± 1.0). After completing 96 hours of whitening , WHITENESS presented an average of 18.3 ( ± 0.8) , H2O2 ( 5 %) 16.7 ( ± 1.4) and CARBOPOL GEL 7.3 ( ± 0.8). Our data demonstrated that the protocol development for us can be used to evaluate dental bleaching in a short time , with 96 hours already was possible to detect significant differences , when compared with the longer times of experimental dental bleaching. The proposed protocol guarantees statistically significant results in 96 hours , confirming the efficacy , cheapness , viability and practicality of the protocol developed in this study.
