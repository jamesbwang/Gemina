 This study aims at exploring staff perceptions of common and best practices toward a situation in which an older resident discloses their non-heterosexual sexual identity , differentiating between gay men , lesbians , and bisexuals. A total of 2,254 staff members from 96 Spanish long-term care facilities took part in the study. They were asked about what they think most of their workmates would do and what they think should be done in a situation in which an older resident discloses his/her non-heterosexual sexual orientation. The results indicate that , in general , staff 's attitudes to non-heterosexual older residents ' disclosure of their sexual identity are quite tolerant and open. However , differences in staff perceptions of common and best practices indicate that there is still potential for improvement. Results underline that factors such as residents ' sexual identity ( and particularly , bisexuality) , generation , professional position , and the prevailing model of care influence staff responses.
