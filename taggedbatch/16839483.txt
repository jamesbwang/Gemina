 As the number of surgeries increases and the elapsed time of the realization increases as well , the postoperative evaluations would become increasingly necessary. To assess the psychological profile before and after surgery. Were evaluated 281 patients from the public service of bariatric surgery. In this study , 109 patients completed the evaluations before surgery ( T0) and up to 23 months after surgery ( T1); 128 completed the evaluations in T0 and between 24 months and 59 months after surgery ( T2); and 44 completed the evaluations in T0 and 60 months after surgery ( T3). A semi-structured interview , the Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory ( BDI) , Beck Anxiety ( BAI) , and the Binge Eating Scale ( BES) were used. There was a higher prevalence of female ( 83 %) , patients with less than 12 years of education ( 83 %) , and patients who have a partner ( 64 %). Analyzing all times of evaluation , regarding anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> , and binge eating , there was a reduction in all symptoms in T1 , pointing to significant improvements in the first 23 months after surgery. Already , in T2 and T3 , there was an increase in all indicators of anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> , and binge eating pointing to the transient impact of weight<symptom> loss<symptom> or bariatric surgery on these symptoms. This study shows the importance of the continuous psychological evaluation and needs for the appropriate interventions for these patients who have undergone bariatric surgery , even after weight<symptom> loss<symptom>.
