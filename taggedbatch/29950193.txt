 SummaryThe effects of adding fulvic acids ( FAs) to semen extenders on the quality parameters of frozen-thawed goat buck spermatozoa remain undetermined. Buck semen samples collected from six mature goat bucks once a week were diluted with Tris-egg yolk-based extenders. The diluted semen samples were supplemented with FAs ( 0.2 , 0.4 and 0.6 % , w/w) , cryopreserved , and evaluated for sperm-quality parameters. Addition of FAs to the extender increased progressive<symptom> motility<symptom> , acrosome integrity , membrane integrity , and superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and decreased percentage abnormality and sperm malondialdehyde level compared with the control group. However , excessive FA addition ( > 0.4 % , w/w) to semen extenders did not improve the efficiency. The results indicated that FAs could be a promising cryoprotectant for goat buck sperm.
