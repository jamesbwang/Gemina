 In this study , survival and cause of death were investigated in patients with Crohn 's disease ( CD) at a tertiary referral center. A database was created based on the medical records of 1108 CD patients who had a history of visiting our hospital to investigate background characteristics , cumulative survival rates from diagnosis , causes of death , and the standardized mortality ratio ( SMR) for each cause of death. A follow-up questionnaire survey of patients followed up inadequately was also conducted. The cumulative survival rate from diagnosis was determined using the life table method and compared with that of a sex- and age-matched population model from the year 2000. The study included 1108 patients whose mean age at diagnosis was 25.6 ± 10.8 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 14.6 ± 9.4 years , and there were 52 deaths. The cumulative survival rate was significantly lower 25 years after the diagnosis of CD ( 91.7 %) than in the standard population model ( 95.7 %). SMRs for both all causes ( 3.5; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 2.7-4.6) and CD-specific causes ( 36.7; 95 % CI 26.1-51.6) were high. Among the CD-specific causes , SMRs were especially high for small intestine and colorectal cancers , gastrointestinal diseases including intestinal<symptom> failure<symptom> ( IF) , perioperative complications , and amyloidosis. The SMRs for both all causes and CD-specific causes were high in CD patients. CD-specific causes including intestinal cancer , IF , perioperative complications , and amyloidosis showed especially high SMRs.
