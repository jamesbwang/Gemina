 Little is known on the impact of emerging treatments for advanced melanoma ( stages III and IV) on patients ' functioning and well-being. The objective of this study was to describe the patient-reported treatment-related symptom ( TRS) burden in advanced melanoma. Twenty-nine in-depth , qualitative interviews were conducted among adult patients with advanced melanoma in Canada using a semi-structured interview method. Interviews were transcribed verbatim , and key concepts were identified using a grounded theory analytic approach. The 29 patients reported 13 unique treatment journeys involving the following drug therapy categories: cytotoxic chemotherapies , CTLA-4 inhibitors , BRAF or MEK inhibitors , and PD-1 inhibitors. Patients typically underwent multiple treatment episodes over time. Common TRSs included nausea<symptom> , fatigue<symptom> , diarrhea<disease><symptom> or constipation<symptom> , and skin<symptom> rashes<symptom>. Patients described these as impacting their physical functioning , ability to perform activities of daily living , social functioning , and overall quality of life. Our findings provide a description of the patient 's experience with treatment for advanced melanoma. Our sample included patients typically diagnosed in mid-life , facing an urgent sequence of medical procedures and a pharmacological treatment journey that was burdensome. There is a need for less toxic and more efficacious treatments earlier in the patient journey to alleviate the impact of advanced melanoma treatment on patients ' health-related quality of life.
