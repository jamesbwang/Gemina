 Estimation of the contractility of the left ventricle during exercise is an important part of the rehabilitation protocol. It is known that cardiac contractility increases with an increase in heart rate. This phenomenon is called the force-frequency relation ( FFR). Using wave intensity , we aimed to evaluate FFR noninvasively during graded exercise. We enrolled 83 healthy subjects. Using ultrasonic diagnostic equipment , we measured wave intensity ( WD) , which was defined in terms of blood velocity and arterial diameter , in the carotid artery and heart rate ( HR) before and during bicycle ergometer exercise. FFRs were constructed by plotting the maximum value of WD ( WD WD The FFR was obtained noninvasively by carotid arterial wave intensity ( WD
