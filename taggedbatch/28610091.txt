 Generating regional checklists for insects is frequently based on combining data sources ranging from literature and expert assertions that merely imply the existence of an occurrence to aggregated , standard-compliant data of uniquely identified specimens. The increasing diversity of data sources also means that checklist authors are faced with new responsibilities , effectively acting as filterers to select and utilize an expert-validated subset of all available data. Authors are also faced with the technical obstacle to bring more occurrences into Darwin Core-based data aggregation , even if the corresponding specimens belong to external institutions. We illustrate these issues based on a partial update of the Kimsey et al. 2017 checklist of darkling beetles- Tenebrionidae sec. Bousquet et al. 2018- inhabiting the Algodones Dunes of California. Our update entails 54 species-level concepts for this group and region , of which 31 concepts were found to be represented in three specimen-data aggregator portals , based on our interpretations of the aggregators ' data. We reassess the distributions and biogeographic affinities of these species , focusing on taxa that are precinctive ( highly geographically restricted) to the Lower Colorado River Valley in the context of recent dune formation from the Colorado River. Throughout , we apply taxonomic concept labels ( taxonomic name according to source) to contextualize preferred name usages , but also show that the identification data of aggregated occurrences are very rarely well-contextualized or annotated. Doing so is a pre-requisite for publishing open , dynamic checklist
