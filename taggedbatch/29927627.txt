 Evaluating the safety and outcomes of premaxillary setback with posterior vomerine ostectomy in single-stage repair of complete bilateral cleft lip ( CBCL) with severe premaxillary protrusion. Retrospective case series. Multiple outreach surgical<disease> sites. From 2012 to 2016 , 41 patients with CBCL and severe premaxillary protrusion underwent posterior vomerine premaxillary setback ( PVPS) by a single surgeon in Brazil , Ecuador , and Peru. Patients 4 months to 18 years old undergoing primary or revision CBCL surgery were eligible for inclusion in the study. Patients with diagnosed syndromes<disease><symptom> were excluded. Posterior vomerine premaxillary setback. Postoperative complications and postoperative aesthetic outcomes. The mean age at surgery was 3.7 ± 3.8 years , with an average follow-up time of 17.0 ± 13.9 months. Patients underwent their procedures in Brazil ( 71 %) , Ecuador ( 22 %) , and Peru ( 7 %). The majority of patients were aged 2 years or less ( 56 %) , were males ( 54 %) , had undergone prior surgery ( 56 %) , and had not undergone preoperative surgical orthopedics ( 95 %). None of the patients developed major complications. All patients were able to undergo PVPS with concomitant required procedures and had good aesthetic outcomes. Few reports have evaluated single-stage CBCL repair or revision with severe premaxillary protrusion using PVPS. Our study shows that this technique is safe and results in good aesthetic outcomes. Further follow-up with anthropometric patient data is needed to evaluate long-term postoperative outcomes.
