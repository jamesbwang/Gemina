 This study is aimed at determining if tibial nerve stimulation ( TNS) can modulate both bladder underactivity and overactivity. In α-chloralose anesthetized cats , tripolar cuff electrodes were implanted on both tibial nerves and TNS threshold ( T) for inducing toe twitching<symptom> was determined for each nerve. Normal bladder activity was elicited by slow intravesical infusion of saline; while bladder overactivity was induced by infusion of 0.25 % acetic acid to irritate the bladder. Bladder underactivity was induced during saline infusion by repeated application ( 2-6 times) of 30-min TNS ( 5 Hz , 4-8T , 0.2 msec) to the left tibial nerve , while TNS ( 1 Hz , 4T , 0.2 msec) was applied to the right tibial nerve to reverse the bladder underactivity. Prolonged 5-Hz TNS induced bladder underactivity by significantly increasing bladder capacity to 173.8 % ± 10.4 % of control and reducing the contraction amplitude to 40.1 % ± 15.3 % of control , while 1 Hz TNS normalized the contraction amplitude and significantly reduced the bladder capacity to 130 % -140 % of control. TNS at 1 Hz in normal bladders did not change contraction amplitude and only slightly changed the capacity , but in both normal and underactive bladders significantly increased contraction duration. The effects of 1 Hz TNS did not persist following stimulation. Under isovolumetric conditions when the bladder was underactive , TNS ( 0.5-3 Hz; 1-4T) induced large amplitude and sustained bladder contractions. In overactive bladders , TNS during cystometry inhibited bladder overactivity at 5 Hz but not at 1 Hz. This study indicates that TNS at different frequencies might be used to treat bladder underactivity and overactivity.
