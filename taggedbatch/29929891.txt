 The head is kinematically constrained to the torso through the spine and thus , the spine dictates the amount of output head angular motion expected from an input impact. Here , we investigate the spinal kinematic constraint by analyzing the head instantaneous center of rotation ( HICOR) with respect to the torso in head/neck sagittal extension and coronal lateral flexion during mild loads applied to 10 subjects. We found the mean HICOR location was near the C5-C6 intervertebral joint in sagittal extension , and T2-T3 intervertebral joint in coronal lateral flexion. Using the impulse-momentum relationship normalized by subject mass and neck length , we developed a non-dimensional analytical ratio between output angular velocity and input linear impulse as a function of HICOR location. The ratio was 0.65 and 0.50 in sagittal extension and coronal lateral flexion respectively , implying 30 % greater angular velocities in sagittal extension given an equivalent impulse. Scaling to subject physiology also predicts larger required impulses given greater subject mass and neck length to achieve equivalent angular velocities , which was observed experimentally. Furthermore , the HICOR has greater motion in sagittal extension than coronal lateral flexion , suggesting the head and spine can be represented with a single inverted pendulum in coronal lateral flexion , but requires a more complex representation in sagittal extension. The upper cervical spine has substantial compliance in sagittal extension , and may be responsible for the complex motion and greater extension angular velocities. In analyzing the HICOR , we can gain intuition regarding the neck 's role in dictating head motion during external loading.
