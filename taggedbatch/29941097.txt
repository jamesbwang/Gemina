 Both atopic dermatitis<disease> ( AD) and psoriasis are characterized by complex inflammatory circuits that may be regulated through `` feed-forward '' mechanisms in the epidermis that amplify cellular immune responses through production of keratinocyte-derived cytokines and inflammatory mediators. IL-17C is a unique cytokine that is produced by keratinocytes and that is involved in such synergistic loops that may be responsible for amplifying the inflammation<symptom> in both diseases. This may ultimately lead to induction of S100As and other molecules that accompany epidermal hyperplasia<disease>. Thus , antagonism of IL-17C may be beneficial in both psoriasis and AD patients. The IL-17C neutralizing antibody MOR 106 was able to inhibit both T helper type 2 cells and T helper type 17/T helper type 22-skewed inflammatory loops that drive different features of AD and psoriasis. The therapeutic potential of IL-17C antagonism in AD is supported by a recently reported small phase 1 clinical trial in patients with AD.
