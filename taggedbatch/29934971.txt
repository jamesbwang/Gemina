 Diploid organisms undergo meiosis to produce haploid germ cells. Crossover events during meiosis promote genetic diversity and facilitate accurate chromosome segregation. The baker 's yeast Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> is extensively used as a model for analysis of meiotic recombination. Conventional methods for measuring recombination events in S.<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> have been limited by the number and density of genetic markers. Next generation sequencing ( NGS)- based analysis of hybrid yeast genomes bearing thousands of heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) markers has revolutionized analysis of meiotic recombination. By facilitating analysis of marker segregation in the whole genome with unprecedented resolution , this method has resulted in the generation of high-resolution recombination maps in wild-type and meiotic mutants. These studies have provided novel insights into the mechanism of meiotic recombination. In this review , we discuss the methodology , challenges , insights and future prospects of using NGS-based methods for whole genome analysis of meiotic recombination. The objective is to facilitate the use of these high through-put sequencing methods for the analysis of meiotic recombination given their power to provide significant new insights into the process.
