 To achieve control over naturally diffusive , out-of-equilibrium systems composed of self-propelled particles , such as cells or self-phoretic colloids , is a long-standing challenge in active matter physics. The inherently random motion of these active particles can be rectified in the presence of local and periodic asymmetric cues given that a nontrivial interaction exists between the self-propelled particle and the cues. Here , we exploit the phoretic and hydrodynamic interactions of synthetic micromotors with local topographical features to break the time-reversal symmetry of particle trajectories and to direct a macroscopic flow of micromotors. We show that the orientational alignment induced on the micromotors by the topographical features , together with their geometrical asymmetry , is crucial in generating directional particle flow. We also show that our system can be used to concentrate micromotors in confined spaces and identify the interactions leading to this effect. Finally , we develop a minimal model , which identifies the key parameters of the system responsible for the observed rectification. Overall , our system allows for robust control over both temporal and spatial distribution of synthetic micromotors.
