 Religiosity and spirituality are influential experiences that buffer adverse effects of stressors. Spirituality typically declines during adolescence , although not universally. Using Latent Class Growth Analysis , we examined changes in spiritual connectedness among 188 early ( 52 % female; M age = 10.77 , SD = 0.65 years) and 167 middle ( 56 % female; M age = 13.68 , SD = 0.82 years) predominantly African American adolescents participating in a 4-year longitudinal study. Three distinct profiles of spiritual connectedness emerged: low and steady , moderate with declines over the study period , and high and steady. Profile distributions varied across developmental level: there were more early adolescents in the high and steady profile and more middle adolescents in the decliner profile. Youth in the high and steady profile evidenced more goal-directedness and life satisfaction and more effective emotion management and coping strategies than youth in other profiles. Contributions to the positive development literature are discussed.
