 Many studies have indicated a relationship between diabetes and Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). However , the molecular mechanism underlying this association has not been clarified. Among several factors , insulin degrading enzyme ( IDE) , which plays roles in the degradation of both insulin and amyloid β ( Aβ) , has gained interest as a potential target in efforts to solve this puzzle. This study sought to examine the effects of varying insulin and/or glucose concentrations on IDE expression. Experiments were performed on primary cultured rat neurons and cortices of rats with streptozotocin ( STZ)- induced diabetes. IDE protein and mRNA expression levels were measured by western blot and RT-PCR , respectively. In primary cultured cortical neurons , removal of insulin for 5 days reduced the expression of IDE. A five-day treatment with a high concentration of glucose in insulin-free media reduced IDE levels , while a high concentration of glucose in the presence of insulin had no effect. In groups treated with glucose or insulin intermittently , the reduction in IDE levels was observed only in neurons exposed to high glucose together with no insulin for 5 days. Shorter incubation periods ( 48 h) , either continuously or intermittently , did not affect IDE levels. IDE expression in the cortex of rats with STZ-induced diabetes was found to be decreased. Our data suggest that insulin deprivation , rather than high glucose , is a significant determinant of IDE regulation. As evidence indicates potential roles for IDE in diabetes and AD , understanding the mechanisms regulating IDE expression may be important in developing new treatment strategies.
