 Recently a number of novel adenoviruses have been isolated from diverse bat species and from diverse geographical locations. We describe the isolation of a novel adenovirus<pathogen> ( Family Adenoviridae , genus Mastadenovirus<pathogen>) from a pool of liver and spleen tissue of an apparently healthy wild-caught Egyptian fruit bat ( Rousettus aegyptiacus) in South Africa. Genetically the virus is most closely related to four mastadenoviruses recently isolated in China , from Miniopterus schreibersi and Rousettus leschenaultii bats , which are highly divergent from previously identified bat adenoviruses. The length of the Rousettus aegyptiacus adenovirus-3085 ( RaegAdV-3085) genome , at 29,342 bp is similar to its closest relatives , and contains 27 open reading frames. The RaegAdV-3085 genome has a low G + C content ( 36.4 %) relative to other viruses in the genus ( between 43.6 and 63.9 %) but similar to its closest relatives. The inverted terminal repeat ( ITR) of RaegAdV-3085 is only 40 bp compared to between 61 and 178 bp of its closest relatives. The discovery of RaegAdV-3085 expands the diversity of known adenoviruses in bats and might represent a member of a new mastadenovirus<pathogen> species in bats.
