 Sclerotinia sclerotiorum<pathogen> is responsible for the white mold of soybeans , and the difficulty to control the disease in Brazil is causing million-dollar damages. Stachybotrys levispora has shown activity against S. sclerotiorum<pathogen>. In our present investigation , we analyzed the chemical basis of this inhibition. Eight compounds were isolated , and using spectroscopic methods , we identified their structures as the known substances 7-dechlorogriseofulvin , 7-dechlorodehydrogriseofulvin , griseofulvin , dehydrogriseofulvin , 3,13-dihydroxy-5,9,11-trimethoxy-1-methylbenzophenone , griseophenone A , 13-hydroxy-3,5,9,11-tetramethoxy-1-methylbenzophenone , and 12-chloro-13-hydroxy-3,5,9,11-tetramethoxy-1-methylbenzophenone. Griseofulvin inhibited the mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum<pathogen> at 2 Î¼g mL
