The aim of this study is to report the presentation and management of cardiac Hydatid diseases admitted to two major cardiac centers. A retrospective , case series study , conducted in two centers during two years. Each case presented separately regarding presentation , diagnosis and management. Four cases have been reported , age ranged from 14 to 42 years with mean age of 24.75 years. Three patients ( 75 %) were male , one patient ( 25 %) was female. Three cases ( 75 %) had history of chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , 2 cases ( 50 %) had palpitation , and one case ( 25 %) had nausea<symptom> , vomiting and fever<symptom>. Echocardiography was the initial diagnostic test in 2 cases ( 50 %) , final diagnostic test in two cases ( 50 %). In 3 cases ( 75 %) the cyst<symptom> was found in the left ventricle and one case ( 25 %) in right ventricle. Median sternotomy was performed for all cases. Cardiac Hydatid cyst<symptom> is a very rare disease. Chest<symptom> pain<symptom> is the most common symptom. Surgery is the main modality of treatment.
