 Health systems globally are exploring new models of care to address the increasing demand for palliative , hospice , and end-of-life care. Yet few tools exist at the population level to explore `` what if '' scenarios and test , in a `` cost avoidance environment , '' the impact of these new care models on policy , workforce , technology , and funding. This article introduces the application of scenario-based `` what if '' thinking and discrete event simulation in strategic planning for a not-for-profit hospice organization. It will describe how a set of conceptual models was designed to frame discussions between strategic partners about the implications and alternatives in implementing a new , integrated service model for palliative and end-of-life care.
