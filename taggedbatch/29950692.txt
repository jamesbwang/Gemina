 Comorbidity burden is a well-established risk factor for non-relapse mortality ( NRM) following allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( allo-SCT). We evaluated whether individual comorbidities could better characterize NRM risk. Furthermore , given differing toxicity profiles of conditioning agents , we hypothesized that the hazard of comorbidities is exerted in a regimen-specific manner. This retrospective study included 875 adults treated with an allo-SCT. Six conditioning regimens were considered. Across the entire cohort and within each regimen , the hazard ratio ( HR) for NRM associated with individual comorbidities was assessed using multivariable Cox regressions. In the overall population , renal dysfunction , hypoalbuminemia , and severe<symptom> hepatic disease were associated with the highest risk of NRM ( HR 2.1 , HR 1.9 , HR 1.7 , respectively). The risk associated with specific comorbidities was modified by the conditioning regimen and was not correlated with intensity. In patients conditioned with fludarabine/busulfan ( Flu/Bu4) , NRM risk was increased with cardiac disease ( HR 5.54). Severe<symptom> pulmonary disease and a pre-existing infection were associated with increased NRM risk in patients receiving fludarabine/melphalan ( HR 4.9) and fludarabine/treosulfan ( HR 3.6) , respectively. Comorbidities may exert effects unique to particular conditioning regimens , suggesting that regimen selection should be driven in part by specific comorbidities.
