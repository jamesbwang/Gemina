 Taiwanofungus camphoratus has been reported to have antitumor effects against various cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the direct inhibitory effect of By-1 ( 3-isobutyl-l-methoxy-4- ( 4 '- ( 3-methylbut-2-enyloxy) phenyl) -1 H-pyrrole-2,5-dione) , a compound from spent broth from submerged cultures of T. camphoratus , on human lung adenocarcinoma cells and to determine the molecular mechanism underlying this effect. The growth-inhibitory assay and colony formation assay showed that cell viability was significantly decreased. A By-1 concentration of 300 μmol/L caused 73.55 % cell death and at a concentration of 240 μmol/L led to a 58 % reduction in the number of colonies. The wound-healing assay showed that the distance of migration was 0.3 times shorter than that of untreated cells. Flow cytometry revealed that By-1 could suppress DNA synthesis , cause cell cycle arrest at the S phase , and induce apoptosis in a reactive oxygen species-dependent manner. Furthermore , the expression of caspase-3 and P53 was 4 times higher than that in untreated cells , and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was decreased 2 times compared with the protein in untreated cells. It is interesting to note that apoptosis and autophagy were both induced during treatment with By-1 , and autophagy inhibition decreased cell proliferation. By-1 potently inhibited the growth of SPCA-1 cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The combination of proapoptosis agents and antiautophagy agents could effectively enhance anticancer efficacy , which may be a new strategy in treating non-small cell lung cancer.
