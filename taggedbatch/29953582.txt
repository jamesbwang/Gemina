 Application of deep-learning technology to skin cancer classification can potentially improve skin cancer screening sensitivity and specificity , but the number of training images required for such system is thought to be extremely large. To determine if deep-learning technology could be used to develop an efficient skin cancer classifying system with a relatively small dataset of clinical images. A deep convolutional neural network ( DCNN) was trained using a dataset of 4867 clinical images obtained from 1842 patients diagnosed with skin tumors at the University of Tsukuba Hospital from 2003 to 2016. The images consisted of 14 diagnoses , including both malignant and benign conditions. Its performance was tested against 13 board-certified dermatologists and 9 dermatology trainees. Overall classification accuracy of the trained DCNN was 76.5 %. The DCNN achieved 96.3 % sensitivity ( correctly classified malignant as malignant) and 89.5 % specificity ( correctly classified benign as benign). Although the accuracy of malignant or benign classification by the board-certified dermatologists was statistically higher than that of the dermatology trainees ( 85.3 % ± 3.7 % and 74.4 % ± 6.8 % , P < .01) , the DCNN achieved greater accuracy , as high as 92.4 % ± 2.1 % ( P < .0001). We developed an efficient skin tumor classifier using a DCNN trained on a relatively small dataset. The DCNN could classify images of skin tumors more accurately than board-certified dermatologists. Collectively , the current system may have capabilities for screening purposes in general medical practice , particularly because it only requires a single clinical image for classification.
