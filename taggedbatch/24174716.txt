 The article reveals patterns of changes in the parameters of oxidative modification of proteins for different periods of the inflammatory process in periodontal tissues during periodontitis<disease>. Biochemical researches of phenylhydrazones , aldehyde- , and ketone derivatives of neutral and basic proteins were determined in the blood of white rats on the 7th , 14th , and 30th days of the experimental periodontitis<disease> development , as well as in intact animals. The method for determination of the oxidative modification of proteins was based on the interaction of oxidized amino acid residues with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to form 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones. At the early stage of experimental periodontitis<disease> development , i.e. , on the 7th day , an increase in the products of oxidative modification of proteins of basic and neutral nature was observed in the blood serum , but later , on the 14th day , this index changed in opposite direction , i.e. , it began to decrease; however , it was higher relative to the intact group of animals. The obtained factual data evidence that under the conditions of experimental periodontitis<disease> formation , there is an intensive increase in the level of oxidative modification of proteins especially in the early period of the inflammatory process development.
