 This study intended to screen differentially expressed genes and pathways in Brown Adipose Tissue ( BAT) of obese mice after the intervention of hypoxia by mRNA expression profile microarray , exploring the mechanism of hypoxia activated BAT. Thirty C57BL/6J male mice were divided into the normal diet control group ( N , After intervention , the body<symptom> weight and blood lipid and glucose levels in group H were significantly lower than those of group OB. Comparing with group N , 802 genes were significantly up-regulated and 1 175genes were down-regulated. The BP of these genes mainly concerned with glucose and lipid metabolic process and inflammatory reaction. Comparing with group OB , 297 genes were significantly up-regulated and 228 genes were down-regulated. These genes participated in glucose and lipid metabolic process , lipid transport , muscle system process and cardiovascular system development. The pathways of regulating BAT by hypoxia exposure mainly concentrated on the HIF-1 , PI3K-AKT , FoxO and ErbB signaling pathways. A series of genes and pathways in BAT could be adjusted by hypoxia exposure , so that hypoxia could improve the activity of BAT , promoting obese organism to lose weight.
