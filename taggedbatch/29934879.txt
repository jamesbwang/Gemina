 Lasiodiplodia<pathogen> theobromae<pathogen> is a known plant pathogen in tropical and subtropical areas. Few cases have been reported in humans ( usually keratitis<disease><symptom> and endophthalmitis<disease>) with only two cases of fungal sinusitis<disease> in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients published to date. We report a case of invasive sinusitis<disease> secondary to L.<pathogen> theobromae<pathogen> in an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipient successfully treated with surgical debridement and triazole antifungals with a review of available literature.
