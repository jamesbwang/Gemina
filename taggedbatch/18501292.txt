 The occurrence of clinical varicella during pregnancy is rare but it may pose maternal and fetal risks. Perinatal maternal varicella may result in potentially severe neonatal varicella , especially when maternal eruptions occur between 5 days before and 2 days after delivery. We report eight cases of newborns of mothers with varicella in the peri-partum period in order to synthesize the current state of knowledge on the risk of contracting virus as well as to develop treatment protocol. We conducted a descriptive study at the Maternity and Neonatology Center , Sousse , over a period of 10 years. Eight newborns were included in the study. Prenatal diagnosis was made in 7 mothers. Only a woman developed varicella 3 days after delivery. Five newborns were symptomatic on admission. All newborns had typical varicella skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> , three of them had respiratory distress associated. Treatment was based on newborn isolation , local skin care and Acyclovir therapy. Patients evolution was favorable. The occurrence of varicella infection during pregnancy remains possible in the countries where vaccination is still not accessible to all. The risk of maternal and fetal complications justifies specific and well codified treatment
