 What is the central question of this study? Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1) is an important obesity/diabetes target , with effects dependent on circulating GLP-1 concentrations. Peripheral tissues extract GLP-1; therefore , sampling venous versus arterialized blood might provide different GLP-1 concentrations. This study examined whether arterialization alters GLP-1 concentrations during fasting and feeding. What is the main finding and its importance? This study demonstrates that venous blood provides lower postprandial but not fasting GLP-1 concentrations versus arterialized blood. Therefore , when accurate assessment of postprandial peripheral availability of GLP-1 is required , blood sampling methods should be considered carefully , reported clearly , and arterialization is recommended. Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1) displays concentration-dependent effects on metabolism , appetite<symptom> and angiogenesis; therefore , accurate determination of circulating GLP-1 concentrations is important. In this study , we compared GLP-1 concentrations in venous versus arterialized blood in both fasted and fed conditions. Venous and arterialized blood samples were obtained simultaneously from 10 young , healthy men before and 30 , 60 and 120 min after ingestion of 75 g glucose. Plasma GLP-1 concentrations increased in response to glucose ingestion ( time effect , P < 0.01) and to a lesser extent in venous versus arterialized plasma ( time × arterialization interaction , P < 0.01). Accordingly , the plasma incremental area under the curve was lower in venous versus arterialized plasma ( 974 ± 88 versus 1214 ± 115 pmol l ( 120 min)
