 Develop a hydrophobic , degradation-resistant dental restorative based on an Oxirane-Acrylate IPN System ( OASys) with low shrinkage-stress to substantially extend clinical lifetime. Unfilled OASys blends were prepared using dipenta-erythritol-hexaacrylate ( DPHA) and p-cycloaliphatic-diepoxide ( EP5000). Varying proportions of camphorquinone/iodonium photoinitiator , with a co-reactant oligomeric-diol , served as the experimental curing system. The effects of oxirane-acrylate ratio on the degree-of-cure ( Durometer-D hardness) , hydrophobicity ( contact angle) , mechanical properties ( 3-point bending) , near-infrared FTIR degree-of-conversion ( DoC) , polymerization shrinkage , and shrinkage stress were determined. 70:30 BisGMA: TEGDMA resin served as control. Oxirane tended to decrease hardness and increase hydrophobicity. 0:100 , 25:75 , 50:50 EP5000: DPHA are harder after 24h than control. 75:25 and 100:0 EP5000: DPHA increased in hardness over 24h , but were softer than control. All groups increased in contact angle over 24h. After 24h , 50:50 , 75:25 and 0:100 EP5000: DPHA were more hydrophobic ( ∼ 75-84 °) than the control ( ∼ 65 °). Acrylate DoC was ∼ 60 % across all experimental groups. Initial oxirane conversion varied from ∼ 42 % in 100:0 EP5000: DPHA to ∼ 82 % 75:25 EP5000: DPHA. However , oxirane DoC increased for 100:0 EP5000: DPHA to ∼ 73 ° over 24h , demonstrating dark cure. Moduli and ultimate transverse strengths of OASys groups were higher than for 0:100 EP5000: DPHA , with 50:50 EP5000: DPHA having higher modulus than other experimental groups. However , the control had higher modulus and UTS than all experimental groups. Volumetric shrinkage averaged 7 % for experimental groups , but stress decreased dramatically with increasing oxirane content. Hydrophobic , low shrinkage-stress OASys resins are promising for development of composites that improve longevity and reduce the cost of dental care.
