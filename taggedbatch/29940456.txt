 Premorbid adjustment ( PA) in academic and social domain is a key-predictor of cognitive performance in schizophrenia. Prior studies provided inconsistent findings regarding the differential relationships of PA domains with post-illness cognition. Multivariate associations of academic and social PA in each developmental stage ( childhood , early and late adolescence) with post-onset cognitive variables were explored. Furthermore , possible differential relationships of PA domain deterioration courses with post-onset cognitive dysfunction were investigated. Seventy-five schizophrenia patients were evaluated with Premorbid Adjustment Scale ( PAS). General cognitive ability , verbal IQ , verbal memory and learning , processing speed , working memory , executive function and premorbid IQ were assessed. Canonical Correlation Analyses revealed that poorer academic PA across childhood and early adolescence was related to worse post-onset verbal IQ , working memory , verbal learning and executive function , while academic PA deterioration between early and late adolescence was associated with poorer verbal learning and executive function and , as further analysis indicated , predicts IQ decline. Academic PA was exclusively associated with post-onset cognitive impairment. New evidence emerged for the specificity of each developmental period in constructing academic PA in its relation to post-illness cognition. Early premorbid academic maladjustment possibly constitutes the onset of a cognitive dysmaturational process which results to post-diagnosis impaired cognition.
