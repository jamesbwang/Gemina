 Cardiologists are seeing an increasing number of oncology patients every day , and acute coronary syndrome<disease><symptom> ( ACS) is one of the problems patients encounter during follow-up. Cardio-oncology is the care of patients with cancer and cardiovascular disease , whether overt or occult , already established or acquired during treatment. Cardiovascular complications can occur acutely during or shortly after treatment and persist as long-term effects for months to years after treatment. As a delayed effect of cancer treatment , cardiovascular damage can occur months to years after the initial treatment. Vasospasm , thrombosis , and radiation-induced cardiovascular diseases can all cause ACS. Careful surveillance of ACS symptoms and regular screening during follow-up of patients with malignancy are suggested. In this review , we summarize the ACS we usually encounter during a range of cancer treatments or post cancer survival by providing illustrative case examples.
