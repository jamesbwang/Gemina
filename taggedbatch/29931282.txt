 PASTA is a multiple sequence method that uses divide-and-conquer plus iteration to enable base alignment methods to scale with high accuracy to large sequence datasets. By default , PASTA included MAFFT L-INS-i; our new extension of PASTA enables the use of MAFFT G-INS-i , MAFFT Homologs , CONTRAlign , and ProbCons. We analyzed the performance of each base method and PASTA using these base methods on 224 datasets from BAliBASE 4 with at least 50 sequences. We show that PASTA enables the most accurate base methods to scale to larger datasets at reduced computational effort , and generally improves alignment and tree accuracy on the largest BAliBASE datasets. PASTA is available at https://github.com/kodicollins/pasta and has also been integrated into the original PASTA repository at https://github.com/smirarab/pasta. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
