 Bioactive natural products are important starting points for developing chemical tools for biological research. For elucidating their bioactivity profile , biological systems with concise complexity such as cell culture systems are frequently used , whereas unbiased investigations in more complex multicellular systems are only rarely explored. Here , we demonstrate with the natural product Rotihibin A and the plant research model system Arabidopsis thaliana that unbiased transcriptional profiling enables a rapid , label-free , and compound economic evaluation of a natural product 's bioactivity profile in a complex multicellular organism. To this end , we established a chemical synthesis of Rotihibin A as well as that of structural analogues , followed by transcriptional profiling-guided identification and validation of Rotihibin A as a TOR<pathogen> signaling inhibitor ( TOR<pathogen> = target of rapamycin). These findings illustrate that a combined approach of transcriptional profiling and natural product research may represent a technically simple approach to streamline the development of chemical tools from natural products even for biologically complex multicellular biological systems.
