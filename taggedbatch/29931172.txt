 The purpose of this study was to examine long-term life expectancy including cerebrovascular events ( CVE) and fate of the leg in patients with peripheral arterial disease ( PAD) with or without cerebral infarction ( CI) detected by CT.. A prospective cohort study was performed in 932 patients with PAD. The endpoints were overall survival ( OS); CVE; stroke-free survival ( SFS); freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE); and freedom from major adverse cardiovascular and limb events ( MACLE). The prevalence of CI on CT was 56.8 %. There were 413 deaths ( 44.3 %) during follow-up. The rate of cardiovascular deaths among those who died was 53.5 %. The 3- , 5- , and 10-year OS rates were 82.0 % , 76.9 % , and 46.2 % , respectively. In Cox multivariate analyses , age , ankle brachial pressure index ( ABI) , critical limb ischemia ( CLI) , estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) , albumin level , and CI were independent factors associated with OS ( p < 0.05); age , ABI , CLI , atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) , and CI were related to CVE ( p < 0.05); age , ABI , CLI , diabetes , coronary heart disease ( CHD) , AF , eGFR , lower albumin , and CI were related to SFS ( p < 0.05); age , ABI , CLI , diabetes , CHD , eGFR , lower albumin , and CI were associated with MACE ( p < 0.05); and age , ABI , diabetes , CHD , eGFR , lower albumin and CI were related to MACLE ( p < 0.05). Statins improved MACE and MACLE ( p < 0.05) , and AF increased MACLE ( p < 0.05). CI on CT was an independent predictor for mortality , CVE , SFS , MACE , and MACLE. Statins improved MACE and MACLE , but AF increased CVE and MACLE in patients with PAD.
