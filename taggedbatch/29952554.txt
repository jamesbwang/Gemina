 Laboratory and field measurements have demonstrated that isoprene epoxydiol ( IEPOX) is the base component of a wide range of chemical species found in isoprene-derived secondary organic aerosol ( SOA). To address newly raised questions concerning the chemical identities of IEPOX-derived SOA , the results of laboratory experiments carried out in bulk aqueous and organic media and analyzed via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and computed free energies of possible products are reported. The IEPOX nucleophilic addition product 2-methyltetrol was found to react too slowly in aqueous solution to explain the previous observation of tetrahydrofuran-based species. The IEPOX isomerization reactions in organic media were shown to mainly produce 3-methyltetrahydrofuran-2,4-diols , which were also established by the computational results as one of the most thermodynamically favorable possible IEPOX reaction products. However , these isomerization reactions were found to be relatively slow as compared to nucleophilic addition reactions , indicating that their occurrence on ambient SOA might be limited to low water content situations. No evidence was found for the production of the C
