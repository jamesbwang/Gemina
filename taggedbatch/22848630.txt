 Almost all of the extracellular matrix ( ECM) components can be degraded by the endoproteinases matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs). Important regulators of MMPs , and thereby of the extracellular environment , are tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases ( TIMPs) , and especially TIMP-1. Early tumor development , as well as distant metastasis , may be results of an MMP/TIMP ratio imbalance altering the ECM. MMPs are elevated in several inflammatory conditions. Our aim is to investigate the prognostic role of MMP-8 ,- 9 , and TIMP-1 in colorectal cancer ( CRC) and their relationship to inflammation<symptom>. We included 337 colorectal cancer patients and 47 controls undergoing surgery at Helsinki University Hospital in Finland , 1998-2011. Serum levels of MMP-8 and plasma levels of C-reactive protein ( CRP) were determined with a time-resolved immunofluorometric assay ( IFMA) , and MMP-9 and TIMP-1 with commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) kits. Association and correlation analyses were performed with the Mann-Whitney U , Kruskal-Wallis , and Spearman rank correlation tests. Survival curves were constructed according to the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Among patients with advanced disease , serum levels of MMP-8 and TIMP-1 were elevated. CRC patients with high MMP-8 ( HR ( hazard ratio) 1.72 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.17-2.52 , P = 0.005) and those with high TIMP-1 ( HR 1.80 , 95 % CI 1.23-2.64 , P = 0.002) had worse prognoses. MMP-9 level failed to serve as a prognostic factor. In multivariable survival analysis , Dukes stage , and low MMP-9/ TIMP-1 molar ratio ( HR 0.46 , 95 % CI 0.33-0.98 , P = 0.042) were independently predicted prognosis. A weak correlation between CRP and MMP-8 ( r MMP-8 and TIMP-1 in serum , but not MMP-9 , identified CRC patients with bad prognosis. Among patients showing no systemic inflammatory response , MMP-8 and TIMP-1 may associate with poor prognosis.
