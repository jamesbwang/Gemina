 Methamphetamine is a popular psychostimulant worldwide which causes neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation. Although previous studies have characterized potential associations between addictive drugs and fasting blood glucose , the influence of methamphetamine on the blood glucose is still largely unknown. The present study was designed to investigate the change of fasting blood glucose of methamphetamine abusers and to confirm the impairment of liver and kidney. Fasting blood glucose was significantly decreased in methamphetamine abusers and in a high-fat diet mouse model with methamphetamine treatment discontinuation. Serum level of ALT , creatine kinase and creatinine were increased in methamphetamine abusers. Serum level of ALT and AST were increased in a high-fat diet mouse model after methamphetamine injection , but there was no significant difference in the anatomy of the liver and kidney in high-fat diet treated mice with or without methamphetamine. The levels of ALT and creatinine were also increased in the methamphetamine abusers. This study demonstrated that the level of glucose was decreased in methamphetamine abusers and in high-fat diet-fed mice after methamphetamine treatment discontinuation. The effect of methamphetamine on the levels of blood glucose may provide the evidence that methamphetamine abusers should be keep energy balance<symptom> due to the low<symptom> blood glucose.
