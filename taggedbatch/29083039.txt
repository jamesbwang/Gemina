 The calorific value ( CAL , KJ g-1) of different plant organs are important plant traits. Variation in CAL among different plant organs reflects the energy utilization and distribution strategy of plant. Here , we explored how the CAL of different plant organs varies at the species and regional level in relation to vegetation type ( 3697 forests samples , 430 grasslands samples , and 146 deserts samples). The results showed that , in the forests and grasslands , CAL significantly differed among the different organs and functional types of plants. The CAL of different organs in forests was ordered as: leaf ( 19.71 ± 1.82 KJ g-1) > branch ( 19.33 ± 1.32 KJ g-1) > trunk ( 19.09 ± 1.44 KJ g-1) > root ( 19.02 ± 1.11 KJ g-1). For forests , the CAL of plant organs , except for the leaves of trees and shrubs , increased with increasing latitude ( P < 0.01). In comparison , the CAL in the roots of shrubs and herbs decreased with increasing longitude ( P < 0.01). Through delineating systematic references of CAL among different plant organs , our findings provide key parameters to improve estimates of biomass energy at regional and global scales.
