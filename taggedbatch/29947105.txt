 Stretchable conductors and sensors have attracted great attention for use in electronic skin and healthcare monitoring. Despite the development of many stretchable conductors , there are still very few studies that utilize the conventional methods making electrodes and circuits used in current industry. A method is proposed to fabricate a stretchable electrode pattern and a stretchable tactile sensor by simply depositing linear metal lines through a mask on a stretchable substrate. A method is developed of a self-generating microfibril network on the surface of stretchable block copolymer substrates. The formation mechanism of the microfibril network is studied with finite element method simulations. Metals ( Au and Ag nanowires) are deposited directly on the substrate through a patterned mask. This study shows that strain-insensitive circuit and strain-sensitive sensor can be fabricated in a controlled way by adjusting the thickness of the deposited metal , which makes it easy to fabricate a tactile sensor by metal deposition. Also , by using the characteristic that the sensor has different sensitivity depending on the line pattern width , a novel sensor structure simultaneously providing analog-type position information and pressure value is proposed.
