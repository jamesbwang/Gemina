 Before 2014 , low-income individuals in the United States with non-dialysis-dependent CKD had fewer options to attain health insurance , limiting their opportunities to be preemptively wait-listed for kidney transplantation. We examined whether expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act was associated with differences in the number of individuals who were pre-emptively wait-listed with Medicaid coverage. Using the United Network of Organ Sharing database , we performed a retrospective observational study of adults ( age â‰¥ 18 years) listed for kidney transplantation before dialysis dependence between January 1 , 2011-December 31 , 2013 ( pre-Medicaid expansion) and January 1 , 2014-December 31 , 2016 ( post-Medicaid expansion). In multinomial logistic regression models , we compared trends in insurance types used for pre-emptive wait-listing in states that did and did not expand Medicaid with a difference-in-differences approach. States that fully implemented Medicaid expansion on January 1 , 2014 ( `` expansion states , '' Medicaid expansion was associated with an increase in the proportion of new pre-emptive listings for kidney transplantation with Medicaid coverage , with larger increases in Medicaid coverage among racial and ethnic minority listings than among white listings.
