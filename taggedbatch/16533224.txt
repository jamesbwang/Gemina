 Prurigo nodularis is a condition of unknown origin defined by papulonodular eruption and intense pruritus. Hodgkin lymphoma often presents nonspecific initial symptoms. An association between systemic malignancy and cutaneous manifestations has long been documented. We report a case of prurigo nodularis as a first presentation of Hodgkin lymphoma. A 35-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of pruritus. Previously diagnosed with bedbugs , the pruritus persisted even after insect eradication , with the appearance of papulonodular lesions<symptom> consistent with chronic prurigo. The pruritus and the pain were refractory to all treatments. She had no past medical history or clinical , radiological , or laboratory findings. A lymphadenopathy<disease><symptom> was revealed 2 years after onset of the symptoms. Lymph node biopsy showed a nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma. The patient was initiated on chemotherapy and the skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> decreased. This case report of chronic prurigo as the first manifestation of a systemic malignancy reminds us of the importance of a systematic diagnostic approach to this kind of patients initially and throughout time , especially if the symptoms do not respond to treatment. Our case may question the role of imaging examinations in the management and follow-up of a persistent prurigo nodularis.
