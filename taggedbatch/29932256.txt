 Metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs) which are inorganic-organic hybrid porous materials , prepared from metal ion/clusters and multidentate organic ligands have evolved to be next-generation utility materials because of their usability in diverse applications. These porous materials with excellent chemical stability and wide variety of functional groups , have demonstrated a new tool to the area of capturing various types of hazardous metal ion pollutants. This conceptual review focused on recent progress in reported MOFs as Hg ( II) and Pb ( II) adsorbent emphasizing the general concepts that have guided important developments in these area and their implications for future research. Also , we suggest our personal insights into future research opportunities in the area and we hope to encourage more researchers to engage in this new field of MOF-based materials with the goal of environmental pollution management.
