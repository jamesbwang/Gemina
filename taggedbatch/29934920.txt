 Convolutional neural network ( CNN) , a class of artificial neural networks that has become dominant in various computer vision tasks , is attracting interest across a variety of domains , including radiology. CNN is designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features through backpropagation by using multiple building blocks , such as convolution layers , pooling layers , and fully connected layers. This review article offers a perspective on the basic concepts of CNN and its application to various radiological tasks , and discusses its challenges and future directions in the field of radiology. Two challenges in applying CNN to radiological tasks , small dataset and overfitting , will also be covered in this article , as well as techniques to minimize them. Being familiar with the concepts and advantages , as well as limitations , of CNN is essential to leverage its potential in diagnostic radiology , with the goal of augmenting the performance of radiologists and improving patient care. • Convolutional neural network is a class of deep learning methods which has become dominant in various computer vision tasks and is attracting interest across a variety of domains , including radiology. • Convolutional neural network is composed of multiple building blocks , such as convolution layers , pooling layers , and fully connected layers , and is designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features through a backpropagation algorithm. • Familiarity with the concepts and advantages , as well as limitations , of convolutional neural network is essential to leverage its potential to improve radiologist performance and , eventually , patient care.
