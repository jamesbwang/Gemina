 This study examined the effect of environmental temperature deception on the rating of perceived exertion ( RPE) during 30 min of fixed-intensity cycling in the heat. Eleven trained male cyclists completed an incremental cycling test and four experimental trials. Trials consisted of 30 min cycling at 50 % P RPE was higher in the heat compared to CON , but not statistically different between the hot conditions ( mean ( 95 % credible interval); DEC Participants were under the impression they were cycling in different environments; however , this did not influence RPE. These data suggest that for trained cyclists , an awareness of environmental temperature does not contribute to the generation of RPE when exercising at a fixed intensity in the heat.
