 The membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenase ( mGDH) is a rate-limiting enzyme for the industrial production of 2-keto-d-gluconic acid ( 2KGA) from glucose. In this study , mGDH was firstly purified from a 2KGA industrial producing strain Pseudomonas<pathogen> plecoglossicida JUIM01. The purified mGDH exhibited a specific activity of 16.85 U/mg and was identified as monomeric membrane-bound PQQ-dependent dehydrogenase with a molecular mass of ~ 87 kDa. The K
