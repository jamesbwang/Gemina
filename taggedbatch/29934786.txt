 Thiothrix nivea is a filamentous sulfur-oxidizing bacterium<pathogen> common in activated sludge and its filament is covered with a polysaccharide layer called sheath. In this study , we found that T. nivea aggregates under acidic conditions. A hexagonal lattice pattern , a typical morphological feature of proteinaceous S-layers , was newly observed on the surface of the sheath by transmission electron microscopy. The pattern and the acid-dependent aggregation were not observed in T. fructosivorans , a relative sheath-forming bacterium<pathogen> of T. nivea. The putative S-layer of T. nivea was detached by washing with unbuffered tris ( hydroxymethyl) aminomethane base ( Tris) solution and a protein of 160 kDa was detected by electrophoresis. Based on partial amino acid sequences of the protein , its structural gene was identified. The gene encodes an acidic protein which has a putative secretion signal and a Ca
