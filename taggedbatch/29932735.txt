 Current models of genomic information provision will be unable to handle large-scale clinical integration of genomic information , as may occur in primary care settings. Therefore , adoption of digital tools for genetic and genomic information provision is anticipated , primarily using Internet-based , distributed approaches. The emerging consumer communication platform of virtual reality ( VR) is another potential intermediate approach between face-to-face and distributed Internet platforms to engage in genomics education and information provision. This exploratory study assessed whether provision of genomics information about body<symptom> weight in a simulated , VR-based consultation ( relative to a distributed , Internet platform) would be associated with differences in health behavior-related attitudes and beliefs , and interpersonal reactions to the avatar-physician. We also assessed whether outcomes differed depending upon whether genomic versus lifestyle-oriented information was conveyed. There were significant differences between communication platforms for all health behavior-oriented outcomes. Following communication in the VR setting , participants reported greater self-efficacy , dietary behavioral intentions , and exercise behavioral intentions than in the Internet-based setting. There were no differences in trust of the physician by setting , and no interaction between setting effects and the content of the information. This study was a first attempt to examine the potential capabilities of a VR-based communication setting for conveying genomic content in the context of weight management. There may be benefits to use of VR settings for communication about genomics , as well as more traditional health information , when it comes to influencing the attitudes and beliefs that underlie healthy lifestyle behaviors.
