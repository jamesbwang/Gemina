 Political orientation ( Republican/Democrat and conservative/liberal) and political environment ( geo-spatial political party affiliated voting patterns) are both associated with various health outcomes , including mortality. Modern disease etiology in the U.S. suggests that many of our health outcomes derive from behaviors and lifestyle choices. Thus , we examine the associations of political orientation and political environment with health behaviors. We used the Annenberg National Health Communication Survey ( ANHCS) data , which is a nationally representative U.S. survey fielded continuously from 2005 through 2012. The health behaviors studied include health information search , flu vaccination , excessive alcohol consumption , tobacco consumption , exercise , and dietary patterns. Democrats/liberals had higher odds of cigarette smoking and excessive drinking compared to Republicans/conservatives. Whereas , Republicans/conservatives ate fewer servings and fewer varieties of fruit and vegetables; ate more high fat and processed foods; and engaged in less in-depth health information searches compared to Democrats/liberals. Also , conservatives had lower odds of exercise participation than liberals; whereas Republicans had lower odds of flu vaccination. Greater Republican vote share in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections at the state and/or county levels was associated with higher odds of flu vaccination and smoking cigarettes and lower odds of avoiding fat/calories , avoiding fast/processed food , eating a variety of fruits and vegetables , and eating more servings of fruit. We use the distinct cognitive-motivational styles attributed to political orientation in discussing the findings. Health communication strategies could leverage these relationships to produce tailored and targeted messages as well as to develop and advocate for policy.
