 Language production and cognitive control are complex processes that involve distinct yet interacting brain networks. However , the extent to which these processes interact and their neural bases have not been thoroughly examined. Here , we investigated the neural and behavioral bases of language production and cognitive control via a phonological go/no-go picture-naming task. Naming difficulty and cognitive control demands ( i.e. , conflict monitoring and response inhibition) were manipulated by varying the proportion of naming trials ( go trials) and inhibition trials ( no-go trials) across task runs. The results demonstrated that as task demands increased , participants ' behavioral performance declined ( i.e. , longer reaction times on naming trials , more commission errors on inhibition trials) whereas brain activation generally increased. Increased activation was found not only within the language network but also in domain-general control regions. Additionally , right superior and inferior frontal and left supramarginal gyri were sensitive to increased task difficulty during both language production and response inhibition. We also found both positive and negative brain-behavior correlations. Most notably , increased activation in sensorimotor regions , such as precentral and postcentral gyri , was associated with better behavioral performance , in both successful picture naming and successful inhibition. Moreover , comparing the strength of correlations across conditions indicated that the brain-behavior correlations in sensorimotor regions that were associated with improved performance became stronger as task demands increased. Overall , our results suggest that cognitive control demands affect language production , and that successfully coping with increases in task difficulty relies on both language-specific and domain-general cognitive control regions.
