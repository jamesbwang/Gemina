 Feasibility study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Adjustable Transobturator Male System ( ATOMS) after failed surgical devices for male stress urinary incontinence ( SUI). Thirty patients were implanted with ATOMS after they were implanted with surgical device/s previously. SUI severity was evaluated as dryness ( 0-1 pad/day) , mild ( 2 pads/day) , moderate ( 3-5 pads/day) , or severe ( â‰¥ 6 pads/day). Change in pad-test and pad-count after adjustment , operative parameters , patient satisfaction , and number and grade of complications were investigated. Previous failed treatment methods were artificial urinary sphincter ( AUS; n = 19) , Advance ( n = 10) , and Virtue ( n = 1). Six cases had multiple previous treatments. Preoperative SUI was mild 6 ( 20 %) , moderate 11 ( 36.7 %) , and severe 13 ( 43.3 %). Median pad-test decreased from 435 mL baseline to 10 mL after adjustment and pad-count from 4 to 0. Dry-rate was 76.7 and 83.3 % declared satisfied. Postoperative SUI distribution was mild in 3 ( 10 %) and moderate in 4 ( 13.3 %). No patient had urinary<symptom> retention<symptom> after catheter removal. Complications presented in 4 ( 13.3 %; 3 grade-I , 1 grade-II). After a median of 24 months follow-up , no system experienced infection or urethral erosion and 1 ( 3.3 %) was removed for inefficacy. Based on short-term efficacy and patient satisfaction , ATOMS can be a realistic alternative for male SUI after other failed systems , including AUS. The absence of urethral erosion and limited infective problems makes this alternative attractive for cases with previous failed treatments.
