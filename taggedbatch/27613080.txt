 WRKY proteins comprise a large family of transcription factors that play important roles in many aspects of physiological processes and adaption to environment. However , little information was available about the WRKY genes in pineapple ( Ananas comosus) , an important tropical fruits. The recent release of the whole-genome sequence of pineapple allowed us to perform a genome-wide investigation into the organization and expression profiling of pineapple WRKY genes. In the present study , 54 pineapple WRKY ( AcWRKY) genes were identified and renamed on the basis of their respective chromosome distribution. According to their structural and phylogenetic features , the 54 AcWRKYs were further classified into three main groups with several subgroups. The segmental duplication events played a major role in the expansion of pineapple WRKY gene family. Synteny analysis and phylogenetic comparison of group III WRKY genes provided deep insight into the evolutionary characteristics of pineapple WRKY genes. Expression profiles derived from transcriptome data and real-time quantitative PCR analysis exhibited distinct expression patterns of AcWRKY genes in various tissues and in response to different abiotic stress and hormonal treatments. Fifty four WRKY genes were identified in pineapple and the structure of their encoded proteins , their evolutionary characteristics and expression patterns were examined in this study. This systematic analysis provided a foundation for further functional characterization of WRKY genes with an aim of pineapple crop improvement.
