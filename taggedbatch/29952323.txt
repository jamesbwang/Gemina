 Hazardous algal blooms can generate toxic compounds with significant health impacts for exposed communities. The ubiquitous class of algal toxins known as microcystins exhibits significant heterogeneity in its peptide structure , which has been minimally studied , given the significant impact this has on hydrophobicity , acid/base character and related environmental fate and health effects. Octanol-water partition coefficients for the microcystin congeners MCLR , MCRR , MCLY , MCLF , and MCLA were calculated over an environmentally and physiologically relevant pH range.
