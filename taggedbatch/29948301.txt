 In 1915 , when Delorme described three general requirements for successful nerve repair- ( 1) resecting scar until a healthy bed is secured , ( 2) excising damaged nerve until healthy stumps are reached , and ( 3) placing tension-free sutures , either by adequately mobilizing adjacent joints or nerve grafting-his work was heavily criticized. One century later , history has vindicated all but one of these claims. Flexing adjacent joints to avoid nerve grafts remains controversial , though this practice has increased in recent years. An 11-year-old male suffered a penetrating domestic accident that resulted in complete foot drop. At surgery , a 6-cm gap was treated with direct nerve sutures , for which the knee was maintained in 60 Â° flexion in a cast. To avoid damage to the nerve sutures , ultrasound and an intense , though cautious physiotherapy program were employed to guide the progression of knee extension. The patient started to show clear signs of peroneal motor function recovery within 3 months of surgical repair , and almost complete recovery by 4 months postoperatively. Using physiotherapy and ultrasound might validate the classic joint-flexion technique in select patients with lower-limb nerve injuries.
