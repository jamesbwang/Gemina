 DNA metabarcoding is increasingly used in dietary studies to estimate diversity , composition and frequency of occurrence of prey items. However , few studies have assessed how technical and biological replication affect the accuracy of diet estimates. This study addresses these issues using the European free-tailed bat Tadarida teniotis , involving high-throughput sequencing of a small fragment of the COI gene in 15 separate faecal pellets and a 15-pellet pool per each of 20 bats. We investigated how diet descriptors were affected by variability among ( a) individuals , ( b) pellets of each individual and ( c) PCRs of each pellet. In addition , we investigated the impact of ( d) analysing separate pellets vs. pellet pools. We found that diet diversity estimates increased steadily with the number of pellets analysed per individual , with seven pellets required to detect ~ 80 % of prey species. Most variation in diet composition was associated with differences among individual bats , followed by pellets per individual and PCRs per pellet. The accuracy of frequency of occurrence estimates increased with the number of pellets analysed per bat , with the highest error rates recorded for prey consumed infrequently by many individuals. Pools provided poor estimates of diet diversity and frequency of occurrence , which were comparable to analysing a single pellet per individual , and consistently missed the less common prey items. Overall , our results stress that maximizing biological replication is critical in dietary metabarcoding studies and emphasize that analysing several samples per individual rather than pooled samples produce more accurate results.
