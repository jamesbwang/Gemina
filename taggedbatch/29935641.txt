 To determine whether ( 1) exposure of embryos to 5 % oxygen ( O Randomized controlled trial. Academic medical center. Bipronucleate and tripronucleate embryos donated for research. On D1 , sibling zygotes were randomized to culture in 5 % O Developmental stage and grade; D5 total cell counts; mass spectrometry of spent media; quantitative polymerase chain reaction of 21 genes in inner cell mass and trophectoderm. Among cleaved embryos ( n = 176 , 87 %) , those in the 2 % group were less likely to arrest at the cleavage stage on D5 ( 34 of 87 , 39.1 %) compared with the 5 % group ( 52 of 89 , 58.4 %) ( adjusted odds ratio 0.38 , 95 % confidence interval 0.18-0.80). Those in the 2 % group were more likely to blastulate ( 35 of 87 , 40.2 %) than those in the 5 % group ( 20 of 89 , 22.5 %) ( adjusted odds ratio 2.55 , 95 % confidence interval 1.27-5.12). Culture in 2 % O These findings provide foundational evidence for future investigation of 2 % O
