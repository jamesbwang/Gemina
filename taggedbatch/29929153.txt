 Pain and anxiety<symptom> are understudied despite their importance to the general medical condition. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of pain and anxiety<symptom> and their relationship to the doses of opioids and anxiolytics administered in intensive care unit ( ICU) patients. The subjects included 1349 conscious , critically ill patients admitted to an ICU. Psychiatrists evaluated the patients daily for pain and anxiety<symptom>. Data regarding the doses of opioids and benzodiazepines administered were gathered. Linear mixed model was used for analysis. The pain and anxiety<symptom> experienced by patients in the ICU were significantly correlated. Pain had significant main effects on the dose of opioids administered. No significant effects of anxiety<symptom> on the daily dose of anxiolytics or opioids given were detected. Due to their closely linked relationship , pain and anxiety<symptom> , can affect one another , and one can influence the other to appear more severe. In addition , anxiety<symptom> can be underestimated in ICU patients. The present study suggests the need for precise evaluation and a comprehensive approach to the management of pain and anxiety<symptom>. In addition , this study implies that management of anxiety<symptom> may affect pain reduction , given the close correlation between the two.
