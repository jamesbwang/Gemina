 Human<disease> infections<disease> with the H7N9 virus could lead to lung damage and even multiple<symptom> organ<symptom> failure<symptom> , which is closely associated with a high mortality rate. However , the metabolic basis of such systemic alterations remains unknown. This study included hospitalized patients ( n = 4) with laboratory-confirmed H7N9 infection , healthy controls ( n = 9) , and two disease control groups comprising patients with pneumonia<disease> ( n = 9) and patients with pneumonia<disease> who received steroid treatment ( n = 10). One H7N9-infected patient underwent lung biopsy for histopathological analysis and expression analysis of genes associated with lung homeostasis. H7N9-induced systemic alterations were investigated using metabolomic analysis of sera collected from the four patients by using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Chest digital radiography and laboratory tests were also conducted. Two of the four patients did not survive the clinical treatments with antiviral medication , steroids , and oxygen therapy. Biopsy revealed disrupted expression of genes associated with lung epithelial integrity. Histopathological analysis demonstrated severe lung inflammation<symptom> after H7N9 infection. Metabolomic analysis indicated that fatty acid metabolism may be inhibited during H7N9 infection. Serum levels of palmitic acid , erucic acid , and phytal may negatively correlate with the extent of lung inflammation<symptom> after H7N9 infection. The changes in fatty acid levels may not be due to steroid treatment or pneumonia<disease>. Altered structural and secretory properties of the lung epithelium may be associated with the severity of H7N9-infection-induced lung disease. Moreover , fatty acid metabolism level may predict a fatal outcome after H7N9 virus infection.
