 The development of better eye and body tracking systems , and more flexible virtual environments have allowed more systematic exploration of natural vision and contributed a number of insights. In natural visually guided behaviour , humans make continuous sequences of sensory-motor decisions to satisfy current goals , and the role of vision is to provide the relevant information in order to achieve those goals. This paper reviews the factors that control gaze in natural visually guided actions such as locomotion , including the rewards and costs associated with the immediate behavioural goals , uncertainty about the state of the world and prior knowledge of the environment. These general features of human gaze control may inform the development of artificial systems.
