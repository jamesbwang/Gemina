 During the immediate postnatal period , the liver , with its role in energy metabolism and macromolecule synthesis , playsa central role in the perinatal transition. Using RNA microarrays and several complementary computational analyses , we characterized changes in hepatic gene expression in the rat across a developmental period starting with the late gestation fetus ( embryonic day 21) , and including 30 min postnatal ( PN) , 4 hr PN , 12 hr PN , 1 day PN and 1 week after birth. Following subtle changes in gene expression at the earliest postnatal time point , there were marked changes that occurred between 4 hr and 12 hr after birth. These reflected changes in multiple metabolic pathways , with expression of enzymes involved in glycolysis and cholesterol synthesis showing the greatest change. Over 50 % of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes changed in the first 7 days of postnatal life , with 25 % changing within the first 24 hr. We also observed changes coinciding with a transient period of synchronous hepatocyte proliferation that we had observed previously , which occurs during the first postnatal week. Analysis for upstream regulators of gene expression indicated multiple initiating factors , including cell stress , hormones and cytokines. Also implicated were multiple canonical transcription factor networks. We conclude that changes in gene expression during the early phases of the perinatal transition involve a complex , choreographed network of signaling pathways that respond to a variety of environmental stimuli. This transcriptomic response during the immediate postnatal period reflects a complex metabolic adaptive response that incorporates a panoply of signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators.
