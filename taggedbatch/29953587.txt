 Pharmacoresistance is a problem affecting ∼ 30 % of chronic epilepsy patients. An understanding of the mechanisms of pharmacoresistance requires a precise understanding of how antiepileptic drugs interact with their targets in control and epileptic tissue. Although the effects of ( S)- licarbazepine ( S-Lic) on sodium channel fast inactivation are well understood and have revealed maintained activity in epileptic tissue , it is not known how slow inactivation processes are affected by S-Lic in epilepsy. We have used voltage clamp recordings in isolated dentate granule cells ( DGCs) and cortical pyramidal neurons of control versus chronically epileptic rats ( pilocarpine model of epilepsy) and in DGCs isolated from hippocampal specimens from temporal lobe epilepsy patients to examine S-Lic effects on sodium channel slow inactivation. S-Lic effects on entry into and recovery from slow inactivation were negligible , even at high concentrations of S-Lic ( 300 μmol/L). Much more pronounced S-Lic effects were observed on the voltage dependence of slow inactivation , with significant effects at 100 μmol/L S-Lic in DGCs from control and epileptic rats or temporal lobe epilepsy patients. For none of these effects of S-Lic could we observe significant differences either between sham-control and epileptic rats , or between human DGCs and the two animal groups. S-Lic was similarly effective in cortical pyramidal neurons from sham-control and epileptic rats. Finally , we show in expression systems that S-Lic effects on slow inactivation voltage dependence are only observed in Na From these data , we conclude that a major mechanism of action of S-Lic is an effect on slow inactivation , primarily through effects on slow inactivation voltage dependence of Na
