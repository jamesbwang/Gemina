 Band erosion is one late complication of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding ( LAGB) , with the reported incidence between 1 % and 28 %. Far less common is oesophageal adenocarcinoma after LAGB , with only three cases previously described. Here we report a single case of complete gastric inlet obstruction with oesophageal adenocarcinoma and complete internalization of a gastric band 19 years after its placement.
