 Small cell carcinoma ( SCC) of the larynx is a rare type of neuroendocrine carcinoma ( NEC) , few cases of which have been described in the literature. The prognosis for this type of carcinoma is poor , with a survival time typically not exceeding two years. We describe the case of a 54-year-old male patient with a primary tumor in the right ventricular band and a biopsy compatible with SCC. The patient underwent radiotherapy ( RT) and concomitant chemotherapy ( QT) and , after a relapse at 17 months , underwent total laryngectomy with bilateral neck dissection. The survival time was 47 months. Further studies are required to elucidate the possible causes of the better prognosis in some cases.
