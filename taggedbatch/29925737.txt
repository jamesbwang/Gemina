 Many mothers in the postpartum period complain of fatigue<symptom> and shortened sleeping time because of child care. Breastfeeding , especially in the early postpartum period , accounts for a large share of this problem. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of breastfeeding on the sleep of mothers in the postpartum period , using 2 questionnaires: a self-created questionnaire for a survey of breastfeeding , and the OSA sleep inventory MA version for sleeping mothers. We performed the investigation twice , at 5-8 days and at one month after childbirth. The results showed that there was no significant difference in sleep between labor histories and delivery methods , but on the other hand , the exclusive breastfeeding group had a higher score about recovery and sleep length in the night during hospitalization ( P < 0.05). In addition , the group of mothers in the lying down breastfeeding position ( = Soechichi) group had higher scores in regards to their recovery than the other group in the night ( P < 0.05). The exclusive breastfeeding group and the soechichi group also had a higher quality of sleep in both day and night at one month after childbirth. Comparing the quality of sleep between the term of hospitalization and one month after childbirth , it improved after a month , because the mothers had gotten used to breastfeeding and understood their baby 's rhythm of breastfeeding after having spent a month together. We conclude that exclusive breastfeeding and the lying down breastfeeding position will provide a better quality of sleep for mothers.
