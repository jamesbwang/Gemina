 A new low-cost , indigenously manufactured , non-valved glaucoma drainage device ( GDD) has been introduced and its design is based on the Baerveldt Glaucoma Device. We aim to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of this GDD ( Aurolab aqueous drainage implant , AADI) vis-Ã -vis the valved device , Ahmed glaucoma valve ( AGV) , in the management of refractory glaucomas. Retrospective , comparative , interventional. Case review of consecutive patients who underwent GDD surgery by a single fellowship-trained surgeon at a Tertiary Centre between January 2014 and November 2016. Intraocular pressure ( IOP). Antiglaucoma medication ( AGM) , LogMAR best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA) , complications. A total of 88 eyes of 83 patients were included; 36 eyes received AGV and 52 AADI. Preoperative parameters were similar between groups. Median follow-up was 13 and 12 months for AADI and AGV , respectively. Overall success rate was higher in AADI ( 92.3 %) vs AGV ( 80.5 %) ( p < 0.001). The median IOP in mm Hg ( Quartiles; IQR) ( AADI 14 ( 10,15; 5) vs AGV 16 ( 14,20; 6)) and AGM ( AADI: 0 ( 0,1; 1) vs AGV 2 ( 1,2.75; 1.75)) was significantly lower in the AADI group at last follow-up ( p < 0.001). LogMAR BCVA improved in both groups; complication rates ( AADI 44.2 % vs AGV 52.7 %) were comparable ( p = 0.59). Both procedures were effective in reduction of IOP and need for AGM. Nevertheless , overall success rate was higher in the AADI group and IOP and number of AGM required was significantly lower in the AADI group; this affordable GDD could have a tremendous impact in the management of refractory glaucomas in low-income to middle-income countries.
