 Sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB) was created to reduce the morbidity associated with pelvic lymphadenectomy in the early stages of cervical cancer ( CC) , preserving its prognostic information. The goal is to assess the diagnostic validity of SLNB in CC in initial stages ( IA1 with lymphovascular infiltration ( LVI) + , IA2 , IB1 and IIA1) , thus avoiding unnecessary lymphadenectomies in many of the cases. From January 2012 to April 2017 , 23 patients with initial stages of CC were included in a cross-sectional study to evaluate the effectiveness of the SLNB in CC with a mixed technique of cervical injection of The detection rate of SLNB with the mixed technique was 95.65 % , with a negative predictive value ( NPV) of 95.45 % and sensitivity ( S) of 100 % in the case of bilateral drainage. The mean of excised SN was 3 ( range 1-5). The bilateral detection rate in laparoscopy was 85.35 %. The concordance between SPECT/CT and laparoscopy for the number and bilaterality of the SN using the Pearson coefficient was r = 0.727 and r = 0.833 , respectively; p = 0.01. We only found one SN with a deferred result of micromet√°stasis and one false negative was detected. SLNB in CC using a mixed technique has a high detection and bilateral drainage rate , but S is still low if we include cases of unilateral drainage. A greater number of cases and the development of intraoperative ultrastaging could increase the S of the technique and to reduce the number of false negatives.
