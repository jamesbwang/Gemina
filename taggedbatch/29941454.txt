 One feature of diabetes is the failure of pancreatic β cells to produce insulin , but he molecular mechanisms leading to this failure remain unclear. Increasing evidence supports a role for protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase ( PERK) in the development and function of healthy pancreatic β cells. Previously , our group identified the adaptor protein Nck1 as a negative regulator of PERK. Indeed , we demonstrated that Nck1 , by directly binding PERK autophosphorylated on Tyr561 , limits PERK activation and signaling. Accordingly , we found that stable depletion of Nck1 in β cells promotes PERK activation and signaling , increases insulin biosynthesis , and improves cell viability in response to diabetes-related stresses. Herein , we explored the therapeutic potential of abrogating the interaction between Nck and PERK to improve β cell function and survival. To do so , we designed and used a peptide containing the minimal PERK sequence involved in binding Nck1 conjugated to the cell-permeable protein transduction domain from the HIV<pathogen> protein TAT. In the current study , we confirm that the synthetic TAT-pY561 phosphopeptide specifically binds the SH2 domain of Nck and prevents Nck interaction with PERK , thereby promoting basal PERK activation. Moreover , we report that treatment of β cells with TAT-pY561 inhibits glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis , while it enhances insulin production and secretion. Taken together , our results support the potential of sequestering Nck using a synthetic peptide to enhance basal PERK activation and create more robust β cells.
