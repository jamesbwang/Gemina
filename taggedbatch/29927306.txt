 The goal of this study was to examine the costs associated with witnessing the sexual harassment of a male colleague. More specifically , we investigate ( a) whether observed male gender harassment is related to psychological and physical health , and negative and positive job-related behaviors and attitudes , and ( b) the mediating roles of discrete negative emotions ( anger , fear) and identity-based evaluations ( collective self-esteem). We explore these questions in a sample of men and women employed in `` blue collar '' professions. Our results show that the relationships between observed male gender harassment and psychological and physical health symptoms , withdrawal and workplace deviance , and affective commitment , were indirect and mediated via witness anger. Moreover , witnessing the gender harassment of a male colleague was also indirectly related to workplace deviance via collective self-esteem among women. Implications for theory , research , and practice are considered. ( PsycINFO Database Record
