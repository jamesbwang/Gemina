 Atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta is relatively common. However chronic stenosis of the infrarenal aorta is a fairly rare condition that has been traditionally treated with open endarterectomy and aorto-bifemoral bypass surgery. These surgeries may be associated with a significant increase in mortality and morbidity. Using 2 case examples we describe the feasibility of endovascular treatment of severely calcified infra-abdominal aortic lesion<symptom> using a transradial endovascular approach that greatly reduce both vascular and access site complications.
