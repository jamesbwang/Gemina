 Anal squamous cell carcinoma is primarily treated with radiotherapy ( RT) , but the optimal RT dose for anal tumours of different sizes is not known. The purpose of this study was to identify determinants for local tumour control probability ( LTCP). From a large Nordic database 901 patients who received RT for anal cancer between 2000 and 2007 were selected. LTCP was analysed in a series of uni- and multivariable regression analyses. Higher RT dose , female gender and addition of chemotherapy were associated with higher LTCP whereas increasing tumour size , tumour invasiveness ( stage T4) and lymph node metastases ( N +) were associated with lower LTCP. Male patients needed approximately 10 Gy higher RT dose than female patients for similar LTCP. The addition of chemotherapy corresponded to 5-10 Gy RT dose. Our results basically support current guidelines recommending: ( 1) lower RT dose in small tumours ( < 4 cm) , ( 2) higher RT dose larger tumours and in stages T4 and/ or N + , ( 3) Chemo should be used in combination with RT.. These results will hopefully constitute the basis for future trials , aiming at individualized RT dosing in patients with anal cancer.
