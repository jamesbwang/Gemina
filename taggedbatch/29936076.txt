 Cancer multidisciplinary meetings ( MDMs) are central to treatment decision making. The language used in MDMs may influence treatment decisions , yet has received little research attention. This study aimed to examine the terminology used to describe non-cancer items in the discussion of older people within cancer MDMs. MDMs of four tumour streams were attended over twelve weeks. For each person aged 70 or older discussed , the following was hand recorded: age , gender , and phrases describing non-cancer items and patient views. A qualitative thematic analysis was employed to examine the text. Twenty cancer MDMs were attended , at which 71 people aged 70 or older were discussed. Age , comorbid medical conditions , and general descriptors emerged as the areas in which non-cancer information was presented. In contrast to the medical terminology used to describe comorbid medical conditions , non-specific general descriptors , such as ` fit ' , ` well ' , and ` good ' , were used to describe other aspects of older people. Adverbs , including ` very ' , ` pretty ' , and ` quite ' , often accompanied general descriptors. The , often subtle , intonation and context associated with these adverbs resulted in markedly different meanings. Non-objective , potentially ambiguous general descriptors were commonly used to encompass non-disease aspects of older people in cancer MDMs. These descriptors may have the potential to sway treatment recommendations. However , their frequent use suggests team members recognise that non-disease aspects of a person , aside from chronological age , are considerations in treatment recommendations. Therefore , strategies to increase discussion of non-cancer items in a more objective manner may be acceptable to MDM attendees.
