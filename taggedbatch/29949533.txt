 Cancer , inflammation<symptom> and immune surveillance recruit lymphocytes as common key cellular players. The aim of the study was to assess a utility of the absolute and relative lymphocyte<symptom> counts ( ALC and RLC) in peripheral blood of patients with urological cancer as sensitive tool in pretreatment assessment of patient , which correlates with postoperative outcome of the disease , and outlines the overall reactivity of the patient. We retrospectively studied correlation between lymphocyte<symptom> count in peripheral blood of the patients with urological cancer ( n = 789) and number of clinical parameters: cancer localization , stage of the disease , treatment outcome , complications. Mann - Whitney two-tailed test and logistic regression models were used. Lymphocyte<symptom> counts ( both absolute and relative) correlate with the cancer stage , and status of the disease , allowing differentiate patients with urological cancer , from healthy individuals , and from the cancer patients after radical surgery. In patients with kidney and bladder cancer , lymphocyte<symptom> count allowed differentiate the stages of the disease. Lower rate of the reactivity of the patient to the cancer treatment is accurately predicted by the ALC and RLC: those in highest quartile for lymphocytes count have shorter postoperative recovery. Patients in lowest quartile demonstrated worst postoperative performance , including cases of early postoperative mortality due to weak somatic status. The study presents evidence that pretreatment lymphocyte<symptom> count in the peripheral blood of patients with urological cancer is a sensitive marker of cancer stage , and the reactivity of the patient to the cancer treatment , which can be used in the pretreatment assessment of the patient.
