 Plants have the ability to adapt themselves under stressed conditions through reprogramming their growth and development. Understanding the mechanisms regulating overall growth of stressed plant is an important issue for plant and environmental biology research. Although the role of NO in modulating arsenic ( As) toxicity is known , nitric oxide ( NO) induced alteration in auxin and nutrient related transporters during As stress in rice is poorly understood. Experimental results showed that As exposure decreased gene expression level of polar auxin transporter ( PIN proteins) , and nutrient transporter related genes ( AMT , NRT , NiR , PHT , KTP). The improved tolerance induced by As + NO combination is attributed to reduced As accumulation in rice seedlings , improved root architectural changes , overall growth of plant , chlorophyll , protein content , and accumulation of mineral nutrients by reducing the ROS generation. Further , enhanced transcript levels of PIN proteins and mineral nutrition related genes were also observed under As + NO treatment. Additional biochemical data revealed enhanced oxidative stress by increasing the level of antioxidant enzymes , and stress-related parameters. Overall , the study provides an integrated view of plant response during As + NO interaction to change the plant metabolism through different cellular processes.
