 `` Glycoreplica peptides '' are prepared using a phage display peptide library and monoclonal antibodies that recognize the carbohydrate epitopes of glycoconjugate antigens. The peptides obtained not only mimic the shapes of original glycoconjugate antigens but also have some of their functions. We herein describe how to identify the amino acid alignments of glycoreplica peptides using phage display selection against carbohydrate-binding proteins. Target-specific peptides and proteins may be selected from the large repertory of a peptide/protein library using phage display technology. Glycoreplica peptides have the potential to become alternatives to carbohydrate ligands such as mimotopes for vaccinations and carbohydrate-derived drugs for carbohydrate-related diseases.
