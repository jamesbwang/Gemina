 To examine the impacts of fireworks , size-resolved PM samples were collected using a single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer before , during and after the Spring Festival in a megacity in Chengdu , China. Chemical composition and atmospheric behavior of urban particles were studied. Ten major single particle types were resolved with ART-2a algorithm including elemental and organic carbon ( ECOC) , EC , OC , levoglucosan ( LEV) , high molecular weight organic molecules ( HOM) , hard metal ( HM) , K rich , Na rich and SiO
