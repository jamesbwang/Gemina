 Total dietary fat intake might influence the risk of fracture; however , conflicting findings have been reported to date. Moreover , the type of fatty acids is also of vital importance. We aimed to conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on the association between dietary fat intake , saturated fatty acids ( SFAs) , monounsaturated fatty acids ( MUFAs) , and the risk of fracture. PubMed and Scopus were used to conduct a comprehensive search for articles published up to 7 January 2018. To pool effect sizes , random effects models ( the DerSimonian-Laird method) were applied. The Cochrane Q test was used to trace the source of between-study heterogeneity. Six studies met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. We found no significant association between total dietary fat intake and risk of fracture ( pooled effect size 1.31 , 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI) 0.95-1.79 , P = 0.09). A significant positive association was observed between SFA intake and the risk of hip fracture ( pooled effect size 1.79 , 95 % CI 1.05-3.03 , P = 0.03). There was also a significant positive association between MUFAs derived from animal sources and the risk of fracture ( pooled effect size 2.29 , 95 % CI 1.50-3.50 , P < 0.0001). Our findings showed a strong positive association between SFAs intake and risk of hip fracture. Moreover , there was a significant positive association between MUFAs derived from animal sources and the risk of fracture.
