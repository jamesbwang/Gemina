 Cluster of differentiation ( CD) 8 + CD57 + T cells are derived through the CD8 + T cell-differentiation signaling pathway from early differentiated CD27 + CD8 + CD57-T cells ( early-CD8 + T cells) to terminal-differentiated CD27-CD8 + CD57 + T cells ( terminal-CD8 + T cells) via intermediate-differentiated CD27 + CD8 + CD57 + T cells ( intermediate-CD8 + T cells). The increase of CD8 + CD57 + T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with cancer has been associated with prognosis , which suggests their suitability as a candidate immunological marker. The present study investigated the association of these CD57-related CD8 + T cell populations in the peripheral blood of 100 Stage IV cancer patients with progression-free survival ( PFS) , using a Cox regression model. Univariate analysis indicated that early- and intermediate-CD8 + T cells were associated with shorter PFS , whereas terminal-CD8 + T cells were associated with longer PFS. A strong inverse correlation was observed between early- and terminal-CD8 + T cells , and multivariate analysis demonstrated that the CD57 ratio ( terminal-CD8 + T cells/early-CD 8 + T cells) was a more significant independent prognostic factor compared with early- or terminal-CD8 + T cells. Patients with a higher CD57 ratio had a significantly longer PFS compared with those with a lower CD57 ratio , in whom terminal-CD8 + T cells were supposed to be predominant. Conversely , results indicated inhibition of the CD8 + T cell differentiation signaling pathway in patients with a low CD57 ratio , which lead to a predominance of early-CD8 + T cells , a characteristic of immunosuppressive cells. The present findings suggested that the CD57 ratio appears to be a powerful immunological prognostic parameter obtained from the peripheral blood , precisely reflecting the state of CD8 + T cell-differentiation.
