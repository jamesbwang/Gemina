 Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> bloodstream infections ( SABIs) represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. In this study , we compared infection characteristics and evaluated epidemiology and risk factors associated to SABIs and 30-day attributable mortality in cancer patients. Clinical and microbiological data from patients with cancer and positive blood cultures for S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> were retrieved during a 10-year period at an oncology reference center. Analyses were performed according to type of malignancy and infection with methicillin-resistant S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA). Data was evaluated using competing risk analyses to identify risk factors associated to 30-day mortality and used to create a point system for mortality risk stratification. We included 450 patients and MRSA was documented in 21.1 %. Hospital-acquired infection , healthcare-associated pneumonia<disease> , and type-2 diabetes were associated to MRSA. In patients with hematologic malignancies , MRSA was more frequent if hospital-acquired , but less likely in primary bacteremia. Variables associated to mortality included abdominal source of infection , hematologic malignancy , MRSA , glucose levels > 140 mg/dL , and infectious endocarditis<disease>; catheter removal and initiation of adequate treatment within 48 h of positive blood culture were protective factors. From our designed mortality prediction scale , patients with a score > 3 had a 70.23 % ( 95 % CI 47.2-85.3 %) probability of infection-related death at 30 days. SABIs are a significant health burden for cancer patients. Risk factors for SABI-related mortality in this population are varied and impose a challenge for management to improve patient 's outcomes. Risk stratification might be useful to evaluate 30-day mortality risk.
