 Inhospital mortality from nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding has improved with advances in medical and endoscopy therapy. Initial management includes resuscitation , hemodynamic monitoring , proton pump inhibitor therapy , and restrictive blood transfusion. Risk stratification scores help triage bleeding severity and provide prognosis. Upper<symptom> endoscopy is recommended within 24 hours of presentation; select patients at lowest risk may be effectively treated as outpatients. Emergent endoscopy within 12 hours does not improve clinical outcomes , including mortality , rebleeding , or need for surgery , despite an increased use of endoscopic treatment. There may be a benefit to emergent endoscopy in patients with evidence of active bleeding.
