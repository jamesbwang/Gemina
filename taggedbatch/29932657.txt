 Apios americana<pathogen> is an important food crop producing edible tubers with high nutritional and medicinal values and is widely cultivated in many countries. Despite its usefulness , research on its secondary metabolites and biological activities has been limited. In the present study , a new coumaronochromone , ( 2 R ,3 S) -3,7,4 '- trihydroxy-5-methoxycoumaronochromone ( 1) , and two new isoflavone glucosides , 7,2 ' ,4 '- trihydroxy-5-methoxyisoflavone-4 '- O-β-d-glucopyranoside ( 3) and 5,7,4 '- trihydroxyisoflavone-7- O-β-d-gentiotrioside ( 5) , were isolated from the tubers of A. americana<pathogen> via chromatographic separation. Seventeen known compounds ( 2 , 4 , and 6-20) were also obtained from this plant part. The chemical structures of 1 , 3 , and 5 were determined by the interpretation of spectroscopic data. The absolute structure of the new compound 1 was established from experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism spectra. This is the first study to determine the absolute configuration of a 3-hydroxycoumaronochromone derivative. The potential anti-inflammatory activity of the 20 isolates obtained was evaluated by measuring their inhibitory effects on nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Among the isolates , seven compounds ( 1 , 3 , 6-8 , 15 , and 20) showed substantial inhibition of nitric oxide production in RAW 264.7 cells , with the most active being compound 1 ( IC
