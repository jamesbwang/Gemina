 In 1954 , a virus named Wad Medani virus ( WMV) was isolated from Hyalomma marginatum ticks from Maharashtra State , India. In 1963 , another virus was isolated from Sturnia pagodarum birds in Tamil Nadu , India , and named Kammavanpettai virus ( KVPTV) based on the site of its isolation. Originally these virus isolates could not be identified with conventional methods. Here we describe next-generation sequencing studies leading to the determination of their complete genome sequences , and identification of both virus isolates as orbiviruses ( family Reoviridae). Sequencing data showed that KVPTV has an AT-rich genome , whereas the genome of WMV is GC-rich. The size of the KVPTV genome is 18 234 nucleotides encoding proteins ranging 238-1290 amino acids ( aa) in length. Similarly , the size of the WMV genome is 16 941 nucleotides encoding proteins ranging 214-1305 amino acids in length. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene , along with the capsid genes VP5 and VP7 , revealed that KVPTV is likely a novel mosquito-borne virus and WMV is a tick-borne orbivirus. This study focuses on the phylogenetic comparison of these newly identified orbiviruses with mosquito- , tick- and Culicoides-borne orbiviruses isolated in India and other countries.
