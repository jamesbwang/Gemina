 In hemolytic diseases , such as sickle cell disease ( SCD) , intravascular hemolysis<symptom> results in the release of hemoglobin , heme , and heme-loaded membrane microvesicles in the bloodstream. Intravascular hemolysis<symptom> is thus associated with inflammation<symptom> and organ injury. Complement system can be activated by heme in vitro. We investigated the mechanisms by which hemolysis<symptom> and red blood cell ( RBC) degradation products trigger complement activation in vivo. In kidney biopsies of SCD nephropathy patients and a mouse model with SCD , we detected tissue deposits of complement C3 and C5b-9. Moreover , drug-induced intravascular hemolysis<symptom> or injection of heme or hemoglobin in mice triggered C3 deposition , primarily in kidneys. Renal injury markers ( Kim-1 , NGAL) were attenuated in C3-/- hemolytic mice. RBC degradation products , such as heme-loaded microvesicles and heme , induced alternative and terminal complement pathway activation in sera and on endothelial surfaces , in contrast to hemoglobin. Heme triggered rapid P selectin , C3aR , and C5aR expression and downregulated CD46 on endothelial cells. Importantly , complement deposition was attenuated in vivo and in vitro by heme scavenger hemopexin. In conclusion , we demonstrate that intravascular hemolysis<symptom> triggers complement activation in vivo , encouraging further studies on its role in SCD nephropathy. Conversely , heme inhibition using hemopexin may provide a novel therapeutic opportunity to limit complement activation in hemolytic diseases.
