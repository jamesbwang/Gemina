 Influenza<pathogen><disease> A<pathogen> ( H3N2<pathogen>) viruses<pathogen> are associated with outbreaks worldwide and can cause disease with severe complications. The impact can be reduced by vaccination , which induces neutralizing antibodies that mainly target the haemagglutinin glycoprotein ( HA). In this study we generated neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs) against A/Victoria/361/ 2011 and identified their epitopes by generating and sequencing escape viruses. The epitopes are located in antigenic site B , which is near the receptor-binding site and is immunodominant in humans. Amino acid ( aa) substitutions at positions 156 , 158 , 159 , 189 , 190 and 193 in antigenic site B led to reduced ability of mAbs to block receptor-binding. The majority of A ( H3N2<pathogen>) viruses<pathogen> that have been circulating since 2014 are antigenically distinct from previous A ( H3N2<pathogen>) viruses<pathogen>. The neutralization-sensitive epitopes in antigenic site B of currently circulating viruses were examined with these mAbs. We found that clade 3C .2 a viruses , possessing an additional potential glycosylation site at HA1 position N158 , were poorly recognized by some of the mAbs , but other residues , notably at position 159 , also affected antibody binding. Through a mass spectrometric ( MS) analysis of HA , the glycosylated sites of HA1 were established and we determined that residue 158 of HA1 was glycosylated and so modified a neutralization-sensitive epitope. Understanding and monitoring individual epitopes is likely to improve vaccine strain selection.
