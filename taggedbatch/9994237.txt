 Andreev bound states ( ABSs) ubiquitously emerge as a consequence of non-trivial topological structures of the order parameter of superfluids and superconductors and significantly contribute to thermodynamics and low-energy quantum transport phenomena. We here share the current status of our knowledge on their multifaceted properties such as Majorana fermions and odd-frequency pairing. A unified concept behind ABSs originates from a soliton state in the one-dimensional Dirac equation with mass domain wall and interplay of ABSs with symmetry and topology enrich their physical characteristics. We make an overview of ABSs with a special focus on superfluid
