 The purpose of this study was to systematically review and critically analyze the published data of in vitro studies testing the effect of root canal sealers on the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth. A comprehensive literature search was performed by using the Medline , Scopus , Web of Science , Cochrane , and Open Grey databases. A hand search of the reference lists of identified articles was also performed. Two reviewers critically assessed the studies for eligibility against inclusion and exclusion criteria and performed data extraction. Evaluation of the risk of bias of the studies was performed. A total of 48 studies were assessed for eligibility. Of these , 20 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. All studies had a medium or high risk of bias. Although the majority of the studies reported that the use of root canal sealers increased the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth , conflicting evidence was found for the reinforcing effect of resin , glass ionomer , and calcium silicate-based sealers while there was moderate evidence for zinc oxide eugenol-based sealers in favor of no reinforcing effect. On the basis of available evidence , the use of root canal sealer increases the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth. However , included studies presented considerable risk of bias. Regarding the comparisons among the sealers , no conclusions could be drawn for the superiority of one sealer type to another. A considerable heterogeneity was found in the methodologies of included studies. Therefore , this review strongly suggests the development of standardized methods to test the reinforcement effect of root canal filling materials in in vitro studies.
