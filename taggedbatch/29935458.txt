 Degradation of a diclofenac aqueous solution was performed using persulfate anions activated by ultrasound. The objective of this study was to analyze different parameters affecting the diclofenac ( DCF) removal reaction by the ultrasonic persulfate ( US/PS) process and to evaluate the role played by various intermediate oxidative species such as hydroxyl- and sulfate radicals , superoxide radical anion or singlet oxygen in the removal process as well as to determine a possible reaction pathway. The effects of pH , initial persulfate anion concentration , ultrasonic amplitude and temperature on DCF degradation were examined. Sulfate and hydroxyl radicals were involved in the main reaction pathway of diclofenac. Diclofenac amide and three hydroxy-diclofenac isomers ( 3 '- hydroxy diclofenac , 4 '- hydroxy diclofenac and 5-hydroxy diclofenac) were identified as reaction intermediates.
