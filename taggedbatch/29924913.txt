 Chemotherapy is one of the most effective forms of cancer treatment. It has been widely used in the treatment of various malignant tumors. In order to investigate molecular mechanisms responsible for the chemoresistance of anaplastic thyroid cancer ( ATC) , we established the doxorubicin ( Dox) resistance of human ATC SW1736 and 8305C cells and named them SW1736/Dox and 8305C/Dox , respectively. We evaluated the expression of various micro-RNAs ( miRNAs) between control and Dox-resistant ATC cells and found that the expression of miR-27b-3p was significantly increased in Dox-resistant ATC cells. Targeted inhibition of miR-27b can increase the sensitivity of SW1736/Dox and 8305C/Dox cells. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that miR-27b can directly target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARγ) within the 3 ' untranslated region ( UTR). This was proved by the results that miR-27b-3p down-regulated the protein and mRNA levels of PPARγ. While the four-nucleotide substitution in the core binding sites of PPARγ abolished miR-27b-3p induced down-regulation of luciferase activity. Over-expression of PPARγ can increase the Dox sensitivity of SW1736/Dox and 8305C/Dox cells. Basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF) might be involved in miR-27b-3p/ PPARγ-regulated Dox resistance of ATC cells. The activation of p65 Nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB) regulated the up-regulation of miR-27b-3p in Dox-resistant ATC cells. Collectively , our data revealed that miR-27b-3p/ PPARγ is involved in the Dox resistance of human ATC cells. It suggested that targeted inhibition of miR-27b-3p might be helpful to overcome the drug resistance of ATC cells. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
