 We introduce ICBdocker , a Docker environment that allows the annotation of functional and structural features of proteomes through a Python/Perl pipeline. DataTables pages make it easy to set up a web-resource for research groups with a focus on the same organisms or datasets. The results are available as tab-separated values ( tsv) files and HTML , allowing data analysis and browsing. The pipeline focuses on modularity and scalability , with capability of integrating with multiprocessing and high-performance computing clusters. ICBdocker is freely available on DockerHub at https://hub.docker.com/r/bordin89/icb/ Source code and documentation are available on GitHub at: https://github.com/bordin89/ICB_docker.
