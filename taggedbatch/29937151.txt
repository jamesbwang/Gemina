 The Working Group was established at the initiative of the General Board of the Polish Society of Epileptology ( PSE) to develop an expert position on the treatment of convulsive status epilepticus ( SE) in adults and children in Poland. Generalized convulsive SE is the most common form and also represents the greatest threat to life , highlighting the importance of the choice of appropriate therapeutic treatment. We present the therapeutic options separately for treatment during the early preclinical ( > 5-30min) , established ( 30-60min) , and refractory ( > 60 min) SE phases. This division is based on time and response to AEDs , and indicates a practical approach based on pathophysiological data. Benzodiazepines ( BZD) are the first-line drugs. In cases of ineffective first-line treatment and persistence of the seizure<symptom> , the use of second-line treatment: phenytoin , valproic acid or phenobarbital is required. SE that persists after the administration of benzodiazepines and phenytoin or another second-line AED at appropriate doses is defined as refractory and drug resistant and requires treatment in the intensive care unit ( ICU). EEG monitoring is essential during therapy at this stage. Anesthesia is typically continued for an initial period of 24h followed by a slow reversal and is re-established if seizures<symptom> recur. Anesthesia is usually administered either to the level of the `` burst suppression pattern '' or to obtain the `` EEG suppression '' pattern. Experts agree that close and early cooperation with a neurologist and anesthetist aiming to reduce the risk of pharmacoresistant cases is an extremely important factor in the treatment of patients with SE. This report has educational , practical and organizational aspects , outlining a standard plan for SE management in Poland that will improve therapeutic efficacy.
