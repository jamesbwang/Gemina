 Low circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1) are associated with endothelial dysfunction , subsequently leading to the development of cardiovascular disease. To better understand the early phases of vascular deterioration in a young , healthy population , we investigated , cross-sectionally , whether biomarkers of endothelial function ( intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1) , vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM-1) and von Willebrand factor antigen ( vWF We included 825 black and white men and women ( aged 20-30 years) and determined IGF-1 , IGF binding protein-3 ( IGFBP-3) , ICAM-1 , VCAM-1 and vWF In multivariable-adjusted regression analyses performed in the total group , VCAM-1 associated positively with IGFBP-3 ( β = 0.21; p < .001) and negatively with IGF-1/ IGFBP-3 ( β = -0.18; p < .001). ICAM-1 showed a borderline negative association with IGF-1 ( β = -0.09; p = .054) and IGF-1/ IGFBP-3 ( β = -0.08; p = .057). vWF VCAM-1 is beneficially associated with IGF-1 in a young healthy cohort , independent of sex , ethnicity , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and health behaviours- thereby confirming the potential importance of bioavailable IGF-1 in early vascular endothelial protection.
