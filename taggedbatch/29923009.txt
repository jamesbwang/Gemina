 А cross-sectional study was performed on a continuous sample of patients ( N = 52) with the gastroesophageal reflux disease. Specific features of this disease in patients with overweight were revealed. Regurgitation predominated in the structure of complaints. Fibrogastroduodenoscopy revealed endoscopically negative form of the diseases in 38 % of cases. According to 24-h pH monitoring results , alkaline reflux pH > 7 took more than 25 % time in supine position at high DeMeester score , which limits the usage of aggressive acid-lowering therapy.
