 Current research highlights a need to investigate the factors affecting periodontal<disease> disease<disease> referral. Limited literature exists on periodontal<disease> disease<disease> referral in Australia and no comparison to the periodontal<disease> disease<disease> referral guidelines exists. This study analyses the factors affecting periodontal<disease> disease<disease> referral and the adherence to guidelines in general dentists in Queensland , Australia. Fifty-seven general dentists who are members of the Australian Dental Association ( Queensland) undertook an online survey. The disease factor regarded as most important ( 90 % of respondents) was unresolved inflammation<symptom> upon re-evaluation. The non-disease factor regarded as most important ( 79 % of respondents) was the operator 's level of training. There is low awareness of the guidelines ( 36.7 %) yet a reasonable adherence to them ( 78.3 %). Of those aware of the guidelines , there was a statistically significant poorer adherence to the guidelines compared to those unaware ( P = 0.036) , while there is no significant difference in the adherence to guidelines between those who have and those who have not attended continuing professional development ( CPD) courses ( P = 0.66). Adherence to current guidelines is not significantly impacted by the level of awareness of the guidelines or CPD attendance. The results from this study suggest a need to refine the current guidelines to better inform decisions about periodontal<disease> disease<disease> referrals.
