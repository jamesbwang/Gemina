 Meta analysis was used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Dynesys and posterior decompression and fusion internal fixation for lumbar degenerative diseases. The computer was used to retrieve the Cochrane library , Medline , Embase , CNKI , Wanfang database and Chinese biomedical literature database; and the references and main Chinese and English Department of orthopedics journals were manually searched. All the prospective or retrospective comparative studies on the clinical efficacy and safety of Dynesys and posterior decompression and fusion internal fixation were collected , so as to evaluate the methodological quality of the study and to extract the data. The RevMan 5.2 software provided by Cochrane collaboration was used for systematic evaluation. A total of 9 clinical studies were included , including 3 prospective randomized controlled trials ( RCT) and 6 retrospective controlled observational studies , which included 692 patients , with 336 cases in Dynesys group , and 356 cases in posterior decompression and fusion internal fixation ( PLIF) group. The results showed that compared with PLIF , Dynesys system significantly decreased operation time ( Both Dynesys system and PLIF can improve clinical outcomes of lumbar degenerative diseases effectively. Compared with PLIF , Dynesys could remain the range of motion ( ROM) of surgical segments with less increased ROM of adjacent segments and lower complication incidence rate. But the ability to prevent adjacent segments degeneration needs more RCTs with long-term follow-up to confirm.
