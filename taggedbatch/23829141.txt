 Sports performance analysis has been a growing field of study in the last decade. However , the number of studies in handball is small. The aims of this present study were ( i) to compare handball game-related statistics by the match outcome ( winning and losing teams) and ( ii) to identify characteristics that discriminated performance in elite women 's handball. The game-related statistics of the 236 matches played in the last four Olympic Games ( Athens , Greece , 2004; Beijing , China , 2008; London , United Kingdom , 2012; and Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , 2016) were analysed. Differences between match outcomes ( winning or losing teams) were determined using the chi-squared statistic , also calculating the effect sizes of the differences. A discriminant analysis was then performed applying the sample-splitting method according to match outcomes. The results showed the differences between winning and losing teams were red cards and assists. Also , the discriminant analysis selected five variables ( shots , goalkeeper-blocked shots , technical fouls , steals , and goalkeeper-blocked fast-break shots) that classified correctly 83 % of matches. The selected variables included offensive and defensive predictors. Coaches and players can use these results as a reference against which to assess their performance and plan training.
