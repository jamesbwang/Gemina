 Camu-camu ( Myrciaria dubia) is a typical Amazonian fruit and has high antioxidant capacity due to its high levels of vitamin C and phenolic compounds. This study aimed to determine the phytochemicals , antioxidant capacity and antimutagenic effects of camu-camu fruits with different maturity stages grown in dry ( commercial cultivation) or flooded environments ( native cultivation , Amazon). Total polyphenols , ascorbic acid and in vitro antioxidant capacity levels were higher in ripe fruits grown in a commercial cultivation. The extracts from ripe camu-camu grown in a commercial cultivation exerted antioxidant effects and high percentage of protection against doxorubicin ( DXR) and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine ( DMH) in all tested systems ( liver , bone<disease> marrow and gut) , for three camu-camu extract concentrations ( 17 , 85 and 170 mg/kg b.w.) , as follows: bone<disease> marrow minocronucleus ( 37.91 % , 41.75 % , 43.95 %); micronucleus gut test ( 61.01 % , 64.40 % , 50.28 %); apoptosis index ( 60.26 % , 62.44 % , 58.22 %); comet assay through the tail moment ( 71.64 % , 72.31 % , 70.70 %) , % DNA in the tail ( 64.54 % , 68.75 % , 76.79 %) and tail intensity ( 76.43 % , 81.02 % , 68.33 %). The results of this study contribute to increase the production of camu-camu fruits grown in dry environments and their use as a health promoting food. This article is protected by copyright.
