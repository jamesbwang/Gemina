 Electromagnetic fields ( EMF) with different intensities are widely used at home , offices and public places.Today , there is a growing global concern about the effects of human exposure to EMFs. Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological diseases , affecting 50 million people of all ages worldwide. We aimed to investigate the effect of exposure to Wi-Fi radiation on epileptic<symptom> behavior<symptom> of rats. 147 male rats , weighing 200-250 g , were divided into seven groups; negative control ( no intervention) , sham 1 ( distilled water) , positive control ( Pentylentetrazol ( PTZ)) , intervention group 1 ( PTZ + Wi-Fi `` off '') , sham 2 ( distilled water + Wi-Fi `` off '') , sham 3 ( distilled water + Wi-Fi `` on '') , and intervention group 2 ( PTZ + Wi-Fi `` on ''). The rats were exposed to Wi-Fi for 2h at a distance of 30 cm from a commercial Wi-Fi router. Convulsive behaviors of rats were monitored and scored based on the intensity and type by measuring latency/threshold time , number of convulsions<symptom> , sum of scores and durations of seizure<symptom> , and duration of score 6 seizure<symptom>. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to analyze the data. Convulsion<symptom> was observed in interventions Group 4 and Group 7 , and positive control. The mean number of events , and sum of scores were significantly different in intervention 2 than other two groups. However , the differences in mean threshold , mean sum of durations and '' time to show convulsion<symptom> with score 6 '' were not statistically significant ( P > 0.05). Due to limitations of our study including the sample size , these findings should be interpreted with caution. In this study , exposure to 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi radiation showed significant beneficial effects on the epileptic behaviour of rats. More experiments are needed to verify if these exposures can be used as a therapeutic approach for amelioration of seizures<symptom> in epilepsy.
