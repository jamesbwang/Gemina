 GBF1 has emerged as a host factor required for the replication of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses of different families , but its mechanism of action is still unknown. GBF1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Arf family members. Recently , we identified Arf4 and Arf5 ( class II Arfs) as host factors required for the replication of hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) , a GBF1-dependent virus. To assess whether a GBF1/class II Arf pathway is conserved among positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses , we investigated yellow<pathogen><disease><symptom> fever<disease><symptom><pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( YFV) , Sindbis<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( SINV) , coxsackievirus<pathogen> B4 ( CVB4) and human<pathogen> coronavirus<pathogen> 229E<pathogen> ( HCoV-229E). We found that GBF1 is involved in the replication of these viruses. However , using siRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 technologies , it was seen that the depletion of Arf1 , Arf3 , Arf4 or Arf5 had no impact on viral replication. In contrast , the depletion of Arf pairs suggested that class II Arfs could be involved in HCoV-229E , YFV and SINV infection , as for HCV<pathogen> , but not in CVB4 infection. In addition , another Arf pair , Arf1 and Arf4 , appears to be essential for YFV and SINV infection , but not for infection by other viruses. Finally , CVB4 infection was not inhibited by any combination of Arf depletion. We conclude that the mechanism of action of GBF1 in viral replication appears not to be conserved , and that a subset of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses from different families might require class II Arfs for their replication.
