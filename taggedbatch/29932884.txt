 To examine the reliability and validity of Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS) measures of sleep disturbance and fatigue<symptom> in TBI caregivers and to determine the severity of fatigue<symptom> and sleep disturbance in these caregivers. Cross-sectional survey data collected through an online data capture platform. Four rehabilitation hospitals and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Caregivers ( N = 560) of civilians ( n = 344) and service member/veterans ( n = 216) with TBI. Not Applicable MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PROMIS sleep and fatigue<symptom> measures administered as both computerized adaptive tests ( CATs) and 4-item short forms ( SFs). For both samples , floor and ceiling effects for the PROMIS measures were low ( < 11 %) , internal consistency was very good ( all alphas ≥ 0.80) , and test-retest reliability was acceptable ( all r ≥ 0.70 except for the fatigue<symptom> CAT in the service member/veteran sample r = 0.63). Convergent validity was supported by moderate correlations between the PROMIS and related measures. Discriminant validity was supported by low correlations between PROMIS measures and measures of dissimilar constructs. PROMIS scores indicated significantly worse sleep and fatigue<symptom> for those caring for someone with high levels versus low levels of impairment. Findings support the reliability and validity of the PROMIS CAT and SF measures of sleep disturbance and fatigue<symptom> in caregivers of civilians and service members/veterans with TBI.
