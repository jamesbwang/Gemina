 Understanding the unique health needs of college students and establishing best practices to address them depend , heavily , on the inherent quality and contribution of the research identifying these needs. College health-focused publications currently exemplify less than ideal statistical reporting practices. Specifically , college health practitioners and researchers continue to rely heavily upon null hypothesis significance testing ( NHST) as the sole standard for effectiveness , validity , and/or replicability of scientific studies , even though NHST itself was not designed for such purposes. Herein we address the following questions: ( a) What is NHST? ( b) What are the inherent limitations of NHST? ( c) What are recommended alternatives to NHST? and ( d) How can editorial policies promote adopting NHST alternatives? Using college health data from the CORE 2011 Alcohol and Drug survey , we provide a heuristic example demonstrating how effect sizes do not suffer from the same limitations as NHST.
