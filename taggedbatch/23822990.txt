 Non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) accounts for ~ 80 % of human lung cancer cases and is the most common cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. Reports have indicated that tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL) and Iodine-131 ( I-131) can induce tumor cell apoptosis. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the additive efficacy of TRAIL and I-131 on NSCLC cells. The present study demonstrated that additive treatment of TRAIL and I-131 ( TRAIL-I-131) significantly inhibited the growth and aggressiveness of NSCLC cells compared with single TRAIL or I-131 treatment. Results demonstrated that TRAIL-I-131 treatment induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells , with western blot analysis confirming that TRAIL-I-131 treatment increased proapoptotic Bad and Bax expression levels , while antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-w protein levels were decreased in NSCLC cells. The present study demonstrated that TRAIL-I-131 treatment inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) and activator protein-1 ( AP-1) in NSCLC cells. Potential mechanism analyses identified that TRAIL-I-131 treatment induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells through caspase-9 activation.
