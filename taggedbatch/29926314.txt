 Stress and depressive symptoms are associated with maladaptive health behavior practices such as unhealthy eating , sedentary behavior , insufficient sleep , and substance use. The relative and interactive effects of stress and depressive symptoms on health behavior practices are less well understood. The present study examined these processes in a daily diary study of 127 college students. Results from hierarchical generalized linear models indicated that depressive symptoms , and chronic and daily stress , but not acute stressful life events , were significantly associated with a composite score of daily maladaptive health behavior engagement ( depressive symptoms b = .01 , SE = .00 , p < .01; chronic stress , b = .03 , SE = .01 , p < .01; daily stress , b = .01 , SE = .01 , p = .02); unexpectedly , the effect of stress on health behaviors was not moderated by depressive symptoms. Additionally , results demonstrated that the effect of depressive symptoms on health behaviors was mediated by fluctuations in daily negative affect. These results bear implications for intervention during a crucial period in the development of mental and physical health.
