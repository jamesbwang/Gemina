 The effect of hydrogenation of phospholipids on the characteristics of freeze-dried liposomes was investigated using hydroxypropyl-ß-cyclodextrin ( HP-ß-CD) as membrane protectant. The ethanol-injection method was applied to prepare liposomes using hydrogenated ( Phospholopion-90H and 80H) and non-hydrogenated phospholipids ( Lipoid-S100) in combination with cholesterol. Various liposomal formulations were tested: conventional liposomes ( CL) and HP-ß-CD-loaded liposomes ( CDL). Liposome suspensions were concentrated by ultracentrifugation; the pellets were reconstituted in water or CD solution and the dispersions were characterized for their size , polydispersity index and zeta potential. Results demonstrated that HP-ß-CD protected only the hydrogenated batches ( CL and CDL) during freeze-drying. Moreover , the presence of HP-ß-CD in the aqueous phase of CDL protected them during freeze-drying. Freeze-dried CL and CDL made of phospholipon-90H loading anethole were demonstrated to be physically stable upon reconstitution in HP-ß-CD solutions , and are able to retain anethole after 6 months of storage at 4 °C thereby making them valuable for food applications.
