 Mechanical ventilation ( MV) is an important procedure for the treatment of patients with acute lung injury or acute<pathogen><disease><symptom> respiratory distress syndrome<disease><symptom> in a clinical setting; however , MV can lead to severe complications , including ventilator-induced lung injury ( VILI). Telocytes ( TCs) can promote tissue repair following injury in the heart , kidneys , and other organs. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of TCs in VILI in mice and the associated mechanisms. By using in vivo studies in mice and in vitro studies in cells , we demonstrated that an airway injection of TCs can reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and improve the lung function in mice with VILI and promote the proliferation of pulmonary<disease> vascular endothelial cells. We also demonstrated that the impact of TCs on VILI repair might partially due to vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) secreted by TCs upon VILI stimulation , and that VEGF could induce the proliferation of hemangioendothelioma endothelial cells ( EOMA). Collectively , our results revealed novel functions of TCs in VILA repair and shed light on the complications that are caused by MV.
