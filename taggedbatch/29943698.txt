 Plants of the genus Campomanesia belong to the family Myrtaceae and are very abundant in Cerrado areas. Teas from leaves of species of this genus are used for intestinal infections , combating obesity , stomach pathology , fever<symptom> , among others. The present study evaluated the chemical composition and antioxidant potential , cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of ethanolic extract from leaves of Campomanesia pubescens ( Mart. ex DC.) O. Berg. For evaluation antioxidant activity , it was used the free radical DPPH and for determination of phenolic compounds was used Folin-Ciocalteau reagent. Identification of the substances was performed by HPLC-DAD by comparison of retention times with standards analyzed under the same conditions and by evaluation of molecular absorption spectra in the ultraviolet and visible region. The cytotoxicity , genotoxicity were evaluated using Allium cepa bioassay. In the ethanolic extract were identified 7-hydroxy-6-methyl-5-methoxyflavanone , 5,7-dihydroxy-6-methylflavanone , 5,7-dihydroxy-8-methylflavanone , 2 ' ,4 '- dihydroxy-6 '- methoxychalcone , 5,7-dihydroxy-6,8-dimethylflavanone , 2 ' ,4 '- dihydroxy-5 '- methyl-6 '- methoxychalcone and 2 ' ,4 '- dihydroxy-3 ' ,5 '- dimethyl-6 '- methoxychalcone. The extract showed antioxidant activity , cytotoxic effects on cell division and increased chromosomal alterations in Allium cepa test. These results showed antioxidant activity and suggest the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in Allium cepa of ethanolic extract obtained of leaves of Campomanesia pubescens.
