 Wallinia brasiliensis<pathogen> n. sp. is described from the intestine of two species of tetras-Astyanax fasciatus ( Cuvier , 1819) and Astyanax lacustris Lucena and Soares , 2016-collected from the Batalha River in São Paulo State , Brazil. The new species can be clearly distinguished from the other three congeneric species by its vitelline follicles extending from the genital pore to the end of the caeca , eggs lacking operculum , a larger egg size with a consequently lower number relative to the other three species , and the ovary located opposite the anterior testis. The validity of the new species was confirmed through a phylogenetic analysis of the 28S rRNA gene which showed that the new species is the sister taxon to Wallinia mexicana<pathogen> Pérez-Ponce de León , Razo-Mendivil , Mendoza-Garfía , Rubio-Godoy and Choudhury , 2015 , a species infecting Astyanax mexicanus ( De Filippi , 1853) in Mexico.
