 Urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( UTI) is the second most frequent infection in human , and uropathogenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> is its most common cause. Although antibiotics are the standard treatment for UTI , they can cause harmful effects on gut microbiome and increase the rate of existing drug-resistant bacteria , which make the vaccine research reasonable. This study was conducted to construct a Killed but Metabolically Active ( KBMA) E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strain , and to determine its characteristics as a possible vaccine candidate for UTI , which will be evaluated in further investigations. The uvrB gene of uvrABC excision repair system of E.coli was deleted to construct a ΔuvrB mutant , lacking repairing system of intercross linkages between DNA strands. To construct KBMA strain , the ΔuvrB mutant was PUVA-treated , using different doses of 8-methoxypsoralen ( 8-MOP) followed by different doses of ultraviolet A ( UVA) irradiation ( 365 nm) , until the optimal doses of each were achieved. Then , different characteristics of the PUVA-treated E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( with the optimal doses) were assessed , using cell counting , colony formation assay , MTT and XTT assays , fluorescent staining , and flow cytometry. PUVA treatment 's optimal dose for E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates was 150 ng/ml 8-MOP plus 1000 mj/cm These PUVA-treated bacteria , with metabolic activity and proliferation inability , seem to be good enough to be tested in vitro and in vivo as a candidate for vaccine against UTI. Therefore it seems the first step toward development of a vaccine candidate is successfully done. The immunogenicity and protectivity of these treated bacteria is under evaluation.
