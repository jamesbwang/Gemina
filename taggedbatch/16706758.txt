 Fat grafting has become popular since the first report of structural fat grafting in 2001. Fat grafting is effective not only for volume augmentation but also for tissue revitalization. However , fat harvesting is necessary before fat grafting can be performed. Therefore , the performance of serial fat injections is very challenging when treating such patients. From August 2015 to March 2017 , we investigated 219 patients who underwent fat grafting using the fat that had already been cryopreserved at -196 °C. Follow-up ranged from 3 months to 2 years. No complications occurred , and all outcomes were satisfactory. Three representative cases were also reviewed. The cryopreserved fat at -196 °C could be served as a useful method for serial fat grafting for clinical use; however , further research involving longer follow-up and pathological findings are needed.
