 Photoreceptors have high intrinsic metabolic demand and are exquisitely sensitive to metabolic perturbation. In addition , they shed a large portion of their outer segment lipid membranes<symptom> in a circadian manner , increasing the metabolic burden on the outer retina associated with the re-synthesis of cell membranes<symptom> and disposal of the cellular cargo. Here we demonstrate that deletion of both ABCA1 and ABCG1 in rod photoreceptors leads to age-related accumulation of cholesterol metabolites in the outer retina , photoreceptor dysfunction , degeneration of rod outer segments , and ultimately blindness<symptom>. A high fat diet ( HFD) significantly accelerates rod neurodegeneration and vision loss<symptom> , further highlighting the role of lipid homeostasis in regulating photoreceptor neurodegeneration and vision.
