 Hostile behaviour by mental health care users ( MHCUs) is prevalent in forensic units in South Africa , and this causes service providers distress and burnout. Psychiatric nurses ( PNs) find it difficult to render quality care to MHCUs who are threatening them and also challenging their authority in a forensic unit. Forensic mental health care practitioners may be challenged to engage authentically with MHCUs who constitute a risk to their personal safety or who have committed acts the practitioner finds morally disturbing. There is a need to facilitate the mental health of PNs in a forensic unit to manage hostile behaviour constructively. The objective of this article is to describe the process that was followed in developing , implementing and evaluating a model that could be used as a framework of reference to facilitate the mental health of PNs in a forensic unit to manage hostile behaviour constructively. A theory-generative , qualitative , exploratory descriptive and contextual study design was used to develop the model. The steps of the process entailed the identification of the central concept , the definition of the central concept and other essential criteria and the classification of the central and related concepts. The model was then described and evaluated. The central concept was identified as the ` facilitation of empowerment of PNs to manage hostility in a constructive manner ' , defined , classified and then described and evaluated. The model as framework of reference could assist PNs in managing hostility in a forensic unit constructively.
