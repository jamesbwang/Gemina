 Advances in healthcare technology for continence have historically been limited compared to other areas of medicine , reflecting the complexities of the condition and social stigma which act as a barrier to participation. This whitepaper has been developed to inspire and direct the engineering science community towards research opportunities that exist for continence technologies that address unmet needs in diagnosis , treatment and long-term management. Our aim is to pinpoint key challenges and highlight related research opportunities for novel technological advances. To do so , we draw on experience and expertise from academics , clinicians , patients and patient groups linked to continence healthcare. This is presented in four areas of consideration: the clinical pathway , patient perspective , research challenges and effective innovation. In each we introduce seminal research , background information and demonstrative case-studies , before discussing their relevance to engineering science researchers who are interested in approaching this overlooked but vital area of healthcare.
