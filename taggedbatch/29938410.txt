 Tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> , among human bacterial infections is very important disease of modern world and disease has forensic importance. Extra pulmonary<disease> infection<disease> is also very common. Histopathology of effected tissue is an important diagnostic modality. Demonstration of mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> in granulomas<disease> is necessary for definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis<disease> , as many different granulomatous diseases may mimic tuberculosis<disease>. Study was conducted to see the positivity of mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> Tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> in tuberculous lymphadenitis<disease><symptom> and comparative difference in two stains. A correctional study on tuberculosis<disease> was performed in PGMI Lahore in collaboration with pathology department Ayub medical college Abbottabad. Fifty cases of formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue block previously diagnosed as tuberculous lymphadenitis<disease><symptom> on histopathology were selected. Three-micron thick section were taken and stained with Zn stain and Auramin/ Rhodamin stain. The results were compared; statistical analysis was done using 2 Ã— 2 table. Out of 33 ( 66 %) female and 17 ( 34 %) male patients ranging from 9-80 years 9 ( 18 %) were positive for Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> Tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> with Zn stain and 21 ( 42 %) were positive in Auramine/ Rhodamine staining procedure. Auramine/ Rhodamine staining procedure was superior to Zn staining method for tissue staining of Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> Tuberculosis<pathogen><disease>.
