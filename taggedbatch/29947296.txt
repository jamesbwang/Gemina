 Here we report a new ambiguous continuous motion display , in which two objects appear at the diagonally opposite corners of an imaginary square , move along the diagonal axis toward each other , and after meeting in the center , shift their trajectories to the other two diagonal corners. This display can be seen as two objects ' colliding and bouncing off each other , with two competing interpretations of trajectory configuration requiring either vertical or horizontal integration of trajectory segments. Despite the fact that both percepts are equally plausible , the current study revealed a perceptual preference toward a vertical integration interpretation. We compared this bias with the similar vertical bias in a bistable apparent motion quartet , which suggests that the directional anisotropy found here is quite a new , and distinct phenomenon in both its perceptual characteristics and underlying mechanism.
