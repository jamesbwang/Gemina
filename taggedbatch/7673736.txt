 Interleukin ( IL) -4 and IL-13 are related cytokines that regulate many aspects of allergic inflammation<symptom>. They play important roles in regulating the responses of lymphocytes , myeloid cells , and non-hematopoietic cells. In T-cells , IL-4 induces the differentiation of na√Øve CD4 T cells into Th2 cells , in B cells , IL-4 drives the immunoglobulin ( Ig) class switch to IgG1 and IgE , and in macrophages , IL-4 and IL-13 induce alternative macrophage activation. This review gives a short insight into the functional formation of these cytokine receptors. I will discuss both the binding kinetics of ligand/receptor interactions and the expression of the receptor chains for these cytokines in various cell types; both of which are crucial factors in explaining the efficiency by which these cytokines induce intracellular signaling and gene expression. Work initiated in part by William ( Bill) E. Paul on IL-4 some 30 years ago has now grown into a major building block of our current understanding of basic immunology and the immune response. This knowledge on IL-4 has growing clinical importance , as therapeutic approaches targeting the cytokine and its signal transduction are becoming a part of the clinical practice in treating allergic diseases. Just by reading the reference list of this short review , one can appreciate the enormous input Bill has had on shaping our understanding of the pathophysiology of allergic inflammation<symptom> and in particular the role of IL-4 in this process.
