 A few studies have compared auscultation and oscillometric devices with the mercury sphygmomanometer ( MS) reference values for blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) measurement in an epidemiologic survey.Four trained observers recorded BP measurements from 766 subjects from general Korean population in 2014 and 2015. Measurements were repeated 3 times for each device , alternately using an MS and 2 electronic devices ( EDs; Greenlight 300 vs Omron HEM-907) , together with a randomized device sequence. The BP measurement difference was defined as BP measured by MS minus BP obtained by ED , and the absolute error as the absolute value of the difference.Mean differences in systolic BP ( SBP) were -0.52 and -0.62 mmHg and those of diastolic BP ( DBP) were -0.78 and 6.23 mmHg ( P < .01) in the Greenlight and Omron device group , respectively. The concordance correlation coefficients were 0.97 and 0.94 for SBP and 0.95 and 0.76 for DBP in the Greenlight and Omron group , respectively ( P < .05). Kappa values for the Joint National Committee 7 BP classification were 0.84 and 0.74 for Greenlight and Omron group , respectively. The prevalence of normotension , prehypertension and hypertension were 53.5 % , 33.9 % , and 12.5 % with the MS and 59.8 % , 29.0 % , and 11.2 % with the ED in the Omron group ( P = .03 , McNemar test) , whereas they were insignificant in the Greenlight group.The Greenlight 300 may be a good alternative to the MS , and the Omron HEM-907 has good accuracy in SBP measurement. Due to the measurement error in DBP , Omron HEM-907 was inferior to the Greenlight device.
