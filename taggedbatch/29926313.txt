 In the early stage of acute pancreatitis<disease> ( AP) , abundant cytokines induced by local pancreatic inflammation<symptom> enter the bloodstream , further cause systemic inflammatory response syndrome<disease><symptom> ( SIRS) by `` trigger effect '' , which eventually leads to multiple<symptom> organ dysfunction syndrome<disease><symptom> ( MODS). During SIRS and MODS , the intestinal barrier function was seriously damaged accompanied by the occurrence of gut-derived infection which forms a `` second hit summit '' by inflammatory overabundance. Gastrointestinal microecology , namely the biologic barrier , could be transformed into a pathogenic state , which is called microflora dysbiosis when interfered by the inflammatory stress during AP. More and more evidences indicate that gastrointestinal microflora dysbiosis plays a key role in `` the second hit '' induced by AP gut-derived infection. Therefore , the maintenance of gastrointestinal microecology balance<symptom> is likely to provide an effective method in modulating systemic<disease> infection<disease> of AP. This article reviewed the progress of gastrointestinal microecology in AP to provide a reference for deeply understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of AP and identifying new therapeutic targets.
