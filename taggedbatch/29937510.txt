 Earthquake disaster insurance can effectively reduce the impact of earthquake disasters on rural households. Exploring rural households & rsquo; willingness to purchase earthquake disaster insurance in earthquake disaster areas provides an understanding of the motivations underlying the implementation of an insurance policy. However , few studies have examined the perspectives of rural households , in order to explore the correlations between the rural households & rsquo; livelihood capital , their disaster risk perception , and their willingness to purchase earthquake disaster insurance. A cross-sectional survey data including 241 rural households from the most severe disaster counties ( cities) during the 5 & bull; 12 Wenchuan earthquake was examined with regard to rural households & rsquo; livelihood and disaster risk perception , and ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to explore rural households & rsquo; willingness to purchase earthquake disaster insurance , as well as the driving mechanism behind this willingness. The results showed that 34.44 % of rural households were very willing to purchase earthquake disaster insurance , and 7.05 % of rural households were very reluctant to purchase earthquake insurance. Rural households & rsquo; livelihood capital and risk perceptions were the most important factors affecting their willingness to purchase earthquake disaster insurance. Rural households with higher scores on natural capital , physical capital , possibility , and worry were more likely to purchase earthquake disaster insurance. Specifically , keeping all other variables constant , every one unit increase in nature capital and physical capital corresponded to an increase in the odds of willingness to purchase earthquake disaster insurance by a factor of 0.14 and 0.06 , respectively; every one unit increase in possibility and worry corresponded to an increase in the odds of willingness to purchase earthquake disaster insurance by a factor of 0.03 and 0.04 , respectively. This study contributes to the current literature by increasing the understanding of the relationships between Chinese rural households & rsquo; livelihood capital and risk perceptions , and their willingness to purchase earthquake disaster insurance.
