 Understanding antibody repertoires and in particular , the properties and fates of B cells expressing potentially pathogenic antibodies is critical to define the mechanisms underlying multiple immunological diseases including autoimmune and allergic conditions as well as transplant rejection. Moreover , an integrated knowledge of the antibody repertoires expressed by B cells and plasma cells ( PC) of different functional properties and longevity is essential to develop new therapeutic strategies , better biomarkers for disease segmentation , and new assays to measure restoration of B-cell tolerance or , at least , of normal B-cell homeostasis. Reaching these goals , however , will require a more precise phenotypic , functional and molecular definition of B-cell and PC populations , and a comprehensive analysis of the antigenic reactivity of the antibodies they express. While traditionally hampered by technical and ethical limitations in human experimentation , new technological advances currently enable investigators to address these questions in a comprehensive fashion. In this review , we shall discuss these concepts as they apply to the study of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
