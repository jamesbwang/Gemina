 In this prospective , randomized , placebo-controlled study , the authors compared the analgesic efficacy of the single-shot adductor canal block ( SS-ACB) vs the continuous adductor canal block ( C-ACB) with intermittent boluses during the 72-hour postoperative period. Seventy-five patients randomly received the following: a single shot of 20 mL of 0.5 % ropivacaine preoperatively followed by intermittent saline boluses at 12 hours and 24 hours postoperatively ( SS-ACB group); 20 mL of 0.5 % ropivacaine preoperatively and 12 hours and 24 hours postoperatively ( C-ACB group); or saline preoperatively and postoperatively ( control group). The primary outcome was visual analog scale pain scores with movement on postoperative day 1. The dynamic pain scores of the 2 ACB groups were equivalent and were lower than those of the control group on postoperative day 1. Compared with the control group , the 2 ACB groups were less likely to use opioids on the operative day and the first 2 postoperative days. The patients in the control group and the C-ACB group exhibited less quadriceps muscle strength than those in the SS-ACB group on postoperative day 1. The time required for an SS-ACB was markedly shorter than that required for an indwelling adductor canal catheter. Further , each adductor canal catheter cost $ 80. Patients who received a single block reported more satisfaction with their pain-relief treatment. Given the similar analgesic effect but better quadriceps muscle strength , easier execution , and higher patient satisfaction , the SS-ACB may be more suitable for total knee arthroplasty patients than the C-ACB.
