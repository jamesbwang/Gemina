 DNA methylation at the 5-position of cytosine is an epigenetic modification of CpG dinucleotides. In addition to CpG methylation , the G-quadruplex ( G4) structure has been reported as a regulator of gene expression. The identification of G4 forming sequences in CpG islands suggests an involvement of CpG-methylated G4 structures in biological processes; however , few reports have addressed the effects of CpG methylation on G4 structure. The thermostability of a methylated , 21-mer G4 structure located on the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) gene promoter containing four CpG sites ( C1 , C6 , C11 , and C17) were investigated using circular dichroism ( CD) spectral analysis. CD melting analysis revealed that VEGF G4 was stabilized by a single CpG methylation on C11 in the presence of Na Single CpG methylation appears to enhance VEGF G4 thermostability in a manner dependent on both the CpG methylation site and cation type. These results are expected to contribute to the elucidation of the roles of CpG methylation-stabilized G4 structures in biological processes.
