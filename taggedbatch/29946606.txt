 It is shown that water-in-oil microemulsions ( m/e or Î¼E) can produce BaCeO3 ( BCO) and LaCoO3 ( LCO) precursors. The nanoparticles ( NPs) adsorb on AlOOH sols , in much the same way as Turkevich previously immobilised platinum group metal sols. BCO is active in CO and propane oxidation and NO removal under stoichiometric exhaust conditions , but LCO is a better oxidation catalyst. Activity was also seen when Ba , Ce and La , Co are inserted into/segregate at the surface of AlOOH/Al2O3. However , there is only formation of low levels of BCO , CAIO3 ( CAO) , LCO and LaAIO3 ( LAO) perovskites , along with aluminates and separate oxides. The complexing of cations by AlOOH surface-held oxalate ions , albeit with different efficiencies , has also been explored. All three routes yield active catalysts with micro-domains of crystallinity; microemulsions produce the best defined perovskite NPs , but even those from surface segregation have higher turnover numbers than traditional Pt catalysts. Perovskite NPs may open up green chemistry for air pollution control that is consistent with a circular economy.
