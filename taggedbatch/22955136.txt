 Modeling and simulations were used to support body weight-based dose selection for eslicarbazepine acetate ( ESL) in pediatric subjects aged 4-17 years with partial-onset seizures<symptom>. A one-compartment pediatric population pharmacokinetic model with formulation-specific first-order absorption , first-order elimination , and weight-based allometric scaling of clearance and distribution volume was developed with PK data from subjects 2-18 years of age treated with ESL 5-30 mg/kg/day. Covariate analysis was performed to quantify the effects of key demographic and clinical covariates ( including body<symptom> weight and concomitant use of carbamazepine , levetiracetam , and phenobarbital-like antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs)) on variability in PK parameters. Model evaluation performed using a simulation-based visual predictive check and a non-parametric bootstrap procedure indicated no substantial bias in the overall model and in the accuracy of estimates. The model estimated that concomitant use of carbamazepine or phenobarbital-like AEDs with ESL would decrease the exposure of eslicarbazepine , and that concomitant use of levetiracetam with ESL would increase the exposure of eslicarbazepine , although the small effect of levetiracetam may not represent a true difference. Model-based simulations were subsequently performed to apply target exposure matching of selected ESL doses for pediatric subjects ( aged 4-17 years) to attain eslicarbazepine exposures associated with effective and well-tolerated ESL doses in adults. Overall , model-based exposure matching allowed for extrapolation of efficacy to support pediatric dose selection as part of the submission to obtain FDA approval for ESL ( adjunctive therapy and monotherapy) in subjects aged 4-17 years , without requiring an additional clinical study.
