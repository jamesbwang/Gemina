 Dr. David Price and his colleagues , in their article in this issue of Academic Medicine , summarize the findings from recent studies regarding the association of Maintenance of Certification and physicians ' learning and improvements in care. Their evaluation demonstrates that physicians often changed their practice because of these educational interventions. In this Invited Commentary , the author argues that , although this finding is reassuring , it is the right answer to the wrong question. The critical questions the profession faces are whether physicians have the humility to routinely submit themselves to the judgment of their peers , whether they will accept responsibility for managing their professional competence and that of their colleagues , and whether they are willing to create a process for identifying and remediating underperforming clinicians.If certifying boards assume responsibility for this system of accountability , then each would need to set the competency expectations for physicians in its specialty areas , allow clinicians to self-identify their core scope of practice , assume responsibility for summative assessment , provide formative feedback to participants , and link physicians to recommended professional development activities. Continuing certification must be sensitive to the burdens it puts on physicians and recognize engagement in a spectrum of learning activities that are integrated with daily practice , including continuing medical education. By assuming responsibility for their own continuing competency and that of their colleagues , physicians can manifest their commitment to their patients and their profession.
