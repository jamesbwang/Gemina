 The combination of well-defined acid sites , shape-selective properties and outstanding stability places zeolites among the most practically relevant heterogeneous catalysts. The development of structure-performance descriptors for processes that they catalyse has been a matter of intense debate , both in industry and academia , and the direct conversion of methanol to olefins is a prototypical system in which various catalytic functions contribute to the overall performance. Propylene selectivity and resistance to coking are the two most important parameters in developing new methanol-to-olefin catalysts. Here , we present a systematic investigation on the effect of acidity on the performance of the zeolite ` ZSM-5 ' for the production of propylene. Our results demonstrate that the isolation of Br√∏nsted acid sites is key to the selective formation of propylene. Also , the introduction of Lewis acid sites prevents the formation of coke , hence drastically increasing catalyst lifetime.
