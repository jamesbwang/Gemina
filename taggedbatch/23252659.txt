 A 42-year-old male presented to us after an episode of acute anterior human leukocyte antigen ( HLA)- B27-associated uveitis , and intraocular pressure ( IOP) in the right eye was 4 mmHg. Ultrasound biomicroscopy revealed ciliary body edema<symptom> with supraciliary effusion<symptom>. He was on a frequent topical corticosteroid , and oral steroid in addition to receiving a periocular injection depot corticosteroid 20 days back. He was started on treatment with subcutaneous golimumab ( GLM). After a month , his IOP in the right eye was 14 mm of Hg with UBM showing resolution of ciliary body edema<symptom>. GLM can be useful in the management of steroid-resistant cases of HLA B-27-associated ocular hypotony.
