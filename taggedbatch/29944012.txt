 This study examined whether pursuing intrinsic versus extrinsic goals was associated with distinct motivational processes in eating regulation and with healthy versus unhealthy eating. Path analysis demonstrated that appearance goals were associated with fat talk , whereas health goals were associated with self-compassion. Fat talk was positively associated with non-self-determined motivation and unhealthy eating , whereas self-compassion was positively associated with self-determined motivation and healthy eating , and negatively associated with unhealthy eating. Findings emphasize the negative effects of pursuing appearance goals and engaging in fat talk and the benefits of pursuing health goals and being self-compassionate.
