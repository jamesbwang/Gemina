 Ovarian theca cell hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS is compounded by androgen receptor-mediated impairment of estradiol and progesterone negative feedback regulation of episodic LH release. The resultant LH hypersecretion , likely the product of accelerated episodic release of GnRH from the median eminence of the hypothalamus , hyperstimulates ovarian theca cell steroidogenesis , enabling testosterone ( T) and androstenedione excess. Prenatally androgenized female monkeys ( PA) exposed to fetal male levels of T during early-to-mid gestation , when adult , demonstrate PCOS-like traits , including high T and LH levels. This study tests the hypothesis that progesterone resistance-associated acceleration in episodic LH release contributes to PA monkey LH excess. 4 PA and 3 regularly cycling , healthy control adult female rhesus monkeys of comparable age and body mass index underwent ( 1) a 10 h , frequent intravenous sampling assessment for LH episodic release , immediately followed by ( 2) IV infusion of exogenous GnRH to quantify continuing pituitary LH responsiveness , and subsequently ( 3) an SC injection of a progesterone receptor antagonist , mifepristone , to examine LH responses to blockade of progesterone-mediated action. Compared to controls , the relatively hyperandrogenic PA females exhibited ~ 100 % increase ( p = 0.037) in LH pulse frequency , positive correlation of LH pulse amplitude ( p = 0.017) with androstenedione , ~ 100 % greater increase ( p = 0.034) in acute ( 0-- 10 min) LH responses to exogenous GnRH , and an absence ( p = 0.008) of modest LH elevation following acute progesterone receptor blockade suggestive of diminished progesterone negative feedback. Such dysregulation of LH release in PCOS-like monkeys implicates impaired feedback control of episodic release of hypothalamic GnRH reminiscent of PCOS neuroendocrinopathy.
