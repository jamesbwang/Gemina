 Antiplatelet therapy is a cornerstone prevention strategy for secondary ischemic stroke ( IS) and transient ischemic attack ( TIA). Yet , a proportion of patients who receive antiplatelet therapy experience recurrent ischemic cerebrovascular events. A recent meta-analysis found an increased risk of recurrent stroke in clopidogrel- or aspirin-treated patients with ischemic stroke who had high on-treatment platelet reactivity ( HTPR). Few studies have focused specifically on clopidogrel HTPR. Therefore , the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between clopidogrel HTPR and recurrent ischemic events in a population of Danish patients with IS. We performed a prospective observational study to evaluate the relationship between HTPR defined as platelet reaction units > 208 and a composite primary endpoint of recurrent stroke , TIA , acute myocardial infarction ( AMI) , or vascular death over a 2-year follow-up period. A total of 142 patients were included in the final statistical analysis , but only 3 patients ( 2.1 %) demonstrated clopidogrel HTPR. The median time of on-treatment platelet testing was 75 days. Recurrent IS , TIA , AMI , or vascular death occurred in 14 patients ( 10 %). Of these , 1 new ischemic event ( AMI) occurred in a HTPR patient. There was no difference in the frequency of new ischemic events between the HTPR and non-HTPR groups ( P = .27); moreover , the number of patients with HTPR was too small for statistical analysis. Clopidogrel HTPR does not seem to be a major contributor to recurrent ischemic events in Danish ischemic stroke patients.
