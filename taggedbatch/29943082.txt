 Knowledge about the mechanisms underlying canine vision is far from being exhaustive , especially that concerning post-retinal elaboration. One aspect that has received little attention is motion perception , and in spite of the common belief that dogs are extremely apt at detecting moving stimuli , there is no scientific support for such an assumption. In fact , we recently showed that dogs have higher thresholds than humans for coherent motion detection ( Kanizsar et al. in Sci Rep UK 7:11259 , 2017). This term refers to the ability of the visual system to perceive several units moving in the same direction , as one coherently moving global unit. Coherent motion perception is commonly investigated using random dot displays , containing variable proportions of coherently moving dots. Here , we investigated the relative contribution of local and global integration mechanisms for coherent motion perception , and changes in detection thresholds as a result of repeated exposure to the experimental stimuli. Dogs who had been involved in the previous study were given a conditioned discrimination task , in which we systematically manipulated dot density and duration and , eventually , re-assessed our subjects ' threshold after extensive exposure to the stimuli. Decreasing dot duration impacted on dogs ' accuracy in detecting coherent motion only at very low duration values , revealing the efficacy of local integration mechanisms. Density impacted on dogs ' accuracy in a linear fashion , indicating less efficient global integration. There was limited evidence of improvement in the re-assessment but , with an average threshold at re-assessment of 29 % , dogs ' ability to detect coherent motion remains much poorer than that of humans.
