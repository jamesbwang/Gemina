J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-Official international tournaments in which youth soccer players participate can involve very congested schedules. Yet , no information regarding physical and technical match performance during congested vs. regular ( noncongested) cycles is available. In this study , accelerations , decelerations , mean metabolic power ( MP) , and technical performance ( offensive and defensive variables) were compared across very congested match ( VCM; 10 international matches played over 3 successive days , including 2 days with 2 consecutive matches separated by a 4- to 5-hour interval) and 10 regular ( noncongested match ( NCM)) match periods in elite male Under 15 ( U15 , n = 11) and Under 17 ( U17 , n = 13) soccer players. Players wore a 15-Hz Global Positioning System unit with a 100-Hz triaxial accelerometer. The session rating of perceived exertion ( RPE) were assessed 30 minutes after match. Results showed a higher number of accelerations per minute observed in VCM vs. NCM ( U15; 2.27 ± 0.35 vs. 2.12 ± 0.23; effect size ( ES) = 0.49; U17; 2.27 ± 0.41 vs. 2.01 ± 0.31; ES = 0.69). Decelerations per minute were higher during VCM ( U15; 1.99 ± 0.27 vs. 1.84 ± 0.25; ES = 0.55; and U17; 1.98 ± 0.35 vs. 1.80 ± 0.27; ES = 0.56). Mean MP was higher in the VCM ( U15; 0.42 ± 0.06 vs. 0.37 ± 0.02; ES = 1.08; U17; 0.46 ± 0.03 vs. 0.30 ± 0.03; ES = 1.94). Technical actions per minute were higher in the VCM for U17 ( ES = 1.60 and 1.37 , for offensive and defensive performance , respectively) but lower ( during VCM) for U15 ( ES = 3.59 and 0.28 , for offensive and defensive performance). U15 reported a higher session RPE in the VCM ( 7.9 ± 0.5 AUs vs. 6.9 ± 0.5 AUs). The findings suggest that running activity in these youth players was unaffected overall in tournaments with congested schedules , and that the intensity of match-play was actually greater than in regular match schedules.
