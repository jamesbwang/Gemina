 We conducted an in silico analysis to search for important genes in the pathogenesis of Caseous<disease> Lymphadenitis<disease><symptom> ( CL) , with prospects for use in formulating effective vaccines against this disease. For this , we performed a survey of proteins expressed by Corynebacterium<pathogen> pseudotuberculosis<pathogen> , using protein sequences collected from the NCBI GenPept database and the keywords `` caseous<disease> lymphadenitis<disease><symptom> '' and `` Corynebacterium<pathogen><pathogen> pseudotuberculosis<pathogen> '' and `` goats ''. A network was developed using the STRING 10 database , with a confidence score of 0.900. For every gene interaction identified , we summed the interaction score of each gene , generating a combined association score to obtain a single score named weighted number of links ( WNL). Genes with the highest WNL were named `` leader genes ''. Ontological analysis was extracted from the STRING database through Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG) database. A search in the GenPept database revealed 2,124 proteins. By using and plotting with STRING 10 , we then developed an in silico network model comprised of 1,243 genes/proteins interconnecting through 3,330 interactions. The highest WNL values were identified in the rplB gene , which was named the leader gene. Our ontological analysis shows that this protein acts effectively mainly on Metabolic pathways and Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. In conclusion , the in silico analyses showed that rplB has good potential for vaccine development. However , functional assays are needed to make sure that this protein can potentially induce both humoral and cellular immune responses against C.<pathogen> pseudotuberculosis<pathogen> in goats.
