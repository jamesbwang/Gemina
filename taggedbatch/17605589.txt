 Pro-social behaviors have been adequately studied by neuroscientists. However , few neural studies have focused on the social evaluation of pro-social behaviors , and none has compared the neural correlates of different pro-social decision evaluations. By fourth-party evaluation of third-party punishment/help dictator game paradigm , we explored the third-party pro-social behaviors and derived feedback-related negativity ( FRN) from the electroencephalogram. Different from previous event-related potentials ( ERP) studies , we simultaneously focused on two different third-party pro-social behaviors , which were called third-party help and third-party punishment. For the first time , we compared the different neural processes of fourth-party evaluation on third-party help and punishment. Behavioral results showed that fourth-party bystanders appreciated the help behavior of the third party even more than the punishment behavior. ERP results revealed that fourth-party bystanders ' FRN amplitudes were modulated by the third-party behaviors. Under the assignment condition ( 70:30) with help/punishment magnitude 45 and ( 90:10) with magnitude 80 , the third-party help elicited a larger FRN than third-party punishment; whereas under the condition ( 90:10) with help/punishment magnitude 45 , the difference between FRN amplitudes disappeared. These results indicated that fourth-party bystanders ultimately agreed more with helpful third parties; however , after they witnessed the norm violation , they expected the third parties to punish the norm violators immediately. This phenomenon appears only when the third-party actors can achieve justice between norm violators and victims.
