 As well-known persistent organic pollutants ( POPs) , organofluorine pollutants such as perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS) have been proven to be bioaccumulated and harmful to health. However , toxicological assessment of organofluorinated nanoparticles , which have emerged as a novel tool for biomedical and industrial applications , is lacking , to the best of our knowledge. To assess the biological effects and health risk of fluorinated nanoparticles , trifluoroethyl aryl ether-based fluorinated poly ( methyl methacrylate) nanoparticles ( PTFE-PMMA NPs) were synthesized with various fluorine contents ( PTFE-PMMA-1 NPs 12.0 wt. % , PTFE-PMMA-2 NPs 6.1 wt. % and PTFE-PMMA-3 NPs 5.0 wt. %) , and their cytotoxicity was investigated in this study. The in vitro experimental results indicated that the cytotoxicity of PTFE-PMMA NPs was mild , and was closely related to their fluorine ( F) contents and F-containing side chains. Specifically , the cytotoxicity of PTFE-PMMA NPs decreased with increasing F content and F-containing side chains. After exposure to PTFE-PMMA NPs at a sublethal dose ( 50Î¼g/mL) for 24 hr , the phospholipid bilayer was damaged , accompanied by increasing permeability of the cell membrane. Meanwhile , the intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) occurred , resulting in the increase of DNA damage , cell cycle arrest and cell death. Overall , the PTFE-PMMA NPs were found to be relatively safe compared with typical engineered nanomaterials ( ENMs) , such as silver nanoparticles and graphene oxide , for biomedical and industrial applications.
