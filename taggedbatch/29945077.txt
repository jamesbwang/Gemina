 Given the increasing prevalence of natural disasters , trauma-informed school settings should include efficient methods for assessing child health and mental health in post-disaster environments. To develop such methods , factors that contribute to children 's vulnerability and key signs of distress reactions after disasters need to be understood. To address these issues , we evaluated pre-disaster community violence exposure as a vulnerability factor for children 's post-disaster reactions and somatic symptoms as a key post-disaster outcome. We evaluated 426 children exposed to Hurricane Katrina at two timepoints ( 3-7 months and 13-17 months post-disaster). Structural equation models evaluated community violence exposure , hurricane exposure , and posttraumatic stress and somatic symptoms. Community violence exposure was associated with increased levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms among disaster-impacted youth , and did not moderate the relationship between disaster exposure and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were associated with somatic symptoms in the short-term recovery period ( 3-7 months) , but not associated with somatic symptoms during the longer-term recovery period ( 13-17 months). This study did not include school-level factors , and somatic symptoms were based on parent reports. The study did not include parent functioning information or distinguish between whether somatic symptoms were medical or functional in nature. Post-disaster school-based screeners may need to incorporate questions related to children 's past exposure to community violence and their somatic symptoms to provide trauma-informed care for children.
