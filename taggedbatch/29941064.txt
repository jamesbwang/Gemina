 Salmonella<pathogen><disease> Give is a rare serotype across Europe. In October 2016 , a national outbreak of S. Give occurred in Malta. We describe the epidemiological , environmental , microbiological and veterinary investigations. Whole-genome sequencing ( WGS) was performed on human , food , environmental and veterinary isolates. Thirty-six human cases were reported between October and November 2016 , 10 ( 28 %) of whom required hospitalisation. Twenty-six ( 72 %) cases were linked to four restaurants. S. Give was isolated from ready-to-eat antipasti served by three restaurants which were all supplied by the same local food manufacturer. Food-trace-back investigations identified S. Give in packaged bean dips , ham , pork and an asymptomatic food handler at the manufacturer; inspections found inadequate separation between raw and ready-to-eat food during processing. WGS indicated two genetically distinguishable strains of S. Give with two distinct clusters identified; one cluster linked to the local food manufacturer and a second linked to veterinary samples. Epidemiological , environmental and WGS evidence pointed towards cross-contamination of raw and ready-to-eat foods at the local manufacturer as the likely source of one cluster. Severity of illness indicates a high virulence of this specific serotype. To prevent future cases and outbreaks , adherence to food safety practices at manufacturing level need to be reinforced.
