 The Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA) is one of the most common screening instruments for mild cognitive impairment. However , the standard MoCA is approximately two times longer to administer than the Mini-Mental State Examination. A total of 699 Czech and 175 American participants received the standard MoCA Czech and English versions and in the clinical part , a sample of 102 nondemented patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD). We created a validated Czech short version ( s-MoCA-CZ) from the original using item response theory. As expected , s-MoCA-CZ scores were highly correlated with the standard version ( Pearson r = .94 , p < .001). s-MoCA-CZ also had 80 % classification accuracy in the differentiation of PD mild cognitive impairment from PD without impairment. The s-MoCA-CZ , a brief screening tool , is shorter to administer than the standard MoCA. It provides high-classification accuracy for PD mild cognitive impairment and is equivalent to that of the standard MoCA-CZ.
