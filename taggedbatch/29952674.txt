 To examine the measurement properties of an adductor strength assessment system in professional Australian footballers. Observational , longitudinal design. Test-retest reliability data were collected from 18 professional Australian footballers from one club on the same day during the 2017 AFL competition. Week-to-week variation data were collected on 45 professional Australian footballers from one club during the same season at 48 , 72 and 120 h post-match ( rounds 1-23). Players lay beneath a GroinBar Hip Strength Testing System in supine position with their knee joint at an angle of 60 degrees. Force ( N) was extracted for left and right limbs of each player and a pain score from 0-10 ( 0 = no pain , 10 = maximum pain) was provided. Coefficient of variation ( CV) and smallest worthwhile change ( SWC) were calculated on test-retest data. Signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR) was calculated for each major time point. Mean difference between force scores in a subgroup of players with and without groin pain ( n = 18) were collected as evidence of construct validity for the system. Test CV was 6.3 % ( 4.9 , 9.0). CV exceeded the SWC on both limbs. Intraclass coefficient ( ICC) was 0.94. SNR ranged from 1.6 and 2.6 on average for 48 , 72 and 120 h post-match. Groin pain had a very likely moderate negative effect on adductor strength ( ES: 0.41). The system possesses greater measurement precision to dynamometry and sphygmomanometer adductor strength assessment methods in professional Australian footballers. Increased groin pain reduced groin squeeze force production. Practitioners may interpret changes exceeding 6.3 % in adductor strength as real.
