 Inflammatory breast cancer ( IBC) is a rare subtype of breast cancer , accounting for 8-10 % of breast cancer-associated deaths in the US. Clinical hallmarks of IBC include tumor emboli in lymphatic vessels and E-cadherin overexpression , which supports a type of metastasis referred to as cell cluster-based metastasis , prevalent in IBC. In contrast , we previously reported epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT)- based progression of IBC , utilizing in vivo xenografts and in vitro Matrigel culture models. To address these two contradictory concepts of IBC metastasis , we used Matrigel culture to induce EMT in a panel of IBC cells. Results revealed Matrigel culture induced vimentin expression in SUM149 and SUM190 IBC cells at the transcriptional and protein levels while maintaining the expression of E-cadherin , a phenomenon referred to as partial EMT. Transcriptional profiling revealed that expression of colony-stimulating factor 1 ( CSF-1) was induced in Matrigel culture. When the receptor tyrosine kinase of CSF-1 ( CSF-1R) was inhibited by CSF-1R inhibitor BLZ945 , the partial EMT was reversed in a dose-dependent manner , indicating that the CSF-1/ CSF-1R axis plays a key role in controlling partial EMT. This observation may help reconcile the two contradictory theories of IBC metastasis , EMT vs cell cluster-based metastasis.
