 Extensive burn may cause acute resistance to insulin , which accentuates hypermetabolism , impairs glucose metabolism , immune dysfunction and risks of sepsis<disease>. To minimize these effects , insulin is used as a treatment. The purpose was to analyze the collagen-elastic arrangement effects of insulin on the burned skin. Wistar rats were assigned in groups: control ( C); control with insulin ( C + I); scald burn injury ( SBI); and SBI with insulin ( SBI + I). SBI were submitted to 45 % total body surface area burn and the insulin-treated groups received insulin ( 5 UI/Kg/day) for 4 or 14 days ( d). Insulin levels , glucose tolerance test and HOMA index were determined. The skin sections were analyzed for histophatological and morphoquantitative data. Histopathological findings showed increased reepithelization of SBI + I and formation of a new muscle layer after 14 days. In the collagen-elastic arrangement , insulin for 4 days increased the volume fraction ( Vv) of thin collagen and elastic fibers. After 14 days , independently of injury , insulin decreased the elastic fibers. Insulin was able to reverse damages in the collagen-elastic rearrangement and stimulate reepithelization after 4 days. Untreated scald-burned animals showed higher Vv of thick collagen after 4 days , while those treated had a higher Vv of thin collagen. The Vv of elastic fibers was increased in SBI + I for 4 days. In conclusion , insulin treatment was able to stimulate reepithelization. It also reversed the damages to the collagen-elastic arrangement in the scald-burned group , improving the organization of thin collagen and increasing the Vv of elastic fibers in the injured group treated with insulin for a short time , that is , for 4 days.
