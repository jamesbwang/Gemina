 To describe historic baseline session administration practices , to assess the utility of a practice trial ( an acclimation trial) before the official balance<symptom> session , and to examine the within-session reliability of the Sway Balance<symptom> Mobile Application ( SBMA). Retrospective observational study. Middle schools , high schools , and colleges across the United States. More than 17000 student-athletes were included in the Sway Medical database with 7968 individuals meeting this study 's inclusion criteria. The Sway Medical database included the following subject characteristics for each student-athlete: age , sex , weight , and height. Balance<symptom> assessment score generated by the SBMA. Variable administration practices with significant differences between baseline session averages across methods were found. Individuals who performed an acclimation trial had a significantly higher baseline session average than those who did not. Within-session reliability estimates were in the low<symptom> to adequate range ( r = 0.53-0.78) , with higher estimates found for 2 consecutive baseline tests ( r = 0.75-0.78). For maximum clinical utility , a standardized protocol for postural control baseline acquisition is necessary. Acclimation trial should be administered before a baseline session to minimize variability , especially with only 1 to 2 baseline tests. The highest reliability was observed across 2 consecutive baseline tests within the same baseline session. We suggest obtaining baseline balance<symptom> measurements with an acclimation trial followed by a baseline session with 2 baseline tests. Prospective studies are required for validation.
