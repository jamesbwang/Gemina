 Structure identification in nontargeted metabolomics based on liquid-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ( LC-MS) remains a significant challenge. Quantitative structure-retention relationship ( QSRR) modeling is a technique capable of accelerating the structure identification of metabolites by predicting their retention , allowing false positives to be eliminated during the interpretation of metabolomics data. In this work , 191 compounds were grouped according to molecular weight and a QSRR study was carried out on the 34 resulting groups to eliminate false positives. Partial least squares ( PLS) regression combined with a Genetic algorithm ( GA) was applied to construct the linear QSRR models based on a variety of VolSurf + molecular descriptors. A novel dual-filtering approach , which combines Tanimoto similarity ( TS) searching as the primary filter and retention index ( RI) similarity clustering as the secondary filter , was utilized to select compounds in training sets to derive the QSRR models yielding R
