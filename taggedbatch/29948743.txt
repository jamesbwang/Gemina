 Pharmacovigilance started about 170 years ago , although it was not yet named as such at that time. It is structured activity in the professional health field , with important social and commercial implications aimed at monitoring the risk/benefit ratio of drugs , improving patient 's safety and the quality of life. In this commentary we report the milestones of pharmacovigilance up to the present day , in order to understand all the steps that have characterized the historical evolution; from the first reports , which were essentially letters or warnings sent by clinicians to publishers of important and famous scientific journals , up to today 's modern and ultra-structured electronic registries. The historical phases also help us to understand why pharmacovigilance helped us to achieve such important results for man 's health and for pharmacology itself , and to identify the challenges that await Pharmacovigilance in future years.
