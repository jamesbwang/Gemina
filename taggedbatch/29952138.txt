 Understanding the microstructure in heterostructured nanoparticles is crucial to harnessing their properties. Although microscopy is ideal for this purpose , it allows for the analysis of only a few nanoparticles. Thus , there is a need for structural methods that take the whole sample into account. Here , a novel bulk-approach based on the combined analysis of synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction with whole powder pattern modeling , Rietveld and pair distribution function is presented. The microstructural temporal evolution of FeO/Fe
