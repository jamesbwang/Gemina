 The aim of this study was to determine the biomechanical parameters that explain ventral start performance in swimming. For this purpose , 13 elite swimmers performed different variants of the ventral start technique. Two-dimensional video analyses of the aerial and underwater phases were used to assess 16 kinematic parameters from the starting signal to 5 m , and an instrumented starting block was used to assess kinetic data. A Lasso regression was used to reduce the number of parameters , providing the main determinants to starting performance , revealing different combinations of key determinants , depending on the variant ( r ² ≥ 0.90) , with flight distance being the most relevant to all variants ( r ≤ -0.80; p < .001). Also , special attention should be given to the total horizontal impulse in the grab start ( r = -0.79; p < .001) and to the back foot action in the track and kick starts ( r ≤ 0.61; p < .001). In addition , we provide two equations that could be easily used to predict starting performance by assessing block time and flight time ( r ² = 0.66) or block time and flight distance ( r ² = 0.83). These data provide relevant contributions to the further understanding of the biomechanics of swimming starts as well as insights for performance analysis and targeted interventions to improve athlete performance.
