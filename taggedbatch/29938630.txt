 Asbestos was used in numerous products until its total ban in Denmark in 1988. The prevalence of asbestosis and pleural plaques does not yet appear to be falling. Unfortunately the statistics are unreliable due to errors in the Danish translation of the ICD-10 codes of the disease. In this review , clinical and radiologic diagnostic criteria of asbestosis and pleural plaques and recommendations for follow-up of patients are described. Typical changes on a high-resolution CT scan combined with relevant asbestos exposure is essential for the diagnosis. Asbestosis and pleural plaques are both notifiable in Denmark.
