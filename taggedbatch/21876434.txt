 Papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC) is a common endocrine malignancy with relatively good prognosis. Radioactive iodine ( RAI) is considered effective for patients with total or nearly total thyroidectomy , but the beneficial effects of RAI are still controversial. To determine whether RAI therapy could improve the survival rates of PTC patients , we conducted a retrospective analysis using data from the National Cancer Institute 's Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results ( SEER) program. Disease-specific survival ( DSS) was obtained using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regressions. DSS was improved by RAI ablation in patients with tumor > 2 cm , age > 45 years and gross extrathyroidal or lymph node metastasis. In a further analysis , RAI therapy did not improve the DSS in patients with tumor < 2 cm except those with distant metastasis. For patients with tumor > 2 cm , those involving gross extrathyroidal extension , age > 45 years or disease in the lymph nodes , DSS was improved after RAI therapy. Patients with distant metastasis always benefited from RAI ablation. RAI ablation should be recommended to patients with tumor < 2 cm and distant metastasis or patients with tumor > 2 cm and one of the following risk factors: gross extrathyroidal extension , age > 45 years , lymph node and distant metastases.
