 The whole-brain criterion of death provides that a person who has irreversibly lost all clinical functions of the brain is dead. Bedside brain death ( BD) tests permit physicians to determine BD by showing that the whole-brain criterion of death has been fulfilled. In a nonsystematic literature review , we identified and analyzed case reports of a mismatch between the whole-brain criterion of death and bedside BD tests. We found examples of patients diagnosed as BD who showed ( 1) neurologic signs compatible with retained brain functions , ( 2) neurologic signs of uncertain origin , and ( 3) an inconsistency between standard BD tests and ancillary tests for BD. Two actions can resolve the mismatch between the whole-brain criterion of death and BD tests: ( 1) loosen the whole-brain criterion of death by requiring only the irreversible cessation of relevant brain functions and ( 2) tighten BD tests by requiring an ancillary test proving the cessation of intracranial blood flow. Because no one knows the precise brain functions whose loss is necessary to fulfill the whole-brain criterion of death , we advocate tightening BD tests by requiring the absence of intracranial blood flow.
