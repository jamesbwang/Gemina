 A 4-year-old captive male central bearded dragon ( Pogona vitticeps) was presented for recurrent episodic dyspnea<symptom> and anorexia<symptom> with occasional expulsion of oral mucoid discharge. Despite empirical antimicrobial therapy and supportive care , the animal died and was submitted for autopsy. Defining histologic features included heterophilic and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia<disease> , with occasional amphophilic intranuclear inclusions<disease> and prominent type II pneumocyte hyperplasia<disease>. Transmission electron microscopy revealed intranuclear 80-nm , nonenveloped , hexagonal viral particles within pneumocytes. Helodermatid adenovirus<pathogen> 2 ( HeAdV2) was determined as the etiologic agent through pan-adenoviral consensus polymerase ( PCR) chain reaction and sequencing. Nucleic acid from a novel Mycoplasma<pathogen> sp. ( provisionally called Mycoplasma<pathogen> pogonae) was identified by pan-generic PCR targeting the mycoplasma<pathogen> 16S ribosomal RNA gene with sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. As bacteria morphologically consistent with Mycoplasma<pathogen> sp. were not observed by special stains and transmission electron microscopy , the detection of M. pogonae nucleic acid is of indeterminate significance; however , M. pogonae and HeAdV2 coinfection may have exacerbated disease.
