 Lipohypertrophy ( LH) at insulin injection sites is a common but preventable complication in type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM). We evaluated the prevalence , contributing risk factors , and consequences of LH , specifically the glycemic variability ( GV) among T1DM patients. This is a cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary care center in India , wherein 139 subjects with T1DM were randomly selected and evaluated for the presence of LH through visual and palpation examinations. Demography , anthropometry , and injecting practices were evaluated using a validated questionnaire and their effect on LH was determined. Subsequently , the effect of LH on GV and unexplained hypoglycemia ( UH) was studied. Mean glucose , mean amplitude of glycemic excursions ( MAGEs) , and continuous overlapping net glycemic action ( CONGA) were assessed in a subset of patients who injected insulin alternately in LH and non-LH sites. The overall prevalence of LH was 69.8 % , and was significantly higher in adults than in children ( P = 0.038). Improper rotation of sites ( P < 0.0001) and insulin syringe reusage for more than five times ( P = 0.009) significantly increase the risk of LH. The presence of LH has a significant effect on GV and UH with adjusted odds ratios of 17.65 ( P < 0.0001) and 28.02 ( P < 0.0001) , respectively. Ambulatory glucose monitoring on a subset of patients confirmed that the mean glucose , MAGE , and CONGA were higher when subjects injected insulin at LH sites than at non-LH sites. Improper rotation of sites and reuse of needles are the leading causes of LH in Indian T1DM patients , which , in turn , significantly increases the risk of GV and UH.
