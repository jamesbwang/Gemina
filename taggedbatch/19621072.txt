 Identifying facial expressions is crucial for social interactions. Functional neuroimaging studies show that a set of brain areas , such as the fusiform gyrus and amygdala , become active when viewing emotional facial expressions. The majority of functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) studies investigating face perception typically employ static images of faces. However , studies that use dynamic facial expressions ( e.g. , videos) are accumulating and suggest that a dynamic presentation may be more sensitive and ecologically valid for investigating faces. By using quantitative fMRI meta-analysis the present study examined concordance of brain regions associated with viewing dynamic facial expressions. We analyzed data from 216 participants that participated in 14 studies , which reported coordinates for 28 experiments. Our analysis revealed bilateral fusiform and middle temporal gyri , left amygdala , left declive of the cerebellum and the right inferior frontal gyrus. These regions are discussed in terms of their relation to models of face processing.
