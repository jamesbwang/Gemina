 As a result of their ability to transform into bulk cancer cells and their resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy , cancer stem cells ( CSCs) are currently considered as a major obstacle for cancer treatment. Application of multiple drugs using nanocarriers is a promising approach to simultaneously eliminate noncancer stem cells ( non-CSCs) and CSCs. Herein , to employ the advantages of nanomedicine while avoiding new excipients , pH-responsive prodrug ( PEG-CH ═ N-DOX) was employed as the surfactant to fabricate cargo-free nanomedicine for codelivery of DOX conjugated prodrug with SN38 to synergistically eradicate breast cancer stem cells ( bCSCs) and non-bCSCs. Through the intermolecular interaction between DOX and SN38 , PEG-CH ═ N-DOX and SN38 were assembled together to form a stable nanomedicine. This nanomedicine not only dramatically enhanced drug accumulation efficiency at the tumor site but also effectively eliminated bCSCs and non-bCSCs , which resulted in achieving a superior in vivo tumor inhibition activity. Additionally , the biosafety of this nanomedicine was systematically studied through immunohistochemistry , blood biochemistry assay , blood routine examination , and metabolomics. The results revealed that this nanomedicine significantly reduced the adverse effects of DOX and SN38. Therefore , this simple yet efficient nanomedicine provided a promising strategy for future clinical applications.
