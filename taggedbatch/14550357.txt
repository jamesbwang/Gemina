 Assess the primary causes and preventability of maternal near misses ( MNM) and mortalities ( MM) at the largest tertiary referral hospital in Rwanda , Kigali University Teaching Hospital ( CHUK). We reviewed records for all women admitted to CHUK with pregnancy-related complications between January 1st , 2015 and December 31st , 2015. All maternal deaths and near misses , based on WHO near miss criteria were reviewed ( Appendix A). A committee of physicians actively involved in the care of pregnant women in the obstetric-gynecology department reviewed all maternal near misses/ pregnancy-related deaths to determine the preventability of these outcomes. Preventability was assessed using the Three Delays Model. ( 1) Descriptive statistics were used to show qualitative and quantitative outcomes of the maternal near miss and mortality. We identified 121 maternal near miss ( MNM) and maternal deaths. The most common causes of maternal near miss and maternal death were sepsis/severe systemic<disease> infection<disease> ( 33.9 %) , postpartum hemorrhage<symptom> ( 28.1 %) , and complications from eclampsia ( 18.2 %)/ severe preeclampsia ( 5.8 %)/. In our obstetric population , MNM and deaths occurred in 87.6 % and 12.4 % respectively. Facility level delays ( diagnostic and therapeutic) through human error or mismanagement ( provider issues) were the most common preventable factors accounting for 65.3 % of preventable maternal near miss and 10.7 % maternal deaths , respectively. Lack of supplies , blood , medicines , ICU space , and equipment ( system issues) were responsible for 5.8 % of preventable maternal near misses and 2.5 % of preventable maternal deaths. Delays in seeking care contributed to 22.3 % of cases and delays in arrival from home to care facilities resulted in 9.1 % of near misses and mortalities. Cesarean delivery was the most common procedure associated with sepsis/death in our population. Previous cesarean delivery ( 24 %) and obstructed/prolonged labor ( 13.2 %) contributed to maternal near miss and mortalities. The most common preventable causes of MNM and deaths were medical errors , shortage of medical supplies , and lack of patient education/understanding of obstetric emergencies. Reduction in medical errors , improved supply/equipment availability and patient education in early recognition of pregnancy-related danger signs will reduce the majority of delays associated with MNM and mortality in our population.
