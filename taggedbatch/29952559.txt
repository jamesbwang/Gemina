 The electrochemical reduction of trivalent samarium in a LiCl-KCl eutectic melt produced highly stable divalent samarium , whose electrochemical properties and electronic structure in the molten salt were investigated using cyclic voltammetry , UV-vis absorption spectroscopy , laser-induced emission spectroscopy , and density functional theory ( DFT) calculations. Diffusion coefficients of Sm
