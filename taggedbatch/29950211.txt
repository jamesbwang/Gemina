 To investigate the clinical significance of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 expression level in bone<disease> marrow of patients with acute non-M3 myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML non-M3) , and to understand the biological characteristics of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 positive AML expressing lymphoid antigens CD19 , CD56 and its effect on the initially induced remission rate and prognosis. The expression level of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 in bone<disease> marrow of 200 patients with newly diagnosed AML ( non-M3) was detected by real-time fluorescent Q-PCR , the expression level of lymphoid antigens was detected by flow cytometry , and the relationship of the initially induced remission rate ( CR1) with the overall survival ( OS) rate was analyzed , the CR1 and OS differences also were analyzed between CD56 The CD56 The bone<disease> marrow CD56
