 Mucorales can cause cutaneous to deep-seated infections , mainly in the immunocompromised host , resulting in high mortality rates due to late and inefficient treatment. In this study , Galleria mellonella larvae were evaluated as a heterologous invertebrate host to study pathogenicity of clinically relevant mucormycetes ( Rhizopus<pathogen> spp. , Rhizomucor<pathogen> spp. , Lichtheimia<pathogen> spp. , Mucor<pathogen> spp.). All tested species were able to infect G. mellonella larvae. Virulence potential was species-specific and correlated to clinical relevance. Survival of infected larvae was dependent on ( a) the species ( growth speed and spore size) , ( b) the infection dose , ( c) the incubation temperature , ( d) oxidative stress tolerance , and ( e) iron availability in the growth medium. Moreover , we exploited the G. mellonella system to determine antifungal efficacy of liposomal amphotericin B , posaconazole , isavuconazole , and nystatin-intralipid. Outcome of in vivo treatment was strongly dependent upon the drug applied and the species tested. Nystatin-intralipid exhibited best activity against Mucorales , followed by posaconazole , while limited efficacy was seen for liposomal amphotericin B and isavuconazole. Pharmacokinetic properties of the tested antifungals within this alternative host system partly explain the limited treatment efficacy. In conclusion , G. mellonella represents a useful invertebrate infection model for studying virulence of mucormycetes , while evaluation of treatment response was limited.
