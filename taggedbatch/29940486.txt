 Checkpoint kinase 1 ( Chk1) , a serine/threonine protein kinase , plays an important role in G2/M checkpoint , which is a key regulator in response to DNA damage. In this study , the structure-based drug design approach and molecular dynamics ( MD) simulations were used to explore potent Chk1 inhibitors. A series of the best fitting candidates were picked out from the Specs database. Out of these , five candidates were submitted for MD simulations to explore the stability of complex. The result indicates that these five candidates could be considered potential Chk1 inhibitors and represents a promising starting point for developing potent inhibitors of Chk1 for the treatment of tumor.
