 The use of oral poliovirus<pathogen> vaccine in a worldwide scale has led to a 99.9 % decrease in annual incidence of wild-type poliomyelitis<disease> and the eradication of serotype 2 poliovirus<pathogen>. However , the emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses ( VDPVs) is endangering the eradication program. Patients with combined immunodeficiencies are at increased risk of both vaccine-associated poliomyelitis<disease> and prolonged asymptomatic infection with immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs ( iVDPVs). Herein , we present a severe combined immunodeficiency patient with prolonged and asymptomatic iVDPV infection. He continued to shed poliovirus<pathogen> during immunoglobulin replacement therapy and cleared the infection following successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT). To explain the efficiency of HSCT in clearing the infection , we reviewed the literature for all reports of HSCT in iVDPV-excreting patients and discussed novel ideas about the role of different immune mechanisms , including cell-mediated interactions , in mounting immune responses against poliovirus<pathogen> infections. This study could provide further insights into the immune mechanisms contributing to the clearance of enteroviral infections.
