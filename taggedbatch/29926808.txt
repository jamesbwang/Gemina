 At the level of fundamental science , it was recently demonstrated that molecular wires can mediate long-range phase-coherent tunnelling with remarkably low attenuation over a few nanometre even at room temperature. Furthermore , a large mean free path has been observed in graphene and other graphene-like two-dimensional materials. These create the possibility of using quantum and phonon interference to engineer electron and phonon transport through nanoscale junctions for a wide range of applications such as molecular switches , sensors , piezoelectricity , thermoelectricity and thermal management. To understand transport properties of such devices , it is crucial to calculate their electronic and phononic transmission coefficients. The aim of this tutorial article is to outline the basic theoretical concepts and review the state-of-the-art theoretical and mathematical techniques needed to treat electron , phonon and spin transport in nanoscale molecular junctions. This helps not only to explain new phenomenon observed experimentally but also provides a vital design tool to develop novel nanoscale quantum devices.
