 Mettler , JH , Shapiro , R , and Pohl , MB. Effects of a hip flexor stretching program on running kinematics in individuals with limited passive hip extension. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-Tightness of the hip flexor muscle group may theoretically contribute to altered kinematics of the lumbo-pelvic-hip ( LPH) complex<pathogen> during dynamic movements. Therefore , the purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of a 3-week home-based stretching program on passive hip extension and sagittal plane kinematics of the LPH complex when running. Twenty healthy subjects with limited passive hip extension underwent a 3D gait analysis both before ( PRE) and after ( POST) a hip flexor stretching program. After the stretching program , passive hip extension increased significantly ( p < 0.001) , whereas no improvements during running were reported for active hip extension , anterior pelvic tilt , or lumbar spine extension ( p â‰¥ 0.05). In addition , no relationship was found between the change in passive hip extension with either the change in active hip extension , anterior pelvic tilt , or lumbar spine extension. A 3-week static stretching program of the hip flexor muscle group resulted in an increase in passive hip extension , but the sagittal plane kinematics of the LPH complex during running remained unchanged. The results suggest that passive hip<symptom> joint flexibility may be of limited importance in determining the kinematics of the LPH complex during submaximal running. However , it is possible that an increase in the range of motion at the hip may be beneficial when running at or near maximal speeds.
