 The continuous execution of swimming techniques , supported mainly by the upper limbs , may cause shoulder rotator muscle imbalances , which leads to injuries. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of two training programs on strength , balance<symptom> and endurance of shoulder rotator cuff muscles in youth swimmers. Twenty-five male swimmers were evaluated and randomly divided into two groups- the land group ( n = 13) , which conducted a conventional dry-land training program with elastic bands , and the water group ( n = 12) , which conducted a water resistance program. In both groups , the level of strength of the shoulder rotators was evaluated with an isokinetic dynamometer on two occasions ( baseline and after 10 weeks) using two protocols: i) three repetitions at 60
