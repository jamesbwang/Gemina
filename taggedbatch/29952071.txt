 Laser speckle contrast imaging ( LSCI) is a full-field optical imaging method for monitoring blood flow and vascular morphology with high spatiotemporal resolution. However , due to the limited depth of field of optical system , it is difficult to capture a clear blood flow image with all blood vessels focused , especially for the non-planar biological tissues. In this paper , a multi-focus image fusion method based on contourlet transform is introduced to reduce the misfocus effects in LSCI. The experimental results suggest that this method can provide an all-in-focus blood flow image , which is convenient to observe the blood vessels. This article is protected by copyright.
