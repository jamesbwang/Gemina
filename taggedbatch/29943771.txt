 Mexico has seen an increase in cancer prevalence in its entire population as well as particular age ranges , predominantly the older segment. The most frequently reported pelvic cancers in Mexico are cervical , endometrial , bladder , prostate , rectum , and anal canal. Approximately 80 % of the population diagnosed with pelvic cancers present with locally advanced tumors and require concomitant chemoradiotherapy , sequential chemoradiotherapy , or radiotherapy alone. The toxicity of any of these treatment modalities may be manifested as intestinal injury , a significant problem that can compromise the response to treatment , the patient 's nutritional state , quality of life , and survival. In this article , we will approach key aspects in nutrition as well as the epidemiological characteristics and toxicities in patients affected by these pelvic tumors.
