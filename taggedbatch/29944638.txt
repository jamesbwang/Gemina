 This study was to determine the bone protective effects and underlying mechanisms of Osthole ( OT) in ovariectomized ( OVX) mice. We found that the inhibitory effects of OT on receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand ( RANKL)- activated osteoclastogenesis are responsible for its bone protective effects in OVX mice. Eight-week-old mice were ovariectomized and OT ( 10 mg/kg/d) was intraperitoneally administrated to OVX mice 7 days after the surgery and were sacrificed at the end of the 3 months. Osteoclasts were generated from primary bone<disease> marrow macrophages ( BMMs) to investigate the inhibitory effects of OT. The activity of RANKL-activated signaling was simultaneously analyzed in vitro and in vivo using immunohistochemistry , Western blot , and PCR assays. OT dose dependently inhibited RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis in BMM cultures. OT administration attenuated bone loss ( mg Ha/cm: 894.68 ± 33.56 vs 748.08 ± 19.51 , P < 0.05) in OVX mice. OT inhibits osteoclastogenesis ( Oc.N/ per view area: 72 ± 4.3 vs 0.8 ± 0.4 , P < 0.05) and bone resorption activity ( bone resorbed percentages % , 48.56 ± 7.25 vs 3.25 ± 1.37 , P < 0.05) from BMMs. Mechanistically , OT inhibited the expressions of nuclear factor of activated T-cells c1 ( NFATc1) and c-Fos. Moreover , OT suppressed the expression of RANKL-induced osteoclast marker genes , including matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP9) , Cathepsin K ( Ctsk) , tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP) , and carbonic anhydrase II ( Car2). OT inhibits RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis and prevents bone loss in OVX mice. Our findings revealed that OT is a potential new drug for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis.
