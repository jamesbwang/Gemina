 Many genes have been suggested as candidate genes for keratoconus based on their function , their proximity to associated polymorphisms or due to the identification of putative causative variants within the gene. However , very few of these genes have been assessed for rare variation in keratoconus more broadly. In contrast , VSX1 and SOD1 have been widely assessed , however , the vast majority of studies have been small and the findings conflicting. In a cohort of Australians of European descent , consisting of 385 keratoconus cases and 396 controls , we screened 21 keratoconus candidate genes: BANP , CAST , COL4A3 , COL4A4 , COL5A1 , FOXO1 , FNDC3B , HGF , IL1A , IL1B , ILRN , IMMP2L , MPDZ , NFIB , RAB3GAP1 , RAD51 , RXRA , SLC4A11 , SOD1 , TF and VSX1. The candidate genes were sequenced in these individuals by either whole exome sequencing or targeted gene sequencing. Variants were filtered to identify rare ( minor allele frequency < 1 %) , potentially pathogenic variants. A total of 164 such variants were identified across the two groups with no variants fulfilling these criteria in cases in IL1RN , BANP , IL1B , RAD51 or SOD1. The frequency of variants was compared between cases and controls using chi-square or Fishers ' Exact tests for each gene with at least one rare potentially pathogenic variant identified in the case cohort. The number of rare potentially pathogenic variants per gene ranged from three ( RXRA) to 102 ( MPDZ) , however for all genes , there was no difference in the frequency between the cases and controls. We conclude that rare potentially pathogenic variation in the 21 candidate genes assessed do not play a major role in keratoconus susceptibility and pathogenesis.
