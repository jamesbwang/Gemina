 Despite long-standing experience with warfarin , anticoagulation clinic services are often confronted with the challenging clinical situation of patients with overanticoagulation. This requires repeat international normalized ratio ( INR) monitoring and in some cases administration of vitamin K to minimize the risk of bleeding. A study was performed to determine the safety and efficacy of outpatient management in order to provide guidance on the management of patients with prolonged INRs. Patients on stable warfarin therapy for more than 1 month attending a dedicated academic hospital anticoagulation clinic who had an INR â‰¥ 5 were identified over a 1-year period. Follow-up INR results and outcomes were recorded for 30 days. One hundred and ninety-five episodes of overanticoagulation in 148 patients were identified. Patients were classified as low risk ( n = 85 , 57.4 %) and moderate risk of bleeding ( n = 63 , 42.6 %). The mean index INR was 7.22 ( 1.88). Management with low-dose oral vitamin K ( n = 32 , 16.4 %) did not significantly result in a more rapid correction of the INR when compared to conservative management ( n = 163 , 83.6 %; P = .103). Follow-up INR testing was performed at a mean of 11.1 ( 8.9) days from the index measurement. A mean of 1.6 ( 0.9) follow-up INR tests were performed per episode. During the 30-day follow-up , there was 1 ( 0.5 %) episode of major bleeding and 1 ( 0.5 %) death. The management of asymptomatic outpatients with overanticoagulation is associated with a low risk of major bleeding within 30 days. Conservative management of overanticoagulation is as effective as utilizing low-dose oral vitamin K.
