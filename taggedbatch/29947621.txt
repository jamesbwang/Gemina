 ZnO nanowires as field emitters have important applications in flat panel display and x-ray source. Understanding the intrinsic field emission mechanism is crucial for further improving the performance of ZnO nanowire field emitters. In this article , the temperature dependent field emission from individual ZnO nanowires was investigated by an in situ measurement in ultra-high vacuum. The divergent temperature-dependent Fowler-Nordheim plots is found in the low field region. A field-induced hot electrons emission model , that takes into account penetration length , is proposed to explain the results. The carrier density and temperature dependence of the field-induced hot electrons emission current are derived theoretically. The obtained results are consistent with the experimental results , which could be attributed to the variation of effective electron temperature. All of these are important for a better understanding on the field emission process of semiconductor nanostructures.
