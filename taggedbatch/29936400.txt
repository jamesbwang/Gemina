 The bladder is not sterile but contains a healthy community of microbes termed the microbiome. Alterations in the bladder microbiome have been demonstrated in disease states such as the overactive bladder. The microbiome in other anatomical niches is known to alter with age eg the vagina. The objective of this study was to identify if the bladder microbiome in healthy women varies with age and menopausal status. Urine from 79 healthy women attending secondary care gynaecological clinics with no urinary<symptom> symptoms<symptom> provided clean catch mid-stream urine specimens. Urine was centrifuged and the resultant pellet was re-suspended and inoculated onto chocolate agar plates and cultured under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Morphologically different colonies were purity plated and 16 s rRNA gene sequencing was performed. A microbe genomic basic local alignment search tool ( BLAST) was used to identify the genus of the bacteria. There was no significant correlation between the age of a woman and the number of different genera identified ( r = -0.034 , p = 0.79). There were few significant differences in the frequency with which the majority of organisms were found in pre and post-menopausal women. The exceptions however were lactobacillus<pathogen> , which was more common in pre-menopausal women ( 31 vs 3 p = 0.002) and Mobiluncus<pathogen> , which was more common in post-menopausal women ( 0 vs 3 p = 0.02). There was no significant correlation between patient age and diversity of the bladder microbiome but large numbers of different organisms were identified. Significant differences were however observed for Lactobacillus<pathogen> which is more common in pre-menopausal women and Mobiluncus<pathogen> which is more common in post-menopausal women.
