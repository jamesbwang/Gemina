 Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic agent in the treatment of various cancers. Peripheral neuropathy is a well-known side effect of cisplatin and has the potential to result in limiting and/or reducing the dose , decreasing the quality of life. Unfortunately , the mechanism for cisplatin-induced neuropathy has not been completely elucidated. Currently , available treatments for neuropathic pain ( NP) are mostly symptomatic , insufficient and are often linked with several detrimental side effects; thus , effective treatments are needed. Cannabinoids and agmatine are endogenous modulators that are implicated in painful states. This review explains the cisplatin-induced neuropathy and antinociceptive effects of cannabinoids and agmatine in animal models of NP and their putative therapeutic potential in cisplatin-induced neuropathy.
