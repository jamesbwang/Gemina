 Magnetoelectric materials that convert magnetic fields into electricity and vice versa are rare and usually complex , hard crystalline alloys. Recent work has shown that soft , highly deformable magnetoelectric materials may be created by using a strain-mediated mechanism. The electromagnetic and elastic deformation of such materials is intricately coupled , giving rise to a rather rich instability and bifurcation behavior that may limit or otherwise put bounds on the emergent magnetoelectric behavior. In this work , we investigate the magneto-electro-mechanical instability of a soft dielectric film subject to mechanical forces and external electric and magnetic fields. We explore the interplay between mechanical strain , electric voltage and magnetic fields and their impact on the maximum voltage and the stretch the dielectric material can reach. Specifically , we present physical insights to support the prospects to achieve wireless energy harvesting through remotely applied magnetic fields.
