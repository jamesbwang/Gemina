 To determine the association between fluid resuscitation volume following pediatric burn injury and impact on outcomes. A retrospective chart review of pediatric patients ( 0-18 years) sustaining â‰¥ 15 % TBSA burn , admitted to an American Burn Association verified pediatric burn center from 2010 to 2015. Twenty-seven patients met inclusion criteria and had complete data available for analysis. Fifteen ( 56 %) patients received greater than 6ml/kg/total body surface area burn in first 24h and twelve ( 44 %) patients received less than 6ml/kg/percent total body surface area burn in first 24h. There were no differences between groups in median number of mechanical ventilator days ( 4 vs 8 , p = 0.96) , intensive care unit length of stay ( 10 vs 13.5 , p = 0.75) , or hospital length of stay ( 37 vs 37.5 , p = 0.56). Secondary analysis revealed that patients with a higher mean cumulative fluid overload ( > 253ml/kg , n = 16) had larger burn size , higher injury severity scores , and were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation and invasive support devices. Controlling for burn size , odds of longer PICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation were 20.33 ( 95 % CI ( 1.7-235.6) p = 0.02) and 27.9 ( 95 % CI ( 2.1-364.7) p = 0.01) , respectively , among patients with a high cumulative fluid overload on day 3 compared to low cumulative fluid overload. Resuscitation volume in the first 24h was not associated with adverse outcomes. Persistent cumulative fluid overload at day 3 and beyond was independently associated with adverse outcomes.
