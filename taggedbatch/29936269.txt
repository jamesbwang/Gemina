 Creativity is necessary to human survival , human prosperity , civilization and well-being. Visual creativity is an important part of creativity and is the ability to create products of novel and useful visual forms , playing important role in many fields such as art , painting and sculpture. There have been several neuroimaging studies exploring the neural basis of visual creativity. However , to date , little is known about the relationship between cortical structure and visual creativity as measured by the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. Here , we investigated the association between cortical thickness and visual creativity in a large sample of 310 healthy adults. We used multiple regression to analyze the correlation between cortical thickness and visual creativity , adjusting for gender , age and general intelligence. The results showed that visual creativity was significantly negatively correlated with cortical thickness in the left middle frontal gyrus ( MFG) , right inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG) , right supplementary motor cortex ( SMA) and the left insula. These observations have implications for understanding that a thinner prefrontal cortex ( PFC) ( e.g. IFG , MFG) , SMA and insula correspond to higher visual creative performance , presumably due to their role in executive attention , cognitive control , motor planning and dynamic switching.
