 The objective was to evaluate the influence of calving and postpartum characteristics , measured in different genetic predominance , on the postpartum rebreeding. Were evaluated 437 partum from cows that received feeding management consisting of a forage base of the native field and the mating season consisted of 90 days. The measurements were used from the data base ( age of cow , genetic predominance , body<symptom> weight , body condition score and date of calving) of the cows in the partum and postpartum period. The variables were submitted to analysis of multiple variances , multiple regression , correlation and cluster. Already the groups formed by cluster analysis were submitted to analysis of variance and F test and the means , compared by Student 's t-test , Î± = 0.05 probability. The increase in the mean at 0.14 points in the body condition score at calving and the occurrence of calving 9 days earlier at the calving season gives the Charolais genetically predominant cows repeat calves. The Nellore genetic predominance when they calved with similar body condition score ( 2.32 points) and showed a negative body<symptom> weight gain at weaning ( -3.0 kg and -2.1 kg) showed different behaviors , where they did not repeat the offspring , when they calved and weaned with smaller body<symptom> weight.
