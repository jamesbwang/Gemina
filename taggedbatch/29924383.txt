 The main white blood cell populations , neutrophils and lymphocytes , are involved in the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating the relationship between the neutrophil to lymphocyte<symptom> ratio ( NLR , a marker of subclinical inflammation<symptom>) , presence of COPD , and its exacerbations. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Pubmed , Web of Science and Scopus databases; two investigators independently reviewed suitable studies. Nine studies , from 247 initially identified , were included in the meta-analysis. Seven studies , in 775 COPD patients with stable disease and 496 healthy controls , showed a significant increase in NLR values in stable COPD ( standardised mean difference , SMD , 0.773 , 95 % CI 0.410-1.136; P < 0.001). Furthermore , in six studies in 527 COPD patients with acute exacerbation and 620 COPD patients with stable disease , NLR values were significantly higher in patients with exacerbations ( random effects SMD 0.850 , 95 % CI 0.549-1.151; P < 0.001). Our meta-analysis showed that NLR values are significantly higher in stable COPD patients when compared to healthy individuals , although the magnitude of the difference is reduced after trim and fill adjustment , and in patients with COPD exacerbations when compared to patients with stable disease. Further studies , in larger cohorts , are needed to confirm whether the NLR is a useful tool in discriminating between COPD patients with stable disease , those with acute exacerbations , and subjects without the disease.
