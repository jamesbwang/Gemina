 Conditions experienced during development have often long-lasting effects persisting into adulthood. In Drosophila , it is well-documented that larval crowding influences fitness-related traits such as body size , starvation resistance and lifespan. However , the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is not well understood. Here , we show that the effects of increased larval density on life-history traits can be explained by decreased yeast availability in the diet during development. Yeast-poor larval diet alters various life-history traits and mimics the effects of larval crowding. In particular , reduced amount of yeast in larval diet prolongs developmental time , reduces body size , increases body fat content and starvation resistance , and prolongs Drosophila lifespan. Conversely , the effects of larval crowding can be rescued by increasing the concentration of the dietary yeast in the diet during development. Altogether , our results show that the well-known effects of larval crowding on life-history traits are mainly caused by the reduced availability of dietary yeasts due to increased larval competition.
