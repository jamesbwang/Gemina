 Using an ophthalmic viscoelastic device to manage early postoperative hypotony after Baerveldt glaucoma implant ( BGI). To determine the outcome of intracameral sodium hyaluronate injection for early postoperative hypotony treatment after BGI. A retrospective study. One-hundred-and-thirty-eight patients ( 176 eyes) had BGI from January 2012 to November 2015. Those who had hypotony within 3 months postoperatively were studied. Hypotonous eyes were injected with 0.1 mL sodium hyaluronate 1.4 % intracameral on the slit-lamp. The patients were followed up weekly and the injection repeated up to 3 times if hypotony persisted. The tube was tied surgically as a last resort. The intraocular pressure and best-corrected visual acuity at week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 and month 4 were assessed. Thirty ( 17.0 %) out of 176 eyes developed early postoperative hypotony. The median intraocular pressure and median best-corrected visual acuity when hypotony first presented were 3 mmHg and 0.8 logMAR. Two eyes were excluded as they had more than 0.1 mL injection. Eight ( 29 %) of the 28 hypotonous eyes resolved after one injection , seven ( 25 %) required two and 10 ( 36 %) needed three injections. Three ( 11 %) eyes had surgical tube tie. The median intraocular pressures were 5 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 and 13 mmHg at week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 and month 4 post-injection. The median best-corrected visual acuity were 0.60 , 0.50 , 0.50 , 0.45 , 0.40 and 0.40 logMAR for the same period. Standardised intracameral 0.1 mL sodium hyaluronate 1.4 % is an effective and safe way to manage early postoperative hypotony after BGI.
