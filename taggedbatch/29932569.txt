 Diabetes is a complex , chronic illness requiring continuous medical care with multifactorial risk-reduction strategies for appropriate glycemic control. Type 2 diabetes remains a global epidemic secondary to increases in physical inactivity and obesity. While many populations are at risk , African-Americans bear a disproportionate burden from diabetes and its complications. Diabetes self-management education ( DSME) is essential to successful diabetes treatment and complication prevention. However , diabetes management requires daily patient involvement and skills. Health coaching has been very effective in assisting patients with self-care management. There is increasing evidence of the effectiveness of health coaching in terms of patient self-efficacy , adherence to treatment , behavioral changes , health service utilization , and health outcomes. Using an integrative review of the literature , the purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of health coaching as a strategy to improve glycemic control among African-American adults with type 2 diabetes. Health coaching was found to be an effective strategy in addressing poor glycemic control in African-American adults with type 2 diabetes. This integrative review articulates gaps in healthcare disparities , while capitalizing on an evidence-based , cost-effective approach to making a positive impact on the current global diabetes epidemic.
