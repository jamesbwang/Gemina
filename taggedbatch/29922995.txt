 We studied combined effect of Î²-hairpin antimicrobial peptide tachyplesin I and cytotoxic agent cisplatin on tumor and normal human cell lines. MTT assay and flow cytometry showed that tachyplesin I selectively sensitized cancer cells to cisplatin in specified concentration ratios. In vitro experiments demonstrated that combined use of tachyplesin I and cisplatin allows decreasing the effective dose of the cytostatic thus reducing nonspecific toxicity.
