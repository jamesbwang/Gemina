 Kratom , derived from the plant Mitragyna speciosa , is receiving increased attention as an alternative to traditional opiates and as a replacement therapy for opiate dependence. Mitragynine ( MG) and 7-hydroxymitragynine ( 7-HMG) are major psychoactive constituents of kratom. While MG and 7-HMG share behavioral and analgesic properties with morphine , their reinforcing effects have not been examined to date. 7-HMG , but not MG , substituted for morphine self-administration in a dose-dependent manner in the rat self-administration paradigm. Following the substitution procedure , re-assessment of morphine self-administration revealed a significant increase following 7-HMG and a significant decrease following MG substitution. In a separate cohort , 7-HMG , but not MG , engendered and maintained intravenous self-administration in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of pretreatment with nalxonaxine ( NLXZ) , a μ1 opiate receptor antagonist , and naltrindole ( NTI) , a δ opiate receptor antagonist , on 7-HMG and morphine self-administration were also examined. Both NLXZ and NTI reduced 7-HMG self-administration , whereas only NLXZ decreased morphine intake. The present results are the first to demonstrate that 7-HMG is readily self-administered , and the reinforcing effects of 7-HMG are mediated in part by μ and δ opiate receptors. In addition , prior exposure to 7-HMG increased subsequent morphine intake whereas prior exposure to MG decreased morphine intake. The present findings indicate that MG does not have abuse potential and reduces morphine intake , desired characteristics of candidate pharmacotherapies for opiate addiction and withdrawal , whereas 7-HMG should be considered a kratom constituent with high abuse potential that may also increase the intake of other opiates.
