 Recently , image-filtering based hyperspectral image ( HSI) feature extraction has been widely studied. However , due to limited spatial resolution and feature distribution complexity , the problems of cross-region mixing after filtering and spectral discriminative reduction still remain. To address these issues , this paper proposes a spectral-spatial propagation filter ( PF) based HSI feature extraction method that can effectively address the above problems. The dimensionality/band of an HSI is typically high; therefore , principal component analysis ( PCA) is first used to reduce the HSI dimensionality. Then , the principal components of the HSI are filtered with the PF. When cross-region mixture occurs in the image , the filter template reduces the weight assignments of the cross-region mixed pixels to handle the issue of cross-region mixed pixels simply and effectively. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method , experiments are carried out on three common HSIs using support vector machine ( SVM) classifiers with features learned by the PF. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively extracts the spectral-spatial features of HSIs and significantly improves the accuracy of HSI classification.
