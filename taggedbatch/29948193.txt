 Based on individual circadian cycles and associated cognitive rhythms , humans can be classified via standardised self-reports as being early ( EC) , late ( LC) and intermediate ( IC) chronotypes. Alterations in neural cortical structure underlying these chronotype differences have rarely been investigated and are the scope of this study. 16 healthy male ECs , 16 ICs and 16 LCs were measured with a 3 T MAGNETOM TIM TRIO ( Siemens , Erlangen) scanner using a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequence. Data were analysed by applying voxel-based morphometry ( VBM) and vertex-wise cortical thickness ( CTh) analysis. VBM analysis revealed that ECs showed significantly lower grey matter volumes bilateral in the lateral occipital cortex and the precuneus as compared to LCs , and in the right lingual gyrus , occipital fusiform gyrus and the occipital pole as compared to ICs. CTh findings showed lower grey matter volumes for ECs in the left anterior insula , precuneus , inferior parietal cortex , and right pars triangularis than for LCs , and in the right superior parietal gyrus than for ICs. These findings reveal that chronotype differences are associated with specific neural substrates of cortical thickness , surface areas , and folding. We conclude that this might be the basis for chronotype differences in behaviour and brain function. Furthermore , our results speak for the necessity of considering `` chronotype '' as a potentially modulating factor in all kinds of structural brain-imaging experiments.
