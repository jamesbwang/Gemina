 Cartilage is anisotropic in nature and organized into distinct zones. Our goal was to develop zonal-specific three-dimensional hybrid scaffolds which could induce the generation of zonal-specific cellular morphology and extracellular matrix ( ECM) composition. The superficial and middle zones comprised two layers of hyaluronic acid ( HA) hydrogel which enveloped specifically orientated or randomly arranged polylactic acid nanofibre meshes. The deep zone comprised a HA hydrogel with multiple vertical channels. Primary bovine chondrocytes were seeded into the individual zonal scaffolds , cultured for 14 days and then the ECM was analysed. The aligned nanofibre mesh used in the superficial zone induced an elongated cell morphology , lower glycosaminoglycan ( GAG) and collagen II production , and higher cell proliferation and collagen I production than the cells in the middle zone scaffold. Within the middle zone scaffold , which comprised a randomly orientated nanofibre mesh , the cells were clustered and expressed more collagen II. The deep zone scaffold induced the highest GAG production , the lowest cell proliferation and the lowest collagen I expression of the three zones. Assembling the three zones and stabilizing the arrangement with a HA hydrogel generated aligned , randomly aggregated and columnar cells in the superficial , middle and deep zones. This study presents a method to induce zonal-specific chondrocyte morphology and ECM production.
