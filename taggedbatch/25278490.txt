 Chemerin is a recently discovered adipokine shown to be involved in both inflammatory and metabolic processes. Here , we demonstrate that chemerin serum levels are elevated in patients with multiple myeloma and that it increases with disease progression. We found that chemerin is expressed by stromal cells and preadipocytes , whereas its receptor CCRL2 is expressed by primary myeloma cells , suggesting a paracrine signaling loop between bone<disease> marrow stromal cells/adipocytes and myeloma cells. This is the first study exploring chemerin and its receptors in multiple myeloma.
