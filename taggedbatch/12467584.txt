 To account for infants ' perceptual and cognitive development , the constructivist model proposes that learning a new object depends on the capability of processing simpler lower-level units , and then integrating these units into more complex higher-level units based on their relationships , such as regular co-occurrence. Here , we demonstrate that the process of associating visual and auditory attributes to build a new multisensory object representation is not only observed in the course of development , but also in the course of infants ' in-the-moment information processing. After a brief familiarization session of learning two pairs of novel audiovisual stimuli , 15-month-old infants showed two components in pupil dilations over time: A rapid dilation was observed when processing perceptually novel compared to familiar stimuli , and a slower dilation was observed when processing novel combinations of familiar stimuli. However , in 10-month-old infants , only the effect elicited by novel stimuli was observed. Our results therefore demonstrate that detecting perceptual novelty occurred earlier than detecting association novelty in infants ' information processing. These results support the view that infants perceive newly-learned objects by processing their constituent attributes and then integrating these components , as suggested by the constructivist model.
