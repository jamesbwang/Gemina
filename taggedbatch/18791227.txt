 Heritability , the proportion of variation in a trait that can be explained by genetic variation , is an important parameter in efforts to understand the genetic architecture of complex phenotypes as well as in the design and interpretation of genome-wide association studies. Attempts to understand the heritability of complex phenotypes attributable to genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) variation data has motivated the analysis of large datasets as well as the development of sophisticated tools to estimate heritability in these datasets. Linear mixed models ( LMMs) have emerged as a key tool for heritability estimation where the parameters of the LMMs , i.e. the variance components , are related to the heritability attributable to the SNPs analyzed. Likelihood-based inference in LMMs , however , poses serious computational burdens. We propose a scalable randomized algorithm for estimating variance components in LMMs. Our method is based on a method-of-moment estimator that has a runtime complexity O ( NMB) for N individuals and M SNPs ( where B is a parameter that controls the number of random matrix-vector multiplications). Further , by leveraging the structure of the genotype matrix , we can reduce the time complexity to O ( NMBmax ( log 3N , log 3M)). We demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our method on simulated as well as on empirical data. On standard hardware , our method computes heritability on a dataset of 500000 individuals and 100000 SNPs in 38 min.
