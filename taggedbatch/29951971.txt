 In educational and psychological measurement , researchers and/or practitioners are often interested in examining whether the ability of an examinee is the same over two sets of items. Such problems can arise in measurement of change , detection of cheating on unproctored tests , erasure analysis , detection of item preknowledge , etc.. Traditional frequentist approaches that are used in such problems include the Wald test , the likelihood ratio test , and the score test ( e.g. , Fischer , Appl Psychol Meas 27:3-26 , 2003; Finkelman , Weiss , & Kim-Kang , Appl Psychol Meas 34:238-254 , 2010; Glas & Dagohoy , Psychometrika 72:159-180 , 2007; Guo & Drasgow , Int J Sel Assess 18:351-364 , 2010; Klauer & Rettig , Br J Math Stat Psychol 43:193-206 , 1990; Sinharay , J Educ Behav Stat 42:46-68 , 2017). This paper shows that approaches based on higher-order asymptotics ( e.g. , Barndorff-Nielsen & Cox , Inference and asymptotics. Springer , London , 1994; Ghosh , Higher order asymptotics. Institute of Mathematical Statistics , Hayward , 1994) can also be used to test for the equality of the examinee ability over two sets of items. The modified signed likelihood ratio test ( e.g. , Barndorff-Nielsen , Biometrika 73:307-322 , 1986) and the Lugannani-Rice approximation ( Lugannani & Rice , Adv Appl Prob 12:475-490 , 1980) , both of which are based on higher-order asymptotics , are shown to provide some improvement over the traditional frequentist approaches in three simulations. Two real data examples are also provided.
