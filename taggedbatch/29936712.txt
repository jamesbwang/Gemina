 Background: Evidence of relationship between selenium and prostate cancer has been inconsistent. The present metaanalysis was conducted to determine relationship between selenium and prostate cancer. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis ( PRISMA). We searched PubMed , Scopus , Web of Science , ScienceDirect , Embase , CINAHL , Cochrane Library , EBSCO and Google scholar search engines and the reference lists of the retrieved papers for relevant data , without any limitation regarding language or time until 2016. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated using Q test and I2 Index. Finally , a random effects model was used for combining results using STATA software version 11.1. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Thirty-eight studies including 36,419 cases and 105,293 controls were included in the final analysis. The pooled relative risk ( RR) of relation between selenium and prostate cancer was 0.86 ( 95 % Confidence Interval ( CI): 0.78-0.94). Sub-group analyses based on case-control , cohort , and RCT studies gave values of 0.89 ( 95 % CI: 0.80-1.00) , 0.77 ( 95 % CI: 0.52-1.14) and 0.90 ( 95 % CI: 0.74-1.09) , respectively. RRs based on serum , plasma and nail samples were 0.69 ( 95 % CI: 0.51-0.95) , 0.85 ( 95 % CI: 0.61-1.17) , 0.66 ( 95 % CI: 0.41-1.05) , respectively. According to 10 studies , investigated the relation between advanced prostate cancer and selenium in which the RR was 0.67 ( 95 % CI: 0.52-0.87). Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicated that selenium most probably has a protective role against development of prostate cancer and its progression to advanced stages. Therefore , selenium supplementation can be proposed for prevention of prostate cancer.
