 This study describes the histopathological effects of carbaryl in the spleen of Levantine frog , Pelophylax bedriage. Due to its primary role in immune system , it is important to research the toxic effects of pesticides , which play an important role in environmental pollution , on spleen. To that end , adult frogs were exposed to carbaryl for 96 h. Experimental groups contained low dose , ( 0.05 mg/g) , medium dose ( 0.1 mg/g) and high dose ( 0.2 mg/g). After following exposure to carbaryl , the frogs were euthanised and dissected. In low-dose group , there were no important changes in spleen tissue. In medium-dose group , prominence in haemorrhage just below the capsule and an increase in the melanomacrophage number were determined. In high-dose group , in addition to increases in the melanomacrophages , separations in capsule , haemorrhage below capsule and within splenic tissue , sinusoidal enlargement , congestion<symptom> in dilated sinusoid , hypertrophic plasma cells and fibrosis<disease> were determined as important histological lesions<symptom> in exposed frogs. This study clearly showed that carbaryl caused important histopathological damages in splenic tissue of Pelophylax bedriagae. In view of these findings , it can be said that this insecticide has the capacity to disrupt spleen ' functions.
