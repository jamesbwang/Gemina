 Obesity is one of the most prevalent health problems in western societies. However , it seems not effectively managed in the healthcare system at present. Originating from smoking cessation a tool called the 5As for obesity management has been drafted and adapted by the Canadian Obesity Network ( CON) to improve weight counseling and provider-patient-interaction. This paper describes the rationale and design of the INTERACT study. The objective of the INTERACT study is to evaluate the effectiveness and intervention costs of a 5As eLearning program for obesity management aimed specifically at general practitioners ( GPs). The INTERACT study is a cluster randomized controlled trial aimed at implementing and evaluating an online-tutorial for obesity management based on the 5As approach in cooperating primary health care practices. Effectiveness of the 5As intervention will be evaluated by assessing patients and doctors perspectives on obesity management in primary care before and after the training. GPs in the intervention group will get access to the 5As obesity management online-tutorial while GPs in the control group will be assigned to a waiting list. Outcome measures for patients and GPs will be compared between the intervention group ( treatment as usual + training of the GP) and the control group ( treatment as usual). Hierarchical regression models will be used to analyze effects over time pre- and post-intervention. The 5As present physicians with a simple mnemonic for patient counseling in the primary care context. While the use of the 5As in weight counseling seems to be associated with improved doctor-patient interaction and motivation to lose weight , intervention studies assessing the effectiveness of a short 5A eLearning tutorial for physicians on secondary outcomes , such as weight development , are lacking. The study has been registered at the German Clinical Trials Register ( DRKS00009241; date of registration: 03.02.2016).
