 Apigenin , a flavone abundant in parsley and celery , is known to act on several CNS receptors , but its very poor water solubility ( < 0.001 mg/mL) impedes its absorption in vivo and prevents clinical use. Herein , apigenin was directly conjugated with glycine , l-phenylalanine , and l-lysine to give the corresponding carbamate derivatives , all of which were much more soluble than apigenin itself ( 0.017 , 0.018 , and 0.13 mg/mL , respectively). The Lys-apigenin carbamate 10 had a temporary sedative effect on the mice within 5 min of intraperitoneal administration ( single dose of 0.4 mg/g) and could be detected in the mice brain tissues at a concentration of 0.82 Î¼g/g of intact Lys-apigenin carbamate 10 and 0.42 ug/g of apigenin at 1.5 h. This study accomplished the delivery of apigenin across the BBB in a manner that might be applicable to other congeners , which should inform the future development of BBB-crossing flavonoids.
