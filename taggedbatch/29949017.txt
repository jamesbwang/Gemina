 Previous research has suggested that the calculation of another 's perspective is cognitively efficient , whereas perspective selection ( selection of a particular perspective , self or other) is associated with executive function , particularly inhibitory control. However , research has not previously tested how perspective calculation and selection may be associated with another key executive function , working memory. In the present study ( N = 54 adult participants) , we administered a Level-1 visual perspective task in a dual-task paradigm in which the secondary task required working memory. The results suggest that executive function is associated with both perspective calculation and perspective selection , contrary to previous evidence from similar dual-task studies that had used inhibitory control and attention-based secondary tasks. This contrast may suggest that working memory capacity facilitates perspective-taking. Furthermore , it may follow that the notion of simple perspective-taking is distinct from more the complex and cognitively demanding `` theory of mind. '' Research of this nature warrants further investigation.
