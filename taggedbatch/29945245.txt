 To determine the immediate effect of neural tension technique ( NTT) on conditioned pain modulation in patients with chronic neck<symptom> pain<symptom>. A secondary objective was to determine the immediate effect of neural tensioner technique on pain intensity and cervical range of movement. Randomized clinical trial. University medical center. Fifty-four patients with neck<symptom> pain<symptom> ( 13 males and 41 females; mean ± SD age = 20.91 ± 2.64 years) were randomly allocated to two groups: NTT or sham technique. Participants received a visual analog scale ( VAS) and neck disability index ( NDI) after inclusion. Conditioned pain modulation ( CPM) and active cervical range of motion were measured before and after the intervention. Each subject received one treatment session. The results of the analysis of variance revealed a significant effect for the group × time interaction only for CPM ( F = 11.09 , P = 0.002 , ηp2 = 0.176). No significant interactions were found for the other measures ( VAS ( F = 1.719 , P = 0.195 , ηp2 = 0.031) , pressure pain<symptom> threshold C2 ( F = 0.731 , P = 0.398 , ηp2 = 0.018) , flexion ( F = 0.176 , P = 0.677 , ηp2 = 0.003) , extension ( F = 0.035 , P = 0.852 , ηp2 = 0.001) , lateral flexions ( F = 0.422 , P = 0.519 , ηp2 = 0.008) , and rotations ( F = 1.307 P = 0.258 , ηp2 = 0.024)). Regarding CPM , intergroup interaction differences were found postintervention ( P = 0.002) with a high effect size ( d = 0.98). This study suggests that neural tension technique enhances immediate conditioned pain modulation in patients with chronic neck<symptom> pain<symptom> , but not pain intensity or cervical range of movement.
