 Copper ( ii) complexes are very promising catalysts for water oxidation. Herein new findings on the water-oxidizing activity of a few copper ( ii) complexes under water oxidation conditions are reported. Copper compounds in this study are copper ( ii) phthalocyanine-3,4 ' ,4 '' ,4 '' '- tetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt ( 1) , the product from the hydrolysis of Cu ( ii) tptz ( H2O) ( CH3COO) 2 ( tptz: 2,4,6-tris ( 2-pyridyl)- s-triazine) ( 2) , Cu ( ii) ( phen) ( CH3CN) 2 ( ClO4) 2 ( 3) , Cu ( ii) ( phen) 2 ( CH3CN) ( ClO4) 2 ( 4) , and copper ( ii) sulfate pentahydrate ( Cu ( ii) salt) , which were investigated in the context of the water oxidation reaction by electrochemical and related methods. The experiments showed that among these compounds at pH = 11 , only Cu ( ii) salt and 3 led to immediate water oxidation. On the other hand , for stable complexes 1 , 2 and 4 even after a few minutes low water oxidation rates were observed. The role of nanosized particles of Cu oxide or Cu ions in electrochemical water oxidation was investigated. Under the water oxidation conditions , the electrode , Cu ( ii) complexes and Cu ( ii) salt were studied and a relationship between the stability of the Cu ( ii) complex<pathogen> and water oxidation rate was suggested. It is proposed that Cu ( ii) ions or clusters , rather than the starting copper ( ii) complex<pathogen> or copper ( ii) oxide , are the true catalysts for the investigated water oxidation process in short-term amperometry. For 3 and in long-term amperometry , CuOx was detected. The experiments showed that a molecular mechanism for the water oxidation reaction in the presence of copper ( ii) complexes should be carefully analyzed to verify the role of copper ions or cluster formation in the water oxidation reaction.
