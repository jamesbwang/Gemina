 To investigate the polymerization kinetics and the degree of conversion ( DC) of experimental resin composites with varying amount of bioactive glass 45S5 ( BG). Experimental resin composites based on a photo-curable Bis-GMA/TEGDMA resin system were prepared. The composite series contained 0 , 5 , 10 , 20 , and 40 wt % of BG and reinforcing fillers up to the total filler amount of 70 wt %. Composite specimens were light cured with 1219 mW/cm The 5-min DC values for experimental composites were in the range of 42.4-55.9 % and 47.3-57.9 % for curing times of 20 and 40 s , respectively. The differences in the 5-min DC between curing times of 20 s or 40 s became more pronounced in materials with higher BG amount. Within both curing times , a decreasing trend of the 5-min DC values was observed with the increasing percentage of BG fillers. The maximum polymerization rate also decreased consistently with the increasing BG amount. Unsilanized BG fillers showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on polymerization rate and the DC. Extending the curing time from 20 to 40 s showed a limited potential to improve the DC of composites with higher BG amount. The observed inhibitory effect of BG fillers on the polymerization of resin composites may have a negative influence on mechanical properties and biocompatibility.
