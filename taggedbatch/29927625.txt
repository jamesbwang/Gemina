 To study the use of alcohol and drugs among the general driving population in the south-eastern part of Norway and to compare the findings with the results from a similar roadside survey in 2008-9. A roadside survey of drivers of cars , vans , motorcycles and mopeds was performed from April 2016 to April 2017 in collaboration with the Mobile Police Service. Oral fluid was collected using the Quantisal device and analysed for alcohol , illicit drugs and psychoactive medicinal drugs. Age , sex , time and geographical region were recorded. Of the 5556 drivers who were asked to participate in the study , 518 drivers ( 9.3 %) declined to participate , and four samples contained insufficient volume of oral fluid to be analysed; thus , 5034 drivers were included. Fifteen drivers ( 0.3 %) suspected by the police for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs refused to participate in the study , so the alcohol and drug findings represent minimum values. The weighted prevalence of alcohol concentrations above the legal limit 0.2 g/L was 0.2 % , which is similar to the finding in the 2008-9 survey. The weighted prevalences of medicinal drugs and illicit drugs were 3.0 % and 1.7 % , respectively; those numbers included some more drugs than in 2008-9 survey and are therefore not comparable. The most prevalent illicit and medicinal drugs were tetrahydrocannabinol ( 1.3 %) and zopiclone ( 1.4 %). The prevalences of benzodiazepines and amphetamines were significantly lower than detected in the 2008-9 survey. Only one sample tested positive for a New Psychoactive Substance. The proportion of samples that tested positive for alcohol had not changed since 2008-9 , whereas the proportions that tested positive for benzodiazepines and amphetamines were lower. There are several possible reasons for the reduction: implementation of legal limits for 28 drugs in 2012-16 , increased use of drug recognition tests , the implementation of drug screening instruments and automatic number plate recognition by the police since 2010 , more focused enforcement of the DUI law , better information to drivers , and changes in drug prescriptions.
