 Activation of brown adipose tissue ( BAT) contributes to total body energy expenditure through energy dissipation as heat. Activated BAT increases the clearance of lipids and glucose from the circulation , but how BAT accommodates large influx of multiple substrates is not well defined. The purpose of this work was to assess the metabolic fluxes in brown adipocytes during β3-adrenergic receptor ( β3-AR) activation.T37i murine preadipocytes were differentiated into brown adipocytes and we used Seahorse respirometry employing a set of specific substrate inhibitors in the presence or absence of β3-AR agonist CL316 ,243. The main substrate used by these brown adipocytes were fatty acids , which were oxidized equally during activation as well as during resting condition. ( U-
