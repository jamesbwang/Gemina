 Family stories help shape identity and provide a foundation for navigating life events during adolescence and early adulthood. However , little research examines the types of stories passed onto adolescents and emerging adults , the extent to which these stories are retained and accessible , and the potentially influential parental- and self-identity content constructed in telling these stories. Across three samples , we investigate the accessibility and functions of intergenerational narratives that adolescents and emerging adults know of their parents. By examining adolescents ' open-ended intergenerational stories , emerging adults ' intergenerational stories of parents ' transgression and proud moments , and emerging adults ' intergenerational stories of parents ' self-defining moments , we systematically describe the functions of various intergenerational stories during adolescence and early adulthood , when identity is in formation. We found that adolescents and emerging adults can readily recount intergenerational stories from parents , and that many of these stories serve to build relationships with the parent , provide insights about parents , provide insights about self , and transmit life lessons. The specific findings by narrative topic and by gender of both participant and parent are discussed.
