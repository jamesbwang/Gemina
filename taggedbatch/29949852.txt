 Perilla seed protein ( PSP) was extracted from defatted perilla seed meal and applied in oil-in-water ( O/W) emulsions as an emulsifier. We investigated the influences of protein concentration ( 0.25 ⁻ 1.5 wt %) , pH ( 3.0 ⁻ 9.0) , NaCl concentration ( 0 ⁻ 350 mmol/L) and thermal treatment ( 70 ⁻ 90 & deg; C , 30 min) on the physical characteristics of O/W emulsions , including volume-average diameter , & zeta;- potential , interfacial protein concentration , microstructure and so on. Results showed that increasing PSP concentration would decrease the
