 Recent studies have suggested height as a risk factor for glioma , but less is known regarding body mass index ( BMI) or other anthropomorphic measures. We evaluated the association between body habitus and risk of glioma. We evaluated the association of measures of height , BMI , waist circumference , and somatotypes with risk of glioma in two prospective cohorts , the Nurses ' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. We documented 508 incident cases of glioma ( 321 glioblastoma ( GBM)). In both cohorts , we found no significant association between adult BMI or waist circumference and risk of glioma , with pooled HR for BMI of 1.08 ( 95 % CI 0.85-1.38 comparing â‰¥ 30 to < 25 kg/m Adult<disease> BMI and waist circumference were not associated with glioma. Higher BMI at age 21 for men and at age 18 for women was modestly associated with risk in the pooled cohort. Based on body somatotypes , however , women with heavier body types during childhood and young adulthood may be at lower risk of glioma , although this association was not observed later in life with measurements of BMI. Greater height was associated with increased risk , and the trend was more pronounced in women.
