 In recent years , the emphasis of scientific inquiry has shifted from whole-genome analyses to an understanding of cellular responses specific to tissue , developmental stage or environmental conditions. One of the central mechanisms underlying the diversity and adaptability of the contextual responses is alternative splicing ( AS). It enables a single gene to encode multiple isoforms with distinct biological functions. However , to date , the functions of the vast majority of differentially spliced protein isoforms are not known. Integration of genomic , proteomic , functional , phenotypic and contextual information is essential for supporting isoform-based modeling and analysis. Such integrative proteogenomics approaches promise to provide insights into the functions of the alternatively spliced protein isoforms and provide high-confidence hypotheses to be validated experimentally. This manuscript provides a survey of the public databases supporting isoform-based biology. It also presents an overview of the potential global impact of AS on the human canonical gene functions , molecular interactions and cellular pathways.
