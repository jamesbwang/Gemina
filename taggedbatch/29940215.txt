 Recent studies reported seasonality in healthcare-associated infections ( HCAI). The association of this phenomenon with other risk factors for HCAI is not clear. To analyze the interplay of season , weather and usual predictors of healthcare-associated bloodstream infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli ( GNB-BSI). A case-only study was conducted in a teaching hospital in Brazil. The study enrolled 446 subjects with GNB-BSI diagnosed from July 2012 through June 2016. Demographic data , comorbidities , invasive procedures and use of antimicrobials were reviewed in medical charts. The season in which GNB-BSI occurred , as well as weather parameters of the day of diagnosis , were recorded. We analyzed factors associated with occurrence of GNB-BSI in different seasons ( with winter as reference category) and caused by different GNB ( reference category , Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen>). Univariate and multivariable models of multinomial logistic regressions were used for analysis. GNB-BSI diagnosed in summer was more likely to be caused by Klebsiella<pathogen> spp. ( OR , 5.33; 95 % CI , 2.04-13.96) or Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> ( OR , 2.69; 95 % CI , 1.04-6.96) , and there was an association of Klesbiella spp. and spring ( OR , 2.86; 95 % CI , 1.14-7.18). Average temperature ( in Celsius degrees ( Â°C)) in the day of diagnosis was associated with Klebsiella<pathogen> spp. ( OR , 1.19; 95 % CI , 1.07-1.33) and A.<pathogen> baumannii ( OR , 1.20; 95 % CI , 1.07-1.34). Warm seasons and daily temperature impact on the etiology of GNB-BSI , even in models adjusted for usual risk factors. One possible explanation for our findings is that seasonality of healthcare-associated pathogens is intrinsic to microorganisms , and not associated with comorbidities , procedures or use of antimicrobials.
