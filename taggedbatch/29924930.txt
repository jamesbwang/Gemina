 Efficient rare earth elements ( REEs) separation and recovery are crucial to meet the ever-increasing demand for REEs extensively used in various high technology devices. Herein , we synthesized a highly stable chromium-based metal-organic framework ( MOF) structure , Cr-MIL-101 , and its derivatives with different organic functional groups ( MIL-101-NH
