 We compared the direct inotropic and lusitropic effects of two inodilators , milrinone and levosimendan in patients after aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis. In this randomised , blinded study , 31 patients with normal LV function , were randomised to either levosimendan ( 0.1 and 0.2 μg/kg/min , n = 15) or milrinone ( 0.4 and 0.8 μg/kg/min , n = 16) after aortic valve replacement. The effects on LV performance , LV strain , systolic ( SR-S) and early diastolic ( SR-E) strain rate were assessed by a pulmonary artery catheter and transoesophageal two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography of the LV inferior wall. To circumvent the inodilator-induced hemodynamic changes on LV systolic and diastolic deformation , central venous pressure ( CVP) , systolic artery pressure ( SAP) , and heart rate were maintained constant by colloid infusion , phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction and atrial pacing , respectively , during drug infusion. Both inotropic agents induced a dose-dependent increase in cardiac index and stroke volume index by approximately 20 % at the highest infusion rates with no differences between groups ( P = .139 and .249 , respectively). CVP , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure , SAP and heart rate were maintained constant in both groups. LV strain and SR-S increased with both agents , dose-dependently , by 17 % -18 % and 25 % -30 % , respectively , at the highest infusion rates , with no difference between groups ( P = .434 and .284 , respectively). Both agents improved early LV relaxation with no differences between groups ( P = .637). At the higher doses , both agents increased SR-E by 30 %. At clinically relevant infusion rates and a certain increase in LV performance the direct inotropic and lusitropic of milrinone and levosimendan were comparable.
