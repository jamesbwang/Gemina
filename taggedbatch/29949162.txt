 Polymorphisms of a single nucleotide in resistin gene ( RETN) have been associated with insulin resistance. We decide to investigate the role of this polymorphism on insulin resistance and resistin levels after two hypocaloric diets. A sample of 361 obese non-diabetic Caucasian was enrolled. Biochemical evaluation and anthropometric data were measured at the start of the trial and repeated after 3 months of both diets ( Diet P , Polyunsaturated vs. diet M , Monounsaturated). With both diets and in both genotype groups , BMI , weight , fat mass , waist circumference , systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> decreased. After diet P , insulin levels ( GG vs. GC+CC genotypes) ( -1.2 ± 3.8 UI/L vs. -0.7 ± 2.1 UI/L; p < 0.05) , HOMA-IR ( -0.6 ± 1.0 units vs. -0.4 ± 0.9 units; p < 0.05) , total cholesterol ( -10.5 ± 20.1 mg/dl vs. -6.1 ± 15.1 mg/dl; p < 0.05) and LDL-total cholesterol ( -8.6 ± 10.1 mg/dl vs. -2.2 ± 9.1 mg/dl; p < 0.05) decreased in subjects with GG genotype. After diet M , insulin levels ( -1.8 ± 2.1 UI/L vs. -0.6 ± 3.0 UI/L: p > 0.05) , HOMA-IR ( -0.5 ± 1.0 units vs. -0.3 ± 1.1 units: p > 0.05) , total cholesterol ( -9.5 ± 13.1 mg/dl vs. -4.4 ± 8.1 mg/dl; p < 0.05) and LDL-total cholesterol ( -8.1 ± 6.1 mg/dl vs. -2.9 ± 9.1 mg/dl; p < 0.05) decreased , too. We suggest that GG genotype of RETN rs1862513 could be a predictor of the reduction of HOMA-IR , insulin , and LDL cholesterol secondary to two hypocaloric diet in obese subjects.
