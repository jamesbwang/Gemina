 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Aripiprazole lauroxil ( AL) , a long-acting injectable antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia , requires 21 days of oral aripiprazole supplementation upon initiation ( 21-day initiation regimen). An alternative 1-day initiation regimen utilizing a nano-crystalline milled dispersion of AL ( AL In total , 12,768 plasma aripiprazole concentrations from 343 patients ( from 4 clinical studies) were included in the PopPK analysis and used to construct the model. Concomitant administration of the 1-day initiation regimen with all approved AL dosing regimens ( 441 , 662 , or 882 mg monthly , 882 mg every 6 weeks , or 1064 mg every 2 months) is predicted to achieve aripiprazole concentrations associated with therapeutic doses of AL using the 21-day initiation regimen within 4 days , maintaining these concentrations until the next AL dose. Administration of the first AL injection 10 days after the 1-day initiation regimen resulted in median aripiprazole concentrations just before the second dose of AL ≥ 77 % of that when coadministered on the same day. Coadministration of AL with a single AL Model-based simulations demonstrate that the 1-day initiation regimen is suitable for starting treatment with all AL doses , allowing a window of ≤ 10 days between initiation and AL administration.
