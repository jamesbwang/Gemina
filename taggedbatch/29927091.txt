 The successful infection of macrophages by non-typhoidal serovars of Salmonella<pathogen><disease> enterica<pathogen> is likely essential to the establishment of the systemic<disease> disease<disease> they sometimes cause in susceptible human populations. However , the interactions between Salmonella and human macrophages are not widely studied , with mouse macrophages being a much more common model system. Fundamental differences between mouse and human macrophages make this less than ideal. Additionally , the inability of human macrophage-like cell lines to replicate some properties of primary macrophages makes the use of primary cells desirable. Here we present protocols to study the infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages with Salmonella<pathogen><disease><pathogen> Typhimurium<pathogen>. These include a method for differentiating monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro and protocols for infecting them with Salmonella<pathogen><disease><pathogen> Typhimurium<pathogen> , as well as assays to measure the extent of infection , replication , and death. These protocols are useful for the investigation of both bacterial and host factors that determine the outcome of infection. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
