 We describe our technique for the management of late-onset liquefied after-cataract ( LAC) to ensure long-term visual axis clarity. The densely adherent anterior capsular rim over the intraocular lens ( IOL) optic was released with the help of microvitreoretinal blade , and multiple relaxing radial incisions were made on the capsular rim to facilitate easy access to the capsular bag. A thorough capsular bag lavage was performed with the help of bimanual irrigation-aspiration. Posterior continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis ( PCCC) was performed after complete aspiration of fluid after-cataract to prevent recurrence. This technique was successfully performed in 14 cases. Postoperatively , IOL was stable and an uncorrected distance visual acuity of > 20/32 was achieved in all cases. No recurrence was observed in any case over a follow-up of 1 year. Our technique of capsular bag lavage with PCCC is safe and effective for the management of LAC with optimal visual and anatomical outcomes.
