 Intramedullary spinal<disease> cord abnormalities are often challenging to diagnose. Spinal<disease> cord biopsy is a high-risk procedure with the potential to cause permanent neurological injury. Magnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice for diagnosis and preoperative assessment of patients with spinal<disease> cord abnormalities. The radiologist 's ability to narrow the differential diagnosis of spinal<disease> cord abnormalities has the potential to save patients from invasive approaches for diagnosis and also guide appropriate management. This article will provide a systematic approach to the evaluation of intramedullary spinal<disease> cord lesions-with emphasis on location , length and segment distribution , and enhancement pattern-to help narrow the differential diagnosis. In doing so , we will review various spinal<disease> cord pathologies , including demyelinating and metabolic conditions , neoplasms , and vascular lesions<symptom>. Although intramedullary spinal<disease> cord abnormalities can be a challenge for the radiologist , a systematic approach to the differential diagnosis with a focus on lesion<symptom> location , cord length and segment involvement , as well as enhancement pattern , can greatly help narrow the differential diagnosis , if not synch the diagnosis. This strategy will potentially obviate the need for an invasive approach to diagnosis and help guide treatment. • Imaging diagnosis of intramedullary spinal<disease> cord lesions<symptom> could obviate cord biopsy. • Evaluation of cord lesions<symptom> should focus on location , length , and enhancement pattern. • In demyelination , the degree of cross-sectional involvement is a distinguishing feature.
