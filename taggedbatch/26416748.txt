 Dissecting cellular differentiation hierarchies in the mammary gland is a prerequisite for understanding both normal development and malignant transformation during tumorigenesis and tumor cell-of-origin. To achieve these goals , several recent papers utilized single cell RNA-seq and lineage tracing to improve our understanding of the composition of the mammary epithelium at different developmental stages.
