 The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of Hybrid-coat combined with composite resin filling on reducing hypersensitivity<disease> of dental wedge-shaped defect. Seventy cases , 159 teeth with sensitive wedge-shaped defects were selected. The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups and treated as below: 35 cases , 81 teeth in group A were treated with Hybrid-coat combined with composite resin; 35 cases ,78 teeth in group B were treated with composite resin directly. After treatments , the effective rates under clinical examination standard ( immediately , 1 , 3 and 6 months after filling) in both groups were collected and statistically analysed with SPSS 13.0 software package. In group A , one and 2 teeth fillings fell off 3 months and 6 months after treatments , respectively. In group B , 2 teeth fillings fell off 6 months after operation. There was no significant difference between the two groups. The effective rate of desensitization was 91.36 % , 88.89 % , 79.01 % and 70.37 % , respectively , which was higher than those of group B ( 78.21 % , 76.92 % , 69.23 % and 61.54 % , respectively). There was significant difference between the two groups immediately and 1 months after treatment ( P < 0.05) , but there was no significant difference between the two groups 3 months and 6 months after treatment. Hybrid-coat combined with composite resin is effective in reducing sensitivity of wedge-shaped defects.
