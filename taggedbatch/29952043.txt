 Intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion ( II/R) injury is a serious clinical problem. Here we have investigated novel mechanisms and new drug targets in II/R injury by searching for microRNAs regulating such injury. We used hypoxia/reoxygenation ( H/R) of IEC-6 cell cultures and models of II/R models in rats and mice. Microarray assays were used to identify target miRNAs from rat intestinal. Real-time PCR , Western blot and dual luciferase reporter assays , and agomir and antagomir in vitro and in vivo were used to assess the effects of the target miRNA on II/R injury. The miR-351-5p was differentially expressed in our models and it targeted MAPK13 and sirtuin-6. This miRNA reduced levels of sirtuin-6 and AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation , and activated forkhead box O3 ( FoxO3α) phosphorylation to cause oxidative stress. Also , miR-351-5p markedly reduced MAPK13 level , activated polycystic kidney disease 1/NF-κB signal and increased NF-κB ( p65). Moreover , miR-351-5p up-regulated levels of Bcl2-associated X , cytochrome c , apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 , cleaved-caspase 3 and cleaved-caspase 9 by reducing sirtuin-6 levels to promote apoptosis. In addition , miR-351-5p mimic in IEC-6 cells and agomir in mice aggravated these effects , and miR-351-5p inhibitor and antagomir in mice alleviated these actions. Our data showed that miR-351-5p aggravated II/R injury by promoting intestinal mucosal oxidative stress , inflammation<symptom> and apoptosis by targeting MAPK13 and sirtuin-6. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms regulating II/R injury , and of miR-351-5p could be considered as a novel therapeutic target for such injury.
