 Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) is a highly heterogeneous autoimmune disease that preferentially affects women of child-bearing age. Most current treatments for SLE with the exception of belimumab are not target-specific. Non-targeted therapy such as corticosteroids , cyclophosphamide , and other immunosuppressive drugs results in unwanted adverse effects. Although progress in treatment , including supportive therapy , has dramatically improved the prognosis of patients with SLE , better treatment drugs and protocols with fewer adverse effects and higher efficacy for the most severe form of SLE are needed. Advancements in genomics , immunology , and pathophysiology in the field of systemic autoimmunity have provided physicians with increasing knowledge , but the most appropriate treatment for each patient with SLE remains to be established. Therefore , the search for novel treatment targets in patients with SLE is ongoing. This review focuses on recent findings in the genetics of lupus and the abnormalities in cellular interactions , cytokine profiles , and intracellular signaling in patients with SLE. Novel molecular targets for lupus , mostly introduced through clinical trials , are then discussed based on these findings.
