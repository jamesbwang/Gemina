 Managing depression<symptom> in primary care settings has increased with the rise of integrated models of care , such as patient-centered medical homes ( PCMHs). The relationship between patient experience in PCMH settings and receipt of depression<symptom> treatment is unknown. In a large sample of Veterans diagnosed with depression<symptom> , we examined whether positive PCMH experiences predicted subsequent initiation or continuation of treatment for depression<symptom>. We conducted a lagged cross-sectional study of depression<symptom> treatment among Veterans with depression<symptom> diagnoses ( n = 27,362) in the years before ( Y1) and after ( Y2) they completed the Veterans Health Administration 's national 2013 PCMH Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients. We assessed patient experiences in four domains , each categorized as positive/moderate/negative. Depression<symptom> treatment , determined from administrative records , was defined annually as 90 days of antidepressant medications or six psychotherapy visits. Multivariable logistic regressions measured associations between PCMH experiences and receipt of depression<symptom> treatment in Y2 , accounting for treatment in Y1. Among those who did not receive depression<symptom> treatment in Y1 ( n = 4613) , positive experiences in three domains ( comprehensiveness , shared decision-making , self-management support) predicted greater initiation of treatment in Y2. Among those who received depression<symptom> treatment in Y1 ( n = 22,749) , positive or moderate experiences in four domains ( comprehensiveness , care coordination , medication decision-making , self-management support) predicted greater continuation of treatment in Y2. In a national PCMH setting , patient experiences with integrated care , including care coordination , comprehensiveness , involvement in shared decision-making , and self-management support predicted patients ' subsequent initiation and continuation of depression<symptom> treatment over time-a relationship that could affect physical and mental health outcomes.
