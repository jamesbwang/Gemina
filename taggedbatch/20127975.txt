 Deletions of proximal chromosome 3p13p14 are infrequent chromosomal alterations. Variable sizes and breakpoints have been reported in patients with a wide range of phenotypes that are evolving as additional cases are reported. The routine use of high-density chromosomal microarrays ( CMA) has allowed the identification of many more cases of this disorder and clinical phenotyping shows evidence for an emerging profile among patients with overlapping deletions of 3p13p14. Here , we review the currently reported cases , their phenotypes and where available , the genomic intervals delineated by CMA. Surprisingly , we found that a significant number of proximal chromosome 3p deletions involve structural rearrangements , especially insertions , that have been identified in balanced parental chromosome complements. This region is historically known as a common human chromosomal fragile site , although an underlying genomic mechanism related to its architecture has not been identified. We conclude that identification of an interstitial 3p deletion in a proband by CMA should prompt consideration of further structural chromosomal evaluation using more traditional cytogenetic techniques. While the variability in breakpoints does not suggest a unifying underlying mechanism for these alterations , identification of the haploinsufficient genes in each patient 's deletion interval and their developmental roles can guide genotype-phenotype correlations and impact clinical management.
