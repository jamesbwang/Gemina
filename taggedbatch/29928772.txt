 The impact of municipal waste on pathogenic micro-organisms released into the environment is a public health concern. This study aims to evaluate the effects of sewage sludge and antibiotic contaminants on stress response , virulence and antibiotic resistance in a pathogenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. The effects of sewage sludge leachates on uropathogenic E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> CFT073<pathogen> were determined by monitoring the expression of 45 genes associated with antibiotic/metal resistance , stress response and virulence using RT-qPCR. The E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> gene expression was validated using subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> exposed to sewage sludge or sewage sludge + fly ash leachates altered the expression of five antibiotic and metal resistance , three stress response and two virulence-associated genes. When antibiotics were combined with sludge or sludge + fly ash the antibiotic-associated gene expression was altered. E.<pathogen> coli treated with two sludge leachates had distinct gene expression patterns that were altered when the sludge leachates were combined with tetracycline , although to a lesser extent with ciprofloxacin. The E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> multigene expression analysis is a potential new tool for assessing the effects of pollutants on pathogenic microbes in environmental waters for improved risk assessment.
