 We investigated the role of nitric oxide ( NO) in the protective effects of remote ischemic per-conditioning ( rIPerC) on renal ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R) injury in male rats. I/R treatment consisted of 45 min bilateral renal artery ischemia and 24 hr reperfusion interval. rIPerC was performed using four cycles of 2 min occlusions of the left femoral artery and 3 min reperfusion at the beginning of renal ischemia. The animals were given normal saline ( vehicle) , NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester ( L-NAME) or L-arginine. Following the reperfusion period , renal functional- and oxidative stress- parameters , as well as histopathological changes were assessed. In comparison with the sham group , I/R resulted in renal dysfunction , as indicated by significantly lower creatinine clearance and higher fractional excretion of sodium. This went along with decreased glutathione peroxidase ( GPX) and catalase ( CAT) activity in the I/R group , increased malondialdehyde ( MDA) contents and histological damages. In comparison with the I/R group , the rIPerC group displayed improved renal function , increased activity of GPX and CAT enzymes , and decreased MDA level. However , these effects were abrogated by L-NAME injection and augmented by L-arginine treatment. According to the results , the functional and structural consequences of rIPerC against I/R-induced kidney dysfunction , which is associated with reduction of lipid peroxidation and intensification of anti-oxidant systems , is partially dependent on NO production.
