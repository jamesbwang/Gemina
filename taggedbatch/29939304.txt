 Quality of life ( QoL) is an important outcome in chronic kidney disease ( CKD). Patients feel that symptoms are an important determinant of QoL. However , this relation is unknown. The aims of this study were to investigate the impact of the number and severity of symptoms on QoL in elderly pre-dialysis patients , assessed by both the effect of symptoms and their importance relative to kidney function , and other clinical variables on QoL. The European Quality study ( EQUAL study) is an ongoing European prospective follow-up study in late Stage 4/5 CKD patients aged â‰¥ 65 years. We used patients included between March 2012 and December 2015. Patients scored their symptoms with the Dialysis Symptom Index , and QoL with the research and development-36 ( RAND-36) item Health Survey ( RAND-36). The RAND-36 results in a physical component summary ( PCS) and a mental component summary ( MCS). We used linear regression to estimate the relation between symptoms and QoL at baseline and after 6 months , and to calculate the variance in QoL explained by symptoms. The baseline questionnaire was filled in by 1079 ( 73 %) patients ( median age 75 years , 66 % male , 98 % Caucasian) , and the follow up questionnaire by 627 ( 42 %) patients. At baseline , every additional symptom changed MCS with -0.81 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): -0.91 to -0.71) and PCS with -0.50 ( 95 % CI: -0.62 to -0.39). In univariable analyses , number of symptoms explained 22 % of MCS variance and 11 % of PCS variance , whereas estimated glomerular filtration rate only explained 1 %. In elderly CKD Stage 4/5 patients , symptoms have a substantial impact on QoL. This indicates symptoms should have a more prominent role in clinical decision-making.
