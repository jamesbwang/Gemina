 Dignified care protects the patient 's rights and provides appropriate ethical care while improving the quality of nursing care. In this context , the opinions of nurses and patients who receive nursing care about dignified care are important. The aim of this study was to explore the opinions and experiences of Turkish patients and nurses about respectful care of human dignity. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Turkey. Participants were inpatients at cardiology , neurology and neurosurgery clinics and nurses working in these clinics. The data for the study were collected from face-to-face interviews using questionnaires. The percentages of characteristics and preferences of the participants were calculated , and the results were analysed using statistical tests. A total of 150 patients and 78 nurses participated in the study. The patients stated that the protection of their rights was the most important factor for dignified nursing care. The nurses stated that being careful to not expose the patients ' body and being respectful of the patients ' privacy were important in dignified nursing care. The age of the patient , duration of the disease , number of hospitalisations and length of time the nurses had been working at the clinic caused significant changes in the factors considered important in dignified care. Our findings provide a perspective on dignified care in the Turkish healthcare setting. There were some differences between patients and nurses in the factors considered important for dignified care. The discussion with patients and nurses related to care and practices that protect or detract from human dignity can provide insights to ethics.
