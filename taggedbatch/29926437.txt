 Type 1 neurofibromatosis ( NF 1) , a rare genetic disease with autosomal dominant transmission , has typical dermatologic manifestations with pathognomonic Lisch nodules<symptom> , and is rarely known for vascular alterations. Among these , aneurysmal dilatation is the most common form. We report a fatal case of massive hemothorax due to a spontaneous rupture of the left pulmonary artery branch micro-aneurysm in a NF 1 patient. Indeed , spontaneous rupture of these pathologic vessels is very rare in clinical practice and the literature , but , for its potentially life-threatening complications , there is the need for it to be taken into account in differential diagnosis. The origin of bleeding was first confirmed by computed tomography angiography ( CTA). The patient 's condition worsened suddenly leading to pulmonary<symptom> hemorrhage<symptom> and death. A clinical autopsy was required to assess the definitive cause of death.
