 The Northern California Current System experiences highly variable seasonal upwelling in addition to larger basin-scale variability , both of which can significantly affect its water chemistry. Salinity and temperature fields from a 7 year ROMS hindcast model of this region ( 43 ° N-50 ° N) , along with extensive particle tracking , were used to study interannual variability in water properties over both the upper slope and the midshelf bottom. Variation in slope water properties was an order of magnitude smaller than on the shelf. Furthermore , the primary relationship between temperature and salinity anomalies in midshelf bottom water consisted of variation in density ( cold/salty versus warm/fresh) , nearly orthogonal to the anomalies along density levels ( cold/fresh versus warm/salty) observed on the upper slope. These midshelf anomalies were well-explained (
