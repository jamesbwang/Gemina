 Drugs that enhance cholinergic transmission have demonstrated promise treating addictive disorders. Galantamine , an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor , may reduce cigarette smoking in otherwise healthy treatment-seeking smokers. The current study is a double-blind , placebo-controlled , study that randomized daily smokers ( n = 60) to receive one of two doses of galantamine extended release ( 8 or 16 mg/day) , or a placebo treatment. Participants completed a smoking choice task as well as study measures and cognitive tasks in the laboratory and daily life using ecological momentary assessment. Analysis focused on smoking behavior and satisfaction , cognitive performance , and decision to smoke prior to a quit attempt. Linear mixed models demonstrated that , compared with placebo , both doses of galantamine reduced smoking in a laboratory choice task ( p = 0.006) and decreased urine cotinine levels , but not self-reported cigarettes , during the pre-quit period ( p = 0.007). Treatment had minimal effect on smoking satisfaction or cognitive performance. The results suggest that galantamine reduces nicotine intake but it is unlikely that galantamine improves cognitive performance in otherwise healthy , treatment-seeking smokers. Larger randomized clinical trials can determine if galantamine adjunctive to addiction treatment can improve smoking treatment outcomes.
