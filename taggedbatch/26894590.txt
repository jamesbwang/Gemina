 Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) has heterogeneous clinical manifestations. IFIH1 ( interferon induced with helicase C domain 1) as one of antiviral helicase genes mediating type I interferon production , plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of SLE. The gene variants in IFIH1 could abnormally activate antiviral defenses and increased type I interferon signaling. The present study aimed to validate associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP) in IFIH1 and the pathogenesis of SLE. In total , rs1990760 , rs3747517 and rs10930046 in IFIH1 are genotyped in 400 SLE patients and 659 health controls in Chinese cohort by an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction ( iMLDR) technique. Significant associations were observed between alleles of IFIH1 ( rs1990760 C > T , P = 0.005 , OR = 1.36 , 95 % CI = 1.10-1.69; rs3747517 T > C , P = 0.004 , OR = 1.31 , 95 % CI = 1.09-1.58 , respectively) and SLE susceptibility. IFIH1 rs1990760 TT genotype carriers had lower serum levels of IL-18 ( P < 0.001) and granzyme B ( P < 0.001) than CC and CT genotype carriers. IFIH1 rs1990760 CT genotype carriers had higher anti-dsDNA-positive than CC and TT genotype carriers. In conclusion , IFIH1 polymorphisms ( rs1990760 and rs3747517) were associated with SLE susceptibility and rs1990760 risk T allele related with IL-18 and granzyme B serum levels in SLE patients.
