 Diverse marine fish and squid form symbiotic associations with extracellular bioluminescent bacteria. These symbionts are typically free-living bacteria with large genomes , but one known lineage of symbionts has undergone genomic reduction and evolution of host dependence. It is not known why distinct evolutionary trajectories have occurred among different luminous symbionts , and not all known lineages previously had genome sequences available. In order to better understand patterns of evolution across diverse bioluminescent symbionts , we
