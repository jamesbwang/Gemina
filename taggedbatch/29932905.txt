 Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2) maintains gene silencing by catalyzing methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 ( H3K27me2/3) within chromatin. By designing a system whereby PRC2-mediated repressive domains were collapsed and then reconstructed in an inducible fashion in vivo , a two-step mechanism of H3K27me2/3 domain formation became evident. First , PRC2 is stably recruited by the actions of JARID2 and MTF2 to a limited number of spatially interacting `` nucleation sites , '' creating H3K27me3-forming Polycomb foci within the nucleus. Second , PRC2 is allosterically activated via its binding to H3K27me3 and rapidly spreads H3K27me2/3 both in cis and in far-cis via long-range contacts. As PRC2 proceeds further from the nucleation sites , its stability on chromatin decreases such that domains of H3K27me3 remain proximal , and those of H3K27me2 distal , to the nucleation sites. This study demonstrates the principles of de novo establishment of PRC2-mediated repressive domains across the genome.
