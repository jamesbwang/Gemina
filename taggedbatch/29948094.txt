 Autologous fat grafting ( AFG; lipofilling , lipografting) has been used in delayed breast reconstruction. Recently , it has also been investigated as an alternative for immediate reconstruction in patients submitted to breast-conserving surgery ( BCS). Although good aesthetic results have been reported , the oncologic safety of the procedure remains under investigation. This article aims to assess oncologic outcomes of patients submitted to BCS with immediate AFG reconstruction. This study consisted of 65 patients undergoing BCS with AFG between January 2010 and January 2017. They were closely followed after surgery for a median period of 40.8 months. Locoregional and systemic recurrences were the primary endpoints of this study. Ten patients developed cancer recurrence ( 15.4 %). The median time for recurrence was 58.9 months. Only two patients presented locoregional recurrence ( LRR) ( 3.07 %). Five patients had systemic recurrence ( 7.69 %) , and three had both systemic and LRR ( 4.61 %). Median disease-free survival ( DFS) was 42.2 months , and overall survival ( OV) was 44.3 months. Recurrences were significantly associated with the number of metastatic axillary lymph nodes detected. Oncologic outcomes of immediate AFG are similar to the results previously reported in BCS without AFG. Locoregional and systemic recurrences are associated with the presence of axillary metastases.
