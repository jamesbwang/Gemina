 Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) of Toll-like receptors ( TLRs) have been associated with functional modification or impairment of cytokine responses. In chronic hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection , studies of TLR polymorphisms have primarily targeted receptor pathways implicated in viral immune responses. We hypothesized that one or more variant ( s) of TLR3 , TLR7 and TLR8 are associated with different outcomes of HCV<pathogen> infection. A total of 3368 subjects from 850 families were recruited and divided into three main groups categorized as chronic HCV<pathogen> ( CHCV) , spontaneous viral clearance ( SVC) , and controls. All individuals were genotyped for three SNPs for TLR3 , two SNPs for TLR7 , and two SNPs for TLR8 using allelic discrimination real-time PCR. Carriage of the C allele in three SNPs of TLR3 ( rs3775290 , rs3775291 , and rs5743312) , the C allele in TLR7 ( rs3853839) in females only , and the C allele in TLR8 ( rs3764879) in males only were significantly higher in SVC group than CHCV group ( P < 0.001) , while carriage of the T allele in TLR7 ( rs179008) in females only and the A allele in TLR8 ( rs3764880) in both males and females were significantly higher in CHCV infection more than SVC group ( P < 0.001). The C allele is protective of HCV<pathogen> in TLR3 , TLR7 ( rs3853839) in females only , and TLR8 ( rs3764879) in males only , while risk of infection is linked to the T allele in TLR7 ( rs179008) in females only and the A allele in TLR8 ( rs3764880) in both sexes.
