 To compare the efficacy of Lea symbols ( LS) chart and Sheridan Gardiner ( SG) chart for vision screening among preschool children , in a semi-urban district of South India. Vision screening was conducted among 260 preschool children aged 3-5 years in cluster sampled kindergartens using LS chart and SG chart. Pass/fail scores and time taken for visual acuity ( VA) estimation were compared. VA scores and time taken were compared using unpaired t-test. Sensitivity , specificity , and positive and negative predictive values were compared between the charts. There was a significant difference between LS and SG charts in the VA score in both the eyes ( P = 0.04). LS showed 76.09 % pass score and 23.90 % fail score , whereas SG showed 87.65 % pass score and 12.35 % fail score with a cutoff value of > 0.3 log MAR.. Time for screening using LS was higher , when compared to SG , both for the right eyes ( P < 0.001) and the left eyes ( P < 0.001). The sensitivity of the LS was 94.74 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 70.13 % -81.06 %) and that of SG was 52.63 % ( 95 % CI: 45.29 % -59.8 %). The specificity of LS was 66.67 % ( 95 % CI: 90.26 % -97.30 %) and SG was 83.33 % ( 95 % CI: 70.12 % -91.30 %). LS chart showed better sensitivity and negative predictive value when compared to SG chart. However , SG chart showed better specificity and positive predictive value , and screening was less time-consuming. Considering the high sensitivity and negative predictive value , LS is the preferred tool , when compared to SG chart in preschool vision screening in our population.
