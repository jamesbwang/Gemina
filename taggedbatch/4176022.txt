 Among the eight stereoisomers of phytanic acid ( PA) , the 3RS , 7R , 11R-isomer is naturally occurring and is present in foods and the human body. PA is considered to have possible health benefits in the immune system. However , it remains undetermined whether these effects are elicited by the 3RS , 7R , 11R-PA isomer , because previous studies used a commercially available PA whose isomer configuration is unknown. In this study , we synthesized a preparation of 3RS , 7R , 11R-PA , and investigated its in vitro immunomodulatory effects , especially the T-cell production of interferon ( IFN)- γ , which is associated with various autoimmune diseases. This study also investigated the effects of 3RS , 7R , 11R-PA on NF-κB activity in order to address the mechanism of its immunomodulatory effects. Mouse splenocytes and purified T-cells were stimulated with T-cell mitogens and incubated with 3RS , 7R , 11R-PA , followed by evaluation of IFN-γ production. The effect of 3RS , 7R , 11R-PA on NF-κB activity was also investigated using an A549 cell line with stable expression of an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene. 3RS , 7R , 11R-PA significantly reduced in vitro IFN-γ production at both the protein and mRNA levels , and was accompanied by decreased expression of T-bet , a key regulator of Th1 cell differentiation. The results indicated that NF-κB-mediated transcriptional activity was significantly decreased by 3RS , 7R , 11R-PA and that GW6471 , an antagonist of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α ( PPARα) , abrogated the inhibitory effect of 3RS , 7R , 11R-PA on NF-κB activity. The present study suggests that 3RS , 7R , 11R-PA is a functional and bioactive fatty acid , and has a potentially beneficial effect for amelioration of T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases. This study also indicates that interference in the NF-κB pathway via PPARα activation is a potential mechanism of the immunomodulatory effects of 3RS , 7R , 11R-PA.
