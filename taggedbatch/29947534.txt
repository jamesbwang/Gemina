 We examined the upregulation of ET-1/ ETBR/eNOS signaling in renoprotective effect of vitamin D in kidney fibrosis<disease> model in mice using unilateral ureteral obstruction ( UUO). One group was treated with intraperitoneal injection of 0.125 mg/kg of Calcitriol ( UUO+VD). Vascular remodeling was quantified based on lumen area and lumen/wall area ratio ( LWAR) of intrarenal arteries using Sirius Red staining. ET-1 , ETBR , eNOS , CD31 and VEGF mRNA expressions were quantified using qRT-PCR. Focusing on endothelin-1 ( ET-1) signaling in endothelial cells ( EC) , siRNA of ET-1 was performed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC) for reducing ET-1 expression. Then HUVECs were treated with and without 100 nM Calcitriol treatment in hypoxic and normoxic conditions to elucidate ET-1/ eNOS signaling. Our in vivo study revealed vascular remodeling and renal ischemia attenuation after Calcitriol treatment. Vascular remodeling was attenuated in the UUO+VD group as shown by increasing lumen areas and LWAR in intrarenal arteries. These findings were associated with significant higher CD31 and VEGF mRNA expression compared to the UUO group. Vitamin D treatment also increased ET-1 , ETBR and eNOS mRNA expressions. Our in vitro study demonstrated Calcitriol induced ET-1 and eNOS mRNA expressions upregulation in HUVEC under normoxic and hypoxic condition. Meanwhile , siRNA for ET-1 inhibited the upregulation of eNOS mRNA expression after Calcitriol treatment. Vitamin D ameliorates kidney fibrosis<disease> through attenuating vascular remodeling and ischemia with upregulating ET-1/ ETBR and eNOS expression.
