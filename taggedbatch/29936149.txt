 Type-2 diabetes mellitus ( DM) is associated with cognitive impairment. Increasing evidence establishes that neuro-inflammatory and oxidative stress condition plays a main role in the development of neurodegeneration. Epalrestat , an aldose reductase inhibitor is commonly prescribed for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Its beneficial effects for antioxidant , anti-inflammatory potential and being rhodanine structure containing compound suggests possible role for treatment of DM associated with cognitive dysfunction. In the present study , we evaluated the effect of epalrestat ( 54 , 27 , 13.5 mg/kg , p.o.) and donepezil ( 1 mg/kg , p.o.) on Tau protein levels , oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in high fat diet ( HFD) and Streptozotocin ( STZ; 35 mg/kg , i.p.) induced cognitive impairment in diabetic rats. The epalrestat- 54 , 27 mg/kg p.o. and donepezil treatment significantly increased CAT ( p < 0.001 , p < 0.01 , p < 0.001) and GSH ( p < 0.001 , p < 0.01 , p < 0.001) activities respectively as compared to diabetic control rats. In addition , similar dose of epalrestat treatment indicated considerably lowered TAU protein levels ( p < 0.001 , p < 0.05) while no significant effect was noted with donepezil. These treatments significantly decreased gene expression of TNF-Î± ( 1.6 , 1.6 , 1.7 fold change) and IL-6 ( 2.5 , 1.9 , 1.7 fold change). Histopathological examination indicated that epalrestat could attenuate apoptosis of neurons , vacuolations and clumped processes , disorganization and thinning of all the layers. Our findings suggest that diabetic rats treated with epalrestat could ameliorate the cognition deficits and might act as a beneficial agent for prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment in diabetes.
