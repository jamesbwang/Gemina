 Minimally-invasive optical imaging requires that light is delivered efficiently to limit the detrimental impact of photodamage on delicate biological systems. Light sheet microscopy represents the exemplar in tissue specific optical imaging of small and mesoscopic samples alike. However , further gains towards gentler imaging require a more selective imaging strategy to limit exposure to multiple yet discrete tissues without overexposing the sample , particularly where the information content is sparse or particularly optically sensitive tissues are present. The development of sample-adaptive imaging techniques is crucial in pursuit of the next generation of smart , autonomous microscopes. Herein , we report a microscope capable of performing 4D ( x , y , z , t) light patterning to selectively illuminate multiple , rapidly reconfigurable regions of interest while maintaining the rapid imaging speed and high contrast associated with light sheet microscopy. We illustrate this utility in living zebrafish larvae and phantom samples.
