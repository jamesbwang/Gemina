 Cytokines produced by various cells are strong local mediators of inflammation<symptom>. Interleukin-1beta ( IL-1β) and C-reactive protein ( CRP) play essential roles in the development and progression of diabetes mellitus ( DM). Thus periodontal<disease> diseases<disease> could be related to DM via the same mediators of inflammation<symptom>. To evaluate plasma and gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF) levels of IL-1β and CRP in adolescents with DM to further investigate whether DM has an impact on the levels of inflammation<symptom> factors at an early stage , and to analyze the risk of developing periodontal<disease> diseases<disease> in adolescents with DM. A total of 121 adolescents aged from ten to sixteen years were enrolled , 41 adolescents diagnosed with diabetes mellitus were collected in the DM group , and 80 nondiabetic adolescents as the control group. The periodontal indices of each individual were recorded , including plaque index ( PLI) , modified bleeding index ( mBI) , probing depth ( PD) and attachment loss ( AL). GCF and intravenous blood samples were collected , and CRP and IL-1β levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). ( 1) PLI of DM group and control group were 1.23 ± 0.05 and 0.95 ± 0.04 separately , with significant difference ( P = 0.001). DM group and control group had mBI of 0.80 ± 0.08 and 0.51 ± 0.06 separately , with significant difference ( P = 0.003). Attachment loss was found in none of the subjects. PDs of DM group and control group were ( 2.37 ± 0.51) mm and ( 2.31 ± 0.05) mm separately , and there was no significant difference. ( 2) CRP in GCF was only detectable in partial of the individuals , with a detectable rate of 22.9 % ( 11/48) in total. The detectable rate of CRP in GCF was significantly higher in DM group ( 38.5 %) than that in control group ( 4.5 % , P = 0.006). The plasma level of CRP in DM group ( 0.23 ( 0.15 , 1.89) mg/L) was higher than that in control group ( 0.19 ( 0.12 , 4.18) mg/L) , but without significance ( P = 0.776). ( 3) The plasma levels of IL-1β in DM group and control group were ( 14.11 ± 0.57) ng/L and ( 14.71 ± 0.50) ng/L separately , but there was no significance ( P = 0.456). GCF levels of IL-1β in DM group and control group were ( 12.91 ± 1.95) μg/L and ( 17.68 ± 3.07) μg/L , without significant difference ( P = 0.185). Periodontitis<disease> was not observed in adolescents with DM at an early stage. However , the rising levels of periodontal indices and CRP in GCF , might indicate that adolescents with DM have a higher risk of developing periodontal<disease> diseases<disease> in the future.
