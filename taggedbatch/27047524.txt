 The chloroplast genome of Tetragonia tetragonioides ( Aizoaceae; Caryophyllales) was sequenced to provide information for studies on phylogeny and evolution within Caryophyllales. The chloroplast genome of Tetragonia tetragonioides is 149,506 bp in length and includes a pair of inverted repeats ( IRs) of 24,769 bp that separate a large single copy ( LSC) region of 82,780 bp and a small single copy ( SSC) region of 17,188 bp. Comparative analysis of the chloroplast genome showed that Caryphyllales species have lost many genes. In particular , the rpl2 intron and infA gene were not found in T. tetragonioides , and core Caryophyllales lack the rpl2 intron. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using 55 genes in 16 complete chloroplast genomes. Caryophyllales was found to divide into two clades; core Caryophyllales and noncore Caryophyllales. The genus Tetragonia is closely related to Mesembryanthemum. Comparisons of the synonymous ( Ks) , nonsynonymous ( Ka) , and Ka/Ks substitution rates revealed that nonsynonymous substitution rates were lower than synonymous substitution rates and that Ka/Ks rates were less than 1. The findings of the present study suggest that most genes are a purified selection.
