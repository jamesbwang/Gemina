 We describe the long-term results of partial atrioventricular septal defect ( AVSD) repair in a single centre encompassing a 22-year period. Described are rates of survival , reoperation and complications. We performed a retrospective review of 556 patients undergoing AVSD repair to identify the 51 patients who underwent partial AVSD repair in Our Lady 's Children 's Hospital , Crumlin , Ireland , between 1993 and 2015 with long-term follow-up where available. A total of 29 ( 56.8 %) of patients were male and mean age at operation was 3.32 years. Mean weight was 13.2 kg. Trisomy 21 was present in 29 ( 56.8 %). Five patients ( 9.6 %) had undergone prior surgery. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 89 ± 36 min and mean aortic cross-clamp time was 57 ± 28 min. One patient underwent partial AVSD repair and concomitant tracheal resection and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation decannulation. One patient was managed with suture atrial septal defect ( ASD) closure , the remainder with patch repair of ASD and mitral cleft closure. The length of hospital stay was 9 ± 5 days. Median follow-up was 6.06 years ( IQR , 1.65-10.2 years). There were no early mortalities. One patient died 1 year following surgery ( 1.9 %). One patient required reoperation at an interval of 2 years for severe mitral regurgitation ( 1.9 %). Short- and long-term survival following partial AVSD repair in Ireland revealed excellent results compared with other published series. Reoperation incidence also compared excellently with other reports published in the literature.
