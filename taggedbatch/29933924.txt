 To identify determinants of older patients ' perceptions of involvement in decision-making on colorectal ( CRC) or pancreatic cancer ( PC) treatment , and to compare these with determinants of observers ' perceptions. Patients ' perceptions of involvement were constructed by the 9-item SDM questionnaire ( SDM-Q-9) and a Visual Analogue Scale for Involvement ( VAS-I). Observers ' perceptions were constructed by the OPTION5 , OPTION12 , and MAPPIN ` SDM. Convergent validities were calculated between the patient-sided and observer instruments using Spearman 's correlation coefficient. Linear regression was used to identify determinants per criterion. 58 CRC and 22 PC patients were included ( mean age: 71.8 Â± 5.2 years , 45.0 % female). No significant correlations were found between the patient-sided and observer instruments. Patients ' impression of involvement was influenced by patient characteristics such as quality of life and satisfaction , while observers ' perceptions mainly referred to encounter characteristics such as the mean duration of consultations and general communication skills. Due to evident differences in determinants , older CRC/PC patients ' and observers ' perceptions of involvement should both be collected in evaluating the quality of medical decision-making. General communication skills should be integrated in SDM training interventions. New SDM measurement tools for patients are needed to sufficiently discriminate between the constructs of involvement and satisfaction.
