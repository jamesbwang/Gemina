 The unit describes protocols for isolating and characterizing extracellular vesicles ( EVs) derived from human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs). EVs are a mixed population of membrane-surrounded structures with overlapping composition and size. Advances made in recent years have led to a better understanding of the biological role of EVs. In particular , they can be considered key factors responsible for MSC-paracrine activity , mediating their anti-inflammatory effects towards innate immune cells , such as macrophages. The topics comprise description of the MSC-conditioned medium containing vesicles preparation , EV isolation , and characterization mainly by specifically set up flow cytometry and electron microscopy approaches , and in vitro methodologies involved in testing the EV anti-inflammatory capacity. The procedures described here can be easily reproduced and can be employed regardless of the type of progenitor cells used to secrete EVs. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
