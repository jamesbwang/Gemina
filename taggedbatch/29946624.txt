 We present a microfluidic nozzle device for the controlled continuous solution blow spinning of ultrafine fibers. The device is fabricated by soft lithography techniques and is based on the principle of a gas dynamic virtual nozzle for precise three-dimensional gas focusing of the spinning solution. Uniform fibers with virtually endless length can be produced in a continuous process while having accurate control over the fiber diameter. The nozzle device is used to produce ultrafine fibers of perfluorinated copolymers and of polycaprolactone , which are collected and drawn on a rotating cylinder. Hydrodynamics and mass balance<symptom> quantitatively predict the fiber diameter , which is only a function of flow rate and air pressure , with a small correction accounting for viscous dissipation during jet formation , which slightly reduces the jet velocity. Because of the simplicity of the setup , the precise control of the fiber diameter , the positional stability of the exiting ultrafine fiber and the potential to implement arrays of parallel channels for high throughput , this methodology offers significant benefits compared to existing solution-based fiber production methods.
