 Linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis is a rare autoimmune disease that usually has an excellent prognosis in childhood; however , its control is more difficult in adults. It presents heterogeneous clinical manifestations and is frequently confused with other bullous diseases such as bullous pemphigoid and Duhring 's dermatitis<disease> herpetiformis. Dermatologists ' awareness of this disease contributes to early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. We thus report three cases of linear immunoglobulin A dermatosis in adults.
