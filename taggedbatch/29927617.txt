 The specific influence of preoperative and postoperative radiographic measurements on patient-reported outcome measures after hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement ( FAI) remains unclear. To investigate the relationship between radiographic measurements and 2-year outcomes after hip arthroscopy for the treatment of FAI. Case series; Level of evidence , 4. A clinical registry of patients undergoing primary hip arthroscopy for FAI between January 1 , 2012 , and December 31 , 2014 , was queried. Outcome measures included the Hip Outcome Score ( HOS) Activities of Daily Living ( ADL) , HOS Sport-Specific Subscale ( SSS) , modified Harris Hip Score ( mHHS) , and visual analog scale ( VAS) for pain and satisfaction. Preoperative and postoperative radiographic measurements were recorded. Univariate analysis was conducted to identify relationships between all radiographic and demographic variables and outcome scores. A multivariate regression analysis , controlling for demographic factors , was used to identify independent associations between radiographic measurements on plain radiographs and patient-reported outcomes. The authors identified 707 patients who underwent primary hip arthroscopic management for FAI who were included for analysis. Two-year outcome surveys were completed for 78 % to 84 % of patients. The mean age of the patients was 33.2 ± 12.3 years , and 64.4 % of the patients ( n = 456) were female. The mean anteroposterior ( AP) alpha angle decreased by 34.3 ° ( P < .0001) , false profile alpha angle by 25.2 ° ( P < .0001) , Dunn lateral alpha angle by 28.9 ° ( P < .0001) , lateral center edge angle by 2.6 ° ( P < .0001) , and anterior center edge angle by 3.4 ° ( P < .0001). The HOS-ADL score increased from 65.7 ± 18.7 preoperatively to 85.9 ± 16.7 postoperatively ( P < .0001) , HOS-SSS increased from 43.4 ± 23.1 to 72.6 ± 27.2 ( P < .0001) , and mHHS increased from 57.7 ± 14.0 to 79.1 ± 17.2 ( P < .0001). With multivariate analysis , independent predictors of the postoperative HOS-ADL score included the preoperative false profile alpha angle ( beta = -0.16 , P = .028). Independent predictors of HOS-SSS score were preoperative AP alpha angle ( beta = -0.33 , P = .032) and preoperative false profile alpha angle ( beta = -0.28 , P = .041). For the postoperative mHHS score , independent predictors included preoperative AP alpha angle ( beta = -0.18 , P = .046) , preoperative false profile alpha angle ( beta = -0.20 , P = .014) , and postoperative false profile alpha angle ( beta = -0.48 , P = .035). The preoperative AP alpha angle ( beta = 0.28 , P = .024) was a significant predictor for the postoperative VAS pain score. The preoperative false profile alpha angle ( beta = -0.34 , P = .040) was a significant predictor for the postoperative VAS satisfaction score. The authors observed that radiographic measurements , specifically the preoperative false profile alpha angle , AP alpha angle , and postoperative false profile alpha angle , are independent predictors of 2-year clinical outcomes. The femoral-side measurements were the strongest independent predictors of outcomes , especially measurements of the anterior and lateral-based CAM lesion<symptom>.
