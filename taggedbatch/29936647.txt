 Bacteria of the Arcobacter<pathogen> ( A.) genus , originating mainly from food and water , are dreaded germs for humans as well as animals. However , the virulence of these bacteria has not been fully elucidated yet. This study looked at the occurrence of eight virulence-associated factors ( ciaB , cj1349 , pldA , irgA , hecA , tlyA , mviN , hecB) in a total of 80 isolates of Arcobacter<pathogen> butzleri<pathogen> and 22 isolates of A.<pathogen> cryaerophilus<pathogen>. The isolates were derived from food , water , and clinical samples. A polymerase chain reaction using specific primers was used to detect these virulence-associated genes. The presence of all genes in the isolates of A.<pathogen> butzleri<pathogen> ( 98.8 % ciaB , 95.0 % cj1349 , 98.8 % pldA , 22.5 % irgA , 31.3 % hecA , 95.0 % tlyA , 97.5 % mviN , 38.8 % hecB) and A.<pathogen> cryaerophilus<pathogen> ( 95.5 % ciaB , 0.0 % cj1349 , 9.1 % pldA , 0.0 % irgA , 0.0 % hecA , 31.8 % tlyA , 90.9 % mviN , 0.0 % hecB) was monitored. Among the tested isolates , there were 13 isolates ( 12.7 %) of A.<pathogen> butzleri<pathogen> , in which the presence of all eight virulence-associated genes was recorded in the genome. In contrast , in one A.<pathogen> cryaerophilus<pathogen> strain , none of the observed genes were detected. The presence of ciaB and mviN genes was significantly more frequent in A.<pathogen> cryaerophilus<pathogen> isolates than other genes ( P < 0.05). In general , more virulence-associated genes have been detected in A.<pathogen> butzleri<pathogen> isolates compared to A.<pathogen> cryaerophilus<pathogen>. The most common gene combination ( ciaB , cj1349 , pldA , tlyA , mviN) was detected in case of 39 isolates. In 50.0 % of A.<pathogen> butzleri<pathogen> isolates derived from clinical samples , all eight virulence-associated genes were significantly more frequently detected ( P < 0.05). The tlyA gene occurred significantly more frequent in A.<pathogen> butzleri<pathogen> isolates from meat and water samples and irgA and hecB genes in clinical samples. Therefore , our study provides information about occurrence of virulence-associated genes in genome of Arcobacter<pathogen> isolates. These findings could be hazardous to human health , because the presence of virulence-associated genes is the assumption for potential dangerousness of these bacteria. Our results indicate high incidence of virulence-associated genes in Arcobacter genomes and hence potentially pathogenic properties of the studied strains.
