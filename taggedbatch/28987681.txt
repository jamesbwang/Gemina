 Patients with psychiatric conditions are often referred for a brain scan during the course of their diagnostic workup. The aim of our study is to determine frequency and type of organic brain pathology , the relationship to age , gender and psychiatric diagnosis. We investigated magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography brain scans from consecutively referred patients over a 10-year period ( January 2002-December 2011). The reasons for referral , estimated psychiatric diagnosis , and the pathology discovered for each patient were registered. A total of 34 % of patients demonstrated organic brain pathology , of which 32.8 % were considered clinically relevant. This represents a higher frequency of relevant pathology than reported in healthy subjects. Age ( Brain imaging in clinical psychiatry resulted in approximately 30 % positive findings mainly associated with increasing pathologies with age , but also with diagnosis.
