 In 2012 , The Danish Society of Respiratory Medicine gave birth to their most recent guideline regarding chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). Much has happened since , and in late 2017 an update has been published. Chapters have been deleted , and new ones added. The major alteration has been in the section concerning treatment with inhalation medication- now aiming at an easy stepwise up-titration of long-acting medicine as well as a guide of how to down-titrate inhaled corticosteroids. This review mainly focuses on how to treat stable COPD according to The Danish Society of Respiratory Medicine.
