 For time-to-event data , the study sample is commonly selected using the nested case-control design in which controls are selected at the event time of each case. An alternative sampling strategy is to sample all controls at the same ( pre-specified) time , which can either be at the last event time or further out in time. Such controls are the long-term survivors and may therefore constitute a more ` extreme ' comparison group and be more informative than controls from the nested case-control design. We investigate this potential information gain by comparing the power of various ` extreme ' case-control designs with that of the nested case-control design using simulation studies. We derive an expression for the theoretical average information in a nested and extreme case-control pair for the situation of a single binary exposure. Comparisons reveal that the efficiency of the extreme case-control design increases when the controls are sampled further out in time. In an application to a study of dementia , we identified Apolipoprotein E as a risk factor using a 1:1 extreme case-control design , which provided a hazard ratio estimate with a smaller standard error than that of a 2:1 nested case-control design.
