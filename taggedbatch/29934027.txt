 To evaluate the visual outcomes , the incidence of glistenings and posterior capsule opacification in a series of consecutive eyes with a new blue light-filtering hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens ( IOL) SETTING: Service d'ophtalmologie , clinique Beausoleil , avenue de Lodève , Montpellier. Retrospective , cross-sectional study. This study included a series of 66 eyes that underwent routine cataract surgery with PODEye ( PhysIOL SA , Liège , Belgium) monofocal IOL implantation between May 2011 and November 2011. These eyes were compared for glistenings with patients implanted with Acrysof material IOL ( Alcon , Fort Worth , USA) who had a routine postoperative examination between January 2015 and August 2015. The safety of the IOL was assessed by visual acuity outcomes , as well as rotational stability , centration and postoperative medication. The incidence and severity of glistenings were evaluated with the slit lamp. Glistenings and PCO were graded subjectively ( 0 = absent; 1 = moderate; 2 = dense). Follow-up was 3 years. The mean visual acuity after PODEye implantation was 0.98 ± 0.05 ( n = 50) in decimal notation at 1 year , 0.98 ± 0.06 at 1 week , ( n = 66) , 1.00 ± 0.01 at 3 weeks ( n = 64) and 0.99 ± 0.02 at 3 months ( n = 59). The IOL displayed stable positioning in all axes. Glistenings of grade 2 were absent in the G-Free/PODEye group , whereas they were significantly present in the Acrysof group. One out of 43 eyes at 3-year follow-up underwent YAG capulotomy at 37 months. Sixty-six percent of eyes had no PCO ( grade 0) at 3 years. The PODEye IOL was safe and stable. Glistenings grade 2 or more were not found with this blue light-filtering hydrophobic acrylic IOL. PCO occurrence was low at three years.
