 Childhood traumatic experiences can disrupt attachment , influence personality development , and precipitate chronic<disease> disease<disease>. Although the repercussions of these experiences may also pose a barrier to healthcare , few studies have examined the association between childhood trauma and access to healthcare. Therefore , we sought to investigate whether a history of childhood trauma is associated with self-reported inability to access hospital care among persons who inject drugs ( PWID). Data were derived from two prospective cohorts of PWID in Vancouver , Canada. We used multivariable generalized estimating equations to examine associations between five types of childhood trauma and self-reported inability to access hospital care , both overall and specifically due to perceived mistreatment by hospital staff. In total , 300 participants ( 18.3 %) reported having tried but being unable to access hospital care in the previous 6 months at some point during the study period; the primary reason was perceived mistreatment by hospital staff ( 32.1 %). In multivariable analyses , childhood emotional abuse was independently associated with self-reported inability to access hospital care , adjusted odds ratio ( AOR) = 1.51 , 95 % CI ( 1.03 , 2.20). Childhood physical neglect was also independently associated with inability to access care due to perceived mistreatment by hospital staff , AOR = 1.80 , 95 % CI ( 1.11 , 2.93). This suggests potentially damaging consequences of early trauma in adult PWID populations. Further , this study emphasizes the need for trauma-informed models of care as well as the need to improve therapeutic alliances with survivors of childhood trauma in the PWID population.
