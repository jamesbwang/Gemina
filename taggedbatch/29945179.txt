 Although the extremely thermophilic archaea ( Topt ≥ 70 °C) may be the most primitive extant forms of life , they have been studied to a limited extent relative to mesophilic microorganisms. Many of these organisms have unique biochemical and physiological characteristics with important biotechnological implications. These include methanogens that generate methane , fermentative anaerobes that produce hydrogen gas with high efficiency , and acidophiles that can mobilize base , precious and strategic metals from mineral ores. Extremely thermophilic archaea also have been a valuable source of thermoactive , thermostable biocatalysts , but their use as cellular systems has been limited because of the general lack of facile genetics tools. This situation has changed recently , however , thereby providing an important avenue for understanding their metabolic and physiological details and also opening up opportunities for metabolic engineering efforts. Along these lines , extreme thermophilic archaea have recently been engineered to produce a variety of alcohols and industrial chemicals , in some cases incorporating CO2 into the final product. There are barriers and challenges to them reaching their full potential as industrial microorganisms but , if these can be overcome , a new dimension for biotechnology will be forthcoming that strategically exploits biology at high temperatures.
