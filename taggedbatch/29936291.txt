 By measuring the change in soil protist communities , the effect of human land use on grasslands can be monitored to promote sustainable ecosystem functioning. Protists form the active link in the rhizosphere between the plant roots and higher trophic organisms; however , only few morphological species and their ecological values have yet been described in this context. To investigate the communicability between morphological and molecular databases used in the molecular barcoding of protists and in the biomonitoring of grassland soil , the present high-throughput sequencing ( HTS) study ( N = 150) covered the area of central Europe ( mesoscale) known to be well studied for ciliated protists. HTS delivered 2,404 unique reads identifying taxa in all major ciliophoran classes but exact reference matches were few. The study identified clear discrepancies between databases for well-studied taxa , where molecular databases contained multiple gene variants for single morphospecies of dominant taxa. Gene variants presented own biogeography- the eukaryotic microdiversity along gradients ( e.g. , land-use intensity , soil water). It is possible that many of the so called novel phylogenetic lineages and hidden diversity pointed out in environmental surveys could be evidence for the severe lack of molecular data for already known and morphologically described species , present in morphological databases.
