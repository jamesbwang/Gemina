 The piracetam analog , aniracetam , has recently received attention for its cognition enhancing potential , with minimal reported side effects. Previous studies report the drug to be effective in both human and non-human models with pre-existing cognitive dysfunction , but few studies have evaluated its efficacy in healthy subjects. A previous study performed in our laboratory found no cognitive enhancing effects of oral aniracetam administration 1-hour prior to behavioral testing in naïve C57BL/6J mice. The current study aims to further evaluate this drug by administration of aniracetam 30 minutes prior to testing in order to optimize any cognitive enhancing effects. In this study , all naïve C57BL/6J mice were tested in tasks of delayed fear conditioning , novel object recognition , rotarod , open field , elevated plus maze , and marble burying. Across all tasks , animals in the treatment group failed to show enhanced learning when compared to controls. These results provide further evidence suggesting that aniracetam conveys no therapeutic benefit to subjects without pre-existing cognitive dysfunction.
