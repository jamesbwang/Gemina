 This work describes a small-scale production of iodine-124 using a 16.5 MeV cyclotron , and a subsequent validation of the formulated sodium ( 124I) iodide solution for routinely clinical applications. Iodine-124 ( Good result was achieved using a beam degradation foil of 500 µm thickness in combination with beam currents between 10 and 15 µA. Under these conditions , up to 150 MBq no-carrier-added ( Through the optimized conditions for irradiation and extraction , iodine-124 was produced in good radiochemical yields and high radionuclide purity. The generated injectable (
