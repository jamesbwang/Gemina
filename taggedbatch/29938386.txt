 Axonal outgrowth and guidance require numerous extracellular cues and intracellular mediators that transduce signals in the growth cone to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics. However , the way in which cytoskeletal effectors respond to these signals remains elusive. Here , we demonstrate that Porf-2 , a neuron-expressed RhoGTPase-activating protein , plays an essential role in the inhibition of initial axon growth by restricting the expansion of the growth cone in a cell-autonomous manner. Furthermore , the EphB1 receptor is identified as an upstream controller that binds and regulates Porf-2 specifically upon extracellular ephrin-B stimulation. The activated EphB forward signal deactivates Rac1 through the GAP domain of Porf-2 , which inhibits growth cone formation and brakes axon growth. Our results therefore provide a novel GAP that regulates axon growth and braking sequentially through Eph receptor-independent and Eph receptor-dependent pathways.
