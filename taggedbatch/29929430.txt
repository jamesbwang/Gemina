 This study investigated the dynamic relationship between multidimensional intergenerational instrumental support and health over time. This approach is of theoretical , methodological , and practical significance in gerontological research. Data came from The Well-Being of Older People in Anhui Province in 2001 , 2003 , 2006 , 2009 , and 2012. Of the 1,636 participants at baseline , a working sample of 1,557 older adults was used. Trajectories and correlated change were estimated using parallel latent growth curve modeling with maximum likelihood estimation. `` Received household-chore help '' decreased over time , whereas `` received personal-care help '' increased over time. `` Provided household-chore help '' and `` provided personal-care help '' increased and then decreased over time. Increasing receipt of `` household-chore help '' and `` personal-care help '' were associated with faster decline in health over time. Discussion Findings suggest distinctive patterns of changes for different dimensions of intergenerational instrumental support and their relationship with changes in perception of health over time in later life.
