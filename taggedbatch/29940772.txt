 Natural killer ( NK) cell-based immunotherapy is promising , as NK cells are in the first line of defense against cancer and capital of lysing tumor cells without pre-stimulation. However , NK cells from multiple myeloma ( MM) patients are always deficient in numbers and the expression of certain activating receptors , disabling them in cytotoxicity against the cancer. Therefore , effective strategies to expand NK cells and increase NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against MM are significant. Here , NK cells were efficiently expanded from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) of newly diagnosed MM patients after co-culture with irradiated K562 cells transfected with 41BBL and membrane-bound interleukin ( IL) -15 ( K562-mb15-41BBL) in the presence of 200 IU/ml human IL-2. The ex vivo-expanded NK cells were demonstrated to vigorously kill both MM cells and autologous primary MM cells without significant lysis of patient normal cells. Further exploration revealed a significant increase in cell surface expression of most activating receptors of NK cells and indicated that expanded NK ( exp-NK) cell killing of MM cells was mediated by perforin/granzyme. NK cells are capital of lysing human leukocyte antigen ( HLA) I-deficient tumor cells and carfizomib , a selective proteasome inhibitor approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MM patient , down-regulates the expression of HLA class I , thus enhancing NK cell-mediated lysis in MM. Here , we found for the first time that carfizomib dramatically augmented ex vivo exp-NK cell cytotoxicity against patient autologous MM cells , suggesting the use of exp-NK alone or in combination with the drug to treat MM patient.
