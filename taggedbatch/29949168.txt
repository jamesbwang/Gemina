 The morbidity of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) is 1 % -2 % in clinic. Radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA) is a type of radical interventional therapy for AF , whereas it may lead to a hypercoagulable state. This study evaluated platelet particle CD62P and platelet activation biomarker GP IIb/IIIa expressions in AF patients treated by RFCA , and aimed to analyze their relationships with the hypercoagulable state after RFCA. A total of 60 AF patients received RFCA in our hospital were enrolled. The patients were divided into group A as hypercoagulable state group and group B as non-hypercoagulable group. Healthy volunteers were selected as normal control. Serum D-Dimer , parathyroid activity index 1 ( PAI-1) , and tissue plasminogen activator ( t-PA) content were tested by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) , while peripheral CD62P and GP IIb/IIIa expressions were detected by using flow cytometry before , after , and seven days after RFCA. D-Dimer and PAI-1 levels increased , while t-PA reduced in group A compared with that in group B and control ( p < 0.05). D-Dimer and t-PA contents gradually elevated , whereas t-PA level gradually declined in group A before , after , and seven days after RFCA ( p < 0.05). Serum CD62P and GP IIb/IIIa expressions in group A were significantly higher compared to that in group B and control ( p < 0.05). CD62P and GP IIb/IIIa levels were significantly higher seven days after RFCA compared with immediate after RFCA in group A ( p < 0.05). CD62P showed a positive correlation with GP IIb/IIIa in hypercoagulable state patients after RFCA ( p < 0.05). AF patient may appear in hypercoagulable state after RFCA. CD62P and GP IIb/IIIa significantly increased and exhibited a positive correlation.
