 The new eighth edition TNM classification by the AJCC for breast cancer ( BC) incorporates biologic factors and gene expression prognostic panels , in addition to traditional anatomic factors. In this study , we evaluated the prognostic value of this new staging system compared to the previous AJCC 7th edition staging system. We conducted a retrospective analysis of women with stage I , II , or III BC who underwent curative surgery with/without adjuvant systemic therapy at Samsung Medical Center between July 2004 and December 2008. Of 3,208 BCs , this study was analyzed using the information of 2,790 BC patients. Hormone receptor-positive ( HR +) and human epidermal growth factor 2 ( HER2)- BCs were observed in 62.9 % of BCs , HR +/ HER2 + in 9.3 % , HR-/ HER2- in 17.0 % , and HR-/ HER2 + in 10.8 %. In survival analysis , we observed 245 distant recurrences and 198 deaths caused by BC progression. The median follow-up duration was 116.2 months. 10-year disease-specific survival ( DSS) rates according to the AJCC 7th edition criteria were 97.2 % of stage IA , 100 % of IB , 94.9 % of IIA , 87.9 % of IIB , 86.4 % of IIIA , 95.7 % of IIIB , and 65.7 % of IIIC ( p < 0.001). After applying 8th edition criteria , the 10-year DSS rates were 98.1 % of stage IA , 97.7 % of IB , 93.8 % of IIA , 92.7 % of IIB , 88.2 % of IIIA , 80.8 % of IIIB , and 70.3 % of IIIC ( p < 0.001). The AJCC 8th edition clinical staging system provides a good prognostic value and addresses the weakness<symptom> of the AJCC 7th edition , which uses only anatomical pathologic staging.
