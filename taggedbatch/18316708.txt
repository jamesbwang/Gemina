 Surgical brain injury may result in irreversible neurological deficits. Our previous report showed that partial regeneration of a traumatic brain lesion<symptom> is achieved by implantation of collagen glycosaminoglycan ( CGM). Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs) may play an important role in neurogenesis but there is currently a lack of studies displaying the relationship between the stimulation of MMPs and neurogenesis after collagen glycosaminoglycan implantation following surgical brain trauma. The present study was carried out to further examine the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 after implantation of collagen glycosaminoglycan ( CGM) following surgical brain trauma. Using the animal model of surgically induced brain lesion<symptom> , we implanted CGM into the surgical trauma. Rats were thus divided into three groups: ( 1) sham operation group: craniotomy only; ( 2) lesion<symptom> ( L) group: craniotomy + surgical trauma lesion<symptom>; ( 3) lesion<symptom> + CGM ( L + CGM) group: CGM implanted following craniotomy and surgical trauma lesion<symptom>. Cells positive for SOX2 ( marker of proliferating neural progenitor cells) and matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP2 and MMP9) in the lesion<symptom> boundary zone were assayed and analyzed by immunofluorescence and ELISA commercial kits , respectively. Our results demonstrated that following implantation of CGM after surgical brain trauma , significant increases in MMP2
