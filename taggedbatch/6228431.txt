 Response to Intervention ( RTI) was accepted in the early 2000s as a new framework for identifying learning difficulties ( LD) in the U.S.. In Finland , a similar multi-tiered framework has existed since 2010. In the present study , these frameworks are presented from the viewpoint of the role of assessment and instruction as expressed in documents that describe the frameworks , as it seems that these two components of RTI are the most disparate between the U.S. and Finland. We present a suggestion for the Finnish framework as an example of support in mathematics learning that incorporates principles of RTI ( such as systematized assessment and instruction , cyclic support , and modifiable instruction). Finally , recommendations are presented for further refining and developing assessment and instruction policies in the two countries.
