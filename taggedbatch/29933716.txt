 As cardiac troponins emerge as prognostic markers in atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) , it is important to identify mechanisms initiating and perpetuating cardiac troponin release , including its relations to other circulating biomarkers , in AF populations. We studied associations between high-sensitivity troponin I ( hs-TnI) and markers representing myocardial wall tension , inflammation<symptom> and haemostasis in persistent AF. In a double blind , placebo-controlled study , 171 patients referred for electrical cardioversion for persistent AF were randomised to receive candesartan or placebo for 3-6 weeks before and 6 months after cardioversion. Associations between baseline levels of hs-TnI and other biomarkers were investigated by bivariate non-parametric correlations ( Spearman 's correlation coefficient denoted r Baseline levels of hs-TnI correlated significantly , although weakly , with interleukin-6 ( r Hs-TnI correlated weakly with biomarkers representing myocardial wall tension , inflammation<symptom> and haemostasis in persistent AF. The lack of any strong correlation between hs-TnI and the investigated biomarkers is in concert with the idea that hs-TnI release is an independent process parallel to other pathophysiological mechanisms associated with AF.
