 Tumor-associated gangliosides play important roles in regulation of signal transduction induced by growth-factor receptors including EGFR , FGFR , HGF and PDGFR in a specific microdomain called glycosynapse in the cancer cell membranes<symptom> , and in interaction with glycan recognition molecules involved in cell adhesion and immune regulation including selectins and siglecs. As the genes involved in the synthesis and degradation of tumor-associated gangliosides were identified , biological functions became clearer from the experimental results employing forced overexpression and/or knockdown/knockout of the genes. Studies on the regulatory mechanisms for their expression also achieved great advancements. Epigenetic silencing of glycan-related genes is a dominant mechanism in glycan alteration at early stages of carcinogenesis. Development of hypoxia resistance involving activation of a transcription factor HIF , and acquisition of cancer stem cell-like characteristics through epithelial-mesenchymal transition are important mechanisms for glycan modulations in the later stages of cancer progression. In the initial stages of studies , the gangliosides which specifically appear in cancers attracted attention under the name of tumor-associated gangliosides. However , it became apparent that not only the cancer-associated gangliosides but also the normal gangliosides present in nonmalignant cells and tissues perform important biological functions , and some of them tend to disappear in cancer cells resulting in the loss of the physiological functions , and this sometimes facilitates progression of cancers.
