 This study was designed to determine the extent to which alluvial and bedrock gold mining activities in the Kette-Batouri region of Eastern Cameroon are responsible for the discharge of potentially harmful elements ( PHEs) into natural water bodies. This is considered to be of great public concern , since elevated levels of PHEs in these water bodies , which are widely used for domestic purposes , could have adverse health and environmental effects on the population and nearby ecosystems. The investigation into the levels of PHEs in natural water bodies of this area was conducted to ascertain the toxicity posed by mine waste stockpiles as data from the literature on this subject are scarce. Forty-two water samples from the region were analysed for some 60 PHEs by ICP-OES , of which 22 that were not below the detection limit were considered for further data analysis. Maximum total concentrations in water of As , Cr , Pb , and V and Zn are above the World Health Organization ( WHO) maximum allowable concentration ( MAC) levels and are as follows ( Î¼g l
