 Predicting the conserved secondary structure of homologous ribonucleic acid ( RNA) sequences is crucial for understanding RNA functions. However , fast and accurate RNA structure prediction is challenging , especially when the number and the divergence of homologous RNA increases. To address this challenge , we propose aliFreeFold , based on a novel alignment-free approach which computes a representative structure from a set of homologous RNA sequences using sub-optimal secondary structures generated for each sequence. It is based on a vector representation of sub-optimal structures capturing structure conservation signals by weighting structural motifs according to their conservation across the sub-optimal structures. We demonstrate that aliFreeFold provides a good balance<symptom> between speed and accuracy regarding predictions of representative structures for sets of homologous RNA compared to traditional methods based on sequence and structure alignment. We show that aliFreeFold is capable of uncovering conserved structural features fastly and effectively thanks to its weighting scheme that gives more ( resp. less) importance to common ( resp. uncommon) structural motifs. The weighting scheme is also shown to be capable of capturing conservation signal as the number of homologous RNA increases. These results demonstrate the ability of aliFreefold to efficiently and accurately provide interesting structural representatives of RNA families. aliFreeFold was implemented in C++.
