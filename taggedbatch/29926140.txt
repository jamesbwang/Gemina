 Mannosylerythritol lipids ( MELs) are a type of glycolipid biosurfactant produced by basidiomycetous yeasts , most notably those belonging to the genera Pseudozyma and Ustilago. Mannosylerythritol lipids are environmentally friendly and possess many unique functions , such as gene delivery , bio-activation , and human skin repair , and thus have potential applications in cosmetic , pharmaceutical , agriculture , food , and environmental industries. However , MELs will require overcoming same issues related to the commercialization , e.g. , expansion of the structure and function variety and cost reduction. In the past decade , various studies have attempted to tailor production of targeted MELs in order to expand the utility of these biosurfactants. Moreover , the rapid development of genomic sequencing techniques will enhance our ability to modify MEL producers. In this review , we focus on current research into the tailored production of MELs , including conventional and advanced approaches.
