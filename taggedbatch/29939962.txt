 We have previously demonstrated that lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA) plays key roles in the initial mechanisms for neuropathic pain ( NeuP) development. Here , we examined whether LPA receptor mechanisms and LPA production are related to the glial activation at a late stage after partial sciatic nerve ligation ( pSNL) by use of microglial inhibitor , Mac1-saporin or astrocyte inhibitor , and L-Î±-aminoadipate ( L-AA). Although single intrathecal injection of LPA1/3 antagonist , Ki-16425 did not affect the pain threshold at day 7 after the spinal<disease> cord injury , repeated treatments of each compound gradually reversed the basal pain threshold to the control level. The intrathecal administration of a microglia inhibitor , Mac-1-saporin reversed the late hyperalgesia and LPA production at day 14 after the pSNL , whereas L-AA inhibited the hyperalgesia , but had no effect on LPA production. The involvement of LPA receptors in astrocyte activation in vivo was evidenced by the findings that Ki-16425 treatments abolished the upregulation of CXCL1 in activated astrocytes in the spinal dorsal horn of mice at day 14 after the pSNL , and that Ki-16425 reversed the LPA-induced upregulation of several chemokine gene expressions in primary cultured astrocytes. Finally , we found that significant hyperalgesia was observed with intrathecal administration of primary cultured astrocytes , which had been stimulated by LPA in a Ki-16425-reversible manner. All these findings suggest that LPA production and LPA1/3 receptor activation through differential glial mechanisms play key roles in the maintenance as well as initiation mechanisms in NeuP.
