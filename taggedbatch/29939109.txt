 Navigated inspection seeks to improve hazard identification ( HI) accuracy. With tight inspection schedule , HI also requires efficiency. However , lacking quantification of HI efficiency , navigated inspection strategies can not be comprehensively assessed. This work aims to determine inspection efficiency in navigated safety inspection , controlling for the HI accuracy. Based on a cognitive method of the random search model ( RSM) , an experiment was conducted to observe the HI efficiency in navigation , for a variety of visual clutter ( VC) scenarios , while using eye-tracking devices to record the search process and analyze the search performance. The results show that the RSM is an appropriate instrument , and VC serves as a hazard classifier for navigation inspection in improving inspection efficiency. This suggests a new and effective solution for addressing the low accuracy and efficiency of manual inspection through navigated inspection involving VC and the RSM. It also provides insights into the inspectors ' safety inspection ability.
