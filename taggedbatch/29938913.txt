 Skin pigmentation abnormalities are manifested in several disorders associated with deficient DNA repair mechanisms such as nucleotide excision repair ( NER) and double-strand break ( DSB) diseases , a topic that has not received much attention up to now. Hereditary disorders associated with defective DNA repair are valuable models for understanding mechanisms that lead to hypo- and hyperpigmentation. Owing to the UV-associated nature of abnormal pigmentary manifestations , the outcome of the activated DNA damage response ( DDR) network could be the effector signal for alterations in pigmentation , ultimately manifesting as pigmentary abnormalities in repair-deficient disorders. In this review , the role of the DDR network in the manifestation of pigmentary abnormalities in NER and DSB disorders is discussed with a special emphasis on NER disorders.
