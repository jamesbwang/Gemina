 To observe the effects of lyceum barbarum polysaccharide ( LBP) on insulin resistance of HepG2 cells and investigate its possible mechanism. IR-HepG2 cell model was induced with high glucose and high insulin in combination for 24 hours , with 10 Compared with normal control group , the content of MDA was increased significantly and the activity of SOD and the expression levels of IRS-2 , PI-3K , Akt and GLUT2 were decreased significantly in the IR model group. Compared with IR model group , medium and high concentrations of LBP decreased the content of MDA and increased the activity of SOD and the expression levels of IRS-2 , PI-3K , Akt and GLUT2 in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. MTT showed that at the same time , the OD value gradually decreased with the increase of LBP 's concentration; under the same concentration of LBP , the OD value also gradually decreased with the extension of time , which indicated that LBP inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells with time and concentration-dependent manner. Glucose consumption experiment indicated that medium and high concentration of LBP could increase the glucose consumption of insulin-resistant HepG2 cells significantly , but low concentration of LBP had no significant impacted on glucose consumption of insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. Medium and high concentration of LBP can improve insulin resistance of HepG2 cell , its mechanisns may be associated with decreasing the level of oxidative stress and increasing the protein expressions of insulin signaling pathway.
