 Knowledge of a person 's HIV<pathogen> status during pregnancy is critical for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV<pathogen>. To determine the prevalence and factors associated with unknown HIV<pathogen> status among women delivering in Mulago Hospital. This was a cross-sectional study of women that had just delivered. The women 's demographic characteristics , health seeking behaviour , health system-related factors and knowledge on PMTCT were collected. Fisher 's exact test , Wilcoxon rank sum test and logistic regression were used to test associations. The prevalence of unknown HIV<pathogen> status was 2.6 % ( 10/382). Attending ANC at higher level facilities ( OR = 0.1 95 % CI 0.0- 0.4) and having been counselled for HIV<pathogen> testing during ANC ( OR = 0.1 , 95 % CI 0.0- 0.4) were associated with likelihood of having a known HIV<pathogen> status. Out of the ten women with unknown HIV<pathogen> status , 4/6 who attended ANC in public/government accredited health facilities `` opted out '' of HIV<pathogen> testing due to personal reasons. Among the four who attended ANC in private clinics , two were not offered HIV<pathogen> testing and one `` opted out ''. Most participants had a known HIV<pathogen> status at labour ( 97 %). Private clinics need to be supported to provide free quality HCT services in ANC.
