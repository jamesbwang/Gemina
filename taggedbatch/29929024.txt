 In this study , we report a case of solitary Langerhans cell histiocytosis ( LCH) without skull or systemic lesions<symptom> including reviewing the initial magnetic resonance ( MR) findings of cerebral LCH. A 36-year-old male patient presented with generalized tonic-clonic type seizure<symptom>. Brain MR imaging showed a 3-cm mass lesion<symptom> involving the right frontal lobe. It showed isointensity on T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. After gadolinium enhancement , the mass showed heterogeneous enhancement with perilesional edema<symptom> and additional adjacent leptomeningeal enhancement. Special MR techniques focused on the enhanced lesion<symptom> showed increased cerebral blood volume on perfusion images , no diffusion restriction on diffusion-weighted images , and a necrotic spectrum on MR spectroscopy. At surgery , we found a yellow mass and yellow tissue debris in the sulci<pathogen> adjacent to the mass and removed them. The final histopathologic diagnosis was LCH in the frontal lobe. The patient underwent scheduled adjuvant chemotherapy with cytarabine for 6 months and has been regularly followed up without any neurologic problem for 3 years. In conclusion , additional sulcal enhancement around the mass lesion<symptom> might be a clue MR imaging feature of intracerebral LCH , and special MR imaging techniques such as perfusion imaging , diffusion-weighted imaging , and MR spectroscopy could be helpful in differential diagnosis.
