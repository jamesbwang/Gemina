 Many medical schools require scholarly research projects. However , outcomes data from these initiatives are scarce. The authors studied the impact of the Scholarly Research Project ( SRP) , a four-year longitudinal requirement for all students at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine ( UPSOM) , on research productivity and residency match. The authors conducted a longitudinal study of non-dual-degree UPSOM graduates in 2006 ( n = 121 , non-SRP participants) versus 2008 ( n = 118) , 2010 ( n = 106) , and 2012 ( n = 132) , all SRP participants. The authors used PubMed for publication data , National Resident Matching Program for residency match results , and Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research for National Institutes of Health funding rank for residency-affiliated academic institutions. Research productivity of students increased for those completing the SRP , measured as a greater proportion of students with publications ( 27.3 % in 2006 vs. 45.8 % in 2008 , 55.7 % in 2010 , and 54.5 % in 2012; P < .001) and first authorship ( 9.9 % in 2006 vs. 26.3 % in 2008 , 33.0 % in 2010 , and 35.6 % in 2012; P < .001). Across years , there was a significantly greater proportion of students with peer-reviewed publications matched in higher ranked residency programs ( 57.0 % with publications in the top 10 % , 52.7 % in the top 10-25 % , 32.4 % in the top 25-50 % , 41.2 % in the bottom 50 % , and 45.2 % in unranked programs; P = .018). Longitudinal research experiences for medical students may be one effective tool in fostering student publications and interest in extending their training in a research-focused medical center.
