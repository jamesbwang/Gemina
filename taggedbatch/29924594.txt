 In the present work , we investigated the combined effect of poly ( styrene-methyl methacrylate-acrylic acid) ( P ( St-MMA-AA)) PCs with the disperse dye C.I. Disperse Red 343 on the photonic crystals ( PCs) shape , distribution , organization , iridescence , chemical structure , thermal stability , and reflectance. PCs were successfully produced in the form of highly spherical , monodisperse colloidal structures. Presence of dye in the PCs inner core-shell structure was confirmed via Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy. The PCs brightness and iridescent effect was enhanced by the presence of the dyestuff , which also promoted the self-assembly of the colloidal nanospheres in the form of arrays. The P ( St-MMA-AA) PCs thermal stability did not alter with the introduction of the dye. In a side experiment , dyed PCs were also coated onto dyed polyamide fabrics. Data reported successful coating of the textile fabric and an improvement of its reflectance. Fabric immobilization fostered the self-assembling of the dyed colloidal nanospheres in the form of well-organized face-centered cubic , closed-packed arrays. This is the simplest and most energy favorable organization for PCs. The combination of disperse dyes with PCs is a very recent and challenging idea and could open new ways to understand the influence the PCs photonic-band structure may exert on the photoluminescence properties of the dyes embedded in the PCs inner space , and vice versa.
