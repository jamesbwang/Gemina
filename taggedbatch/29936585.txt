 The upsurge in copper oxide nanoparticle ( CuONP) applications in various fields triggers hazardous effects on health. Resveratrol , a polyphenol found in plants of stilbene class , has been reported to decrease oxidative stress. The current study investigated the protective effect of resveratrol ( RVT) against CuONP-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in male Wistar rats. CuONPs were prepared by precipitation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction ( XRD) technique and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM). Average crystallite size , lattice parameters ( a , b , and c) , volume of unit cell , and X-ray density were found to be 33 nm , ( a = 4.691 Å , b = 3.409 Å , and c = 5.034 Å) , 79.4 Å
