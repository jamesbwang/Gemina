 The first realization of the amino-trimethylenemethane chemistry is reported using a deprotonation strategy to simplify the synthesis of the amino-trimethylenemethane donor in two steps from commercial and inexpensive materials. A broad scope of cycloaddition acceptors ( seven different classes) participated in the chemistry , chemo- , regio- , diastereo- , and enantioselectively generating various types of highly valuable complex amino cycles. Multiple derivatization reactions that further elaborated the initial amino cycles were performed without isolation of the crude product. Ultimately , we applied the amino-trimethylenemethane chemistry to synthesize a potential pharmaceutical in 8 linear steps and 7.5 % overall yield , which previously was achieved in 18 linear steps and 0.6 % overall yield.
