 Plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDCs) are an immune subset devoted to the production of high amounts of type 1 interferons in response to viral<disease> infections<disease>. Whereas conventional dendritic cells ( cDCs) originate mostly from a common dendritic cell progenitor ( CDP) , pDCs have been shown to develop from both CDPs and common lymphoid progenitors. Here , we found that pDCs developed predominantly from IL-7R
