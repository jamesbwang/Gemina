 The anti-lung tumor potential of 11-carbonyl-β-boswellic acid was investigated. The inhibitory effects of 11-carbonyl-β-boswellic acid on non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) was assessed by proliferation , apoptosis , cell cycle and molecular mechanisms in NSCLC H446 cells in vitro. The results showed that the growth of H446 cells was significantly inhibited by 11-carbonyl-β-boswellic acid in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Meanwhile , 11-carbonyl-β-boswellic acid induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle G2-M phase arrest in H446 cells. Mechanistically , 11-carbonyl-β-boswellic acid could activate JNK signaling pathway , down-regulate the expression of surviving protein , and activate the cleavage of PARP , leading to marked inhibitory effect on H446 cells. These findings suggest that 11-carbonyl-β-boswellic acid may be a potential usefulness for preventing and treatment of NSCLC.
