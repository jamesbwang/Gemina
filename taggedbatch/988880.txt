 Histoplasmosis is a common fungal infection , normally infecting people exposed to demolition sites or bat/bird droppings in the central and eastern states. When a child presents with a chest mass and eosinophilia in a non-endemic region the likelihood of an infectious process like pulmonary histoplasmosis is unknown. A seven year old immunocompetent child with a mediastinal mass and eosinophilia presented with acute<symptom> cough<symptom> , fever<symptom> , non-bloody emesis , and four pound weight<symptom> loss<symptom>. A neoplastic work up was negative. Further evaluation showed a positive M band ( chronic histoplasmosis infection) and negative H band ( acute<disease> infection<disease>). Tissue obtained by thoracotomy demonstrated necrotizing granulomatous<symptom> inflammation<symptom> with calcification consistent with histoplasmosis. Patient recovered after completion of a twelve week course of itraconazole. A mediastinal mass in a symptomatic child has a 50 % risk of cancer as the primary diagnosis. The Infectious<disease> Disease Society of America guidelines recommend treatment of histoplasmosis granulomatous disease with itraconazole if symptomatic and surgery only for obstruction. Thus our patient did not have a clear indication for surgery. In a child with a mediastinal mass , despite low risk factors should they be evaluated for a fungal infection prior to invasive surgery? This case demonstrates that histoplasmosis can cause a granuloma<disease> in a non-endemic region and that an infectious etiology ought to be considered when working up a symptomatic child with a chest mass as it may prevent unnecessary surgery.
