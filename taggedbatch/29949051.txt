 Collagen Type VI ( COLVI) is an extracellular matrix protein that is upregulated in various solid tumours during tumour progression and has been shown to stimulate proliferation , suppress apoptosis and promote invasion and metastasis. It has also been described as a mediator of chemotherapy resistance and as a therapeutic target in preclinical cancer models. Here , we aimed to analyse the prognostic role of COLVI in salivary gland cancer ( SGC). Stromal COLVI protein expression was assessed in primary SGC specimens of 91 patients using immunohistochemistry ( IHC). The IHC expression patterns obtained were subsequently correlated with various survival and clinicopathological features , including Ki-67 and p53 expression. We found that COLVI was expressed in all SGC specimens. High expression was found to be associated with features of malignancy such as high histologic grades , advanced and invasive T stages and metastatic lymph node involvement ( p < 0.05 for all variables). COLVI expression was also found to correlate with both Ki-67 and p53 expression ( p < 0.01). We found that high COLVI expression predicted a significantly inferior 5-year overall survival ( 38.3 % , 55.1 % and 93.8 %; p = 0.002) and remained a significant predictor of prognosis in a multivariate Cox regression analysis ( hazard ratio , 2.62; 95 % confidence interval , 1.22-5.61; p = 0.013). In all low-risk subgroups COLVI expression identified patients with an adverse outcome. Patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy had a poor survival when expressing high levels of COLVI. Our data indicate that stromal COLVI expression associates with key features of malignancy , represents a novel independent prognostic factor and may affect response to radiotherapy in SGC. Although our results warrant validation in an independent cohort , assessing stromal COLVI expression may be suitable for future diagnostic and therapeutic decision making in patients with SGC.
