 This population-based cohort study investigates the association between osteoarthritis ( OA) and dementia as well as the connection between NSAIDs and dementia. We chose the samples from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database and then divided them into two groups , which were then matched 1: 1 by propensity score. The first group was the OA group that contained patients with newly diagnosed OA and the second group was the non-OA group. We used the Ï‡2 test , Student t test , Kaplan-Meier analysis , and Cox proportional hazard model for different purposes. The prevalence of dementia in the OA group was higher than that in the non-OA group. The adjusted hazard ratio of the former was 1.42 ( 95 % CI , 1.30-1.54). We also found that etoricoxib and diclofenac might reduce the incidence of dementia. Patients with OA might have a higher risk of dementia. Both etoricoxib and diclofenac might lower the risk of dementia in patients with OA.
