 Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> N-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidylinositol de-N-acetylase ( CaGpi12) recognises N-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidylinositol ( GlcNAc-PI) from Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> and is able to complement ScGPI12 function. Both N- and C-terminal ends of CaGpi12 are important for its function. CaGpi12 was biochemically characterised using rough endoplasmic reticulum microsomes prepared from BWP17 strain of C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen>. CaGpi12 is optimally active at 30 Â°C and pH 7.5. It is a metal-dependent enzyme that is stimulated by divalent cations but shows no preference for Zn2 + unlike the mammalian homologue. It irreversibly loses activity upon incubation with a metal chelator. Two conserved motifs , HPDDE and HXXH , are both important for its function in the cell. CaGPI12 is essential for growth and viability of C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen>. Its loss causes reduction of GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase activity , cell wall defects and filamentation defects. The filamentation defects could be specifically correlated to an upregulation of the HOG1 pathway.
