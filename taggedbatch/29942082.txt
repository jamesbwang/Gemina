 Epilepsy is a frequent feature of neurodevelopmental disorders ( NDDs) , but little is known about genetic differences between NDDs with and without epilepsy. We analyzed de novo variants ( DNVs) in 6,753 parent-offspring trios ascertained to have different NDDs. In the subset of 1,942 individuals with NDDs with epilepsy , we identified 33 genes with a significant excess of DNVs , of which SNAP25 and GABRB2 had previously only limited evidence of disease association. Joint analysis of all individuals with NDDs also implicated CACNA1E as a novel disease-associated gene. Comparing NDDs with and without epilepsy , we found missense DNVs , DNVs in specific genes , age of recruitment , and severity of intellectual disability to be associated with epilepsy. We further demonstrate the extent to which our results affect current genetic testing as well as treatment , emphasizing the benefit of accurate genetic diagnosis in NDDs with epilepsy.
