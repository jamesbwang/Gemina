 A 5-year-old boy was accidentally injured by a compressed air blast to his right eye and developed periorbital and subconjunctival emphysema and proptosis subsequently. CT scan showed periorbital subcutaneous<disease> and intraorbital emphysema around the right eye , as well as intracranial and cervical emphysema without frank fractures in orbital bones. He was examined under sedation , and the subconjunctival air was aspirated. He was also prophylactically treated with topical and systemic antibiotics to prevent infection. Emphysema was resorbed entirely within 3 weeks. In conclusion , compressed air injury can occur in a child and manifest with orbital and periorbital emphysema without any detectable fracture and any clear entrance site and may need emergent management to save the vision or upper respiratory airways.
