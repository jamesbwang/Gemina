 Fixation of displaced patella fractures with metal implants may be associated with implant failure , post-operative pain , and high re-operation rate. This study reports preliminary clinical results of using five-pointed star lattice sutures for the management of patella transverse fractures. A five-pointed star lattice suture configuration was produced intraoperatively , and 25 patients with patella transverse fractures were treated with this newly designed sutures fixation. All patients were followed up until union of the fractures or until further surgical intervention. At a mean of 1.6 years ( range 0.8-2.5 years) of follow-up , the notes and plain radiographs of the 25 patients were reviewed. Bostman score was used to evaluate the therapeutic effects. All 25 patients experienced union of the patella fractures , with excellent knee function in 19 patients and good in 6 patients evaluated with Bostman score. The newly designed five-pointed star lattice sutures fixation may be a feasible alternative to metal implants fixation in the management of patella transverse fracture. Level IV case series.
