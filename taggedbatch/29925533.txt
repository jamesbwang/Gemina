 The centromere is a chromosomal locus where a microtubule attachment site , termed kinetochore , is assembled in mitosis. In most eukaryotes , with the exception of holocentric species , each chromosome contains a single distinct centromere. A chromosome with an additional centromere undergoes successive rounds of anaphase bridge formation and breakage , or triggers a cell cycle arrest imposed by DNA damage and replication checkpoints.
