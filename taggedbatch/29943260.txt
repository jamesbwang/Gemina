 Breastfeeding monitoring is understood to be the systematic assessment of current , comprehensive and precise data on breastfeeding rates , breastfeeding behaviour and relevant framework conditions at a national and regional level , with the aim of optimal breastfeeding support. For this purpose , in 2009 , the National Breastfeeding Committee in Germany presented an integrative monitoring concept that included different assessment instruments and assessment fields. The hitherto fragmented implementation is still insufficient; in particular , the implementation of longer-term and sustainable concepts within the structures of the healthcare system is still lacking.To systematically collect breastfeeding data , it is mandatory to integrate the different modules. Longitudinal data on selected core breastfeeding indicators should be collected within the quality assurance structures of perinatal medicine and within the regular school entrance examinations , and be integrated into the health surveillance system. Detailed epidemiological studies on breastfeeding and infant nutrition should be carried out every 5 years , covering influencing factors from pregnancy until the end of the first year of life. The monitoring of high-risk groups should take place with systematic interventions within the institutionalized frameworks of `` Early Preventions '' ( local support systems offering assistance to parents and children) and health authorities with social compensatory activities , with the immediate transfer to of the results into practice.The integrative concept of breastfeeding monitoring in Germany is in accordance with international criteria , tailored to existing structures and experiences , and can be presented internationally. Sufficient centralized resources are needed to coordinate and implement this concept.
