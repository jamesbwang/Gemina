 Flail chest is considered a highly morbid condition with reported mortality ranging from 10 to 20 %. It is often associated with other severe injuries , which may complicate management and interpretation of outcomes. The physiologic impact and prognosis of isolated flail chest injury is poorly defined. This is a National Trauma Databank study. All patients from 1/2007 to 12/2014 admitted with flail chest were extracted. Patients with head or abdominal AIS â‰¥ 3 , dead on arrival , or transferred , were excluded. Primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes were need for mechanical ventilation and pneumonia<disease>. Of the 1,047,519 patients with blunt chest injury , 14,718 ( 1.4 %) patients presented with flail chest , and 8098 ( 0.77 %) met inclusion criteria. The most commonly associated intrathoracic injuries were hemothorax ( 57.9 %) and lung contusions ( 63.0 %) , while sternal fracture ( 8.8 %) and cardiac contusion ( 2.5 %) were less common. In total , 29.8 % of patients required mechanical ventilation , and 11.2 % developed pneumonia<disease>. Overall mortality was 5.6 %. On multivariable analysis , age > 65 and need for mechanical ventilation were independent risk factors for mortality ( OR 6.02 , 3.75 , respectively , p < 0.001). Independent predictors for mechanical ventilation included cardiac or pulmonary contusion and sternal fractures ( OR 3.78 , 2.38 , 2.29 , respectively , p < 0.001). Need for mechanical ventilation was an independent predictor of pneumonia<disease> ( OR 13.18 , p < 0.001). Mortality in isolated flail chest is much lower than previously reported. Fewer than 30 % of patients require mechanical ventilation. Need for mechanical ventilation , however , is independently associated with mortality and pneumonia<disease>. Age > 65 is an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes , and these patients may benefit by more aggressive monitoring and treatment.
