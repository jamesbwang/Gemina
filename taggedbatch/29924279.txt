 A cross-sectional study was conducted aimed at determining the frequency and the risk factors for bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum Beta-Lactamase ( ESBL)- producing Enterobacteriaceae in patients hospitalized in a public hospital in Lima. The study included patients over 14 years of age , with positive blood cultures during their hospitalization in Hospital Nacional Cayetano Heredia in 2016. Patients were classified according to the isolated bacterium<pathogen> ( ESBL-producing or not). Bacteremia was caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriacea in 50.6 % of the cases; 55.8 % and 32.6 % by E.<pathogen> Coli and K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , respectively. No differences were found regarding co-morbidity , or prior antibiotic use ( 62.8 % of bacteremia due to ESBLproducing strains and 57 % in the non-producing strains ( p = 0.595)). Half of the bacteremia cases due to Enterobacteriaceae in hospitalized patients are produced by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and , of these , 40 % are acquired in the community.
