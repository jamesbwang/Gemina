 Because of the distinct electronic properties and strong interaction with light , quasi-one-dimensional nanowires ( NWs) with semiconducting property have been demonstrated with tremendous potential for various technological applications , especially electronics and optoelectronics. However , until now , most of the state-of-the-art NW photodetectors are predominantly based on the n-type NW channel. Here , we successfully synthesized p-type SnSe and SnS NWs via the chemical vapor deposition method and fabricated high-performance single SnSe and SnS NW photodetectors. Importantly , these two NW devices exhibit an impressive photodetection performance with a high photoconductive gain of 1.5 Ã— 10
