 Porcine reproductive and respiratory<pathogen><disease> syndrome<pathogen><disease><symptom> ( PRRS) , caused by the PRRS virus ( PRRSV) , is a widespread disease that affects domestic pigs of all ages. Accurate and rapid detection of PRRSV specific neutralizing antibodies levels in a pig herd is beneficial for the evaluation of the herd 's immunity to combat the specific viral<disease> infection<disease>. However , the current methods for viral detection , including fluorescent focus neutralization ( FFN) and cytopathic effect ( CPE) reduction neutralizing assays , are subjective and time-consuming. Therefore , a Clover-tagged PRRSV virus neutralization assay were developed that instrumentally measures the fluorescence signal of Clover stably expressing by a PRRSV infectious clone for at least 10 passages. Herein , the results showed that the proposed Clover-tagged PRRSV neutralization assay is reliable using instrumental measurements of the fluorescence signal of Clover and allows for rapid detection of neutralizing antibodies against PRRSV. The assay was evaluated by testing swine sera from experimental and field samples , and comparisons were made with the traditional FFN and CPE reduction assays. These results suggest that the Clover-tagged PRRSV infectious clone offers a fast and reliable testing method for neutralizing antibodies and could permit high-throughput screening of new antiviral agents.
