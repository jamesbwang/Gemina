 This study aimed to determine the effect of a simulation course on gaze fixation strategies of participants performing arthroscopy. Participants ( n = 16) were recruited from two one-day simulation-based knee arthroscopy courses , and were asked to undergo a task before and after the course , which involved identifying a series of arthroscopic landmarks. The gaze fixation of the participants was recorded with a wearable eye-tracking system. The time taken to complete the task and proportion of time participants spent with their gaze fixated on the arthroscopic stack , the knee model , and away from the stack or knee model were recorded. Participants demonstrated a statistically decreased completion time in their second attempt compared to the first attempt ( P = 0.001). In their second attempt , they also demonstrated improved gaze fixation strategies , with a significantly increased amount ( P = 0.008) and proportion of time ( P = 0.003) spent fixated on the screen vs. knee model. Simulation improved arthroscopic skills in orthopaedic surgeons , specifically by improving their gaze control strategies and decreasing the amount of time taken to identify and mark landmarks in an arthroscopic task.
