 Anaerobic digestion of the heavy metal-contaminated rice straw inoculated with waste activated sludge was carried out through an orthogonal array. The results indicated that the digestion process was optimized with an inoculum to substrate ratio ( I/S) of 0.25 , a total solid ( TS) content of 5 % , and an initial pH of 7.0 , with corresponding total biogas and methane yields of 745.4 and 285.2 mL/g VS , respectively. Under the optimized conditions , the bioleaching percentages of Cd and As in the biomass were 13.13 % and 42.90 % , respectively. According to range analysis , the biogas yield , methane yield , and bioleaching percentages of Cd and As in the biomass significantly decreased with an increase in TS content from 5 % to 15 %. The results suggested that anaerobic digestion with waste activated sludge was feasible for achieving both biogas production and bioleaching of heavy metals from contaminated rice straw.
