 Exposure to high dose ionizing radiation leads to premature cell senescence and suppression of cell proliferation. In contrast , low dose and low dose-rate gamma-irradiation can lead to stimulation of cell proliferation. We aimed to examine whether the low dose radiation-induced proliferation of normal human fibroblasts can lead to a progressive depletion of proliferation potential and to an early onset of senescence. Normal human embryonic lung fibroblasts ( HELF-104) at passage 22-24 were gamma-irradiated with doses of 0 ( sham-irradiation) , 10 , 30 , 50 , 90 , 120 , 150 , 200 , 500 mGy as well as 1 and 2 Gy. After irradiation , the fraction of cells positively stained for senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase activity was measured weekly until the cell culture completely ceased to proliferate. We show that single irradiation of HELF-104 cells with 30 and 50 mGy resulted in deceleration of senescence. The suppression of senescence was observed during almost the entire length of the study up to a complete arrest of cell growth. Our data , together with the previously published observation of delayed stimulation of proliferation in HELF-104 cells exposed to 30 mGy , suggest that low dose gamma-irradiation can increase the overall proliferative potential of normal human fibroblasts.
