 Psoriasis is associated with a high economic burden to society. New psoriasis systemic treatments offer the potential for improved skin clearance. Whether a higher degree of clearing translates into economic benefit through decreased work impairment has not been fully determined. To assess whether more complete clearing of psoriasis is associated with a reduction in disease-related indirect costs. Pooled data from employed patients included in the CLEAR study , a phase 3b study comparing the efficacy and safety of secukinumab ( 337 subjects) versus ustekinumab ( 339 subjects) , were classified into 4 levels of skin clearance improvement at weeks 16 and 52: Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ( PASI) improvement from baseline of < 50 % ( PASI < 50) , 50 % -74 % ( PASI 50-74) , 75 % -89 % ( PASI 75-89) , and ≥ 90 % ( PASI ≥ 90). Patients completed the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire for psoriasis ( WPAI-PSO) , which assessed absenteeism , presenteeism , and a composite overall work impairment over the previous 7 days at weeks 16 and 52. U.S. Department of Labor data were used to calculate annual indirect costs due to work productivity loss. In the CLEAR study , 452 ( 67 %) were employed at baseline and included in this analysis. At week 16 , mean overall work impairment significantly decreased with higher PASI improvements: 22.8 % for PASI < 50 , compared with 13.3 % for PASI 50-74 ( P = 0.001); 6.4 % for PASI 75-89 ( P < 0.001); and 4.9 % for PASI ≥ 90 ( P < 0.001) , with the majority of work impairment related to presenteeism. Calculated mean work hours lost by overall work impairment decreased with higher PASI improvements: 8.2 hours lost/week ( 429 hours/year) for patients with PASI 50; 4.6 hours lost/week ( 251 hours/year) for PASI 50-74; 2.3 hours lost/week ( 121 hours/year) for PASI 75-89; and 1.8 hours lost/week ( 93 hours/year) for PASI ≥ 90. Associated mean annual indirect costs due to work productivity loss per worker decreased with higher PASI improvements: $ 10,318 for PASI < 50 , $ 6,042 for PASI 50-74 , $ 2,901 for PASI 75-89 , and $ 2,233 for PASI ≥ 90. Similar results were observed at week 52. Mean overall work impairment decreased with higher PASI improvements , ranging from 26.3 % for PASI < 50 to 6.9 % for PASI ≥ 90. A decrease in overall work hours lost ( ranging from 9.5 hours lost/week ( 495 hours/year) for PASI < 50 to 2.5 hours/week ( 130 hours/year) for PASI ≥ 90) , as well as associated annual indirect costs due to work productivity loss ( ranging from $ 11,906 for PASI < 50 to $ 3,125 for PASI ≥ 90) , were also shown with higher PASI improvements at week 52. Among working patients with moderate<symptom> to severe psoriasis , higher PASI improvements were associated with lower work productivity loss and reduced annual indirect costs. By improving and sustaining skin clearance , psoriasis treatments may contribute to increased work productivity and decreased societal economic burden.
