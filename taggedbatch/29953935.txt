 Chronic heavy methamphetamine use likely causes dopaminergic neurotoxicity , which is commonly thought to result in cognitive control deficits. Both of these alterations may persist even after the use is discontinued , but tend to ( partly) improve with increasing duration of abstinence. While several studies have demonstrated that the reinstatement of comparatively normal dopaminergic signaling may take months , if not years , the amelioration of cognitive deficits has predominantly been investigated in much shorter intervals of several weeks to less than half a year. Against this background , we set out to investigate the effects on prolonged abstinence in n = 27 abstinent former methamphetamine users in a cross-sectional design using behavioral and neurophysiological measures of cognitive control. Our behavioral results suggest that former users struggled to identify and adapt to different degrees of cognitive control requirements , which made their behavioral performance less expedient than that of healthy controls. On the neurophysiological level , this was reflected by reduced modulations of the N2-N450 amplitude in response to high vs. low cognitive control requirements. Yet , those effects could only be observed in methamphetamine users who had been abstinent for a relatively short time ( mean 9.9; max. 18 months) , but not in former users who had been abstinent two years or longer. While this finding alone does not allow for causal inferences , it suggests that the amelioration of control deficits may take longer than what is commonly investigated ( 1-6 months). Hence , some of the statements about permanent/irreversible dopamine-dependent executive dysfunctions in former methamphetamine users should be interpreted with caution.
