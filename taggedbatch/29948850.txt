 Hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) is a global health concern , notably in Southeast Asia , and in Laos the presentation of the HCV-induced liver disease is poorly known. Our objective was thus to describe a comprehensive HCV<pathogen> infection pattern in order to guide national health policies. A study on a group of 1765 patients formerly diagnosed by rapid test in health centres was conducted at the Centre of Infectiology Lao Christophe Merieux in Vientiane. The demographic information of patients , their infection status ( viral load: VL) , liver function ( aminotransferases) and treatments were analysed. Results showed that gender distribution of infected people was balanced; with median ages of 53.8 for men and 51.6 years for women ( 13-86 years). The majority of patients ( 72 %) were confirmed positive ( VL > 50 IU/mL) and 28 % of them had high VL ( > 6log
