 This paper presents the overall design of a prototype home-based system aimed to reduce sedentary behavior of older adults. Quantitative performance indicators were developed to measure the sedentary behavior and daily activities of an older adult<disease>. The sedentary behavior is monitored by identifying individual positions ( standing , sitting , and lying) within the field of view of a Microsoft Kinect sensor , using a custom designed algorithm. The physical activity of the older adult<disease> when outside the field of view of the Microsoft Kinect sensor , is monitored by counting the number of steps using a Fitbit Charge HR watch , which the older adult<disease> is equipped with. A user interface was developed on a PC platform to interact with the older adult<disease>. The user interface is automatically operated and includes several modules. It displays the activity level , and provides feedbacks , alerts , and reminders to reduce sedentary behavior. Evaluations using a mixed methods approach that included a focus group , interviews , and observations were conducted to examine the integrated system , evaluate the users ' experience with the system , and compare different types of feedbacks and alerts. The analyses indicated the feasibility of the proposed SIT LESS system along with recommendations for improving the system in future research.
