 Sleep is considered as a physiological regulator in the body. Gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA) is a neurotransmitter that modulates sleep and affects cardiac functions. We evaluated effects of acute sleep deprivation ( SD) on cardiac hemodynamic parameters , expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines , and Heat shock<symptom> protein ( Hsp70) , serum level of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) and prooxidant/antioxidant balance<symptom> ( PAB). Male Wistar rats were bilaterally cannulated in the central nucleus of amygdala ( CeA) and saline or bicuculline was injected 24 hours prior to induction of 30 minute ischemia following 120 minute reperfusion. Forty-eight animals were randomly divided into four groups: Control ( CONT) , bicuculline ( BIC) , acute SD and bicuculline + acute sleep deprivation ( BIC+SD). Animals in SD and BIC+SD groups were put in an aquarium for inducing sleep deprivation. SD attenuated LDH , pro-inflammatory cytokines and PAB; improved cardiac hemodynamic parameters and increased Hsp70 in non-infarcted area as compared to CONT. Administration of bicuculline increased LDH , pro-inflammatory cytokines and PAB , reduced cardiac hemodynamic parameters and Hsp70 as compared to CONT. Furthermore , bicuculline administration prior to acute sleep induction decreased SD effects on LDH , PAB , Hsp70 , cardiac hemodynamic parameters and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Induction of SD prior to ischemia/reperfusion induces cardioprotection through suppressing inflammatory responses.
