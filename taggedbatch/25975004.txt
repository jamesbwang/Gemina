 Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD) has been associated with telomere dysfunction and alterations in mitochondrial activity , which seem to be co-regulated in human cells. To investigate this co-regulation in MDD , we assessed telomere length ( TL) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC) and selected immune cell subsets by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization and mitochondrial respiratory activity in PBMC by high-resolution respirometry in a study cohort of 18 MDD patients and 21 non-depressed controls. We provide initial evidence for a differential vulnerability to telomere attrition in selected adaptive immune cell populations. Here we found the highest difference in TL between depressed and control subjects for memory cytotoxic T cells. Depression<symptom> was associated with reduced mitochondrial activity ( mitochondrial bioenergetics) , but increased mitochondrial density ( mitochondrial biogenesis) in PBMC. Exploratory post-hoc analyses indicated that the changes in TL and immune cell bioenergetics were most pronounced in MDD patients who reported experiences of childhood sexual abuse. Among MDD patients , PBMC TL was as a trend positively associated with mitochondrial density and negatively associated with mitochondrial leak respiration<symptom> , but not with mitochondrial activity related to biological energy production. These initial findings support the hypothesis of a co-regulation between telomeres and mitochondrial biogenesis but not mitochondrial bioenergetics among MDD patients.
