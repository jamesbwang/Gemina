 Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by episodic headaches<symptom> with specific features , presenting familial aggregation. Migraine is associated with episodic vertigo<symptom> , named Vestibular Migraine ( VM) whose diagnosis mainly rely on clinical history showing a temporary association of symptoms. Some patient refers symptoms occurring in pediatric age , defined `` episodic symptoms which may be associated with migraine. '' The aim of this cross sectional observational study was to assess migraine-related clinical features in VM subjects. For the purpose , 279 patients were recruited in different centers in Europe; data were collected by a senior neurologist or ENT specialist through a structured questionnaire. The age of onset of migraine was 21.8 Â± 9. The duration of headaches<symptom> was lower than 24 h in 79.1 % of cases. Symptoms accompanying migrainous headaches<symptom> were , in order of frequency , nausea<symptom> ( 79.9 %) , phonophobia ( 54.5 %) , photophobia<symptom> ( 53.8 %) , vomiting<symptom> ( 29 %) , lightheadedness ( 21.1 %). Visual or other auras were reported by 25.4 % of subjects. A familial aggregation was referred by 67.4 % , while migraine precursors were reported by 52.3 % of subjects. Patients reporting nausea<symptom> and vomiting during headaches<symptom> more frequently experienced the same symptoms during vertigo<symptom>. Comparing our results in VM subjects with previously published papers in migraine sufferers , our patients presented a lower duration of headaches<symptom> and a higher rate of familial aggregation; moreover some common characters were observed in headache<symptom> and vertigo<symptom> attacks for accompanying symptoms like nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom> and clustering of attacks.
