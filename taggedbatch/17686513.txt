 The modulus of carbon fiber-reinforced polyether ether ketone ( CFR-PEEK) , a composite containing layers of carbon fiber sheets , can be precisely controlled to match bone. However , CFR-PEEK is biologically inert and can not promote bone apposition. The objective of this study was to investigate whether graphene modification could enhance the bioactivity of CFR-PEEK. In vitro , the proliferation and differentiation of rat bone<disease> marrow stromal cells on scaffolds were quantified via cell-counting kit-8 assay and Western blotting analysis of osteoblast-specific proteins. Graphene modification significantly promoted bone<disease> marrow stromal cell proliferation and accelerated induced differentiation into osteogenic lineages compared to cells seeded onto nongraphene-coated CFR-PEEK. An in vivo rabbit extraarticular graft-to-bone healing model was established. At 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks after surgery , microcomputed tomography analyses and histological observations revealed significantly better microstructural parameters and higher average mineral apposition rates for graphene-modified CFR-PEEK implants than CFR-PEEK implants ( Graphene may have considerable potential to enhance the bioactivity and osseointegration of CFR-PEEK implants for clinical applications.
