 Genome-wide association studies ( GWAS) have been steadily used for identification of genomic links to disease and various economical traits. Of those traits , a tenderness<symptom> of pork is one of the most important factors in quality evaluation of consumers. In this study , we use two pig breed populations; Berkshire is known for its excellent meat quality and Duroc which is known for its high intramuscular fat content in meat. Multivariate genome-wide association studies ( MV-GWAS) was executed to compare SNPs of two pigs to find out what genetic variants occur the tenderness<symptom> of pork. Through MV-GWAS , we have identified candidate genes and the association of biological pathways involved in the tenderness<symptom> of pork. From these direct and indirect associations , we displayed the usefulness of simple statistical models and their potential contribution to improving the meat quality of pork. We identified a candidate gene related to the tenderness<symptom> in only Berkshire. Furthermore , several of the biological pathways involved in tenderness<symptom> in both Berkshire and Duroc were found. The candidate genes identified in this study will be helpful to use them in breeding programs for improving pork quality.
