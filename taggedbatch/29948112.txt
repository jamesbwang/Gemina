 A potent phytoestrogen , ( S)- equol , is a promising isoflavone derivative drawing our great attention owing to its various biological and clinical benefits. Through selective activation of the estrogen receptor ERÎ² or androgen receptor , ( S)- equol reduces menopausal symptoms , osteoporosis , skin aging , hair loss , and incidence of prostate or ovarian cancers without adverse effects. Traditional biosynthesis of ( S)- equol exploited non-productive natural equol-producing anaerobic bacteria that mainly belong to Coriobacteriaceae isolated from human intestine. Recently , we developed a recombinant Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strain which could convert daidzein into ( S)- equol effectively under an aerobic condition. However , the yield was limited up to about the 200 mg/L level due to unknown reasons. In this study , we identified that the bottleneck of the limited production was the low solubility of isoflavone ( i.e. , 2.4 mg/L) in the reaction medium. In order to solve the solubility problem without harmful effect to the whole-cell catalyst , we applied commercial hydrophilic polymers ( HPs) and a polar aprotic co-solvent in the reaction medium. Among the examined water-soluble polymers , polyvinylpyrrolidone ( PVP) -40 k was verified as the most promising supplement which increased daidzein solubility by 40 times and ( S)- equol yield up to 1.22 g/L , the highest ever reported and the first g/L level biotransformation. Furthermore , PVP-40k was verified to significantly increase the solubilities of other water-insoluble natural polyphenols in aqueous solution. We suggest that addition of both HP and polar aprotic solvent in the reaction mixture is a powerful alternative to enhance production of polyphenolic chemicals rather than screening appropriate organic solvents for whole-cell catalysis of polyphenols.
