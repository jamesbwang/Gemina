 There is no evidence that Hippocrates , although being credited for it , ever literally stated ` let thy food be thy medicine and thy medicine be thy food '. However , yet in line with Hippocrates ' philosophy , we are currently witnessing a reappraisal of the complementarity of nutrition and pharmacology. Recent studies not only underline the therapeutic potential of lifestyle interventions , but are also generating valuable insights in the complex and dynamic transition from health to disease. Next to this , nutritional biology can significantly contribute to the discovery of new molecular targets. It is clear that most of the current top-selling drugs used in chronic cardio-metabolic diseases modulate relatively late-stage complications , which generally indicate already longer existing homeostatic imbalances. Pharmacologists are increasingly aware that typical multifactorial disorders require subtle , multiple target pharmacological approaches , instead of the still often dominating ` one disease- one target- one drug ' paradigm. This review discusses the recent developments in the pharma-nutrition interface and shows some relevant mechanisms , including receptors and other targets , and examples from clinical practice. The latter includes inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> and progressive<symptom> loss<symptom> of muscle function. The examples also illustrate the potential of targeted combinations of medicines with nutrition and ( or) other life-style interventions , to increase treatment efficacy and ( or) reduce adverse effects. More attention to a potentially negative outcome of drug-food combinations is also required , as shown by the example of food-drug interactions. Together , the developments at the food-pharma interface underline the demand for intensified collaboration between the disciplines , in the clinic and in science.
