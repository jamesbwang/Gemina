 It is a general and common practice to carry out single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments at cryogenic temperatures in order to obtain high-resolution data. In this report , we show that this practice is not always applicable to metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs) , especially when these structures are highly porous. Specifically , two new MOFs are reported here , MOF-1004 and MOF-1005 , for which the collection of the diffraction data at lower temperature ( 100 K) did not give data of sufficient quality to allow structure solution. However , collection of data at higher temperature ( 290 K) gave atomic-resolution data for MOF-1004 and MOF-1005 , allowing for structure solution. We find that this inverse behavior , contrary to normal practice , is also true for some well-established MOFs ( MOF-177 and UiO-67). Close examination of the X-ray diffraction data obtained for all four of these MOFs at various temperatures led us to conclude that disordered guest-framework interactions play a profound role in introducing disorder at low temperature , and the diminishing strength of these interactions at high temperatures reduces the disorder and gives high-resolution diffraction data. We believe our finding here is more widely applicable to other highly porous MOFs and crystals containing highly disordered molecules.
