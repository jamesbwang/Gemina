 Self-assembly of a covalently-bound lipophilic drug to a dendronic scaffold for making organic nanoparticles is reported as a proof of concept in nanovectorization. A minimalist structural approach with a small PEG-dendron conjugated to paclitaxel ( PTX) , incorporating safe succinic and gallic acids , is efficient to provide the expected anticancer bioactivity , but also significantly retards and targets intracellular delivery of PTX in 2D and 3D lung cancer cell cultures. A branching effect of dendrons is crucial , when compared to linear PTX conjugates. Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) and dynamic light-scattering ( DLS) studies indicate the formation of stable , low-disperse nanoparticles at 10
