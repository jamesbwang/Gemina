 We report the development of nanowire field-effect transistors featuring an ultrathin parylene film as a polymer gate insulator. The room temperature , gas-phase deposition of parylene is an attractive alternative to oxide insulators prepared at high temperatures using atomic layer deposition. We discuss our custom-built parylene deposition system , which is designed for reliable and controlled deposition of < 100 nm thick parylene films on III-V nanowires standing vertically on a growth substrate or horizontally on a device substrate. The former case gives conformally coated nanowires , which we used to produce functional Î©-gate and gate-all-around structures. These give subthreshold swings as low as 140 mV/dec and on/off ratios exceeding 10
