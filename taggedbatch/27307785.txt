 Acute calculous cholecystitis<disease> is a prevalent disease whose diagnosis and management still face significant debate. Although the overall incidence of gallstone disease is 18.8 % in European women aged 30 to 69 years , there is little data and experience in managing acute calculous cholecystitis<disease> in populations over 80 years old. The incidence of acute cholecystitis<disease> among the elderly is probably increasing. For the reason , we here highlight the advantages and disadvantage of various treatment and management opens based on a 96-year-old patient. We present a rare case in which a 96-year-old woman suffered from abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , nausea<symptom> , and lack of appetite<symptom> for over a month. She was diagnosed with acute calculous cholecystitis<disease> and pancreatitis<disease>. She was successfully treated without surgery , regaining her physical health after 5 months. The question of how to manage acute calculous cholecystitis<disease> is extremely difficult in many aspects. The patient of very advanced age presented in this paper , not very well diagnosed and with a life-threating condition , survived because of careful treatment and reasonable decision-making. The take-away from this case is that , in a high-risk senile patient , strict conservative therapy of cholecystitis<disease> may be successful , as it can avoid the complications of surgery and leave the patient with a good quality of life.
