 Prostate adenocarcinoma ( PCa) is a complex genetic disease , and the implementation of personalized treatment in PCa faces challenges due to significant inter- and intrapatient tumor heterogeneities. To systematically explore the genomic complexity of tumor cells with different Gleason scores ( GSs) in PCa. We performed single-cell whole genome sequencing of 17 tumor cells from localized lesions<symptom> with distinct GS and matched four normal samples from two prostatectomy patients. All classes of genomic alterations were identified , including substitutions , insertions/deletions , copy number alterations , and rearrangements. Significant spatial , intra- and intertumoral heterogeneities were observed at the cellular level. In the patient 1 , all cells shared the same TP53 driver mutation , implying a monoclonal origin of PCa. In the patient 2 , only a subpopulation of cells contained the TP53 driver mutation , whereas other cells carried different driver mutations , indicating a typical polyclonal model with separate clonal cell expansions. The tumor cells from different sides of prostate owned various mutation patterns. Considerable neoantigens were predicted among different cells , implying unknown immune editing components helping prostate tumor cells escaping from immune surveillance. There is a significant spatial genomic heterogeneity even in the same PCa patient. Our study also provides the first genome-wide evidence at single-cell level , supporting that the origin of PCa could be either polyclonal or monoclonal , which has implications for treatment decisions for prostate cancer. We reported the first single-cell whole genomic data of prostate adenocarcinoma ( PCa) from different Gleason scores. Identification of these genetic alterations may help understand PCa tumor progression and clonal evolution.
