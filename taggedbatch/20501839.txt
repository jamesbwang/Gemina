 Myocardial dysfunction is a major cause of death in sepsis<disease>. MicroRNA-146b ( miR-146b) has been reported to be related to myocardial disease. However , the role of miR-146b in sepsis<disease> as well as myocardial injury is still unclear. Septic cardiac dysfunction in mice was induced by cecal ligation and puncture ( CLP) and miR-146b was found increased significantly in the myocardium tissue of CLP mice. It was found that up-regulation of miR-146b by agomiR injection suppressed expression of IL-1β in mice as well as myocardium apoptosis in CLP mice. However , suppression of miR-146b by antagomiR injection had inverse effects. Notch1 was identified as a target gene of miR-146b by bioinformatics analysis. And it was verified that in cardiomyocytes , the decrease of miR146b led to increase of both the mRNA and protein level of Notch1 and vice versa. In septic mice serum stimulated cardiomyocytes , up-regulation of miR-146b decreased the level of Notch1 and Hes1. The knockout of Notch1 in transgenic mice showed that the deficiency of Notch1 improved myocardial injury induced by CLP operation. The apoptosis of cardiomyocytes was relieved and the expression of IL-1β was decreased. In conclusion , miR-146b targets to Notch1 and protected cardiomyocytes against inflammation<symptom> and apoptosis.
