 The results of a computer simulation examining the compliance of a given transcranial magnetic stimulation device to the 2010 International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection ( ICNIRP) guidelines are presented. The objective was to update the safe distance estimates with the most current safety guidelines , as well as comparing these to values reported in previous publications. The 3D data generated was compared against results available in the literature , regarding the MCB-70 coil by Medtronic. Regarding occupational exposure , safe distances of 1.46 m and 0.96 m are derived from the simulation according to the 2003 and 2010 ICNIRP guidelines , respectively. These values are then compared to safe distances previously reported in other studies.
