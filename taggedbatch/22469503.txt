 To evaluate case series studies that quantitatively assess the effects of catheter-directed thrombolysis ( CDT) and compare the efficacy of CDT and anticoagulation in patients with acute<symptom> lower extremity deep vein thrombosis ( DVT). Relevant databases , including PubMed , Embase , Cochrane , Ovid MEDLINE and Scopus , were searched through January 2017. The inclusion criteria were applied to select patients with acute<symptom> lower extremity DVT treated with CDT or with anticoagulation. In the case series studies , the pooled estimates of efficacy outcomes for patency rate , complete lysis , rethrombosis and post-thrombotic syndrome<disease><symptom> ( PTS) were calculated across the studies. In studies comparing CDT with anticoagulation , summary odds ratios ( ORs) were calculated. Twenty-five articles ( six comparing CDT with anticoagulation and 19 case series) including 2254 patients met the eligibility criteria. In the case series studies , the pooled results were a patency rate of 0.87 ( 95 % CI: 0.85-0.89) , complete lysis 0.58 ( 95 % CI: 0.40-0.75) , rethrombosis 0.11 ( 95 % CI: 0.06-0.17) and PTS 0.10 ( 95 % CI: 0.08-0.12). Six studies comparing the efficacy outcomes of CDT and anticoagulation showed that CDT was associated with a reduction of PTS ( OR 0.38 , 95 % CI 0.26-0.55 , p < 0.0001) and a higher patency rate ( OR 4.76 , 95 % CI 2.14-10.56 , p < 0.0001). Acute<symptom> lower extremity DVT patients receiving CDT were found to have a lower incidence of PTS and a higher incidence of patency rate. In our meta-analysis , CDT is shown to be an effective treatment for acute<symptom> lower extremity DVT patients.
