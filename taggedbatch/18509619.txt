 Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy ( RALP) requires pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position to optimize surgical exposure , which can increase intracranial pressure ( ICP). Anesthetic agents also influence ICP. We compared the effects of propofol and sevoflurane on sonographic optic nerve sheath diameter ( ONSD) as a surrogate for ICP in prostate cancer patients who underwent RALP. Thirty-six patients were randomly allocated to groups receiving propofol ( propofol group , n = 18) or sevoflurane ( sevoflurane group , n = 18) anesthesia. The ONSD was measured 10 min after induction of anesthesia in the supine position ( T1); 5 min ( T2) , 30 min ( T3) , and 60 min ( T4) after establishing pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position; and at the end of surgery after desufflation in the supine position ( T5). Respiratory and hemodynamic variables were also evaluated. The ONSD was significantly different between the propofol group and the sevoflurane group at T4 ( 5.27 ± 0.35 mm vs. 5.57 ± 0.28 mm , P = 0.007) , but not at other time points. The ONSDs at T2 , T3 , T4 , and T5 were significantly greater than at T1 in both groups ( all P < 0.001). Arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure , arterial oxygen partial pressure , peak airway pressure , plateau airway pressure , systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , pulse pressure variation , body temperature and regional cerebral oxygen saturation , except heart rate , were not significantly different between the two groups. The ONSD was significantly lower during propofol anesthesia than during sevoflurane anesthesia 60 min after pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position , suggesting that propofol anesthesia may help minimize ICP changes in robotic prostatectomy patients.
