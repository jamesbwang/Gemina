 The autonomous pathway promotes flowering by repressing a major flowering repressor , FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC). Approximately 30 genes are involved in this pathway , and several of them are related to RNA processing; however , the molecular basis of the transcriptional regulation of FLC is yet to be understood. Recently , we discovered a new autonomous pathway gene , TATA-binding protein-associated factor 15b ( TAF15b) , which has a RNA recognition motif ( RRM) and represses the level of FLC transcripts. TAF15b regulates the expression of FLC by directly interacting with RNA polymerase II ( Pol II) at the transcription start sites on both the sense and antisense strands of the FLC locus. In addition to the transcriptional regulation in the nucleus , TAF15b accumulates in processing bodies ( p-bodies) , which are cytoplasmic RNA granules involved in translational repression , during heat stress. Here we discuss the implications of our findings and suggest a dual role of TAF15b in both transcriptional and translational regulation.
