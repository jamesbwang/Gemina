 Expression of histone H3 .3 K27M mutant proteins in human diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG) results in a global reduction of tri-methylation of H3K27 ( H3K27me3) , and paradoxically , H3K27me3 peaks remain at hundreds of genomic loci , a dichotomous change that lacks mechanistic insights. Here , we show that the PRC2 complex is sequestered at poised enhancers , but not at active promoters with high levels of H3 .3 K27M proteins , thereby contributing to the global reduction of H3K27me3. Moreover , the levels of H3 .3 K27M proteins are low at the retained H3K27me3 peaks and consequently having minimal effects on the PRC2 activity at these loci. H3K27me3-mediated silencing at specific tumor suppressor genes , including Wilms Tumor 1 , promotes proliferation of DIPG cells. These results support a model in which the PRC2 complex is redistributed to poised enhancers in H3 .3 K27M mutant cells and contributes to tumorigenesis in part by locally enhancing H3K27me3 , and hence silencing of tumor suppressor genes.
