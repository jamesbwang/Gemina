 To report our experience with the recently introduced 34 mm Evolut transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR) prosthesis. A larger TAVR prosthesis has become available for the treatment of aortic stenosis ( AVS) in larger native aortic annuli ( up to 30 mm). Outcomes with this new device are still unreported. The first 25 transfemoral TAVRs performed by our team with the self-expandable 34 mm Evolut are presented. The majority of patients were male ( 84 %) with a mean age of 81.3 ± 5.6 years , a median logistic euro-SCORE of 14.7 ( 5.4-61.0) , and a computed tomography measured mean perimeter-derived aortic annulus diameter of 27.1 ± 1.4 mm ( min. 25.0-max. 31.2 mm). We implanted one 34 mm Evolut in all patients. Median operative time and radiation time were 68.5 and 12.4 min respectively. To optimise final valve position and haemodynamic performance , at least one complete re-sheathing and re-positioning of the same valve was reported in 33.2 %. New permanent pacemaker implantation ( PPMI) was necessary in 28.5 %. At Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC) analysis , a minimal diameter of the left ventricular outflow tract < 21.9 mm was a significant predictor for PPMI ( specificity 82 %; sensitivity 83 %; p = 0.005; Area Under the Curve ( AUC) = 0.9). Length of stay in hospital was 9.2 ± 5.8 days and no in-hospital death was reported. At discharge , grade 1 + para-valvular regurgitation was present in 32 % , and no regurgitation in the remaining patients. Device success and early safety were 100 % and 92 % respectively. TAVR with the 34 mm Evolut prosthesis has shown satisfactory acute outcomes. Although results are consistent with those observed with smaller Evolut prostheses , a trend for a higher PPMI rate has been noticed and could derive from a higher oversizing rate.
