 The purpose of this concept analysis was to examine how the concept of personhood has been used in the nursing literature. The person is central to nursing , as the object of nursing work , or care , and a key element of theory. Health and illness confront conventional notions of personhood based on the Western philosophy , in delineating boundaries of life and death , and grappling with pathophysiological changes and alterations in capacities that challenge our understandings of what makes a person whole. Rodgers ' evolutionary method was selected; it emphasizes the relationship between concepts , language , and communities of users. A literature search between 1950 and 2017 generated 760 articles; 54 were retained for analysis. Four themes were identified: ( 1) personhood and nursing ethics , emphasizing scientific advances , and establishing criteria; ( 2) personhood as a morally significant , relational process realized through nursing care; ( 3) personhood lost ( or neglected); ( 4) interventions aimed at understanding , recognizing , and enhancing personhood. Related terms , antecedent concepts , and consequences are explored. This preliminary view of personhood in the nursing literature demonstrated how the concept has been developed , used , and understood. Areas for future research include nursing ethics , theory , and clinical practice , as well as links with other academic disciplines.
