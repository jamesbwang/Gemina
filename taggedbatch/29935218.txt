 The effect of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> on nasal epithelial repair has never been assessed in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps ( CRSwNP). This study aimed to determine whether ( 1) nasal epithelial cell cultures from patients with CRSwNP and control subjects repair differently; ( 2) S aureus<pathogen> exoproducts compromise nasal epithelial repair; ( 3) S aureus<pathogen> alters lamellipodial dynamics; and ( 4) deleterious effects could be counteracted by the Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase inhibitor Y-27632. Primary nasal epithelial cells ( pNECs) collected during surgeries were cultured and injured under 3 conditions: ( 1) basal conditions , ( 2) exposed to S aureus<pathogen> exoproducts , and ( 3) exposed to S aureus<pathogen> exoproducts and Y-27632. Epithelial repair , lamellipodial dynamics , and cytoskeletal organization were assessed. Under basal conditions , pNEC cultures from patients with CRSwNP presented significantly lower repair rates and reduced lamellipodial protrusion length and velocity than those from control subjects. S aureus<pathogen> exoproducts significantly decreased repair rates and protrusion dynamics in both control subjects and patients with CRSwNP; however , the effect of S aureus<pathogen> on cell protrusions was more sustained over time in patients with CRSwNP. Under basal conditions , immunofluorescence assays showed significantly reduced percentages of cells with lamellipodia at the wound<disease><symptom> edge in patients with CRSwNP compared with control subjects. S aureus<pathogen> altered cell polarity and decreased the percentage of cells with lamellipodia in both groups. Finally , Y-27632 prevented the deleterious effects of S aureus<pathogen> exoproducts on CRSwNP repair rates , as well as on lamellipodial dynamics and formation. S aureus<pathogen> exoproducts significantly alter epithelial repair and lamellipodial dynamics on pNECs , and this impairment was more pronounced in patients with CRSwNP. Importantly , Y-27632 restored epithelial repair and lamellipodial dynamics in the presence of S aureus<pathogen> exoproducts.
