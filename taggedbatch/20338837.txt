 Charcot spinal arthropathy ( CSA) clearly represents a challenge in long-term spinal<disease> cord injury patients , one that can have extremely uncomfortable and potentially lethal outcomes if not managed properly. A 66-year-old man with a history of complete C7 quadriplegia presented with new-onset autonomic dysreflexia that resulted from Charcot spinal arthropathy ( CSA). Pathologic instability , in the atypical site of the mid-thoracic spine , spanning from the T8-T9 vertebral levels was appreciated on physical exam as an audible , palpable , and visible dynamic kyphosis; kyphosis was later confirmed on neuroimaging. Based on the CSA severity and sequelae , the patient underwent bilateral decompression laminectomy with lateral extracavitary arthrodesis and posterior instrumentation. Symptoms dramatically improved and at 1-year follow-up , dynamic thoracic kyphosis and most symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia had resolved. Based on our case and published reports , vigilant imaging and thorough physical examination in long-standing spinal<disease> cord injury could help early diagnosis and treatment of CSA , theoretically preventing development of cord atrophy and subsequent long-term sequelae. Surgical correction rather than bracing may be recommended in patients who have complete injury at or above T6 in patients with symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia associated with CSA confirmed on neuroimaging.
