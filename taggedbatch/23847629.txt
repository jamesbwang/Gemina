 Plants and in particular grasses benefit from a high uptake of silicon ( Si) which improves their growth and productivity by alleviating adverse effects of biotic and abiotic stress. However , the silicon present in plant tissues may have a negative impact on the processing and degradation of lignocellulosic biomass. Solutions to reduce the silicon content either by biomass engineering or development of downstream separation methods are therefore targeted. Different cell wall components have been proposed to interact with the silica pool in plant shoots , but the understanding of the underlying processes is still limited. In the present study , we have characterized silicon deposition and cell wall composition in We conclude that silicon affects the composition of plant cell walls , mostly by altering linkages of non-cellulosic polymers and lignin. The modifications of the cell wall network and the reduced silicon concentration appear to have little or no implications on biomass recalcitrance to enzymatic saccharification.
