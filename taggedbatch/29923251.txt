 Preclinical studies have suggested that proton pump inhibitors ( PPIs) may increase pancreatic cancer risk; however , epidemiological studies are few , with conflicting results. This spurred us to evaluate whether PPI use is associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in a large population-based study. We conducted a nationwide case-control study using data from Danish demographic and health care registries. All patients with a first cancer diagnosis of pancreatic cancer between 2000 and 2015 were identified from the Danish Cancer Registry and age-matched , sex-matched , and calendar-matched 1:20 to population controls using risk set sampling. Conditional logistic regression was applied to calculate odds ratios ( ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) for pancreatic cancer associated with PPI use , adjusting for potential confounders. Secondary analyses examined dose-response patterns and associations with individual PPIs as well as with histamine-2-receptor antagonists. Ever use of PPIs occurred among 27.8 % of 6921 pancreatic cancer cases and 25.4 % of 34 695 matched controls , yielding a neutral adjusted OR of 1.04 ( 95 % CI 0.97-1.11). Odds ratios were also close to unity in analyses of high use of PPIs ( â‰¥ 1000 DDDs; OR , 0.92 95 % CI 0.80-1.07). There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship , with ORs close to unity across categories , including for those with the highest cumulative use ( > 2000 DDDs; OR , 1.03 95 % CI 0.84-1.26). Analyses of subgroups as well as individual types of PPI and of histamine-2-receptor antagonists use also returned neutral associations. In this large nationwide case-control study , PPI use was not associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.
