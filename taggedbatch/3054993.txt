 With an intention to contribute to the issue of how language experience may influence working memory ( WM) , we focused on consecutive interpreting ( CI) , analyzed its potential links with WM functions and tested these links in a longitudinal experiment , trying to answer the specific question of how CI training may influence WM. Two comparable groups of Chinese learners of English received either CI or general second language ( L2) training for one semester , and were tested before and after the training with the tasks of n-back ( non-verbal updating) , L2 listening span , and letter running span ( verbal spans). CI performance was tested in the posttest. The results showed that ( 1) updating efficiency in both the pretest and posttest predicted CI performance , and CI training enhanced updating efficiency while general L2 training did not; ( 2) the relationship between verbal spans and CI performance was weaker ( i.e. , only pretest L2 listening span correlated with CI performance and predicted CI performance with marginal significance) , and CI training did not make a unique contribution to these spans ( i.e. , no group differences). The results indicated an `` interpreter advantage '' in updating , which was probably due to that updating was more central in the CI task than WM spans. Theoretically , we believe that updating and CI are closely related because they share the same underlying mechanism , or more specifically updating and the recalling process in the CI task share the same attentional control process , a unique link between updating and the CI task. Methodological implications are discussed.
