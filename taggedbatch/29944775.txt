 Graphene-based materials have recently attracted a great attention due to their extraordinary physical and chemical properties , which make them attractive candidates for many functional applications. Their chemical functionalization is key to tune properties. Here a novel two-steps synthesis enabling high degree of covalent GO 's functionalization is devised , thereby enabling the attachment of various robust functional molecules. Such process relies on the grafting of an ethylenediamine linker followed by the condensation reaction between aldehyde and amine groups forming imine bonds. As testbeds two kinds of graphene-based functional systems , i.e. porphyrin- and ferrocene-modified GO , are prepared. Such hybrid systems are characterized by various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The degree of functionalization results in the attachment of one porphyrin or ferrocene unit each 34 or 77 carbon atoms of GO scaffold , respectively , being much higher than values obtained upon using various established chemical approaches to functionalize GO , such as condensation , cycloaddition or coupling reactions. For the first time , the reduced form of ferrocene-modified GO was employed as electrode in supercapacitors , showing specific capacitance of 127 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 , with capacitance retention of â‰ˆ 93 % after 5000 cycles , demonstrating great potential in high-performance energy storage devices.
