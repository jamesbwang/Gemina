 The DNA origami method exploits the self-assembly property of nucleic acids to build diverse nanoscale systems. The all-atom molecular dynamics ( MD) method has emerged as a powerful computational tool for atomic-resolution characterization of the in situ structure and physical properties of DNA origami objects. This chapter provides step-by-step instructions for building atomic-scale models of DNA origami systems , using the MD method to simulate the models , and performing basic analyses of the resulting MD trajectories.
