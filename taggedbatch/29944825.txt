 Dye stabilized nanoemulsions offer the unique possibility of creating both silica capsules and sub-20-nm particles with precise control of particle size and narrow dispersity from the same system by the choice of the proper dye. The large o/w interface enhances the kinetics of particle formation significantly over macroscopic interfaces which enables the synthesis of silica nanoparticles without any catalyst or elevated temperatures under static conditions. This is in contrast to syntheses for sub-20-nm silica nanoparticles described until now which can normally not be conducted at neutral pH and/or room temperature without stirring. Furthermore , the synthesis can be run without any additional organic solvent and the dyes can be easily removed from the dispersion which opens the pathway to silica dispersions containing only particles , traces of ethanol and water at neutral pH without centrifugation , washing , or redispersion in accordance with the idea of `` green chemistry ''.
