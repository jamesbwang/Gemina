 MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are known to be crucial players in governing the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs). Despite their utter importance , identifying key lineage specifiers among the myriads of expressed miRNAs remains challenging. We believe that the current practice in mining miRNA specifiers via delineating dynamic fold-changes only is inadequate. Our study , therefore , provides evidence to pronounce `` lineage specificity '' as another important attribute to qualify for these lineage specifiers. Adopted hiPSCs were differentiated into representative lineages ( hepatic , nephric and neuronal) over all three germ layers whilst the depicted miRNA expression changes compiled into an integrated atlas. We demonstrated inter-lineage analysis shall aid in the identification of key miRNAs with lineage-specificity , while these shortlisted candidates were collectively known as `` lineage-specific miRNAs ''. Subsequently , we followed through the fold-changes along differentiation via computational analysis to identify miR-192 and miR-372-3p , respectively , as representative candidate key miRNAs for the hepatic and nephric lineages. Indeed , functional characterization validated that miR-192 and miR-372-3p regulate lineage differentiation via modulation of the expressions of lineage-specific genes. In summary , our presented miRNA atlas is a resourceful ore for the mining of key miRNAs responsible for lineage specification.
