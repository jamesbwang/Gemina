 Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II ( COUP-TFII) is a steroid receptor that is broadly expressed in many tissues throughout embryonic development. Previous studies indicated that COUP-TFII is dysregulated in multiple types of cancer and serves crucial roles in cancer development. The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 ( MPC1) is involved in transporting pyruvate for entry into the citric acid cycle , an important event in cancer progression. However , the roles of COUP-TFII and MPC1 in glioma remain unknown. In the present study , it was demonstrated that MPC1 is downregulated in glioblastoma. Furthermore , the inhibition of COUP-TFII was able to increase MPC1 expression and inhibit the growth of glioblastoma cells
