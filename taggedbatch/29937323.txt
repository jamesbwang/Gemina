 There may be short-term outcomes advantages for the intracorporeal approach to minimally invasive right colectomy. This is a retrospective propensity score-matched comparison of intracorporeal and extracorporeal techniques for robotic-assisted right colectomy in an Enhanced Recovery colorectal surgery service. 55 intracorporeal and 55 extracorporeal cases were compared. Operative time was significantly longer ( p < 0.001) and incision length shorter in the intracorporeal group ( p = 0.007). Outcomes significantly favorable for the intracorporeal group included conversion-to-open ( p = 0.013) , time to first flatus ( p < 0.001) , time to first bowel movement ( p = 0.006) , and dehydration<symptom> ( p = 0.03). There were more extraction site hernias in the midline compared to off-midline locations , though this difference did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.06). There are outcomes advantages for the intracorporeal technique for robotic-assisted right colectomy when compared to the extracorporeal approach for patients in an Enhanced Recovery Pathway. Training efforts should continue to advocate the intracorporeal option.
