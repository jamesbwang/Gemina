 We provide a review of the literature about the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome<disease><symptom> ( AIS) , its onset and associated developmental anomalies and the genetic alterations causing it. We searched PubMed with a larger emphasis on the physiology , genetics and current management of AIS. AIS is an X-linked recessive Disorder of Sex Development ( DSD). It is caused by mutations of the Androgen Receptor , and their large amount and heterogeneity ( missense and nonsense mutations , splicing variants , deletions , and insertions) are responsible for the wide spectrum of possible phenotypes of patients , divided into Partial AIS ( PAIS) and Complete AIS ( CAIS). Once the clinical and laboratory investigations have laid the foundation for a diagnostic hypothesis , it is important to identify the actual karyotype of the individual and search for the mutation in the Androgen Receptor to diagnose with certainty the syndrome<disease><symptom>. Alternatively , in the absence of such evidence , the diagnosis should more properly be an AIS-like condition , which we describe as well in our report. The management of this DSD is based on pharmacotherapies , surgery and psychological support: all of them must be directed to facilitate the patient 's life , considering his/her sexual identity.
