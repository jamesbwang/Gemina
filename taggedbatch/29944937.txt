 The inhibitory effect of 2,4,5-T , 2,4-D , glyphosate and paraquat on the diphenolase activity of mushroom tyrosinase for oxidation of L-DOPA has been investigated by kinetic measurements , fluorescence spectroscopy and computational docking analysis. 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D inhibit the diphenolase activity of the enzyme following a competitive mechanism , while glyphosate is a mixed inhibitor according to Lineweaver-Burk kinetic analysis. The inhibitory activity follows the order glyphosate > 2,4,5-T > 2,4-D with IC
