 Canadian universities are developing strategies to address the Truth and Reconciliation Commission ( TRC) Calls to Action. There has been much attention paid to the positivist , individualistic and Eurocentric foundations of nursing and its educational curricula , but limited focus on assessing organizational structures or engaging with stakeholders. Without both approaches , the success of new initiatives may be limited. The College of Nursing at the University of Saskatchewan implemented a `` Learn Where You Live '' model that demonstrated a sense of place by providing access and opportunity in rural , remote and northern regions of the province. Key to this initiative was the creation of the position of Strategist for Outreach and Indigenous Engagement , whose role it is to develop strategic initiatives designed to interpret and influence socio-political and policy-level system changes. This paper shares how adding a political scientist to nursing education created an interprofessional team by introducing new ways of thinking and being that have cultural relevance and understanding for a sustainable future.
