 Studies have suggested a possible autoimmune contribution in a subset of patients with schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to determine if a history of autoimmune diseases ( AD) is associated with an increased risk of later onset of schizophrenia. Taiwan 's National Health Insurance Research Database was used to identify a total of 64,817 AD patients and an equal number of age-matched control patients. The incidence rates of schizophrenia with a maximum follow-up period of 10 years between patients with and without AD were compared using a Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the hazard ratio ( HR) and 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI). The main finding was the discovery of a higher incidence of subsequent schizophrenia in patients with AD ( HR: 1.72 , 95 % CI: 1.23-2.4) after adjustment for other demographic characteristics. Specifically , the risk of schizophrenia was observed to be a significant increase in systemic lupus erythematosus ( 3.73 , 2.07-6.72) , rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> ( 2.89 , 1.97-4.23) , dermatomyositis ( 5.85 , 1.32-25.94) and autoimmune vasculitis ( 2.44 , 1.17-5.06). Also , this study revealed some potential risk factors for developing schizophrenia , including younger age ( less than or equal to 50 years) and some comorbidities ( hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and alcohol use disorder). Conversely , this study found that steroid use was a potential protective factor for the development of schizophrenia. This study found that AD were associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia , suggesting that the abnormal autoimmune process was associated with an increase in the expression of psychiatric disturbances.
