 The advent of next generation sequencing has enabled greater resolution of viral diversity and improved feasibility of full viral genome sequencing allowing routine HIV-1 full genome sequencing in both research and diagnostic settings. Regardless of the sequencing platform selected , successful PCR amplification of the HIV-1 genome is essential for sequencing template preparation. As such , full HIV-1 genome amplification is a crucial step in dictating the successful and reliable sequencing downstream. Here we reviewed existing PCR protocols leading to HIV-1 full genome sequencing. In addition to the discussion on basic considerations on relevant PCR design , the advantages as well as the pitfalls of published protocols were reviewed.
