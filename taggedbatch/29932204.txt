 We report the design and realization of yolk-shell structured nanospheres with periodic mesoporous organosilica ( PMO) nanospheres or noble metal nanoparticles encapsulated in mesoporous silica shells via a selective etching method. These architectures have well controlled structure , size and morphology. The yolk-shell structured PMO@SiO2 nanoparticles can be precisely functionalized with different catalytic functionalities , even incompatible acidic and basic groups: the PMO core with amino (- NH2) groups and the mesoporous silica shell with sulfonic acid (- SO3H) groups. As a nanoreactor , the as-synthesized Au@SiO2 nanospheres show faster reduction of 4-nitrophenol than that of nitrobenzene. Furthermore , the prepared PMO-NH2@SiO2-SO3H nanoparticles can be used as bifunctional catalysts with highly efficient catalytic performance for catalyzing the deacetalization-Henry cascade reaction.
