 Optimization of the types and timing of avoidance behaviors depending on the intensity of a noxious stimulus is essential for survival; however , processing in the central nervous system and its developmental basis are largely unknown. Here , we report that Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> preferentially selects one of three different types of avoidance behaviors depending on the strength of the noxious stimulus. We screened 210 neuronal transcription factors using a combination of optogenetics and RNA interference methods and identified 19 candidates required for avoidance behaviors. One candidate , gene lin-32 ( abnormal cell LINeage 32) , which encodes an atonal homolog , is required for the neural fate determination of AIB interneurons and functions by regulating the expression of electrical and chemical synapse genes , namely , inx-1 ( innexin 1) and AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor glr-1. When examined by Ca imaging , AIB showed an OFF calcium increase to the noxious stimulus. The OFF calcium increase was provoked only by strong stimulation , suggesting a role for optimization of the avoidance behavior. However , lin-32 mutants showed an impaired AIB OFF calcium increase , concomitant with a reduced occurrence of the dynamic avoidance behavior called the `` omega turn ''. The AIB neural responses may be transferred to downstream inter/motor neurons projecting to the neck<symptom> muscles via electrical synapses comprising inx-1. Finally , we found a correlation between powerful contractions of the neck<symptom> muscles and omega turns. Thus , the central regulation of the magnitude and timing of activation of the AIB interneurons optimizes the probability of omega turn depending on the stimulus context.
