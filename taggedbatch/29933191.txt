 For efficient hydrothermal treatment of biomass , this study aims to figure out the correlations between complex chemical constitution of orange peel ( OraPeel) as typical bio-waste and the physicochemical structure of its derived hydrochar , which could be utilized to adjust hydrochar properties for specific applications ( e.g. , adsorbent , fuel) by regulating respective proportions of each component in bio-waste. Cellulose , hemicellulose and lignin were used as the control variables of feedstocks composition in this work. After hydrothermal process , lignin added feedstock produced more hydrochar , which contained rougher surface with nearly doubled BET areas and more benzene rings. Hemicellulose-aided hydrochar possessed higher density of carbonaceous microspheres and richer hydroxyl. This char was simultaneously covered by more esters or lactones with more aromatic oxygen-containing groups inside. Similar to hemicellulose , cellulose improved the formation of diverse oxygenous groups but reduced the size of microspheres on hydrochar.
