 Lipoprotein ( a) ( Lp ( a)) elevation is a causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease ( CVD). It has however been suggested that elevated Lp ( a) causes CVD mainly in individuals with high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C) levels. We hypothesized that the risk associated with high Lp ( a) levels would largely be attenuated at low LDL-C levels. In 16 654 individuals from the EPIC-Norfolk prospective population study , and in 9448 individuals from the Copenhagen City Heart Study ( CCHS) parallel statistical analyses were performed. Individuals were categorized according to their Lp ( a) and LDL-C levels. Cut-offs were set at the 80th cohort percentile for Lp ( a). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol cut-offs were set at 2.5 , 3.5 , 4.5 , and 5.5 mmol/L. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the primary analyses were corrected for Lp ( a)- derived LDL-C ( LDL-Ccorr). Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were calculated for each category. The category with LDL-Ccorr < 2.5 mmol/L and Lp ( a) < 80th cohort percentile was used as reference category. In the EPIC-Norfolk and CCHS cohorts , individuals with an Lp ( a) ≥ 80th percentile were at increased CVD risk compared with those with Lp ( a) < 80th percentile for any LDL-Ccorr levels ≥ 2.5 mmol/L. In contrast , for LDL-Ccorr < 2.5 mmol/L , the risk associated with elevated Lp ( a) attenuated. However , there was no interaction between LDL-Ccorr and Lp ( a) levels on CVD risk in either cohort. Lipoprotein ( a) and LDL-C are independently associated with CVD risk. At LDL-C levels below < 2.5 mmol/L , the risk associated with elevated Lp ( a) attenuates in a primary prevention setting.
