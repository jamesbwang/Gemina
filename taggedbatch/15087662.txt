 Sarcomatoid differentiation in renal cell carcinoma ( sRCC) is histologically characterized by anaplastic changes of renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) subtypes , which has been associated with a poor prognosis. sRCC is managed more aggressively than RCC without sarcomatoid components , so pre-operative detection of sarcomatoid differentiation would significantly affect surgical management. The purpose of this study is to compare the quantification of sarcomatoid features in RCCs on pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) to standard histological examination. Patients who had nephrectomy at our institution between 2000 and 2015 with pathology proven RCC and pre-operative contrast enhanced MRI abdominal scans were retrospectively reviewed. A custom MATLAB routine calculated the portion of each manually segmented whole tumor with MRI signal suggestive of sarcomatoid involvement based on prior research ( MRI % SARC). The primary endpoint compared MRI % SARC to percent sarcomatoid involvement estimated by histological examination ( HIST % SARC) using Pearson correlation and Bland Altman analysis. A total of 17 patients with sRCC ( 10 males , age 60.3 ± 11.1 years) and 17 consecutive control patients with clear cell RCC ( ccRCC) without sarcomatoid components ( 10 males , age 64.5 ± 7.6 years) were evaluated. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a strong association between MRI % SARC and HIST % SARC ( r = 0.782 , P < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated proportional bias , with a mean bias of 19.29 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 9.79-28.79) and with 95 % limits of agreement of -16.93 ( 95 % CI: -33.38 to -0.48) to 55.51 ( 95 % CI: 39.06-71.96) , suggesting MRI % SARC underestimated values compared to HIST % SARC by 19 %. Multiparametric pre-operative MRI analysis to quantify sarcomatoid features in RCC correlates with standard histological examination but underestimates percent sarcomatoid involvement.
