 To explore the effect of NLRP1 on the liver dysfunction following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT). The mouse model of allo-HSCT was established by using C57BL/6 and NLRP The chimera rate was over 96 % on the day 14 after allo-HSCT , and showed that the hematopoietic stem cells of donors had been transplanted into recipients. ALT and AST levels were increased from ( 173.9 ± 12.39) U/L and ( 283.7 ± 28.00) U/L on day 7 to ( 3902 ± 1745) U/L and ( 5316 ± 924) U/L on the day 14 and decreased to ( 3153 ± 564.4) U/L and ( 4350 ± 957.7) U/L on the day 28 , respectively. Western blot showed that the expression of NLRP1 was increased after allo-HSCT , which displayed a similar trend with the changes of ALT and AST. When knocking out NLRP1 , the contents of ALT and AST in the knocked group were significantly decreased in comparison with the group without knocking out. And the expression levels of NLRP1 related inflammatory proteins , precursor of Caspase-1 , p20,Mature-IL-1β , Mature-IL-18 and MPO were lower than those in groups without knocking out NLRP1 gene. Allo-HSCT can cause the damage of liver function and increase the expression of NLRP1 , while knocking out NLRP1 can reduce the damage of liver function , so NLRP1 may be one of the important factors leading to liver dysfunction.
