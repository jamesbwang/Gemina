 Phosphorylated histone 3 ( PH3) and cleaved caspase 3 ( CCASP3) were used to detect proliferating and apoptotic cells , respectively , in the jejunums<symptom> of female sibling poults , with and without enteritis<disease><symptom> and depressed growth , from hatch to day 35. Poults that developed enteritis<disease><symptom> and depressed growth ( SIB flock) were raised on a commercial farm in eastern North Carolina , whereas poults with normal growth and no enteritis<disease><symptom> ( TAU flock) were raised in the Teaching Animal Unit at North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine. Beginning on day 5 through day 35 and at processing , TAU poults were significantly heavier than SIB poults. Jejunal weights , relative jejunal weights , and jejunal densities were greater in SIB poults from day 10 through 35. Jejunal efficiency ( body<symptom> weight/ jejunal length) was higher in TAU poults at day 5 and days 10 through 35. Mucosal thickness was greater in SIB poults between days 7 and 21 but greater in TAU poults at days 28 and 35. From day 7 to 35 , villus-to-crypt ratios were higher for TAU poults and lower for SIB poults because hyperplastic crypts formed a greater percentage of the mucosa in SIB poults. By day 7 , PH3- and CCASP3-positive cells were increased in SIB poults , showing that mucosal changes resulted from combined crypt epithelial<disease> hyperplasia<disease> and increased apoptosis of villous enterocytes. Findings in this study confirm that enteritis<disease><symptom> , in the absence of clinical signs , and depressed growth in turkey poults begins by day 7 , can be identified microscopically , persists for at least 35 days , is associated with lower processing weights , and has a profound negative effect on turkey growth.
