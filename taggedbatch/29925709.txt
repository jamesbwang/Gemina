 The aim was to compare the peri-implant clinical and radiographic inflammatory parameters and whole salivary cotinine levels among cigarette smokers ( CS) , waterpipe smokers ( WS) and never-smokers ( NS). Thirty-four CS ( Group 1) , 33 WS ( Group 2) , and 31 NS ( Group 3) were included. Peri-implant plaque index ( PI) , bleeding-on-probing ( BOP) , and probing depth ( PD) were measured , and crestal bone loss ( CBL) was assessed on standardized digital radiographs. Unstimulated whole saliva samples were collected and whole salivary cotinine levels were measured. Peri-implant PI and PD were higher in Groups 1 ( P < 0.05) and 2 ( P < 0.05) than in Group 3. Peri-implant BOP was significantly higher in Group 3 than in Groups 1 ( P < 0.01) and 2 ( P < 0.01). Peri-implant MBL was significantly higher in Groups 1 ( P < 0.05) and 2 ( P < 0.05) than in Group 3. There were significant differences in PI , BOP , PD , and CBL between Groups 1 and 2. There was no significant difference in the whole salivary cotinine levels in Groups 1 and 2. Peri-implant sites with plaque accumulation , PD , CBL , and whole salivary cotinine levels were higher in CS and WS than in NS , but did not differ between CS and WS.
