 Cavum Septum Pellucidum ( CSP) is a common anatomical variant of the septum pellucidum. CSP is considered a marker for abnormal limbic brain development , but its functional consequences are non-specific. In a recent report ( Crooks et al. , 2018) , CSP size was significantly positively correlated with the affective/interpersonal traits of psychopathy in male offenders ( N = 1742). Here we test the hypothesis that CSP is related to psychopathic traits in incarcerated females ( N = 355). We examine continuous relationships as well as categorical assignments for CSP size corresponding to a number of prior reports. We also compare female offenders to healthy female controls ( N = 385). Consistent with our reported findings in males , a positive association was observed between the interpersonal psychopathic traits and CSP size. In contrast to findings among males , an association between CSP and antisocial psychopathic traits was apparent in females. There was no significant difference in CSP size ( in mm) or CSP presence/absence between incarcerated and non-incarcarated groups. However , categorical rates of medium and large CSP were more common in female inmates than in controls. This is the first systematic investigation of these variables in a female inmate sample. In combination with our prior study , these findings demonstrate that limbic abnormalities , as indexed by CSP , are related to psychopathic traits in both female and male inmates.
