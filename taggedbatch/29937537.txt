 Introduction: Lung cancer ( LC) has been one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide , both in terms of new cases and mortality. Exponential growth of economic and industrial activities in recent decades in the Delhi urban area may have increased the incidence of LC. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the time trend according to gender. Method: LC incidence data over 25 years were obtained from the population based urban Delhi cancer registry. Joinpoint regression analysis was applied for evaluating the time trend of age-standardized incidence rates. The age-period-cohort ( APC) model was employed using Poisson distribution with a log link function and the intrinsic estimator method. Results: During the 25 years , 13,489 male and 3,259 female LC cases were registered , accounting for 9.78 % of male and 2.53 % of female total cancer cases. Joinpoint regression analysis revealed that LC incidence in males continued to increase during the entire period , a sharp acceleration being observed starting from 2009. In females the LC incidence rate remained a plateau during 1988-2002 and thereafter increased. The cumulative risks for 1988-2012 were 1.79 % and 0.45 %. The full APC ( IE) model showed best fit for an age-period-cohort effect on LC incidence , with significant increase with age peaking at 70-74 years in males and 65-69 years in females. A rising period effect was observed after adjusting for age and cohort effects in both genders and a declining cohort effect was identified after controlling for age and period effects. Conclusion: The incidence of LC in urban Delhi showed increasing trend from 1988-2012. Known factors such as environmental conservation , tobacco control , physical activity awareness and medical security should be implemented more vigorously over the long term in our population.
