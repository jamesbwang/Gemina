 Congenital cataract , opacification of the ocular lens , is clinically and genetically a heterogeneous childhood disease. In this study we aimed to identify the underlying genetic cause of isolated autosomal-dominant lamellar cataract in a multi-generation English family. Whole-genome sequencing ( WGS) was undertaken in two affected subjects and one unaffected individual. Segregation analysis was performed and a known cataract-causing mutation was identified. Segregation was further validated by sanger sequencing in the entire pedigree. A heterozygous mutation c. 7 G > T; p.D3Y was identified in an NH We have identified a recurrent mutation in GJA3 in a large British pedigree causing the novel phenotype of autosomal-dominant congenital lamellar cataract. Previously , p.D3Y was found in a Hispanic family causing pulverulent cataract. WGS proved an efficient method to find the underlying molecular cause in this large family , which could not be mapped due to uninformative markers.
