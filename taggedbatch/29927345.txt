 Eisosomes are lipid domains of the yeast plasma membrane that share similarities to caveolae of higher eukaryotes. Eisosomes harbor APC-type nutrient transporters for reasons which are poorly understood. Our analyses support the model that eisosomes function as storage compartments , keeping APC transporters in a stable , inactive state. By regulating eisosomes , yeast is able to balance the number of proton-driven APC transporters with the proton pumping activity of Pma1 , thereby maintaining the plasma membrane proton gradient. Environmental or metabolic changes that disrupt the proton gradient cause the rapid restructuring of eisosomes and results in the removal of the APC transporters from the cell surface. Furthermore , we show evidence that eisosomes require the presence of APC transporters , suggesting that regulating activity of nutrient transporters is a major function of eisosomes.
