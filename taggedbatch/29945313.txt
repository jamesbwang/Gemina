 Pro-gastrin-releasing peptide ( ProGRP) is a kind of tumor marker applied more and more commonly in recent years. This study was aimed at determining the age and gender-specific reference intervals ( RIs) for ProGRP in healthy Han ethnic adults from Guangxi , China. A total of 2,045 apparently healthy males and 1,740 apparently healthy females aged from 21 to 90 years were included in this study. The serum ProGRP values were determined by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay ( ECLIA). The one-sided upper 95th percentile of ProGRP concentrations were used to define the RIs. The reference limits in different age groups ( 21- 40 , 41- 50 , 51- 60 , 61- 70 , and > 70 years) were 37.3 , 39.7 , 45.7 , 47.3 , and 61.3 pg/mL for males , and 36.3 , 38.1 , 42.7 , 53.5 , and 60.1 pg/mL for females , respectively. There was no significant difference in the levels of ProGRP between males and females. The serum ProGRP levels were positively correlated with age. We established the age and gender-specific RIs for ProGRP in the adults from Guangxi , China. It will be valuable for future clinical and laboratory studies.
