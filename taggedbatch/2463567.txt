 A 64-year-old man with a history of congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> secondary to nonischemic cardiomyopathy , mitral and aortic valve replacements , and biventricular cardioverter-defibrillator placement , developed a tachycardia<symptom>. The tachycardia<symptom> exhibited a biventricular paced rhythm with a short R-P interval and concentric atrial activation sequence within the coronary sinus , suggesting that the tachycardia<symptom> might be a pacemaker-mediated tachycardia<symptom> ( PMT). However , the tachycardia<symptom> was diagnosed as counterclockwise cavotricuspid isthmus ( CTI)- dependent atrial flutter ( AFL) , and linear ablation of the CTI eliminated the tachycardia<symptom>. This case illustrated that typical AFL can mimic a PMT when there is a severe conduction delay through the CTI.
