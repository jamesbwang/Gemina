 Severe droughts have caused widespread tree mortality across many forest<disease> biomes with profound effects on the function of ecosystems and carbon balance<symptom>. Climate change is expected to intensify regional-scale droughts , focusing attention on the physiological basis of drought-induced tree mortality. Recent work has shown that catastrophic failure of the plant hydraulic system is a principal mechanism involved in extensive crown death and tree mortality during drought , but the multi-dimensional response of trees to desiccation is complex. Here we focus on the current understanding of tree hydraulic performance under drought , the identification of physiological thresholds that precipitate mortality and the mechanisms of recovery after drought. Building on this , we discuss the potential application of hydraulic thresholds to process-based models that predict mortality.
