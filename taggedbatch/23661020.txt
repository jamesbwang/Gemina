 Polymorphisms of the renin angiotensin system ( RAS) are associated with increases in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP). Physical exercise has been considered the main strategy to prevent this increase. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between estimated training status ( TS) , BP and angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE) activity in elderly people classified as low or high risk to develop hypertension according to genetic profile. A total of 155 elderly participants performed the following assessments: general functional fitness index ( GFFI) , systolic BP ( SBP) and diastolic BP ( DBP) , blood collection for ACE activity and analyses of the RAS polymorphisms. Uncontrolled hypertensive ( UHT) participants presented higher values of SBP and DBP compared with normotensive ( NT) and controlled hypertensive ( CHT) participants. No differences were found in ACE activity and GFFI between groups. In the high risk group , UHT presented higher values of SBP and DBP compared with other groups. CHT presented higher values of SBP compared with NT. Furthermore , UHT presented higher values of ACE activity compared with CHT and lower values of GFFI compared with NT. MDA , TIA and TIC genetic combinations were associated with high risk of developing hypertension while the maintenance of good levels of TS was associated with lower BP values and ACE activity.
