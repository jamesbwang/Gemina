 Suicide rates are higher in rural and remote areas of Australia compared with major cities. To evaluate the impact of a brief , community-based suicide prevention educational intervention on the attitudes and confidence of rural South Australian health and human service professionals. Participants attended a 1-day suicide prevention education program , and completed a survey at four time points: baseline ( T1) , immediately pretraining ( T2) , immediately posttraining ( T3) , and 4-month follow-up ( T4). Main outcome measures were self-reported attitudes and confidence when working with people vulnerable to suicide. A total of 248 people attended the training , with 213 participants completing the survey at T1 , 236 at T2 , 215 at T3 , and 172 at T4. There were significant improvements in 11 of the 14 attitude items between T2 and T3 ( immediate change) , and between T1 and T4 ( maintained change). Further , there were significant improvements in all four confidence items between T2 and T3 , and T1 and T4. Despite the repeated-measures design , findings are limited by the lack of a control group. Findings extend the international evidence by indicating the value of brief suicide prevention education for improving health and human service professionals ' attitudes and confidence in rural Australia.
