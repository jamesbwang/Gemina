 Bacterial infection is one of the most severe postoperative complications leading to clinical orthopedic implants failure. To improve the antibacterial property of titanium ( Ti) substrates , a bioactive coating composed of chitosan-1- ( hydroxymethyl)- 5,5-dimethylhydantoin ( Chi-HDH-Cl) and gelatin ( Gel) was fabricated via layer-by-layer ( LBL) assembly technique. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR) , nuclear magnetic resonance (
