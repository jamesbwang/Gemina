 The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an arduous one-week military course on measures of physical performance , body composition and blood biomarkers. Participants were apprentices in an annual selection course for the Norwegian Special Forces. Fifteen soldiers ( 23 ± 4 yrs. , 1.81 ± 0.06 m , 78 ± 7 kg) completed a hell-week consisting of rigorous activity only interspersed by 2-3 hours of sleep per day. Testing was conducted before and 0 , 1 , 3 , 7 and 14 days after the hell-week. Physical performance was measured as muscle strength and jump performance. Body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance and blood samples were collected and analyzed for hormones , creatine kinase , and C-reactive protein. Body mass was reduced by 5.3 ± 1.9 kg during the hell-week and returned to baseline within one week. Fat mass was reduced by 2.1 ± 1.7 kg and muscle mass by 1.9 ± 0.9 kg. Muscle strength in leg-press and bench-press was reduced by 20 ± 9 % and 9 ± 7 % , respectively , and both were ~ 10 % lower than baseline after one week of recovery. Jump-height was reduced by 28 ± 13 % and was still 14 ± 5 % below baseline after 2 weeks of recovery. Testosterone was reduced by 70 ± 12 % and recovered gradually within a week. Cortisol was increased by 154 ± 74 % , and did not fully recover during the next week. IGF-1 was reduced by 51 ± 10 % and T3 and T4 by 12-30 % , all recovered within a week. One-week arduous military exercise resulted in reductions in body mass and performance , as well as considerable hormonal disturbances. Our most important observation was that whereas the hormonal systems was normalized within one week of rest and proper nutrition , lower body strength and jump performance were still depressed after two weeks.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
