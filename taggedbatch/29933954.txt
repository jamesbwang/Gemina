 Early developmental exposure to ethanol , a known teratogen , can result in a range of neurodevelopmental disorders , collectively referred to as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders ( FASDs). Changes in the environment , including exposure to teratogens , can result in long term alterations to the epigenetic landscape of a cell , thereby altering gene expression. Noncoding RNAs ( ncRNAs) can affect transcription and translation of networks of genes. ncRNAs are dynamically expressed during development and have been identified as a target of alcohol. ncRNAs therefore make for attractive targets for novel therapeutics to address the developmental deficits associated with FASDs.
