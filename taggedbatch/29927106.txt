 Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies ( ACPA) have proven highly useful as biomarkers in rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> ( RA). However , the composition and functionality of the associated autoreactive B cell repertoire have not been directly assessed. We aimed to selectively investigate citrullinated autoantigen-specific B cell receptors ( BCRs) involved in RA and initiate studies on their pathogenicity. A University of Minnesota ACPA Using citrullinated peptide tetramer-enrichment to investigate single autoreactive blood B cells , we identified biased V-region gene usage and conserved junction arrangements in RA subject BCRs. Parsimonious clustering of related immunoglobulin gene nucleotide sequences revealed clonal expansions of rare individual B cell clades in parallel with divergent sequence mutations. Correspondingly , recombinant mAbs generated from such BCR lineages demonstrated citrulline-dependent cross-reactivity extending beyond the citrullinated peptides used for B cell capture. A pair of citrullinated autoantigen-specific mAbs with cross-reactive binding profiles also promoted arthritis<disease><symptom> in mice. Our findings suggest that broad ACPA specificities in RA arise from a restricted repertoire of evolving citrulline-multispecific B cell clades with pathogenic potential.
