 Surface phase heterogeneity within a fully charged LiCoO2 ( LCO) composite electrode before and after thermal decomposition has been shown to strongly depend on the distribution of the binder and carbon additives , but be independent of the crystalline facet and size of LCO , as revealed by X-ray photoemission electron microscopy ( X-PEEM). The obtained new insights deepen the understanding of thermal stability in a real composite electrode , which would be valuable for further development of long-life and safe cathodes for lithium-ion batteries.
