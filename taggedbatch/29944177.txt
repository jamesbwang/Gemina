 We report the preparation of hierarchical porous carbon sponges ( HCS) from metal oxide nanoparticle@metal-organic frameworks. ZnO nanoparticles are partially converted to zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 ( ZIF-8) crystals in presence of n-butylamine , obtaining ZnO@ZIF-8 porous hybrids. After direct carbonization , followed by ZnO acidic etching , ZnO@ZIF-8 crystals were converted to submicrometric HCS. Due to the high surface area and accessible porosity combining micro- and mesoporosity of HCS , their application for the extraction of water pollutants was studied preparing HCS/polymer membranes<symptom> , showing a high efficiency for the fast ( 650 L m-2 h-1) removal of plastic degradation by-products ( DBP , dibutyl phthalate. DEHP , bis ( 2-n-ehtylhexyl) phthalate). DBP and DEHP breakthroughs were lower than 3 % after the filtration of 100 mL of water containing simultaneously both phthalates at a high concentration level ( 300 Âµg L-1 , each). HCS/polymer membranes<symptom> were reusable up to 5 times maintaining their extraction capacity , with relative errors of 6 % for DBP , and < 1 % for DEHP.
