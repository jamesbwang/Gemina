 Palliative radiotherapy to patients with head and neck cancer is often necessary , but there is a substantial variation in the treatment regimens reported in the literature , and consensus on the most appropriate schedules does not exist. In order to minimize acute toxicity while at the same time trying to achieve prolonged tumor control , a long hypofractionated regimen has been used routinely in Denmark. In the current retrospective study , we investigated the outcome in patients intended for palliative radiotherapy with this regimen. Patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancer treated with palliative radiotherapy of 52-56 Gy in 13-14 fractions twice weekly from 2009 to 2014 were included. Patients were excluded if they had previously received radiotherapy. Data on disease location , stage , patient performance status ( PS) , treatment response , acute skin and mucosal toxicity , and late fibrosis<disease> were collected prospectively and supplemented with information from medical records. 77 patients were included in the study. Fifty-eight patients ( 75 %) completed the intended treatment. Loco-regional tumor response ( complete or partial) was evaluated 2 months posttreatment and observed in 45 % of the entire population corresponding to 71 % of patients alive. PS had a significant influence on survival ( Palliative hypofractionated radiotherapy with 52-56 Gy in 13-14 fractions shows good tumor response and tolerability in a vulnerable patient population. However , it may not be suited for patients in poor PS.
