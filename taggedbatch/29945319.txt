 Pseudothrombocytopenia , caused by platelet ( PLT) clumping , is often found in clinical studies ( 1). However , pseudothrombocytosis resulting from the fragmentation of red blood cells ( RBCs) is a very rare phenomenon. EDTA-K2 anticoagulation was used on a sample of venous blood extracted from the patient. A Symex XN9000 automatic blood analyzer was used to conduct CBC + DIFF mode and CBC + DIFF + RET mode tests , stained smear microscopy. The Symex XN9000 automatic blood analyzer was used to conduct CBC + DIFF mode test; PLTs were measured at 570 x 109/L. Stained smear microscopy revealed the number of PLTs did not conform to the instrument measured 570 x 109/L. `` RET '' alarm instrument , switch to CBC + DIFF + RET mode for testing. The second test result showed PLTs at 128 x 109/L , which accords with artificial microscopy. This was a case of a very rare phenomenon: the fragmentation of RBCs caused pseudothrombocytosis.
