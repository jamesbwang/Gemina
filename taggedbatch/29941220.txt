 Sézary syndrome<disease><symptom> is a rare aggressive leukemic variant of primary<disease> cutaneous T-cell lymphoma , typically presenting with erythroderma , lymphadenopathy<disease><symptom> , and an atypical clonal T-cell population. Though it often involves the spleen and liver , we report a case of Sézary syndrome<disease><symptom> with renal<symptom> involvement<symptom> that was treated successfully. Visceral involvement confers a poor prognosis requiring systemic treatment. The patient we describe was a 66-year-old man who was referred from Dermatology services for deteriorating kidney function. Polymerase chain reaction of genomic DNA from skin and kidney biopsies confirmed a clonal T-cell population matching a population isolated in peripheral blood. The patient was treated initially with alemtuzumab , which led to a significant improvement in kidney function , and he has subsequently received a successful allogeneic stem cell transplant. This case represents a rare cause of decreased kidney function and highlights the role of biopsy in patients with suspected Sézary syndrome<disease><symptom>.
