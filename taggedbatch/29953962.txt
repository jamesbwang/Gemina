 Colorectal cancer ( CRC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide. Biomarkers that can facilitate better clinical management of CRC are in high demand to improve patient outcome and to reduce mortality. In this regard , proteomic analysis holds a promising prospect in the hunt of novel biomarkers for CRC and in understanding the mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. This review aims to provide an overview of the current progress of proteomic research , focusing on discovery and validation of diagnostic biomarkers for CRC. We will summarize the contributions of proteomic strategies to recent discoveries of protein biomarkers for CRC and also briefly discuss the potential and challenges of different proteomic approaches in biomarker discovery and translational applications.
