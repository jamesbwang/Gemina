 Exposure to sexual assault is a significant risk factor to develop post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) in females. The early neurobiological changes leading to the development of PTSD remain understudied and unclear in this population. Participants were 27 adult females recruited within a month following exposure to sexual assault ( T1) and 20 age-matched non-exposed controls. Among the victims , 10 participants met ( PTSD +) and 15 did not meet ( PTSD-) DSM-IV criteria for PTSD 6 months post-trauma ( T2). At both visits , hippocampal and amygdala volumes were extracted from magnetic resonance imaging scans , and indices of total diurnal cortisol changes were derived from individual areas under the curve relative to the ground ( AUCg). Measures at T1 were compared between groups at T1 , measures at T2 between groups at T2 , and measures at T1 between groups at T2. At T1 , victims had significantly smaller bilateral hippocampal volumes , but not AUCg , than controls. At T2 , neither hippocampal volume nor AUCg significantly differed among the groups. However , the PTSD + group had significantly smaller hippocampal volumes at T1 than the control group , but not compared to the PTSD- group. This study indicates that having smaller hippocampal volumes is a risk factor to develop PTSD in females exposed to sexual assault.
