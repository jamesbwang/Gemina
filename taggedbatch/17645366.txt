 Atomic force microscope ( AFM) based single molecule force spectroscopy ( SMFS) is a valuable tool in biophysics to investigate the ligand-receptor interactions , cell adhesion and cell mechanics. However , the force spectroscopy data analysis needs to be done carefully to extract the required quantitative parameters correctly. Especially the large number of molecules , commonly involved in complex networks formation; leads to very complicated force spectroscopy curves. One therefore , generally characterizes the total dissipated energy over a whole pulling cycle , as it is difficult to decompose the complex force curves into individual single molecule events. However , calculating the energy dissipation directly from the transformed force spectroscopy curves can lead to a significant over-estimation of the dissipated energy during a pulling experiment. The over-estimation of dissipated energy arises from the finite stiffness of the cantilever used for AFM based SMFS. Although this error can be significant , it is generally not compensated for. This can lead to significant misinterpretation of the energy dissipation ( up to the order of 30 %). In this paper , we show how in complex SMFS the excess dissipated energy caused by the stiffness of the cantilever can be identified and corrected using a high throughput algorithm. This algorithm is then applied to experimental results from molecular networks and cell-adhesion measurements to quantify the improvement in the estimation of the total energy dissipation.
