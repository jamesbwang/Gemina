 The overexploitation of shark and ray fishing as well as anthropogenic pollution in the sea has led to a large decline in their population , and because sharks occupy a high trophic position in the ecosystem , they could have high concentrations of heavy metals such as Hg , Pb , and Cd. This study is based on seven species of demersal sharks which were caught in the Macaronesian archipelagos ( Tenerife , Gran Canaria , and the Azores Archipelago). Hg and Pb concentrations were found in the present study to be below those reported in other comparative studies , with the highest reported values of Hg and Pb being 281,738 μg/kg for Pb in Deania profundorum ( Smith & Radcliffe , 1912) and 264,30 μg/kg for Hg in Centrophorus uyato , Rafinesque , 1810. As for Cd , the values found here are higher than those in the literature , the highest reported concentration being 120.36 μg/kg in Centrophorus squamosus ( Bonnaterre , 1788).
