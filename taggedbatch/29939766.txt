 It is difficult to identify the gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs) intracellularly due to their non-fluorescent nature. Although gold can quench the fluorescence of any fluorophore , hence it is also difficult to combine gold with a fluorophore such as a semiconductor quantum dots ( QDs). The aim of this study was to prepare a single fluorescent stable AuNPs combined with QDs ( QDs-Au-NPs) which can be easily detected intracellularly. QDs-Au-NPs were prepared via a simple one-step process through controlling the spacing between them using polyethylene glycol ( PEG) as space linker in the form of PEGylated QDs. Furthermore , the applicability of this system was evaluated after coating the particles with somatostatin citrate , SST , to active target somatostatin receptors ( SSTRs) , and identification of the internalized particles via confocal laser scanning spectroscopy. The results showed that the produced Au shell has a thickness of 2.0 ± 0.2 nm and QDs-Au-NPs showed the same fluorescence intensity compared to the unmodified QDs. Additionally , a stable monodisperse QDs-Au-NPs coated with SST were prepared after coating with 11-Mercaptoundecanoic acid. Moreover , cellular uptake study in Human Caucasian breast adenocarcinoma cell lines showed that QDs-Au-SST-NPs could be detected easily using the confocal microscope. In addition , they showed a significant ( p ≤ .05) internalization per cell compared to untreated QDs-Au-NPs as detected by flow cytometry. It could be concluded that the produced QDs-Au-NPs has a strong fluorescence property like QDs which enable them to be easily detected after cells internalization.
