 The present study was conducted to assess gender difference in the relationship between the ferritin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR) and beta cell function ( HOMA-B) in non-diabetic Korean adults. A sample including 5,414 adults ( 2,279 men , 1,529 postmenopausal women , and 1,606 premenopausal women) aged ≥ 20 years from the fifth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( KNHANES V-1 , 2010) was analyzed. There were several key findings in the present study. First , in men , HOMA-IR ( β = 0.119 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 3.304 to 8.003) constituted the independent factor determining ferritin , but this was not the case for HOMA-B ( β = -0.042 , 95 % CI , -0.100 to 0.011). Second , in postmenopausal women , HOMA-IR ( β = 0.087 , 95 % CI , 0.899 to 5.238) was the independent factor determining ferritin , but this was not the case for HOMA-B ( β = -0.043 , 95 % CI , -0.065 to 0.010). Third , in premenopausal women , neither HOMA-IR ( β = -0.050 , 95 % CI , -3.056 to 0.364) nor HOMA-B ( β = -0.009 , 95 % CI , -0.028 to 0.020) constituted the independent factors determining ferritin. Ferritin was positively associated with insulin resistance in non-diabetic Korean men and postmenopausal women , but not in non-diabetic Korean premenopausal women.
