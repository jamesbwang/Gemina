 No previous study has examined the associations between egg consumption and prevalence of psychological disorders. The present study was conducted to determine the association between egg consumption and depression<symptom> in a large sample of Iranian adults. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 3172 adults in Isfahan , Iran. Egg consumption was assessed by using a validated , self-administered , dish-based , semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The Iranian validated version of Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale was used to screen for anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom>. The Iranian validated version of General Health Questionnaire with 12 items was used to assess psychological distress. Depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> and psychological distress were defined according to standard criteria. The mean age of the study participants was 36.5 Â± 7.9 years. Depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> and psychological distress were prevalent among 28.4 , 13.6 and 23 % of the study subjects , respectively. After controlling for potential confounders , no significant association was observed between egg intake and depression<symptom> ( OR for comparing extreme quartiles: 1.08; 95 % CIs 0.80-1.45) and anxiety<symptom> ( OR 0.79; 95 % CIs 0.54-1.16) , as well as psychological distress ( OR 1.03; 95 % CIs 0.76-1.41) in the whole population. In men , significant positive associations were observed between egg intake and depression<symptom> before controlling for BMI ( OR 1.68; 95 % CIs 1.01-2.80); however , the associations became non-significant after taking BMI into account ( OR 1.62; 95 % CIs 0.96-2.72). We found no significant association between egg intake and psychological disorders. Further studies , in particular of prospective design , are warranted.
