 Chemotherapy is an important adjuvant therapy for epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC). The main cause of chemotherapy failure in EOC is paclitaxel resistance. The present study aimed to identify novel biomarkers to predict chemosensitivity to paclitaxel and improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying paclitaxel resistance in EOC. In the present study , the heterogeneity of EOC was evaluated by adenosine triphosphate-tumor chemosensitivity assay ( ATP-TCA)
