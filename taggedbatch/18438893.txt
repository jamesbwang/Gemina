 Low<symptom> back pain ( LBP) is a common complaint among patients presenting to emergency department ( ED) in Singapore. The STarT Back Screening Tool ( SBT) was recently developed and validated for triage of LBP patients in primary care settings. This study aimed to investigate whether the SBT could provide prognostic information for long-term outcomes of acute LBP patients visiting the ED , who might benefit from appropriate and timely management at an earlier stage.Data were collected in a prospective observational cohort study from 177 patients who consulted emergency physicians for acute LBP and completed 6-month follow-up. Patients were administered the SBT and assessed at baseline. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6 weeks and 6 months.A multiple linear regression model incorporating SBT total score , age , employment status , LBP history , and 6-week pain score was constructed to predict 6-month pain score. In the model , SBT total score and 6-week pain score were significantly associated with 6-month pain score ( P < .05) with respective coefficients of 0.125 and 0.500. The model explained 40.1 % of the variance for 6-month pain score.This study demonstrated that the multiple linear regression model showed predictive performance in determining long-term outcomes for acute LBP patients presenting to the ED.
