 This study examined test-retest reliabilities and ( predictors of) practice effects of the widely used computerized neuropsychological battery CNS Vital Signs. The sample consisted of 158 Dutch healthy adults. At 3 and 12 months follow-up , 131 and 77 participants were retested. Results revealed low<symptom> to high test-retest reliability coefficients for CNS VS ' test and domain scores. Participants scored significantly higher on the domains of Cognitive Flexibility , Processing Speed , and Reaction Time at the 3-month retest. No significant differences in performance were found over the second interval. Age , education , and retest-interval were not significantly associated with practice effects. These results highlight the need for methods that evaluate performance over time while accounting for imperfect test-retest reliabilities and practice effects. We provided RCI-formulae for determining reliable change , which may be possible solution for future work facing the methodological issues of retesting. ( PsycINFO Database Record
