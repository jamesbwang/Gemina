 Septic shock<symptom> is a highly heterogeneous condition which is part of the challenge in its diagnosis and treatment. In this study we aim to identify clinically relevant subphenotypes of septic shock<symptom> using a novel statistic al approach. Baseline patient data from a large global clinical trial of septic shock<symptom> ( n = 1696) was analysed using latent class analysis ( LCA). This approach allowed investigators to identify subgroups in a heterogeneous population by estimating a categorical latent variable that detects relatively homogeneous subgroups within a complex phenomenon. LCA identified six different , clinically meaningful subphenotypes of septic shock<symptom> each with a typical profile: ( 1) `` Uncomplicated Septic Shock<symptom> , ( 2) `` Pneumonia<disease> with adult respiratory distress syndrome<disease><symptom> ( ARDS) '' , ( 3) `` Postoperative Abdominal<disease> '' , ( 4) `` Severe Septic Shock<symptom> '' , ( 5): `` Pneumonia<disease> with ARDS and multiple<symptom> organ dysfunction syndrome<disease><symptom> ( MODS) '' , ( 6) `` Late Septic Shock<symptom> ''. The 6-class solution showed high entropy approaching 1 ( i.e. , 0.92) , indicating there was excellent separation between estimated classes. LCA appears to be an applicable statistical tool in analysing a heterogenous clinical cohort of septic shock<symptom>. The results may lead to a better understanding of septic shock<symptom> complexity and form a basis for considering targeted therapies and selecting patients for future clinical trials.
