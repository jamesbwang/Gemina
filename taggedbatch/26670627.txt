 This study investigated the effect of supplemental iron intake ( SII) in early singleton pregnancy women with the risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM) among Chinese population.This study included 259 singleton pregnancy participants. Of those , 135 women underwent SII and were assigned to an intervention group , while 124 participants received no SII and were assigned to a control group. The outcome measurements consisted of the number of patients with GDM development , the levels of hemoglobin ( Hb) and ferritin , and the outcomes of infant at delivery.No significant difference in the number of patients with GDM development was found between 2 groups at delivery. However , when compared with control group , subjects in the intervention group showed greater efficacy in delivery mode choice of vaginal delivery ( P = .04) , and cesarean section ( P = .01) , as well as the birthweight of infants ( P < .01). Moreover , Hb and ferritin levels were also significantly higher in the intervention group than those in the control group ( P < .01). The results of this retrospective study showed that SII may not increase risk of developing GDM in singleton pregnancy women; and also may benefit both pregnancy women and infants among Chinese population.
