 The last few years have witnessed an unprecedented increase in the number of novel bacterial species that hold potential to be used for metabolic engineering. Historically , however , only a handful of bacteria have attained the acceptance and widespread use that are needed to fulfil the needs of industrial bioproduction- and only for the synthesis of very few , structurally simple compounds. One of the reasons for this unfortunate circumstance has been the dearth of tools for targeted genome engineering of bacterial chassis , and , nowadays , synthetic biology is significantly helping to bridge such knowledge gap. Against this background , in this review , we discuss the state of the art in the rational design and construction of robust bacterial chassis for metabolic engineering , presenting key examples of bacterial species that have secured a place in industrial bioproduction. The emergence of novel bacterial chassis is also considered at the light of the unique properties of their physiology and metabolism , and the practical applications in which they are expected to outperform other microbial platforms. Emerging opportunities , essential strategies to enable successful development of industrial phenotypes , and major challenges in the field of bacterial chassis development are also discussed , outlining the solutions that contemporary synthetic biology-guided metabolic engineering offers to tackle these issues.
