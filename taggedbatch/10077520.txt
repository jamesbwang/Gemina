 Whereas statistical association of hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection with cardiomyopathy is long known , establishment of a causal relationship has not been achieved so far. Patients with advanced heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) are mostly unable to tolerate interferon ( IFN)- based treatment , resulting in limited experience regarding the possible pathogenic role of HCV<pathogen> in this patient group. HCV<pathogen> infection often triggers disease in a broad spectrum of extrahepatic organs , with innate immune and autoimmune pathogenic processes involved. The fact that worldwide more than 70 million patients are chronically infected with HCV<pathogen> illustrates the possible clinical impact arising if cardiomyopathies were induced or aggravated by HCV<pathogen> , resulting in progressive HF or severe arrhythmias. A novel path has been opened to finally resolve the long-standing question of cause-effect relationship between HCV<pathogen> infection and cardiac dysfunction , by the recent development of IFN-free , highly efficient , and well tolerable anti-HCV regimens. The new direct-acting antiviral ( DAA) agents are highly virus-specific and lack unspecific side-effects upon cardiac function which have always confounded the interpretation of IFN treatment data. The actual frequency of unexplained HF in chronic HCV<pathogen> infection will be determined from a planned large-scale study. Whereas such patients probably constitute a rather small fraction of all those harboring HCV<pathogen> , they have major clinical relevance. It is not yet known which fraction of these patients will significantly benefit from HCV<pathogen> eradication , but this issue will be addressed now in a prospective study.
