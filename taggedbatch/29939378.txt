 The percentage of nurses with a baccalaureate degree in nursing ( BSN) affects patient morbidity and mortality , so health care organizations are encouraging staff nurses to finish their BSN degree. However , there is little data related to what it is like for RNs to return to school. In this qualitative , descriptive study , 16 RN-to-BSN students were interviewed using naturalistic inquiry processes to gain an understanding of what it is like for students in the midst of an RN-to-BSN program. Students encountered financial and work-life barriers to seeking BSN completion yet found it to be worth the effort. Indeed , they are `` surprised at the change in '' themselves. Support that could benefit RN-to-BSN students is detailed , including from employers ( e.g. , flexible scheduling) , faculty ( e.g. , rapid feedback and grading) , and students themselves ( e.g. , understand personal time constraints). More research is needed to determine the priorities of support that facilitates RN-to-BSN students. J Contin Educ Nurs. 2018; 49 ( 7): 307-314.
