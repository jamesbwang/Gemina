 Shock<symptom> is one of the most challenging life-threatening conditions with high mortality and morbidity; the outcomes are highly dependent on the early detection and management of the condition. Septic shock<symptom> is the most common type of shock<symptom> in the Intensive Care Unit. While not as common as other subsets of shock<symptom> , obstructive shock<symptom> is a significant subtype due to well defined mechanical and pathological causes , including tension pneumothorax , massive pulmonary embolism , and cardiac tamponade. We are presenting a patient with obstructive shock<symptom> due to inferior vena cava obstruction secondary to extensive deep venous thrombosis. Chance of survival from obstructive shock<symptom> in our patient was small; however , there was complete and immediate recovery after treatment of the obstruction on recognizing the affected vessels. This case alerts the practicing intensivist and the emergency medicine physician to consider occlusion of the great vessels other than the pulmonary artery or aorta as causes of obstructive shock<symptom>.
