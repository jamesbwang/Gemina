 Annual global deaths from cryptococcal meningitis<disease><symptom> ( CM) are estimated at 180 000 and mortality is as high as 30 % , even with optimal therapy. VT-1598 is a novel fungal CYP51 inhibitor with potent intrinsic antifungal activity against Cryptococcus<pathogen>. We report here VT-1598 's in vivo antifungal activity in a murine model of CM. Single-dose plasma and brain pharmacokinetics in mice and MIC for Cryptococcus<pathogen> neoformans<pathogen> H99 were determined prior to efficacy studies. Short-course monotherapy and combination doses were explored with the endpoint of brain fungal burden. A survival study was also conducted using monotherapy treatment with fungal burden measured after a 6 day drug washout. Oral doses of VT-1598 had good plasma and brain exposure and resulted in significant ( P < 0.0001) and dose-dependent reductions in brain fungal burden , reaching a 6 log10 reduction. Unlike either positive drug control ( fluconazole or liposomal amphotericin B) , both mid and high doses of VT-1598 reduced fungal burden to below levels measured at the start of treatment. When VT-1598 was dosed in the survival study , no VT-1598-treated animal succumbed to the infection. Whereas fluconazole showed a 2.5 log10 increase in fungal burden after the 6 day washout , the VT-1598 mid- and high-dose animals showed almost no regrowth ( < 0.5 log10). In a separate fungal burden study using suboptimal doses of VT-1598 and liposomal amphotericin B to probe for combination effects , each combination had a positive effect relative to corresponding monotherapies. These pre-clinical in vivo data strongly support clinical investigation of VT-1598 as a novel therapy for this lethal infection.
