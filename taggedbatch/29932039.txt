 The Cellular immunity plays an important role in amoebic infections , whereas humoral immune responses have little influence on the outcome of the disease. Chronic infestation with E. histolytica<pathogen> , a common protozoan parasite , has been associated with autoimmune phenomena , including the appearance of antibodies to colonic epithelial cells. The mechanism whereby the protozoan parasite E. histolytica<pathogen> causes suppression of the immune response to allow it to survive in humans is unclear. Both parasite and parasite induced host factors appear to be important in immunoregulation. This study was designed to evaluate prolonged antibody response to E. histolytica<pathogen> ( HM1: IMSS) which may contribute and might identify antigens implicated in the disease pathology and throw light on the massive T-cell infiltration causing inflammation<symptom>. An in vivo study was undertaken against experimentally induced animal model by evaluating total protein , Radial Immunodiffusion and Antiamoebic IgG antibody detection by ELISA using serum samples from rabbit collected weekly from day 7-28th ( RS1: day-7; RS2: day-14 , RS3: day-21 and RS4: day-28) which were immunized with amoebic antigen. Serological and cytokines profile- like interleukin-6 ( IL-6) , IL-10 and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) were also analyzed. Our result indicated that RS4 showed a significant 167.3 ± 0.333 mg/dl value for IgG antibodies whereas , RS3 showed significant elevated 0.57 ± 0.033 mg/dL C ' reactive protein and 7.6667 ± 0.333 IU/mL Rheumatoid factor level. Similarly RS3 775.00 ± 0.57 pg/ml showed maximum significant values for TNF-α , whereas IL-6 level was higher in RS4 701.00 ± 0.577 pg/ml but IL-10 level was found low in RS1 62.33 ± 0.33 pg/ml respectively. Thus our study demonstrated the efficacy of amoebic antigen in immune response mechanism and how they provoked inflammation<symptom> and act as immunomodulator. This article also summarized some relevant patents with respect to E. histolytica<pathogen> against inflammation<symptom> and other diseases.
