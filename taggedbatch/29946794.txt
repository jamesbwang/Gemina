 The number of persons who have successfully completed treatment for a cancer diagnosed during childhood and who have entered adulthood is increasing over time , and former patients will become aging citizens. Ten years ago , an expert panel met in Erice , Italy , to produce a set of principles concerning the cure and care of survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer. The result was the Erice Statement ( Haupt et al.. Eur J Cancer 43 ( 12): 1778-80 , 2007) that was translated into nine languages. Ten years on , it was timely to review , and possibly revise , the Erice Statement in view of the changes in paediatric oncology and the number and results of international follow-up studies conducted during the intervening years. The long-term goal of the cure and care of a child with cancer is that he/she becomes a resilient and autonomous adult with optimal health-related quality of life , accepted in society at the same level as his/her age peers. `` Cure '' refers to cure from the original cancer , regardless of any potential for , or presence of , remaining disabilities or side effects of treatment. The care of a child with cancer should include complete and honest information for parents and the child. Some members of the previous expert panel , as well as new invited experts , met again in Erice to review the Erice Statement , producing a revised version including update and integration of each of the ten points. In addition , a declaration has been prepared , by the Childhood Cancer International Survivors Network in Dublin on October 2016 ( see Annex 1).
