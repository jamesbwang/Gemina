 Splenic stroma overlaid with hematopoietic progenitors supports in vitro hematopoiesis with production of dendritic-like cells. Co-cultures of murine lineage-depleted bone<disease> marrow over the 5G3 stromal line produce two populations of cells , characterised as CD11b Here we show both the L-DC and cDC-like subsets can be activated and induce proliferation of OT-I CD8 Co-cultures of hematopoietic progenitors over splenic stroma produce two distinct subsets of dendritic-like cells. These are here distinguished phenotypically and through gene expression differences. While both resemble DC , there are functionally distinct. L-DC activate CD8
