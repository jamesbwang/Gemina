 Sphingosine kinase 1 ( SphK1) is a master kinase that catalyzes the synthesis of sphingosine 1 phosphate and participates in the regulation of cell proliferation and autophagy. The present study aimed to assess the effects of the activation of the SphK1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK)/ phosphorylated ( p-) ERK pathway in the regulation of autophagy in colon cancer ( HT-29) cells. Inverted fluorescence microscopy was used to detect the expression of green fluorescent protein ( GFP) in the SphK1-overexpressing HT-29 cells ( SphK1 ( +)- HT-29) and the negative control HT-29 cells ( NC-HT-29). Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of SphK1 , ERK1/2 , p-ERK1/ 2 , as well as those of the autophagy-associated markers LC3A , ATG5 , and ULK1. Protein localization and expression of the LC3A antibody were detected by immunofluorescence. The results demonstrated that GFP was similarly expressed in SphK1 ( +)- HT-29 and NC-HT-29 cells. However , significantly increased SphK1 mRNA and protein expression levels were detected in SphK1 ( +)- HT-29 cells compared with in NC-HT-29 cells , which resulted in upregulated ERK/p-ERK. Furthermore , the protein expression levels of the three autophagy-associated markers increased. LC3A protein was localized in the cytoplasm of SphK1 ( +)- HT-29 cells , indicating autophagy. In summary , the findings of the present study suggested that activation of the SphK1/ERK/p-ERK pathway promotes autophagy in colon cancer HT-29 cells.
