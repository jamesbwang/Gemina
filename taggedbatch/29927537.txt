 The second ACPGBI Ileoanal Pouch Registry ( IPR) report was released in July 2017 following a first report in 2012. This article provides a summary of data derived from the most recent IPR report ( 1). The IPR is an electronic database of voluntarily submitted data including patient demographics , disease , intra and post-operative factors submitted by consultant surgeons or delegates. Data up to 31 5,352 pouch operations were carried out at 76 UK and four European centres by 154 surgeons over four decades. Recorded procedures have increased over time but data submission is voluntary and underestimates actual volume. Significant variation exists in institutional volume; 73 centres entered data on patients undergoing pouch surgery during the past five years. Of these , 44 centres have submitted â‰¤ 10 cases , with 10 centres submitting one patient and nine centres two cases. Since 2013 minimal access surgery has been employed in 54 % of cases. Rectal dissection was undertaken in the total mesorectal excision ( TME) plane in 69 %. J-pouch configuration was used in 99 % of cases and 90 % of pouch-anal anastomoses were performed using a stapled technique. Including all years the IPR rate of pelvic<disease> sepsis<disease> was 9.4 % and the rate of pouch failure 4.7 %. The IPR holds the largest voluntary repository of data on ileoanal pouch surgery. The second report from the IPR records marked refinements in surgical technique over time but also highlights wide variation in institutional caseload and outcome across the United Kingdom.
