 Social science concepts of well-being are largely premised on notions of a common humanity with shared physical needs and broadly legible experiences of the world. While medical anthropologists have interrogated ideas of universal bodily subjectivities , articulations of well-being across species boundaries remain underexplored. This article offers a conceptualization of well-being that attends to species difference. Drawing on ethnographic research with an animal rescue organization , I argue that in the context of partially connected bodily experiences , rescue workers navigate distinctions between dogs ' internal feelings and external actions , and they train their bodies alongside dogs ' bodies to cultivate canine well-being. A multispecies perspective complicates ideals of autonomy and self-actualization long associated with well-being and opens up avenues for considering well-being as an intercorporeal relationship conditioned in unequal bodies and embodied interactions.
