 The immunosuppressive microenvironment plays a crucial role in T-cell immunodeficiency in multiple myeloma ( MM). Overexpression of T-cell immunosuppressive receptors , including programmed death-1 ( PD-1) and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain-containing-3 ( Tim-3) , may be related to tumor immunosuppression and poor prognosis , and the malignant bone<disease> marrow ( BM) microenvironment may contribute to such immunosuppression. The purpose of this study was to analyze the distribution of PD-1 The expression of PD-1 and Tim-3 with exhausted ( CD244 A significant increase in both PD-1 We characterized the distribution of PD-1 and TIM-3 concurrent with exhausted CD3
