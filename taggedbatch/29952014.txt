 The pannexin 1 ( Panx1) channel is a mechanosensitive channel that interacts with P2X7 receptors ( P2X7R) to form a functional complex that has been shown in vitro to play an essential role in osteocyte mechanosignaling. While the participation of P2X7R in skeletal responses to mechanical loading has been demonstrated , the role of Panx1 and its interplay with P2X7R still remain to be determined. In this study , we use a global Panx1
