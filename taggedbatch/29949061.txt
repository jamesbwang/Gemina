 The initial stages of protein unfolding may reflect the stability of the entire fold and can also reveal which parts of a protein can be perturbed , without restructuring the rest. In this work , we couple UVPD with activated ion mobility mass spectrometry to measure how three model proteins start to unfold. Ubiquitin , cytochrome c and myoglobin ions produced via nESI from salty solutions are subjected to UV irradiation pre-mobility separation; experiments are conducted with a range of source conditions which alter the conformation of the precursor ion as shown by the drift time profiles. For all three proteins , the compact structures result in less fragmentation than more extended structures which emerge following progressive in-source activation. Cleavage sites are found to differ between conformational ensembles , for example , for the dominant charge state of cytochrome c ( M + 7H)
