 Rhinophyma is the final stage in the evolution of acne rosacea , a common vasoactive dermatosis. Individuals with rhinophyma present with a typical , disfiguring nasal appearance consisting of bulbous enlargement , erythema , and telangiectasia with a sebaceous , oily skin surface. This classic appearance permits a facile diagnosis but may also lead the physician to overlook a coexistent malignancy. We report the occurrence of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL) arising synchronously with a marked rhinophyma. A wide local excision of the malignancy was performed , and the defect was reconstructed with forehead flaps. The rhinophyma was treated with a skin graft and cheek flaps. Following surgery , chemotherapy was used to manage the systemic<disease> disease<disease>. This case demonstrates the necessity for clinical scrutiny in the diagnosis and treatment of rhinophyma. It is imperative to entertain a high degree of suspicion when non-typical changes are observed within a rhinophymatous lesion<symptom> or in adjacent areas of the nose.
