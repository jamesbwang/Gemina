 In dorsal root ganglion ( DRG) neurons , ATP is an important neurotransmitter in nociceptive signaling through P2 receptors ( P2Rs) such as P2X2/3R , and adenosine is also involved in anti-nociceptive signaling through adenosine A1R. Thus , the clearance system for adenine nucleotide/nucleoside plays a critical role in regulation of nociceptive signaling , but there is little information on it , especially ectoenzyme expression profiles in DRG. In this study , we examined expression and localization of ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases ( ENPPs) , by which ATP is metabolized to AMP , in rat DRG. The mRNA expression levels of ENPP2 were greater than those of ENPP1 and ENPP3 in rat DRGs. On immunohistochemical analysis , ENPP1 , 2 and 3 were found in soma of DRG neurons. Immunopositive rate of ENPP3 was greater than that of ENPP1 and ENPP2 in all DRG neurons. ENPP3 , as compared with ENPP1 and ENPP2 , was expressed mainly by isolectin B4-positive cells , and slightly by neurofilament 200-positive ones. In this way , the expression profile of ENPP1 , 2 and 3 was different in DRGs , and they were mainly expressed in small/medium-sized DRG neurons. Moreover , ENPP1- , 2- and 3-immunoreactivities were colocalized with P2X2R , P2X3R and prostatic acid phosphatase ( PAP) , as an ectoenzyme for metabolism from AMP to adenosine. Additionally , PAP-immunoreactivity was colocalized with equilibrative nucleoside transporter ( ENT) 1 , as an adenosine uptake system. These results suggest that the clearance system consisted of ENPPs , PAP and ENT1 plays an important role in regulation of nociceptive signaling in sensory neurons.
