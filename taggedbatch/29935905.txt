 Surgical drains are widely used despite limited evidence in their favor. This study describes the associations between drains and surgical<disease> site<disease> infections<disease> ( SSI). This prospective observational double center study was performed in Switzerland between February 2013 and August 2015. The odds of SSI in the presence of drains were increased in general ( OR 2.41 , 95 % CI 1.32-4.30 , p = 0.004) , but less in vascular and not in orthopedic trauma surgery. In addition to the surgical division , the association between drains and SSI depended significantly on the duration of surgery ( p = 0.01) and wound<disease><symptom> class ( p = 0.034). Furthermore , the duration of drainage ( OR 1.24 , 95 % CI 1.15-1.35 , p < 0.001) , the number ( OR 1.74 , 95 % CI 1.09-2.74 , p = 0.019) and type of drains ( open versus closed: OR 3.68 , 95 % CI 1.88 , 6.89 , p < 0.001) as well as their location ( overall p = 0.002) were significantly associated with SSI. The general use of drains is discouraged. However , drains may be beneficial in specific surgical procedures.
