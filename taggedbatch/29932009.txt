 The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic radiographic findings of femoroacetabular impingement ( FAI) in paediatric football players in different age groups and to investigate aetiological factors. Paediatric male athletes between 10 and 17 years of age from 8 soccer teams were recruited. In addition to an annual control check-up , anteroposterior pelvis and frog-leg radiographs as well as the curriculum vitae of the athletes , their injuries , and real-time complaints were recorded. The alpha angle , lateral centre-edge angle , Tönnis angle , and collodiaphyseal angle were measured and morphological abnormalities were noted. There were 214 male football players with a mean age of 13.4 ± 3.2 years included in the study. In the morphological analysis of hips , there was FAI in 30 % of the athletes. In the analysis of FAI prevalence in 3 subgroups based on age ( Group 1: 10-12 years ( n = 25) , Group 2: 13-15 years ( n = 104) , Group 3: 16-17 years ( n = 85)) , there was 0 % FAI in Group 1 , 19.1 % in Group 2 and 60 % in Group 3. In the analysis of aetiological factors , there was no significant difference between the right and left hips of players regarding alpha angles and FAI prevalence. However , the prevalence of FAI was higher in players who had been playing football for 3 years or more and who had been training for 12.5 hours/week or more. Training for 12.5 hours or more per week in paediatric football players doubled the risk development of FAI morphology.
