 When gene duplication occurs , one of the copies may become free of selective pressure and evolve at an accelerated pace. This has important consequences on the prediction of orthology relationships , since two orthologous genes separated by divergence after duplication may differ in both sequence and function. In this work , we make the distinction between the primary orthologs , which have not been affected by accelerated mutation rates on their evolutionary path , and the secondary orthologs , which have. Similarity-based prediction methods will tend to miss secondary orthologs , whereas phylogeny-based methods can not separate primary and secondary orthologs. However , both types of orthology have applications in important areas such as gene function prediction and phylogenetic reconstruction , motivating the need for methods that can distinguish the two types. We formalize the notion of divergence after duplication and provide a theoretical basis for the inference of primary and secondary orthologs. We then put these ideas to practice with the Hybrid Prediction of Paralogs and Orthologs ( HyPPO) framework , which combines ideas from both similarity and phylogeny approaches. We apply our method to simulated and empirical datasets and show that we achieve superior accuracy in predicting primary orthologs , secondary orthologs and paralogs. HyPPO is a modular framework with a core developed in Python and is provided with a variety of C++ modules. The source code is available at https://github.com/manuellafond/HyPPO.
