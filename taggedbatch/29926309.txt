 Tumor tissue is composed of tumor cells and surrounding non-tumor endothelial and immune cells , collectively known as the tumor microenvironment. Tumor cells manipulate tumor microenvironment to obtain sufficient oxygen and nutrient supply , and evade anti-tumor immunosurveillance. Various types of signaling molecules , including cytokines , chemokines , growth factors , and lipid mediators , are secreted , which co-operate to make up the complex tumor microenvironment. Prostaglandins , cyclooxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid , are abundantly produced in tumor tissues. Ever since treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed anti-tumor effect in mouse models and human patients by inhibiting whole prostaglandin production , investigators have focused on the importance of prostaglandins in tumor malignancies. However , most studies that followed focused on the role of an eminent prostaglandin , prostaglandin E
