 Recent investigations have shown that deep eutectic solvents provide a suitable environment for self-organisation of biomolecules , in particular phospholipids and proteins. However , the solvation of complex lyophilic moieties by deep eutectic solvents still remains unclear. Here we explore the behaviour of zwitterionic surfactants in choline chloride: glycerol eutectic mixture. Dodecyl-2- ( trimethylammonio) ethylphosphate and N-alkyl-N , N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate ( alkyl = dodecyl , tetradecyl) surfactants were investigated by means of surface tension , X-ray reflectivity and small-angle neutron scattering. These surfactants were found to remain surface active and form globular micelles in deep eutectic solvents. Still , the surface behaviour of these species was found to differ depending on the headgroup and tail structure. The morphology of the micelles also slightly varies between surfactants , demonstrating differences in the packing of individual monomers. The characteristics of mixtures of the dodecyl surfactants is also reported , showing a deviation from ideal mixing associated with attractive interactions between sulfobetaine and phosphocholine headgroups. Such non-ideality results in variation of the surface behaviour and self-assembly of these surfactant mixtures. The results presented here will potentially lead to the development of new alternatives for drug-delivery , protein solubilisation and biosensing through a better fundamental understanding of the behaviour of zwitterionic surfactants in deep eutectic solvents.
