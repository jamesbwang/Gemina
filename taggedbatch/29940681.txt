 Multilevel upper airway surgery for obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) has been shown to cause clinically significant dysphagia<symptom> in some patients. We describe the cases of 2 adults with OSA who developed persistent dysphagia<symptom> after multilevel upper airway surgery. Patient-specific computational analysis of swallowing mechanics ( CASM) revealed absent pharyngeal<symptom> shortening and aberrant tongue base retraction in both patients. These findings are consistent with the OSA surgical goal of enlarging the hypopharyngeal airway but likely contributed to our patients ' dysphagia<symptom>. Patient-specific CASM allows for sensitive identification of swallowing mechanical dysfunction that might otherwise be overlooked , and it may be utilized in future head and neck surgery patients to analyze swallowing dysfunction associated with treatment.
