 The risk factors for acute<symptom> pain<symptom> as well as chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> syndrome<disease><symptom> ( CPS) in spine surgery have not been defined to date. To define the prognostic parameters of acute<symptom> pain<symptom> severity and the risk of CPS in patients operated on for spinal diseases and injuries. The study included 291 patients operated on for degenerative diseases and injuries of the spine at the Sklifosovsky Research Institute of Emergency Medicine in 2010-2016. Sociodemographic and clinical data and the psychological status of patients were evaluated. A mechanical algometer was used to measure the pain threshold ( PT) and pain tolerance. The movement pain<symptom> intensity was assessed by using a visual analog scale ( VAS) on the day of surgery. Pain was considered minor at a median score of 0-4 cm and severe at a median score of 5-10 cm. The presence of CPS was assessed during a telephone survey 5-7 months after surgery. The gender , PT , dynamic pain intensity before surgery , and expectation of postoperative pain are risk factors for severe<pathogen><disease><symptom> acute postoperative pain. A multinomial logit regression model ( Hosmer-Lemeshow test- 4.322; p = 0.827) predicts minor dynamic pain on the 1 The developed software in the form of MS Excel calculators provides a particular patient with preoperative assessment of the risk for minor acute dynamic pain on the 1
