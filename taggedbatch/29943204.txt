 To estimate and compare the management of diabetes among Arab , Asian , non-Hispanic Black , and non-Hispanic Whites attending a large health system in metropolitan Detroit. Data were electronically abstracted for 6622 adult patients with diabetes. Dependent variables were uptake of A1c testing and results , LDL-C testing and results , and eye examination frequency. The independent variable was race/ethnicity. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between Arab Americans and non-Hispanic Whites for each of the dependent variables while controlling for confounders. Arab Americans were 38 % more likely than non-Hispanic Whites to report an A1c > 7 % ( OR 1.38; 95 % CI 1.03 , 1.87). Arab Americans were 62 % less likely to receive an eye exam compared to non-Hispanic Whites ( OR 1.62; 95 % CI 1.21 , 2.17). Population based studies about diabetes management among Arab Americans will facilitate tailored interventions aimed at preventing/delaying diabetes complications and reducing premature mortality due to diabetes.
