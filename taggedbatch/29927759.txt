 Surgical adhesive agents are frequently applied to reinforce aortic sutures in cardiac and aortic surgery. They are thought to provide hemostasis and safely and effectively reduce morbidity. Complications owing to surgical glue remnants , however , have been reported. In our recent case , a surgical glue remnant was detected on the aortic valve by transesophageal echocardiography. For detection of such surgical glue remnants , and to prevent associated serious potential complications , comprehensive transesophageal echocardiography is important. If surgical glue is applied during operative procedures , the heart and aorta should be carefully examined by transesophageal echocardiography.
