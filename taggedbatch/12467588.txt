 Clustered protocadherins ( Pcdhs) are neuronal cell adhesion molecules characterized by homophilic adhesion between the tetramers of 58 distinct isoforms in mice. The diversity of Pcdhs and resulting highly-specific neuronal adhesion may be required for the formation of neural circuits for executing higher brain functions. However , this hypothesis remains to be tested , because knockout of Pcdh genes produces abnormalities that may interfere with higher brain functions indirectly. In Pcdh-α1 ,12 mice , only α1 , α12 and two constitutive isoforms are expressed out of 14 isoforms. The appearance and behavior of Pcdh-α1 ,12 mice are similar to those of wild-type mice , and most abnormalities reported in Pcdh-α knockout mice are not present in Pcdh-α1 ,12 mice. We examined Pcdh-α1 ,12 mice in detail , and found that cortical depression<symptom> induced by sensory mismatches between vision and whisker sensation in the visual cortex was impaired. Since Pcdh-α is densely distributed over the cerebral cortex , various types of higher function are likely impaired in Pcdh-α1 ,12 mice. As expected , visual short-term memory of space/shape was impaired in behavioral experiments using space/shape cues. Furthermore , behavioral learning based on audio-visual associative memory was also impaired. These results indicate that the molecular diversity of Pcdh-α plays essential roles for sensory integration and short-term memory.
