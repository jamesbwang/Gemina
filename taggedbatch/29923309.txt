 Measurement of the urine catecholamine metabolites homovanillic acid ( HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid ( VMA) are the standard method for detecting disease recurrence in neuroblastoma. We present a case of abnormal concentrations of catecholamine metabolites that prompted investigations for relapsed neuroblastoma. However , further study revealed that the abnormal biochemistry was likely due to ingestion of olives. Olive ingestion should be considered when interpreting urine HVA and VMA results , and excluded if concentrations are unexpectedly abnormal.
