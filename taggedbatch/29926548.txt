 Idiopathic pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> involves irreversible alveolar destruction. Although alveolar epithelial type II cells are key functional participants within the lung parenchyma , how epithelial cells are affected upon bleomycin ( BLM) exposure remains unknown. In this study , we determined whether BLM could induce cell cycle arrest via regulation of Schlafen ( SLFN) family genes , a group of cell cycle regulators known to mediate growth-inhibitory responses and apoptosis in alveolar epithelial type II cells. Mouse AE II cell line MLE-12 were exposed to 1-10 μg/mL BLM and 0.01-100 μM baicalein ( Bai) , a G1/G2 cell cycle inhibitor , for 24 hours. Cell viability and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed by MTT and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , respectively. Apoptosis-related gene expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR). Cellular morphology was determined after DAPI and Hoechst 33258 staining. To verify cell cycle arrest , propidium iodide ( PI) staining was performed for MLE-12 after exposure to BLM. BLM decreased the proliferation of MLE-12 cells. However , it significantly increased expression levels of interleukin 6 , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α , and transforming growth factor β1. Based on Hoechst 33258 staining , BLM induced condensation of nuclear and fragmentation. Based on DAPI and PI staining , BLM significantly increased the size of nuclei and induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Results of qRT-PCR analysis revealed that BLM increased mRNA levels of BAX but decreased those of Bcl2. In addition , BLM/Bai increased mRNA levels of p53 , p21 , SLFN1 , 2 , 4 of Schlafen family. BLM exposure affects pulmonary epithelial type II cells , resulting in decreased proliferation possibly through apoptotic and cell cycle arrest associated signaling.
