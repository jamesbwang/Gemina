 To describe total fluid intake ( TFI) and types of fluid consumed in urban China by age , gender , regions and city socioeconomic status relative to the adequate intakes ( AI) set by the Chinese Nutrition Society. In 2016 , participants aged 4-9 , 10-17 and 18-55 years were recruited via a door-to-door approach in 27 cities in China. In total , 2233 participants were included. The volumes and sources of TFI were collected using the Liq.In The mean daily TFI among children , adolescents and adults were 966 , 1177 and 1387 mL , respectively. In each age group , TFI was significantly higher in male vs female ( 981 vs 949 , 1240 vs 1113 , 1442 vs 1332; mL). Approximately 45 , 36 and 28 % of children , adolescents and adults reached the AI. Although plain water was the highest contributor to TFI , the contribution of sugar sweetened beverages ( SSB) was ranked in the top three together with water and milk and derivatives. Approximately 27 , 48 and 47 % of children , adolescents and adults consumed more than one serving of SSB per day , respectively. A relatively large proportion of participants did not drink enough to meet the AI in urban China. Many children , adolescents and adults consumed more than one serving of SSB per day. A majority of children , adolescents and adults in the study population do not meet both quantitative and qualitative fluid intake requirements , and signal socioeconomic disparities.
