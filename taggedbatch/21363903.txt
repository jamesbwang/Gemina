 Recently the United States Assistant Secretary of Mental Health and Substance Use disclosed having suspended the National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices , stating it was so deficient in both rigor and breadth that it must be replaced. However , a closer examination of her claims about the Registry indicates many of them to be inaccurate. Contrary to her assertions , the Registry is not devoid of medication-assisted treatments for opioid use; nor does it contain but a scant few interventions related to schizophrenia and psychosis. Moreover , many of her criticisms regarding rigor pertain to reviews completed since late 2015 , when the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration altered key aspects of the Registry. In contrast to reviews generated under the 2007 rules , these newer reviews rely on fewer references , incorporate less expert input , are more likely to be based exclusively on gray literature , and are no longer required either to provide dissemination readiness information or meet certain minimum research quality standards. However , only 123 ( 25.7 %) of the 479 Registry interventions have been reviewed solely using the problematic 2015 criteria , with the remaining 356 interventions having a review which use the 2007 guidelines. Yet , rather than address the agency 's recent missteps and expand the Registry 's content coverage , the agency appears to have decided to invest considerable resources into replacing it , relying heavily on expert consensus versus empirical data in its initial attempt to do so. This raises questions about the agency 's current commitment to evidence-based practice.
