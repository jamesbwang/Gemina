 The goat ( Using a highly sensitive method of S-poly ( T) plus for miRNAs detection , we analyze the expression patterns of 715 miRNAs in goat mammary gland tissues at different stages of lactation. We observed that miR-25 expression had an inverse relationship with milk<symptom> production<symptom>. Overexpression of miR-25 significantly repressed triacylglycerol synthesis and lipid droplet accumulation. To explore the regulatory mechanism of miR-25 in milk lipid metabolism , we analyzed its putative target genes with bioinformatics analysis followed by 3 '- UTR assays. Peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 beta ( Taken together , our results show miR-25 is potentially involved in lipid metabolism and we reveal the function of the miR-25/
