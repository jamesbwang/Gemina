 Expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> often requires use of inducible promoters to shorten the lag phase and improve protein productivity and final protein titer. Synthetic molecules that can not be metabolized by E.<pathogen> coli , such as isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG) , have been frequently used to trigger the protein expression during early exponential growth phase. This practice has many drawbacks , including high cost and toxicity of IPTG , complex operating procedure , and non-uniform protein expression pattern ( some cells in the population do not express recombinant proteins). A few auto-inducible protein expression systems have been developed recently to overcome some of these limitations , but they required use of an additional plasmid or presence of large ( a few kilobases) DNA part to be functional , making plasmid construction to be difficult , especially when multiple genes need to be expressed. In this study , by using RNA sequencing , we identified a short , endogenous promoter ( PthrC) that can be auto-induced during early exponential growth phase , and improved its performance by use of native and mutated regulatory elements. We found that the developed mutants of PthrC drove uniform protein expression-close to 100 % of cells were fluorescent when green fluorescence protein was used as target protein-and cells carrying them could achieve much higher cell density than those with T7 promoter ( PT7) , a commonly used inducible promoter. In terms of promoter strength ( product protein quantity per cell) , the developed promoter mutants can cover a range of strength , from 30 to 150 % of maximal strength of PT7. One strong mutant ( PthrC3_8) was found to work well at a large range of temperature ( 22 , 30 , 37 Â°C) and in various media , and was also confirmed to cause less stress to host cell than PT7 when they were used to express a toxic protein. We foresee that PthrC3 and its mutants will be useful genetic parts for various applications including metabolic engineering and biocatalysis.
