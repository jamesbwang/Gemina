 Recent cohort studies have shown that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , and especially nonalcoholic steatohepatitis , associate with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease , independently of conventional cardiometabolic risk factors. However , the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiological link between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and cardiovascular disease still remain unclear. Our previous studies have identified STK25 ( serine/threonine protein kinase 25) as a critical determinant in ectopic lipid storage , meta-inflammation , and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The aim of this study was to assess whether STK25 is also one of the mediators in the complex molecular network controlling the cardiovascular disease risk. Atherosclerosis was induced in This study provides the first evidence that STK25 plays a critical role in regulation of cardiovascular disease risk and suggests that pharmacological inhibition of STK25 function may provide new possibilities for prevention/treatment of atherosclerosis.
