 Breast milk is a potential source of infant and young children lead exposure , but national-level data on breast milk lead ( BML) is unknown in China. To fill up this gap , we conducted a review by analyzing the articles enrolled through searching Wanfang MedOnline , CNKI , SinoMed , Pubmed , and Embase databases and relevant articles from 2000 through 2017. After screening and assessing process , 17 articles were included. The average concentrations of BML in these studies varied with regions ( 1.54-171.84 Î¼g/L) , and the BML level was dropping down in general. In conclusion , breast milk should still be encouraged to infant and young children in normal areas of China , and stopping breastfeeding should be considered prudently. Education for health workers and families on BML should be strengthened , and more surveys on BML should be conducted.
