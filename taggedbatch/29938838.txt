 Candida auris<pathogen> is a multidrug-resistant pathogenic yeast whose recent emergence is of increasing public-health concern. C.<pathogen> auris<pathogen> can colonise multiple body sites , including patients ' skin , and survive for weeks in the health care environment , facilitating patient-to-patient transmission and fueling health care-associated outbreaks. Rapid and accurate detection of C.<pathogen> auris<pathogen> colonisation is essential for timely implementation of infection control measures and to prevent transmission. Currently , axilla/groin composite swabs , used to assess colonisation status , are processed using a culture-based method that is sensitive and specific but requires 14 days. This delay limits the opportunity to respond and highlights the need for a faster alternative. The culture-independent T2 Magnetic Resonance ( T2MR) system is a rapid diagnostic platform shown to detect target pathogens of interest from unprocessed blood samples in < 5 hours. In this study , a new C. auris-specific T2 assay was evaluated for screening of the skin surveillance samples. Inclusivity and limit of detection of the T2 C.<pathogen> auris<pathogen> assay were assessed with spiked samples in a representative skin flora background. The T2 C.<pathogen> auris<pathogen> assay recognised isolates from each of the 4 known clades of C.<pathogen> auris<pathogen> and consistently detected cells at 5 CFU/mL. Finally , 89 clinical axilla/groin swab samples were processed with the T2 C.<pathogen> auris<pathogen> assay. The culture-based diagnostic assay was used as a gold standard to determine performance statistics including sensitivity ( 0.89) and specificity ( 0.98). Overall , the T2 C.<pathogen> auris<pathogen> assay performed well as a rapid diagnostic and could help expedite the detection of C.<pathogen> auris<pathogen> in patient skin swabs.
