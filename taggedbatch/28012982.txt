 Because the epidemiology of Clostridium<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> infection ( CDI) is region-specific , the present study was undertaken to examine the epidemiology of C difficile outbreaks in Beijing , China.Eighty nonduplicate isolates were collected from March , 2016 to December , 2016. The molecular type and phylogenetic analysis were evaluated by multilocus sequence typing ( MLST). The minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs) for 11 antibiotics and the resistance mechanisms were investigated.Sixty-five toxigenic strains ( 81.25 %) , including 22 tcdABCDT strains ( 27.5 %) and 43 tcdABCDT strains ( 53.75 %) , and also 15 nontoxigenic strains ( tcdABCDT; 18.75 %) were detected. MLST identified 21 different sequence types ( STs) , including 2 novel types ( ST409 and ST416). All isolates were susceptible to metronidazole , vancomycin , fidaxomicin , piperacillin/tazobactam , and meropenem , and all were effectively inhibited by emodin ( MICs 4-8 Î¼g/mL). The resistance rates to rifaximin , ceftriaxone , clindamycin , erythromycin , and ciprofloxacin were 8.75 % , 51.25 % , 96.25 % , 81.25 % , and 96.25 % , respectively; 81.25 % ( 65/80) of isolates were multidrug-resistant. Amino acid mutations in GyrA and/or GyrB conferred quinolone resistance. One novel amino acid substitution , F86Y in GyrA , was found in 1 CIP-intermediate strain. The erm ( B) gene played a key role in mediating macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B ( MLSB) resistance. Erm ( G) was also found in erm ( B)- negative strains that were resistant to both erythromycin and clindamycin. RpoB mutations were associated with rifampin resistance , and 2 new amino mutations were identified in 1 intermediate strain ( E573A and E603N). Regional diversity and gene heterogeneity exist in both the ST type and resistant patterns of clinical C difficile<pathogen> isolates in Northern China.
