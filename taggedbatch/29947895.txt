 Benzodiazepines ( BZD) and Z-hypnotics are frequently analyzed in forensic laboratories , and in 2012 , the designer benzodiazepines ( DBZD) emerged on the illegal drug scene. DBZD represent a particular challenge demanding new analytical methods. In this work , parallel artificial liquid membrane extraction ( PALME) is used for sample preparation of DBZD , BZD , and Z-hypnotics in whole blood prior to UHPLC-MS/MS analysis. PALME of BZD , DBZD , and Z-hypnotics was performed from whole blood samples , and the analytes were extracted across a supported liquid membrane ( SLM) and into an acceptor solution of dimethyl sulfoxide and 200 mM formic acid ( 75:25 , v/v). The method was validated according to EMA guidelines. The method was linear throughout the calibration range ( R
