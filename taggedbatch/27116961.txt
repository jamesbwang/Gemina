 Phytotoxic effects of phenolic compounds have been extensively studied , but less attention has been given to the effects of these compounds on soil microbial communities , which are crucial to the productivity of agricultural systems. Responses of cucumber rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities to syringic acid ( SA) , a phenolic compound with autotoxicity to cucumber , were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer amplicons. SA at the concentration of 0.1 Î¼mol g-1 soil changed rhizosphere bacterial and fungal community compositions , decreased bacterial community diversity but increased fungal community richness and diversity ( P < 0.05). Moreover , SA increased the relative abundances of bacterial phylum Proteobacteria and fungal classes Leotiomycetes , Pezizomycetes , Tremellomycetes and Eurotiomycetes , but decreased the relative abundances of bacterial phylum Firmicutes and fungal class Sordariomycetes ( P < 0.05). At the genus level , SA decreased the relative abundances of microbial taxa with pathogen-antagonistic and/or plant growth promoting potentials , such as Pseudomonas<pathogen> spp. ( P < 0.05). Real-time PCR validated that SA decreased cucumber rhizosphere Pseudomonas<pathogen> spp. abundance ( P < 0.05). In vitro study showed that SA ( 0.01 to 10 mM) inhibited the growth of a strain of Pseudomonas<pathogen> spp. with pathogen-antagonistic activities to cucumber pathogen Fusarium<pathogen> oxysporum<pathogen> f.sp. cucumerinum Owen ( P < 0.05). Overall , SA changed cucumber rhizosphere bacterial and fungal community compositions , which may exert negative effects on cucumber seedling growth through inhibiting plant-beneficial microorganisms.
