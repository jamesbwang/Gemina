 Social delphinids employ a vocal repertoire of clicks for echolocation and whistles for communication. Conversely , the less social and acoustically cryptic harbour porpoises ( Phocoena phocoena) only produce narrow-band high-frequency ( NBHF) clicks with properties that appear poorly suited for communication. Nevertheless , these small odontocetes likely mediate social interactions , such as mate choice and mother-calf contact , with sound<symptom>. Here , we deployed six tags ( DTAG3) on wild porpoises in Danish waters for a total of 96 hours to investigate if the patterns and use of stereotyped NBHF click trains are consistent with a communication function. We show that wild porpoises produce frequent ( up to 27 â€¢ min
