 The emergence of light-energy-utilizing metabolism is likely to be a critical milestone in prebiotic chemistry and the origin of life. However , how the primitive pigment is spontaneously generated still remains unknown. Herein , a primitive pigment model based on adaptive self-organization of amino acids ( Cystine , Cys) and metal ions ( zinc ion , Zn
