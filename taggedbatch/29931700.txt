 A novel methodology for printing 3D objects with spatially resolved mechanical and chemical properties is reported. Photochromic molecules are used to control polymerization through coherent bleaching fronts , providing large depths of cure and rapid build rates without the need for moving parts. The coupling of these photoswitches with resin mixtures containing orthogonal photo-crosslinking systems allows simultaneous and selective curing of multiple networks , providing access to 3D objects with chemically and mechanically distinct domains. The power of this approach is showcased through the one-step fabrication of bioinspired soft joints and mechanically reinforced `` brick-and-mortar '' structures.
