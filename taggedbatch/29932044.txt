 Optimization of antimicrobial treatment is a cornerstone in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Various national and international authorities and professional veterinary and farming associations have released generic guidelines on prudent antimicrobial use in animals. However , these generic guidelines need to be translated into a set of animal species- and disease-specific practice recommendations. This article focuses on prevention of antimicrobial resistance and its complex relationship with treatment efficacy , highlighting key situations where the current antimicrobial drug products , treatment recommendations , and practices may be insufficient to minimize antimicrobial selection. The authors address this topic using a multidisciplinary approach involving microbiology , pharmacology , clinical medicine , and animal husbandry. In the first part of the article , we define four key targets for implementing the concept of optimal antimicrobial treatment in veterinary practice: ( i) reduction of overall antimicrobial consumption , ( ii) improved use of diagnostic testing , ( iii) prudent use of second-line , critically important antimicrobials , and ( iv) optimization of dosage regimens. In the second part , we provided practice recommendations for achieving these four targets , with reference to specific conditions that account for most antimicrobial use in pigs ( intestinal and respiratory<disease> disease<disease>) , cattle ( respiratory<disease> disease<disease> and mastitis<symptom>) , dogs and cats ( skin , intestinal , genitourinary , and respiratory<disease> disease<disease>) , and horses ( upper respiratory<disease> disease<disease> , neonatal foal care , and surgical<disease> infections<disease>). Lastly , we present perspectives on the education and research needs for improving antimicrobial use in the future.
