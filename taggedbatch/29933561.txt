 This study examined the gender and age differences in social inequality on life satisfaction among adolescents in 41 countries. Representative samples of adolescents aged 11 ⁻ 15 years from 41 countries were surveyed using the Health Behaviour Study among School-aged Children 2013/2014 ( HBSC) questionnaire and research protocol. A Relative Index of Inequality ( RII) estimated from the Poisson regression was employed to measure the level of social inequality. Family affluence was significantly positively associated with higher adolescent life satisfaction in nearly all countries ( RII = 1.344; 95 % confidence interval: 1.330 ⁻ 1.359). The average RII values for boys and girls were almost equal ( 1.318) and did not differ significantly across 11- , 13- and 15-year-old groups ( 1.373 , 1.324 and 1.342 , respectively). However , the gender and age differences in this association were controversial across countries. An analysis of data by countries revealed that among students from Israel , Italy and Ireland ( in seven countries altogether) , social inequality in life satisfaction ( LS) was significantly greater for girls , while among students from Norway , the Republic of Moldova and the Czech Republic ( in 20 countries altogether) , social inequality in LS was significantly greater among boys; in 14 countries , the RII value did not significantly differ between boys and girls. Comparing social inequality in LS between 11- and 15-year-olds , in nine countries ( e.g. , Belgium-Flemish , Czech Republic , Netherlands) the RII was significantly greater among 15-year-olds , in 16 countries ( e.g. , Albania , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Spain) the RII was significantly greater among 11-year-olds , and in 16 countries there were no significant differences in RII values. In conclusion , social inequality in adolescent LS differs between boys and girls and between age groups , providing substantial variation in these differences across countries.
