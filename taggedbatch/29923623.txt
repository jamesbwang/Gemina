 This study evaluates the agreement between different methods to assess moderate<symptom> to vigorous physical activity ( MVPA) in a large sample of Finnish adults. Methods were classified and examined pairwise ( accelerometer vs diary; questionnaire vs interview). Proportion of participants meeting the aerobic health-enhancing physical activity ( HEPA) recommendation was compared pairwise between all four methods. The present study of 1916 adults aged 18-75 years ( mean age 50 years , 57 % women) is a sub-sample of population-based Health 2011 Study conducted by the National Institute of Health and Welfare in Finland. Participants used accelerometer for 7 days and completed physical activity ( PA) diary during the same period. PA questionnaire and interview were completed retrospectively to assess typical weekly PA over the past year. Agreement between the methods was analyzed with paired samples t-test and Bland-Altman plot. Kappa-test was used to compare the prevalence of meeting the HEPA recommendation. The accelerometer resulted in 13 minutes ( P < 0.001) higher weekly total amount of MVPA compared to diary. According to Bland-Altman plot , the 95 % limit of agreement was from +273 to -247 in weekly minutes. The comparison between questionnaire and interview showed non-significant mean difference of 3 minutes ( P = 0.60) in weekly MVPA , but the Bland-Altman plot showing the 95 % limit of agreement from +432 to -427 in weekly minutes. Agreement of meeting HEPA recommendation was moderate between questionnaire and interview ( κ = 0.43) but poor ( κ = 0.20-0.38) between other comparisons. The inter-method differences were large especially at the individual level. Thus the assessment of PA is strongly method-dependent and not interchangeable.
