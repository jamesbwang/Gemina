 Treatment with the second and third generation BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs) increases cardiovascular risk in chronic myeloid leukemia<disease> ( CML) patients. We investigated the vascular adverse effects of three generations of TKIs in a translational model for atherosclerosis , the APOE * 3Leiden. CETP mouse. Mice were treated for sixteen weeks with imatinib ( 150 mg/kg BID) , nilotinib ( 10 and 30 mg/kg QD) or ponatinib ( 3 and 10 mg/kg QD) , giving similar drug exposures as in CML-patients. Cardiovascular risk factors were analyzed longitudinally , and histopathological analysis of atherosclerosis and transcriptome analysis of the liver was performed. Imatinib and ponatinib decreased plasma cholesterol ( imatinib , -69 % ,
