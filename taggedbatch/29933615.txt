 Imaging spectrometers show great potential for environmental and biomedical sensing applications. Selfie sticks , which are tools used to take photographs or videos , have gained global popularity in recent years. Few people have connected these two objects , and few people have researched the application of imaging spectrometers to perform scientific monitoring in point-of-use scenarios. In this paper , we develop a compact imaging spectrometer ( 35 g in weight , 18 mm in diameter , and 72 mm in length) that can be equipped on a motorized selfie stick to perform remote sensing. We applied this system to perform environmental and facial remote sensing via motorized scanning. The absorption of chlorophyll and hemoglobin can be found in the reflectance spectra , indicating that our system can be used in urban greening monitoring and point-of-care testing. In addition , this compact imaging spectrometer was also easily attached to an underwater dome port and a quad-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle to perform underwater and airborne spectral detection. Our system offers a route toward mobile imaging spectrometers used in daily life.
