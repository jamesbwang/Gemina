 We prospectively assessed by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) the advantages of desferrioxamine ( DFO) with respect to the absence of chelation therapy in non transfusion-dependent thalassaemia ( NTDT) patients. We considered 18 patients non-chelated and 33 patients who received DFO alone between the two MRI scans. Iron overload was assessed by the T2 * technique. Biventricular function parameters were quantified by cine sequences. No patient treated with DFO had cardiac iron. At baseline , only one non-chelated patient showed a pathological heart T2 * value ( < 20 ms) and he recovered at the follow-up. The percentage of patients who maintained a normal heart T2 * value was 100 % in both groups. A significant increase in the right ventricular ejection fraction was detected in DFO patients ( 3.48 ± 7.22 %; P = 0.024). The changes in cardiac T2 * values and in the biventricular function were comparable between the two groups. In patients with hepatic iron at baseline ( MRI liver iron concentration ( LIC) ≥ 3 mg/g/dw) , the reduction in MRI LIC values was significant only in the DFO group (- 2.20 ± 4.84 mg/g/dw; P = 0.050). The decrease in MRI LIC was comparable between the groups. In conclusion , in NTDT patients , DFO therapy showed no advantage in terms of cardiac iron but its administration allowed an improvement in right ventricular function. Moreover , DFO reduced hepatic iron in patients with significant iron burden at baseline.
