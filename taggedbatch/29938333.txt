 The study comprises exploring the effects of saponins from Tribulus terrestris<pathogen> ( TT) in attenuating the neuropathic pain caused by vincristine ( 100 μg/ml i.p.) for 10 days ( in two 5 day cycles with 2 days pause). Mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia were assessed by Randall-Sellitto and electronic von Frey tests , respectively. Chemical- induced nociception was assessed by formalin test. Neurophysiological effect of the extract was evaluated by recording sciatic functional index ( SFI) on the test days ( 7 , 10 , 14 , and 21) and sciatic nerve conduction velocity test ( SNCV) on the last day. Inflammatory mediators ( TNF-α , IL-1β , and IL-6) in both sciatic nerve and brain and brain neurotransmitters , glutamate and aspartate , were measured to support the behavioral response. The saponins of TT-treated group were found to be effective in the behavioral experiments , implying its activity both centrally and peripherally in attenuating pain. The inflammatory mediators in both sciatic nerve and brain ( TNF-α , IL-1β , and IL-6) were found to be attenuated with TT saponin treatment in comparison to vincristine-treated group , indicating its anti-inflammatory property. The excitatory neurotransmitters , L-glutamic acid and L-aspartic acid , were also found to be attenuated with TT saponins , implying restoration of neuronal damage and synaptic activity caused by high amount of glutamate due to excess TNF-α in brain and reversing the nociceptive threshold lowered due to aspartate. Thus , TT ( S) is peripherally and centrally active in lowering the inflammatory mediators , reversing the neuronal damage and increasing the nociceptive threshold caused due to peripheral neuropathy.
