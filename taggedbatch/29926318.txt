 Spinal meningiomas are slow-growing intradural-extramedullary tumors. They are usually associated with good outcomes. However , there are few descriptions of factors predictive of impaired evolution. Our objective was to identify predictive factors of post-operative deterioration as well as outcomes at follow-up. Between 2009 and 2016 , 87 patients had surgery for spinal meningioma in our referral center. Clinical presentation , management and outcomes were reported during the post-operative period and at 3-month follow-up. Evaluation was based on post-operative neurological deterioration defined as an increase of at least one point in the McCormick score compared to the status at admission. During the study period , post-operative deterioration occurred in 17 patients ( 19.5 %). Risk factors associated with this deterioration were the absence of pre-operative neurological signs ( Relative Risk; RR = 2.38 , p = 0.04) , an anterior location of the meningioma and a grade 2 meningioma on WHO classification score ( RR = 6 , p ≤ 0.01). At 3-month follow-up , in patients who initially presented with a motor deficit , partial recovery was found in 75 % , stability in 20 % and a deterioration of their clinical status in 5 %. After a mean follow-up of 92.4 ± 51.9 months , the recurrence rate was 8 %. Spinal meningiomas are usually benign tumors whose treatment is based on complete surgical resection. Progress in surgical techniques has resulted in lower morbidity rates and improvement in post-operative recovery. In this study , we observed several factors associated with clinical deterioration. Before surgery , patients should be fully informed of these predictive factors of post-operative deterioration and their association with surgical morbidity.
