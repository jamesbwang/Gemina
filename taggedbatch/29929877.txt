 A novel included angle based weighting method is proposed for multi-linear model predictive control ( MPC) of Hammerstein systems. It makes full use of the special structure of the Hammerstein models , and thus it is intuitive and simple. Moreover , there is only one tuning parameter and the weights can be calculated offline and stored in a look-up table. Therefore , online computational load is largely reduced. Most important of all , it schedules local controllers properly and effectively. A Lab-tank system which can be modeled into a Hammerstein model is investigated. Comparisons are made among the nonlinearity inversion control method , the proposed weighting method and traditional weighting methods , e.g. , Trapezoidal and Gaussian weighting methods. Simulations confirm that the proposed weighting method is superior to traditional methods.
