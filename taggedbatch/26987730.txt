 In this study , characterization of DTHS3 satellite DNA ( satDNA) was further expanded within the class Bivalvia. Monomer variants of DTHS3 satDNA were compared in 12 bivalve species belonging to two different subclasses , Heterodonta and Pteriomorphia. This satDNA , whose age is estimated to a minimum of 516 Ma , is contributing to the concept of the dual character of satDNA sequences: their sequence preservation throughout long evolutionary periods and generation of species-specific variants of the same satDNA family.
