 The purpose of the study is to examine disparities in AET adherence and discontinuation among Texas Medicaid-insured early-stage breast cancer patients. Texas Cancer Registry Medicaid-linked database was used from 2000 to 2007 for breast cancer patients aged 20-64. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to test the association of race/ethnicity and geographic factors with AET adherence and discontinuation. Of the 1240 women with breast cancer , 60.8 % of non-Hispanic white vs 46.6 % of Black patients were adherent to AET in the first year. After adjusting for confounding , Black patients had lower odds of adherence compared to non-Hispanic white patients ( Odds ratio 0.62 , 95 % CI 0.44-0.87) , but they were not more likely to discontinue therapy during the study period. Patients from the Texas/Mexico border had higher odds of adherence compared to other regions ( OR 2.32 , 95 % CI 1.29-4.18). There are substantial racial and geographic disparities in AET adherence and discontinuation among Texas Medicaid-insured women.
