 Treatment with intraduodenal levodopa-carbidopa infusion is one of the three therapies currently available for advanced Parkinson 's disease. It optimizes the benefit of antiparkinsonian treatment by counteracting the negative effect of erratic gastric emptying on the absorption of oral levodopa. The purpose is to describe our outpatient protocol of treatment establishment. In our unit we have implemented a protocol for the treatment with intradoudenal levodopa-carbidopa infusion without admission based on the development of a multidisciplinary circuit among the Neurology Service , the Digestive Endoscopy Unit and the Home Hospitalization Unit. Over one and a half year , we treated five patients with advanced Parkinson 's disease. All of them remain on the medication and no significant side effect has taken place. The outpatient onset install of this treatment saves costs and avoids the negative impact of admission on the patient with advanced Parkinson 's disease , in the same way that favors their adaptation and tolerability to it.
