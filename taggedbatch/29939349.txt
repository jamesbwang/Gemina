 Schizophrenia is genetic in origin and associated with a fecundity disadvantage. The deficits in schizophrenia have been attributed to variation related to the human capacity for language or brain laterality. How sex influences the relative connectivity of the 2 hemispheres is a route to understanding these 2 functions. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) we searched for sex- and hemisphere-specific changes in whole-brain functional-connectivity in multi-site datasets ( altogether 672 subjects including 286 patients , all right-handed) in the first-episode schizophrenia ( illness duration â‰¤ 1 year , mostly drug naive) and in chronic stages of schizophrenia ( illness duration > 1 year) , respectively. We used meta-analyses to integrate data from different sources concerning individuals at the same illness stage. We found first-episode male patients are predominantly left-lateralized in aberrant connectivity with a focus on Broca 's area. Female patients show a lesser degree of lateralization than males , but to the right particularly in orbital frontal cortex. In the chronic stage , the focus of aberrant connectivity shifted from anterior to posterior structures with prominent involvement of the thalamus and pre- and post-central gyri bilaterally and in both sexes. While the `` deviant connectivity '' is right-sided in both the first-episode and the chronic stages in females , in males there is a shift between stages from the left to the right hemisphere. We hypothesized that the pathophysiology of schizophrenia may lie in the interaction between sex and lateralization , ie , in genetic mechanisms located on the X and Y chromosomes , intrinsic to the evolution of language.
