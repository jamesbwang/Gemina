 The aim of the study was to determine the level of antibodies against hemagglutinin of influenza<pathogen><disease> viruses in the sera of 1,050 patients stratified into 7 different age groups during the 2016/2017 epidemic season in Poland. The method consisted of using the hemagglutination inhibition test ( HAI). The findings confirmed the presence of anti-hemagglutinin antibodies against the following influenza<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> antigens: A/California/7/ 2009 ( H1N1<pathogen>) pdm09 , A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 ( H3N2<pathogen>) , and B/Brisbane/60/ 2008. The level of anti-hemagglutinin antibodies differed across the age groups investigated , with the highest values in patients aged 10-14 years. We also found that the protection factor was highest for B/Brisbane/60/ 2008 antigen. It amounted to 72.7 % in 10-14-year olds and to 69.3 % in both 15-25 and 26-44-year olds. Taking into account a dismally low percentage of vaccinated population in the 2016/2017 epidemic season in Poland , amounting to barely 3.33 % , the findings should be interpreted as representing the patients ' immune system response to influenza<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> infection.
