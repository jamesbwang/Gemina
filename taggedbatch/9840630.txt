 The suprascapular artery is normally a branch of the thyrocervical trunk of the subclavian artery. During dissection of the left upper limb of a female cadaver , aged 70 years and fixed in 10 % formalin solution , the suprascapular artery was observed aberrantly arising from the first part of the axillary artery. Later , it coursed obliquely behind the clavicle bone and brachial plexus to reach the suprascapular notch , where it was accompanied by the suprascapular nerve. Then , both suprascapular nerve and artery anomalously traversed beneath the transverse scapular ligament. It then irrigated the supraspinatus muscles and took part in the anastomosis around the scapula. On the contralateral side there was no abnormality. Variations in the origin and course of suprascapular artery are of immense value to orthopedic and vascular surgeons , angiographists , and anatomists.
