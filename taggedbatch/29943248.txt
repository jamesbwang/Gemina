 Organochlorine ( OCs) concentrations were measured in two fish species , Mullus barbatus and Diplodus annularis , collected from Izmir Gulf during 2009-2012 in order to explain the status of these contaminants in edible fish. No data is available on the levels of organochlorines in marine organism from Izmir Gulf. In both fish species from the study area , Aroclors were determined in higher concentrations than organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs). Maximum concentrations of OCPs and PCBs measured in the edible part of D. annularis were 45-165 and 530-1591 ng g
