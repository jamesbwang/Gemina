 Most gene prioritization methods model each disease or phenotype individually , but this fails to capture patterns common to several diseases or phenotypes. To overcome this limitation , we formulate the gene prioritization task as the factorization of a sparsely filled gene-phenotype matrix , where the objective is to predict the unknown matrix entries. To deliver more accurate gene-phenotype matrix completion , we extend classical Bayesian matrix factorization to work with multiple side information sources. The availability of side information allows us to make non-trivial predictions for genes for which no previous disease association is known. Our gene prioritization method can innovatively not only integrate data sources describing genes , but also data sources describing Human Phenotype Ontology terms. Experimental results on our benchmarks show that our proposed model can effectively improve accuracy over the well-established gene prioritization method , Endeavour. In particular , our proposed method offers promising results on diseases of the nervous system; diseases of the eye and adnexa; endocrine , nutritional and metabolic diseases; and congenital malformations , deformations and chromosomal abnormalities , when compared to Endeavour. The Bayesian data fusion method is implemented as a Python/C + + package: https://github.com/jaak-s/macau. It is also available as a Julia package: https://github.com/jaak-s/BayesianDataFusion.jl.
