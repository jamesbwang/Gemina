 Psoriatic arthritis<disease><symptom> ( PsA) is a chronic and seronegative inflammatory arthritis<disease><symptom> occurring in patients with psoriasis. The current knowledge about the risk of malignancy associated with psoriatic arthritis<disease><symptom> ( PsA) patients undergoing therapy is controversial. We focused on the relationship between malignancy and therapy and undertook a meta-analysis to address this issue. A systematic literature search of the PubMed , EMBASE , and Web of Science databases was performed to identify relevant studies and trials. Statistical analysis was conducted using STATA 11.2 software. Nine cohort studies were included , corresponding to a total of 43,115 PsA patients undergoing therapy. A significant positive association between therapy and increased risk for overall malignancy was found relative to the general population as the reference group ( pooled RR , 1.29; 95 % CI: 1.04-1.60). High heterogeneity was found ( I This study allowed the estimation of cancer risk in PsA patients during therapy. Large-scale longitudinal studies will be essential to draw firm conclusions regarding PsA-associated risk for treatment-induced malignancy.
