 Atherosclerosis is considered as a multifactorial disease in terms of the pathogenic mechanisms. Oxidative stress has been implicated in atherogenesis , and the putative mechanisms of its action include oxidative modification of redox-sensitive signaling factors. High mobility group box 1 ( HMGB1) is a key inflammatory mediator in atherosclerosis , but if oxidized it loses its activity. Thus , whether and how it participates in oxidative stress-induced atherosclerosis are not clear. The current study found that exogenous HMGB1 dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of multipotent vascular stem cells and their differentiation to smooth muscle cells induced by platelet-derived growth factor. But oxidative modification impaired the activity of HMGB1 to produce the effect. The stem cells were regarded as the source of smooth muscle cells in vascular remodeling and neointimal hyperplasia<disease>. Therefore , the findings suggested that HMGB1 participated in oxidative stress-induced atherosclerosis presumably by targeting multipotent vascular stem cells.
