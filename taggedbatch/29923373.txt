 To detect 715 bp sequence of 28S rRNA in sarcosaphagous flies , and to identify their common species for solving the problem of morphological identification , as well as providing technical support for postmortem interval （ PMI ） estimation. Twenty-nine common sarcosaphagous flies were collected in Luoyang and classified by morphological characteristics. The DNA was extracted from the fly 's legs by Chelex-100 method and then the fragments of 28S rRNA were amplified and sequenced. The results were compared with twenty-eight corresponding fly species of GenBank and EMBL databases. All the sequences were analyzed by MEGA7 .0 software , and sequence alignment was performed by the searching in BLAST. The nucleotide composition was analysed , and the intraspecific and interspecific genetic distance and phylogenetic tree were established. Twenty-nine sarcosaphagous flies were classified into 6 species of 5 genera , 3 families by morphological characteristics. In the obtained 715 bp sequence of 28S rRNA , the comparison result of online BLAST showed that the similarity was 100 %. Five species were well clustered by a phylogenetic tree. Between different groups , the interspecific and intraspecific differences ranged from 0.007 to 0.045 and 0 to 0.001 , respectively. The 28S rRNA target gene sequences shows a good identification capability , which can be a new genetic marker for the identification of sarcosaphagous flies.
