 Abiotic stress can influence the interactions between a pathogen and its host. In this paper , we analyzed the effects of salicylic acid ( SA) and pH on the morphological development and pathogenicity of Magnaporthe oryzae<pathogen> , the pathogen that causes rice ( Oryza sativa) blast. A strain of rice blast that overexpresses biotrophy-associated secreted protein 1 ( BAS1) and a wild-type ( WT) strain were pretreated with different levels of pH and different concentrations of SA to analyze M. oryzae colony growth , sporulation , spore germination , dry<symptom> weight of hypha , and appressorium formation. Disease incidence and the expression of defense-related genes in infected rice were analyzed after pretreatment with pH 5.00 or pH 8.00 and 200 μM SA. The results showed that both SA and pH had some influence on morphological development , including sporulation and appressorium formation of the BAS1-overexpression strain. In the 200 μM SA pretreatment , there was a lower incidence of disease and higher expression levels of the rice defense-related genes PR1a , PAL , HSP90 , and PR5 on leaves inoculated with the BAS1-overexpession strain compared with the WT strain , whereas , LOX2 appeared to be downregulated in the BAS1-overexpession strain compared with the WT. In both pH treatments , disease incidence and expression of HSP90 were higher and the expression of PR1a and PR10a and LOX2 and PAL was lower in leaves inoculated with the BAS1-overexpression strain compared with leaves inoculated with the WT strain. We conclude that SA and pH affect morphological development of the BAS1-overexpression blast strain , but that these factors have little influence on the pathogenicity of the strain , indicating that BAS1-overexpression may have enhanced the tolerance of this rice blast strain to abiotic stressors. This work suggests new molecular mechanisms that exogenous SA and pH affect the interactions between M. oryzae<pathogen> and rice.
