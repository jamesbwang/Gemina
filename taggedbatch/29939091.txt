 Different types of milling equipment- such as oscillating ball mills , freezer mills , mortar and pestle- can be used to fragment ancient bone prior to DNA extraction. However , each of these tools is associated with practical drawbacks. Here , we present the design for a stainless-steel mortar and pestle , with a removable sleeve to contain bone material. The tool is easy to clean , practical and its simplicity allows university workshops equipped with a lathe , boring tools and a milling machine to make these components at local expense. This design allows for the efficient fragmentation of ancient bone and improves sample throughput. This design is recommended as a useful , economical addition to existing laboratory equipment for the handling of ancient bone.
