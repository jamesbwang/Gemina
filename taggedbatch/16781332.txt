 Ameloblastoma is a locally invasive tumor derived from odontogenic epithelium. An uncommon variant of ameloblastoma is granular cell type , which can not distinguish from other ameloblastoma subtypes by clinical and radiographic findings alone. Only review of it 's microscopic features allows distinction from other subtypes. The purpose of this article is to present a case of granular cell ameloblastoma. This subtype should be distinguished from the other histopathologic subtypes because of it 's higher recurrence rate and more aggressive biological behavior. Radiographic and histologic findings as well as treatment are also discussed.
