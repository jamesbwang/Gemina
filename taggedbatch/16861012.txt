When depression<symptom> is comorbid with epilepsy , it leads to low employment and poor quality of life. Thus , the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated factors of depression<symptom> among people living with epilepsy in Central Ethiopia. Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2015 at Amanuel Mental Specialized and TikurAnbesa Hospitals , Addis Ababa , Ethiopia. Samples of 422 epilepsy patients were selected , and data on depression<symptom> were collected using validated questionnaire using face-to-face interview technique. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess predictors of depression<symptom>. The study indicated that the prevalence of depression<symptom> among people with epilepsy was 43.8 %. Factors associated with depression<symptom> were being female ( AOR 2.48; 95 % CI , 1.61.3.81) , being single ( AOR 2.23; 95 % CI 1.38-3.60) , perceived stigma ( AOR 2.47; 95 % CI 1.59-3.83) , medication adherence ( AOR 2.85; 95 % CI 1.64-4.96) , and current substance use ( AOR 2.10; 95 % CI 1.34-3.30).
