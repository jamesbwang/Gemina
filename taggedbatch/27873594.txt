 A serious concern is arising on the coexistence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL) and plasmid mediated quinolone resistance ( PMQR) producing bacteria in animal husbandry , which could be transferred to humans , especially in strains that may not be routinely screened for resistance. This study therefore tested the prevalence of ESBL and PMQR genes in selected bacteria isolated from poultry faeces. Faecal droppings of birds were collected from 11 farms in five states in South Western Nigeria. Bacteria were isolated from the samples on cefotaxime supplemented plates and identified with MALDI-TOF. The MIC was determined using VITEK system and resistance genes were detected with PCR. A total of 350 strains were isolated from different samples and selected strains were identified as 23
