 Duck hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> A<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> 3 ( DHAV-3) , the only member of the novel genus Avihepatovirus , in the family Picornaviridae , can cause significant economic losses for duck farms in China. Reports on the pathogenicity and the antiviral molecular mechanisms of the lethal DHAV-3 strain in ducklings are inadequate and remain poorly understood. We conducted global gene expression profiling and screened differentially expressed genes ( DEG) of duckling liver tissues infected with lethal DHAV-3. There were 1643 DEG and 8979 DEG when compared with mock ducklings at 12 hours post-infection ( hpi) and at 48 hpi , respectively. Gene pathway analysis of DEG highlighted mainly biological processes involved in metabolic pathways , host immune responses , and viral invasion. The results may provide valuable information for us to explore the pathogenicity of the virulent DHAV-3 strain and to improve our understanding of host-virus interactions.
