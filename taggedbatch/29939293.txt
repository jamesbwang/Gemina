 Ixodes<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> ( Acari: Ixodidae) is the principal vector of Borrelia<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> ( the etiologic agent of Lyme<disease> disease<disease>) in the eastern and midwestern United States. Recent efforts have documented the first established population of I.<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> in South Dakota , representing a western expansion of the known species distribution. Our goal was to describe the current distribution of I.<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> in eastern South Dakota and to survey for the presence of B.<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> in questing I.<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen>. We surveyed for the presence of adult and nymphal I.<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> in seven counties within South Dakota , including 13 locales from 2016 to 2017. We then tested all I.<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> , including those collected in 2015 from a previous study , for the presence of B.<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> sensu stricto , via quantitative and conventional polymerase chain reaction. Here , we document the presence of I.<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> in four new counties in South Dakota , and report the first instance of B.<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> in a questing tick in South Dakota. Coupled with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Companion Animal Parasite Council our data show that the risk of contracting Lyme<disease> disease<disease> in South Dakota is low , but existent and should be an important consideration with regard to public health , pets , and wildlife.
