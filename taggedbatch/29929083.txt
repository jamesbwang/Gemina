 The development of a suitable polymeric bioactive composite with hydroxyapatite as a filler is one of the very actively pursued areas in bioapplications. This report concerns development of such a novel polymeric biocomposite viz. poly ( aryl ether) ketone-poly ( dimethylsiloxane) with a small percentage of nano carbon fibres and varying percentages of nanohydroxyapatite particulates as fillers. The earlier characterization of this material involving mechanical , thermal and bio-compatibility studies showed optimum improved behaviour at about 7 % nanohydroxyapatite loading as reported elsewhere. In this study , the wear and friction response of this biocomposite was tested in air under dry sliding conditions against hard steel using a pin-on-disc apparatus. Interestingly , the adhesive wear characteristics of this nanocomposite with varying nanohydroxyapatite percentages showed a trend similar to that in other characteristics with lowest wear occurring around the same nanohydroxyapatite percentage. It was observed that the specific wear rate in this novel nanocomposite was exceptionally low ( ~ 10
