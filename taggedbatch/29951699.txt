 Neural vasopressin is a potent modulator of behaviour in vertebrates. It acts at both sensory processing regions and within larger regulatory networks to mediate changes in social recognition , affiliation , aggression , communication and other social behaviours. There are multiple populations of vasopressin neurons within the brain , including groups in olfactory and visual processing regions. Some of these vasopressin neurons , such as those in the main and accessory olfactory bulbs , anterior olfactory nucleus , piriform cortex and retina , were recently identified using an enhanced green fluorescent protein-vasopressin ( eGFP-VP) transgenic rat. Based on the interconnectivity of vasopressin-producing and sensitive brain areas and in consideration of autocrine , paracrine and neurohormone-like actions associated with somato-dendritic release , we discuss how these different neuronal populations may interact to impact behaviour.
