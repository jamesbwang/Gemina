 Progression of systemic scleroderma ( SSc) , a chronic connective tissue disease that causes a fibrotic phenotype , is highly heterogeneous amongst patients and difficult to accurately diagnose. To meet this clinical need , we developed a novel three-layer classification model , which analyses gene expression profiles from SSc skin biopsies to diagnose SSc severity. Two SSc skin biopsy microarray datasets were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus. The skin scores obtained from the original papers were used to further categorize the data into subgroups of low ( < 18) and high ( â‰¥ 18) severity. Data was pre-processed for normalization , background correction , centering and scaling. A two-layered cross-validation scheme was employed to objectively evaluate the performance of classification models of unobserved data. Three classification models were used: support vector machine , random forest<disease> , and naive Bayes in combination with feature selection methods to improve performance accuracy. For both input datasets , random forest<disease> classifier combined with correlation-based feature selection ( CFS) method and naive Bayes combined with CFS or support vector machine based recursive feature elimination method yielded the best results. Additionally , we performed a principal component analysis to show that low and high severity groups are readily separable by gene expression signatures. Ultimately , we found that our novel classification prediction model produced global gene signatures that significantly correlated with skin scores. This study represents the first report comparing the performance of various classification prediction models for gene signatures from SSc patients , using current clinical diagnostic factors. In summary , our three-classification model system is a powerful tool for elucidating gene signatures from SSc skin biopsies and can also be used to develop a prognostic gene signature for SSc and other fibrotic disorders.
