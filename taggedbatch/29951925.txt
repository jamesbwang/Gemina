 Successful radiotherapy requires precise localization of the tumor and requires high-quality imaging for developing a treatment plan. Irradiation of the tumor region , including a safety margin. The target volume consists of the gross tumor volume ( GTV) containing visible parts of the tumor , the clinical target volume ( CTV) covering the GTV plus invisible tumor extensions , and the planning target volume ( PTV) to account for uncertainties. The non-GTV parts of the CTV are based on historical patient data. The PTV margins are based on a calculation of possible uncertainties during planning , setup , or treatment. Normal tissue deserves the identical care in contouring , since its tolerance may limit the tumor dose , taking into account the contours of organs at risk. Serial risk organs benefit from defining a planning organ of risk volume ( PRV) to better limit the dose delivered to them. The better the imaging , the more reliable the definition of the GTV and treatment success will be. Multiple imaging sequences are desirable to support the delineation of the tumor. They may result in different CTVs that , depending on their tumor burden , may require different doses. The definition of standardized target volumes according to the ICRU reports 50 , 62 , and 83 forms the basis for an individualized radiation treatment planning according to unified criteria on a high-quality level. Radio-oncology is by nature interdisciplinary , the diagnostic radiologist being an indispensable team partner. A regular dialogue between the disciplines is pivotal for target volume definition and treatment success. Imaging for target volume definition requires highest quality imaging , the use of functional imaging methods and close cooperation with a diagnostic radiologist experienced in this field.
