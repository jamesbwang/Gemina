 The quality of 68 samples of 15 different essential children 's medicines sold in licensed medicine outlets in the Ashanti Region , Ghana , was evaluated. Thirty-two ( 47.1 %) of the medicines were imported , mainly from India ( 65.6 %) and the United Kingdom ( 28.1 %) , while 36 ( 52.9 %) were locally manufactured. The quality of the medicines was assessed using content of active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API) , pH , and microbial limit tests , and the results were compared with pharmacopoeial standards. Twenty-six ( 38.2 %) of the samples studied passed the official content of API test while 42 ( 61.8 %) failed. Forty-nine ( 72.1 %) of the samples were compliant with official specifications for pH while 19 ( 27.9 %) were noncompliant. Sixty-six ( 97.1 %) samples passed the microbial load and content test while 2 ( 2.9 %) failed. Eighteen ( 26.5 %) samples passed all the three quality evaluation tests , while one ( 1.5 %) sample ( CFX1) failed all the tests. All the amoxicillin suspensions tested passed the three evaluation tests. All the ciprofloxacin , cotrimoxazole , flucloxacillin , artemether-lumefantrine , multivitamin , and folic acid samples failed the content of API test and are substandard. The overall API failure rate for imported products ( 59.4 %) was comparable to locally manufactured ( 63.9 %) samples. The results highlight the poor quality of the children 's medicines studied and underscore the need for regular pharmacovigilance and surveillance systems to fight this menace.
