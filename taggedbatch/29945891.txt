 Previous genetic studies in mice have shown that functional loss of activin receptor-like kinase 7 ( ALK7) , a type I transforming growth factor-Î² receptor , increases lipolysis to resist fat accumulation in adipocytes. Although growth/differentiation factor 3 ( GDF3) has been suggested to function as a ligand of ALK7 under nutrient-excess conditions , it is unknown how GDF3 production is regulated. Here , we show that a physiologically low level of insulin converts CD11c
