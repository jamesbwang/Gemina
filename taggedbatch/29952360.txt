 We aimed to investigate the feasibility and safety of stand-alone transthoracic echocardiography-guided percutaneous occlusion of patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA) without the use of X-ray equipment. From January to December 2015 , we performed stand-alone transthoracic echocardiography-guided percutaneous PDA occlusion using an occluder delivered via a delivery sheath introduced via femoral vein access without the use of X-ray equipment in 12 PDA patients. PDA occlusion was successfully performed in all 12 patients. The procedure duration ranged from 30 to 110 min ( 50.4 ± 22.8 min) , and the size of the implanted occluder ranged from 12 to 20 mm ( 15.2 ± 2.8 mm). No occluder migration , residual shunt , or thrombotic complications were observed in the perioperative period. There was no clinical death , hemolysis<symptom> , infection , or embolism during patients ' hospitalization and the follow-up period. Stand-alone transthoracic echocardiography-guided percutaneous PDA occlusion without the use of X-ray equipment is a safe and effective procedure.
