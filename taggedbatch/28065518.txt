 The case of a female patient with primary membranous nephropathy is presented. She was treated with corticosteroids and chlorambucil after conservative therapy had failed and went into remission for 5 years. Her nephrotic syndrome<disease><symptom> recurred but did not respond to the same regimen. She had another complete remission after treatment with corticosteroids and cyclosporine , but the nephrosis recurred after 7 years. Again , she failed to respond with retreatment of steroids plus cyclosporine. She was treated with alternate-day steroid plus mycophenolate and , once again , had a complete remission. She was maintained on low-dose mycophenolate for 7 more years. The mycophenolate had to be discontinued because of cytomegalovirus colitis<disease>. Treatment with ganciclovir abolished the colitis<disease>. She is still in remission 10 years later. The case is discussed with regard to current knowledge of the immune pathogenesis of membranous nephropathy as well as the unknowns of the immunogenesis of the disease.
