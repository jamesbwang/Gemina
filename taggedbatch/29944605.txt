 Military load carriage can cause extreme energy expenditure ( EE) that is difficult to estimate due to complex terrain grades and surfaces. Global positioning system ( GPS) devices capture rapid changes in walking speed and terrain but the delayed respiratory<symptom> response<symptom> to movement is problematic. We investigated the accuracy using GPS data in three different equations to estimate EE during complex terrain load carriage. Twelve active duty military personnel ( age , 20 ± 3 yr; height , 174 ± 8 cm; body mass , 85 ± 13 kg) hiked a complex terrain trail on multiple visits under different external load conditions. Energy expenditure was estimated by inputting GPS data into three different equations: the Pandolf- Santee equation , a recent GPS-based equation from de Müllenheim et al.; and the Minimum Mechanics Model. Minute-by-minute EE estimates were exponentially smoothed using smoothing factors between 0.05-0.95 and compared with mobile metabolic sensor EE measurements. The Pandolf- Santee equation had no significant estimation bias ( -2 ± 12 W; p = 0.89). Significant biases were detected for the de Müllenheim equation ( 38 ± 13 W; p = 0.004) and the Minimum Mechanics model ( -101 ± 7 W; p < 0.001). Energy expenditure can be accurately estimated from GPS data using the Pandolf- Santee equation. Applying a basic exponential smoothing factor of 0.5 to GPS data enables more precise tracking of energy expenditure during non-steady state exercise.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
