 The aim of this study was to examine the influence of body mass index ( BMI) on the development of acute kidney injury ( AKI) in critically ill patients in intensive care unit ( ICU). Data of patients admitted to medical ICU from December 2011 to May 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified into three groups according to their BMI: underweight ( < 18.5 kg/m ²) , normal ( 18.5-24.9 kg/m ²) , and overweight ( ≥ 25 kg/m ²). The incidence of AKI was compared among these groups and factors associated with the development of AKI were analyzed. AKI was defined according to the Risk , Injury , Failure , Loss of kidney function , and End-stage ( RIFLE) kidney disease criteria. A total of 468 patients were analyzed. Their mean BMI was 21.5 ± 3.9 kg/m ² , including 102 ( 21.8 %) underweight , 286 ( 61.1 %) normal-weight , and 80 ( 17.1 %) overweight patients. Overall , AKI occurred in 82 ( 17.5 %) patients. The overweight group had significantly ( p < 0.001) higher incidence of AKI ( 36.3 %) than the underweight ( 9.8 %) or normal group ( 15.0 %). In addition , BMI was significantly higher in patients with AKI than that in those without AKI ( 23.4 ± 4.2 vs. 21.1 ± 3.7 , p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that BMI was significantly associated with the development of AKI ( odds ratio , 1.893; 95 % confidence interval , 1.224-2.927). BMI may be associated with the development of AKI in critically ill patients.
