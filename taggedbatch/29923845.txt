 The Patient-Centered Medical Home ( PCMH) now defines excellent primary care. Recent literature has begun to elucidate the components of PCMHs that improve care and reduce costs , but there is little empiric evidence that helps practices , payers , or policy makers understand how high-performing practices have improved outcomes. We report the findings from 38 such practices that fill this gap. We describe how they execute 8 functions that collectively meet patient needs. They include managing populations , providing self-management support coaching , providing integrated behavioral health care , and managing referrals. The functions provide a more actionable perspective on the work of primary care.
