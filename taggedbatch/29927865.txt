 To assess the impact of health worker training on infant feeding practices on the prevalence of functional constipation<symptom> among children at six years of age. Cluster randomised field trial conducted in Porto Alegre , Brazil. Health centers were randomly allocated into intervention ( n = 9) or control ( n = 11) groups. In intervention sites , health workers joined training sessions on the `` Ten Steps for Healthy Feeding for Children from Birth to Two Years of age ''. Pregnant women in the last trimester of both groups were identified , invited to participate and enrolled in the study as the potential mothers to receive the dietary counseling provided by the health workers. At six years of age , the prevalence of functional constipation<symptom> was evaluated based on Rome III , defined by two or more of the following: infrequent defecation , fecal incontinence , history of retentive posturing or/and history of painful defecation. Among 387 mother-child pairs ( 206 intervention , 181 control) evaluated at six years of age , the prevalence of functional constipation<symptom> was lower in the intervention group compared to the control group ( 15.0 % vs 23.9 % , respectively). The probability of being constipated was 38 % lower in the intervention group ( PR = 0.62; 95 % CI 0.44-0.87; P < 0.01). The health workers training to promote the ` Ten Steps ' was an effective way to reduce the prevalence of constipation<symptom> among children at six years of age.
