 Septal leftward motion followed by a counter motion during early systole is known as septal flash ( SF) in patients with isolated complete left bundle-branch block ( cLBBB). This study aimed to determine the predictive value of SF for reduction of left ventricular ( LV) global systolic function using 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography ( 2D STE) in cLBBB patients.Methods and Results: The study group of 41 patients with isolated cLBBB and preserved LV ejection fraction and 41 age- and sex-matched control subjects were studied. The presence of SF and LV global longitudinal strain ( GLS) were defined and measured using 2D STE. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the presence of SF as an independent factor predicting LV GLS > -20 % in isolated cLBBB patients ( odds ratio , 1.38; 95 % confidence interval , 1.10-1.72; P = 0.005). LV GLS in cLBBB patients with SF further decreased over time , whereas LV GLS did not decrease in patients without SF. The presence of SF was shown to be an independent factor predicting the reduction of LV global systolic function ( relative reduction in LV GLS > 15 % from baseline to 2-year follow-up) ( odds ratio , 1.27; 95 % confidence interval , 1.06-1.50; P = 0.008). Assessment of SF by 2D STE may be an easy and effective method of predicting the reduction in LV global systolic function in isolated cLBBB patients.
