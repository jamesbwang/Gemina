 Despite pain prevalence altering with age , the effects of aging on the properties of nociceptors are not well understood. Nociceptors , whose somas are located in dorsal root ganglia , are frequently divided into two groups based on their ability to bind isolectin B4 ( IB4). Here , using cultured neurons from 1- , 3- , 5- , 8- , 12- , and 18-month-old mice , we investigate age-dependent changes in IB4-positive and IB4-negative neurons. Current-clamp experiments at physiological temperature revealed nonlinear changes in firing frequency of IB4-positive , but not IB4-negative neurons , with a peak at 8 months. This was likely due to the presence of proexcitatory conductances activated at depolarized membrane potentials and significantly higher input resistances found in IB4-positive neurons from 8-month-old mice. Repetitive firing in nociceptors is driven primarily by the TTX-resistant sodium current , and indeed , IB4-positive neurons from 8-month-old mice were found to receive larger contributions from the TTX-resistant window current around the resting membrane potential. To further address the mechanisms behind these differences , we performed RNA-seq experiments on IB4-positive and IB4-negative neurons from 1- , 8- , and 18-month-old mice. We found a larger number of genes significantly affected by age within the IB4-positive than IB4-negative neurons from 8-month-old mice , including known determinants of nociceptor excitability. The above pronounced age-dependent changes at the cellular and molecular levels in IB4-positive neurons point to potential mechanisms behind the reported increase in pain sensitivity in middle-aged rodents and humans , and highlight the possibility of targeting a particular group of neurons in the development of age-tailored pain treatments.
