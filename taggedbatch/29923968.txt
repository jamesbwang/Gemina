 A female neonate presented with a pedunculated left lateral epibulbar mass protruding through the eyelids that originated from the temporal cornea and superolateral bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva. She had a cleft in the ipsilateral central upper eyelid with horizontal kink of the tarsus lateral to the cleft and focal patches of alopecia on the scalp. Histopathology of the epibulbar mass revealed conjunctival epithelium with underlying connective tissue , cartilage , bone , adipose , and lacrimal gland consistent with epibulbar dermoid. Genetic testing of the surgical specimen was positive for a KRAS mutation at position 146. MRI showed subarachnoid asymmetry around the left temporal lobe and a C1-C2 enhancing lesion<symptom>. These clinical and molecular findings suggest that this patient has a new clinical variant of oculoectodermal syndrome<disease><symptom> , a rare disorder associated with somatic KRAS gene mutations and characterized clinically by epibulbar dermoids , alopecia , aplasia cutis , brain anomalies , umbilical hernias , and congenital heart defects.
