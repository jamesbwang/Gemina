 More than 5.4 million informal caregivers ( ICGs) in the United States care for persons with dementia ( PWD). Failure of ICGs to incorporate self-care into their routine may lead to adverse health consequences. Caregivers and researchers need to understand the evidence around dementia ICGs ' self-care practices. To synthesize evidence on the self-care needs and behaviors of Alzheimer 's and dementia ICGs and its research implications. PubMed , CINAHL , Scopus , and Web of Science were searched to conduct a systematic review of research. Orem 's self-care theory and a concept analysis of self-management behaviors provided a framework for the review. Three themes emerged from 29 included studies: self-care needs and behaviors of ICGs , barriers to performing self-care , and enablers of self-care. The self-care needs of dementia ICGs included sleep , social engagement and support , and leisure activities. Self-care behaviors identified by this review were engaging in activities with the PWD , spiritual and religious activities , and taking a break from caregiving. Barriers to self-care were gender roles , self-sacrificing , minority ethnicity , and burden of caregiving. Enabling self-care involved acknowledging personal consequences of caregiving , balancing self-care needs with the PWD 's needs , and positioning oneself as an objective/subjective duality. Self-care is a dynamic , challenging aspect to caregiving , but supporting evidence is often limited or can not be generalized. More studies are needed that include random sampling , heterogeneous samples , and quantitative methods. Additional research is needed to understand how self-care needs , behaviors , and barriers differ by caregiver race/ethnicity , gender , or relationship to the PWD.
