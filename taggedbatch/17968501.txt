 The nanotechnology field plays an important role in the improvement of dental implant surfaces. However , the different techniques used to coat these implants with nanostructured materials can differently affect cells , biomolecules and even ions at the nano scale level. The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the structural , biomechanical and histological characterization of nano titania films produced by either modified laser or dip coating techniques on commercially pure titanium implant fixtures. Grade II commercially pure titanium rectangular samples measuring 35 × 12 × 0.25 mm length , width and thickness , respectively were coated with titania films using a modified laser deposition technique as the experimental group , while the control group was dip-coated with titania film. The crystallinity , surface roughness , histological feature , microstructures and removal torque values were investigated and compared between the groups. Compared with dip coating technique , the modified laser technique provided a higher quality thin coating film , with improved surface roughness values. For in vivo examinations , forty coated screw-designed dental implants were inserted into the tibia of 20 white New Zealand rabbits ' bone. Biomechanical and histological evaluations were performed after 2 and 4 weeks of implantation. The histological findings showed a variation in the bone response around coated implants done with different coating techniques and different healing intervals. Modified laser-coated samples revealed a significant improvement in structure , surface roughness values , bone integration and bond strength at the bone-implant interface than dip-coated samples. Thus , this technique can be an alternative for coating titanium dental implants.
