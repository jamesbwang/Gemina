 It is challenging to conduct a pharmacokinetic ( PK) study on mice due to the limited amount of plasma one can obtain , which is also true for some clinical studies. Here , we developed and validated a simple , sensitive and robust LC-MS/MS method for measuring the prodrug valacyclovir ( VACV) and its metabolite acyclovir ( ACV) in mouse and human plasma. This assay utilized an acetonitrile protein precipitation method with isotope-labeled internal standards ( IS) and enabled precise and accurate quantification of VACV and ACV in 10 Î¼L plasma samples with a nine-min gradient. The analytes were separated on a Waters Atlantis T3 C18 column. The precursor-product ion transitions for VACV ( m/z 325.2 > 152.1) , ACV ( m/z 226.2 > 152.1) , VACV-D4 ( m/z 329.2 > 152.1 , IS) and ACV-D4 ( m/z 230.2 > 152.1 , IS) were detected in a multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM) positive ion mode using an API4000 LC-MS/MS system. The lower limit of quantification ( LLOQ) was 2 nM for both VACV and ACV. The linear range was validated over the concentration ranges of 2-200 nM and 200-5000 nM for both compounds. The matrix effect and stability of VACV and ACV were also evaluated. This assay was successfully applied to a PK study in mice.
