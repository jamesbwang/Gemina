 Bioconversion of ethylene glycol ( EG) to glycolic acid ( GA) by the whole-cell of Gluconobacter oxydans<pathogen> in an aired stirred tank reactor ( ASTR) with continuous substrate feeding yielded over 220 g/L of GA.. However , the bioreactor productivity declined to an unfavorable level of 0.63 g/L/h due to negative feed-back by GA which inhibited the reaction. To overcome this problem , based on results obtained from techno-economic comparative analysis , we set up a successive recycled-cell catalytic bioprocessing ASTR , and carried out five consecutive cycles stably during 240 h. At the end of this process , total 490.7 g GA was accumulated with over 90 % yield , and an average bioreactor productivity of 2.04 g/L/h. The twin strategies of end-product titer control and cell-recycling successfully demonstrated the large scale applicability of EG bioconversion to GA..
