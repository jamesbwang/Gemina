 Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> evolves during chronic pulmonary<disease> infections<disease> of cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) patients , forming pathoadapted variants that are persistent. Mucoid and rugose small-colony variants ( RSCVs) are typically isolated from sputum<symptom> of CF patients. These variants overproduce exopolysaccharides in the biofilm extracellular polymeric substance ( EPS). Currently , changes to the biophysical properties of RSCV and mucoid biofilms due to variations in EPS are not well understood. This knowledge may reveal how lung<disease> infections<disease> resist host clearance mechanisms. Here , we used mechanical indentation and shear rheometry to analyse the viscoelasticity of RSCV and mucoid colony-biofilms compared to their isogenic parent at 2- , 4- , and 6-d. While the viscoelasticity of parental colony-biofilms underwent fluctuating temporal changes , in contrast , RSCV and mucoid colony-biofilms showed a gradual progression to more elastic-solid behaviour. Theoretical indices of mucociliary and cough<symptom> clearance predict that mature 6-d parental and RSCV biofilms may show reduced cough<symptom> clearance from the lung , while early mucoid biofilms may show reduced clearance by both mechanisms. We propose that viscoelasticity be considered a virulence property of biofilms.
