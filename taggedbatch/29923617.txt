 Microglia and non-professional immune cells ( endothelial cells , neurons) participate in the recognition and removal of pathogens and tissue debris in the injured central nervous system through major pro-inflammatory processes. However , the mechanisms involved in regulating these responses remain ill-characterized. We herein show that CD93 , also known as complement C1qRp/AA4 stem cell marker , has an important role in the regulation of inflammatory processes. The role of CD93 was evaluated in two models of neuroinflammation. We used the MOG-experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis<pathogen><disease> ( EAE) model and the antibody-dependent EAE ( ADEAE) , which were induced in wild-type and CD93 knockout mice. We found that CD93 was highly expressed by neurons , endothelial cells and microglia ( ramified > amoeboid). Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes did not to express CD93. We further observed that CD93-deficient ( CD93
