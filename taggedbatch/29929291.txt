 Accurately estimating spatial-temporal patterns of gross primary production ( GPP) is important for the global carbon cycle. Satellite-based light use efficiency ( LUE) models are regarded as an efficient tool in simulating spatial-temporal dynamics of GPP. However , the accuracy assessment of GPP simulations from LUE models at both spatial and temporal scales remains a challenge. In this study , we simulated GPP of vegetation in China during 2007-2014 using a LUE model ( Vegetation Photosynthesis Model , VPM) based on MODIS ( moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) images with 8-day temporal and 500-m spatial resolutions and NCEP ( National Center for Environmental Prediction) climate data. Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument 2 ( GOME-2) solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence ( SIF) data were used to compare with VPM simulated GPP ( GPP
