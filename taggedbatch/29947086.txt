 By introducing polar methoxy group into phenyl- or benzyl-phosphonate ligands , four cobalt phosphonates with layered structures are obtained , namely , Co ( 4-mopp) ( H2O) ( 1) , Co ( 4-mobp) ( H2O) ( 2) , Co ( 3-mopp) ( H2O) ( 3) and Co ( 3-mobp) ( H2O) ( 4) , where 4- or 3-moppH2 is ( 4- or 3-methoxyphenyl) phosphonic acid and 4- or 3-mobpH2 is ( 4- or 3-methoxybenzyl) phosphonic acid. Compounds 1 , 2 and 4 crystallize in polar space groups Pmn21 or Pna21 , while compound 3 crystallizes in a centrosymmetric space group P21/n. The layer topologies in the four structures are similar and can be viewed as perovskite-type , where the edge-sharing ( Co4O4) rhombuses are capped by the PO3C groups. The phenyl and Me-O groups in compounds 1-3 are heavily disordered , while that in 4 is ordered. Structural comparison based on the data at 296 K and 123 K reveals distinct dynamic motion of the organic groups in compounds 1 and 2. The fluctuation of polar Me-O groups in these two compounds is confirmed by the dielectric relaxation measurements. In contrast , the fluctuation of polar groups in compounds 3 and 4 is not evident. Interestingly , the dehydrated samples of 3 and 4 ( 3-de and 4-de) exhibit one-step and two-step phase transitions associated with the motion of polar organic groups , as proved by the DSC and dielectric measurements. Magnetic properties of compounds 1-4 are investigated , and strong antiferromagnetic interactions are found to mediate between the magnetic centers through mu-O ( P) and O-P-O bridges.
