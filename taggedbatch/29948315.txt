 In temperate deciduous forests of eastern USA , most earthworm communities are dominated by invasive species. Their structure and functional group composition have critical impacts on ecological properties and processes. However , the factors determining their community structure are still poorly understood , and little is known regarding their dynamics during forest<disease> succession and the mechanisms leading to these changes. Earthworm communities are usually assumed to be stable and driven by vegetation. In contrast , the importance of dispersal and ecological drift is seldom acknowledged. By analyzing a 19-year dataset collected from forest<disease> stands in eastern USA , we demonstrated that on a decadal timescale , earthworm community dynamics are shaped by the interplay of selection , dispersal , and ecological drift. We highlighted that forests at different successional stages have distinct earthworm species and functional groups as a result of environmental filtering through leaf litter quality. Specifically , young forests are characterized by soil-feeding species that rely on relatively fresh soil organic matter derived from fast-decomposing litter , whereas old forests are characterized by those feeding on highly processed soil organic matter derived from slow-decomposing litter. In addition , year-to-year species gains and losses are primarily driven by dispersal from regional to local species pools , and by local extinction resulted from competition and ecological drift. We concluded that with continued dispersal of European species and the recent `` second wave '' of earthworm invasion by Asian species from the surrounding landscape , earthworms at the investigated forests are well-established , and will remain as the major drivers of soil development for the foreseeable future.
