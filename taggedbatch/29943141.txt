 WHO grade II diffuse low-grade gliomas ( DLGGs) were recently divided into sub-groups on the basis of their molecular profiles. IDH wild-type ( IDH-wt) tumors seem to be associated with unfavorable prognoses due to biological similarities to glioblastomas. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature examining epidemiology , clinical characteristics , management , and the outcome of IDH-wt grade II DLGGs. According to PRISMA guidelines , a comprehensive review of studies published from January 2009 to October 2017 was carried out. The authors identified series that examined the prevalence rate , clinical and radiological characteristics , treatment , and outcome of IDH-wt DLGGs. Variables influencing outcomes were analyzed using a random-effects meta-analysis model. Finally , a meta-regression analysis was performed to examine the impact of therapeutic strategies on the effect-size. Twenty-two studies were included in this systematic review. The IDH-wt prevalence rate was 22.9 % ( 95 % CI 18.4-27.4 %). The hazard ratio for this molecular subgroup in the DLGGs population was 3.46 ( 95 % CI 2.24-5.36; p < 0.001) , and the heterogeneity was significant ( I
