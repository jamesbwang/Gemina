 To assess the performance of a symptom index ( SI) and multivariate biomarker panel in the identification of ovarian cancer in women presenting for surgery with an adnexal mass. Prospective study of patients seen at a tertiary medical center. Following consent , patients completed an SI and preoperative serum was collected for individual markers ( CA 125) and a second-generation FDA-cleared biomarker test ( MIA2G). Results for the SI and MIA2G were correlated with operative findings and surgical pathology. Logistic regression modeling was performed to assess the interaction of the SI with MIA2G to determine the risk of malignancy ( ROM). Of the 218 patients enrolled , the mean age was 53.6 years ( range 18-86). One-hundred and forty-seven patients ( 67.4 %) were postmenopausal. Sixty-four patients ( 29.4 %) had epithelial ovarian cancer or fallopian tube cancer ( EOC/FTC) and 17 ( 7.8 %) had borderline ovarian tumors. A positive SI or MIA2G correctly identified 96.1 % of patients with EOC/FTC. Using logistic regression , we found that both SI and MIA2G score were significantly associated with ROM ( p < 0.001). In a simulation with disease prevalence set at 5 % , patients with a negative SI and a MIA2G score of 6 had a ROM of 1.8 % whereas patients with the same MIA2G and positive SI had a 10.5 % ROM , nearly a 6-fold higher risk. The combination of a patient-reported symptom index and refined biomarker panel allows for improved accuracy in the assessment for ovarian cancer in patients with an adnexal mass. This strategy could offer a personalized approach to addressing ROM to triage patients with an adnexal mass to appropriate care.
