 Traumatic brain injury ( TBI) is one of the most devastating forms of brain injury. Many pathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress , apoptosis and inflammation<symptom> all contribute to the secondary brain damage and poor outcomes of TBI. Current therapies are often ineffective and poorly tolerated , which drive the explore of new therapeutic targets for TBI. Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular mechanism during evolution. It plays an important role in elimination abnormal intracellular proteins or organelles to maintain cell stability. Besides , autophagy has been researched in various models including TBI. Previous studies have deciphered that regulation of autophagy by different molecules and pathways could exhibit anti-oxidative stress , anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammation effects in TBI. Hence , autophagy is a promising target for further therapeutic development in TBI. The present review provides an overview of current knowledge about the mechanism of autophagy , the frequently used methods to monitor autophagy , the functions of autophagy in TBI as well as its potential molecular mechanisms based on the pharmacological regulation of autophagy.
