 Regular physical activity appears to attenuate or even reverse age-related arterial stiffening. Yet , it is not clear if the reduced stiffening associated with habitual physical activity is also observed in community-dwelling older adults. Among 3893 older adults in a prospective cohort study , we associated physical activity with measures of central arterial stiffness ( via carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity or cfPWV) and pressure pulsatility ( via central pulse pressure or cPP). We also examined the association of long-term habitual physical activity , measured as persistence in physical activity levels from mid-life to late-life , with cfPWV and cPP among 1747 participants. The adjusted mean difference in cfPWV was lower , reflecting less arterial stiffness , for those with moderate ( ß = -0.30 m/s) or high ( ß = -0.38 m/s) physical activity compared with no physical activity. The adjusted mean difference in cPP was also lower for those with high ( ß = -2.49 mmHg) physical activity , relative to no physical activity. Stronger effect estimates were observed among those with persistent physical activity from mid-life to late-life. Higher physical activity in late-life , and habitual physical activity from mid-life to late-life , is associated with lower central arterial stiffness and pressure pulsatility in a large population-based sample of community-dwelling older adults.
