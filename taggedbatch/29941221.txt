 Renal thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA) involves diverse causes and clinical presentations. Genetic determinants causing alternate pathway complement dysregulation underlie a substantial proportion of cases. In a significant proportion of TMAs , no defect in complement regulation is identified. Mutations in the major mammalian 3 ' DNA repair exonuclease 1 ( TREX1) have been associated with autoimmune and cerebroretinal vasculopathy syndromes<disease><symptom>. Carboxy-terminal TREX1 mutations that result in only altered localization of the exonuclease protein with preserved catalytic function cause microangiopathy of the brain and retina , termed retinal vasculopathy and cerebral leukodystrophy ( RVCL). Kidney involvement reported with RVCL usually accompanies significant brain and retinal microangiopathy. We present a pedigree with autosomal dominant renal TMA and chronic kidney disease found to have a carboxy-terminal frameshift TREX1 variant. Although symptomatic brain and retinal microangiopathy is known to associate with carboxy-terminal TREX1 mutations , this report describes a carboxy-terminal TREX1 frameshift variant causing predominant renal TMA. These findings underscore the clinical importance of recognizing TREX1 mutations as a cause of renal TMA. This case demonstrates the value of whole-exome sequencing in unsolved TMA.
