 The value of indocyanine green ( ICG) test is negatively affected in patients with intrahepatic shunt , ICG excretory defect , or jaundice. This study evaluated Thirteen hepatectomy candidates with ICG retention rates over 40 % were retrospectively analyzed. The ICG clearance rate ( KICG) and estimated KICG obtained by KGSA values were significantly greater than KICG values ( median: 0.12 vs. 0.059; p < 0.01); remKGSA values were greater than remKICG values in all patients ( median: 0.107 vs. 0.0413; p < 0.01). Hepatectomy was considered unsafe in 70 % patients using remKICG , and in none of those using remKGSA; liver failure or postoperative mortality did not occur. None
