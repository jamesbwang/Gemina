 Respiratory<pathogen><disease> syncytial<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( RSV<pathogen>) infection is an important cause of infant mortality. Here , we estimated the potential impact of maternal vaccination against RSV<pathogen> on life-threatening RSV<pathogen> infection in infants. We developed a mathematical model for maternal vaccine-induced antibody dynamics and used characteristics of a maternal RSV<pathogen> vaccine currently in phase 3 of clinical development. The model was applied to data from two cohorts of children younger than 12 months with RSV-related paediatric intensive care unit ( PICU) admission in the United Kingdom ( n = 370) and the Netherlands ( n = 167) , and a cohort of 211 children younger than 12 months with RSV-related in-hospital death from 20 countries worldwide. Our model predicted that , depending on vaccine efficiency , maternal vaccination at 30 weeks ' gestational age could have prevented 62-75 % of RSV-related PICU admissions in the United Kingdom and 76-87 % in the Netherlands. For the global mortality cohort , the model predicted that maternal vaccination could have prevented 29-48 % of RSV-related in-hospital deaths. Preterm children and children with comorbidities were predicted to benefit less than ( healthy) term children. Maternal vaccination against RSV<pathogen> may substantially decrease life-threatening RSV<pathogen> infections in infants.
