 To test whether emergency contraception use in reproductive-aged cancer survivors is higher than in the general U.S. population and evaluate factors associated with use among survivors. A retrospective cohort study compared emergency contraception use between cancer survivors in the Reproductive Window Study on ovarian function after cancer and in the general population in the 2006-2010 National Survey for Family Growth. In a cross-sectional analysis of survivors , multivariable models were used to test associations between participant characteristics and emergency contraception use. Not applicable. A total of 616 female cancer survivors aged 18-40. None. Self-reported emergency contraception use. The mean age of survivors was 33.4 Â± 4.7 , at a mean 7.5 years since diagnosis. Breast cancer ( 22 %) , Hodgkin lymphoma ( 18 %) , and leukemia<disease> ( 8 %) were the most common cancers. Since diagnosis , 156 ( 25.3 %) used emergency contraception , 60 % because of not otherwise using contraception. Age-adjusted prevalence of use was higher in survivors than in the general population ( 28.3 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 24.7-31.9) vs. 12.0 % ( 95 % CI 11.1-12.9)). In multivariable analysis among survivors , nonwhite race ( prevalence ratio ( PR) 1.3 , 95 % CI 1.0-1.8) , breast cancer ( PR 0.6 , 95 % CI 0.4-1.0) , partnered relationship ( PR 0.6 , 95 % CI 0.5-0.9) , and older age ( age 36-40 vs. 31-35; PR 0.7 , 95 % CI 0.5-1.0) were associated with emergency contraception. Female young adult cancer survivors were significantly more likely to use emergency contraception compared with the general population. Populations including nonwhite survivors have a higher risk , suggesting differences in family planning care. Strategies to improve contraception and decrease the need for emergency contraception are needed.
