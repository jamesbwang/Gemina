 We assessed the efficacy and safety of fidaxomicin , a narrow-spectrum macrocyclic antibiotic , for treating inpatients with Clostridioides<pathogen> ( Clostridium<pathogen>) difficile<pathogen> infection ( CDI) in Japan. The objective was to demonstrate the non-inferior efficacy of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin. This Phase III , vancomycin-controlled , double-blind , parallel-group study enrolled adults with CDI. Patients were randomly assigned to receive fidaxomicin ( 200 mg twice daily , orally) or vancomycin ( 125 mg four-times daily , orally) for 10 days. The primary endpoint was global cure rate of CDI ( proportion of patients cured at end of treatment with no recurrence during 28-day follow-up). Non-inferiority margin of 10 % was pre-specified. Two-hundred and twelve patients were randomized and received treatment at 82 hospitals. Global cure rate was 67.3 % ( 70/104) with fidaxomicin and 65.7 % ( 71/108) with vancomycin: difference 1.2 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) -11.3-13.7). Non-inferiority was not demonstrated. Post-hoc analysis in full analysis set patients who received at least 3 days ' treatment revealed a higher global cure rate for fidaxomicin ( 70/97 ( 72.2 %)) than vancomycin ( 71/106 ( 67.0 %)): difference 4.6 % ( 95 % CI -7.9-17.1). Recurrence rate in the full analysis set for recurrence was lower in fidaxomicin- ( 17/87 ( 19.5 %)) than vancomycin-treated ( 24/95 ( 25.3 %)) patients. Adverse event incidences and profiles were similar for both treatments. Though non-inferiority was not demonstrated for fidaxomicin versus vancomycin , global cure rate was numerically higher and recurrence rate lower for fidaxomicin than vancomycin. Fidaxomicin could be an option for the treatment of CDI in an era of reduced antibiotic susceptibility , and to reduce the incidence of recurrence in Japanese patients. CLINICALTRIALS. NCT02179658.
