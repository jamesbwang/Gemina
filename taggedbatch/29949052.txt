 Online education is effective for knowledge acquisition , but its effect on clinical skill development is not well characterized. We aimed to compare communication skills of 50 first-year medical students who learned to assess and treat patients through an online learning module vs an in-class lecture. Twenty-six students were randomized to learn about antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction in class and 24 learned the same content through an online module. Students were individually observed conducting an interview with a standardized patient with antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction. Students were assessed by faculty raters blinded to the student 's learning mode. Standardized patients were asked about their willingness to have the student as their physician. More students who learned in class vs online demonstrated appropriate verbal empathy ( 18 ( 69 %) vs 8 ( 33 %); P = 0.01) , defined as completing each task in the `` verbal empathy '' assessment domain , as measured by a faculty rater. Other assessed variables were not significantly different. Standardized patients ' willingness ( vs unwillingness; P = 0.01) to have the student as their physician was associated with the demonstration ( by faculty appraisal) of a number of basic skills: using open-ended questions , asking one question at a time , using gender-neutral terminology when asking about the patient 's relationship , and using appropriate sexual-health terminology. This study , although limited by a single-site design and the small number of participants , offers preliminary evidence that , if confirmed , may suggest that in-class learning from a psychiatrist ( vs from an online module) is associated with greater verbal empathy in the assessment of SSRI-related sexual dysfunction.
