 We evaluated the efficacy of new flavonoids mixture ( diosmin , troxerutin , rutin , hesperidin , quercetin) to reduce bleeding from I-III degrees hemorrhoidal disease in the short and medium time. One hundred fifty-four consecutive patients with hemorrhoidal disease recruited in four colorectal units were enrolled to the study. Exclusion criteria were allergy to the flavonoids , inflammatory bowel disease , obstructed defecation syndrome<disease><symptom> , pregnancy and puerperium , associated anal disease or hemorrhoidal thrombosis , proctologic surgical procedures within 1 year before recruitment , contemporary cancer or HIV<pathogen> , previous pelvic radiotherapy , patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy , or contemporary administration of other therapy for hemorrhoids. Patients with inability to understand the study or mental disorders were also excluded. Seventy-eight were randomized to receive the mixture of diosmin , troxerutin , rutin , hesperidin , and quercetin ( study group , SG) , and 76 a mixture of diosmin in combination with hesperidin , diosmetin , isoroifolin , and linarin in purified micronized fraction ( control group , CG). Bleeding , number of pathological piles , and Golligher 's grade were assessed at each scheduled visit and compared using the Chi-square test. During the study period , bleeding improved after 1 and 6 months both in the SG ( 79.5 and 70.5 %) and in the CG ( 80.2 and 75 %) without significant differences between two groups. Satisfaction degree after 6 months was greater in the patients of the SG ( 4.05) towards the CG ( 3.25): this result was statistical significant ( p 0.003). Use of flavonoids mixture ( diosmin , troxerutin , rutin , hesperidin , quercetin) is a safe and effective mean of managing bleeding from hemorrhoidal disease and minimal adverse events are reported.
