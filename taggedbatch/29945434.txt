 In patients with haemodynamic instability echocardiography has been recommended as the preferred modality to evaluate the underlying pathophysiology. However , due to the fact that recent scientific data on the utilisation of echocardiography in German intensive care units ( ICU) are scarce , we sought to investigate current practice. A structured , web-based , anonymised survey was performed from May until July 2015 among members of the German Interdisciplinary Association of Critical Care and Emergency Medicine ( DIVI) consisting of 14 questions. Descriptive data analysis was performed. 104 intensivists participated in the survey. Two-thirds of participants ( 66 %) used echocardiography regularly for haemodynamic monitoring and stated that it changed the therapy in 26-50 % of the cases irrespective of the time performed after ordering the examination. Transthoracic ( TTE) were more frequently used than transoesophageal ( TEE) examinations. Twenty-six percent of the participants held an echocardiography certificate with a formal examination , 27 % completed a structured training without an examination and almost half of the questioned ICU personnel ( 47 %) did not complete a comprehensive training. The results of this survey demonstrate a widespread utilisation of echocardiography as part of routine diagnostic on frequent number of operative ICUs. However , there might be a lack of structured echocardiographic training especially for anaesthesiologists.
