 Bangladesh is one of the world 's most vulnerable countries for climate change. This observational study examined the association of temperature , humidity and rainfall with six common climate-sensitive infectious<disease> diseases<disease> in adults ( malaria<disease> , diarrheal disease , enteric<disease> fever<disease><symptom> , encephalitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> , pneumonia<disease> and bacterial meningitis<disease><symptom>) in northeastern Bangladesh. Subjects admitted to the adult medicine ward of a tertiary referral hospital in Sylhet , Bangladesh from 2008 to 2012 with a diagnosis of one of the six chosen climate-sensitive infectious<disease> diseases<disease> were enrolled in the study. Climate-related data were collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological Institute. Disease incidence was then analyzed against mean temperature , humidity and average rainfall for the Sylhet region. Statistical significance was determined using Mann-Whitney test , Chi-square test and ANOVA testing. 5033 patients were enrolled ( 58 % male , 42 % female , ratio 1.3:1). All six diseases showed highly significant ( p = 0.01) rises in incidence between the study years 2008 ( 540 cases) and 2012 ( 1330 cases) , compared with no significant rise in overall all-cause hospital admissions in the same period ( p = 0.19). The highest number of malaria<disease> ( 135) , diarrhea<disease><symptom> ( 266) and pneumonia<disease> ( 371) cases occurred during the rainy season. On the other hand , the maximum number of enteric<disease> fever<disease><symptom> ( 408) , encephalitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> ( 183) and meningitis<disease><symptom> ( 151) cases occurred during autumn , which follows the rainy season. A positive ( P = 0.01) correlation was observed between increased temperature and the incidence of malaria<disease> , enteric<disease> fever<disease><symptom> and diarrhea<disease><symptom> , and a negative correlation with encephalitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> , meningitis<disease><symptom> and pneumonia<disease>. Higher humidity correlated ( P = 0.01) with a higher number of cases of malaria<disease> and diarrhea<disease><symptom> , but inversely correlated with meningitis<disease><symptom> and encephalitis<pathogen><disease><symptom>. Higher incidences of encephalitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> and meningitis<disease><symptom> occurred while there was low rainfall. Incidences of diarrhea<disease><symptom> , malaria<disease> and enteric<disease> fever<disease><symptom> , increased with rainfall , and then gradually decreased. The findings support a relationship between weather patterns and disease incidence , and provide essential baseline data for future large prospective studies.
