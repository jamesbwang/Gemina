 To improve surgical planning and reduce fasting times with a tool designed to predict average surgical times for the commonest orthopaedic trauma operations. A prospective cohort study comprising two 2-week periods before and after introduction of a surgical planning tool. The tool was used in the post-intervention group to predict surgical times for each patient and the predicted end-time for each list. The study was conducted in a UK trauma unit with consecutive orthopaedic trauma patients listed for surgery with no exclusions. A surgical planning tool was generated by analysing 5146 electronic records for trauma procedure times. Average surgical times for the commonest 20 procedures were generated with 95 % confidence intervals. The primary outcome measure was number of patients fasted for a single day. The secondary outcome measures were the day of surgery and total fast times for food and fluids. After introduction of the planning tool , patients were more likely to fast for only one day ( 65 % 46/71 vs 53 % 40/75 , p < 0.05). Day of surgery food fast was significantly lower with use of the surgical planning tool ( 13:11 h to 11:44 h , p < 0.05). Fast times were lower for patients with hip fractures after the intervention , with a reduction in day of surgery fast from 8:25 h to 4:28 h ( p < 0.05) and a total fluid fast of 13:00 h to 4:31 h ( p < 0.001). Introduction of a surgical planning tool was associated with a decrease in fasting times for orthopaedic trauma patients with no patient cancelled for not being adequately fasted.
