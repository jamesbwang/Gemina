 Metabolomics is essential to understand the metabolism and identify engineering targets to improve the performances of strains and bioprocesses. Although numerous metabolomics techniques have been developed and applied to various organisms , the metabolome of Saccharopolyspora erythraea , a native producer of erythromycin , had never been studied. The 2017 best paper of Bioprocess and Biosystems Engineering reports examination of three methods for quenching and extraction to analyze the intracellular metabolome of S. erythraea , and identified the most reliable methods for studying different groups of the metabolites. Subsequent studies on the dynamics of the intracellular metabolome of S. erythraea during the fed-batch fermentation identified a positive correlation between the specific erythromycin production rate and the pool size of intracellular propionyl-CoA and other precursors of erythromycin. A series of follow-up studies , such as demonstrating the applicability of the quenching/extraction methods in other related antibiotic producers , demonstrating the generality of the best matches between the quenching/extraction methods and the metabolite groups , and combining metabolomics approaches with the fluxomics and systems metabolic engineering approaches , will facilitate the metabolomics studies on important antibiotic producers , enable standardization of the quenching/extraction protocols , and improve the performance of the antibiotic production with deeper insight into their metabolism.
