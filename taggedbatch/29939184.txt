 We demonstrate the use of two nuclear-based analytical methods that can follow the modifications of microstructural arrangement of iron-based metallic glasses ( MGs). Despite their amorphous nature , the identification of hyperfine interactions unveils faint structural modifications. For this purpose , we have employed two techniques that utilize nuclear resonance among nuclear levels of a stable
