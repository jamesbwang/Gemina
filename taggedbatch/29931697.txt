 Tin selenide ( SnSe) has attracted much attention in the field of thermoelectrics since the discovery of the record figure of merit ( ZT) of 2.6 Â± 0.3 along the b-axis of the material. The record ZT is attributed to an ultralow thermal conductivity that arises from anharmonicity in bonding. While it is known that nanostructuring offers the prospect of enhanced thermoelectric performance , there have been minimal studies in the literature to date of the thermoelectric performance of thin films of SnSe. In this work , preferentially orientated porous networks of thin film SnSe nanosheets are fabricated using a simple thermal evaporation method , which exhibits an unprecedentedly low thermal conductivity of 0.08 W m
