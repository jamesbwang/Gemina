 This study evaluated mental health characteristics and beliefs of student service members/veterans ( SSM/V) who have been exposed to another 's death by suicide. A total of 39 SSM/Vs exposed to suicide and 32 SSM/Vs not exposed to suicide were sampled from a larger , epidemiological survey. An age- and gender-matched group of 39 civilian ( C) students was drawn from a larger sample of individuals exposed to suicide. Data were collected as part of an internet-based , campus needs survey that occurred in Fall 2014. Participants were asked to complete measures about suicide-related behaviors , suicide prevention , help-seeking , and demographics. SSM/Vs exposed to suicide had more positive mental health/suicide prevention beliefs than SSM/Vs not exposed to suicide. Cs exposed to suicide were not significantly different from either group. Unique help-seeking patterns were also identified. The current study identifies unique characteristics of SSM/Vs exposed to suicide that may inform prevention programming.
