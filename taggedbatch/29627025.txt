 Stanford type A acute aortic dissection requires emergency surgery. Because patients with ischemic stroke as a complication of Stanford type A acute aortic dissection do not often complain of chest or back pain , probably due to consciousness<symptom> disturbance , amnesia , or aphasia<symptom> , a fatal course following inappropriate intravenous rt-PA therapy and delay of appropriate surgical treatment sometimes occur. When treating any suspected stroke patients , emergency services and initial urgent care doctors should always suspect aortic dissection. Even in the absence of chest or back pain , the initial urgent care doctor needs to immediately perform chest contrast CT if suspecting aortic dissection from blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> laterality or upper mediastinal widening on chest X-ray. Whenever aortic dissection can not be ruled out from initial clinical information , the initial urgent care doctor should evaluate the common carotid artery ( CCA). Dissection extension to the CCA or flow abnormality of the CCA is often detected if aortic dissection is a cause of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Head CT or MRI including vascular imaging is preferable. D-dimer should be measured in hospitals where available. As soon as aortic dissection is identified , the initial urgent care doctor needs to consult with cardiovascular surgeons or cardiologists for appropriate treatment.
