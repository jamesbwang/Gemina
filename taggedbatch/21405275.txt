 Conventional concentrators with inhomogeneous coating materials that fully enclose the destined region pose great challenges for fabrication. In this paper , we propose to design an EM concentrator with homogeneous materials. Distinguished from conventional ones , the elaborately designed EM concentrator features a concentrator region that is open to the outer-world , which is achieved with multi-folded transformation optics method by compressing and folding the coating materials to create window ( s). Based on this concept , we also investigate open-rotator and open rotational-concentrator devices , which could simultaneously rotate and store the EM waves in the central destined region. Due to the open nature of our proposed designs , we believe they will find potential applications in remote controlling with impressive new functionalities.
