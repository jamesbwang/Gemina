 While there has been consistent evidence that symptoms reported by individuals who suffer from Idiopathic Environmental Intolerance attributed to Electromagnetic Fields ( IEI-EMF) are not caused by EMF and are more closely associated with a nocebo effect , whether this response is specific to IEI-EMF sufferers and what triggers it , remains unclear. The present experiment tested whether perceived EMF exposure could elicit symptoms in healthy participants , and whether viewing an ` alarmist ' video could exacerbate a nocebo response. Participants were randomly assigned to watch either an alarmist ( N = 22) or control video ( N = 22) before completing a series of sham and active radiofrequency ( RF) EMF exposure provocation trials ( 2 open-label , followed by 12 randomized , double-blind , counterbalanced trials). Pre- and post-video state anxiety<symptom> and risk perception , as well as belief of exposure and symptom ratings during the open-label and double-blind provocation trials , were assessed. Symptoms were higher in the open-label RF-ON than RF-OFF trial ( p < .001). No difference in either symptoms ( p = .183) or belief of exposure ( p = .144) was observed in the double-blind trials. Participants who viewed the alarmist video had a significant increase in symptoms ( p = .041) , state anxiety<symptom> ( p < .01) and risk perception ( p < .001) relative to the control group. These results reveal the crucial role of awareness and belief in the presentation of symptoms during perceived exposure to EMF , showing that healthy participants exhibit a nocebo response , and that alarmist media reports emphasizing adverse effects of EMF also contribute to a nocebo response.
