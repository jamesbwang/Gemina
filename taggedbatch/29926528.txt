 Due to substantial phonon scattering induced by various structural defects , the in-plane thermal conductivity ( K) of graphene films ( GFs) is still inferior to the commercial pyrolytic graphite sheet ( PGS). Here , the problem is solved by engineering the structures of GFs in the aspects of grain size , film alignment , and thickness , and interlayer binding energy. The maximum K of GFs reaches to 3200 W m
