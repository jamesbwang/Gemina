 Identifing potential screening tests for future cognitive decline is a priority for developing treatments for and the prevention of dementia. To examine the potential of retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL) thickness measurement in identifying those at greater risk of cognitive decline in a large community cohort of healthy people. UK Biobank is a prospective , multicenter , community-based study of UK residents aged 40 to 69 years at enrollment who underwent baseline retinal optical coherence tomography imaging , a physical examination , and a questionnaire. The pilot study phase was conducted from March 2006 to June 2006 , and the main cohort underwent examination for baseline measures from April 2007 to October 2010. Four basic cognitive tests were performed at baseline , which were then repeated in a subset of participants approximately 3 years later. We analyzed eyes with high-quality optical coherence tomography images , excluding those with eye disease or vision loss<symptom> , a history of ocular or neurological disease , or diabetes. We explored associations between RNFL thickness and cognitive function using multivariable logistic regression modeling to control for demographic as well as physiologic and ocular variation. Odds ratios ( ORs) for cognitive performance in the lowest fifth percentile in at least 2 of 4 cognitive tests at baseline , or worsening results on at least 1 cognitive test at follow-up. These analyses were adjusted for age , sex , race/ethnicity , height , refraction , intraocular pressure , education , and socioeconomic status. A total of 32038 people were included at baseline testing , for whom the mean age was 56.0 years and of whom 17172 ( 53.6 %) were women. A thinner RNFL was associated with worse cognitive performance on baseline assessment. A multivariable regression controlling for potential confounders showed that those in the thinnest quintile of RNFL were 11 % more likely to fail at least 1 cognitive test ( 95 % CI , 2.0 % -2.1 %; P = .01). Follow-up cognitive tests were performed for 1251 participants ( 3.9 %). Participants with an RNFL thickness in the 2 thinnest quintiles were almost twice as likely to have at least 1 test score be worse at follow-up cognitive testing ( quintile 1: OR , 1.92; 95 % CI , 1.29-2.85; P < .001; quintile 2: OR , 2.08; 95 % CI , 1.40-3.08; P < .001). A thinner RNFL is associated with worse cognitive function in individuals without a neurodegenerative disease as well as greater likelihood of future cognitive decline. This preclinical observation has implications for future research , prevention , and treatment of dementia.
