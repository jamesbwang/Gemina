 Statins and/or PCSK9 inhibitors cause the regression of coronary atheroma and reduce clinical events. However , it currently remains unclear whether these drugs modulate coronary atheroma calcification in vivo. Coronary artery calcium ( CAC) scores ( Agatston Units , AUs) were estimated in 120 patients receiving coronary computed tomographic angiography ( CCTA) ( 63 % males; median age 56 years). The CAC scores were compared among the three groups: ( 1) neither statin nor PCSK9 inhibitor therapy , ( 2) statin monotherapy , and ( 3) statin and PCSK9 inhibitor combination therapy in an unpaired cross-sectional study. Additionally , CCTA was performed twice at an interval in 15 patients undergoing statin monotherapy to compare the previous ( baseline) and subsequent ( follow-up) CAC scores in a paired longitudinal study. In addition , a PCSK9 inhibitor was administered to 16 patients undergoing statin therapy. Before and after that , CCTA was performed twice to compare the previous and subsequent CAC scores in a paired longitudinal study. The unpaired cross-sectional study and paired longitudinal study consist of completely different patients. Among 120 patients , 40 ( 33 %) had a CAC score > 100 AUs. The median CAC score increased in the following order: statin group , statin and PCSK9 group , and no-statin-no-PCSK9 group. Annual CAC score progression was 29.7 % by statin monotherapy and 14.3 % following the addition of the PCSK9 inhibitor to statin therapy. The annual rate of CAC with the combination therapy with a PCSK9 inhibitor and a statin is lower than that with statin monotherapy. CAC may be prevented with PCSK9 Inhibitor.
