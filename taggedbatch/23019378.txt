 RNA silencing is a powerful tool deployed by plants against viral<disease> infection<disease> and abnormal gene expression. Plant viruses have evolved a suite of silencing suppressors for counter-defense , which are also widely used to boost transcript and protein accumulation in transient assays. However , only wild type silencing suppressor proteins have been reported to date. Here we demonstrate that P0 of Potato leafroll virus ( PLRV) , PLP0 , can be split into two proteins that only show silencing suppression activity upon co-expression. We cloned each of these proteins in two different constructs and transiently co-infiltrated them in N. benthamiana leaves. We expressed a fluorescent protein from one of the vectors and observed that cells expressing both halves of PLP0 suppressed gene silencing. Further , we showed that Q system of Neurospora<pathogen> crassa , based on co-expression of a transcription activator and inhibitor , is functional in agroinfiltrated leaves of N. benthamiana. Q system combined with the split PLP0 system showed very tight co-expression of Q system 's transcriptional activator and inhibitor. Altogether , our experiments demonstrate a functioning conditional silencing suppressor system and its potential as a powerful tool for transient expression in N. benthamiana leaves , as well as the application of the Q system in plants.
