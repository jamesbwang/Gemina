 Parent-infant interaction is known to be influenced bidirectionally by parent and infant characteristics. However , it is unclear whether infant temperament affects parents ' neural responses to infant stimuli. 85 infants ( 6-12 months) were filmed in distress-eliciting tasks , which were coded for infants ' negative affect. Mothers ' reported infant affect was obtained from the Infant Behavior Questionnaire Very Short Form-Revised. Mothers ' EEG activity was recorded while passively viewing photos of own , familiarized , and unfamiliar infants. Multiple regression indicated that mothers who reported greater infant negative affect showed a smaller difference in the late positive potential ( LPP) response to own infant versus familiarized infant , controlling for researcher-coded infant negative affect. The findings suggest that parents ' perceptions of their infant 's temperament , but not independent measures of infant temperament , are related to electrocortical indices of emotional attention.
