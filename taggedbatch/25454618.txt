 Classically , prostate cancer has been diagnosed via systematic , transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy prompted by an abnormal digital rectal exam or elevated serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) level. The development of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) has led to improved detection of prostate cancer foci. For patients with clinically localized prostate cancer seeking definitive therapy through radiation therapy , external beam radiation has been a mainstay with a movement toward hypofractionation , notably prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT). We aim to describe the practical aspects of establishing a multidisciplinary , MRI-based prostate SBRT program by means of case examples. The prostate SBRT team at the University of Alabama at Birmingham has been performing prostate SBRT for over four years using a multidisciplinary workflow. We have additionally completed a phase II trial of prostate SBRT with additional targeting of intraprostatic lesions<symptom> with higher doses of radiation using a simultaneous integrated boost technique. While there have been no reported randomized trials of prostate SBRT , this treatment has been proven safe and effective for properly selected patients with low and intermediate-risk prostate cancer. We present our multidisciplinary approach to prostate SBRT with two clinical cases targeting high-risk ( MAM1) lesions<symptom> in different anatomic zones of the prostate highlighting pertinent clinical challenges in successfully delivering prostate SBRT and managing potential side effects. In conclusion , we report a multidisciplinary , MRI-based approach to treating patients with ultra hyperfractionated stereotactic radiosurgery as primary definitive treatment for prostate cancer.
