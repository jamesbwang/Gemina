 The aim of this pooled analysis was to assess the efficacy and safety of umeclidinium/vilanterol ( UMEC/VI) 62.5/ 25 µg dual bronchodilation versus placebo in elderly symptomatic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). We conducted a post hoc pooled analysis of data from 10 randomized controlled trials ( RCTs). Change from baseline ( CFB) in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV The UMEC/VI intent-to-treat ( ITT) populations comprised 2246 , 1296 , and 472 patients in the 12-week parallel-group , 24-week parallel-group , and 12-week crossover analysis , respectively ( ≥ 65 years: 36-44 %; ≥ 75 years: 7-11 %). The placebo ITT populations comprised 528 , 280 , and 505 patients , respectively ( ≥ 65 years: 37-41 %; ≥ 75 years: 5-11 %). Significant improvements in trough FEV In this pooled analysis of RCT data , once-daily UMEC/VI was well tolerated and provided clinically significant lung function benefits compared with placebo in younger and older patients with COPD.
