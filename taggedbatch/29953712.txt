 The substrate flexibility of eight purified sesquiterpene cyclases was evaluated using six new heteroatom modified farnesyl pyrophosphates and the formation of six new heteroatom-modified macrocyclic and tricyclic sesquiterpenoids is described. GC-O analysis revealed that tricyclic furan exhibits an ethereal , peppery and camphor-like olfactoric scent.
