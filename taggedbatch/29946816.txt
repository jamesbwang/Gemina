 Pre-diabetes , a risk factor for post-transplant diabetes mellitus ( PTDM) , represents an early therapeutic target for prevention of PTDM. We evaluated glucose metabolism post-transplantation and the ability to predict pre-diabetes and PTDM from haemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c) levels at 90 days , at 1 year , and at 3 years in long-term post-transplantation follow-up. HbA1c levels were measured in 71 non-diabetic deceased-donor transplant recipients at four time points ( during transplantation , 90-days post-transplantation , 1-year post-transplantion , and at the final post-transplantation follow-up visit 2.71 ± 1.26 years after transplantation). The predictive power of HbA1c levels at 90 days post-transplantation was determined by calculating the sensitivity , specificity , false-positive rates , and false-negative rates. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine risk factors for pre-diabetes and PTDM at 1-year post-transplantation and at the last follow-up visit ( 2.71 ± 1.26 years after renal transplantation). HbA1c values ≥ 5.7 % were seen in 79 % of patients at 90 days post-transplant , in 83 % at 1 year , and in 69 % of patients on follow-up. HbA1c cut-off levels of < 5.7 % or ≥ 5.7 % showed the highest predictive sensitivity for pathological HbA1c levels ( ≥ 5.7 %) at 1 year post-transplantation ( 0.83) and at last follow-up ( 0.86) , whereas cut-off levels of < 6.2 % or. ≥ 6.2 % showed the highest specificity ( 0.97 and 1.00 , respectively). The HbA1c level at 90 days was a risk factor for disturbed glucose-metabolism at 1 year ( p = 0.000) and at the final follow-up ( p = 0.031). HbA1c levels at 90 days post-transplantation are predictive of disturbed glucose metabolism at 1 year and on long-term follow-up and may serve as predictive tools for early therapeutic interventions to prevent PTDM.
