 Recurrence is one of the major causes of poor prognosis for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) , and drug resistance is closely associated with disease recurrence. Histone deacetylase ( HDAC) inhibitor scriptaid functions as an anticancer agent in many different types of tumors , but its possible roles in HCC progression have not been explored to date. Herein , we show that HDAC inhibitor scriptaid decreases HCC cell proliferation and induces cell cycle G
