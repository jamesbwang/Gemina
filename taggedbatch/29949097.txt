 A consensus has emerged that the cerebellum makes important contributions to a spectrum of linguistic processes , but that the psychobiology of these contributions remains enigmatic ( MariÃ«n et al. , Cerebellum 13 ( 3): 386-410 , 2014). One aspect of this enigma arises from the fact that , although the language-dominant left cerebral hemisphere is connected to the right cerebellum , distinctive contributions of the left cerebellar hemisphere have been documented ( Murdoch and Whelan , Folia Phoniatr Logop 59:184-9 , 2007) , but remain poorly understood. Here , we report that neurodisruption of the left and right cerebellar hemispheres have opposite effects on associative word priming in a lexical decision task. Reaction time was measured for decisions on whether a target letter string constituted a word ( e.g. bread) or , with equal probability , a pronounceable non-word ( e.g. dreab). A prime word was presented for 150 ms before the target and could either , and with equal probability , be related ( e.g. BUTTER) or unrelated ( TRACTOR). Associative word priming was computed as the reduction in lexical decision RT on trials with related primes. Left cerebellar hemisphere continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS) decreased , and right hemisphere stimulation increased , priming. The results suggest that the cerebellum contributes to predictive sequential processing , in this case language , through an opponent process mechanism coordinated by both cerebellar hemispheres.
