 In this study , a highly efficient and eco-friendly porous cellulose-based aerogel was synthesized by grafting polyethyleneimine onto quaternized cellulose ( PQC) to remove the anionic dye Congo Red ( CR). The prepared aerogel had a good flexibility and formability. The adsorbents were characterized by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR) spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The results showed that there were many amino groups on CE/PQC aerogel and the structure was porous , which increased the adsorption capacity. The effects of initial concentration , adsorbent dose , contact time , temperature , and pH on the dye sorption were all investigated. The adsorption mechanism was also explored , including adsorption kinetics , adsorption isotherms and thermodynamic studies of adsorption. The results showed that the adsorption kinetics and isotherms fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm , respectively. The Langmuir isotherm revealed that the maximum theoretical adsorption capacity of the aerogels for CR was 518.403 mg g
