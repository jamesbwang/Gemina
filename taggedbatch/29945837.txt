 Manufacturers often recommend the iliac arteries as the distal landing zone in fenestrated or branched endovascular aortic repair ( FB-EVAR) for thoracoabdominal aneurysm<disease>. It is not uncommon to choose distal landing at the infrarenal aorta for preservation of lumbar arteries or the inferior mesenteric artery ( IMA); however , the safety and durability of this procedure have not been verified in the literature. Consecutive patients who underwent FB-EVAR with distal landing at the infrarenal aorta were reviewed retrospectively. The primary outcome measured any type IB endoleak over time. Secondary outcomes measured perioperative complications of paraplegia<symptom> and bowel ischemia , preservation of lumbar artery and IMA , and degeneration of infrarenal aorta ( diameter of infrarenal aorta at landing zone) and common iliac arteries ( maximum diameters) over time. Between August 2011 and August 2017 , 40 patients ( 40 % male with a mean age of 72 ± 8 years) affected by types I ( 37.5 %) , II ( 25.0 %) , III ( 20.0 %) , and V ( 17.5 %) thoracoabdominal aneurysms<disease> were included. The mean aneurysm<disease> diameter was 6.4 ± 1.5 cm. There was no immediate or delayed type IB endoleak with mean follow-up period of 15 ± 18 months ( range , 0-72 months). Postoperative complications included six ( 15 %) spinal<disease> cord ischemia ( five temporary and one permanent) and no mesenteric ischemia. There were three deaths ( 7.5 %) within 30 days. Follow-up with computed tomography arteriography showed that 37 patients ( 92.5 %) had at least one lumbar artery preserved. Out of the 31 preoperatively patent IMA , 23 ( 74.2 %) were preserved. There was one incidental finding of new focal dissection distal to the stent graft end. Mean infrarenal aorta diameters were 24.8 , 27.7 , 27.7 , and 29.4 mm immediately preoperatively , and at 1 and 2 years postoperatively , respectively. The mean maximal right common iliac diameters were stable and measured 15.8 , 15.9 , and 14.8 mm preoperatively , immediately postoperatively , and 1 year postoperatively , respectively. Mean maximal left common iliac diameters were also stable and measured 15.7 , 15.9 , and 14.7 mm preoperatively , immediately postoperatively , and at 1 year postoperatively , respectively. Our early experience showed that distal landing at the infrarenal aorta was secure in FB-EVAR with no type IB endoleak , although the observation of gradual infrarenal aortic degeneration mandates regular surveillance.
