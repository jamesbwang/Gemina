 The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy ( FTIR) on Attenuated Total Reflectance ( ATR) in the determination of the fatty acid content in meat and meat products. The Multivariate calibrations were developed and proposed for Saturated Fatty Acids ( SFA) , Monounsatured Fatty Acids ( MUFA) , Polyunsatured Fatty Acids ( PUFA) and Palmitic Acid. SFA and MUFA models , developed using the first derivative and the selected region 3022.33-650.15 cm
