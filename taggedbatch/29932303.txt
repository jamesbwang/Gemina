 Lysine crotonylation ( Kcr) is a recently identified post-translational modification ( PTM) that is regulated by an acetyltransferase , p300. The p300-catalyzed histone Kcr is able to stimulate transcription to a greater degree than the well-studied histone lysine acetylation ( Kac). Despite these progresses , the global Kcr substrates regulated by p300 remain largely unknown , hindering efforts to establish mechanistic links between Kcr and p300-mediated phenotypes. Here , a quantitative proteomics study to characterize the p300-regulated lysine crotonylome is reported. A total of 816 unique endogenous crotonylation sites are identified across 392 proteins , with 88 sites from 69 proteins being decreased by more than 0.7-fold ( log2 < 0.5) and 31 sites from 17 proteins being increased by more than 1.4-fold ( log2 > 0.5) in response to p300 knockout ( KO). The most downregulated crotonylome alterations under p300 deficiency concern components of the nonsense-mediated decay , infectious<disease> disease<disease> , and viral/eukaryotic translation pathways. Moreover , some p300-targeted Kcr substrates are potentially linked to diseases such as cancer. Taken together , this study reveals the lysine crotonylome in response to p300 , which sheds light on the role for lysine crotonylation in regulation of diverse cellular processes and provides new insights into mechanisms of p300 functions.
