 We investigated the association of alcohol intake with mammographic breast density in postmenopausal women by their hormone therapy ( HT) status. This study included 2,100 cancer-free postmenopausal women within the Nurses ' Health Study and Nurses ' Health Study II cohorts. Percent breast density ( PD) , absolute dense ( DA) , and non-dense areas ( NDA) were measured from digitized film mammograms using a computer-assisted thresholding technique; all measures were square root transformed. Alcohol consumption was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire ( 0 , < 5 , and ≥ 5 g/day). Information regarding breast cancer risk factors was obtained from baseline or biennial questionnaires closest to the mammogram date. We used generalized linear regression to examine associations between alcohol and breast density measures in women with no HT history , current , and past HT users. In multivariable analyses , we found no associations of alcohol consumption with PD ( p trend = 0.32) and DA ( p trend = 0.53) and an inverse association with NDA ( β =- 0.41 , 95 % CI- 0.73 ,- 0.09 for ≥ 5 g/day , p trend < 0.01). In the stratified analysis by HT status , alcohol was not associated with PD in any of the strata. We found a significant inverse association of alcohol with NDA among past HT users ( β =- 0.79 , 95 % CI- 1.51 ,- 0.07 for ≥ 5 g/day , p trend = 0.02). There were no significant interactions between alcohol and HT in relation to PD , DA , and NDA ( p interaction = 0.19 , 0.42 , and 0.43 , respectively). Our findings suggest that associations of alcohol with breast density do not vary by HT status.
