 The World Health Organization Surgical Safety Checklist ( WHO SSC) has been widely implemented in an effort to decrease surgical adverse events. The effects of the checklist on postoperative outcomes have not previously been examined in Australia , and there is limited evidence on the effects of the checklist in the long term. A retrospective review was conducted using administrative databases to examine the effects of the implementation of the checklist on postoperative outcomes. Data from 21,306 surgical procedures , performed over a 5-year time period at a tertiary care centre in Australia where the WHO SSC was introduced in the middle of this period , were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. Postoperative mortality rates decreased from 1.2 to 0.92 % ( p = 0.038 , OR 0.74 ( 0.56-0.98)) , and length of admission decreased from 5.2 to 4.7 days ( p = 0.014). The reduction in mortality rates reached significance at the 2-3 years post-implementation period ( p = 0.017 , OR 0.61 ( 0.41-0.92)). The observed decrease in mortality rates was independent of the surgical procedure duration. Implementation of the WHO SSC was associated with a statistically significant reduction in mortality and length of admission over a 5-year time period. This is the first study demonstrating a reduction in postoperative mortality after the implementation of the checklist in an Australian setting. In this study , a relatively longer period examined , comparative to previous international studies , may have allowed factors like surgical culture change to take effect.
