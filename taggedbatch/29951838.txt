 In this review , we summarize the current understanding of microRNA ( miRNA)- mediated modulation of the gene expression in the fatty liver as well as related signaling pathways. Because of the breadth and diversity of miRNAs , miRNAs may have a very wide variety of biological functions , and much evidence has confirmed that miRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of fatty liver. In the pathophysiological mechanism of fatty liver , miRNAs may be regulated by upstream regulators , and have their own regulatory targets. miRNAs display important roles in the pathological mechanisms of alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. At present , most of the miRNA studies are focused on cell and tissue levels , and in vivo studies will help us elucidate the regulation of miRNAs and help us evaluate the potential of miRNAs as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. Furthermore , there is evidence that miRNAs are involved in the mechanism of natural medicine treatment in fatty liver. Given the important roles of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of fatty liver , we predict that studies of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of fatty liver will contribute to the elucidation of fatty liver pathology and the treatment of fatty liver patients.
