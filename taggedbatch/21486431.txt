 This study aims to assess , in the population of patients with oral cancer treatment , the influence on the quality of life of two protocols of dental treatment: not ruled hospital treatment versus ruled hospital treatment. Matrial and Methods: A quasi-experimental approach justified on ethical grounds was used. A total of 41 patients were included in the control group ( not ruled treatment outpatient health center) and 40 in the experimental group ( ruled hospital treatment). A total of 14 questions to both groups were conducted in three stages: before starting cancer treatment , during treatment and after treatment. the proportions of positive responses in groups and different times were compared using the chi-square test. Based on similar situations during cancer treatment were identified as six issues favorable to the experimental group difference. This number rose to nine after finishing oncological treatment. From our data we can confirm that planned dental treatment performed during the oral cancer treatment produces an improvement in the quality of life in patients with oral cancer.
