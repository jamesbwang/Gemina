 With the rapid development of new mapping and imaging technologies as well as catheter ablation technologies , it is increasingly important to understand the basic concepts of conventional mapping and ablation of cardiac arrhythmias. Prerequisite for successful ablation is the exact identification of the tachycardia<symptom> mechanism and subsequent localization of the origin or tachycardic substrate. Only intracardiac electrograms provide decisive information regarding activation time and signal morphology. In some arrhythmias , it is necessary to supplement conventional mapping with so-called pace and/or entrainment mapping. This article aims to discuss and demonstrate the fundamentals of intracardiac mapping as it relates to the mapping and ablation of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias based on representative clinical cases. Modern three-dimensional mapping methods make it possible to individually optimize established ablation strategies with significantly better spatial resolution. The authors aimed to demonstrate that intracardiac uni- and bipolar electrograms provide essential information about timing and morphology guiding successful catheter ablation. Furthermore , our article provides useful information about conventional cardiac mapping techniques including activation mapping , pace mapping , and individual substrate mapping.
