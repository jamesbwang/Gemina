 Hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV) infection is a major global public health problem and one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease. HBsAg is the first serological marker to appear in the blood and is the most important marker of HBV infection. Detection of HBsAg in serum samples is commonly carried out using an immunoassay such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) , which is complex to perform , time-consuming , and unsatisfactory for testing sensitivity. Therefore , new methods for highly sensitive detection of HBV infection are urgently needed. Aptamers are specific recognition molecules with high affinity and specificity toward their targets. Biosensors that employ aptamers as biorecognition elements are known as aptasensors. In this study , we select an HBsAg-specific aptamer and use it to develop a new chemiluminescent aptasensor based on rapid magnetic separation and double-functionalized gold nanoparticles. This sensor enables rapid magnetic separation and highly sensitive detection of HBsAg in HBV-positive serum. The detection limit of this HBsAg-detecting chemiluminescent aptasensor is as low as 0.05 ng/mL , which is much lower than the 0.5 ng/mL limit of a typical ELISA used in hospitals. Furthermore , this aptasensor works well and is highly specific to HBV infection.
