 The alignment of energy levels within an OLED device is paramount for high efficiency performance. In this study , the emissive , electron transport , and hole transport layers are consecutively evolved under the constraint of fixed electrode potentials. This materials development strategy takes into consideration the full multilayer OLED device , rather than just individual components. In addition to introducing this protocol , an evolutionary method , a genetic algorithm ( GA) , is evaluated in detail to increase its efficiency in searching through a library of 30 million organic compounds. On the basis of the optimization of the variety of GA parameters and selection methods , an exponential ranking selection protocol with a high mutation rate is found to be the preferred method for quickly identifying the top-performing molecules within the large chemical space. This search through OLED materials space shows that the pyridine-based central core with acridine-based fragments are good target host molecules for common electrode materials. Additionally , weak electron-donating groups , such as naphthalene- and xylene-based fragments , appear often in the optimal electron-transport layer materials. Triphenylamine- and acridine-based fragments , due to their strong electron-donating character , were found to be good candidates for the hole-transport layer.
