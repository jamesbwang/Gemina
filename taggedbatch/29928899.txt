 Acrylamide ( ACR) is a water-soluble chemical used widely in industry , which can be formed in tobacco smoke and in starchy foods cooked at high temperatures. ACR is considered to be a neurotoxin , genotoxin and carcinotoxin. Previous studies reported that ACR-exposed workers and experimental animals exhibited visual function defects , although the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. In this study , we found that zebrafish embryos exposed to 1 mM and 2 mM ACR showed significantly increased reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , decreased expression of the antioxidant genes Sod1 , Sod2 , Catalase , Gpx1 and Nrf2 , reduced activity of superoxide dismutase ( SOD) and catalase , and elevated malondialdehyde ( MDA) , compared with control embryos. ACR exposure caused loss of both rod and cone photoreceptor cells through Caspase-3-dependent apoptotis. When embryos were simultaneously exposed to ACR and the natural antioxidative substance carnosic acid ( CA) , the presence of the latter ( 10 Î¼M) markedly counteracted the above ACR-induced toxic effects. Our data suggest that CA can protect photoreceptor cells against ACR-induced oxidative damage and has a potential for neuroprotection of visual function in humans exposed to ACR.
