 Two new polypeptides were isolated and purified from the extract of deer bone ( constitutive part of Cucumis and Cervus polypeptide injection) by various column chromatography including C ₄ 300Å and Sephadex G-50 , as well as semipreparative HPLC. Their N-terminal amino acid sequences were identified by De Novo sequencing on the basis of MALDI-TOF-MS data and Explorer ™ software. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of polypeptides were identified as NH ₂- Gly-Pro-Val-Gly-Pro-Thr-Gly-Pro-Val-Gly-Ala-Ala-Gly-Pro-Ser-Gly-Pro-Asp ( Mei18 peptide , 1) and NH ₂- Ala-Gly-Pro-Ala-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-Pro-Asp-Ser-Try-Asp ( Mei23 peptide , 2) , respectively. Mei18 and Mei 23 peptides are new polypeptides.
