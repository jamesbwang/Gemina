 The generation , maturation and remodelling of the extracellular matrix ( ECM) are essential for the formation of alveoli during lung development. Alveoli formation is disturbed in preterm infants that develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD) , where collagen fibres are malformed , and perturbations to lung ECM structures may underlie BPD pathogenesis. Malformed ECM structures might result from abnormal protein cross-linking , in part attributable to the increased expression and activity of transglutaminase 2 ( TGM2) that have been noted in affected patient lungs , as well as in hyperoxia-based BPD animal models. The objective of the present study was to assess whether TGM2 plays a causal role in normal and aberrant lung alveolarization. Targeted deletion of Tgm2 in C57BL/6J mice increased septal thickness and reduced gas-exchange surface area in otherwise normally developing lungs. During aberrant lung alveolarization that occurred under hyperoxic conditions , collagen structures in Tgm2
