 In the past two decades , super-resolution fluorescence microscopy has undergone a dynamic evolution. Following proof-of-concept studies with stimulated emission depletion ( STED) microscopy , several new approaches such as structured illumination microscopy ( SIM) , photoactivation localization microscopy ( PALM) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM) , have been developed for imaging of nanoscale structural details and fast cellular dynamics in biological research. In this chapter , after briefly explaining their principles , we will describe the recent application of these super-resolution techniques in single cell imaging. In addition , the extension of super-resolution microscopy to 3D , multicolor , live-cell imaging and multimodal imaging are also discussed , significantly improving the precision of single cell imaging. Combining with molecular biology , biochemistry and bio-computing algorithms , super-resolution fluorescence microscopy continues to expand its capabilities and provide comprehensive insights into the details of single cells.
