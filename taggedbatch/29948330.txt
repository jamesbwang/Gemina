 MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are a novel class of diagnostic and therapeutic target in cancer. Here , we aimed to explore the effects and mechanism of miR-195 regulation in colon cancer. The expressions of several putative miRNAs in colon tumors , compared to those in normal tissues , were investigated by bioinformatical analysis of a Gene Expression Omnibus database. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis ( qRT-PCR) was used to validate the identified changes in normal tissues , primary tumors , and metastatic tumors. MTT , soft agar colony formation , and transwell assays were used to evaluate the effects of miR-195 overexpression or inhibition on cell viability , proliferation , migration , and invasion. Targets of miR-195 were identified by TargetScan , and subsequently verified by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The role of miR-195 in the β-catenin pathway was also studied using RT-PCR and Western blot. MiR-195 expression was downregulated in colon carcinoma tissues and negatively correlated with the metastatic potential. While transfecting miR-195 mimics decreased the proliferation , migration , and invasion of colon cancer cells , miR-195 inhibition exerted opposing effects. WNT3A was identified as a direct target of miR-195. β-catenin was also downregulated by miR-195 in colon cancers. MiR-195 downregulation is associated with the enhanced proliferation , migration , and invasion of colon cancer. MiR-195 directly downregulates WNT3A. Our results indicate that miR-195 is a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for improving the clinical management of colon cancer.
