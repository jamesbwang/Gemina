 Neuronal proteostasis is maintained by the dynamic integration of different processes that regulate the synthesis , folding , quality control , and localization of proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) serves as a fundamental pillar of the proteostasis network , and is emerging as a key compartment to sustain normal brain function. The unfolded protein response ( UPR) , the main mechanism that copes with ER stress , plays a central role in the quality control of many ion channels and receptors , in addition to crosstalk with signaling pathways that regulate connectivity , synapse formation , and neuronal plasticity. We provide here an overview of recent advances in the involvement of the UPR in maintaining neuronal proteostasis , and discuss its emerging role in brain development , neuronal physiology , and behavior , as well as the implications for neurodegenerative diseases involving cognitive decline.
