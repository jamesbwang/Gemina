 The aim was to examine guilt and embitterment in mothers and fathers of children with burns and its associations with depression<symptom> and burn severity. Parents ( N = 61 , mothers n = 41 , fathers n = 20) completed self-report questionnaires on guilt and embitterment , 0.8-5.6 years after their child 's burn. Burn severity and socio-demographic variables were obtained from medical records and symptoms of depression<symptom> were assessed with the Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression<symptom> Rating Scale ( MADRS). The parents reported low levels of guilt , embitterment and depression<symptom>. Burn-specific and general guilt were higher in mothers than fathers , but there were no differences in embitterment or symptoms of depression<symptom>. General guilt was associated with depression<symptom> , whereas burn-specific guilt and embitterment were not. Parents with general guilt may suffer from symptoms of depression<symptom>. An implication is that clinicians should address guilt feelings among parents in order to alleviate distress and to identify any need for further counseling.
