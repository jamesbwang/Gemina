 Oxidative stress monitoring in the neonatal period supports early outcome prediction and treatment. Glutathione ( GSH) is the most abundant antioxidant in most cells and tissues , including whole blood , and its usefulness as a biomarker has been known for decades. To date , the available methods for GSH determination require laborious sample processing and the use of sophisticated laboratory equipment. To the best of our knowledge , no tools suitable for point-of-care ( POC) sensing have been reported. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy ( SERS) , performed in a microvolume capillary measurement cell , is proposed in this study as a robust approach for the quantification of GSH in human whole blood samples. The use of a silver colloid allowed a highly selective signal enhancement for GSH providing analytical enhancement factors of 3 to 4 orders of magnitude. A highly accurate determination of GSH in whole blood samples with recoveries ranging from 99 to 107 % and relative standard deviations less than or equal to 18 % were achieved by signal normalization with the intensity of an isotopically labeled internal standard. GSH concentrations were retrieved within 4 min using small-volume blood samples ( 2 Î¼L). The developed procedure was applied to the analysis of blood of 20 healthy adults and 36 newborns , obtaining comparable results between literature and those found by SERS and a reference method. The characteristics of this novel tool are suitable for its implementation in a portable optical sensor device enabling POC testing of oxidative stress levels in newborns.
