 Accurate prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease ( CHD) allows for appropriate delivery and postnatal management. Geographic constraints limit access to fetal cardiology subspecialists. In our approach , general pediatric cardiologists are first line in regional prenatal cardiac screening. We aim to demonstrate the utility of this approach in diagnosing CHD requiring cardiac interventions within 30 days of life. This is a retrospective review of fetal echocardiograms performed at Seattle Children 's Hospital regional cardiology sites ( SCH-RC) from December 2008 to December 2015. Referrals to Seattle Children 's Hospital Prenatal Program ( SCH-PNP) were evaluated for referral timing , indication , diagnostic accuracy , and postnatal care. Diagnostic accuracy was determined using the initial postnatal echocardiogram as the gold standard. Major discrepancy was defined as one resulting in change in surgical management. Of 699 fetuses evaluated at regional sites throughout Washington and Alaska , a small subset ( n = 48; 6.9 %) required referral to SCH-PNP. Need for relocation was confirmed in 31 subjects , of which 27 required cardiac intervention within 30 days of life. Of those not referred to SCH-PNP ( n = 643 , 91.9 %) , none required neonatal cardiac intervention. There were 22 regional diagnostic discrepancies ( 31 % major , 7 % minor). Referral to SCH-PNP improved diagnostic accuracy ( 2 % major , 0 % minor). Regional prenatal cardiac screening demonstrated 100 % sensitivity and 98.9 % specificity for identifying critical CHD. Utilizing regional pediatric cardiologists as first line in prenatal screening in geographically remote regions may improve access to care and outcomes in neonates with critical CHD while improving resource utilization.
