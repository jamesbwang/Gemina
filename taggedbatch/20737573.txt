 Peritoneal carcinomatosis is usually a terminal disease with short median survival in patients with gastric cancer. Systemic FOLFOX is one of the most used regimens in the first-line treatment of metastatic gastric cancer. However , there is scarce evidence that cytoreductive surgery ( CRS) and intraperitoneal heated chemotherapy ( HIPEC) improves oncological outcomes of patients with advanced gastric cancer. Herein we present a case of a young woman with advanced gastric cancer with omental and peritoneal metastases who achieved an excellent response after 6 months of FOLFOX followed by CRS and HIPEC. A 53-year-old woman was diagnosed with advanced gastric carcinoma , with extensive omental caking and several peritoneal implants measuring 2 cm at the largest diameter. The patient received mFOLFOX6 for 6 months with excellent clinical and radiographic response. She was then submitted to a D2 total gastrectomy followed by CRS and HIPEC with mitomycin. The final pathology report showed a focal adenocarcinoma in the stomach measuring 0.4 mm with no residual tumor in the peritoneum ( ypT1ypN0). The patient has been well and disease free for more than 4 years. While still controversial , CRS followed by HIPEC may be a curative therapeutic option for highly selected patients.
