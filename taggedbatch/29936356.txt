 Plants produce a diverse range of peptides and proteins that inhibit the activity of different serine proteases. The value of these inhibitors not only stems from their native role ( s) in planta , but they are also regarded as promising templates for inhibitor engineering. Interest in this field has grown rapidly in recent years , particularly for therapeutic applications. The serine protease mesotrypsin has been implicated in several cancers , but is a challenging target for inhibitor engineering as a number of serine protease inhibitors that typically display broad-range activity show limited activity against mesotrypsin. In this study , we use a cyclic peptide isolated from sunflower seeds , sunflower trypsin inhibitor-1 ( SFTI-1) , as a scaffold for engineering potent mesotrypsin inhibitors. SFTI-1 comprises 14-amino acids and is a potent inhibitor of human cationic trypsin ( K
