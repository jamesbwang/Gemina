 To assess the association between acculturation and body<symptom> weight<symptom> status<symptom> among internal migrant children in China. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1154 pairs of migrant children aged 11-17 years and their primary caregivers in Guangzhou , China , from April to May 2016. Migrant children 's body<symptom> weight<symptom> status<symptom> was measured by body mass index. Acculturation was measured by a questionnaire , developed and validated by the research team. The questionnaire had three dimensions with five factors , namely language , social interaction , custom , dressing and diet. Social anxiety<symptom> was measured by Social Anxiety<symptom> Scale for Children. Food intake was measured by the food frequency table that was developed from a previous study. Logistic regression was performed to examine the association between acculturation and overweight/obesity while controlling for migrant children 's and their caregivers ' demographic characteristics , children 's social anxiety<symptom> and food intake. Seventy-six out of 1154 ( 6.6 %) migrant children were overweight , and 36 ( 3.1 %) were obese. The overall prevalence of overweight/obesity was 12.5 % in boys , and 6.1 % in girls ( p < 0.001) , respectively. The mean scores of acculturation were 41.8 ( SD = 14.6). Migrant children had the highest level of acculturation in the aspect of dressing ( mean = 61.7 , SD The low levels of acculturation was associated with overweight/obesity among migrant children in Guangzhou , China. Promoting healthy acculturation and social campaign on healthy body<symptom> weight may help prevent childhood overweight/obesity. Young migrant children , boys and children living with urban-to-urban migrant caregivers should be the target subgroups.
