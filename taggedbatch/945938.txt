 Guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I ( GCH1) mutations are associated with increased risk for dopa-responsive dystonia ( DRD) and Parkinson 's disease ( PD). Herein , we investigated the frequency of GCH1 mutations and clinical symptoms in patients with clinically diagnosed PD and DRD. We used the Sanger method to screen entire exons in 268 patients with PD and 26 patients with DRD , with the examinations of brain magnetic resonance imaging scans , striatal dopamine transporter scans , and (
