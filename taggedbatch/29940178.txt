 As a kind of superantigen , staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 ( SEC2) is well known as a powerful immunomodulator. However , most previous studies about SEC2 focus on its T cell activating characters. But the direct effect of SEC2 on antigen-presenting cells ( APCs) which are important for the T cell activation is not clearly. In this study , we investigated the effect of SEC2 on murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells ( BMDCs) which are known as the specialized professional APCs. Contrary to its effects on T cells , SEC2 could not induce proliferation or cytotoxicity to BMDCs even in high concentrations. While SEC2 could promote the mature of BMDCs with increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules on cell membrane such as CD80 , CD86 , and MHC II. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α , IFN-γ and IL-6 were also increased in BMDCs treated with SEC2. We also found that SEC2 enhanced the genes expression of pattern recognition receptors including toll-like receptors 2 ( TLR2) and TLR4 in BMDCs , and up-regulated the key signal molecule MyD88 in both mRNA and protein levels. In addition , SEC2 also caused IκBα degradating and NFκB p65 translocating from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in BMDCs. The siRNAs for both TLR2 and TLR4 , as well as NFκB specific inhibitor BAY 11-7085 could inhibit the co-stimulatory molecules expression and pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing induced by SEC2. Moreover , TLR2/4 specific siRNAs inhibited p65 and MyD88 upregulation induced by SEC2. In summary , all our results indicated that SEC2 could stimulate BMDCs maturation through TLR-NFκB signaling pathways.
