 The realization of materials with new optoelectronic properties draws much scientific attention toward the field of nanocrystal superstructures. Low-dimensional superstructures created by interfacial assembly and oriented attachment of PbSe nanocrystals are a striking example because theory showed that PbSe sheets with a honeycomb geometry possess non-trivial flat bands and Dirac cones in the valence and conduction bands. Here , we report on the formation of one-dimensional linear and zigzag structures and two-dimensional ( 2D) square and honeycomb structures for the entire lead chalcogenide family: PbX ( X = S , Se , Te). We observe that PbTe , with a lower bulk melting temperature and enthalpy of formation than those of PbSe , shows a higher nanocrystal surface reactivity , such that the surface must be passivated and the reaction conditions moderated to obtain reasonably ordered superstructures. The present findings constitute a step forward in the realization of a larger family of atomically coherent 2D superstructures with variable IV-VI and II-VI compositions and with electronic properties dictated by the nanogeometry.
