 To evaluate whether combining hypothermia<symptom> and remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC) results in protection from ischemia-reperfusion ( IR). Thirty-two Wistar rats underwent right nephrectomy and were randomly assigned to four experimental protocols on the left kidney: warm ischemia ( group 1) , cold ischemia ( group 2) , RIPC followed by warm ischemia ( group 3) , and RIPC followed by cold ischemia ( group 4). After 240 minutes of reperfusion , histological changes in the left kidney , as well as lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activity , were analyzed. The right kidney was used as the control. Serum creatinine was collected before and after the procedures. RIPC combined with hypothermia<symptom> during IR experiments revealed no differences on interventional groups regarding histological changes ( p = 0.722). Oxidative stress showed no significant variations among the groups. Lower serum creatinine at the end of the procedure was seen in animals exposed to hypothermia<symptom> ( p < 0.001). Combination of RIPC and local hypothermia<symptom> provides no renal protection in IR injury. Hypothermia<symptom> preserves renal function during ischemic events. Furthermore , RIPC followed by warm IR did not show benefits compared to warm IR alone or controls in our experimental protocol.
