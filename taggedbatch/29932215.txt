 JC polyomavirus<pathogen> ( JCPyV) is the causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML) , a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system in immunocompromised patients. Archetype JCPyV circulates in the human population. There have been several reports of archetype JCPyV replication in cultured cells , in which propagation was not enough to produce high titers of archetype JCPyV. In this study , we carried out cultivation of the transfected cells with archetype JCPyV DNA MY for more than 2 months to establish COS-7 cells ( designated COS-JC cells) persistently producing archetype JCPyV. Moreover , JCPyV derived from COS-JC cells was characterized by analyzing the viral propagation , size of the viral genome , amount of viral DNA , production of viral protein , and structure of the non-coding control region ( NCCR). Southern blotting using a digoxigenin-labeled JCPyV probe showed two different sizes of the JCPyV genome in COS-JC cells. For molecular cloning , four of five clones showed a decrease in the size of complete JCPyV genome. Especially , clone No. 10 was generated the large deletion within the Large T antigen. On the other hand , the archetype structure of the NCCR was maintained in COS-JC cells , although a few point mutations occurred. Quantitative PCR analysis of viral DNA in COS-JC cells indicated that a high copy number of archetype JCPyV DNA was replicated in COS-JC cells. These findings suggest that COS-JC cells could efficiently propagate archetype JCPyV MY and offer a useful tool to study persistent infection of archetype JCPyV in a kidney-derived system.
