 To assess Scanning Electron Microscopy in Back-Scattered Emission mode ( BSE-SEM) for measurement of lesion<symptom> mineral content as a function of depth. Direct comparison is made with Transverse Micro-Radiography ( TMR) and Surface Micro-Hardness ( SMH) on carious and erosive lesions<symptom>. Caries<disease> lesions<symptom> prepared from sound bovine enamel at 37 Â°C and pH 4.6 in unsaturated ( 7d) or part-saturated ( 8d , 4.1 mM Ca Cross-sectional BSE-SEM images clearly differentiate between caries<disease> and erosive lesions<symptom>. Comparison of caries<disease> lesion<symptom> mineral loss from BSE-SEM with TMR data showed good correlation ( R BSE-SEM provides a relatively rapid and cost-effective method for the assessment of mineral content in demineralised tooth enamel and is applicable to both caries<disease> and erosive lesions<symptom>.
