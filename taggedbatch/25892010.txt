 Autoantibodies to cytosolic 5 '- nucleotidase 1A ( cN-1A; NT5C1A) have a high specificity when differentiating sporadic inclusion body myositis from polymyositis and dermatomyositis. In primary Sj√∂gren 's syndrome<disease><symptom> ( pSS) and systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) anti-cN-1A autoantibodies can be detected as well. However , various frequencies of anti-cN-1A reactivity have been reported in SLE and pSS , which may at least in part be explained by the different assays used. Here , we determined the occurrence of anti-cN-1A reactivity in a large number of patients with pSS and SLE using one standardized ELISA. Sera from pSS ( Anti-cN-1A autoantibodies were found on average in 12 % of pSS patients , with varying frequencies among the different cohorts ( range: 7-19 %). In SLE patients , the anti-cN-1A positivity on average was 10 % ( range: 6-21 %). No relationship was found between anti-cN-1A reactivity and the presence or absence of anti-Ro52 , anti-nucleosome , and anti-dsDNA reactivity in both pSS and SLE. No relationship between anti-cN-1A reactivity and duration of disease at the moment of serum sampling and the duration of serum storage was observed. The frequency of muscular symptoms or viral<disease> infections<disease> did not differ between anti-cN-1A-positive and- negative patients. In both disease groups anti-cN-1A-positive patients suffered more often from other autoimmune diseases than the anti-cN-1A-negative patients ( 15 versus 5 % ( Our results confirm the relatively frequent occurrence of anti-cN-1A in pSS and SLE patients and the variation in anti-cN-1A reactivity between independent groups of these patients. The explanation for this variation remains elusive. The correlation between anti-cN-1A reactivity and polyautoimmunity should be evaluated in future studies. We conclude that anti-cN-1A should be classified as a myositis-associated- , not as a myositis-specific-autoantibody based on its frequent presence in SLE and pSS.
