 Background Drug-related problems ( DRPs) are common in hospitalized patients with neurological diseases. Clinical pharmacy services could minimize drug-related harm and improve patient care. Objective To identify common DRPs in neurology and document clinical pharmacists ' medication-related interventions. Setting The wards and intensive care unit of the Department of Neurology at Assiut University Hospital. Method Prospective study of clinical pharmacists ' interventions during the routine care work of reviewing patients medical charts over a period of 6 months from January to June 2017. Main outcome measure The frequency and severity of DRPs and clinical pharmacists ' recommendations. Results Out of 1421 reviewed medications charts , a total of 414 DRPs were detected for 285 admitted patients. The most common DRPs were drug selection problems ( 36.7 %) and dosing errors ( 27.5 %). The majority of DRPs ( 71.7 %) were categorized as causing no patient harm. Clinical pharmacists provided recommendations for the detected problems that ranged from drug monitoring to stop and starting new medicines. About 90 % of pharmacists ' interventions were accepted by physicians. Poisson regression of factors that may influence the frequency of DRPs revealed significant associations of patient age ( p = 0.03) and the number of comorbid diseases ( p = 0.01). Conclusions Prescribing errors in neurology inpatient are likely to occur. Clinical pharmacists ' interventions assisted in early detection of drug problems and prevention of the consequent patient harms.
