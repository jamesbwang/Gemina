 Protection of 2,3,4- O-unprotected α-galacto- and α-fucopyranosides with BzCN and DMAP/DIPEA as the base afforded directly and regioselectively the 3- O-unprotected derivatives. The rationale for these studies was to take advantage of the eventual cooperativity of the `` cyanide effect '' and `` the alkoxy group mediated diol effect ''. This way , even the totally unprotected α-galactopyranosides could be regioselectively transformed into the corresponding 2,4,6- O-protected derivatives. The great utility of these building blocks was demonstrated in efficient trisaccharide syntheses.
