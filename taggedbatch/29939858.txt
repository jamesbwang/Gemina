 The term `` storming '' has often been used colloquially to characterize brain injured patients who showed signs and symptoms of elevated heart rate , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , respiratory rate , temperature , and motor posturing. Recently , the term paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity ( PSH) has been used as the unifying term to describe these acute episodes of elevated sympathetic hyperactivity. Various pharmaceutical and management options are available , but no single drug or protocol has been deemed superior to the others. Data on prognosis and recovery in relation to PSH are limited , but point toward poorer functional outcome and increased mortality. Overall , the phenomenon of PSH requires further research to aid rehabilitative efforts so that patients can effectively participate in therapy. A review of the literature has revealed sparse information on the management of sympathetic storming within rehabilitation facilities. This narrative review seeks to provide an up-to-date synopsis and recommendations on the management of rehabilitation inpatients with PSH.
