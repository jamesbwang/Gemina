 To investigate the effects of aerobic exercise and dieting on chemerin and its receptor chemokine like receptor-1 ( CMKLR1) in the livers of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM) rats and its possible roles on the improvements of blood glucose and lipid metabolism. Fifty male SD rats were randomly divided into control group ( Con , Accompanied with the increased serum levels of TC , TG , LDL and FBG in DM rats , the mRNA and protein levels of chemerinand CMKLR1 in the livers of DM rats were significant up-regulated. The serum levels of TC , TG , LDL and FBG were reduced in EDM , NDM and ENDM rats compared with those of DM rats , meanwhile , decreased protein levels of chemerin were found in the livers of EDM , NDM and ENDM rats with most significant in ENDM rats while increased protein levels of CMKLR1 in the livers of NDM and ENDM rats. Four weeks of aerobic exercise with or without dieting decreased chemerin and increased CMKLR1 in the livers of DM rats at the protein levels , which might be attributed to the improvement of blood glucose and lipid metabolism of DM rats.
