 The main reasons for failure of cancer chemotherapy are intrinsic and acquired drug resistance. The Hippo pathway effector Yes-associated protein ( YAP) is associated with resistance to both cytotoxic and molecular targeted drugs. Several lines of evidence indicate that YAP activates transcriptional programmes to promote cell cycle progression and DNA damage responses. Therefore , we hypothesised that YAP is involved in the sensitivity of cancer cells to small-molecule agents targeting cell cycle-related proteins. Here , we report that the inactivation of YAP sensitises the OVCAR-8 ovarian cancer cell line to AZD1775 , a small-molecule WEE1 kinase inhibitor. The accumulation of DNA damage and mitotic failures induced by AZD1775-based therapy were further enhanced by YAP depletion. YAP depletion reduced the expression of the Fanconi anaemia ( FA) pathway components required for DNA repair and their transcriptional regulator E2F1. These results suggest that YAP activates the DNA damage response pathway , exemplified by the FA pathway and E2F1. Furthermore , we aimed to apply this finding to combination chemotherapy against ovarian cancers. The regimen containing dasatinib , which inhibits the nuclear localisation of YAP , improved the response to AZD1775-based therapy in the OVCAR-8 ovarian cancer cell line. We propose that dasatinib acts as a chemosensitiser for a subset of molecular targeted drugs , including AZD1775 , by targeting YAP.
