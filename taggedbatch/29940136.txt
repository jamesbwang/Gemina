 Shared decision-making is widely recommended when men are considering prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen ( PSA). The role of patients ' trust in cancer information from their physician in such decisions is unknown. We identified male respondents â‰¥ 18 years of age from the Health Information National Trends Survey , a population-based survey of people living in the U.S. ( 2011-014). We assessed the association between degree of trust in cancer information from respondent 's physician with patient-reported receipt of PSA-screening and patient-reported discussion of PSA screening with their physician. Among 5069 eligible respondents , 3606 ( 71.1 %) men reported trusting cancer information from their physician `` a lot , '' 1186 ( 23.4 %) `` somewhat , '' 219 ( 4.3 %) `` a little , '' and 58 ( 1.1 %) `` not at all. '' A total of 2655 ( 52.4 %) men reported receiving PSA screening. The degree of trust an individual had in his physician for cancer information was strongly associated with his likelihood of having received PSA screening ( p The level of trust an individual has in cancer information from his physician is strongly associated with his likelihood of discussing and undergoing PSA screening. As rationale , implementation of PSA screening requires shared decision-making , and the level of trust an individual has in his physician has important implications for dissemination of PSA screening guidelines.
