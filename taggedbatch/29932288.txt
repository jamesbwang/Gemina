 Childhood brain tumor diagnoses are stressful for families. Children diagnosed with craniopharyngioma ( Cp) present with particularly challenging medical and cognitive problems due to tumor location and associated biophysiologic comorbidities. This study examined parental distress in a sample of families of patients with Cp treated with proton beam therapy to identify factors for targeting psychological intervention. Prior to ( n = 96) and 1 year after ( n = 73) proton therapy , parents of children diagnosed with Cp ( 9.81 Â± 4.42 years at baseline; 49 % male) completed a self-report measure of distress , the Brief Symptom Inventory ( BSI). Children completed cognitive assessment measures at baseline; medical variables were extracted from the study database. At baseline , t-tests revealed parents reported higher levels of distress than normative expectations on Anxiety<symptom> , Depression<symptom> , Global Severity , and Positive Symptom Distress BSI scales ( P < 0.05). Linear mixed effects models revealed parent report measures of child executive dysfunction and behavioral issues were more predictive of parental distress than patients ' cognitive performance or medical status ( P < 0.05). Models also revealed a significant reduction only in Anxiety<symptom> over time ( t = -2.19 , P < 0.05). Extensive hypothalamic involvement at baseline predicted this reduction ( P < 0.05). Parents experience significant distress before their child begins adjuvant therapy for Cp , though parental distress appears largely unrelated to medical complications and more related to parent perceptions of child cognitive difficulties ( vs. child performance). Importantly , this may be explained by a negative parent reporting style among distressed parents. Knowledge of socio-emotional functioning in parents related to patient characteristics is important for optimization of psychological intervention.
