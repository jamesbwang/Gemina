 Hypercalciuria is the most frequent metabolic disorder encountered in kidney stone formers ( SF). Reduced renal phosphate reabsorption ( i.e. renal phosphate leak) was proposed to be a driver of hypercalciuria in calcium SF. However , the phenotype of SF with renal phosphate leak remains poorly defined and the association of renal phosphate leak with stone history , stone composition and bone mineral density ( BMD) has not been studied. To fill these knowledge gaps , we conducted a cross-sectional analysis in a cohort of 555 idiopathic calcareous SF. The ratio of tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate to glomerular filtration rate ( TmP/GFR) was used to evaluate renal phosphate transport. Multivariable regression analyses revealed a negative association of parathyroid hormone ( PTH) , a positive association of 25-hydroxy vitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D<pathogen>) and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D ( 1,25 ( OH) 2D) but no association of fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23) with TmP/GFR. SF with low TmP/GFR had their first stone event at a younger age and were more likely to have a positive family history of kidney stones. In addition , urinary calcium excretion and prevalence of brushite stones were significantly higher in SF with low TmP/GFR. However , BMD , measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry , was not associated with TmP/GFR in SF. Renal phosphate handling has a strong heritable component in SF and correlates with PTH , 25 ( OH) D<pathogen> and 1,25 ( OH) 2D , but not with FGF23 levels. Furthermore , a low TmP/GFR ( i.e. a renal phosphate leak) is associated with higher urinary calcium excretion and an increased prevalence of brushite stones.
