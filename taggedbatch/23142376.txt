 CHARGE syndrome<disease><symptom> is an autosomal dominant malformation disorder caused by heterozygous loss of function mutations in the chromatin remodeler CHD7 , which has been estimated to occur in 1:10,000 births worldwide. It is a genetic disorder closely resembles other pattern of anomalies. Genetic testing should be pointed out as a useful method for clinical diagnosis. A female infant was the second child born to a 33-year-old , gravida 3 , para 2 mother. The infant was born at 37 + 4 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 2440 g (- 1.1 S.D.). Clinical examination showed atypical CHARGE syndrome<disease><symptom> , with choanal atresia , a heart defect , and sensorineural deafness. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral venous blood sample using molecular biological technique. We used the Illumina TruSigt One sequencing panel on the MiSeq next- generation sequencing ( NGS) platform for mutation screening and found a novel frameshift mutation in chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 ( CHD7; c. 4656dupT). This mutation results in a new reading frame ending in p. ( Ile1553fs). At the first month of age , the patient had a posterior nostril plasty operation by nasal endoscope. At the second month of age , she had patent ductus arteriosus ligation surgery. At the 4th month of age , she was discharged from the hospital. Our findings further reveal that patients should not be rejected for CHD7 mutational analysis even if they do not fulfill CHARGE syndrome<disease><symptom> Verloes criteria.
