 Recent advances in nanomedicine-based theranostic platforms have catalyzed the generation of new theranostic modalities for pathological abnormalities , such as cancer. Mesoporous silica-based nanomedicines , which feature unique physicochemical properties and specific applicability , are extensively explored for numerous oncological applications. Due to the well-defined morphology , specific surface area , and pore volume , mesoporous silica nanoparticle ( MSN)- based theranostic platforms have provided unprecedented opportunities for the development of next-generation cancer nanomedicine. However , current understanding on the underlying mechanisms of how these feasible theranostic platforms interact with exogenous/endogenous triggers and how this unique responsiveness for optimized cancer therapy can be taken advantage of is still preliminary. In this progress report , efforts are made to give a comprehensive overview of the development of MSN-based `` smart '' theranostic platforms , from exogenous physical irradiation-triggered platforms for localized therapy to endogenous biological stimulus-triggered platforms for tumor microenvironment responsiveness. It is highly expected that these elaborately fabricated MSN-based nanoformulations will play an indispensable role in the efficient cancer therapy based on their high therapeutic outcome and reduced side effects.
