 Various trials have been conducted on the management of male pattern hair loss ( MPHL) , but the outcomes often seem to be limited. Adjuvant therapies are urgently needed. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined fractional radiofrequency microneedling ( FRM) and 5 % topical minoxidil in the treatment of male pattern hair loss. In total , 19 Chinese men were enrolled in this randomized , controlled , split-scalp trial. Participants received monotherapy with 5 % topical minoxidil twice daily to one half of the scalp , while on the other half of the scalp the treatment with twice-daily 5 % topical minoxidil was combined with five sessions of FRM at 4-week intervals. Mean hair count and hair thickness , global assessment by the investigators , subject self-assessment and adverse effects were assessed. After 5 months of treatment , mean hair count increased from 44.12 ± 21.58 to 73.14 ± 25.45 on the combined-therapy side and from 46.22 ± 18.77 to 63.21 ± 19.22 on the monotherapy side , while mean hair thickness increased from 53 ± 13 μm to 71 ± 15 μm and from 52 ± 16 μm to 66 ± 14 μm , respectively. Compared with the monotherapy side , the combined-therapy side had a higher degree of improvement in both hair count ( P = 0.01) and hair thickness ( P = 0.02). Combined treatment with fractional radiofrequency microneedle and 5 % topical minoxidil could be an effective and safe treatment option for male pattern hair loss.
