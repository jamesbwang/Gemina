 Pro- and anti-inflammatory effector functions of IgG antibodies ( Abs) depend on their subclass and Fc glycosylation pattern. Accumulation of non-galactosylated ( agalactosylated; G0) IgG Abs in the serum of rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> and systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) patients reflects severity of the diseases. In contrast , sialylated IgG Abs are responsible for anti-inflammatory effects of the intravenous immunoglobulin ( pooled human serum IgG from healthy donors) , administered in high doses ( 2 g/kg) to treat autoimmune patients. However , whether low amounts of sialylated autoantigen-reactive IgG Abs can also inhibit autoimmune diseases is hardly investigated. Here , we explore whether sialylated autoantigen-reactive IgG Abs can inhibit autoimmune pathology in different mouse models. We found that sialylated IgG auto-Abs fail to induce inflammation<symptom> and lupus nephritis in a B cell receptor ( BCR) transgenic lupus model , but instead are associated with lower frequencies of pathogenic Th1 , Th17 and B cell responses. In accordance , the transfer of small amounts of immune complexes containing sialylated IgG Abs was sufficient to attenuate the development of nephritis. We further showed that administration of sialylated collagen type II ( Col<pathogen> II)- specific IgG Abs attenuated the disease symptoms in a model of Col<pathogen> II-induced arthritis<disease><symptom> and reduced pathogenic Th17 cell and autoantigen-specific IgG Ab responses. We conclude that sialylated autoantigen-specific IgG Abs may represent a promising tool for treating pathogenic T and B cell immune responses in autoimmune diseases.
