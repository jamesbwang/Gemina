 This study investigated the occupational health risk factors among nurses who work in public hospital surgical units. Nursing has a significant place in healthcare systems around the world. Surgical units are environments with certain risks , especially because of the possibility of exposure to various chemical , biologic or physical hazards. This study was conducted with 229 nurses who were working in the 11 surgery units of a big university hospital. In this cross-sectional study , a personal information form and an occupational risk factors scale were administered to respondents. We performed factor and reliability analyses for the scale; the overall reliability of the 41 items was Î± = 0.924 , and the factor analysis found the scale was feasible. Biologic and psychological risk factor levels were found to be high. Physical , chemical , ergonomic and radiation risk factor levels were moderate. The general occupational risk factor score was moderate. Nurses working night duty were confronted with physical and psychological risk factors at a higher rate compared with those working in the daytime. Reported occupational health problems by nurses were correlated with the descriptive properties of the nurses including age , sex , marital status , education level , working hours , mode of working and status of occupational health and safety training. Nurses experience different occupational risks. If these risks are identified , healthier working environments can be provided to the nurses by taking necessary precautions. The health care provided by nurses who work in a healthy environment would be more efficient and of better quality , which will result in better economic and social outcomes for individual and communities.
