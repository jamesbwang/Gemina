 A highly sensitive , rapid and rugged liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-ESI-MS/MS) method was developed for reliable estimation of amantadine ( AMD) , an antiviral drug in human plasma. The analyte and internal standard ( IS) , amantadine-d6 ( AMD-d6) , were extracted from 200 µL plasma by solid phase extraction on Phenomenex Strata-X-C 33 µ cartridges. Chromatography was performed on Synergi ™ Hydro-RP C
