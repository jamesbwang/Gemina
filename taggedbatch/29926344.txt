 The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS) is a National Institutes of Health initiative designed to improve patient-reported outcomes using state-of-the-art psychometric methods. The aim of this study is to describe qualitative efforts to identify and refine items from psychological well-being subdomains for future testing , psychometric evaluation , and inclusion within PROMIS. Seventy-two items from eight existing measures of positive affect , life satisfaction , meaning & purpose , and general self-efficacy were reviewed , and 48 new items were identified or written where content was lacking. Cognitive interviews were conducted in patients with cancer ( n = 20; 5 interviews per item) to evaluate comprehensibility , clarity , and response options of candidate items. A Lexile analysis confirmed that all items were written at the sixth grade reading level or below. A majority of patients demonstrated good understanding and logic for all items; however , nine items were identified as `` moderately difficult '' or `` difficult '' to answer. Patients reported a strong preference for confidence versus frequency response options for general self-efficacy items. Altogether , 108 items were sufficiently comprehensible and clear ( 34 positive affect , 10 life satisfaction , 44 meaning & purpose , 20 general self-efficacy). Future research will examine the psychometric properties of the proposed item banks for further refinement and validation as PROMIS measures.
