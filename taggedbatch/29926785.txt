 The clinical impact of central line bundle programs for central line-associated bloodstream infections has been well demonstrated in intensive care units. However , the experience of central line bundle programs in totally implantable venous access devices ( ports) in pediatric-hematology patients was limited. A retrospective study was designed to compare and evaluate the clinical impact of implementing a central line bundle for a 2-year 5-month period , including 10 months of prebundle period , 11 months of central line bundle ( that includes needleless split-septum devices) , and finally 8 months of central line bundle period in which single-use prefilled flushing devices were added to the previous central line bundle. During the prebundle period , the rate of 14.5 central line-associated bloodstream infections per 1000 CL-days had decreased to 5.49 CLABSIs per 1000 CL-days in the first bundle period. The incidence rate ratio with these two groups was 0.379 , indicating a relative risk reduction of 62 % ( p = 0.005). By the addition of single-use prefilled flushing devices to the first bundle program , the central line-associated bloodstream infection rate decreased to 2.63 per 1000 CL-days. Port removal rate due to central line-associated bloodstream infections was 0.46 per 1000 catheter days in the bundle period , which was significantly lower than in the prebundle period in which port removal rate was 4.5 per 1000 catheter days ( p < 0.001). Central line bundle programs were found to be effective in decreasing central line-associated bloodstream infection rates , improving patients ' quality of life by preventing ports removal due in pediatric cancer patients.
