 To study the SSR loci information and develop molecular markers , a total of 43 683 Unigenes in transcriptome of Andrographis paniculata were used to explore SSR. The distribution frequency of SSR and the basic characteristics of repeat motifs were analyzed using MicroSAtellite software , SSR primers were designed by Primer 3.0 software and then validated by PCR. Moreover , the gene function analysis of SSR Unigene was obtained by Blast. The results showed that 14 135 SSR loci were found in the transcriptome of A. paniculata , which distributed in 9 973 Unigenes with a distribution frequency of 32.36 %. Di-nucleotide and Tri-nucleotide repeat were the main types , accounted for 75.54 % of all SSRs. The repeat motifs of AT/AT and CCG/CGG were the predominant repeat types of Di-nucleotide and Tri-nucleotide , respectively. A total of 4 740 pairs of SSR primers with the potential to produce polymorphism were designed for maker development. Ten pairs of primers in 20 pairs of randomly picked primers produced fragments with expected molecular size. The gene function of Unigenes containing SSR were mostly related to the basic metabolism function of A. paniculata. The SSR markers in transcriptome of A. paniculata show rich type , strong specificity and high potential of polymorphism , which will benefit the candidate gene mining and marker-assisted breeding.
