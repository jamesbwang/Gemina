 A systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate the role of diet and food intake in age-related macular degeneration ( AMD). Eighteen high-quality studies were identified. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet had decreased risk of AMD progression. An Oriental diet pattern had decreased association with AMD prevalence , whereas a Western diet pattern had increased association with AMD prevalence. High consumption of vegetables rich in carotenoids and fatty fish containing omega-3 fatty acids was beneficial for those at risk of AMD. Vegetable oils and animal fats containing omega-6 fatty acids , and red/processed meat should be consumed minimally to reduce the risk of AMD progression. High glycaemic index diets and alcohol consumption of greater than two drinks a day had increased association with AMD. As the quality of diet and food intake had a vital role in AMD , the provision of appropriate nutritional advice to those at risk of AMD is recommended.
