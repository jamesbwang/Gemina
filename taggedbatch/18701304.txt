 1,4-Dihydropyridine ( 1,4-DHP) and its derivatives are well-known calcium channel blockers with antiarrhythmic and antihypertensive activities. These compounds exhibit pleiotropic effects including antimicrobial activities that rely on their positive charge and amphipathic nature. Use of magnetic nanoparticles ( MNPs) as carriers of 1,4-DHP modulates their properties and enables improved formulations with higher efficacy and less toxicity. In this study , the antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities of novel 1,4-DHP derivatives in free form and immobilized on MNPs were determined by evaluating pathogen outgrowth and proinflammatory cytokine release in experimental settings that involve incubation of various 1,4-DHPs with clinical isolates of bacteria or fungi<pathogen> as well as mammalian cell culture models. Conventional immobilization of 1,4-DHP on aminosilane-coated MNPs markedly enhances their antimicrobial activity compared to nonimmobilized molecules , in part because of the higher affinity of these nanosystems for bacterial cell wall components in the presence of human body fluids. Optimized nanosystems are characterized by improved biocompatibility and higher anti-inflammatory properties that provide new opportunities for the therapy of infectious<disease> diseases<disease>.
