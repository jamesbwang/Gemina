 Bone is a multifaceted dynamic tissue , involved in mobility , mineral metabolism , and mesenchymal or stromal and hematopoietic progenitor or stem cells breading. Recently , an endocrine role has been attributed to bone due to its ability to produce at least two hormones ( osteocalcin and fibroblast growth factor 23) and to participate directly or indirectly in leptin , insulin , estrogens , and serotonin signaling; regulation; and action. Also , bearing in mind the enormous amounts of substances secreted by the different bone<disease> marrow cell types , it becomes understandable the contribution of bone tissue to systemic homeostasis. Besides , bone is a well-known estrogen-responsive tissue , reacting to environmental influences. Thus , it has been coined as a critical target of environmental xenoestrogens , known as endocrine-disrupting chemicals ( EDCs). The exposure to EDCs results to disruption or imbalance of the systemic hormonal regulation of the skeleton including bone modeling and remodeling , local hormones , and cytokine or chemokine release. The present report highlights the harmful EDCs effects on bone tissue and provides up-to-date information of xenoestrogen action on proliferation , maturation , and homing of bone<disease> marrow inhabitants.
