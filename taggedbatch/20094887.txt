 In the work-up of patients presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome<disease><symptom> ( CIS) , 3T MRI might offer a higher lesion<symptom> detection than 1.5 T , but it remains unclear whether this affects the fulfilment of the diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis ( MS). We recruited 66 patients with CIS within 6 months from symptom onset and 26 healthy controls in 6 MS centers. All participants underwent 1.5 T and 3T brain and spinal<disease> cord MRI at baseline according to local optimized protocols and the MAGNIMS guidelines. Patients who had not converted to MS during follow-up received repeat brain MRI at 3-6 months and 12-15 months. The number of lesions<symptom> per anatomical region was scored by 3 raters in consensus. Criteria for dissemination in space ( DIS) and dissemination in time ( DIT) were determined according to the 2017 revisions of the McDonald criteria. Three-Tesla MRI detected 15 % more T2 brain lesions<symptom> compared to 1.5 T ( Scanning at 3T does not influence the diagnosis of MS according to McDonald diagnostic criteria.
