 Under pathological conditions , such as sickle cell disease and malaria<disease> , heme concentration increases considerably , and it induces membrane damage. As sickled and normal erythrocytes contain high cholesterol: phospholipid ratio , we investigated the role of lipid composition , chain length , and unsaturation on the partitioning and leakage of hemin in phospholipid vesicles. To establish structure-activity relationship in membrane damage , experiments with two other analogues , protoporphyrin-IX and hematoporphyrin ( HP) were also carried out. Hemin and its analogues localize differently in membranes<symptom> and exhibit distinct roles in partitioning , leakage and fusion. Hemin and HP trigger more leakage in the presence of aminophospholipids , whereas cholesterol buffers the destabilizing effect remarkably. Inhibition of fusion by hemin further suggests its unexplored and important role in membrane trafficking , particularly under diseased conditions.
