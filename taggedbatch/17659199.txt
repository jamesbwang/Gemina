 The use of coronary computed tomography angiography ( CCTA) for noninvasive anatomic detection of coronary artery disease is increasing. Recently , fractional flow reserve ( FFR) assessment using routinely acquired CCTA datasets ( FFR This prospective , multicenter , observational trial evaluated changes in coronary atherosclerosis after alogliptin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Fifty-one patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent CCTA examination and having intermediate coronary artery stenosis were treated with 25 mg of alogliptin.
