 The current study was conducted to examine the possible protective and retentive effects of one-week intra-peritoneal ( IP) administration of selenium nanoparticles ( Se-NPs) , compared to its bulk counterpart , selenite sodium ( Ss) , after one complete cycle of spermatogenesis in mature male mice. Thirty adult male mice were divided into 3 groups. Control group was administrated phosphate-buffered saline ( IP) and the other groups received Ss ( 0.50 mg kg-1) and Se-NPs ( 0.50 mg kg-1) for seven successive days. Then , the animals were monitored for 28 days and finally sacrificed and tissue and blood samples were taken. Histopathological features , sperm quality , in vitro fertilization ( IVF) capability and selenium ( Se) content in testicular tissue were analyzed. Antioxidant enzyme activities including catalase , glutathione peroxidase , and superoxide dismutase as well as total antioxidant capacity and malondialdehyde levels were assessed in blood and the tissue samples. Remarkable differences were found in sperm characteristics , histopathological features and oxidative stress biomarkers between control and treatment groups. Moreover , IVF evaluation and tissue Se concentration examination were n't similar for Se-NPs and Ss. Conclusively , Se-treated groups had more antioxidant capacity than the control group , but sperm quality and histopathological features revealed that Se-NPs might possess more antioxidative and retentive potential compared to Ss in one spermatogenesis cycle.
