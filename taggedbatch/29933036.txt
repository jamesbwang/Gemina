 Vortioxetine is a novel antidepressant capable of improving depressive and cognitive symptoms associated with major depressive disorder ( MDD). This study established whether treatment with vortioxetine , fluoxetine or vehicle alters the modulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) under the 21-day chronic unpredictable mild stress ( CUMS) condition in 54 Sprague-Dawley rats. Vortioxetine mitigated the reduction in rearing behavior by CUMS in the OFT on day 7 and 21 , as well as sucrose preference on day 21. Histological examination by H&E staining showed that most hippocampal neurons in the CUMS + FLU and CUMS + VOR groups were intact , although some of them demonstrated karyopyknosis. The mean optical density value of hippocampal BDNF was significantly higher in the CUMS + VOR group than the CUMS and CUMS + FLU groups. There was a trend towards a higher number of hippocampal BDNF-positive cells in the CUMS + VOR group , although it did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion , vortioxetine , but not fluoxetine , increased hippocampal BDNF levels in rats subject to CUMS.
