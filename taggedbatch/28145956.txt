 The 3D anatomical complexity of the foot and ankle and the importance of weight-bearing in diagnosis have required the combination of conventional radiographs and medical CT.Conventional plain radiographs ( XR) have demonstrated substantial limitations such as perspective , rotational and fan distortion , as well as poor reproducibility of radiographic installations. Conventional CT produces high levels of radiation exposure and does not offer weight-bearing capabilities.The literature investigating biometrics based on 2D XR has inherent limitations due to the technology itself and thereby can focus only on whether measurements are reproducible , when the real question is whether the radiographs are.Low dose weight-bearing cone beam CT ( WBCT) combines 3D and weight-bearing as well as ` built in ' reliability validated through industry-standardized processes during production and clinical use ( quality assurance testing). Research is accumulating to validate measurements based on traditional 2D techniques , and new 3D biometrics are being described and tested.Time- and cost-efficient use in medical imaging will require the use of automatic measurements. Merging WBCT and clinical data will offer new perspectives in terms of research with the help of modern data analysis techniques. Cite this article:
