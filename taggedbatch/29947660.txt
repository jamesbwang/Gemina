 Clinical guidelines are traditionally drafted by expert consensus. The benefits of mammographic screening have been questioned in recent years , owing to biases detected in the clinical trials that popularized its widespread use. Meanwhile , growing body of evidence on harms associated with mammographic screening also required a new approach , taking into account the uncertainties on the benefits and a balance<symptom> between the gains and possible harms from screening. This article discusses the development of the new guidelines for early detection of breast cancer in Brazil , with details on the drafting methods and implications for the new recommendations. The new methodology features systematic literature reviews , assessment of the validity of the evidence , and the balance<symptom> between each intervention 's risks and benefits , ensuring greater transparency , reproducibility , and validity in the drafting process. The new guidelines also include recommendations for cases with suspicious signs and symptoms. The authors provide a detailed discussion of the advantages of the approach as compared to the traditional expert consensus model , as well as the methods ' limitations and disadvantages. They also address the implications of various decisions , such as choices on study designs , screening effectiveness outcomes , definition of overdiagnosis , and methods for calculation.
