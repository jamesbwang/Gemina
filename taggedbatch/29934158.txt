 Different approaches to analysing the botanical origin of tannins have been proposed in the last fifteen years , but are generally time consuming and require the use of advanced instrumentation. This study aims to suggest an effective , easy , rapid and cheap method based on the acquisition of FT-IR spectra of 3g/L hydroalcoholic tannin solutions , overcoming possible disadvantages due to sample or particle size inhomogeneity. 114 commercial powder tannins from 7 different botanical sources ( oak , chestnut , gall , quebracho , tea , grape skin and grape seed) were collected and the FT-IR spectra were acquired in the region 926-5011cm
