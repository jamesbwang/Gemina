 The wastewater produced in a pulp and paper industry is one of the most polluted industrial wastewaters , and therefore its treatment requires complex processes. One of the simple and feasible processes in pulp and paper wastewater treatment is coagulation and flocculation. Overusing a chemical coagulant can produce a large volume of sludge and increase costs and health concerns. Therefore , the use of natural and plant-based coagulants has been recently attracted the attention of researchers. One of the advantages of using Ocimum basilicum as a coagulant is a reduction in the amount of chemical coagulant required. In this study , the effect of basil mucilage has been investigated as a plant-based coagulant together with alum for treatment of paper recycling wastewater. Response surface methodology ( RSM) was used to optimize the process of chemical coagulation based on a central composite rotatable design ( CCRD).
