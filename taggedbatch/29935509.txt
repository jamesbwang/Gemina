 A systematic study of the viscosity of the binary Lennard-Jones ( LJ) mixtures is carried out by equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations via the Green-Kubo relation. The effects of mass , size , and energy-parameter asymmetries on the viscosity and the self-diffusion coefficients are examined separately , both in equimolar mixtures and by varying the molar fractions. The systems are mapped into an effective one-component model according to the van der Waals one-fluid ( vdW1) model. Furthermore , using an empirical law for pure LJ liquids , similar to the one proposed recently for liquid sodium , it is shown that the viscosity of the mixtures studied here are well-predicted by the combination of vdW1 fluid and empirical law. The Stokes-Einstein relation in the mixtures has also been investigated. A possible simple extension of this relation , from pure liquids to mixtures , has been proposed and tested.
