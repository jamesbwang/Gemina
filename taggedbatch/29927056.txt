 To identify the genetic basis of severe tooth agenesis in a family of three affected sisters. A family of three sisters with severe tooth agenesis was recruited for whole-exome sequencing to identify potential genetic variation responsible for this penetrant phenotype. The unaffected father was tested for specific mutations using Sanger sequencing. Gene discovery was supplemented with in situ hybridization to localize gene expression during human tooth development. We report a nonsense heterozygous mutation in exon 2 of WNT10A c. 321C > A ( p.Cys107 *) likely to be responsible for the severe tooth agenesis identified in this family through the creation of a premature stop codon , resulting in truncation of the amino acid sequence and therefore loss of protein function. In situ hybridization showed expression of WNT10A in odontogenic epithelium during the early and late stages of human primary tooth development. WNT10A has previously been associated with both syndromic and non-syndromic forms of tooth agenesis , and this report further expands our knowledge of genetic variation underlying non-syndromic forms of this condition. We also demonstrate expression of WNT10A in the epithelial compartment of human tooth germs during development.
