 To study the prevalence of keratoconus ( KC) and the topographical characteristics of the affected corneas<symptom> in patients with refractive errors who were seeking refractive surgery in the Egyptian delta. A retrospective study covering four and half years ( Jan 2012-June 2016) where the topographical data of 8124 participants were obtained from the records of a refractive center in the Nile<pathogen><disease> delta region , Egypt. The diagnosis of KC was based on the Holladay criteria in one or both eyes , using the Pentacam scans , whereas grading of KC was based on the Amsler-Krumeich classification. The prevalence of KC was 1.12 % ( 91/8124 participants) with 95 % confidence interval 0.91-1.3. Of all the affected cases , 5 cases ( 5.5 %) had unilateral , and the other 86 cases ( 94.5 %) had bilateral KC. The affected and unaffected subjects did not show any significant difference regarding gender. Sixty-eight ( 38.4 %) eyes had stage 1 KC , 53 eyes ( 29.9 %) had stage 2 , 27 eyes ( 15.3 %) had stage 3 , and 29 eyes ( 16.4 %) had stage 4 KC. It was most prevalent ( 1.2 %) among cases with astigmatism ( P < 0.001). Keratoconus was found in 1.12 % of patients seeking refractive surgery , with no gender preference. Most cases had bilateral affection. Astigmatism was the most common refractive error to be associated with keratoconus.
