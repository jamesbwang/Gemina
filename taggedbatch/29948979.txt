 Additive manufacturing ( 3D printing) permits the fabrication of tablets in shapes unattainable by powder compaction , and so the effects of geometry on drug release behavior is easily assessed. Here , tablets ( printlets) comprising of paracetamol dispersed in polyethylene glycol were printed using stereolithographic 3D printing. A number of geometric shapes were produced ( cube , disc , pyramid , sphere and torus) with either constant surface area ( SA) or constant surface area/volume ratio ( SA/V). Dissolution testing showed that printlets with constant SA/V ratio released drug at the same rate , while those with constant SA released drug at different rates. A series of tori with increasing SA/V ratio ( from 0.5 to 2.4) were printed , and it was found that dissolution rate increased as the SA/V ratio increased. The data show that printlets can be fabricated in multiple shapes and that dissolution performance can be maintained if the SA/V ratio is constant or that dissolution performance of printlets can be fine-tuned by varying SA/V ratio. The results suggest that 3D printing is therefore a suitable manufacturing method for personalized dosage forms.
