 Facial expressions offer an ecologically valid model for examining individual differences in affective decision-making. They convey an emotional signal from a social agent and provide important predictive information about one 's environment ( presence of potential rewards or threats). Although some expressions provide clear predictive information ( angry , happy) , others ( surprised) are ambiguous in that they predict both positive and negative outcomes. Thus , surprised faces can delineate an individual 's valence bias , or the tendency to interpret ambiguity as positive or negative. Our initial negativity hypothesis suggests that the initial response to ambiguity is negative , and that positivity relies on emotion regulation. We tested this hypothesis by comparing brain activity during explicit emotion regulation ( reappraisal) and freely viewing facial expressions , and measuring the relationship between brain activity and valence bias. Brain regions recruited during reappraisal showed greater activity for surprise in individuals with an increasingly positive valence bias. Additionally , we linked amygdala activity with an initial negativity , revealing a pattern similarity in individuals with negative bias between viewing surprised faces and maintaining negativity. Finally , these individuals failed to show normal habituation to clear negativity. These results support the initial negativity hypothesis , and are consistent with emotion research in both children and adult populations.
