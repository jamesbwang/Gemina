 Bronchoalveolar lavage is a common diagnostic test for dogs with suspected pulmonary disease , however there is no published information on whether this procedure could affect the imaging characteristics of the lungs. Aims of this prospective experimental study were to describe computed tomography ( CT) and radiographic features of the lungs after bronchoalveolar lavage in a sample of healthy dogs. Thoracic CT and radiographic images of eight healthy Beagles were acquired at the following time points: before bronchoalveolar lavage , immediately following bronchoalveolar lavage , and at 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , and 24 h following bronchoalveolar lavage. Lung consolidation or interstitial patterns were seen in CT and radiographic images immediately after the procedure. Radiographic lung patterns resolved within 2 h and CT patterns resolved within 24 h. Resolution of the CT pulmonary patterns in the ventral areas of the lungs was delayed compared to the dorsal areas. Mean CT imaging scores differed over time ( P < 0.001) , while mean radiographic imaging scores did not differ over time. This study suggests that thoracic radiography and CT imaging assessments should precede bronchoalveolar lavage procedures if possible , or be performed at least 24 h afterward.
