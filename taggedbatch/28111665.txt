 Magnetic tunnel junctions ( MTJs) with ferromagnetic electrodes possessing the strong perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy ( PMA) are of great interest as they have a potential for realizing next-generation high-density non-volatile memory and logic chips. To date , it is an urgent and critical issue to continuously promote the PMAs through feasible modifications such as the substitution of ferromagnetic layers as well as the overlayer coating on them. Here , we perform the relativistic first principles calculations of TM | L1
