 The plant wilt pathogen Ralstonia<pathogen> solanacearum thrives in the water-transporting xylem vessels of its host plants. Xylem is a relatively nutrient-poor , high-flow environment but R. solanacearum succeeds there by tuning its own metabolism and altering xylem sap biochemistry. Flow influences many traits that the bacterium<pathogen> requires for pathogenesis. Most notably , a quorum sensing system mediates the pathogen 's major transition from a rapidly dividing early phase that voraciously consumes diverse food sources and avidly adheres to plant surfaces to a slower-growing late phase that can use fewer nutrients but produces virulence factors and disperses effectively. This review discusses recent findings about R. solanacearum pathogenesis in the context of its flowing in planta niche , with emphasis on R. solanacearum metabolism in plants.
