 Lawsonella clevelandensis<pathogen> is a Gram-stain-positive , partially acid-fast , anaerobic , being considered a new species within a new genus in the suborder Corynebacterineae. There are only a few cases reported worldwide. This is a fastidious microorganism , difficult to identify by conventional methods , leading to inappropriate treatments. The authors report a case of a 29-year-old woman with a 3-week evolution of a breast nodule<disease>. There was a family history of breast carcinoma. Samples were collected for histological and microbiological examination. Gram staining revealed Gram-positive filamentous bacilli , acid-fast-positive. The cultural examination revealed a Lawsonella clevelandensis<pathogen> that was confirmed by molecular methods. At the last follow up , the evolution was favorable; the abscess<symptom> was resolved , with no evidence of recurrence. To our knowledge the present case was the first reported in Europe.
