 The variable domain of the heavy chain antibodies ( VHHs) is the smallest ( 15 kDa) intact single domain antigen-binding fragment. VHHs often exhibit sub-nanomolar affinity for their designated targets and therefore are receiving increasing attention in molecular targeting and nanomedicine engineering. We cloned and expressed four non-overlapping anti-HER2 VHHs in a prokaryotic expression system that yielded disulfide-bonded VHHs. Purified VHHs , before and after thiolation , were characterized by Western blot and their functionality against the ecto-domain of HER2 receptor was confirmed by ELISA and flow cytometry. Thiolated VHHs were conjugated to the reactive maleimide-PEG
