 The intake of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA) is known to increase several endogenous substances involved in steroid and inflammation<symptom> pathways. Untargeted metabolomics screening approaches can determine biochemical changes after drug exposure and can reveal new pathways , which might be involved in the pharmacology and toxicology of a drug of abuse. We analyzed plasma samples from a placebo-controlled crossover study of a single intake of MDMA. Plasma samples from a time point before and three time points after the intake of a single dose of 125 mg MDMA were screened for changes of endogenous metabolites. An untargeted metabolomics approach on a high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled to liquid chromatography with two different chromatographic systems ( reversed-phase and hydrophobic interaction liquid chromatography) was applied. Over 10000 features of the human metabolome were detected. Hence , 28 metabolites were identified , which showed significant changes after administration of MDMA compared with placebo. The analysis revealed an upregulation of cortisol and pregnenolone sulfate 4 h after MDMA intake , suggesting increased stress and serotonergic activity. Furthermore , calcitriol levels were decreased after the intake of MDMA. Calcitriol is involved in the upregulation of trophic factors , which have protective effects on brain dopamine neurons. The inflammation<symptom> mediators hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid , dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid , and octadecadienoic acid were found to be upregulated after the intake of MDMA compared with placebo , which suggested a stimulation of inflammation<symptom> pathways.
