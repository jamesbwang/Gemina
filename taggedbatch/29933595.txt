 Concentration-gradient Fe ₂ O ₃/ SiO ₂ aerogels were prepared by placing an MTMS ( methyltrimethoxysilane)- derived SiO ₂ aerogel on an iron gauze with an HCl atmosphere via one-dimensional diffusion , ammonia-atmosphere fixing , supercritical fluid drying and thermal treatment. The energy dispersive spectra show that the Fe/Si molar ratios change gradually from 2.14 % to 18.48 % with a height of 40 mm. Pore-size distribution results show that the average pore size of the sample decreases from 15.8 nm to 3.1 nm after diffusion. This corresponds well with TEM results , indicating a pore-filling effect of the Fe compound. In order to precisely control the gradient , diffusion kinetics are further studied by analyzing the influence of time and position on the concentration of the wet gel. At last , it is found that the diffusion process could be fitted well with the one-dimensional model of Fick & rsquo; s second law , demonstrating the feasibility of the precise design and control of the concentration gradient.
