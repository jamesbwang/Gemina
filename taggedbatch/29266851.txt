 This study aimed to investigate trends and sociodemographic factors underlying weight misperception in adults with overweight and obesity in England. This study used descriptive and logistic regression analyses based on a pooled nationally representative cross-sectional survey , Health Survey for England , for the years 1997 , 1998 , 2002 , 2014 , and 2015 of individuals with BMI â‰¥ 25 ( n = 23,459). The main outcomes were ( 1) weight misperception and ( 2) weight-loss attempts as well as the associations with demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and health status. The proportion of individuals with overweight and obesity misperceiving their weight<symptom> status<symptom> increased over time between 1997 and 2015 ( 37 % to 40 % in men; 17 % to 19 % in women). There were socioeconomic disparities in the misperception of weight<symptom> status<symptom> , with lower-educated individuals from poorer-income households and members of minority ethnic groups being more likely to underestimate their weight. Those underestimating their overweight and obesity status were 85 % less likely to try to lose weight compared with people who accurately identified their weight<symptom> status<symptom>. The upward trend in underassessment of overweight and obesity status in England is possibly a result of the normalization of overweight and obesity. Obesity prevention programs need to consider differential sociodemographic characteristics associated with underassessment of weight<symptom> status<symptom>.
