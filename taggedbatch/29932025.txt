 The current review is intended to highlight recent advances in the search of new and effective modulators of the metalloenzymes Carbonic Anhydrases ( CAs , EC 4.2.1.1) expressed in ( h) humans. CAs reversibly catalyze the CO2 hydration reaction , which is of crucial importance in the regulation of a plethora of fundamental processes at cellular level as well as in complex organisms. The first section of this review will be dedicated to compounds acting as activators of the hCAs ( CAAs) and their promising effects on central nervous system affecting pathologies mainly characterized from memory and learning impairments. The second part will focus on the emerging chemical classes acting as hCA inhibitors ( CAIs) and their potential use for the treatment of diseases.
