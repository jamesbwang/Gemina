 Pneumatically actuated soft robots address many challenges with interfacing with delicate objects , but these actuators/robots are still bulky and require many hours to fabricate , limiting their widespread use. This article reports a novel design and manufacturing method for ultrathin soft robots and actuators ( ∼ 70 μm) using a laser-cutting machine that cuts/welds sheets of thermoplastic polyurethane ( TPU) from a 2D CAD drawing. Using this method , five different soft actuators ( e.g. , bending , rotating , contracting) are designed , fabricated , and characterized with both planar and nonplanar motions. Furthermore , we show how stacking multiple sheets of TPU enables rapid fabrication of multifunctional actuators. Finally , a portable four-arm swimming robot is designed and fabricated without any assembly steps. This rapid fabrication method enables soft robots to go from concept to operational within minutes , and creates a new subclass of soft robots suitable for applications requiring a robot to be ultrathin , lightweight , and/or fit within small volumes.
