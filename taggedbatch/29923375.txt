 To evaluate the application of 43-plex SNP typing system in forensic science. The typing of 43 SNP loci in 123 unrelated Han individuals from East China was detected by MALDI-TOF-MS. The application value of 43-plex SNP typing system was assessed according to the forensic parameters of population genetics. All the 43 SNP loci of 123 individuals showed no significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ï¼ˆ The 43-plex SNP typing system in present study shows a high polymorphism , which can be an effective supplement and verification for traditional STR genetic markers. It also can be used with other commercial kits for the forensic paternity testing and individual identification.
