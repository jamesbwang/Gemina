 Î²-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 ( BACE1) is a major player in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease. Structural and functional fluorescence microscopy offers a powerful approach to learn about the physiology and pathophysiology of this protease. Up to now , however , common labeling techniques require genetic manipulation , use large antibodies , or are not compatible with live cell imaging. Fluorescent small molecules that specifically bind to the protein of interest can overcome these limitations. Herein , we introduce SiR-BACE1 , a conjugate of the BACE1 inhibitor S-39 and SiR647 , as a novel fluorogenic , tag-free , and antibody-free label for BACE1. We present its chemical development , characterize its photophysical and pharmacologic properties , and evaluate its behavior in solution , in overexpression systems , and in native brain tissue. We demonstrate its applicability in confocal , stimulated emission depletion and dynamic single-molecule microscopy. The first functional studies with SiR-BACE1 on the surface mobility of BACE1 revealed a markedly confined diffusion pattern.
