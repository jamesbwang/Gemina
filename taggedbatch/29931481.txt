 Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG) has been validated as a safe and effective treatment for morbid obesity. However , data of the long-term outcome remains lacking. A total of 1759 LSG was performed as primary bariatric procedure from 2005 to 2017 with mean age of 35.2 ± 10.3 years old ( 14-71) , female 69.7 % , mean body mass index ( BMI) 37.9 ± 7.7 kg/m The mean operating time , intraoperative blood , and hospital stay of LSG were 121.5 ± 36.5 min , 40.8 ± 69.7 ml , and 2.8 ± 2.7 days , respectively. The 30-day postoperative major complication occurred in 25 ( 1.4 %) patients. The major complication rate was 15 % at first year and 0 % at the last year. The follow-up rate at 1 , 5 and 10 years were 89.3 % , 52.1 and 64.4 %. At postoperative 1 , 5 , and 10 years , the mean percentage of total weight<symptom> loss<symptom> ( % TWL) and excess weight<symptom> loss<symptom> ( EWL %) of LSG patients were 33.4 , 28.3 , and 26.6 % and 92.2 , 80.1 , and 70.5 % , respectively. The mean BMI became 27 , 26.2 , and 27.1 kg/m Our results showed that primary LSG is a durable primary bariatric procedure with sustained weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and a high resolution of comorbidities at 10 years , but about half the patients had de novo GERD. The need for conversion to RYGB was 16.9 % at 10 years.
