 Hydrogels have promising applications in diverse areas , especially wet environments including tissue engineering , wound<disease><symptom> dressing , biomedical devices , and underwater soft robotics. Despite strong demands in such applications and great progress in irreversible bonding of robust hydrogels to diverse synthetic and biological surfaces , tough hydrogels with fast , strong , and reversible underwater adhesion are still not available. Herein , a strategy to develop hydrogels demonstrating such characteristics by combining macroscale surface engineering and nanoscale dynamic bonds is proposed. Based on this strategy , excellent underwater adhesion performance of tough hydrogels with dynamic ionic and hydrogen bonds , on diverse substrates , including hard glasses , soft hydrogels , and biological tissues is obtained. The proposed strategy can be generalized to develop other soft materials with underwater adhesion.
