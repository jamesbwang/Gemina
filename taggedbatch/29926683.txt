 To investigate the effects of Astragaloside IV ( AST) on diastolic function of rat thoracic aorta rings which was injured by microvesicles derived from hypoxia/reoxygenation ( H/R)- treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs) , and the mechanism of AST. H/R-induced endothelial microvesicles ( H/R-EMVs) were generated from cultured HUVECs Ten AST could effectively ameliorate endotheliumdependent relaxation of rat thoracic aortic rings impaired by H/R-EMVs in a concentration-dependent manner , the mechanism might involve the increase in production of NO , and the protein level of p-eNOS , p-Akt and p-ERK1/ 2.
