 Patient advocacy organizations ( PAOs) have long been regarded as important representatives of patient and caregiver interests in health policy debates. Recently , however , PAOs have attracted increased scrutiny over their financial ties to drug and device companies. In the past year , researchers and policymakers have called for the creation of a `` sunshine law '' requiring mandatory public reporting of industry payments to PAOs. Others have suggested that increased transparency would do little to address , and may even exacerbate , underlying concerns about proindustry bias among industry-funded PAOs. To date , however , the benefits of a sunshine law have not been well articulated , nor have objections to the idea been carefully addressed. In particular , little attention has been paid to clarifying the merits of statutorily mandated disclosure relative to those of increased voluntary disclosure by PAOs. I examine arguments for and against a sunshine law and conclude that the balance<symptom> of reasons supports the enactment of such a law.
