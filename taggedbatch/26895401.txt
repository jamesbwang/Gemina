 Inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias at electrophysiological study ( EPS) has long been suggested as predictive for subsequent arrhythmic events. Nevertheless , the usefulness of EPS in the clinical practice is still unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the predictive power of EPS in primary prevention of ventricular arrhythmias in post-myocardial infarction ( MI) patients with left ventricular dysfunction. MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched to identify studies , which analyzed EPS predictive value in post-MI patients with mean EF < 40 % for the composite arrhythmic endpoint defined by: sudden cardiac death ( SCD) , aborted SCD , ventricular tachycardia<symptom> ( VT) , ventricular fibrillation ( VF) , appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD) interventions. Nine studies , evaluating 3959 patients with 647 arrhythmic events , were included in the meta-analyses. EPS showed a strong predictive power for the arrhythmic endpoint with a pooled odds ratio ( OR) of 4.00 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 2.30-6.96) in the whole set of studies , albeit a high level of heterogeneity among studies. EPS predictive power was higher in studies where VT-inducibility was tested ( OR 6.52; 95 % CI: 2.30-18.44; sensitivity 0.65 , specificity 0.78 , and negative predictive value 0.94) , versus those assessing VT/VF-inducibility ( OR 2.09; 95 % CI: 1.34-3.26). VT-inducibility was predictive even when assessed within one month after MI ( OR 7.85; 95 % CI: 3.67-16.80). Inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias at EPS is a strong predictor of the arrhythmic endpoint in post-MI patients with impaired EF , particularly when VT-inducibility is tested. EPS could help selecting the patients who can mostly benefit from ICD therapy.
