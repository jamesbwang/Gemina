 The transportation accuracy of sealed radioisotope sources influences the therapeutic effect of high-dose-rate ( HDR) brachytherapy. We have developed a pinhole imaging system for tracking an Ir-192 radiation source during HDR brachytherapy treatment. Our system consists of a dual-pinhole collimator , a scintillator , and a charge-coupled device ( CCD) camera. We acquired stereo-shifted images to infer the source position in three dimensions using a dual pinhole collimator with 1.0 mm diameter pinholes. The CCD camera captured consecutive images of scintillation light that corresponds to the source positions every 2 s. The system automatically tracks scintillation light points using template-matching technique and measured the source positions therefrom. By integrating a series of CCD images , we could infer the source dwell time from the pixel values in the integrated image. We investigated the tracking accuracy of our system in monitoring simulated brachytherapy as it would be performed for cervical cancer by using water as a stand-in for human tissue. Ir-192 pellet was moved through a water tank using tandem and ovoid applicators. The CCD camera captured clear images of the scintillation light produced by the underwater Ir-192 source in conditions equivalent to common clinical situations. The differences between the measured and the reference 3D source positions and dwell times were 1.5 ± 0.7 mm and 0.8 ± 0.4 s , respectively. This system has the potential to track in vivo Ir-192 source in real time and may prove a useful tool for quality assurance during HDR brachytherapy treatments in clinical settings.
