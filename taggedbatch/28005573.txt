 Chronic inflammation<symptom> underlies many of the health decrements associated with obesity. Circulating progenitor cells can sense and respond to inflammatory stimuli , increasing the local inflammatory response within tissues. Here we show that 6 weeks of endurance exercise training significantly decreases inflammatory circulating progenitor cells in obese adults. These findings provide novel cellular mechanisms for the beneficial effects of exercise in obese adults. Circulating progenitor cells ( CPCs) and subpopulations are normally found in the bone<disease> marrow , but can migrate to peripheral tissues to participate in local inflammation<symptom> and/or remodelling. The purpose of this study was to compare the CPC response , particularly the inflammatory-primed haematopoietic stem and progenitor ( HSPC) subpopulation , to a 6 week endurance exercise training ( EET) intervention between lean and obese adults.
