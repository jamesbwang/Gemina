 Endothelin-1 ( ET-1) and Nerve Growth Factor ( NGF) are proteins , released from cancer-ridden tissues , which cause spontaneous<symptom> pain<symptom> and hypersensitivity<disease> to noxious stimuli. Here we examined the electrophysiological and behavioral effects of these two agents for evidence of their interactions. Individual small-medium cultured DRG sensory neurons responded to both ET-1 ( 50 nM , n = 6) and NGF ( 100 ng/ml , n = 4) , with increased numbers of action potentials and decreased slow K ( +) currents; pre-exposure to ET-1 potentiated NGF 's actions , but not vice versa. Behaviorally , single intraplantar ( i.pl.) injection of low doses of ET-1 ( 20 pmol) or NGF ( 100 ng) , did not increase hindpaw tactile or thermal sensitivity , but their simultaneous injections sensitized the paw to both modalities. Daily i.pl. injections of low ET-1 doses in male rats caused tactile sensitization after 21 days , and enabled further tactile and thermal sensitization from low dose NGF , in ipsilateral and contralateral hindpaws. Single injections of 100 ng NGF , without changing the paw 's tactile sensitivity by itself , acutely sensitized the ipsilateral paw to subsequent injections of low ET-1. The sensitization from repeated low ET-1 dosing and the cross-sensitization between NGF and ET-1 were both significantly greater in female than in male rats. These findings reveal a synergistic interaction between cutaneously administered low doses of NGF and ET-1 , which could contribute to cancer-related pain.
