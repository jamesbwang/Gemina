 To detect marine Bdellovibrio and like organisms ( BALOs) able to infect V.parahaemolyticus from seawater of the Adriatic , Italy. To test , prey specificity and predation efficiency of our Halobacteriovorax isolate , named HBXCO1 , towards 17 Vibrio and 7 non-Vibrio strains linked to the Adriatic sea , Italy. Double layer agar plating technique was used to enumerate BALOs and to evaluate their prey specificity and predation efficiency. Transmission electron microscopy and 16S rRNA analysis were used to identify them. Means of BALOs counts ranged from 5.0 PFU/ml ( March 2017) to 98.6 PFU/ml ( August 2016). HBXCO1 had the ability to attack all tested prey strains of V.<pathogen> parahaemolyticus<pathogen> , V.<pathogen> cholerae<pathogen><disease> nonO1/O139 and V.<pathogen> vulnificus<pathogen> , but it did not prey on non-Vibrio strains and V.<pathogen> alginolyticus<pathogen> under the tested conditions. BALOs capable of infecting pathogenic vibrios are naturally present in seawater of the Adriatic , Italy. Isolate HBXCO1 shows prey specificity preferentially for the Vibrio<pathogen> genus and high predatory efficiency towards a wide range of pathogenic strains. The public impact of V.parahaemolyticus , non O1/O139 V.cholerae and V.vulnificus in bivalves is relevant and current decontamination processes are not always effective. We believe that the predator HBXCO1 represents a potential candidate for the development of strategies of biocontrol of pathogenic vibrios in bivalves from harvesting to trade.
