 To compare dynamic magnetic resonance imaging ( dMRI) defecography phase findings with physical examination ( PE) grading in the evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse ( POP). We retrospectively reviewed 274 consecutive patients who underwent dMRI with defecography. Baden-Walker ( B-W) grading of POP , absolute dMRI values , and grading by dMRI were collected for anterior , apical , and posterior compartments. Anatomically significant POP on PE was defined as B-W Grade ≥ 3 and on dMRI by dMRI Grade ≥ 2. A Spearman 's Rank correlation was performed between absolute dMRI values and respective POP grades. 178 female patients were included. Anatomically insignificant and significant cystoceles had a 26.4 % ( 19/72) and 84.6 % ( 66/78) agreement respectively. Anatomically insignificant and significant apical prolapse had a 2.0 % ( 2/100) and 62.9 % ( 17/27) agreement respectively. Anatomically insignificant and significant posterior prolapse had a 49.5 % ( 51/103) and 78.7 % ( 59/75) agreement respectively. PE detected only 30 % ( 9/30) of total dMRI detected enteroceles and misdiagnosed 10 % ( 3/30) of these patients with a rectocele. The dMRI defecography phase correlated well for anatomically significant prolapse in anterior and posterior compartments. dMRI was superior to PE for enterocele detection and was better able to distinguish an enterocele from a rectocele. Thus , dMRI may have the greatest diagnostic value in cases where the presence of an enterocele is unclear in apical and/or posterior compartments.
