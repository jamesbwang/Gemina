 Surgical resection ± chemotherapy ± radiation or stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT) are established treatment modalities for resectable stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) , and concurrent chemotherapy with radiation is the therapy of choice for unresectable locally advanced disease. Despite treatment with curative intent , most patients subsequently relapse and develop distant disease. Treatment with checkpoint inhibitors represents a major advancement in the treatment of metastatic NSCLC. Therapy against programed cell death-1/ programmed cell death ligand 1 ( PD-1/ PD-L1) is associated with a significant improvement in overall survival in stage IV disease , and these results have led to a great interest in evaluating these agents in earlier-stage NSCLC. The preliminary data from ongoing trials suggest that the integration of checkpoint blockage into the treatment of early-stage and locally advanced NSCLC is safe , tolerable , and has the potential to improve outcomes without adding substantial toxicity. In the current review , we provide an overview of the emerging data on the role of PD-1/ PD-L1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ( CTLA-4) inhibitors in the treatment of early-stage and locally advanced NSCLC , with a focus on ongoing clinical trials and combination strategies.
