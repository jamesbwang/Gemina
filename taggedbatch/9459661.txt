 Mid- to high-latitude peatlands are a major terrestrial carbon stock but become carbon sources during droughts , which are increasingly frequent as a result of climate warming. A critical question within this context is the sensitivity to drought of peatland microbial food webs. Microbiota drive key ecological and biogeochemical processes , but their response to drought is likely to impact these processes. Peatland food webs have , however , been little studied , especially the response of microbial predators. We studied the response of microbial predators ( testate amoebae , ciliates , rotifers , and nematodes) living in
