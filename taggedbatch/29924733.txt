 Delayed discharge reduces hospital efficiency and inconveniences patients. Most hospitals discharge in the afternoon , whereas the most common admission time is mid-morning. Consequently , new patients wait for the beds of patients who are fit to be discharged. Earlier discharge may , therefore , improve patient flow. We investigated the impact of early phlebotomy with early availability of laboratory results on patient discharge rates and discharge time. Discharge rates , discharge time and sample turnaround time were assessed before ( 1 October 2014 to 31 December 2014) and after ( 1 October 2015 to 31 December 2015) introduction of earlier phlebotomy with availability of laboratory results prior to the ward rounds on two surgical wards. Following the intervention , over 95 % of results were available before 8:30 am in 2015 as compared to less than 1 % in 2014. Specimen turnaround times were similar in both study periods. Even after adjustment for age , gender , admission type and length of admission , the same day discharge rate was higher in 2015 compared to 2014 ( 60 % vs. 52 %; p < 0.002) , but time of discharge was unchanged. Early availability of blood results prior to ward rounds increased ward discharges but did not affect discharge time.
