 Stainless steel crown ( SSC) is the most reliable restoration for primary teeth with extensive caries<disease>. Retention is of great importance for a successful restoration and is provided by various factors such as luting cements. The aim of this study was to evaluate the retentive strength of SSC cemented with four different luting cements. In this The results of the study showed that the specimens cemented with zinc phosphate exhibited higher retentive strength as compared to glass ionomer and polycarboxylate ( Zinc phosphate cement showed the most promising results; thus , it can be preferably used for cementation of the teeth with no grossly broken down crowns.
