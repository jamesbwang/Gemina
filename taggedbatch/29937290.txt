 We have previously shown that arteriovenous fistulas<disease> ( AVFs) are more expensive to create and to maintain than arteriovenous grafts ( AVGs) in patients undergoing their first access. Because those for whom this first access fails may be a more disadvantaged group , we hypothesized that the cost of a second access may be different from that in the primary access group. With this in mind , we compared access costs in patients receiving a secondary AVF or AVG after their initial AVF failed to mature. This was a retrospective cohort study of 92 patients who received a second vascular access ( 44 AVFs and 48 AVGs) after their first AVF failed to mature. We quantified the yearly frequency of percutaneous or surgical access interventions and catheter-related bacteremias ( CRBs) using a computerized vascular access database. The costs associated with access procedures were quantified using the outpatient prospective payment schedule , and those related to hospitalization for CRB were determined from the diagnosis-related groups fee schedule. Patients receiving an AVF had fewer percutaneous procedures than those receiving an AVG ( 2.09 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.86-2.34) vs 2.61 ( 2.35-2.88); P = .004) , tended to undergo surgical interventions more frequently ( 1.21 ( 1.04-1.40) vs 1.00 ( 0.84-1.17); P = .08) , and experienced a similar yearly frequency of CRB hospitalizations ( 0.40 ( 0.31-0.52 vs 0.28 ( 0.20-0.38); P = .07). Patients with a secondary AVF vs an AVG had a similar median yearly cost of percutaneous access interventions ( $ 3567 ( interquartile range , $ 1219- $ 4680) vs $ 4989 ( $ 1570- $ 9752); P = .14) and surgical access procedures ( $ 6403 ( $ 3494- $ 13,127) vs $ 4728 ( $ 2563- $ 12,254); P = .38) but a higher annual cost for CRBs ( $ 3405 ( $ 0- $ 12,825) vs $ 0 ( $ 0- $ 5477); P = .04). The total yearly access-related cost was similar in both groups ( $ 19,477 ( $ 9162- $ 36,916) vs $ 18,285 ( $ 6850- $ 31,768); P = .56). Patients undergoing a secondary AVF required more surgical procedures and sustained more bacteremia complications than patients undergoing a secondary AVG implantation. There was no significant difference in the total cost of access care for hemodialysis patients receiving a secondary AVF vs AVG.
