 Hyperglycemia is frequent in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) and is associated with adverse outcome. Aim of our study was to evaluate the correlation between admission plasma glucose level ( PGL) and coronary arteries flow velocity. We enrolled 149 STEMI patients successfully treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( pPCI). The study population was divided into two groups based on PGL ( < or > 140 mg/dl) and on history of diabetes , and the groups compared in terms of corrected TIMI frame count ( cTFC). Hyperglycemic patients had a significantly higher cTFC in both the culprit ( p < 0.0001) and non-culprit vessel ( p: 0.0002); diabetes history impairs as well cTFC of the culprit ( p < 0.0001) and non-culprit vessel ( p: 0.0001). Within the subpopulation of diabetic patients hyperglycemic ones showed higher cTFC in both the culprit ( p 0.0013) and non-culprit vessel ( p: 0.0006). Moreover in the whole population cTFC values of both arteries increase linearly with the increment of admission PGL. Admission PGL affects coronary flow of both culprit and non-culprit vessel. The impairment of coronary flow is also demonstrated in known diabetic patients , suggesting to consider hyperglycemia an additional risk factor. We finally demonstrated for the first time a positive linear relationship between PGL and cTFC.
