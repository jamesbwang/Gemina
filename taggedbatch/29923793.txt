 Maternal exposure to dietary factors during pregnancy may modulate the immunity of offspring by epigenetic programming. But the relationship between intrauterine environment and persistence of protective antibody after hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> vaccination has not been reported. This study was to investigate the 5-year persistence of protective antibody response after primary hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> vaccination , and its relationship with maternal folic acid supplementation. A total of 1461 children who completed a 3-dose 10 μg recombinant hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> vaccine at birth and did not infect hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> were followed up. Logistic regression and mediation analysis was used to explore the relationship between 5-year persistence of protective antibody and maternal nutrition. Of 1403 children who did not revaccinated during the follow-up , 76.1 % had protective hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> surface antibody ( anti-HBs) levels. Twenty percent of mothers did not take folate during pregnancy. Mediation analysis showed a total effect of folic acid supplementation on good persistence ( odds ratio: 1.10 , 95 % CI: 1.03-1.17 , p = 0.0010) , a direct effect was 1.07 ( 95 % CI: 1.01-1.13 , p = 0.0128) and an indirect effect was 1.03 ( 95 % CI: 1.00-1.06 , p = 0.0672); the proportion of good persistence mediated by primary response was 30.3 %. This study indicated a good protective anti-HBs persistence at year 5 after 10 μg recombination hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> vaccination in infants. Maternal folic acid supplementation may improve the persistence of protective antibodies through other pathways. Multi-center cohort studies should be conducted to verify this conclusion.
