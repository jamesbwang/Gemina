 Infectious<disease> diseases<disease> are the second leading cause of death worldwide , suggesting that there is still a need for the development of new and improved strategies for combating pathogens effectively. Streptococcus<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> is the most virulent bacteria causing pneumonia<disease> with high mortality , especially in children and the elderly. Because of the emergence of antibiotic resistance in S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , employing a serotype-independent mucosal vaccine would be the best approach to prevent and treat the diseases caused by S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen>. In this study , we have developed a pneumococcal nasal vaccine , consisting of pneumococcal surface protein A ( PspA) and cationic liposomes composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane ( DOTAP) and cholesteryl 3Î²-N- ( dimethylaminoethyl)- carbamate ( DC-chol) ( DOTAP/DC-chol liposome). The efficiency of this cationic liposome-based PspA nasal vaccine was examined in a murine model of S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> infection. Intranasal vaccination with PspA and DOTAP/DC-chol liposomes conferred protective immunity against lethal inhalation of S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , improving the survival rate of infected mice. Moreover , intranasal immunization with PspA and DOTAP/DC-chol liposomes not only induced the production of PspA-specific IgA and IgG by both mucosal and systemic compartments but also elicited PspA-specific Th17 responses , which play a pivotal role in controlling S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> infection by host innate immune response. We further demonstrated that DOTAP/DC-chol liposomes enhanced PspA uptake by nasal dendritic cells ( DCs) , which might be a mechanism for the induction of protective immune responses to S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> infection. These results show that DOTAP/DC-chol liposome would be an efficient mucosal vaccine system for a serotype-independent universal nasal vaccine against pneumococcal infection.
