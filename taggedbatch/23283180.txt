 Human intestinal organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells have tremendous potential to elucidate the intestinal epithelium 's role in health and disease , but it is difficult to directly assay these complex structures. This study sought to make this technology more amenable for study by obtaining epithelial cells from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human intestinal organoids and incorporating them into small microengineered Chips. We then investigated if these cells within the Chip were polarized , had the 4 major intestinal epithelial subtypes , and were biologically responsive to exogenous stimuli. Epithelial cells were positively selected from human intestinal organoids and were incorporated into the Chip. The effect of continuous media flow was examined. Immunocytochemistry and The optimal cell seeding density and flow rate were established. The continuous administration of flow resulted in the formation of polarized intestinal folds that contained Paneth cells , goblet cells , enterocytes , and enteroendocrine cells along with transit-amplifying and We demonstrate that the Intestine-Chip is polarized , contains all the intestinal epithelial subtypes , and is biologically responsive to exogenous stimuli. This represents a more amenable platform to use organoid technology and will be highly applicable to personalized medicine and a wide range of gastrointestinal conditions.
