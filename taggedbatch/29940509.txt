 The aim of this study was to investigate this involvement in not inflammatory model of pain and which opioid receptor subtype mediates noradrenaline-induced peripheral antinociception. NA is involved in the intrinsic control of pain-inducing pro-nociceptive effects in the primary afferent nociceptors. However , inflammation<symptom> can induce various plastic changes in the central and peripheral noradrenergic system that , upon interaction with the immune system , may contribute , in part , to peripheral antinociception. Hyperalgesia was induced by intraplantar injection of prostaglandin E Intraplantar injection of NA induced peripheral antinociception against hyperalgesia induced by PGE Besides the Î±
