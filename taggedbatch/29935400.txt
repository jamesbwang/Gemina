 Phosphorus recovery from industrialized poultry operations is necessary to ensure sustainable waste management and resource consumption. To realize these goals , an innovative , two-stage process chemistry has been developed to extract nutrients from poultry litter and recover value-added products. Over 75 % phosphorus extraction was achieved by bubbling carbon dioxide into poultry litter slurries and adding strong acid to reach pH 4.5-5.5. After separating the nutrient-deficient poultry litter solids and the nutrient-rich liquid , the extract pH was increased through aeration and strong base addition. Over 95 % of the extracted phosphorus was recovered as solid precipitate at pH 8.5-9.0. High-purity struvite and potassium struvite products were selectively recovered through pH control , introduction of a calcium-complexing agent , and addition of magnesium chloride. The nitrogen-to-phosphorus-to-potassium ( NPK) ratio of the recovered solids was controlled through aeration and pH adjustment. Precipitation at pH 8.5-9.0 and 10.5-11.0 resulted in NPK ratios of 2.0:1.0:0.1 and 0.9:1.0:0.2 , respectively. The process effluent was effectively recycled as makeup water for the subsequent batch of poultry litter , thereby decreasing water consumption and increasing overall nutrient recovery. Sequencing batch operation yielded greater than 70 % phosphorus recovery within a 45-min process , demonstrating the potential for this technology to alleviate nutrient pollution in agricultural settings and generate an alternative supply of phosphorus fertilizers.
