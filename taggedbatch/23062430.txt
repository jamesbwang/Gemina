 Nitrate is required to maintain the growth and metabolism of plant and animals. Nevertheless , in excess amount such as polluted water , its concentration can be harmful to living organisms such as microalgae. Recently , studies on microalgae response towards nutrient fluctuation are usually limited to lipid accumulation for the production of biofuels , disregarding the other potential of microalgae to be used in wastewater treatments and as source of important metabolites. Our study therefore captures the need to investigate overall metabolite changes via NMR spectroscopy approach coupled with multivariate data to understand the complex molecular process under high ( 4X) and low ( 1/4X) concentrations of nitrate ( ( Formula: see text)). NMR spectra with the aid of chemometric analysis revealed contrasting metabolites makeup under abundance and limited nitrate treatment. By using NMR technique , 43 types of metabolites and 8 types of fatty acid chains were detected. Nevertheless , only 20 key changes were observed and 16 were down regulated in limited nitrate condition. This paper has demonstrated the feasibility of NMR-based metabolomics approach to study the physiological impact of changing environment such as pollution to the implications for growth and productivity of microalgae population.
