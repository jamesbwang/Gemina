 The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of gender on health-related quality of life ( HRQOL) using a generic ( Short Form-36 ( SF-36)) and region-specific ( Foot and Ankle Ability Measure ( FAAM)) health measurement tool among a matched cohort of male and female patients with diabetes-related foot complications. The HRQOL of 240 patients with diabetic foot<disease> disease<disease> was measured using the SF-36 and the FAAM surveys. A total of 120 male patients were matched with 120 female patients with the same primary diagnosis , age , type , and duration of diabetes and insulin use. The SF-36 physical component summary ( PCS) and mental component summary ( MCS) scores were calculated using orthogonal and oblique rotation methods. The median age of the respondents was 54 years ( interquartile range = 46-61). No differences in patient characteristics were found between genders. Among the SF-36 subscales , women reported significantly worse physical function ( P = .014) and bodily pain ( P = .021) scores with a trending decrease in general health score ( P = .067). Subsequently , women had worse orthogonal ( P = .009) and oblique PCS scores ( P = .036) than men. However , orthogonal ( P = .427) or oblique ( P = .140) MCS scores did not differ between groups. No significant differences in FAAM scores with respect to gender were appreciated. Our findings suggest that in patients with diabetic foot<disease> disease<disease> , women tend to report lower physical HRQOL compared with men. In efforts to increase compliance , providers should recognize the impact of gender on patients ' perceptions of foot-related complications of diabetes. This knowledge may improve outcomes by adapting more individualized and gender-specific approaches to patients.
