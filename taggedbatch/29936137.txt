 Accumulating evidence points to a significant role of the circadian clock in the regulation of splicing in various organisms , including mammals. Both dysregulated circadian rhythms and aberrant pre-mRNA splicing are frequently implicated in human<disease> disease<disease> , in particular in cancer. To investigate the role of the circadian clock in the regulation of splicing in a cancer progression context at the systems-level , we conducted a genome-wide analysis and compared the rhythmic transcriptional profiles of colon carcinoma cell lines SW480 and SW620 , derived from primary and metastatic sites of the same patient , respectively. We identified spliceosome components and splicing factors with cell-specific circadian expression patterns including SRSF1 , HNRNPLL , ESRP1 , and RBM 8A , as well as altered alternative splicing events and circadian alternative splicing patterns of output genes ( e.g. , VEGFA , NCAM1 , FGFR2 , CD44) in our cellular model. Our data reveals a remarkable interplay between the circadian clock and pre-mRNA splicing with putative consequences in tumor progression and metastasis.
