 It is well known that muscular force production is history-dependent , which results in enhanced ( RFE) and depressed ( RFD) steady-state forces after stretching and shortening , respectively. However , it remains unclear if force-enhancing mechanisms can contribute to increased performance during in vivo stretch-shortening cycles ( SSCs) of human locomotor muscles. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether RFE-related mechanisms contribute to enhanced force and power output during SSCs of the human plantar flexor muscles. Net ankle torques of fourteen participants were measured during and after pure isometric , pure stretch , pure shortening , and SSC contractions when the triceps surae muscles were electrically stimulated at a submaximal level that resulted in 30 % of their maximum isometric torque. Dynamic contractions were performed over an amplitude of 15 째 , from 5 째 plantar flexion to 10 째 dorsiflexion , at a speed of 120 째 s
