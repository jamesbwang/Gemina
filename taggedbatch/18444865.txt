 Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing worldwide concern , which poses unique challenges for the effective prevention and treatment of several infections , especially the ones triggered by organisms producing extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases ( ESBL). Here , we present the surveillance results of the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends ( SMART) of Gram-negative bacilli isolated from intra-abdominal infections ( IAI , n = 1,235) and urinary-tract infections ( UTI , n = 2,682) , collected in Mexico from 2009 to 2015. Susceptibility and ESBL status were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI) broth microdilution method. Both E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( 57 %) and K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( 12 %) were the most frequently reported organisms , as well as the ones with the highest prevalence of ESBL-producing isolates ( 54 % and 39 % , respectively). The overall prevalence of ESBL-producing organisms was higher in nosocomial infections than in community-acquired infections ( 21 % vs. 27 %). The ESBL rates were 36 % for IAI ( 953/2 ,682) and 37 % for UTI ( 461/1 ,235). In addition , ertapenem , imipenem and amikacin were the antibiotics that mostly preserved bacterial susceptibility. Our results show consistency with global trends , although higher than the rates observed in Latin America.
