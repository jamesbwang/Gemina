 This study aimed to identify characteristics that can differentiate between pure mucinous breast carcinomas ( PMBCs) and fibroadenomas ( FAs) with strong high-signal intensity on T2-weighted images ( T2-SHi) from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI). The DCE-MRI tumor characteristics were compared and analyzed between 35 PMBCs and 70 FAs with T2-SHi. Multivariate analysis revealed that delayed enhancement pattern was the only significant independent predictor ( p = 0.007). A delayed enhancement pattern is the most reliable characteristic for differentiating PMBCs from FAs with T2-SHi from DCE-MRI.
