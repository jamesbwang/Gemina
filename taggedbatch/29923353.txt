 We summarize the results of a recent interagency assessment of land carbon dynamics in Alaska , in which carbon dynamics were estimated for all major terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems for the historical period ( 1950-2009) and a projection period ( 2010-2099). Between 1950 and 2009 , upland and wetland ( i.e. , terrestrial) ecosystems of the state gained 0.4 Tg C/yr ( 0.1 % of net primary production , NPP) , resulting in a cumulative greenhouse gas radiative forcing of 1.68 Ã— 10
