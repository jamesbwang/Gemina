 3D bioprinting is emerging as a promising technology for fabricating complex tissue constructs with tailored biological components and mechanical properties. Recent advances have enabled scientists to precisely position materials and cells to build functional tissue models for in vitro drug screening and disease modeling. This review presents state-of-the-art 3D bioprinting techniques and discusses the choice of cell source and biomaterials for building functional tissue models that can be used for personalized drug screening and disease modeling. In particular , we focus on 3D-bioprinted liver models , cardiac tissues , vascularized constructs , and cancer models for their promising applications in medical research , drug discovery , toxicology , and other pre-clinical studies.
