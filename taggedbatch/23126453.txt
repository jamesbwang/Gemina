 With the booming development of evacuation simulation software , developing an extensive database in indoor scenarios for evacuation models is imperative. In this paper , we conduct a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the collected videotapes and aim to provide a complete and unitary database of pedestrians ' earthquake emergency response behaviors in indoor scenarios , including human-environment interactions. Using the qualitative analysis method , we extract keyword groups and keywords that code the response modes of pedestrians and construct a general decision flowchart using chronological organization. Using the quantitative analysis method , we analyze data on the delay time , evacuation speed , evacuation route and emergency exit choices. Furthermore , we study the effect of classroom layout on emergency evacuation. The database for indoor scenarios provides reliable input parameters and allows the construction of real and effective constraints for use in software and mathematical models. The database can also be used to validate the accuracy of evacuation models.
