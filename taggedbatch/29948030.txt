 Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD) , a leading cause of death globally , has origins in childhood. Major risk factors include family history of premature CVD , dyslipidemia , diabetes mellitus , and hypertension. Lipoprotein ( a) ( Lp ( a)) , an inherited lipoprotein , is associated with premature CVD , but its impact on cardiovascular health during childhood is less understood. The objective of the study was to examine the relationship between Lp ( a) , family history of premature CVD , dyslipidemia , and vascular function and structure in a high-risk pediatric population. This is a single-center , cross-sectional study of 257 children referred to a preventive cardiology clinic. The independent variable , Lp ( a) , separated children into high-Lp ( a) ( Lp ( a) â‰¥ 30 mg/dL) and normal-Lp ( a) groups ( Lp ( a) < 30 mg/dL). Dependent variables included family history of premature CVD; dyslipidemia , defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol > 130 mg/dL , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) < 45 mg/dL , triglycerides ( TG) > 100 mg/dL; and vascular changes suggesting early atherosclerosis , as measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity ( PWV) and carotid artery intima-media thickness ( CIMT). Of the 257 children , 110 ( 42.8 %) had high Lp ( a) and 147 ( 57.2 %) had normal Lp ( a). There was a higher prevalence of African-American children in the high-Lp ( a) group ( 19.3 %) compared to the normal-Lp ( a) group ( 2.1 %) ( p < 0.001). High Lp ( a) was associated with positive family history of premature CVD ( p = 0.03) , higher-than-optimal HDL-C ( p = 0.02) , and lower TG ( p < 0.001). There was no difference in PWV or CIMT between groups. High Lp ( a) in children is associated with family history of premature CVD and is prevalent in African-American children. In children with high Lp ( a) , promotion of intensive lifestyle modifications is prudent to decrease premature CVD-related morbidity.
