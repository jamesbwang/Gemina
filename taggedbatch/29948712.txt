 Preventing food wastage is a key element of sustainable resource management. But as food waste is still generated at high volumes , priority is placed on its proper management as a resource , maximising sustainability benefits. This study , by integrating a multi-criteria decision analysis with a sustainability assessment approach , develops a screening and decision support framework for comparing the sustainability performance of food waste management options. A structured process for selecting criteria based on the consideration of environmental , economic and social aspects related to region-specific food waste system planning , policy and management has been developed. Two food waste management options , namely the use of food waste disposal units , which grind food waste at the household 's kitchen sink and discharge it to the sewer , and the anaerobic co-digestion of separately collected food waste with sewage sludge , were selected for comparison due to their potential to create synergies between local authorities , waste and water companies , with local circumstances determining which of the two options to adopt. A simplified process used for assessing and comparing the two food waste management options in the Anglian region in the UK , indicated that there are benefits in using the framework as a screening tool for identifying which option may be the most sustainable. To support decision-making , a detailed analysis that incorporates stakeholders ' perspectives is required. An additional use of the framework can be in providing recommendations for optimising food waste management options in a specific region , maximising their sustainability performance.
