 A new implementation has been made on CloudMC , a cloud-based platform presented in a previous work , in order to provide services for radiotherapy treatment verification by means of Monte Carlo in a fast , easy and economical way. A description of the architecture of the application and the new developments implemented is presented together with the results of the tests carried out to validate its performance. CloudMC has been developed over Microsoft Azure cloud. It is based on a map/reduce implementation for Monte Carlo calculations distribution over a dynamic cluster of virtual machines in order to reduce calculation time. CloudMC has been updated with new methods to read and process the information related to radiotherapy treatment verification: CT image set , treatment plan , structures and dose distribution files in DICOM format. Some tests have been designed in order to determine , for the different tasks , the most suitable type of virtual machines from those available in Azure. Finally , the performance of Monte Carlo verification in CloudMC is studied through three real cases that involve different treatment techniques , linac models and Monte Carlo codes. Considering computational and economic factors , D1_v2 and G1 virtual machines were selected as the default type for the Worker Roles and the Reducer Role respectively. Calculation times up to 33 min and costs of 16 $ were achieved for the verification cases presented when a statistical uncertainty below 2 % ( 2Ïƒ) was required. The costs were reduced to 3-6 $ when uncertainty requirements are relaxed to 4 %. Advantages like high computational power , scalability , easy access and pay-per-usage model , make Monte Carlo cloud-based solutions , like the one presented in this work , an important step forward to solve the long-lived problem of truly introducing the Monte Carlo algorithms in the daily routine of the radiotherapy planning process.
