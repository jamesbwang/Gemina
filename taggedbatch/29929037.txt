 Deinagkistrodon acutus , Trimeresurus stejnegeri , Protobothrops mucrosquamatus , Daboia russelii siamensis , Bungarus multicinctus and Naja atra are the six medically important venomous snake species in Taiwan. In this study , we characterized and compared their venom protein profiles using proteomic approaches. The major snake venom proteins were identified by GeLC-MS/MS and the total venom proteome was characterized by in-solution digestion coupled with LC-MS/MS. A total of 27-52 proteins , categorized into 23 protein families , were identified in each snake 's venom. The major venom components found in Viperidae species ( D. acutus , T. stejnegeri , P. mucrosquamatus and D. russelii) were C-type lectin , snake venom serine proteinase , venom metalloproteinase and phospholipase A There are six medically significant venomous snakes in Taiwan. The venoms of the four Viperidae species ( Deinagkistrodon acutus , Trimeresurus stejnegeri , Protobothrops mucrosquamatus and Daboia russelii siamensis) cause local tissue swelling; this symptom is also seen in N. atra envenomation in humans , potentially complicating the differential diagnosis of envenomation by N. atra and Viperidae species. Thus , characterization of the venom proteomes of the six Taiwanese snakes , including the relative abundance of the major components and species-specific protein ( s) in each venom type , could be useful for future venom research , including the development of new assay ( s) for detecting snake species-specific venom protein ( s) and new type ( s) of antivenom.
