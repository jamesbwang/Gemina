 Silyloxyarenes were utilized as electrophilic coupling partners with amines in the synthesis of aniline derivatives. A diverse range of amine substrates were used , including cyclic or acyclic secondary amines , secondary anilines , and sterically hindered primary anilines. Additionally , a range of sterically hindered and unhindered primary aliphatic amines were employed , which have previously been challenging with other classes of aryl ether electrophiles. Orthogonal couplings of silyloxyarenes with aryl methyl ethers are illustrated , where selectivity between the two C-O electrophiles is determined by ligand control , thereby allowing complementary and selective late-stage diversification of either electrophile. Finally , a sequential coupling displays the utility of this amination method along with the reversal in intrinsic reactivity between aryl methyl ethers and silyloxyarenes.
