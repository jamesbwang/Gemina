 Excessive iodide could induce intellectual damage in children , which has attracted broad attention. To investigate the neurotoxic effect of iodide and its mechanism , a human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cell line ( SH-SY5Y) was treated with different concentrations of potassium iodide ( KI). The results showed that excessive iodide could decrease cell viability , reduce glutathione ( GSH) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , and increase the degree of autophagy ( by changing the cellular ultrastructure and raising the autophagy-related mRNA and protein expression of LC3 , Beclin1 , and p62) , which were correlated with the immunofluorescence labeling. Furthermore , treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine ( 3MA) , antioxidant N-acetylcysteine ( NAC) and 30 mM KI for 24 h was conducted in the following research. 3MA significantly decreased autophagy-related mRNA and protein expression and improved cell viability , indicating that excess iodide induced autophagic cell death. In addition , oxidative stress regulated autophagy , reflected by the results that NAC decreased the mRNA and protein expression of LC3 , Beclin1 , and p62. In summary , autophagic cell death mediated by oxidative stress may participate in excessive iodide-induced SH-SY5Y cell death.
