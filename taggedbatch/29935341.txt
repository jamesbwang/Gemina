 In clinical practice , do-not-intubate ( DNI) orders are generally accompanied by do-not-resuscitate ( DNR) orders. Use of do-not-resuscitate ( DNR) orders is associated with older patient age , more comorbid conditions , and the withholding of treatments outside of the cardiac arrest setting. Previous studies have not unpacked the factors independently associated with DNI orders. To compare factors associated with combined DNR/DNI orders versus isolated DNR orders , as a means of elucidating factors associated with the addition of DNI orders. Retrospective chart review. Patients who died on a General Medicine or MICU service ( n = 197) at an urban public hospital over a 2-year period. Logistic regression was used to identify demographic and medical data associated with code status. Compared with DNR orders alone , DNR/DNI orders were associated with a higher median Charlson Comorbidity Index ( odds ratio ( OR) 1.27 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.13-1.43); older age ( OR 1.02 , 95 % CI 1.01-1.04); malignancy ( OR 2.27 , 95 % CI 1.18-4.37); and female sex ( OR 1.98 , 95 % CI 1.02-3.87). In the last 3 days of life , they were associated with morphine administration ( OR 2.76 , 95 % CI 1.43-5.33); and negatively associated with use of vasopressors/inotropes ( OR 10.99 , 95 % CI 4.83-25.00). Compared with DNR orders alone , combined DNR/DNI orders are more strongly associated with many of the same factors that have been linked to DNR orders. Awareness of the extent to which the two directives may be conflated during code status discussions is needed to promote patient-centered application of these interventions.
