 To investigate the coronal alignment of tibial plateaus in normal and osteoarthritic knees and to simulate the effects of a tibial cut performed in total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) using a kinematic alignment technique with standard instrumentation. The coronal alignment of tibial plateaus was measured in three groups including group 1 ( reference group) , 50 cadaveric tibiae showing no evidence of degenerative changes of tibial plateaus; group 2 , 49 patients who underwent MR of the knee , showing no or mild degenerative changes of the knee joint and , group 3 , 54 patients with knee osteoarthritis who underwent computer-assisted total knee arthroplasty. The coronal alignment of tibial plateaus averaged 2.4 ° with no significant differences between groups. The mean coronal orientation of tibial plateaus was 3 ° ± 2 ° in men and 1.6 ° ± 2 ° in women ( p = 0.03). A coronal alignment of tibial plateaus of 3 ° or more was found in 69 cases ( 45 %) and 5 ° or more in 23 ( 14.7 %). The simulation of a tibial cut performed with an error of 3 ° in varus in 15 % of the subjects showing a native coronal orientation of tibial plateaus of 3 ° or more , led to a final tibial cut greater 6 ° in 13.7 % of cases. A coronal alignment of tibial plateaus of 3 ° or more in varus was found in near half of normal subjects and osteoarthritic patients. A preoperative measurement of the coronal alignment of tibial plateaus is advisable in any patients scheduled for kinematic aligned TKA. As errors in the alignment of the tibial component of 3 ° or more may occur using standard instrumentations , the results of this study raise questions on performing a kinematic aligned TKA with standard instrumentations.
