 Children 's products are considered safe by the general population and doctors. Labels with terms such as `` hypoallergenic '' or `` dermatologically recommended and tested '' denote trust and credibility with the idea that they can be used by any individual. Patients with allergic contact dermatitis<disease> may be sensitive to allergens present in any product , including children 's. There is insufficient knowledge about allergens in these products in our country. We evaluated 254 children 's products , and at least one allergen was present in 236 ( 93 %) of them. The indication of a topical product should be careful and based on contact tests.
