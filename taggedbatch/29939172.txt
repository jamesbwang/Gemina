 The hormone cortisol is typically assessed in saliva , serum , or urine samples. More recently , cortisol has been successfully extracted from hair , including humans. The advantage of hair cortisol concentration is that it reflects a retrospective representation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA) axis function over time , much like hemoglobin A1C represents glycemic control. However , obtaining hair samples can be challenging , due to the cultural beliefs and hair care practices of minority participants. For example , African Americans may be reluctant to provide samples. Additionally , few researchers are trained to collect hair samples from African Americans. The purpose of this paper is to present a culturally informed protocol to help researchers obtain hair samples from African Americans. To illustrate the representative results of this protocol implementation , de-identified data from African Americans that participated in a community-based study on chronic stress are provided. Hair practice preferences are assessed. The participants are made comfortable by showing pictures of hair samples prior to cutting their hair. The single strain twist and gently pull method is used to collect approximately 30- 50 strands of hair from the posterior vertex region of the scalp. This protocol will significantly improve collection of hair samples from African Americans.
