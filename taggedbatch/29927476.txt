 Retinal acute toxicity may be produced by several etiologies. Iatrogenic toxicity is one of the most-feared complications related to vitreoretinal surgery. The authors report a case of retinal acute toxicity due to the use of perfluorooctane during an uneventful retinal detachment surgery done elsewhere. The aim of this report is to describe the clinical and optical coherence tomography features of this complication , which unfortunately occurred in more than 100 cases in Spain.
