 Globally , annual expenditure on ecological restoration of degraded areas for habitat improvement and biodiversity conservation is approximately $ 18bn. Seed farming of native plant species is crucial to meet restoration goals , but may be stymied by the disconnection of academic research in seed science and the lack of effective policies that regulate native seed production/supply. To illustrate this problem , we identified 1,122 plant species important for European grasslands of conservation concern and found that only 32 % have both fundamental seed germination data available and can be purchased as seed.
