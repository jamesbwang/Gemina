 It is estimated that one-third of the people with refractory epilepsy suffer from obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA). In a patient presenting with OSA symptoms and epilepsy , removing a portion of the soft palate ( uvulopalatoplasty) can be considered the treatment of choice for eliminating the OSA and decreasing the seizures<symptom>. Here , we report the results of our surgical approach by which the patient 's problems completely resolved , and we observed no symptoms of OSA or epilepsy after the surgery. After 10 years of follow-up , the patient is seizure-free and does not need any antiepileptic drugs.
