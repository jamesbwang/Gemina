 Genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer ( HBOC) and colorectal cancer ( CRC) predisposition have been shown to play a role in pancreatic cancer susceptibility. Growing evidence suggests that pancreatic cancer may be useful as a sentinel cancer to identify families that could benefit from HBOC or CRC surveillance , but to date pancreatic cancer is only considered an indication for genetic testing in the context of additional family history. Preliminary data generated at the Huntsman Cancer Hospital ( HCH) included variants identified on a custom 34-gene panel or 59-gene panel including both known HBOC and CRC genes for respective sets of 66 and 147 pancreatic cancer cases , unselected for family history. Given the strength of preliminary data and corresponding literature , 61 sequential pancreatic cancer cases underwent a custom 14-gene clinical panel. Sequencing data from HCH pancreatic cancer cases , pancreatic cancer cases of the Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA) , and an unselected pancreatic cancer screen from the Mayo Clinic were combined in a meta-analysis to estimate the proportion of carriers with pathogenic and high probability of pathogenic variants of uncertain significance ( HiP-VUS). Approximately 8.6 % of unselected pancreatic cancer cases at the HCH carried a variant with potential HBOC or CRC screening recommendations. A meta-analysis of unselected pancreatic cancer cases revealed that approximately 11.5 % carry a pathogenic variant or HiP-VUS. With the inclusion of both HBOC and CRC susceptibility genes in a panel test , unselected pancreatic cancer cases act as a useful sentinel cancer to identify asymptomatic at-risk relatives who could benefit from relevant HBOC and CRC surveillance measures.
