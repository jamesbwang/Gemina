 Peripheral nerve injury requires optimal conditions in both macro-environment and microenvironment for promotion of axonal regeneration. However , most repair strategies of traumatic peripheral nerve injury often lead to dissatisfying results in clinical outcome. Though various strategies have been carried out to improve the macro-environment , the underlying molecular mechanism of axon regeneration in the microenvironment provided by nerve conduit remains unclear. In this study , we evaluate the effects of from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( adMSCs) originating exosomes with respect to sciatic nerve regeneration and neurite growth. Molecular and immunohistochemical techniques were used to investigate the presence of characteristic exosome markers. A co-culture system was established to determine the effect of exosomes on neurite elongation in vitro. The in vivo walking behaviour of rats was evaluated by footprint analysis , and the nerve regeneration was assessed by immunocytochemistry. adMSCs secrete nano-vesicles known as exosomes , which increase neurite outgrowth in vitro and enhance regeneration after sciatic nerve injury in vivo. Furthermore , we showed the presence of neural growth factors transcripts in adMSC exosomes for the first time. Our results demonstrate that exosomes , constitutively produced by adMSCs , are involved in peripheral nerve regeneration and have the potential to be utilised as a therapeutic tool for effective tissue-engineered nerves.
