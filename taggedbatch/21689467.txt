 Multilocular thymic cysts<symptom> ( MTCs) associated with thymomas or thymic carcinomas ( TCs) are rare and may be misdiagnosed as other benign cystic lesions<symptom>. We retrospectively analysed 18 cases of thymomas or TCs associated with MTCs , which were retrieved from 309 consecutive patients with thymomas or TCs in the Chinese population , emphasizing clinicopathologic characteristics , immunophenotypes and the prognostic impact. A total of 14 tumours were described as cystic or solid-cystic masses , and the other 4 tumours were described as solid masses. Histologically , 2 atypical type A , 2 type AB , 1 type B1 , 8 type B2 , 1 type B3 , 1 microscopic thymoma ( type A) , 2 squamous cell carcinomas ( SCCs) and 1 lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma ( LELC) were classified. Prominent multilocular cystic areas with chronic inflammation<symptom> were observed. The follow-up ranged from 2 to 79 months. Sixteen patients survived without any evidence of recurrence after complete resection. Our study suggests that thymomas or TCs associated with MTCs are rare in the Chinese population and have a better clinical behaviour than thymomas or TCs without MTCs. Our data also expand the histologic spectrum of thymomas or TCs accompanied by MTC. To our knowledge , this is the first report of atypical type A thymoma and LELC associated with MTCs.
