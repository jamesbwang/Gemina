 Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. External beam radiotherapy by a variety of methods is a standard treatment option with excellent disease control. However , acute and late rectal side effects remain a limiting concern in intensification of therapy in higher-risk patients and in efforts to reduce treatment burden in others. A number of techniques have emerged that allow for high-radiation dose delivery to the prostate with reduced risk of rectal toxicity , including image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy , endorectal balloons and various forms of rectal spacers. Image-guided radiation therapy , either intensity-modulated radiation therapy or stereotactic ablative radiation therapy , in conjunction with a rectal spacer , is an efficacious means to reduce acute and long-term rectal toxicity.
