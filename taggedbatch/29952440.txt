 Diagnosis of Kawasaki Disease ( KD) can be challenging due to lack of a diagnostic test , and some children present with ` incomplete ' KD when not all diagnostic criteria are met. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG) and aspirin reduces the risk of coronary artery complications. There is sub-group of patients who are resistant to IVIG/aspirin therapy and are at increased risk of complications. Recent evidence suggests that additional treatment of this high-risk group with corticosteroids is beneficial in reducing this risk. We examine the treatment and coronary artery outcomes , by retrospective review of medical records , of a cohort of 32 paediatric patients with KD admitted to a single Irish tertiary centre from January 2010-December 2014. Twenty-eight percent of patients ( 9/32) had an incomplete diagnosis of KD; these patients received IVIG later compared to those with a complete KD diagnosis. 15/32 ( 47 %) had abnormal echocardiogram findings in the acute phase , 8/32 ( 25 %) had echocardiogram abnormalities at 6-week follow-up , and 4/32 ( 12.5 %) had persisting abnormalities. This study highlights the potential for adverse outcome in KD , the difficulty in diagnosis in ` incomplete ' cases , and the need to identify children at higher risk for adverse outcome where adjunctive therapies would be most beneficial.
