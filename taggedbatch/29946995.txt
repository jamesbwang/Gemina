 We report a case of subcutaneous infection caused by Exophiala<pathogen> oligosperma<pathogen>. Erythematous ulcerated plaque with exudate<symptom> was major clinical features. Histopathological examination showed yeast-like cells and fungal hyphae. Mycological and molecular identification revealed E.<pathogen> oligosperma<pathogen> as etiologic agent. Local debridement and oral itraconazole were effective. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of phaeohyphomycosis<disease> caused by E.<pathogen> oligosperma<pathogen> in mainland China. This report highlights the potential role of E.<pathogen> oligosperma<pathogen> as an emerging cause of infection in immunocompetent patients.
