 Several studies have been conducted to explore the prognostic value of miR-183 in different types of cancer; however , their results were controversial. Therefore , the present meta-analysis was conducted to comprehensively evaluate the prognostic value of miR-183 expression level in cancer. A comprehensive literature search was carried out by searching PubMed and EMBASE database between January 1966 and April 2017. Fixed effect and random effect models were used to evaluate the pooled hazard risk ( HR) and the relevant 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analysis were also carried out. A total of 12 studies published between 2011 and 2017 were included in the present meta-analysis. The meta-analysis result indicated that there was a significant association between miR-183 expression level and overall survival ( HR = 2.642; 95 % CI: 2.152-3.245) , and there was a significant association between miR-183 expression level and tumor progression ( HR = 2.403; 95 % CI: 1.267-4.559). In subgroup analysis , we found that high expression level was significantly associated with poor prognosis in most cancers ( HR = 2.824 , 95 % CI: 2.092-3.813); however , low miR-183 level was significantly associated with poor prognosis in melanoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( HR = 2.322 , 95 % CI: 1.337-4.031). The results of our meta-analysis indicated that the highly expressed miR-183 might predict poor survival of patients with most cancer types , whereas the downregulated miR-183 level might be associated with poor prognosis in patients with melanoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
