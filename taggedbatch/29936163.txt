 Rolling noise and structure-borne noise radiating from the bridge are two major sources of noise in light rapid transit ( LRT) bridges. To control the noise radiation from LRT bridges , an efficient numerical method for noise prediction is needed. In this study , a combined three-dimensional dynamic model and 2.5-dimensional acoustic model were used to investigate noise reduction in a rail and in a U-shaped girder bridge. The effects of three noise mitigation measures on noise control were then compared: installation of a noise barrier , use of a rail pad with a lower stiffness , and use of a floating ladder track. The corresponding noise reduction was investigated using the numerical method. A field test was conducted to validate the noise reduction effects. It was found that the noise barrier was more effective in reducing the rail noise , and the soft rail pad is more effective to control the bridge noise. The floating ladder track can significantly reduce bridge vibration , but the excessive vibration of the ladder track itself became another major noise source. The findings should guide the selection of appropriate mitigation measures for noise reduction in LRT bridges.
