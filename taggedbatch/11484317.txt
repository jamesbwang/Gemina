 The use of eponyms has a long history in medicine. But it is a rare case that a term not associated with a procedure or an anatomical description has come into use. The terms `` stent '' and `` splint '' in German and English used as a verb and a noun are a typical example. The coronary stent was named after Charles Thomas Stent ( 1807-1885). Charles Theodore Dotter ( 1920-1985) was the one who introduced the eponym into the literature of angiography in 1983. The change in urology occurred after an article of Willard Goodwin especially in the English literature but did not come into constant use in the German language.
