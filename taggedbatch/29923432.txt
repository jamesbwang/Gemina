 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL) is frequently complicated by cytopenias<symptom> , either due to bone<disease> marrow infiltration or autoimmunity , resulting in autoimmune hemolytic<symptom> anemia<symptom> ( AIHA) , immune thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( ITP) , pure red cell aplasia ( PRCA) , or autoimmune neutropenia ( AIN). Morbidity due to autoimmune cytopenias<symptom> ( AIC) can be substantial; in addition , infection risk increases and pre-existing infections might deteriorate due to immunosuppressive medication. In the aging population , CLL occurs more frequently and AIC related to CLL represent a growing clinical challenge. Areas covered: This review summarizes current knowledge on pathophysiological mechanisms involved in AIC development and their prognostic significance. It provides diagnostic criteria and a treatment guideline for daily clinical practice , which includes the role of novel targeted agents. Expert commentary: The pathophysiology of AIC involves loss of self-tolerance , antigen presentation by malignant CLL cells , and autoantibody production through aberrant T- and B-cell function. The value of detecting autoantibodies via the direct antiglobulin test ( DAT) is disputable , since a positive test does not imply overt hemolysis<symptom>. Importantly , AIC should be distinguished from infiltrative cytopenias<symptom> , because of prognostic and therapeutic consequences. Compared to chemotherapy , triggering AIC by targeted therapies is less common and , hence , these agents may be valuable as treatment for CLL-related immune cytopenias<symptom>.
