 Incorporating D amino acids in the protein design alphabet can in principle multiply the design space by many orders of magnitude. All native proteins are polymers composed of L chiral amino acids. Practically limitless in diversity over amino acid sequences , protein structure is limited in folds and thus shapes , principally due to the poly L stereochemistry of their backbone. To diversify shapes , we introduced both L- and D Î±-amino acids as design alphabets to explore the possibility of generating novel folds , varied in chemical as well as stereo-chemical sequence. Now , to have stereochemically-defined proteins tuned chemically , we present the Inverse Design and Automation Software , IDeAS. Retro-fitting side chains on a backbone with L and D stereochemistry , the software demonstrate functional fits over stereo-chemically diverse folds in a range of applications of interest in protein design.
