 Tuned calcium entry through voltage-gated calcium channels is a key requirement for many cellular functions. This is ensured by channel gates which open during membrane depolarizations and seal the pore at rest. The gating process is determined by distinct sub-processes: movement of voltage-sensing domains ( charged S4 segments) as well as opening and closure of S6 gates. Neutralization of S4 charges revealed that pore opening of CaV1 .2 is triggered by a `` gate releasing '' movement of all four S4 segments with activation of IS4 ( and IIIS4) being a rate-limiting stage. Segment IS4 additionally plays a crucial role in channel inactivation. Remarkably , S4 segments carrying only a single charged residue efficiently participate in gating. However , the complete set of S4 charges is required for stabilization of the open state. Voltage clamp fluorometry , the cryo-EM structure of a mammalian calcium channel , biophysical and pharmacological studies , and mathematical simulations have all contributed to a novel interpretation of the role of voltage sensors in channel opening , closure , and inactivation. We illustrate the role of the different methodologies in gating studies and discuss the key molecular events leading CaV channels to open and to close.
