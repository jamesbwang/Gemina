 Dual energy computed tomography has been available for more than 10 years; however , it is currently on the cusp of widespread clinical use. The way dual energy data are acquired and assembled must be appreciated at the clinical level so that the various reconstruction types can extend its diagnostic power. The type of scanner that is present in a given practice dictates the way in which the dual energy data can be presented and used. This article compares and contrasts how dual source , rapid kV switching , and spectral technologies acquire and present dual energy reconstructions to practicing radiologists.
