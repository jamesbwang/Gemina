 Due to its high invasiveness , glioblastoma is difficult to treat by surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy or any combination therapy. Syndecan binding protein ( SDCBP) , a widely distributed intracellular scaffold protein , has an important role in both physiological and pathological process. In the current work , we have identified target sequences for miR-135a-5p and miR-124-3p in the 3 '- untranslated region of the SDCBP mRNA. Therefore , we have investigated the relationship between SDCBP , miR-135a-5p and miR-124-3p in glioblastoma multiforme cells T98G and U87 in vitro and in vivo. Dual luciferase activity assay documented that SDCBP is , in fact , the target of miR-135a-5p , miR-124-3. Western blot , qRT-PCR , proliferation , migration , and invasion assays have demonstrated that of silencing SDCBP or overexpressing miR-135a-5p/ miR-124-3p significantly interferes with the malignant properties of glioblastoma cells. In vivo studies have shown that silencing SDCBP or overexpressing miR-135a-5p/ miR-124-3p result in a marked decrease of tumor size and prolong life of tumor-bearing mice. A therapy combining the three treatments inhibits synergistically subcutaneous tumor growth in nude mice. In conclusion , proliferation , migration and invasion of glioblastoma can be inhibited by targeted regulation of SDCBP through upregulation of miR-135a-5p and miR-124-3p.
