 Design and synthesis of biocompatible and multifunctional photothermal agents is crucial for effective cancer phototherapy. In order to achieve this ambition , simple D-A-D structural bisbithiophenyl diketopyrrolopyrrole ( TDPP) was fabricated. In this molecule , the donor , 2-thiophenylboric acid , was conjugated via Suzuki coupling reaction , which could expand the emission wavelength to the red region of the spectrum. TDPP could self-assemble into stable and uniform nanoparticles ( TDPP NPs) in assistant of amphiphilic Pluronic F-127 polymer. Exposing TDPP NPs ( 100 Î¼g/mL) aqueous dispersion to 638 nm ( 0.61 W/cm
