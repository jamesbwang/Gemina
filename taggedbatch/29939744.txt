 G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs) signal through both G-protein-dependent and G-protein-independent pathways , and β-arrestin recruitment is the most recognized one of the latter. Biased ligands selective for either pathway are expected to regulate biological functions of GPCRs in a more precise way , therefore providing new drug molecules with superior efficacy and/or reduced side effects. During the past decade , biased ligands have been discovered and developed for many GPCRs , such as the μ opioid receptor , the angiotensin II receptor type 1 , the dopamine D
