 Endogenous kappa opioids mediate pathological responses to stress in animal models. However , the relationship of the kappa opioid receptor ( KOR) to life stress and to psychopathology in humans is not well described. This pilot study sought , for the first time , to quantify KOR in major depressive disorder ( MDD) in vivo in humans using positron emission tomography ( PET). KOR binding was quantified in vivo by PET imaging with the (
