 The UK 's Life Sciences Strategy provides UK clinical pharmacologists with a unique opportunity to enhance the impact of their discipline on patients and the NHS as well as the pharmaceutical industry. The full benefits of electronic prescribing systems , supported by artificial intelligence , will require clinical pharmacological expertise. Similarly , the Strategy 's support for ` healthy ageing ' will only be realized if clinical pharmacologists are able to use their expertise in promoting the safe and effective use of medicines in older people. Furthermore , their needs to be an active- and continuing- collaboration between clinical pharmacologists in the NHS and the pharmaceutical industry in general as well as with the discipline of pharmaceutical medicine.
