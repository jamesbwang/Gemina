 The intestinal immune system is challenged daily with the task of recognizing and eliminating pathogens while simultaneously tolerating dietary and commensal antigens. All components must effectively coordinate to differentiate a continual barrage of environmental cues and mount appropriate responses dependent on the nature of the stimuli encountered. Playing a pivotal role , the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AHR) is a chemical sensor that detects both dietary and microbial cues and is important for development , maintenance , and function of several types of intestinal immune cells , particularly innate lymphoid cells ( ILCs) and T cells. In this review , we will highlight recent advances in our knowledge of the role of AHR signaling in ILCs , T cells , B cells , and dendritic cells.
