 Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA) is resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics and can cause severe infections that are difficult to treat. Eradication strategies with conventional antibiotics are not always effective and alternative approaches are warranted. Here , we tested the hypothesis that daily supplementation with vitamin D for 12 months would reduce MRSA carriage rates among a group of persistent carriers. This was a double-blind , placebo-controlled randomized trial with n = 65 persistent MRSA carriers with 25-hydroxy vitamin D www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02178488.
