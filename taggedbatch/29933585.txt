 This paper proposes a low-profile textile-modified meander line Inverted-F Antenna ( IFA) with variable width and spacing meanders , for Industrial Scientific Medical ( ISM) 2.4-GHz Wireless Body Area Networks ( WBAN) , optimized with a novel metaheuristic algorithm. Specifically , a metaheuristic known as Coral Reefs Optimization with Substrate Layer ( CRO-SL) is used to obtain an optimal antenna for sensor systems , which allows covering properly and resiliently the 2.4 ‚Åª 2.45-GHz industrial scientific medical bandwidth. Flexible pad foam has been used to make the designed prototype with a 1.1-mm thickness. We have used a version of the algorithm that is able to combine different searching operators within a single population of solutions. This approach is ideal to deal with hard optimization problems , such as the design of the proposed meander line IFA. During the optimization phase with the CRO-SL , the proposed antenna has been simulated using CST Microwave Studio software , linked to the CRO-SL by means of MATLAB implementation and Visual Basic Applications ( VBA) code. We fully describe the antenna design process , the adaptation of the CRO-SL approach to this problem and several practical aspects of the optimization and details on the algorithm & rsquo; s performance. To validate the simulation results , we have constructed and measured two prototypes of the antenna , designed with the proposed algorithm. Several practical aspects such as sensitivity during the antenna manufacturing or the agreement between the simulated and constructed antenna are also detailed in the paper.
