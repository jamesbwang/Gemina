 A rapid oxygen-initiated and- regulated controlled radical polymerization was conducted under ambient temperature and atmosphere. The reaction between triethylborane and oxygen provides ethyl radicals , which initiate and mediate the radical polymerization. The controlled radical polymerization was achieved using RAFT chain transfer agents ( CTA) without any process of removing oxygen , providing well-defined polymers with almost full conversion ( > 95 %) in a short period ( 15 min). High-throughput screening was used to discover the suitable conditions for various CTA and monomers. To show the versatility of this method , a polymer library containing 25 well-defined polymers with different compositions ( block and statistical copolymers) and molecular weights were synthesized in 1 h via high-throughput synthesis technique. A polymer-painting technique was developed using this method , forming films with spatial control and excellent control in molecular weight and dispersity.
