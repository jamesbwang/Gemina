 This study examined the potential moderating effects of religiosity on the associations between exposure to acts of political violence and posttraumatic stress symptoms ( PTS) among Jewish adolescents in Israel. In addition , it examined whether self-reported physical and interpersonal exposure to acts of political violence predicts PTS symptoms beyond the objective exposure effects ( i.e. , the proximity of participants ' place of residence to high- , moderate- , or low-intensity political violence). A representative sample of 2,992 Jewish high school students ( Grades 10 and 11) was taken. We used self-reporting to measure the level of religiosity and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised ( IES-R) to measure PTS symptoms. Results show that self-reported exposure to acts of political violence adds a significant additional amount of variance to the prediction of PTS symptoms after objective exposure is already included in the regression equation. Religiosity was found as a risk factor for PTS symptoms such that the greater the religiosity of the adolescents , the higher their PTS symptoms. Therefore , prevention interventions should target the vulnerable group of religious Jewish adolescents.
