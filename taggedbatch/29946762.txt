 The association among serum homocysteine ( HCY) , symmetric dimethylarginine ( SDMA) , and asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA) is of interest in endothelial dysfunction , although the underlying pathology is not fully elucidated. We investigated the relationship of HCY with SDMA and ADMA regarding their long-time outcome and the age dependency of HCY , SDMA , and ADMA values in claudicant patients with lower extremity arterial disease. 120 patients were included in a prospective observational study ( observation time 7.96 ± 1.3 years) with cardiovascular mortality as the main outcome parameter. Patients with intermittent claudication prior to their first endovascular procedure were included. HCY , SDMA , and ADMA were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Cutoff values for HCY ( ≤/ > 15 µmol/l) , SDMA ( ≤/ > 0.75 µmol/l) , and ADMA ( ≤/ > 0.8 µmol/l) differed significantly regarding cardiovascular mortality ( p < 0.001 , p < 0.001 , p = 0.017 , respectively). Age correlated significantly with HCY ( r = 0.393; p < 0.001) , SDMA ( r = 0.363; p < 0.001) , and ADMA ( r = 0.210; p = 0.021). HCY and SDMA ( r = 0.295; p = 0.001) as well as SDMA and ADMA ( r = 0.380; p < 0.001) correlated with each other , while HCY and ADMA did not correlate ( r = 0.139; p = 0.130). Patients older than 65 years had higher values of HCY ( p < 0.001) and SDMA ( p = 0.01) , but not of ADMA ( p = 0.133). In multivariable linear regression , age was the only significant independent risk factor for cardiovascular death ( beta coefficient 0.413; 95 % CI 0.007-0.028; p = 0.001). Age correlated significantly with HCY , SDMA , and ADMA. However , only age was an independent predictor for cardiovascular death. Older patients have higher values of HCY and SDMA than younger subjects suggesting age-adjusted cutoff values of HCY and SDMA due to strong age dependency.
