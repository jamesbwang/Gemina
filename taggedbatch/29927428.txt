 Currently , there are many different surgical approaches to orbital pathology. This pathology rarely occurs in neurosurgical practice , and neurosurgeons have often used approaches that can be accompanied by negative cosmetic and functional outcomes. We present a case report of orbital cavernoma removal via a minimally invasive approach. The presented case demonstrates successful removal of orbital cavernoma using the transpalpebral approach: a skin incision along a natural fold of the upper eyelid and orbitofrontal keyhole craniotomy. In the postoperative period , existing symptoms regressed; the patient assessed the cosmetic effect as excellent. The transpalpebral keyhole approach can be an excellent alternative to traditional approaches to orbital cavernomas. This approach demonstrated its efficacy and safety in skull base surgery and provided excellent functional and cosmetic outcomes.
