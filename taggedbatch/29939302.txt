 Microbial-derived uremic toxins , p-cresyl sulfate ( PCS) , indoxyl sulfate ( IS) and indole 3-acetic acid ( IAA) , have been associated with the burden of chronic kidney disease ( CKD). Prebiotics have emerged as an alternative to modulate the gut environment and to attenuate toxin production. This trial aims to investigate the effect of a prebiotic fructooligosaccharide ( FOS) on uremic toxins of non-dialysis-dependent CKD ( NDD-CKD) patients. A double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized trial was conducted for 3 months. In all , 50 nondiabetic NDD-CKD patients ( estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) < 45 mL/min/1 .73 m2) , aged 18-80 years , were allocated to prebiotic ( FOS , 12 g/day) or placebo ( maltodextrin , 12 g/day) groups. Primary outcomes were changes in serum ( total and free) and urinary ( total) PCS. Secondary outcomes included changes in IS , IAA , serum markers of intestinal permeability ( zonulin) , gut-trophic factors ( epidermal growth factor and glucagon-like peptide-2) , eGFR , inflammation<symptom> ( high sensitive c-reactive protein and interleukin-6) , homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance , lipid profile and gastrointestinal symptoms. From 50 participants ( 54 % men , 57.3 ± 14.6 years and eGFR 21.4 ± 7.6 mL/min/1 .73 m2) , 46 completed the follow-up. No changes in dietary intake or gastrointestinal symptoms were observed. There was a trend in the difference of serum total ΔPCS ( treatment effect adjusted for baseline levels: -12.4 mg/L; 95 % confidence interval ( -5.6 to 0.9 mg/L; P = 0.07) and serum-free Δ % PCS ( intervention -8.6 ( -41.5 to 13.9 %) versus placebo 3.5 ( -28.8 to 85.5 %); P = 0.07) between the groups. The trend in the difference of serum total ΔPCS was independent of eGFR and dietary protein: fiber ratio intake. No difference was found in urinary PCS. Aside from the decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the intervention , no differences were observed in the change of IS , IAA or other secondary outcome between the groups. Our result suggests the potential of FOS in reducing serum total and free PCS in nondiabetic NDD-CKD patients.
