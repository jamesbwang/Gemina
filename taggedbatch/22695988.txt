 Microbial aromatic catabolism offers a promising approach to convert lignin , a vast source of renewable carbon , into useful products. Aryl-O-demethylation is an essential biochemical reaction to ultimately catabolize coniferyl and sinapyl lignin-derived aromatic compounds , and is often a key bottleneck for both native and engineered bioconversion pathways. Here , we report the comprehensive characterization of a promiscuous P450 aryl-O-demethylase , consisting of a cytochrome P450 protein from the family CYP255A ( GcoA) and a three-domain reductase ( GcoB) that together represent a new two-component P450 class. Though originally described as converting guaiacol to catechol , we show that this system efficiently demethylates both guaiacol and an unexpectedly wide variety of lignin-relevant monomers. Structural , biochemical , and computational studies of this novel two-component system elucidate the mechanism of its broad substrate specificity , presenting it as a new tool for a critical step in biological lignin conversion.
