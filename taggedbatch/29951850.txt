 Physical activity is a common adjunctive therapy in psychiatric and psychosomatic hospitals. In the present study , we assessed the effects of an exercise program , integrated into routine inpatient treatment , on cognitive performance and subjective severity of depression<symptom> in a sample of patients suffering from major depression<symptom>. We randomized n = 38 patients with unipolar depression<symptom> to either physical exercise ( n = 18) or occupational therapy as an active control treatment ( n = 20). Both treatments were delivered in group format over a period of 3-4 weeks. Data indicate that there were significant improvements of cognitive functions and depressive symptoms in both groups , with specific treatment effects in reaction time and in short-term verbal memory favoring the physical activity group. In conclusion , we found physical exercise to be a feasible , easy-to-implement add-on therapy for depressive patients with promising effects on cognitive performance. However , these results need to be replicated in larger samples with an extended follow-up.
