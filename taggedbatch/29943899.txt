 We aimed at assessing whether a head-mounted light therapy device , enriched in blue wavelengths , suppresses melatonin secretion and improves vigilant attention in the late evening hours. We also assessed whether using such light device is associated with discomfort and physiological stress. Seventeen healthy young participants ( eight females) participated in a counterbalanced within-subject design during which they were exposed for 2 hr before habitual sleep time to a blue-enriched light ( 1500 lx) or to a lower intensity red-light ( 150 lx) control condition , using a new-generation light emitting diode ( LED) head-mounted device. Compared to the red light control condition , blue-enriched light significantly reduced melatonin secretion and reaction times during a psychomotor vigilance task while no significant differences were detected in discomfort and cortisol levels. These results suggest that , compared to a control condition , blue-enriched light , delivered by a new-generation head-mounted device , elicits typical non-visual responses to light without detectable discomfort and physiological stress. They suggest that such devices might constitute an effective alternative to standard light boxes.
