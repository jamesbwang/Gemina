 The prevalence of nicotine dependence is higher than that for any other substance abuse disorder; still , the underlying mechanisms are not fully established. To this end , we studied acute effects by nicotine on neurotransmission in the dorsolateral striatum<pathogen> , a key brain region with respect to the formation of habits. Electrophysiological recordings in acutely isolated brain slices from rodent showed that nicotine ( 10 nm to 10 μm) produced an LTD of evoked field potentials. Current-clamp recordings revealed no significant effect by nicotine on membrane voltage or action potential frequency , indicating that the effect by nicotine is primarily synaptic. Nicotine did not modulate sIPSCs , or the connectivity between fast-spiking interneurons and medium spiny neurons , as assessed by whole-cell recordings combined with optogenetics. However , the frequency of sEPSCs was significantly depressed by nicotine. The effect by nicotine was mimicked by agonists targeting α7- or α4-containing nAChRs and blocked in slices pretreated with a mixture of antagonists targeting these receptor subtypes. Nicotine-induced LTD was furthermore inhibited by dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and occluded by D2 receptor agonist. In addition , modulation of cholinergic neurotransmission suppressed the responding to nicotine , which might reflect upon the postulated role for nAChRs as a presynaptic filter to differentially govern dopamine release depending on neuronal activity. Nicotine-induced suppression of excitatory inputs onto medium spiny neurons may promote nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation and putatively initiate neuroadaptations that could contribute to the transition toward compulsive drug taking.
