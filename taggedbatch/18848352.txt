 The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of camphorquinone concentration in physical-mechanical properties of experimental flowable composites in order to find the concentration that results in maximum conversion , balanced mechanical strength , and minimum shrinkage stress. Model composites based on BISGMA/TEGDMA with 70 % wt filler loading were prepared containing different concentrations of camphorquinone ( CQ) on resin matrix ( 0.25 % , 0.50 % , 1 % , 1.50 % , and 2 % by weight). Degree of conversion was determined by FTIR. Surface hardness was assessed before and after 24 h ethanol storage and softening rate was determined. Depth of cure was determined by Knoop hardness evaluation at different depths. Color was assessed by reflectance spectrophotometer , employing the CIE-Lab system. Flexural strength and elastic modulus were determined by a three-point bending test. Shrinkage stress was determined in a Universal Testing Machine in a high compliance system. Data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey 's test (
