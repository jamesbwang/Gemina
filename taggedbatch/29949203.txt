 Mid-face Toddler Excoriation Syndrome<disease><symptom> ( MiTES) is a condition recently reported in 3 unrelated children. We describe 5 further children , from 4 families , with facial lesions<symptom> typical of MiTES , in whom mutation analysis of PRDM12 was carried out. Homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic expansions of the PRDM12 poly-alanine tract were found in 4 of 5 affected individuals , in 3 families. Our finding of autosomal recessive mutations in PRDM12 in 4 out of 5 patients with MiTES extends the phenotypic spectrum of PRDM12 mutations , which usually cause HSAN8 , characterised by mutilating self-inflicted wounds<disease><symptom> of extremities , lips and tongue. By contrast , MiTES shows severe mid-facial lesions<symptom> with little if any evidence of generalised pain insensitivity. The condition is probably genetically heterogeneous and other congenital insensitivity to pain ( CIP) and HSAN genes such as SCN11A may be implicated. This new understanding of the nature of MiTES , which can masquerade as factitious disease , will facilitate appropriate management. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
