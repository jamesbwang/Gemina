 Geometries of Early Pleistocene ( 2.58 to 0.78 million years ( Ma) ago) ice sheets in northwest Europe are poorly constrained but are required to improve our understanding of past ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere coupling. Ice sheets are believed to have changed in their response to orbital forcing , becoming , from about 1.2 Ma ago , volumetrically larger and longer-lived. We present a multiproxy data set for the North Sea , extending to over a kilometer below the present-day seafloor , which demonstrates spatially extensive glaciation of the basin from the earliest Pleistocene. Ice sheets repeatedly entered the North Sea , south of 60 Â° N , in water depths of up to ~ 250 m from 2.53 Ma ago and subsequently grounded in the center of the basin , in deeper water , from 1.87 Ma ago. Despite lower global ice volumes , these ice sheets were near comparable in spatial extent to those of the Middle and Late Pleistocene but possibly thinner and moving over slippery ( low basal resistance) beds.
