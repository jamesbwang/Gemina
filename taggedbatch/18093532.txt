 Many studies revealed a link between temporal information processing ( TIP) in a millisecond range and speech perception. Previous studies indicated a dysfunction in TIP accompanied by deficient phonemic hearing in children with specific language impairment ( SLI). In this study we concentrate in SLI on phonetic identification , using the voice-onset-time ( VOT) phenomenon in which TIP is built-in. VOT is crucial for speech perception , as stop consonants ( like/ t/ vs./ d/) may be distinguished by an acoustic difference in time between the onsets<symptom> of the consonant ( stop release burst) and the following vibration of vocal folds ( voicing). In healthy subjects two categories ( voiced and unvoiced) are determined using VOT task. The present study aimed at verifying whether children with SLI indicate a similar pattern of phonetic identification as their healthy peers and whether the intervention based on TIP results in improved performance on the VOT task. Children aged from 5 to 8 years (
