 The hawthorn leaves have the effect of activating blood , removing blood stasis , regulating qi through the veins , dissolving turbidity and lowering lipid. Procyanidinis is one of its main active components and plays an important role in regulating vasoactivity. Previous studies showed that the regulating effect of procyanidins was related to its regulation on nitric oxide secretion from vascular endothelial cells , and this effect was dependent on the extracellular calcium concentration , suggesting that the changes in intracellular calcium ion concentration in endothelial cells may play a key role in this process. However , the research on this issue is still insufficient so far. This study is aimed to observe the effect of hawthorn leaf oligomeric procyanidins ( HLP) on calcium mobilization of vascular endothelial cells , and investigate the underlying mechanism. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC) were cultured
