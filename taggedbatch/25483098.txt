 The B-cell lymphoma 2-associated anthanogene ( BAG3) protein is expressed most prominently in the heart , the skeletal muscle , and in many forms of cancer. In the heart , it serves as a co-chaperone with heat shock<symptom> proteins in facilitating autophagy; binds to B-cell lymphoma 2 , resulting in inhibition of apoptosis; attaches actin to the Z disk , providing structural support for the sarcomere; and links the Î±-adrenergic receptor with the L-type Ca
