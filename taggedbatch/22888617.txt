 Suicide is one of the public health problems worldwide , but it lacks regular relevant reporting system. This issue is more important among women who play an influential role in the family and society. Therefore , the assessment of recent relevant studies is important to detect suicide-related factors and to help make the decisions about public health. The aim of the current study was to determine socioeconomic and psychological factors of suicide attempts in Iranian women using a descriptive meta-analysis method. All domestic scientific databases were searched using `` suicide '' keyword. A search was also done using keywords of corresponding to Medical Subject Headings including `` Iran , '' `` suicide , '' `` psychosocial determinants , '' `` behavior , '' `` suicide commitment , '' `` suicide thoughts , '' and `` women. '' Overall , 3061 articles were retrieved through the initial search. Finally , 69 studies from nine provinces were included for the analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using R software version 3.2.6 with Metafor package version 1.9-9. Using nine selected studies , frequency of urban family ( prevalence = 85 % , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 0.68-1.00) , nonacademic education ( prevalence = 53 % , 95 % CI = 0.45-0.61) , and family problems ( prevalence = 34 % , 95 % CI = 0.19-0.49) was identified as the most important related factor of suicide compared to any other related factors. According to the results , family problems and lower education are associated with suicide attempts. Thus , providing training programs and family consultant services are recommended to reduce the incidence of suicide attempts.
