 We analyzed the expression of galectin-1 and galectin-3 in tumor tissue in stomach and colorectal cancer with and without tissue eosinophilia. Low expression of galectin-3 was detected in all patients with malignant gastrointestinal tumors irrespective of the presence of eosinophilia. Low expression of galectin-1 was detected only in patients with gastrointestinal cancer associated with eosinophilia. Association of galectin-1 expression with eosinophilic infiltration of the tumor tissue in stomach and colorectal cancer was detected.
