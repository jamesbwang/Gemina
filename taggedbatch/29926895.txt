 This paper introduces the study on the European Union Project on complementary therapies and discusses project outputs and results. The goal of the European Union Project was to improve the professional knowledge and skills of women 's health and oncology nurses regarding CT.. The increasing and widespread use of complementary therapies in the women 's health and oncology population requires nurses to be educated about their suitable and safe use. Many nurses do not have proper training in complementary therapies and therefore should not inform their patients about them. The ` Improving the Nursing Care with Best Complementary Therapy Strategies Based on European Union Standards ' ( BestCARE) project was a strategic partnership within Erasmus plus for vocational education and training. The BestCARE project was coordinated by the Akdeniz University Nursing Faculty and was carried out with six partners from Turkey and Europe. Fifteen nurses from Turkey and Italy were trained in complementary therapies in England. In addition , training courses and seminars were held in Turkey and Italy for women 's health and oncology nurses. The BestCARE programme consisted of 14 work packages. The BestCARE programme was implemented via websites , an e-learning training programme , training videos , reference and handbook , a curriculum proposal on complementary therapies and a simulation laboratory. The BestCARE project allowed nurses to gain knowledge , experience and skills about complementary therapies and created a cultural awareness and sensitivity towards patients , caregivers and health professionals.
