 Recently , there has been a move towards positive reinforcement using food rewards in animal training. By definition , rewards function as reinforcers if they increase or maintain the frequency of behaviour that they follow. However , in operant conditioning tasks animals frequently show systematic changes in performance- in particular a reduction in responding over time. One suggested strategy to avoid such performance decrements is to provide a variety of food rewards , rather than the same food reward in all trials. The enhancement of appetitive behaviour and consumption by reward variation is referred to as ` variety effect '. We investigated whether dogs preferred a variable or a constant food reward in a concurrent two-choice test. Of 16 dogs , six subjects showed a significant preference for the varied food reward and six for the constant food reward , while four dogs exhibited no significant preference for either option. At the group level , there was a significant effect of block: preference for the varied food reward increased across six blocks of ten trials each. Thus , although some individuals may prefer a single , favourite food reward in the short term , introducing variation in reward types may maintain dogs ' motivation in operant tasks over a longer time period.
