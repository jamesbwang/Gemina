 Imidacloprid is widely used to manage tomato spotted wilt disease ( TSW) in tobacco , tomato , and pepper , caused by Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus ( TSWV) and spread by the tobacco thrips , Frankliniella fusca<pathogen> Hinds ( Thysanoptera: Thripidae). Imidacloprid suppresses transmission of TSWV by reducing probing and feeding by adult thrips on treated plants , thereby reducing the probability of transmission by infectious thrips. Because imidacloprid does not reduce probing and feeding on treated plants to zero , the reduction in transmission probability per viruliferous thrips can be offset by an increase in the number of viruliferous thrips challenging treated plants. A composite of these effects which we call ` pathogen pressure ' experienced by plants is a function of thrips population size , the proportion of those thrips that are viruliferous , and the probability that viruliferous thrips successfully inoculate plants. To better understand the relationship between imidacloprid 's effect on virus transmission , pathogen pressure , and TSW incidence in tobacco , we modeled TSW incidence as a function of the two most important variables affecting components of pathogen pressure , temperature , and precipitation , and the dependence of imidacloprid 's effect on pathogen pressure. A model incorporating imidacloprid 's effect as a reduction in pathogen pressure was found to be more descriptive than models incorporating the effect as a reduction in TSW incidence. Results reveal maximum proportional reduction in TSW incidence resulting from imidacloprid use is associated with minimal potential TSW incidence. As pathogen pressure increases , potential TSW incidence approaches 100 % , and the benefits of imidacloprid use are highest at intermediate levels of pathogen pressure.
