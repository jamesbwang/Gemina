 This report detailed four cases of tumor recurrence in the subfrontal region after cerebellar medulloblastoma resection without local relapse and explored the causes of recurrence. In addition , a case-based update and insight into the entity is attempted. All four patients received cerebellar medulloblastoma resection and postoperative radiotherapy. They were admitted to our hospital when they were found to have a recurrent tumor in the subfrontal region of the anterior skull base. All four patients received re-resection of the tumor , which was confirmed to be recurrent medulloblastoma by postoperative pathological results. All patients received local radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy after recurrent tumor resection. They all died due to multiple<symptom> organ<symptom> failure<symptom> resulting from tumor metastasis to other sites or tumor regrowth within 2 years after the second operation. Medulloblastoma metastasize to the subfrontal region and develop a homogenous recurrence is rare. Underdosage of radiation , a gravity-related sanctuary effect , surgical position , and perioperative hydrocephalus<symptom> management might be factors contributing to this supratentorial meningeal recurrence. A better prevention of tumor recurrence might be achieved by extensive microsurgical tumor resection in the initial operation and by minimizing the need for a permanent V-P shunt in the treatment of perioperative hydrocephalus<symptom> as well as by administering full-dose radiotherapy to the region of the cribriform plate in the subfrontal area.
