 Quinclorac is a selective herbicide commonly used in China to control monocotyledonous weeds in paddy fields. A field experiment was conducted to quantify the environmental behavior of quinclorac in acidic paddy soil under rice ( Oryza sativa L.) field conditions , and to evaluate the risk of its residues to the subsequent crop of tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum L.). Rice was sprayed once with quinclorac 50 % WP at 562.5 , 375.0 , or 187.5 g a.i. ha
