 HIV<pathogen> infection is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Irisin is a miokyne secreted by skeletal muscle , which may influence insulin homeostasis , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) and atherosclerosis. Our objective was to evaluate the relationships between serum irisin , insulin homeostasis , NAFLD and subclinical atherosclerosis in HIV-infected males. Cross-sectional study in a cohort of HIV-infected patients. Inclusion criteria: men older than 18 years; antiretroviral therapy ( ART)- naïve or on effective ART ( < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) without changes in the previous 6 months; no diabetes or hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C. Irisin was measured by enzymatic immunoassay ( Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) , insulin sensitivity by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR) , as well as the 2-hour continuous infusion of glucose with model assessment ( CIGMA-HOMA). Hepatic steatosis was measured by 1-H magnetic resonance spectroscopy , subclinical atherosclerosis by evaluation of carotid intima-media thickness ( C-IMT) , measured by Ultrasonography. Eight nine men ( age 42.0 ± 8.3 years , duration of HIV<pathogen> infection 7.9 ± 5.6 years , CD4 count 547 ± 279 cells/mL) were included. Circulating irisin was positively related to HOMA-IR and CIGMA-HOMA , hepatic triglyceride content , and to VAT/SAT ratio. Higher irisin concentrations were associated with higher C-IMT , although this association did not persist in multivariate analysis. Lipodystrophy and a higher baseline PAI-1 concentration were independently associated with C-IMT. In male HIV<pathogen> patients without diabetes , higher irisin concentrations are positively associated with insulin resistance , NAFLD and subclinical atherosclerosis. However , waist-hip-ratio is the main determinant of insulin resistance , and PAI-1 and lipodystrophy were the strongest determinants of IMT in this population.
