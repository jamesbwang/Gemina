 Cryo-electron tomography ( CET) is uniquely suited to obtain structural information from a wide range of biological scales , integrating and bridging knowledge from molecules to cells. In particular , CET can be used to visualise molecular structures in their native environment. Depending on the experiment , a varying degree of resolutions can be achieved , with the first near-atomic molecular structures becoming recently available. The power of CET has increased significantly in the last 5 years , in parallel with improvements in cryo-EM hardware and software that have also benefited single-particle reconstruction techniques. In this review , we cover the typical CET pipeline , starting from sample preparation , to data collection and processing , and highlight in particular the recent developments that support structural biology
