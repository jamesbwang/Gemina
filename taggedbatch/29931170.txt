 Genomic imprinting is a phenomenon that causes parent-origin-specific monoallelic expression of a small subset of genes , known as imprinted genes , by parentally inherited epigenetic marks. Imprinted genes at the delta-like homolog 1 gene ( Dlk1)- type III iodothyronine deiodinase gene ( Dio3) imprinted domain , regulated by intergenic differentially methylated region ( IG-DMR) , are essential for normal development of late embryonic stages. Although the functions of IG-DMR have been reported by generating knockout mice , molecular details of the regulatory mechanisms are not fully understood as the specific sequence ( s) of IG-DMR have not been identified. Here , we generated mutant mice by deleting a 216-bp tandem repeated sequence in IG-DMR , which comprised seven repeats of 24-bp motifs , by genome editing technologies. The mutant mice showed that paternal transmission of the deletion allele , but not maternal transmission , induces severe growth retardation and perinatal lethality , possibly due to placental defects. Embryos with a paternally transmitted deletion allele showed biallelic expression of maternally expressed genes and repression of paternally expressed genes. DNA methylation status also showed loss of methylation at IG-DMR and Gtl2-DMR , indicating that the tandem repeat sequence of IG-DMR is one of the functional sequences of IG-DMR , which is required for maintaining DNA methylation imprints of paternal allele at IG-DMR.
