 In this review we discuss the recent advances in the construction of discrete , self-assembled architectures in water , a field that has gained significant interest in recent years because of the wide range of applications that arises from their well-defined 3D structure. We jointly discuss the efforts undertaken by supramolecular chemists and biotechnologists who previously worked independently to overcome discipline-specific challenges associated with construction of assemblies from synthetic and bio-derived components , respectively. We propose that going forward a more interdisciplinary research approach will expedite development of both synthetic and bio-derived complexes with real-world applications that exploit the benefits of compartmentalisation. In support of this , we summarise advances made in the development of discrete , water-soluble architectures , paying particular attention to their current and prospective applications. We also highlight keys areas where understanding and methodologies developed in the field of synthetic supramolecular chemistry can be integrated into the field of biotechnology and vice versa , in anticipation this will yield advances not possible from either field alone.
