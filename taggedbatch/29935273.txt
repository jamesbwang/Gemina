 Our objective was to assess the prevalence of intraoperative cyst<symptom> rupture ( CR) and its impact on oncological outcomes. All patients who underwent PN for a cystic renal masse through an open ( OPN) or robot-assisted ( RAPN) approach at eight academic institutions were included in a retrospective study. All operative reports were carefully reviewed and any description of cyst<symptom> rupture , cyst<symptom> effraction or local spillage intraoperatively was recorded as CR. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the variables associated with CR. Recurrence-free survival ( RFS) , cancer-specific survival ( CSS) and overall survival ( OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Overall , 268 patients were included. There were 50 intraoperative CR in the whole cohort ( 18.7 %). No preoperative parameter was significantly associated with the risk of intraoperative CR in univariate or in multivariate analysis. 75 % of cystic renal masses were malignant on final pathology. After a median follow-up of 32 months , five patients had a local recurrence ( 2.5 %) , progression to metastasis was observed in 2 % , and there were no peritoneal carcinomatosis nor port-site metastases. There were no local or metastatic recurrences in the sub-group of intraoperative CR. Estimated RFS did not differ significantly between patients with vs. without intraoperative CR ( Estimated 5-year RFS: 100 % vs. 92.7 %; p = 0.20) CONCLUSION: Intraoperative CR during partial nephrectomy is a relatively common occurence but with little oncological implications.
