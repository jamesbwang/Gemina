 To examine sex differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic vascular disease. Cox models were used to analyse the association between sex and outcomes in the Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin ( TECOS) , a randomized , placebo-controlled trial assessing the impact of sitagliptin on cardiovascular ( CV) outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic vascular disease. A total of 4297 women and 10 374 men were followed for a median of 3.0 years. Women were slightly older and more often had cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial disease but less often coronary heart disease than men. At baseline , women were less likely to use aspirin or statins. The primary composite outcome of CV death , myocardial infarction , stroke , or hospitalization for unstable angina occurred in 418 women ( 9.7 %) and 1272 men ( 12.3 %; 3.48 vs 4.38 events/100 participant-years , crude hazard ratio ( HR) 0.79 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.71-0.89 , adjusted HR 0.64 , 95 % CI 0.55-0.74; P < .0001). Women also had a significantly lower risk of secondary CV outcomes and all-cause death. In this large prospective study of people with type 2 diabetes and CV disease , women had different CV disease burden , worse CV risk factor profiles , and less use of indicated medications than men. Despite this , women had significantly lower risk of CV events , suggesting that the cardioprotective effects of female sex extend to populations with type 2 diabetes.
