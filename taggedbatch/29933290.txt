 To systematically evaluate the literature regarding vulvodynia treatment outcome measures. A systematic literature search on OVID , PubMed , and PsycINFO databases was conducted from inception until May 2016. Studies were included/excluded based on prespecified criteria. Reported outcome measures were organized into 6 core outcome domains recommended by the Initiative on Methods , Measurement , and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials ( IMMPACT): pain; physical functioning , emotional functioning , participant ratings of global improvement and satisfaction with treatment , symptoms and adverse events , and participant disposition. Of the 206 articles identified for full-text screening , 33 met our criteria. One study adhered to all IMMPACT recommendations. The number of outcomes measured per study ranged from 1 to greater than 20. Patient-reported pain outcomes were found in the majority ( 27/33; 82 %) of studies. Pain severity with intercourse was reported by 24 ( 73 %) of 33 studies-9 different scales were used to measure this outcome. Clinician-reported outcomes were present in 14 ( 42 %) of 33 studies. Methods of measuring vestibular sensitivity by `` cotton swab '' test were different in 8 of 10 studies. Other domains reported included; physical function ( 8/33 studies; 24 %) , sexual function ( 23/33 studies; 70 %) , and emotional function ( 13/33 studies; 39 %). Symptoms and adverse events were reported by 15 ( 45 %) of 33 studies. One study formally reported participant disposition using all the information recommended by CONSORT. Comparison of clinical trial results in vulvodynia is not possible because of a lack of standard treatment outcome measures. Vulvodynia researchers should apply the IMMPACT criteria to guide the development of a minimum core set of standard outcome measures that measure holistic health.
