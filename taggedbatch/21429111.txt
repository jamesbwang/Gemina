 The genetic variability and population structure of three Bhutanese traditional horse breeds were assessed through genotyping of 74 horses ( Boeta 25 , Sharta 14 and Yuta 35) for 29 microsatellite DNA loci. Altogether , 282 alleles were detected across 29 polymorphic loci. The allelic diversity ( NE) ( Boeta 4.94; Sharta 4.65; Yuta 5.30) and gene diversities ( HE) ( Boeta 0.78; Sharta 0.77; Yuta 0.79) were high. None of the breeds deviated significantly from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no sign of significant population bottleneck for all the breeds. The inbreeding estimates ( FIS) of the breeds were low ( Boeta 0.023; Sharta 0.001; Yuta 0.021). Analysis of molecular variance showed 0.6 % of the total genetic variation among breeds , 1.9 % among individuals and 97.5 % within individuals. The global FIT , FST , and FIS estimates for the population were 0.025 , 0.006 and 0.019 respectively. The analysis of population structure failed to distinguish subpopulations in traditional horses and this was supported by a high genetic exchange among the breeds. Overall , the results of this study suggest a rich genetic diversity in the traditional horse despite a very low genetic differentiation among the breeds in Bhutan.
