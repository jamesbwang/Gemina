 Animal cloning is a promising technology for biodiversity conservation , and its success depends on the recovery of nucleus donor cells. Specifically for collared peccaries , found sometimes in regions that are difficult to access , the storage at 4-6 °C of skin tissues would be an alternative for the conservation of genetic material. Therefore , we aimed to evaluate different storage periods and the presence of a nutrient medium at 4-6 °C on the recovery of somatic cells from the skin of collared peccaries. To analyze cell recovery rates , ear explants were distributed in non-refrigerated samples and samples refrigerated for 10 , 30 , and 50 d in the absence or presence of nutrient medium. All explants were analyzed by histologically and cultured. Only the fragments stored for 50 d without medium showed an increase in the total thickness of skin. Moreover , increased storage period , regardless of the presence of medium , increased the halo number and reduced the metabolic activity. After culture , only the fragments stored without medium for 50 d did not yield any somatic cells. Cells recovered from explants stored for 10 d showed similar characteristics to these recovered from non-refrigerated explants , regardless of the presence of medium , including the day at which explants achieved attachment and the total time to reach subconfluence. In conclusion , viable cells can be recovered from somatic tissues of collared peccaries stored for up to 50 d in the presence of medium , and tissues refrigerated for up to 10 d in the presence of medium yielded more viable cells.
