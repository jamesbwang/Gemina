 Radiologic findings are important in narrowing differential diagnosis. This becomes imperative in unusual presentation of diseases. An uncommon finding on lung imaging is Cheerios signs. It is described as lesions<symptom> with hypodense center and noticeable rim. These lesions<symptom> are associated with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma representing lepidic growth. We present a case of rapidly worsening shortness breath and cough<symptom>. Initial computed tomography scan of the chest showed cystic lesions<symptom> on ground glass background in both lungs. Extensive workup for inflammatory , infectious , or connective tissue disorders was unremarkable. The biopsy of lung lesions<symptom> pointed at lung metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma. Our case focuses on the benefit of imaging findings , as metastatic lesions<symptom> can mimic the presentation of that of other lung diseases.
