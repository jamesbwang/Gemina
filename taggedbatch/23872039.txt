 Cryo electron microscopy facilities running multiple instruments and serving users with varying skill levels need a robust and reliable method for benchmarking both the hardware and software components of their single particle analysis workflow. The workflow is complex , with many bottlenecks existing at the specimen preparation , data collection and image analysis steps; the samples and grid preparation can be of unpredictable quality , there are many different protocols for microscope and camera settings , and there is a myriad of software programs for analysis that can depend on dozens of settings chosen by the user. For this reason , we believe it is important to benchmark the entire workflow , using a standard sample and standard operating procedures , on a regular basis. This provides confidence that all aspects of the pipeline are capable of producing maps to high resolution. Here we describe benchmarking procedures using a test sample , rabbit muscle aldolase.
