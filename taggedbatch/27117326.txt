 Our current understanding of autism and other developmental disorders is primarily based on research conducted in high-income countries , predominantly in North<pathogen> America and Europe. Even within high-income countries , White participants are overrepresented in autism research. There is now increased recognition that a more global and diverse research representation is warranted. This paper argues that in order for global and diverse research efforts to be effective , it is essential to collaborate and engage with local experts and stakeholders , including local researchers , clinicians and representatives from governmental and non-governmental organisations. Such collaborations ensure that studies use culturally appropriate methods and materials , and that research findings are interpreted taking local context into account. Ultimately , these collaborations build local capacity and foster the development of culturally and contextually appropriate interventions that address locally perceived needs. The adage ` nothing about us without us ' is vital to global autism research.
