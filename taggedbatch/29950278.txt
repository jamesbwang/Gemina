 Frailty and multimorbidity are both strongly associated with poor health-related outcomes , including mortality. Being multimorbidity one of the major determinants of frailty , we aimed to explore whether , and to what extent , frailty without multimorbidity plays an independent role in shortening life. We used data from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen ( SNAC-K). Among the 3363 adults aged 60 + enrolled at baseline , those without multimorbidity ( i.e.: less than two chronic<disease> diseases<disease>) ( N = 1115) have been characterized according to Fried 's frailty phenotype ( i.e. robust , prefrail , and frail). The association between frailty and mortality was estimated using piecewise proportional hazard regression models in three five-year time periods. Among participants without multimorbidity , 424 ( 38 %) were prefrail and 19 ( 2 %) were frail. During the 15-year follow-up , 263 ( 24 %) participants died: 19 % , 29 % , and 63 % of those who were robust , prefrail , and frail at baseline , respectively. Within the first 5 years of follow-up , prefrail and frail participants had more than doubled mortality risk in comparison to robust ones ( HR for pre-frailty 2.08 , 95 % CI 1.15-3.76; HR for frailty 2.69 , 95 % CI 1.22-5.97). Beyond 5 years , a trend of increased mortality rate was still detectable for prefrail and frail subjects in comparison to robust ones. Physical frailty and pre-frailty are associated with short-term mortality in a cohort of older adults free from multimorbidity. Frailty could be a clinical indicator of increased risk of negative health outcomes even among subjects without multiple chronic conditions.
