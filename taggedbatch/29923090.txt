 Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA ( MPS IIIA) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease of childhood that results in early death. Post-mortem studies have been carried out on human MPS IIIA brain , but little is known about early disease development. Here , we utilised the Huntaway dog model of MPS IIIA to evaluate disease lesion<symptom> development from 2 to 24 weeks of age. A significant elevation in primarily stored heparan sulphate was observed in all brain regions assessed in MPS IIIA pups ≤ 9.5 weeks of age. There was a significant elevation in secondarily stored ganglioside ( GM3 36:1) in ≤ 9.5-week-old MPS IIIA pup cerebellum , and other brain regions also exhibited accumulation of this lipid with time. The number of neural stem cells and neuronal precursor cells was essentially unchanged in MPS IIIA dog brain ( c.f. unaffected) over the time course assessed , a finding corroborated by neuron cell counts. We observed early neuroinflammatory changes in young MPS IIIA pup brain , with significantly increased numbers of activated microglia recorded in all but one brain region in MPS IIIA pups ≤ 9.5 weeks of age ( c.f. age-matched unaffected pups). In conclusion , infant-paediatric-stage MPS IIIA canine brain exhibits substantial and progressive primary and secondary substrate accumulation , coupled with early and robust microgliosis. Whilst early initiation of treatment is likely to be required to maintain optimal neurological function , the brain 's neurodevelopmental potential appears largely unaffected by the disease process; further investigations confirming this are warranted.
