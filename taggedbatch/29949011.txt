 In the current dynamic health environment , increasing number of procedures are being completed by advanced practitioners ( nurse practitioners and physician assistants). This is the first study to assess the clinical outcomes and safety of external ventricular drain ( EVD) placements by specially trained advanced practitioners. Compare the safety and outcomes of EVD placement by advanced practitioners in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( SAH). A cohort comparison study was performed from an aneurysmal SAH database selecting patients treated with EVD from a single major academic institution in the USA between June 2007 and June 2017. Safety , accuracy , and complications of EVD placement were compared between advanced practitioners and neurosurgical physicians ( attending neurosurgeon and subspecialty clinical fellow). Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables and Ï‡ We identified 203 patients for this cohort with 238 EVD placements; eighty-seven ( 36.6 %) placements were performed by advanced practitioners and 151 ( 63.4 %) by neurosurgeons. Most of the ventriculostomies were placed in the emergency room ( n = 114; 47.9 %). Additional procedures performed concurrently with the EVD placements were significantly higher among the physicians ' group ( 21.8 vs. 4.6 %; p < 0.001). Bedside placement and usage of Ghajar guide were significantly higher among advanced practitioner 's ( 58.3 vs. 98.9 and 9.9 vs. 64.4 % , respectively , with a p < 0.001 for both). There were , however , no significant differences in terms of the number of attempts for insertion , intraprocedural complications , tract hemorrhages<symptom> , accuracy , infection rates , catheter dislodgments , and need for repositioning/replacement of EVD. After appropriate training , EVD placement can be safely performed by advanced practitioners with an adequate accuracy of placement.
