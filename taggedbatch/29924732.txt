 The European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine ( EFLM) has initiated many harmonization activities in all phases of the examination process. The EFLM is dealing with both the scientific and the educational aspects of harmonization , with the intention of disseminating best practice in laboratory medicine throughout Europe. Priorities have been given ( 1) to establish a standard for conducting and assessing biological variation studies and to construct an evidence based EFLM webpage on biological variation data , ( 2) to harmonize preanalytical procedures by producing European guidelines , ( 3) to improve test ordering and interpretation , ( 4) to produce other common European guidelines for laboratory medicine and play an active part in development of clinical guidelines , ( 5) to establish a common basis for communicating laboratory results to patients , ( 6) to harmonize units of measurement throughout Europe , ( 7) to harmonize preanalytical procedures in molecular diagnostics and ( 8) to harmonize and optimize test evaluation procedures. The EFLM is also now launching the 5th version of the European Syllabus to help the education of European Specialists in Laboratory Medicine ( EuSpLM) , which is being supported by the development of e-learning courses. A register of EuSpLM is already established for members of National Societies in EU countries , and a similar register will be established for specialists in non-EU countries.
