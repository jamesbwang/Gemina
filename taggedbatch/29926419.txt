 Cell plasma membrane gangliosides content and pattern is finely regulated by a complex metabolic machinery. Among different pathways , past and new evidence suggests an important role of the sphingolipid catabolic enzymes associated with both lysosomes and plasma membrane. Over the years , several cell-free and cell-based assays are developed in order to evaluate the activities both intracellularly and at the cell surface. Here , we propose a selection of the most efficient , sensitive , and specific assays that allow determining the activity of the main gangliosides-glycohydrolases such as sialidases , ß-hexosaminidases , ß-galactosidases , and ß-glucosidases in both cell/tissue lysates and directly in living cells.
