 In this work interfaces between ( Na2O) x ( SiO2) 1-x glasses ( for x = 0.0 , 0.1 and 0.2) and TiO2 crystals are simulated using molecular dynamics and empirical potentials. Interfaces are presented for the distinct terminating surfaces of TiO2 with Miller indices â‰¤ 2 , the properties of which have been investigated using atomistic models. Simulations showed that partially ordered layers had been induced in the glass close to the interfaces , with successive oxygen-rich and cation-rich planes being noted. The first silicate layer in contact with the crystal tended to be highly-structured , with Si ions occupying well-defined positions that depend on the orientation of the crystal at the interface , and showing 2-dimensional ordering depending on glass composition. Finally , interface energies were calculated. These indicated that the interface formation may stabilise a crystal surface in comparison to maintaining a free surface. Results are presented suggesting that the structural flexibility of the glass network allows it to conform to the crystal , thereby providing charge compensation and avoiding large relaxation of the crystal structure close to the interfaces. Such interfacial properties could be crucial to improving phenomenological models of glass-crystal composite properties.
