 Simulation-based training ( SBT) for pediatric trauma resuscitation can improve team performance. The purpose of this study was to describe the nationwide trend in SBT use and barriers to SBT implementation. Trauma centers that participated in ACS TQIP Pediatric in 2016 ( N = 125) were surveyed about SBT use. Center characteristics and reported implementation barriers were compared between centers using and not using SBT. Survey response rate was 75 % ( 94/125) with 78 % ( 73/94) reporting SBT use. The frequency of pediatric SBT use increased from 2014 to 2016 ( median 5.5 vs 6.5 annual sessions , p < 0.01). Funding barriers were negatively associated with number of annual SBT sessions ( r â‰¤ -0.34 , p < 0.05). Centers not using SBT reported lack of technical expertise ( p = 0.01) and lack of data supporting SBT ( p = 0.03) as significant barriers. Simulation use increased from 2014 to 2016 , but significant barriers to implementation exist. Strategies to share resources and decrease costs may improve usage. Level 3 , epidemiological.
