 In Focus: Weimerskirch , H. ( 2018). Linking demographic processes and foraging ecology in wandering albatross-Conservation implications. Journal of Animal Ecology , 87 , 945-955. https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12817 Long-term individual-based studies are extremely valuable resources to study how life histories are shaped by selection on between-individual variation in the acquisition and allocation of resources. In this issue , Weimerskirch ( 2018) synthesises a 50-year study , uniquely including 20 years of individual-based movement tracking , of the majestic wandering albatross. The synthesis shows how variation in foraging distribution and efficiency in relation to sex and age is reflected in physiology , fitness and population dynamics , and how understanding of such patterns and processes can aid conservation efforts. It thereby exemplifies why long-term individual-based studies are especially productive and informative and require maintenance and safeguarding.
