 Nasal airway obstruction ( NAO) is a common otolaryngic complaint with many potential causes , frequently structural or inflammatory in nature. Patients typically have multiple coexisting factors leading to symptoms. Good patient outcomes require careful preoperative evaluation , including nasal endoscopy , to accurately identify sources of obstruction and tailor intervention appropriately. Common structural causes of NAO include inferior turbinate hypertrophy , nasal septal deviation , and narrowing or collapse of the internal or external nasal valves. The internal nasal valve has the narrowest cross-sectional area within the nasal airway and is thus most sensitive to changes in dimension due to anatomic variation or surgical intervention.
