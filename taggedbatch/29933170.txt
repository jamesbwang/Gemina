 Protein complexes are characterised by shape complementarity at the interface. Here we present a simple fast global shape fitting algorithm to investigate the extent to which interfaces are global minima of complementarity. The algorithm is applied to a varied set of hetero and homo complexes and complexes between complexes showing that over 90 % of large interfaces are global maxima in the space of shape complementarity.
