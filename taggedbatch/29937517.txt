 Over the past decades , extensive efforts have been devoted to modulating the textural properties , morphology and microstructure of & gamma;- Al ₂ O ₃ , since the physiochemical properties of & gamma;- Al ₂ O ₃ have close correlations with the performance of hydrotreating catalysts. In this work , a spongy mesoporous & gamma;- alumina ( & gamma;- Al ₂ O ₃) was synthesized using Al-based metal-organic frameworks ( Al-MOFs) as precursor by two-step pyrolysis , and this Al-MOF-derived & gamma;- Al ₂ O ₃ was used as hydrodesulfurization ( HDS) catalyst support , to explore the effect of support on the HDS performance. Compared with industrial & gamma;- Al ₂ O ₃ , the spongy alumina displayed well-developed porosity with relatively high surface area , large pore volume , and abundant weak Lewis acid sites. Based on catalyst characterization and performance evaluation , sulfurized molybdenum and cobalt molecules were able to incorporate and highly disperse into channels of the spongy mesoporous alumina , increasing the dispersion of active catalytic species. The spongy & gamma;- Al ₂ O ₃ was also able to enhance the diffusion efficiency and mass transfer of reactant molecules due to its improved texture properties. Therefore , the corresponding catalyst presented higher activities toward HDS of dibenzothiophene ( DBT) than that from industrial alumina. The spongy mesoporous & gamma;- alumina synthesized by Al-MOFs provides a new alternative to further develop novel & gamma;- alumina materials with different texture and various nanoporous structures , considering the diversity of MOFs with different compositions , topological structures , and morphology.
