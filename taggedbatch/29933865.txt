 To determine the prevalence and pattern of resistance to second line drugs among multi drug resistant ( MDR) tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> patients being treated on category IV regimen. This study was conducted at Department of Respiratory Medicine , J.L.N. Medical College , Ajmer in collaboration with IRL , STDC , Ajmer. Second line anti tubercular drug sensitivity for 398 multi drug resistant tuberculosis<disease> patients ( between June-2015 and June-2016) was done to find out prevalence and pattern of resistance to second line drugs. Second line drug sensitivity was performed at accredited laboratory , Microbiology department , S.M.S. Medical College , Jaipur. Among these 398 patients , 136 ( 34.17 %) were resistant to fluoroquinolones<disease> ( Ofloxacin) ( Pre XDR); 18 ( 4.52 %) were resistant to one of the aminoglycosides ( Inj. Kanamycin , Capreomycin , Amikacin) ( Pre XDR); while 22 ( 5.53 %) patients were resistant to fluoroquinolones<disease> as well as aminoglycosides ( XDR). 148 ( 37.18 %) patients were found sensitive to both the drugs. Samples of 41 ( 10.3 %) patients were contaminated and no growth was seen in 33 ( 8.29 %) patients. Nearly half of the multi drug resistant ( MDR) tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> patients ( 44.22 %) being treated on category IV regimen also have resistance to either fluoroquinolones<disease> or aminoglycosides or both i.e. Pre XDR or XDR. This may result in poor outcome of category IV regimen under RNTCP. There is a strong need for provision of culture sensitivity for all first line drugs and at least two second line drugs viz.. Fluoroquinolones<disease> and aminoglycosides for all the patients registered as smear positive under RNTCP. There is also a need for development of rapid culture technique for sensitivity to second line drugs.
