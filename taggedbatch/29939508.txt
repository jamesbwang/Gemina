 To examine the association between health plan out-of-pocket ( OOP) costs for antiepileptic drugs and healthcare utilization ( HCU) and overall plan spending among US-based commercial health plan beneficiaries with epilepsy. Retrospective cohort. The Truven MarketScan Commercial Claims database for January 1 , 2009 , to June 30 , 2015 , was used. Patients 65 years or younger with epilepsy and at least 12 months of continuous enrollment before index ( date meeting first epilepsy diagnostic criteria) were included. Analyses were adjusted for age group , gender , beneficiary relationship , insurance plan type , and Charlson Comorbidity Index score. Primary outcomes included proportion of days covered ( PDC) , HCU , and healthcare spending in 90-day postindex periods. Associations between OOP costs and mean PDC , HCU , and plan healthcare spending per 90-day period were estimated. Across 5159 plans , 187,241 beneficiaries met eligibility criteria; 54.3 % were female , 41.7 % were aged 45 to 65 years , and 62.4 % were in preferred provider organization plans. Across postindex 90-day periods , mean ( SD) PDC , epilepsy-specific hospitalizations , outpatient visits , and emergency department visits were 0.85 ( 0.26) , 0.02 ( 0.13) , 0.34 ( 0.47) , and 0.05 ( 0.22) , respectively. Median ( interquartile range) spending per 90-day period was $ 1488 ( $ 459- $ 4705); median epilepsy-specific spending was $ 139 ( $ 18- $ 623). Multivariable linear regression without health plan fixed effects revealed that higher OOP spending was associated with a decrease in PDC ( coefficient , -0.008; 95 % CI , -0.009 to -0.006; P < .001) and an increase in overall spending ( 218.6; 95 % CI , 47.9-389.2; P = .012). Health plan fixed effects model estimates were similar , except for epilepsy-specific spending , which was significant ( 120.6; 95 % CI , 29.2-211.9; P = .010). Increases in beneficiaries ' OOP costs led to higher overall spending and lower PDC.
