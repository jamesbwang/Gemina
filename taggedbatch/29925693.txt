 Pathologic glomerular epithelial cell ( GEC) hyperplasia<disease> is characteristic of both rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis<disease> ( RPGN) and subtypes of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS). Although initial podocyte injury resulting in activation of STAT3 signals GEC proliferation in both diseases , mechanisms regulating this are unknown. Here , we show that the loss of Kr√ºppel-like factor 4 ( KLF4) , a zinc-finger transcription factor , enhances GEC proliferation in both RPGN and FSGS due to dysregulated STAT3 signaling. We observed that podocyte-specific knockdown of Klf4 ( C57BL/6J) increased STAT3 signaling and exacerbated crescent formation after nephrotoxic serum treatment. Interestingly , podocyte-specific knockdown of Klf4 in the FVB/N background alone was sufficient to activate STAT3 signaling , resulting in FSGS with extracapillary proliferation , as well as renal<symptom> failure<symptom> and reduced survival. In cultured podocytes , loss of KLF4 resulted in STAT3 activation and cell-cycle reentry , leading to mitotic catastrophe. This triggered IL-6 release into the supernatant , which activated STAT3 signaling in parietal epithelial cells. Conversely , either restoration of KLF4 expression or inhibition of STAT3 signaling improved survival in KLF4-knockdown podocytes. Finally , human kidney biopsy specimens with RPGN exhibited reduced KLF4 expression with a concomitant increase in phospho-STAT3 expression as compared with controls. Collectively , these results suggest the essential role of KLF4/STAT3 signaling in podocyte injury and its regulation of aberrant GEC proliferation.
