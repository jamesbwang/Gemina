 Wiring the active site of an enzyme directly to an electrode is the key to ensuring efficient electron transfer for the proper performance of enzyme-based bioelectronic systems. Iron-sulfur complexes , the first link between proteins and mediating molecules in the biological electron transport chain ( s) , possess an intrinsic electron transport capability. The authors demonstrate the application of inorganic iron-sulfur clusters ( Fe-S) viz.. FeS , FeS
