 A common germline variant in HSD3B1 ( 1245A > C) encodes for a hyperactive 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 ( 3βHSD1) missense that increases metabolic flux from extragonadal precursor steroids to DHT synthesis in prostate cancer. Enabling of extragonadal DHT synthesis by HSD3B1 ( 1245C) predicts for more rapid clinical resistance to castration and sensitivity to extragonadal androgen synthesis inhibition. HSD3B1 ( 1245C) thus appears to define a subgroup of patients who benefit from blocking extragonadal androgens. However , abiraterone , which is administered to block extragonadal androgens , is a steroidal drug that is metabolized by 3βHSD1 to multiple steroidal metabolites , including 3-keto-5α-abiraterone , which stimulates the androgen receptor. Our objective was to determine if HSD3B1 ( 1245C) inheritance is associated with increased 3-keto-5α-abiraterone synthesis in patients. First , we characterized the pharmacokinetics of 7 steroidal abiraterone metabolites in 15 healthy volunteers. Second , we determined the association between serum 3-keto-5α-abiraterone levels and HSD3B1 genotype in 30 patients treated with abiraterone acetate ( AA) after correcting for the determined pharmacokinetics. Patients who inherit 0 , 1 , and 2 copies of HSD3B1 ( 1245C) have a stepwise increase in normalized 3-keto-5α-abiraterone ( 0.04 ng/ml , 2.60 ng/ml , and 2.70 ng/ml , respectively; P = 0.002). Increased generation of 3-keto-5α-abiraterone in patients with HSD3B1 ( 1245C) might partially negate abiraterone benefits in these patients who are otherwise more likely to benefit from CYP17A1 inhibition.
