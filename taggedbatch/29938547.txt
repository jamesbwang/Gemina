 Simulation-based training ( SBT) is a revolutionary addition to the education of residents in different specialties. However , the selection of training programs is often reliant on commercially available equipment or on experiential notions , local interests or coincidence. The first step to developing training programs should be problem identification and general needs assessment to ensure that these are aligned with current trainee needs. We describe a stepwise approach to performing a needs assessment following the Delphi process and using a needs assessment formula ( NAF) to prioritize technical procedures for simulation training. This technique relies on a panel of experts to gather information and achieve a convergence of opinion. We used three rounds of survey iterations. Round 1: A brainstorming phase to gather all procedures that a newly qualified resident should be able to perform. Round 2: Rating and preliminary prioritization with a NAF including frequency of the procedure , number of doctors , impact , and feasibility. Round 3: Elimination and final prioritization of procedures. The needs assessment identifies and prioritizes procedures for simulation training. It can guide medical educators in the planning of SBT programs to address current trainee needs with the aim of improving the education and training of future doctors.
