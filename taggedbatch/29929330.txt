 This study aims to investigate the microbiological potential of the termite species Constrictotermes cyphergaster ( Silvestri , 1901) and its support plants. We collected five C. cyphergaster nests from three different support plant species. Microbiological assays were performed on these extracts using the serial microdilution method in triplicate to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC) of each microorganism for the analysed extract. The ethanol extracts of the termite C. cyphergaster showed no significant activity against strains of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and Escherichia<pathogen> coli , with an MIC > 1000 μg mL-1. Only the extracts of the nests and termites with the nest had the same MICs. These results were in contrast to the extracts of Spondias tuberosa ( Umbuzeiro) , Poincianella pyramidalis ( Catingueira) , and Amburana cearensis ( Cumaru) , which demonstrated significant activity against S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> with MICs < 1000 μg mL-1. The modulating activity of the extracts tested in the present study demonstrated potentiation of most antibiotics across the bacterial strains tested when combined with the extracts for both S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. These results indicate that the extracts tested in the present study may be composed of animal and vegetable origins with the potential to modify the activity of antibiotics and thus may aid in antimicrobial therapy.
