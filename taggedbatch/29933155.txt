 The size control of nanowindows on the graphene walls is indispensable to develop innovative adsorption and separation technologies. As single wall carbon nanohorn ( SWCNH) consists of graphene wall , the permeation of ions through the nanowindows can be evaluated with adsorption measurement. We regulated the nanowindow size by use of mild oxidation at 473-523 K for 20-70 h. The explicit low<symptom> pressure<symptom> adsorption hysteresis was observed in the N
