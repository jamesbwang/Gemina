 Gluten proteins of certain cereals ( wheat , rye and barley) can trigger hypersensitivity<disease> reactions. In special dietary products for people intolerant to gluten , their amount must not exceed the regulatory threshold levels. The source of gluten can influence gluten quantitation due to variability in protein profile of grain cultivars and species. A proper reference material is crucial for accurate measurement of gluten and evaluating assay performance. It should be as representative of the commodity as possible. In this study , protein content and composition of a set of 23 common wheat cultivars grown around the world were determined. According to qualitative and quantitative selection criteria , cultivars that possessed a typical gluten composition were identified. Five cultivars were selected for subsequent experiments to confirm their suitability as a basis for reference material production.
