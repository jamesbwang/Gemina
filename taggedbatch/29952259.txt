 The use of photodynamic therapy in cancer still remains limited , partly because of the lack of photosensitizer ( PS) specificity for the cancerous tissues. Various molecular tools are available to increase PS efficiency by targeting the cancer cell molecular alterations. The most strategies use the protein-protein interactions , e.g. monoclonal antibodies directed toward tumor antigens , such as HER2 or EGFR. An alternative could be the targeting of the tumor glycosylation aberrations , e.g. T/Tn antigens that are truncated O-glycans over-expressed in numerous tumors. Thus , to achieve an effective targeting , PS can be conjugated to molecules that specifically recognize the O-glycosylation aberrations at the cancer cell surface.
