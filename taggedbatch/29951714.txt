 To investigate the unmet supportive care needs ( SCNs) of Chinese cancer survivors and to identify factors associated with the unmet SCNs of cancer survivors. A cross-sectional survey of Chinese cancer survivors was conducted using validated scales of the Cancer Survivors Unmet Needs scale ( CaSUN) , physical symptom concerns ( Cancer Survivors Survey of Needs-CSSN subscale) , and a single-item measure of global quality of life ( QoL) perception. There were 330 participants , with a mean score of 7.1 ( 0-10) in overall QoL. The reported rate of the 19 symptom concerns ranged from 19.4 to 72.2 %. The level of unmet SCNs ( moderate and strong need) ranged from 12.1 to 59.1 %. The top five unmet needs included concerns about the cancer re-occurring ( 59.1 %) , accessing the best medical care ( 52.7 %) , accessing complementary therapy services ( 51.5 %) , changes to beliefs ( 48.2 %) , and survivor expectations ( 47.6 %). The strength of unmet SCNs was negatively correlated with participant age ( P < 0.05) , average time since diagnosis ( P < 0.05) , and overall QoL ( P < 0.01) and positively correlated with all symptom concerns ( all P < 0.001). Study findings call attention to cancer survivors ' unmet SCNs and related factors. Underscored areas in developing survivorship care included paying special attention to existential survivorship , empowering survivor management of chronic symptoms , particularly for younger survivors , as well as for survivors with poor QoL , and those with a shorter time since diagnosis. This tailored survivorship care should be developed and delivered by a multidisciplinary team to support cancer services , with a greater capacity to deliver individualized , unmet SCN-driven care to survivors.
