 We have used scanning tunneling microscopy ( STM) to elucidate the nanoscale electronic structures of graphene oxide ( GO). The unreduced GO layer was imaged using STM without reduction processes when deposited on a Au ( 111) surface covered with an octanethiolate self-assembled monolayer ( C8S-SAM). The STM image of the GO sheet exhibits a grainy structure having a thickness of about 1 nm , which is in good agreement with the previous results obtained using atomic force microscopy ( AFM). We found that the C8S-SAM suppresses the adsorption of water remaining on the substrate , which would be important to accomplish the nanoscale imaging of the unreduced GO by STM. Furthermore , we successfully detected the π and π * states localized in the GO sheet using scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( STS). The π-π * gap energy and the gap center are not uniform within the GO sheet , indicating the existence of various sizes of the sp2 domain and evidence for the local electronic doping by the substituents.
