 Glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are the active ingredients of commonly used herbicides. Active agricultural lands extend over a large part of the Veneto region ( Eastern Po Valley , Italy) and glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are widely used. Consequently , surface waters can be potentially contaminated. This study investigates the occurrence of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium as well as aminomethylphosphonic acid ( AMPA , the degradation product of glyphosate) in river water of Veneto. Eighty-six samples were collected in 2015 at multiple sampling points across the region. Samples were analyzed for the two target herbicides , AMPA as well as for other variables , including water temperature , pH , dissolved oxygen , conductivity , hardness , BOD , COD , inorganic ions , total nitrogen , total phosphorus , total suspended solids , arsenic , and lead. The average concentrations ( all samples) were 0.17 , 0.18 , and 0.10 Î¼g L
