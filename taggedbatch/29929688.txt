 The preferred treatment of clavicula midshaft fractures in adults has gone from being very conservative into surgery being frequently recommended. However , based on recent meta-analysis favorable outcome with internal fixation is not as consistent as previously reported. Probably due to a combination of indications for surgery becoming too wide and surgery being performed by a wider group of surgeons. When using plating for clavicula fractures there are several considerations to consider to improve outcome while reducing the risk for complications. Traditionally a horizontal approach along the clavicula is used as it provides good exposure. However , this incision is associated with a high risk for permanent anterior chest wall numbness that might be very disturbing for patients. A vertical incision can instead be used. Plates are traditionally placed in a superior position. An alternative can be an anterior-inferior position that allows better soft<disease> tissue coverage , less risk for hardware protrusion , longer screws can be used and the risk for damaging the underlying neurovascular bundle is reduced. Angle-stable screw-plate systems has not in a convincing way shown any benefit in clavicula fractures. In part because most patients have good bone quality where conventional screws will be sufficient.
