 The purpose of this article is to describe how a multifaceted approach to career and professional development training , focused on core competencies , student-driven programming , inter and multidisciplinary collaboration , and cultivating a community of insight and support , is being implemented by a university Public Health Career Services office with limited staff and resources and to share these practices for other public health programs to scale this approach to their own students ' needs. The design of the career and professional development training program comprised five main approaches: ( 1) one-on-one career counseling , ( 2) peer-to-peer learning workshops , ( 3) community partnerships and experiential opportunities , ( 4) student-driven programming , and ( 5) accessible training and digital resources. All programs were tracked to gauge participation and to assess effectiveness. Noteworthy findings from program evaluations include ( 1) a large increase in student confidence levels in professionalism topics , from all of the school 's departments; ( 2) benefits of student-driven programming and peer-to-peer learning , and ( 3) importance of employer and alumni engagement. Rather than use an optional participation model , it is recommended that a cohort model or mandatory participation be implemented as the opportunity to build on curriculum is vital.
