 Antiulcer potency and inhibitory effects on Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> of structurally defined low molecular weight modified pectin from turmeric ( MTrPP) has been previously demonstrated by us. Given that ulcer<disease><symptom> is a disorder characterized by inflammatory responses leading to initiation , aggravation and perpetuation of disease conditions , the present study aims to understand the possible anti-inflammatory mechanisms through which MTrPP delivered antiulcer effects. Rats triggered with early phase gastric inflammation<symptom> ( LPS) followed by ulcer<disease><symptom> induction ( swim-stress) were pretreated with MTrPP ( 150 mg/kg b.w.) for 14 days. Inflammation<symptom> and ulcer-specific markers were screened to assess the protective effects. MTrPP offered up to 91 % protection by limiting the production of pro-inflammatory factors ( TNF-α , IL-8 , NF-κB) and by the tight differential regulation of cyclooxygenase ( COX-1 , 2) , mitogen-activated-protein-kinase ( p-p38 , p-ERK-1/ 2) and matrix metalloproteinase ( pro-MMP-9). MTrPP showed modulatory effects through inhibition of galectin-3 , oxidative stress , H
