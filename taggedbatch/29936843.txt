 Electrical properties of DNA critically depend on the way DNA molecules are integrated within the electronics , particularly on DNA-electrode immobilization strategies. Here , we show that the rate of electron transport in DNA duplexes spacer-free tethered to gold via the adenosine terminal region ( a dA
