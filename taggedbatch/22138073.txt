 A synthetic 8-mer , amphipathic , trans-acting poly-2 '- O-methyluridylic thiophosphate triester RNA element ( 2 '- OMeUtaPS) can be prepared using solid-phase synthesis protocols. 2 '- OMeUtaPS efficiently mediates the delivery of uncharged polyA-tailed phosphorodiamidate morpholino ( PMO) sequences in HeLa pLuc 705 cells , as evidenced by flow cytometry measurements. In this cell line , 2 '- OMeUtaPS-mediated transfection of an antisense polyA-tailed PMO sequence induces alternative splicing of an aberrant luciferase pre-mRNA splice site , leading to restoration of functional luciferase , as quantitatively measured using a typical luciferase assay. 2 '- OMeUtaPS is also potent at delivering an uncharged antisense polyA-tailed PMO sequence in muscle cells of the mdx mouse model of muscular dystrophy; targeting the polyA-tailed PMO sequence against a splice site of the pre-mRNA encoding mutated dystrophin triggers an alternate splicing event that results in excision of the mutated exon ( exon 23) from the pre-mRNA and production of functional dystrophin , as demonstrated by agarose gel electrophoresis.
