 Mobile learning ( mLearning) devices ( such as tablets and smartphones) are increasingly part of the clinical environment but there is a limited and somewhat conflicting literature regarding the impact of such devices in the clinical learning environment. This study aims to: assess the impact of mLearning devices in the clinical learning environment on medical students ' studying habits , attitudes towards mobile device supported learning; and the perceived reaction of clinicians and patients to the use of these devices as part of learning in the clinical setting. Over three consecutive academic years , 18 cohorts of medical students ( total n = 275) on a six-week rotation at a large teaching hospital in London were supplied with mLearning devices ( iPad mini<pathogen>) to support their placement-based learning. Feedback on their experiences and perceptions was collected via pre- and post-use questionnaires. The results suggest mLearning devices have a positive effect on the students ' perceived efficiency of working , while experience of usage not only confirmed pre-existing positive opinions about devices but also disputed some expected limitations associated with mLearning devices in the clinical workplace. Students were more likely to use devices in ` down-time ' than as part of their clinical learning. As anticipated , both by users and from the literature , universal internet access was a major limitation to device use. The results were inconclusive about the student preference for device provision versus supporting a pre-owned device. M-learning devices can have a positive impact on the learning experiences medical students during their clinical attachments. The results supported the feasibility of providing mLearning devices to support learning in the clinical environment. However , universal internet is a fundamental limitation to optimal device utilisation.
