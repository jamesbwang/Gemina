 So far , the concept of remote ischaemic preconditioning ( RIPC) failed its translation from experimental to clinical studies. In addition to our Cochrane Systematic Review , we systematically assessed the use of the intravenous anaesthetic propofol , as a potential confounding factor. We searched CENTRAL , MEDLINE , Embase and Web of Science. We included randomised controlled trials comparing RIPC with no RIPC in adult patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( with or without valve surgery) receiving either exclusively propofol or exclusively volatile anaesthetics. Two authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. We report odds ratios ( ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) as our summary statistics are based on random-effects models. We included 14 studies involving 4060 participants. We found no difference in treatment effect between the propofol and volatile anaesthetic groups when RIPC or no RIPC is applied on a composite endpoint ( all-cause mortality , non-fatal myocardial infarction and/or any new stroke) , all-cause mortality , non-fatal myocardial infarction , stroke , or length of stay on ICU. On cardiac markers , RIPC did show a treatment effect on cardiac troponin T measured as AUC 72 hours ( SMD -0.80 , CI -1.34 , -0.25) in the propofol group. However , these findings have to be interpreted with great caution , to date only a very limited number of patients received volatile anaesthetics in RIPC trials ( minimum n = 15 , maximum n = 232). Present data do not permit a final assessment regarding the role of volatile or intravenous anaesthetics as a possible confounding factor in RIPC trials.
