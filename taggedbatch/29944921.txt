 Nuclear receptors ( NRs) are a family of ligand-dependent transcription factors activated by lipophilic compounds. NRs share a common structure comprising three domains: a variable N-terminal domain ( NTD) , a highly conserved globular DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain. There are numerous papers describing the molecular details of the latter two globular domains. However , very little is known about the structure-function relationship of the NTD , especially as an intrinsically disordered fragment of NRs that may influence the molecular properties and , in turn , the function of globular domains. Here , we investigated whether and how an intrinsically disordered NTD consisting of 58 amino acid residues affects the functions of the globular domains of the Ultraspiracle protein from Helicoverpa armigera ( HaUsp). The role of the NTD was examined for two well-known and easily testable NR functions , i.e. , interactions with specific DNA sequences and dimerization. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the intrinsically disordered NTD influences the interaction of HaUsp with specific DNA sequences , apparently by destabilization of HaUsp-DNA complexes. On the other hand , multi-angle light scattering and sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that the NTD acts as a structural element that stabilizes HaUsp homodimers. Molecular models based on small-angle X-ray scattering indicate that the intrinsically disordered NTD may exert its effects on the tested HaUsp functions by forming an unexpected scorpion-like structure , in which the NTD bends towards the ligand-binding domain in each subunit of the HaUsp homodimer. This structure may be crucial for specific NTD-dependent regulation of the functions of globular domains in NRs.
