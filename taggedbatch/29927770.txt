 The hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> delta<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HDV<pathogen>) causes the most aggressive form of chronic viral hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom>. As HDV<pathogen> replication requires hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) , HDV<pathogen> screening is limited to HBsAg + carriers. To date , individuals with HDV-antibodies and markers of resolved hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> are considered cured. However , a subset shows elevated liver enzymes and hepatic fibrosis<disease>. Could they represent HBsAg-seronegative occult HDV<pathogen> infections? We tested for HDV-antibodies 406 individuals with markers of past HBV exposure. Overall , 20 ( 4.9 %) were reactive for HDV-antibodies. All were negative for serum HDV-RNA , including four with elevated liver enzymes. These results support the current policy of screening for hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> delta only in HBsAg + individuals.
