 Considering the lack of information , the effects of mild endurance exercise plus blood flow restriction ( BFR) on electrocardiographic parameters , hypertrophy index , and expression of angiotensin II receptors type 1 ( AT1R) and type 2 ( AT2R) and apelin receptor ( APJ) were assessed in hearts of old male rats. Animal were grouped as control ( CTL) , Sham ( Sh) , lower extremities blood flow restriction ( BFR) , exercise ( Ex) , Sham + exercise ( Sh + Ex) , and blood flow restriction + exercise ( BFR + Ex). Exercise plus BFR significantly decreased the corrected QT ( QTc) interval ( Mild endurance exercise plus BFR can alter the expression of angiotensin II and apelin receptors that leads to cardiac hypertrophy and improves the ventricular conductivity of aging rats.
