 Synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy , in conjunction with atomic absorption and Raman spectroscopy , was used to analyze a set of top brand tattoo inks to investigate the presence of toxic elements and hazardous substances. The Cr , Cu , and Pb contents were found to be above the maximum allowed levels established by the Council of Europe through the resolution ResAP ( 2008) 1 on requirements and criteria for the safety of tattoos and permanent makeup. Raman analysis has revealed the presence of a set of prohibited substances mentioned in ResAP ( 2008) 1 , among which are the pigments Blue 15 , Green<symptom> 7 , and Violet 23. Other pigments that were identified in white , black , red , and yellow inks are the Pigment White 6 , Carbon Black , Pigment Red 8 , and a diazo yellow , respectively. The present results show the importance of regulating tattoo ink composition.
