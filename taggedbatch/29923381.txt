 To analyse the efficiency of EX16 +10 Y kit on the forensic detection of the Uygur in Xinjiang province. The blood samples were extracted from 4 620 male individuals of Uygur in Xinjiang province , and amplified by EX16 +10 Y kit. The typing of amplification products was performed by 3130 The genotyping graphs of 15 autosomal STR loci and 10 Y-chromosomal STR loci from 4 620 male individuals of Uygur in Xinjiang province were acquired completely. The genotype distribution of 15 autosomal STR loci was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The heterozygosity , polymorphism information content and discrimination power of STR loci were 0.637-0.838 , 0.580-0.860 and 0.811-0.978 , respectively. There were 766 haplotypes in 10 Y- chromosomal STR loci. The test results of EX16 +10 Y kit is accurate and trustworthy , which can simultaneously be used for the individual identification and the screening of paternal pedigree in practical work.
