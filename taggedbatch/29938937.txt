 According to numerous studies , failures in treatment of ovarian cancer , i.e. , a relapse and metastases , result from a small population of cancer stem cells ( CSCs). They may also be responsible for tumor initiation. Cancer stem cells are resistant to chemoand radiotherapy. Eradication of CSCs may involve the application of salinomycin , metformin and Clostridium<pathogen> perfringens<pathogen><disease>; the effect of anti-angiogenic factors remains controversial. Salinomycin is an antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces<pathogen> albus<pathogen> bacteria. Its CSC-eradicating effect has been demonstrated both in ovarian cancer cell lines and in women with breast cancer. Clostridium<pathogen> perfringens<pathogen><disease> enterotoxin ( CPE) has been demonstrated to destroy CSCs in ovarian cancer both in vivo and in vitro. Metformin , apart from its hypoglycemic effect , reduces the CSC population and inhibits the proliferation of neoplastic cells and angiogenesis. Cancer stem cells with expression of VEGFR1 + have been described as affecting circulating cancer cells and influencing the formation of metastases. Both positive and negative effects of anti-angiogenic therapy on the CSC population have been documented.
