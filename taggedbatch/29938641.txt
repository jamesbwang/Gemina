 Clinical trials are important to ensure that patients and society benefit from healthcare interventions. Among the Danish public research investments in medical sciences the main part of funding is given to preclinical and translational research , and less than ten per cent is given to clinical trials. This imbalance may have negative consequences for patients and society , because public investment in clinical trials is likely to ensure broader availability of tested interventions independent of diseases , patient groups , caregivers and clinical settings.
