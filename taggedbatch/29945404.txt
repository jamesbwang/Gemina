 To explore a safe and effective method for the treatment of low<symptom> back pain in the cutaneous nerve , and to clarify the indication of Pi needle to treat it. From January 2003 to December 2004 , 278 patients with cutaneous nerve entrapment low<symptom> back pain were divided into two groups: Pi needle group and electrical stimulation group. In the Pi needle group , there were 68 males and 70 females , ranging in age from 20 to 60 years old , with an average of ( 41.92 ± 10.88) years old. In the electrical stimulation group , there were 68 males and 72 females , ranging in age from 18 to 60 years old , with an average of ( 41.44 ± 10.47) years old. The pain , tenderness<symptom> and soft<disease> tissue tension of the two groups were measured and compared before and after treatment. All of the selected cases were qualified. No suspension , culling and shedding cases occurred in either group. In Pi needle group , visual analog scale ( VAS) of pain decreased from 8.78 ± 1.52 before treatment to 1.33 ± 1.33 after treatment; and in electrical stimulation group , VASof pain decreased from 8.59 ± 1.76 before treatment to 5.20 ± 2.64 after treatment; and the VAS of pain of the Pi needle group was lower than that of the electrical stimulation group. In Pi needle group , VAS of tenderness<symptom> decreased from 9.12 ± 1.24 before treatment to 1.60 ± 1.36 after treatment; and in electrical stimulation group , VAS of pain decreased from 8.79 ± 1.60 before treatment to 5.34 ± 2.60 after treatment; and the VAS of pain of the Pi needle group was lower than that of the electrical stimulation group. Once tissue texture changes to pain point , cord , nodules<symptom> , Pi needle is the first line treatment for the cutaneous nerve entrapment low<symptom> back pain.
