 Programmed cell death ( PCD) , or apoptosis , plays essential roles in various cellular and developmental processes , and dysregulation of apoptosis causes many diseases. Thus , regulation of apoptotic process is very important. Drosophila tankyrase ( DTNKS) is an evolutionarily conserved protein with poly ( ADP-ribose) polymerase activity. In mammalian cells , tankyrases ( TNKSs) have been reported to regulate cell death. To determine whether DTNKS plays function in inducing apoptosis in in vivo development , we used Drosophila as a model system and generated transgenic flies expressing DTNKS. We show that ectopic expression of DTNKS promotes caspase-dependent apoptosis and knockdown of DTNKS by RNAi dramatically alleviates apoptotic defect caused by ectopic expression of pro-apoptotic protein hid or rpr in the adult eye. Moreover , our result shows that ectopic expression of DTNKS triggers the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK) signaling , which is required for DTNKS-mediated apoptosis. Taken together , our finding identifies the role of DTNKS in regulating apoptosis by activating JNK signaling in Drosophila.
