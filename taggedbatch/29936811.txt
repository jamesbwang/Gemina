 Microscopic fungi<pathogen> can be present on a variety of foodstuff , including cheese. They can be responsible for fungal spoilage , causing sensory<symptom> changes<symptom> making food unacceptable for human consumption , and posing severe health concerns. Furthermore , some of these organisms are able to resist antimicrobial preservatives provided for by law. Antifungal activity of 15 chemically defined EOs , alone and in mixture , were checked by a microdilution test against isolates of Penicillium funiculosum and Mucor<pathogen> racemosus<pathogen> cultured from rinds of Marzolino , a typical Italian fresh pecorino cheese. Origanum vulgare yielded the lowest MIC values , followed by <i> Salvia sclarea </i> , <i> Ocimum basilicum </i> and <i> Cymbopogon citratus </i> , while <i> Citrus paradisi </i> and <i> Citrus limon </i> were not active. All mixtures showed antifungal activity at lower concentration with respect to MIC values of each EO component , when not in combination. This study is the first to describe the setting up of EOs mixtures to limit spoiling moulds.
