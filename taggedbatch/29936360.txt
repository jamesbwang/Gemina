 Video image recognition has been extensively studied with rapid progress recently. However , most methods focus on short-term rather than long-term ( contextual) video recognition. Convolutional recurrent neural networks ( ConvRNNs) provide robust spatio-temporal information processing capabilities for contextual video recognition , but require extensive computation that slows down training. Inspired by normalization and detrending methods , in this paper we propose `` adaptive detrending '' ( AD) for temporal normalization in order to accelerate the training of ConvRNNs , especially of convolutional gated recurrent unit ( ConvGRU). For each neuron in a recurrent neural network ( RNN) , AD identifies the trending change within a sequence and subtracts it , removing the internal covariate shift. In experiments testing for contextual video recognition with ConvGRU , results show that ( 1) ConvGRU clearly outperforms feed-forward neural networks , ( 2) AD consistently and significantly accelerates training and improves generalization , ( 3) performance is further improved when AD is coupled with other normalization methods , and most importantly , ( 4) the more long-term contextual information is required , the more AD outperforms existing methods.
