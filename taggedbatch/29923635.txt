 Although therapies for advanced melanoma have been greatly improved by the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors and BRAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors , there are still many concerns about the administration of these novel drugs. Therefore , to combine these therapies sequentially at appropriate time points of the disease is important. In this report , we report two cases in which dabrafenib and trametinib therapy for advanced melanoma failed but were successfully controlled by nivolumab monotherapy , and investigated the sera sCD163 , CCL22 and CXCL10 as biomarkers for tumor progression. Interestingly , the sera levels of sCD163 , CXCL10 and CCL22 , both of which are produced by activated tumor-associated macrophages , were increased in parallel with the tumor progression in each case. Because this report presents only two cases , further data will need to be accumulated to provide more fundamental insights into the usefulness of these biomarkers for predicting disease progression in melanoma.
