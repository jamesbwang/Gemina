 Thrombomodulin ( TM , encoded by the THBD gene) expressed in vascular endothelial cells plays pivotal roles maintaining the equilibrium of coagulation and anti-coagulation. TM levels can be regulated at the transcriptional level although the epigenetic mechanism is underexplored. Here we report that transcriptional activation of TM in both immortalized vascular endothelial cells ( EAhy926) and primary human aortic endothelial cells ( HAEC) by all-trans retinoic acid ( RA) paralleled accumulation of trimethylated histone H3K4 , a prominent marker for active chromatin , surrounding the THBD promoter. RA treatment up-regulated the expression of SETD1A ( SET1) , a dedicated H3K4 methyltransferase , and augmented SETD1A occupancies on the THBD promoter. Further analysis revealed that the sequence-specific transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 4 ( KLF4) interacted with and recruited SETD1A to the THBD promoter. Interestingly , SETD1A was recruited to the KLF4 promoter by retinoic acid receptor ( RAR) and mediated the up-regulation of KLF4 expression by RA stimulation. In summary , our data illustrate a previously unrecognized pathway in which SETD1A contributes to RA-induced TM expression in vascular endothelial cells by modulating the activity and expression of KLF4.
