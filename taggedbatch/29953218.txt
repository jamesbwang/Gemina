 A simple yet versatile solution-based process to produce colloidal silica hexapods is developed in which various shapes of silica rods are grown on the faces of cubes in a controlled manner. In the presence of hematite cubic particles , water droplets nucleate on the surface of hematite by phase separation in pentanol. By adjusting the water concentration , six droplets can form on each face of the hematite cube. A silica precursor is then administered into the system , which gradually diffuses into the water droplets through the oil phase. Within the droplets , hydrolysis and condensation of the precursors take place , leading to formation of silica rods. As a result , silica hexapods on a magnetic hematite cubic seed are produced. Furthermore , when the emulsions are aged at 60 Â°C prior to the silica growth , the water content in the solution decreases gradually due to evaporation and spiky sharp hexapods are produced. On the other hand , when organosilane precursor is added , pancake-like hexapods are formed due to the reduction of interfacial tension. These colloidal hexapods can further be utilized as new building blocks for self-assembly to construct functional materials or as a model system to understand collective behaviors.
