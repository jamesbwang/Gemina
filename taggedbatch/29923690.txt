 Anthranilic diamides is a class of insecticides target at ryanodine receptors ( RyRs). To discover potent insecticides targeting at RyRs , a series of novel anthranilic diamides with a diacylhydrazine bridge were designed and synthesized. Their insecticidal activities were evaluated and a preliminary structure-activity relationship ( SAR) was summarized. In particular , compound 5g exhibited good lethality against oriental armyworm ( Mythimna separata) at a concentration of 5 mg/L. The calcium imaging experimental results indicated that the compound 5g can serve as effective insect Ca
