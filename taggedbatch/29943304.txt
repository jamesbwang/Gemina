 Functional genomics aims to develop an in-depth understanding of how specific gene dysfunctions are related to diseases. A common method for investigating the genome and its complex functions is via perturbation of the interactions between the DNA , RNA and their protein respective protein derivatives. Commonly , arrayed and pooled genetic screens are utilized to achieve this and in recent years have been fundamental in achieving the current level of understanding for gene dysfunctions. However , they are limited in specific aspects which scientists have attempted to address. Clustered regularly palindromic repeats ( CRISPR)- based methods for genetic screens have in recent years become more prevalent but crucially shared similar properties to previous methods and failing to provide a distinct advantage over previous methods. CROP-seq , Perturb-seq , and CRISPR-seq have combined CRISPR and single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq) and is the newest addition to the geneticist 's arsenal , providing scientists with methods to edit DNA with improved speed , accuracy , and efficiency which could usher us into a new era of study methods for functional genomics. We briefly overview the CRISPR-Cas9 systems , the evolution of genetic screening in recent years , and evaluate and discuss the significance of CROP-seq , Perturb-seq , and CRISPR-seq.
