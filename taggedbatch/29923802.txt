 Field trials were conducted at two locations in Florida to evaluate transgenic tomatoes expressing the EFR gene from Arabidopsis thaliana , the Bs2 gene from pepper , or both Bs2/EFR for managing bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia<pathogen> solanacearum and bacterial spot caused by Xanthomonas<pathogen> perforans. Expression of EFR or Bs2/EFR , in the susceptible genotype , Fla. 8000 , significantly reduced bacterial wilt incidence ( 50-100 %) and increased total yield ( 57-114 %) relative to lines expressing only Bs2 or non-transformed Fla. 8000 control , although the marketable yield was not significantly affected. Following harvest , surviving symptomatic and non-symptomatic plants were assessed for colonization by R. solanacearum. There were no significant differences in the population at the lower stem. Interestingly , in the middle stem , no bacteria could be recovered from EFR or Bs2/EFR lines , but viable bacterial populations were recovered from Bs2 and non-transformed control lines at 10
