 Automated attachment of chemotherapeutic drugs to oligonucleotides through phosphoramidite chemistry and DNA synthesis has emerged as a powerful technology in constructing structure-defined and payload-tunable oligonucleotide-drug conjugates. In practice , however , in vivo delivery of these oligonucleotides remains a challenge. Inspired by the systemic transport of hydrophobic payloads by serum albumin in nature , we report the development of a lipid-conjugated floxuridine homomeric oligonucleotide ( LFU20) that `` hitchhikes '' with endogenous serum albumin for cancer chemotherapy. Upon intravenous injection , LFU20 immediately inserts into the hydrophobic cave of albumin to form an LFU20/albumin complex , which accumulates in the tumor by the enhanced permeability and retention ( EPR) effect and internalizes into the lysosomes of cancer cells. After degradation , cytotoxic floxuridine monophosphate is released to inhibit cell proliferation.
