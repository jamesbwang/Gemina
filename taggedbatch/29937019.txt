 The ability of ultrasound to identify specific features relevant to nonoperative management of pediatric appendicitis<disease><symptom> , such as the presence of complicated appendicitis<disease><symptom> ( CA) or an appendicolith , is unknown. Our objective was to determine the reliability of ultrasound in identifying these features. We performed a retrospective study of children who underwent appendectomy after an ultrasound at four children 's hospitals. Imaging , operative , and pathology reports were reviewed. Sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( PPV) , and negative predictive value ( NPV) of ultrasound for identifying CA based on pathology and intraoperative findings and an appendicolith based on pathology were calculated. CA was defined as a perforation of the appendix. Equivocal ultrasounds were considered as not indicating CA. Of 1027 patients , 77.5 % had simple appendicitis<disease><symptom> , 16.2 % had CA , 5.4 % had no evidence of appendicitis<disease><symptom> , and 15.6 % had an appendicolith. Sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for detecting CA based on pathology were 42.2 % and 90.4 %; the PPV and NPV were 45.8 % and 89.0 % , respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for detecting CA based on intraoperative findings were 37.3 % and 92.7 %; the PPV and NPV were 63.4 % and 81.4 % , respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for detecting an appendicolith based on pathology were 58.1 % and 78.3 %; the PPV and NPV were 33.1 % and 91.0 % , respectively. Results were similar when equivocal ultrasound and negative appendectomies were excluded. The high specificity and NPV suggest that ultrasound is a reliable test to exclude CA and an appendicolith in patients being considered for nonoperative management of simple appendicitis<disease><symptom>.
