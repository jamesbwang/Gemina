 The purpose of the present study was to search for associations between spontaneous preterm birth ( sPTB) , single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) associated with the apoptotic pathway as triggered by oxidative stress , maternal lifestyle and health status. SNP genotyping ( rs7560 for c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK) , rs9517320 for mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 3 ( MST3) , rs1049216 for caspase 3 ( CASP3)) in the placenta and maternal blood of 300 controls with at-term birth and 43 cases of sPTB was performed. No association was identified in genotype frequencies or combinations of foetal/maternal genotypes between single SNPs and sPTB. The risk of sPTB was significantly reduced by physical activity and significantly increased by current hypertensive diseases , premature rupture of membranes<symptom> ( PROM) or preterm PROM ( P-PROM) and previous sPTB. The TT/GA genotype of JNK/CASP3 in maternal blood and maternal health status ( current hypertensive diseases , current PROM/P-PROM , previous sPTB) were independently associated with sPTB. The present findings suggested that , independently of other maternal factors , pregnant women carrying the TT/GA genotype of JNK/CASP3 were more susceptible to sPTB than women bearing the GT/GA ( our reference) genotype; that the apoptotic pathway triggered by oxidative stress was involved; and that genetic and non-genetic factors contributed to sPTB. Knowledge of these aspects may aid to improve the management of pregnancies by indicating the lifestyle to be adopted on the basis of sPTB susceptibility.
