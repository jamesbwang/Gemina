 Adipose-derived stem cells ( ASCs) have been shown to enhance wound<disease><symptom> healing by human dermal fibroblasts; however , the interactions between ASCs and fibroblasts during injury remain unclear. Fibroblasts were treated with ASC-conditioned medium ( ASC-CM) with and without transforming growth factor-β1 ( TGF-β1) stimulation. Fibroblast proliferation , apoptosis , differentiation and expression of extracellular matrix genes and proteins , type I collagen , and type III collagen were measured. Also , wound-healing effect of ASC-CM was verified with in vivo animal study. ASC-CM inhibited proliferation and enhanced apoptosis of fibroblasts under TGF-β1 stimulation. Furthermore , 10 % ASC-CM inhibited α-smooth muscle actin expression in fibroblasts , whereas 100 % ASC-CM increased collagen , especially type III , expression in fibroblasts. ASC-CM was found to contain more basic fibroblast growth factor than hepatocyte growth factor , and 100 % ASC-CM increased hepatocyte growth factor gene expression in fibroblasts. These results suggest ASCs affect fibrogenesis by dermal fibroblasts stimulated with TGF-β1 via paracrine signaling by adipocytokines present in ASC-CM. These results also suggest that higher concentrations of ASC-CM increase collagen production and inhibit fibroblast proliferation to avoid excessive fibrogenesis. We demonstrated that a lower ASC-CM concentration attenuated fibroblast differentiation. Additionally , 100 % ASC-CM significantly reduced the wound<disease><symptom> size in an in vivo wound-healing model. In this study , we provided evidence that ASCs modulate fibrogenesis by fibroblasts via paracrine signaling , suggesting that application of ASCs during wound<disease><symptom> healing may improve the quality of wound<disease><symptom> repair.
