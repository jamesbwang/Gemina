 A main advantage of PET is that it provides quantitative measures of the radiotracer concentration , but its accuracy is confounded by several factors , including attenuation , subject motion , and limited spatial resolution. Using the information from one simultaneously acquired morphological MR sequence with embedded navigators , we propose an efficient method called MR-assisted PET data optimization ( MaPET) to perform attenuation correction ( AC) , motion correction , and anatomy-aided reconstruction.
