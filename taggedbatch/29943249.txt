 Microcystin ( MCY)- producing harmful cyanobacterial blooms ( cHABs) are an annual occurrence in Lake Erie , and buoys equipped with water quality sondes have been deployed to help researchers and resource managers track cHABs. The objective of this study was to determine how well water quality sondes attached to buoys measure total algae<pathogen> and cyanobacterial biomass and water turbidity. Water samples were collected next to two data buoys in western Lake Erie ( near Gibraltar Island and in the Sandusky subbasin) throughout summers 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 to determine correlations between buoy sonde data and water sample data. MCY and nutrient concentrations were also measured. Significant ( P < 0.001) linear relationships ( R
