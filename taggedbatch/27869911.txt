 Mimicking subcellular compartments containing enzymes in organisms is considered a promising approach to substitute for missing or lost cellular functions. Inspired by the multicompartment structures of cellular architectures , we present a novel multienzyme system based on hollow hydrogel microcapsules with flexible enzymatic inverse opal particles. Benefiting from the precise operation capability of the microfluidic electrospray and the remarkable structural color marks in the inverse opal particles , we developed a multienzyme system with controllable number , type , and spatial arrangement of the encapsulated enzymes. The hydrogel shells also could improve enzyme stability against proteolysis in the system. The multienzyme system containing alcohol oxidase and catalase could act as a cascade biocatalyst and reduce alcohol levels in media , providing an alternative antidote and prophylactic for alcohol intoxication. These features indicated that our strategy provides an ideal enzyme cascade reaction system for complex biocatalysis and biomimetic functions of some organelles or organs.
