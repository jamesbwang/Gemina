 A new series of fluorene derivatives was designed and synthesized as novel retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t ( RORγt) inverse agonists utilizing a molecular hybridization approach. The new compounds 10-15 were evaluated for their RORγt activity using biochemical FRET and cellular reporter gene assays. Moreover , the inhibitory activity of the fluorene derivatives 10-15 in mouse Th17 cell differentiation assay was assessed. The hybrid compound 15 that combines both fluorene and arylsulfone moieties displayed promising RORγt activity with IC
