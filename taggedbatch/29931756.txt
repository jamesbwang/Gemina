 We present the Brain-Age Score ( BAS) as a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI)- based index for Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). We developed a fully automated framework for estimating the BAS in healthy controls ( HCs) and individuals with mild cognitive impairment ( MCI) or AD , using MRI scans. We trained the proposed framework using 385 HCs from the IXI and OASIS datasets and evaluated 146 HCs , 102 stable-MCI ( sMCI) , 112 progressive-MCI ( pMCI) , and 147 AD patients from the J-ADNI dataset. We used a correlation test to determine the association between the BAS and four traditional screening tools of AD: the Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE) , Clinical Dementia Ratio ( CDR) , Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Score ( ADAS) , and Functional Assessment Questionnaire ( FAQ). Furthermore , we assessed the association between BAS and anatomical MRI measurements: the normalized gray matter ( nGM) , normalized white matter ( nWM) , normalized cerebrospinal fluid ( nCSF) , mean cortical thickness as well as hippocampus volume. The correlation results demonstrated that the BAS is in line with traditional screening tools of AD ( i.e. , the MMSE , CDR , ADAS , and FAQ scores) as well as anatomical MRI measurements ( i.e. , nGM , nCSF , mean cortical thickness , and hippocampus volume). The BAS may be useful for diagnosing the brain atrophy level and can be a reliable automated index for clinical applications and neuropsychological screening tools.
