 The encapsulation of mRNA in nanosystems as gene vaccines for immunotherapy purposes has experienced an exponential increase in recent years. Despite the many advantages envisaged within these approaches , their application in clinical treatments is still limited due to safety issues. These issues can be attributed , in part , to liver accumulation of most of the designed nanosystems and to the inability to transfect immune cells after an intravenous administration. In this context , this study takes advantage of the known versatile properties of the oligopeptide end-modified poly ( Î²-amino esters) ( OM-PBAEs) to complex mRNA and form discrete nanoparticles. Importantly , it is demonstrated that the selection of the appropriate end-oligopeptide modifications enables the specific targeting and major transfection of antigen-presenting cells ( APC) in vivo , after intravenous administration , thus enabling their use for immunotherapy strategies. Therefore , with this study , it can be confirmed that OM-PBAE are appropriate systems for the design of mRNA-based immunotherapy approaches aimed to in vivo transfect APCs and trigger immune responses to fight either tumors or infectious<disease> diseases<disease>.
