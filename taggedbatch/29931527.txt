 The aim of our study was to analyze the oral quality of life ( QoL) in patients with urethral stricture treated with BMG by using a validated questionnaire ( OIDP). A prospective , single-arm , observational single-centre study of a cohort of patients scheduled for BMG Urethroplasty was conducted. OIDP assesses the impact of oral conditions on daily activities including an oral QoL question ( 0-10). The questionnaire was self-administered before , 3 months postoperatively and at the end of the study. Means , pre- and postoperatively , were compared. Multivariate analysis was performed to analyze the risk factors for a low quality of life ( < 8) after surgery. We included 41 patients ( 2013-2017). The mean preoperative oral QoL was 9.33 points ( SD1 .16). Preoperative mean OIDP dimensional score and global score were 0,5 ( SD: 0.02) and 0,8 %. The most frequently preoperative altered aspect was hygiene. Mean oral QoL , 3 months after surgery , was 8,56 ( SD1 .89) and OIDP dimensional score and global score were 0,67 ( SD0 .21) and 1,1 %. Mean oral QoL at the end of the study ( mean 3,12 years) was 8,50 ( SD1 .13). OIDP dimensional score and global score were 0,7 ( SD 0.16) and 1,1 %. The most frequently altered aspect at the end of the study was eating. No statistical ( p = 0.07) decrease in oral QoL was found. The increase in OIDP dimensional and global score was also not statistically significant. Neither age nor smoking , diabetes mellitus , cardiovascular morbidity , previous OIDP score , width , length of the graft , or surgery success could explain a low oral QoL alter graft harvesting. BMG harvesting is not free of problems at the donor site. Eating seems to be the most affected aspect after surgery. Nevertheless , those sequelae do not induce a reduction in oral QoL.
