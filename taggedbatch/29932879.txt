 Neutrophil to lymphocyte<symptom> ratio ( NLR) has been indicated to be an independent predictor for all-cause mortality or adverse events in a variety of diseases. However , no consistent conclusions regarding it 's relevance to patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> have been made. This meta-analysis was conducted to assess the significance of NLR in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Pubmed and Embase databases were searched for eligible studies that reported the association between NLR and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> through September 2017. The overall hazard ratio ( HR) and corresponding 95 % confidence interval ( CI) were used to assess the associations. Ten studies met the eligibility criteria and a total of 5979 heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients were included in the meta-analysis. The overall hazard ratio ( HR) for all-cause mortality was 1.28 ( 95 % CI 1.14-1.43) and the HR of renal dysfunction was 1.23 ( 95 % CI 1.07-1.41) comparing the highest with the lowest category of NLR. However , the total pooled adjusted HR for in-hospital mortality ( HR = 1.18 , 95 % CI 0.88-1.59) and rehospitalization ( HR = 2.19 , 95 % CI 0.94-5.09) were not statistically significant. A subgroup analysis showed that sample size with moderate heterogeneity may be the origin of heterogeneity in all-cause mortality. Sensitivity analysis proved the stability of results of our meta-analysis. The meta-analysis demonstrates that NLR is a predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Because the quality of the included studies varies , further well-designed studies are needed to confirm this association.
