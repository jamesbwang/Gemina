 A new molecularly imprinted polymer electrochemiluminescence ( ECL) sensor was developed for the detection of clopyralid ( CPD) based on enzyme-biocatalyzed amplification. CdTe quantum dots were immobilized on the surface of an electrode by reaction with p-aminothiophenol preadsorbed on the electrode. Then a molecularly imprinted film was formed by electrochemical polymerization of o-phenylenediamine in the presence of CPD on the CdTe-modified gold electrode. During the analytical cycle , horseradish peroxidase ( HRP)- labeled CPD was replaced by CPD in the sample. The amount of HRP on the molecularly imprinted polymer electrode decreased , and then less H
