 The purpose of this study was to compare the hormonal responses to one session of high-intensity interval training ( HIIT , 4 × 4 min intervals at 85-95 % maximum heart rate ( HRmax) , interspersed with 4 min of recovery at 75-85 % HRmax) , resistance training ( RT at 50-70 % of one repetition maximum 12-15 repetitions per set with 60s of recovery) or both ( HIIT+RT) exercise protocol in a cohort of physical inactivity , overweight adults ( age 18-30 years old). Randomized , parallel-group clinical trial among fifty-one men ( 23.6 ± 3.5 yr; 83.5 ± 7.8 kg; 28.0 ± 1.9 kg/m2) , physical inactivity ( i.e. , < 150 min of moderate-intensity exercise per week for > 6 months) , with abdominal obesity ( waist circumference ≥ 90 cm) or body mass index ≥ 25 and ≤ 30 kg/m
