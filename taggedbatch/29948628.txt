 The individual approach of the Hearing Voices Movement , Experience Focussed Counselling or Making Sense of Voices , claims a strong life context and trauma focus. This qualitative study represented the first to explore whether Experience Focussed Counselling with voice hearers , when compared to Treatment As Usual , could be considered trauma-sensitive. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews with voice hearers and mental health professionals in routine German mental health settings were analysed as part of an Applied Thematic Analysis. Overall themes identified were: trauma related; dealing with emotions; process of working with voices; intra- and interpersonal life; and coping related. Experience Focussed Counselling was considered helpful in understanding and working on unresolved trauma-related areas of distress. The same did not apply to Treatment As Usual. Findings support Experience Focussed Counselling as a trauma-sensitive intervention in hearing voices. Frontline mental health staff can potentially support voice hearers in identifying and working on trauma-related voices and emotions.
