 After oxidation , abrasion and crushing , microplastics ( MPs) can enter the aqueous environment and may adsorb surrounding organic pollutants , altering its migration and spatial distribution. Therefore , an investigation of the sorption properties and mechanism of organic pollutant on MPs can offer a theoretical basis for scientific evaluation of their ecological risks. Using tylosin ( TYL) as a model pollutant , the sorption performance of MPs was examined via a series of batch equilibrium experiments which resulted the sorptive removal of TYL on MPs reached equilibrium at 36 h , and the sorption ability of TYL on the MPs followed the order of PE ( polyethylene) < PP ( polypropylene) < PS ( polystyrene) < PVC ( polyvinyl chloride). The pseudo-second-order model well fit for the sorption kinetics data , and the adsorption isotherms could be better described by Freundlich equation rather than Langmuir model. Additionally , the initial solution pH and ionic strength played important roles across the adsorption. The sorption procedure of TYL on MPs was dominated by electrostatic interaction , surface complexation and hydrophobic interaction.
