 We aimed to report the clinically significant prostate cancer ( PCa) detection rate in men undergoing magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound ( MRI-TRUS)- cognitive fusion ( CF) targeted biopsies stratified by the Prostate Imaging and Data Reporting System ( PI-RADS) version 2 ( v2) scores. With a quality assurance waiver from the IRB , we identified a cohort of men who underwent MRI-TRUS-CF and synchronous template biopsy from 2015-2017. MRI ( PI-RADS v2 score , lesion<symptom> size , lesion<symptom> location ( peripheral or transition zone ( PZ/TZ))) , and CF-TRUS biopsy ( operator experience , TRUS visibility , and number of biopsies) features were extracted. The primary outcome was diagnosis of clinically significant ( Gleason score ≥ 3 +4 = 7 or International Society of Urological Pathology ( ISUP) grade group ≥ 2) PCa. During the study period , 131 men ( with 142 PIRADS v2 score ≥ 3 lesions<symptom>) met inclusion criteria; 98 men had previously negative template biopsy and 33 were on active surveillance for previously detected low-grade PCa. In total , 41.9 % ( 55/131) men had clinically significant PCa- 17.6 % ( 23/131) detected on targeted biopsy only , 8.4 % ( 11/131) on template biopsy only , and 16.0 % ( 21/131) on both targeted and template biopsy. Clinically significant PCa detection stratified by PI-RADS v2 scores were: 11.1 % ( 3/27) for score 3 ( indeterminate) , 42.9 % ( 24/56) for score 4 ( significant cancer likely) , and 35.6 % ( 21/59) for score 5 ( significant cancer very likely). Clinically significant PCa detection rates in targeted biopsies were better among PZ ( 41.8 % ( 33/79)) compared to TZ ( 23.8 % ( 15/63)) lesions<symptom> ( p = 0.025) in TRUS visible lesions<symptom> ( p = 0.033) and in the most experienced radiologists ( p = 0.05) , with no difference by lesion<symptom> size or number of additional core biopsies performed ( all p > 0.05). Cognitive fusion MRI-TRUS-guided targeted biopsy yielded substantially lower rates of clinically significant cancer in PI-RADS v2 score 4 and 5 lesions<symptom> when compared to published results using in-bore MR-guided or automated MRI-TRUS fusion guidance systems. Cancer detection was worst for TZ lesions<symptom>.
