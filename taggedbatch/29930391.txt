 Given advances in genomic medicine , medical students need increased confidence in clinical genetics skills to address multiple genetic conditions. After success of first-year medical school instruction in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man ( OMIM Â®) database , we report the impact on gaining confidence in broad clinical genetics skills in 5 subsequent years. We collected 5 years of successive pre- and postintervention survey based self-assessments on medical student use of genetic medicine information resources and confidence in genetic medicine skills. To assess retention of confidence in these skills , we administered a follow-up survey to students after 1-2 years of clinical rotations. We found a consistent , statistically significant increase in students ' confidence in clinical genetics skills after the first-year OMIM educational session , with confidence retention above baseline up to 2 years after the educational exposure. Skills include ability to generate a differential diagnosis for genetic conditions , share information with patients and families , and find accurate information on genetic conditions. The majority agreed that increased use of OMIM will better prepare students to achieve these skills. Integration of the OMIM database in first-year education is an effective instructional tool that may provide a lasting increase in confidence in clinical genetics skills.
