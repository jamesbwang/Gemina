 The adult mouse olfactory bulb is continuously supplied with new neurons that mostly differentiate into granule cells ( GCs). Different subtypes of adult-born GCs have been identified , but their maturational profiles and their roles in bulbar network functioning and odor behavior remain elusive. It is also not known whether the same subpopulations of GCs born during early postnatal life ( early-born) or during adulthood ( adult-born) differ in their morpho-functional properties. Here , we show that adult-born calretinin-expressing ( CR
