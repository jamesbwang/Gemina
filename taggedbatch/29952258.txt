 Waste-to-energy plants have the peculiarity of being considered both as energy production and as waste destruction facilities and this distinction is important for legislative reasons. The efficiency of waste-to-energy plants must be objective and consistent , independently if the focus is the production of energy , the destruction of waste or the recovery/upgrade of materials. With the introduction of polygeneration technologies , like gasification , the production of energy and the recovery/upgrade of materials , are interconnected. The existing methodology for assessing the efficiency of waste-to-energy plants is the R1 formula , which does not take into consideration the full spectrum of the operations that take place in waste-to-energy plants. This study introduces a novel methodology for assessing the efficiency of waste-to-energy plants and is defined as the 3T method , which stands for ` trapezoidal thermodynamic technique '. The 3T method is an integrated approach for assessing the efficiency of waste-to-energy plants , which takes into consideration not only the production of energy but also the quality of the products. The value that is returned from the 3T method can be placed in a tertiary diagram and the global efficiency map of waste-to-energy plants can be produced. The application of the 3T method showed that the waste-to-energy plants with high combined heat and power efficiency and high recovery of materials are favoured and these outcomes are in accordance with the cascade principle and with the high cogeneration standards that are set by the EU Energy Efficiency Directive.
