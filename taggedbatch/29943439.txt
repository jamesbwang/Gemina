 Sex-specific transcriptional and epigenomic profiles are detectable in the embryo very soon after fertilization. I propose that in male ( XY) and female ( XX) pre-implantation embryos sex chromosomes establish sexually dimorphic interactions with the autosomes , before overt differences become apparent and long before gonadogenesis. Lineage determination restricts expression biases between the sexes , but the epigenetic differences are less constrained and can be perpetuated , accounting for dimorphisms that arise later in life. In this way , sexual identity is registered in the epigenome very early in development. As development progresses , sex-specific regulatory modules are harbored within shared transcriptional networks that delineate common traits. In reviewing this field , I propose that analyzing the mechanisms for sexual dimorphisms at the molecular and biochemical level and incorporating developmental and environmental factors will lead to a greater understanding of sex differences in health and disease.
