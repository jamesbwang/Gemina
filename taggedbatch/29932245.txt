 The sequence kernel association test ( SKAT) is widely used to test for associations between a phenotype and a set of genetic variants that are usually rare. Evaluating tail probabilities or quantiles of the null distribution for SKAT requires computing the eigenvalues of a matrix related to the genotype covariance between markers. Extracting the full set of eigenvalues of this matrix ( an n Ã— n matrix , for n subjects) has computational complexity proportional to n
