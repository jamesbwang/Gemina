 Platelet concentrates ( PC) contain residual contaminating red blood cells ( RBC) , being higher in pooled buffy coat PC ( BC-PC) than in apheresis units ( AP-PC). Data about PC-induced alloimmunization against non-D Rhesus ( Rh) antigens are limited. For all newly detected RhD and non-D alloantibodies between August 2015 and September / 2017 we prospectively evaluated if they were triggered through PC by analyzing for incompatible RBC and/or PC transfusions. We found 5,799 positive results in 89,190 antibody screening tests. We identified 13 newly detectable Rh antibodies through incompatible PCs in 11 patients: 6 × anti-D , 4 × anti-E , 2 × anti-c , 1 × anti-f. They received a total of 156 PC ( 83 BC-PC; 73 AP-PC): 5 patients received incompatible BC-PC only , 1 patient received incompatible AP-PC only , 5 patients received incompatible BC-PC and AP-PC. Quality control showed a mean ( range) of 0.304 ( 0.152-1.662) and 0.014 ( 0.003-0.080) × 10 PC transfusions may not only induce RhD alloimmunization , but also immunization against further Rh antigens such as c , E , and f. The risk seems higher for BC-PC than for AP-PC. The results may have impact on future recommendations of PC transfusion with respect to Rh compatibility and upper limits of RBC contamination.
