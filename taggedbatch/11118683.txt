 Atmospheric particulate matter ( PM) deposition which involves both dry and wet processes is an important means of controlling air pollution. To investigate the characteristics of dry and wet deposition in wetlands , PM concentrations and meteorological conditions were monitored during summer at heights of 1.5 m , 6 m and 10 m above ground level at Cuihu Wetland ( Beijing , China) in order to assess the efficiency of PM2 .5 ( particles with an aerodynamic size of < 2.5 μm) and PM10 ( particles with an aerodynamic size of < 10 μm) removal. The results showed: Daily concentrations of PM , dry deposition velocities and fluxes changed with the same variation trend. The daily average deposition velocity for PM10 ( 3.19 ± 1.18 cm · s-1) was almost 10 times that of PM2 .5 ( 0.32 ± 0.33 cm · s-1). For PM2 .5 , the following dry deposition fluxes were recorded: 10 m ( 0.170 ± 0.463 μg · m-2 · s-1) > 6 m ( 0.007 ± 0.003 μg · m-2 · s-1) > 1.5 m ( 0.005 ± 0.002 μg · m-2 · s-1). And the following deposition fluxes for PM10 were recorded: 10 m ( 2.163 ± 2.941 μg · m-2 · s-1) > 1.5 m ( 1.565 ± 0.872 μg · m-2 · s-1) > 6 m ( 0.987 ± 0.595 μg · m-2 · s-1). In the case of wet deposition , the relative deposition fluxes for PM2 .5 and PM10 were 1.5 m > 10 m > 6 m , i.e. there was very little difference between the fluxes for PM2 .5 ( 0.688 ± 0.069 μg · m-2 · s-1) and for PM10 ( 0.904 ± 0.103 μg · m-2 · s-1). It was also noted that rainfall intensity and PM diameter influenced wet deposition efficiency. Dry deposition ( 63 %) was more tilted towards removing PM10 than was the case for wet deposition ( 37 %). In terms of PM2 .5 removal , wet deposition ( 92 %) was found to be more efficient.
