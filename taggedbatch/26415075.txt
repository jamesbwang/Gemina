 Ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R)- induced spinal<disease> cord injury can cause apoptotic damage and subsequently act as a blood-spinal cord barrier damage. MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) contributed to the process of I/R injury by regulating their target mRNAs. miR-199a-5p is involved in brain and heart I/R injury; however , its function in the spinal<disease> cord is not yet completely clarified. In this study , we investigated the role of miR-199a-5p on spinal<disease> cord I/R via the endothelin-converting enzyme 1 , especially the apoptosis pathway. In the current study , the rat spinal<disease> cord I/R injury model was established , and the Basso Beattie Bresnahan scoring , Evans blue staining , HE staining , and TUNEL assay were used to assess the I/R-induced spinal<disease> cord injury. The differentially expressed miRNAs were screened using microarray. miR-199a-5p was selected by unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis. The dual-luciferase reporter assay was used for detecting the regulatory effects of miR-199a-5p on ECE1. In addition , neuron expression was detected by immunostaining assay , while the expressions of p-ERK , ERK , p-JNK , JNK , caspase-9 , Bcl-2 , and ECE1 were evaluated by Western blot. The results indicated the successful establishment of the I/R-induced spinal<disease> cord injury model; the I/R induced the damage to the lower limb<symptom> motor. Furthermore , 18 differentially expressed miRNAs were detected in the I/R group compared to the sham group , and miR-199a-5p protected the rat spinal<disease> cord injury after I/R. Moreover , miR-199a-5p negatively regulated ECE1 , and silencing the ECE1 gene also protected the rat spinal<disease> cord injury after I/R. miR-199a-5p or silencing of ECE1 also regulated the expressions of caspase-9 , Bcl-2 , p-JNK , p-ERK , and ECE1 in rat spinal<disease> cord injury after I/R. Therefore , we demonstrated that miR-199a-5p might protect the spinal<disease> cord against I/R-induced injury by negatively regulating the ECE1 , which could aid in developing new therapeutic strategies for I/R-induced spinal<disease> cord injury.
