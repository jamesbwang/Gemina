 TAX1BP1 , a ubiquitin-binding adaptor , plays critical roles in the innate immunity and selective autophagy. During autophagy , TAX1BP1 may not only function as an autophagy receptor to recruit ubiquitylated substrates for autophagic degradation , but also serve as a Myosin VI cargo adaptor protein for mediating the maturation of autophagosome. However , the mechanistic basis underlying the specific interactions of TAX1BP1 with ubiquitin and Myosin VI remains elusive. Here , using biochemical , NMR and structural analyses , we elucidate the detailed binding mechanism and uncover the key determinants for the interaction between TAX1BP1 and ubiquitin. In addition , we reveal that both tandem zinc-fingers of TAX1BP1 and the conformational rigidity between them are required for the Myosin VI binding of TAX1BP1 , and ubiquitin and Myosin VI are mutually exclusive in binding to TAX1BP1. Collectively , our findings provide mechanistic insights into the dual functions of TAX1BP1 in selective autophagy.
