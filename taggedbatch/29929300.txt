 Ecological and human health impairments related to excess nitrogen ( N) in streams and rivers remain widespread in the United States ( U.S.) despite recent efforts to reduce N pollution. Many studies have quantified the relationship between N loads to streams in terms of N mass and N inputs to watersheds; however , N concentrations , rather than loads , are more closely related to impacts on human health and aquatic life. Additionally , concentrations , rather than loads , trigger regulatory responses. In this study , we examined how N concentrations are related to N inputs to watersheds ( atmospheric deposition , synthetic fertilizer , manure applied to agricultural land , cultivated biological N fixation , and point sources) , land cover characteristics , and stream network characteristics , including stream size and the extent of lakes and reservoirs. N concentration data were collected across the conterminous U.S. during the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's 2008-09 National Rivers and Streams Assessment ( n = 1966). Median watershed N inputs were 15.7 kg N ha
