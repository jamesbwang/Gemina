 Malate valves act as powerful systems for balancing the ATP/NAD ( P) H ratio required in various subcellular compartments in plant cells. As components of malate valves , isoforms of malate dehydrogenases ( MDHs) and dicarboxylate translocators catalyse the reversible interconversion of malate and oxaloacetate and their transport. Depending on the co-enzyme specificity of the MDH isoforms , either NADH or NADPH can be transported indirectly. Arabidopsis thaliana possesses nine genes encoding MDH isoenzymes. Activities of NAD-dependent MDHs have been detected in mitochondria , peroxisomes , cytosol and plastids. In addition , chloroplasts possess a NADP-dependent MDH isoform. The NADP-MDH as part of the ` light malate valve ' plays an important role as a poising mechanism to adjust the ATP/NADPH ratio in the stroma. Its activity is strictly regulated by post-translational redox-modification mediated via the ferredoxin-thioredoxin system and fine control via the NADP
