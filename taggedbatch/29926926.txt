 Heart- and skeletal muscle<symptom> inflammation<symptom> ( HSMI) caused by infection with Piscine orthoreovirus ( PRV) is one of the most common viral<disease> diseases<disease> in farmed Atlantic<disease> salmon ( Salmo<pathogen> salar<pathogen>) in Norway , and disease outbreaks have been reported in most countries with large-scale Atlantic<disease> salmon aquaculture. Currently there is no vaccine available for protection against HSMI , partly due to the lack of a cell line for efficient virus propagation. Erythrocytes are the primary target cells for PRV in vivo and a potential source for isolation of PRV particles. In this study , PRV was purified from infected erythrocytes , inactivated and used in a vaccination trial against HSMI. A single immunization with adjuvanted , inactivated PRV induced protection against HSMI in Atlantic<disease> salmon infected by virus injection 6 weeks later , while a moderate protection was obtained in fish infected through natural transmission , i.e. cohabitation. The PRV vaccine significantly reduced PRV loads and histopathological lesions<symptom> typical for HSMI compared to the unvaccinated control group. This is the first demonstration of protective vaccination against PRV , and promising for future control of HSMI in Atlantic<disease> salmon aquaculture.
