 Few randomized controlled trials have focused on the optimal management of patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D) during the transition from the inpatient to outpatient setting. This multicenter open-label study explored a discharge strategy based on admission hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c) to guide therapy in general medicine and surgery patients with T2D. Patients with HbA1c ≤ 7 % ( 53 mmol/mol) were discharged on sitagliptin and metformin; patients with HbA1c between 7 and 9 % ( 53-75 mmol/mol) and those > 9 % ( 75 mmol/mol) were discharged on sitagliptinmetformin with glargine U-100 at 50 % or 80 % of the hospital daily dose. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c at 3 and 6 months after discharge. Mean HbA1c on admission for the entire cohort ( N = 253) was 8.70 ± 2.3 % and decreased to 7.30 ± 1.5 % and 7.30 ± 1.7 % at 3 and 6 months ( P < .001). Patients with HbA1c < 7 % went from 6.3 ± 0.5 % to 6.3 ± 0.80 % and 6.2 ± 1.0 % at 3 and 6 months. Patients with HbA1c between 7 and 9 % had a reduction from 8.0 ± 0.6 % to 7.3 ± 1.1 % and 7.3 ± 1.3 % , and those with HbA1c > 9 % from 11.3 ± 1.7 % to 8.0 ± 1.8 % and 8.0 ± 2.0 % at 3 and 6 months after discharge ( both P < .001). Clinically significant hypoglycemia ( < 54 mg/dL) was observed in 4 % , 4 % , and 7 % among patients with a HbA1c < 7 % , 7 to 9 % , and > 9 % , while a glucose < 40 mg/dL was reported in < 1 % in all groups. The proposed HbA1c-based hospital discharge algorithm using a combination of sitagliptin-metformin was safe and significantly improved glycemic control after hospital discharge in general medicine and surgery patients with T2D.
