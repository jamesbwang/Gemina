 Acid sphingomyelinase ( ASM) is a key enzyme in sphingolipid metabolism that converts sphingomyelin to ceramide , thereby modulating membrane structures and signal transduction. Bacterial pathogens can manipulate ASM activity and function , and use host sphingolipids during multiple steps of their infection process. An increase in ceramides upon infection results in the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms that serve to cluster receptor molecules and organize intracellular signaling molecules , thus facilitating bacterial uptake. In this review , we focus on how extracellular bacterial pathogens target ASM and modulate membrane properties and signaling pathways to gain entry into eukaryotic cells or induce cell death. We describe how intracellular pathogens interfere with the intralysosomal functions of ASM to favor replication and survival. In addition , bacteria utilize their own sphingomyelinases as virulence factors to modulate sphingolipid metabolism. The potential of ASM as a target for treating bacterial infections is also discussed.
