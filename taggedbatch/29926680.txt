 To investigate the role of tetramethylpyrazine ( TMP) nitrone in proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells ( NSCs). We separated and cultivated the original generation of NSCs from cerebral cortex of 14 days rat embryo , and the phenotype characteristics of the third-generation NSCs was tested by immunofluorescence. The experiment was divided into control group , β-mercaptoethanol positive control group , tetramethylpyrazine nitrone group and tetramethylpyrazine nitrone + ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid ( EGTA) group ( The primary NSCs was isolated successfully , neurospheres with typical NSCs morphology and expressing nestin was formed at 3-5 days. As BrdU and MTT assay results shown , compared with the control group andβ-mercaptoethanol positive control group , the NSCs proliferation numbers of tetramethylpyrazine nitrone group increased significantly ( Tetramethylpyrazine nitrone can significantly enhance the proliferation and neuronal differentiation rate of NSCs. Decrease in extracellular Ca
