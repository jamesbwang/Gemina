 The purpose of the study was to identify if differences existed between male and female nursing students in occurrence rates of bullying and who was perpetrating the bullying. Results of a survey of 107 nursing students found that patients , nurses , and other hospital staff bullied female nursing students significantly more than male nursing students. The findings indicate that nurse educators need to be diligent while on the clinical unit as female students are more likely to be bullied by those they are learning from in these settings.
