 The aim of this study was to analyse patient-reported outcomes of reduction mammoplasty among Brazilian women. A total of 100 women were enrolled in this cross-sectional controlled study , 50 with breast hypertrophy ( Hypertrophy Group) and 50 who had undergone breast reduction at least six and up to 12 months before ( Mammoplasty Group). The Brazilian version of the BREAST-Q Â® was applied to assess patient-reported outcomes. The module reduction/mastopexy was used , and the preoperative and postoperative versions were applied to the hypertrophy and mammoplasty groups , respectively. The mammoplasty group presented higher scores for the subscales satisfaction with breasts<disease> , psychosocial well-being , sexual well-being and physical well-being ( p = 0.0001 for all of these subscales). These results suggest that patients submitted to reduction mammoplasty are satisfied with the outcomes and present better quality of life scores compared with women with breast hypertrophy.
