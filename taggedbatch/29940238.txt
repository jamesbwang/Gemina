 Trans-diagnostic , domain- or symptom-focused approaches have been heralded as advancing psychiatric research , but relatively few clinical research programmes have been undertaken to leverage their potential. In this manuscript we describe the approach and protocol for an exploratory study , PRISM ( Psychiatric Ratings using Intermediate Stratified Markers) , that will be conducted to explore the biomarkers in schizophrenia ( SZ) and Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD) that may be related to a common symptom , social withdrawal. Patient participants ( N = 72 SZ and N = 72 AD study completers) , will complete a series of fMRI , EEG , and behavioural paradigms , as well as contributing blood-derived ( e.g. epigenetic) and smartphone data related to social behaviour. Self- as well as caregiver- and researcher-reported assessments will be provided to characterise social withdrawal. Normative data will also be collected from a group of healthy controls ( N = 48 study completers) , half of whom will be matched in terms of age and gender distribution to the SZ and AD group , respectively. Thus we will explore both differentiation and cross-diagnostic overlap in the biomarkers associated with different levels of social withdrawal in SZ and AD. In this way we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of symptomatology common to both disorders , and provide insights into novel treatment targets and future drug development approaches.
