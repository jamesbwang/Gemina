 The objective of the present study was to use retrospective data to test the hypothesis that cannabis dependence would be associated with an increased rate of post-deployment suicide attempts. Participants included 319 veterans who had deployed to either Iraq or Afghanistan. Study procedures involved completion of a structured clinical interview and a battery of self-report questionnaires. As expected , lifetime cannabis dependence was significantly associated with post-deployment suicide attempts , AOR = 7.963 , p = .014 , even after controlling for the effects of pre-deployment suicide attempts , posttraumatic stress disorder , depression<symptom> , pain , non-cannabis substance use disorder , and gender. While preliminary , our findings provide the first evidence to date that heavy cannabis use may be a unique risk factor for post-deployment suicide attempts among veterans.
