 Planned doses are used as surrogate for the actually delivered dose in radiotherapy. We have estimated the delivered dose in a dose-escalation trial of locally advanced prostate cancer by statistical dose-accumulation and by DVH-summation , and compared to planned dose. Prescribed dose-escalation to the prostate was 67.5 Gy/25fr. , corresponding to 81GyEQD2 assuming α/β = 1.5. The 21 patients had three targets ( i.e. CTV67 .5 + 2 mm , CTV60 + 5 mm , CTV50 + 10 mm) irradiated by a simultaneous-integrated-boost technique. Analysis was based on 213 CT scans and 5-years of follow-up. For statistical dose-accumulation , we modelled 10000 possible treatment courses based on planned dose and deformation-vector-fields from contour-based registration. For DVH-summation we recalculated dose on repeat-CTs and estimated median D98 %/ EUD. Groups with/without disease recurrence were compared. Discrepancies between planned and accumulated dose were mostly seen for CTV67 .5 , where under-dosage was found at different locations in the prostate in 12/21 patients. Delivered dose-escalation ( D98 %) was on average 73.9 GyEQD2 ( range: 68.3-78.7 GyEQD2). No significant difference in accumulated-D98 % was found in patients with ( n = 8) and without ( n = 13) recurrence ( p > 0.05). Average D98 %/ EUD with statistical dose-accumulation vs DVH-summation was significantly different in CTV60 , CTV50 , rectum and bladder but not in CTV67 .5. The planned dose escalation was not received by more than half-of-the patients. Robustness of the prostate target ( CTV67 .5) should therefore be better prioritized in these patients given the low toxicity profile. Estimates of delivered dose were less conservative for dose-accumulation due to interaction of random organ motion with the dose matrix.
