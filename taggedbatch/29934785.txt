 This review presents biocontrol agents employed to alleviate the deleterious effect of the pathogen Fusarium<pathogen> graminearum on maize. The control of this mycotoxigenic phytopathogen remains elusive despite the elaborate research conducted on its detection , identification , and molecular fingerprinting. This could be attributed to the fact that in vitro and greenhouse biocontrol studies on F. graminearum have exceeded the number of field studies done. Furthermore , along with the variances seen among these F. graminearum suppressing biocontrol strains , it is also clear that the majority of research done to tackle F. graminearum outbreaks was on wheat and barley cultivars. Most fusariosis management related to maize targeted other members of Fusarium<pathogen> such as Fusarium<pathogen> verticillioides<pathogen> , with biocontrol strains from the genera Bacillus<pathogen> and Pseudomonas being used frequently in the experiments. We highlight relevant current techniques needed to identify an effective biofungicide for maize fusariosis and recommend alternative approaches to reduce the scarcity of data for indigenous maize field trials.
