 Colistin resistance can occur by chromosomal mutations and by acquisition of plasmid-carrying determinants , mainly mcr-1. In the recent years , we have observed the outburst of this resistance gene in our region. Due to the risk of the rapid dissemination of mcr-1 , this finding has worried and alerted different actors from the health field and has become one of the most prolific topics. Our review compiles available reports of well-documented mcr-1-positive strains of Enterobacteriaceae , obtained from different samples in Argentina and other countries of Latin America. Furthermore , it addresses the association of mcr-1 with ESBL resistance markers and outlines the platforms involved in their dissemination.
