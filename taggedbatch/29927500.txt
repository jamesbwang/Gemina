 Although 7,8-dihydroxyflavone ( 7,8-DHF) , a synthetic agonist specific for tyrosine kinase receptor B ( TrkB) , has been reported to promote intestinal dynamics , its effect on gastric dynamics has not been studied as yet. In this study , we explored how 7,8-DHF affected the carbachol ( CCh)- induced contraction of rat gastric muscle by way of measuring the contractile tension of muscular strips. We found that although 7,8-DHF did not directly cause contraction of gastric muscle , it enhanced CCh-induced , instead of substance P- or high K
