 Global energy and resource shortages make it necessary to quest for renewable resources. n-Caproic acid ( CA) production based on carboxylate platform by anaerobic fermentation is booming. Recently , a novel Ruminococcaceae bacterium<pathogen> CPB6 is shown to be a potential biotransformation factory for CA production from lactate-containing wastewater. However , little is known about the effects of different electron acceptors ( EAs) on the fermentative products of strain CPB6 , as well as the optimum medium for CA production. In this study , batch experiments were performed to investigate the fermentative products of strain CPB6 in a lactate medium supplemented with different EAs and sugars. Supplementation of acetate , butyrate and sucrose dramatically increased cell growth and CA production. The addition of propionate or pentanoate resulted in the production of C5 or C7 carboxylic acid , respectively. Further , a Box-Behnken experiment was conducted to optimize the culture medium for CA production. The result indicated that a medium containing 13.30 g/L sucrose , 22.35 g/L lactate and 16.48 g/L butyrate supported high-titer CA production ( 16.73 g/L) with a maximum productivity of 6.50 g/L/day. This study demonstrated that strain CPB6 could produce C6-C7 carboxylic acids from lactate ( as electron donor) with C2-C5 short-chain carboxylic acids ( as EAs) , but CA ( C6 carboxylic acid) was the most major and potential product. Butyrate and sucrose were the most significant EA and carbon source respectively for CA production from lactate by strain CPB6. High titer of CA can be produced from a synthetic substrate containing sucrose , lactate and butyrate. The work provided significant implications for improving CA production in industry-scale.
