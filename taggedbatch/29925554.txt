 Pyoderma gangrenosum ( PG) coexisting with Cogan 's syndrome<disease><symptom> ( CS) is uncommon , although cutaneous manifestations are known to develop in CS. A middle-aged white female patient had chronic relapsing PG requiring ciclosporin and prednisolone. Despite receiving optimal doses of ciclosporin and prednisolone , she developed acute vestibulo-auditory symptoms as a result of CS. Ciclosporin was switched to methotrexate and prednisolone was increased. However , she continued to develop acute scleritis , requiring methylprednisolone pulses , and still had further flares of PG. Her methotrexate was held off when she developed severe pneumonia<disease> and she then received a trial of intravenous immunoglobulins ( IVIG) for her recurrent leg ulcers<disease><symptom>. Unfortunately , she failed to respond to IVIG. Her ulcers<disease><symptom> eventually responded to six doses of monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide induction. Although CS is not an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( ANCA)- associated vasculitis , we used pulse cyclophosphamide , based on the experience of cyclophosphamide efficacy in severe ANCA-associated vasculitis ( AAV). Following induction , both diseases currently remain under control with azathioprine as maintenance treatment.
