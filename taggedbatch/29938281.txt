 An auto-oxidation promoted sp3 C-H arylation reaction between N-aryl glycine derivatives and electron-rich arenes , leading to the formation of N-aryl α-aryl α-amino acid derivatives , is described. This atom-economical and environmentally benign reaction proceeds smoothly under mild reaction conditions and requires only Brønsted acid and oxygen ( balloon). A plausible radical involved mechanism is proposed.
