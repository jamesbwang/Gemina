 Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) inhibitors have been utilized for the treatment against advanced or recurrent cervical carcinoma as a novel therapeutic modality. However , the expression level of VEGF in post-radiotherapy relapsed/persistent cervical cancer remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of VEGF and associated molecules using tumor samples from patients with post-radiotherapy relapsed/persistent cervical cancer. From a database of 826 patients who were treated at our institution between 2003 and 2015 , eight patients with post-radiotherapy relapsed/persistent cervical cancer were identified , and 20 patients who underwent initial surgery alone were used as a control. Using samples from these patients , the expression levels of VEGF-A , VEGF receptor-1 ( VEGFR-1) and hypoxia inducible factor-1α ( HIF-1α) were immunohistochemically categorized as negative or weakly , moderately , or strongly positive according to the size of the staining area , and intensity. In carcinoma cells , the expression levels of VEGF-A , VEGFR-1 and HIF-1α were significantly higher in post-radiotherapy relapsed/persistent cervical cancer compared with control patients ( P = 0.0003 , 0.0003 , and 0.0001 , respectively). In stroma cells , similar tendencies with statistical significance were observed ( P = 0.0014 and P < 0.0001 , respectively). In addition , the expression levels of VEGF-A and VEGFR-1 in carcinoma cells were significantly correlated with each other ( P < 0.0001). A significantly higher expression of VEGF was identified in post-radiotherapy relapsed/persistent cervical cancer compared with typical specimens from cervical cancer. The findings provide a novel insight into the clinical treatment for recurrent/persistent cervical cancer using a VEGF antagonist.
