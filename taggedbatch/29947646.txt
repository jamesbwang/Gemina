 Tetranychus ludeni damages the sweet potato. Pest development can vary between plant genotypes. The objective was to identify the preference of Tetranychus ludeni for Ipomoea batatas genotypes , from the germplasm bank at the Universidade Federal dos Vales do Jequitinhonha e Mucuri ( UFVJM). Natural infestations of this mite were observed on 54 sweet potato genotypes in potted , in a greenhouse. Three mite-infested leafs of each genotype were collected and analyzed. The red mite showed different population density rate in genotypes. The BD 29 genotype was found to be highly susceptible , the BD 08 , BD 57 , BD 17 and Espanhola genotypes were moderately susceptible , and the others forty-nine genotypes showed low susceptibility to the mite.
