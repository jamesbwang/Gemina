 High-energy all-solid-state lithium ( Li) batteries have great potential as next-generation energy-storage devices. Among all choices of electrolytes , polymer-based systems have attracted widespread attention due to their low density , low cost , and excellent processability. However , they are generally mechanically too weak to effectively suppress Li dendrites and have lower ionic conductivity for reasonable kinetics at ambient temperature. Herein , an ultrastrong reinforced composite polymer electrolyte ( CPE) is successfully designed and fabricated by introducing a stiff mesoporous SiO
