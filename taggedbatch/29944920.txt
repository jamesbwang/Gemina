 Marine bivalves can act as bioindicators of marine environment pollution by multidrug-resistant ( MDR) enteric bacteria of medical interest. The aim of this study was to report the draft genome sequence of a plasmid-encoded AmpC ( pAmpC) ( CMY-2)- carrying Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolate recovered from a marine bivalve sample in the coastal shore of Southeast Brazil. The whole genome was sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq platform and was assembled using Velvet v. 1.2.10. Data analysis was carried out using tools available from the Center of Genomic Epidemiology and Geneious R10 software. The genome size was calculated at 5198055bp , comprising a total of 5316 protein-coding sequences. The strain was assigned to ST457 and presented the bla The release of this draft genome sequence can provide valuable information to better understand the dissemination of MDR enteric bacteria in marine environments.
