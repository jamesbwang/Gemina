 NUPR1 is a protumoral multifunctional intrinsically disordered protein ( IDP) , which is activated during the acute phases of pancreatitis<disease>. It interacts with other IDPs such as prothymosin Î± , as well as with folded proteins such as the C-terminal region of RING1-B ( C-RING1B) of the Polycomb complex; in all those interactions , residues around Ala33 and Thr68 ( the ` hot-spot ' region) of NUPR1 intervene. Its paralogue , NUPR1L , is also expressed in response to DNA damage , it is p53-regulated , and its expression down-regulates that of the
