 This retrospective study was conducted in 2017 with the objective of evaluating the value of acute phase peripheral blood parameters in predicting dengue haemorrhagic fever<symptom> ( DHF). Patients , who were admitted to Teaching Hospital Peradeniya between January and August 2017 due to dengue illness , were recruited into this study. A total of 515 patients participated in the study. Among them , 333 were DHF patients while 182 patients were managed as DF. There was a significant difference in mean values of platelets and haemoglobin observed during acute phase in non-leakers compared to the patients who progressed to DHF , while no significant difference was observed for white blood cells , neutrophils , lymphocytes and haematocrit values. A significantly higher mean value was observed in white blood cells and hemoglobin in leakers compared to non-leakers during day 5. Mean day 5 platelet value was significantly lower among leakers compared to non-leakers but no significant difference between haematocrit , neutrophil and lymphocyte<symptom> values were observed. ROC curve performed for acute phase platelet values and haemoglobin values to gain a predictive value for female and male DHF patients and cut off values with high sensitivity and specificity to predict DHF could be obtained for the platelet count.
