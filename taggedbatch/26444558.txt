 Plants are sessile organisms and , in order to defend themselves against exogenous ( a) biotic constraints , they synthesize an array of secondary metabolites which have important physiological and ecological effects. Plant secondary metabolites can be classified into four major classes: terpenoids , phenolic compounds , alkaloids and sulphur-containing compounds. These phytochemicals can be antimicrobial , act as attractants/repellents , or as deterrents against herbivores. The synthesis of such a rich variety of phytochemicals is also observed in undifferentiated plant cells under laboratory conditions and can be further induced with elicitors or by feeding precursors. In this review , we discuss the recent literature on the production of representatives of three plant secondary metabolite classes: artemisinin ( a sesquiterpene) , lignans ( phenolic compounds) and caffeine ( an alkaloid). Their respective production in well-known plants , i.e. ,
