 Bacteria undergoing anaerobic fermentation must maintain redox balance<symptom>. In vivo metabolic evolution schemes based on this principle have been limited to targeting NADH-dependent reactions. Here , we developed a facile , specific , and high-throughput growth-based selection platform for NADPH-consuming reactions in vivo , based on an engineered NADPH-producing glycolytic pathway in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. We used the selection system in the directed evolution of a NADH-dependent d-lactate dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii toward utilization of NADPH. Through one round of selection , we obtained multiple enzyme variants with superior NADPH-dependent activities and protein expression levels; these mutants may serve as important tools in biomanufacturing d-lactate as a renewable polymer building block. Importantly , sequence analysis and computational protein modeling revealed that diverging evolutionary paths during the selection resulted in two distinct cofactor binding modes , which suggests that the high throughput of our selection system allowed deep searching of protein sequence space to discover diverse candidates en masse.
