 Control of Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> ( Mtb) infection requires CD4 In the present study , we evaluated in vivo dynamics of early Ag presentation by murine lymph-node ( LN) DCs in response to Mycobacterium<pathogen> bovis<pathogen> bacillus<pathogen> Calmette-Gu√©rin ( BCG) Ag85A protein. Results showed that the early Ag-presenting activity of murine DCs induced by M.<pathogen> bovis<pathogen> BCG Ag85A protein in vivo was transient , appearing at 4 h and being barely detectable at 72 h. The transcription levels of CIITA , MHC II and the expression of MHC II molecule on the cell surface increased following BCG infection. Moreover , BCG was found to survive within the inguinal LN DC pool , representing a continuing source of mycobacterial Ag85A protein , with which LN DCs formed Ag85A peptide-MHCII complexes in vivo. Our results demonstrate that a decrease in Ag85A peptide production as a result of the inhibition of Ag processing to is largely responsible for the short duration of Ag presentation by LN DCs during BCG infection in vivo.
