 Outbreaks of Cyclospora cayetanensis infection have been linked to consumption of food and water contaminated by oocysts that can survive both physical and chemical disinfectants. Magnesium oxide ( MgO) nanoparticles ( NPs) can be potentially used in food as bactericides. In this study , C. cayetanensis pre- and post-sporulated oocysts were exposed to MgO NPs with different doses ranging from 1.25-25 mg/ml. With comparison to control , the antiprotozoal activity of MgO NPs was evaluated by identifying the median effective concentration dose ( EC
