 To quantify absolute cardiovascular disease ( CVD) risk in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their use of lipid-lowering therapies. Cross-sectional analysis of nationally representative data from 2820 participants aged 18-74 years who provided biomedical data for the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Measures Survey component of the 2012-13 Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey. Prior CVD and use of lipid-lowering medications were ascertained at interview. 5-year absolute risk of a primary CVD event was calculated with the Australian National Vascular Disease Prevention Alliance algorithm , with categories low ( < 10 %) , moderate ( 10-15 %) and high risk ( > 15 %). Among participants aged 35-74 years , 9.6 % ( 95 % CI , 7.2-12.0 %) had prior CVD; 15.7 % ( 95 % CI , 13.0-18.3 %) were at high , 4.9 % ( 95 % CI , 3.3-6.6 %) at moderate , and 69.8 % ( 95 % CI , 66.8-72.8 %) at low absolute primary CVD risk. 82.6 % of those at high primary risk were identified on the basis of clinical criteria. High primary absolute risk affected 1.1 % ( 95 % CI , 0.0-2.5 %) of 18-24-year-olds , 4.7 % ( 95 % CI , 2.0-7.5 %) of 25-34-year-olds , and 44.2 % ( 95 % CI , 33.1-55.3 %) of 65-74-year-olds. Lipid-lowering therapy was being used by 52.9 % ( 95 % CI , 38.2-67.6 %) of people aged 35-74 years with prior CVD and by 42.2 % ( 95 % CI , 30.5-53.8 %) of those at high primary CVD risk. Absolute CVD risk is high among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people , and most of those at high risk are undertreated. Substantial proportions of people under 35 years of age are at high risk , but are not targeted by current guidelines for absolute CVD risk assessment , compromising CVD prevention in this population.
