 Adherence to Mediterranean diet ( MedDiet) is associated with the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM). However , in intervention studies , there is discordance in the interpretation of a MedDiet. The purpose of this paper was to examine , synthesize , and develop a narrative review , exploring the qualitative differences in the interpretation of a modernized MedDiet prescribed as an intervention in clinical trials for the management of T2DM , and how closely this aligns with a traditional MedDiet. The ` traditional ' MedDiet is often described as a dietary pattern high in unprocessed plant foods ( fruits , vegetables , legumes , nuts , wholegrain cereals , and olive oil); moderate consumption of wine; low<symptom> moderate in fish/shellfish; and an infrequent consumption of red meat , animal fats , vegetable oils , and processed foods. Synthesis of the reviewed literature demonstrates considerable variation in the qualitative interpretation of a MedDiet. We also identified inadequate reporting of MedDiet interventions , despite a number of studies referring to their intervention as a ` traditional ' MedDiet. The majority of studies emphasized the same key dietary components and principles: an increased intake of vegetables , wholegrains , and the preferential consumption of white meat in substitute of red and processed meat and abundant use of olive oil. However , the reporting of specific dietary recommendations for fruit , legumes , nuts , bread , red wine , and fermentable dairy products were less consistent or not reported. Irrespective of the discordance in the interpretation of a MedDiet , a number of studies included in the present review reported improved glycaemic control and favorable cardiovascular outcomes with adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet. Nevertheless , greater clarity and depth of reporting amongst intervention studies is warranted for the refinement of a modernized MedDiet definition that is distinct from a prudent dietary pattern.
