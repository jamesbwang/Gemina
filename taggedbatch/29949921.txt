 We have synthesized novel coumarin-based fluorescent chemosensors for detection of fluoride ions in aqueous solution. The detection mechanism relied on a fluoride-mediated desilylation triggering fluorogenic reaction and a strong interaction between fluoride and the silicon center. In this work , the hydroxyl-decorated coumarins containing oxysilyl moiety have been synthesized through the aldehyde-functionalized coumarins. The optical responses toward fluoride , as well as aqueous stability studies of both aldehyde and hydroxyl functionalized coumarins , have been investigated. Due to the highest fluorescence enhancement upon the addition of fluoride and good stability in aqueous solution , the hydroxyl-decorated coumarin connected with the bulky
