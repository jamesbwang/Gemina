 Technological advances have led to innovative insulin delivery systems for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. In particular , the combination of miniature engineering and software algorithms contained in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII) system pumps provide the user and the healthcare practitioner with an opportunity to review and adjust blood glucose ( BG) levels according to system feedback , and to modify or programme their regimen according to their needs. While CSII pumps record a number of data parameters such as BG level , carbohydrate intake , activity and insulin delivered , these data are generally ` locked in ' and can only be accessed by uploading to a cloud-based system , thus information is not contemporaneous. The Cellnovo Diabetes Management System ( Cellnovo , Bridgend , UK) allows data to be transmitted securely and wirelessly in real time to a secure server , which is then retrieved by an online platform , the Cellnovo Online platform , enabling continuous access by the user and by clinicians. In this article , the authors describe a retrospective review of the patient data automatically uploaded to the Cellnovo Online platform. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics collected at the start of pump therapy are shown for all patients , and BG data from a sub-cohort of patients who have been using the system for at least 6 months and who take and record an average of three BG level tests per day are presented to demonstrate glycaemic data over time.
