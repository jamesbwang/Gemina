 We report the case of a solitary meningioma infiltrating the trochlear nerve , the first in a patient without a neurocutaneous disorder or cavernous sinus involvement. The patient presented with diplopia<symptom> was found to have a focal enhancing mass encompassing the trochlear nerve. Following surgical resection , pathological examination showed meningioma infiltrating the nerve itself , demonstrated on the included pathology images. A review of the literature and discussion of meningiomas infiltrating cranial<symptom> nerves are included.
