 The Relational Aspects of Care Questionnaire ( RAC-Q) is an electronic instrument which has been developed to assess staff 's interactions with patients when delivering relational care to inpatients and those accessing accident and emergency ( A&E) services. The aim of this study was to reduce the number of questionnaire items and explore scoring methods for `` not applicable '' response options. Participants ( n = 3928) were inpatients or A&E attendees across six participating hospital trusts in England during 2015-2016. The instrument , consisting of 20 questionnaire items , was administered by trained hospital volunteers over a period of 10 months. Items were subjected to exploratory factor analysis to confirm unidimensionality , and the number of items was reduced using a range of a priori psychometric criteria. Two alternative approaches to scoring were undertaken , one treated `` not applicable '' responses as missing data , while the second adopted a problem score approach where `` not applicable '' was considered `` no problem with care. '' Two short-form RAC-Qs with alternative scoring options were identified. The first ( the RAC-Q-12) contained 12 items , while the second scoring option ( the RAC-Q-14) contained 14 items. Scores from both short forms correlated highly with the full 20-item parent form score ( RAC-Q-12 , The RAC-Q is designed to offer near-real-time feedback on staff 's interactions with patients when delivering relational care. The new short-form RAC-Qs and their respective method of scoring are reflective of scores derived using the full 20-item parent form. The new short-form RAC-Qs may be incorporated into inpatient surveys to enable the comparison of ward or hospital performance. Using either the RAC-Q-12 or the RAC-Q-14 offers a method to reduce missing data and response fatigue<symptom>.
