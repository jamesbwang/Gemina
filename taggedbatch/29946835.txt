 This study investigated the effect of temperature and methane partial pressure on the anaerobic methane-oxidizing and sulfate-reducing ( AOM-SR) activities by a highly enriched ANME-2a community. The ANME-2a-enriched biomass was incubated at different pressures , i.e. , 2 , 10 , 20 , and 30 MPa at 15 °C for 80 days. The response of the microbial community with temperature was investigated in incubations at 4 , 15 , and 25 °C at 10 MPa. Among all tested conditions , the incubation at 10 MPa pressure and 15 °C showed the highest AOM-SR activity of the studied ANME-2a phylotype , whereas activity at 2 MPa pressure and 15 °C was almost comparative to the response at 10 MPa pressure. The finding of the most favorable conditions for AOM-SR activity by the studied AOM-SR community comparable to the in situ pressure and temperature ( 15 °C at 10 MPa) suggests that the studied ANME-2a phylotype was well adapted to the conditions similar to its origin. The microbial community analysis showed that the bacterial community composition shifted upon changing the incubation temperature and pressure.
