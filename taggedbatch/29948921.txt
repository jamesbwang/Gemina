 During a typical day , visual working memory ( VWM) is recruited to temporarily maintain visual information. Although individuals often memorize external visual information provided to them , on many other occasions they memorize information they have constructed themselves. The latter aspect of memory , which we term self-initiated WM , is prevalent in everyday behavior but has largely been overlooked in the research literature. In the present study we employed a modified change detection task in which participants constructed the displays they memorized , by selecting three or four abstract shapes or real-world objects and placing them at three or four locations in a circular display of eight locations. Half of the trials included identical targets that participants could select. The results demonstrated consistent strategies across participants. To enhance memory performance , participants reported selecting abstract shapes they could verbalize , but they preferred real-world objects with distinct visual features. Furthermore , participants constructed structured memory displays , most frequently based on the Gestalt organization cue of symmetry , and to a lesser extent on cues of proximity and similarity. When identical items were selected , participants mostly placed them in close proximity , demonstrating the construction of configurations based on the interaction between several Gestalt cues. The present results are consistent with recent findings in VWM , showing that memory for visual displays based on Gestalt organization cues can benefit VWM , suggesting that individuals have access to metacognitive knowledge on the benefit of structure in VWM. More generally , this study demonstrates how individuals interact with the world by actively structuring their surroundings to enhance performance.
