 Proinsulin is a misfolding-prone protein making its biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) a stressful event. Pancreatic β-cells overcome ER stress by activating the unfolded protein response ( UPR) and reducing insulin production. This suggests that β-cells transition between periods of high insulin biosynthesis and UPR-mediated recovery from cellular stress. We now report the pseudotime ordering of single non-diabetic human β-cells detected by large-scale RNA sequencing. We identified major states with 1) low UPR and low insulin gene expression , 2) low UPR and high insulin gene expression or 3) high UPR and low insulin gene expression. The latter state was enriched for proliferating cells. Stressed human β-cells do not dedifferentiate and show little propensity for apoptosis. These data suggest that human β-cells transition between states with high rates of biosynthesis to fulfill the body 's insulin requirements to maintain normal blood glucose levels and UPR-mediated recovery from ER stress due to high insulin production.
