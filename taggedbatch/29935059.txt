 Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma ( SNUC) is a very rare entity with a poor prognosis. Due to the lack of studies on the subject , evidence is lacking concerning its management. A multicenter collaborative study was conducted to assess treatment strategy , oncological outcome , and prognostic factors. Definitive analyses focused on 54 patients with a majority of advanced stage; the 3-year overall survival ( OS) and 3-year recurrence-free survival ( RFS) rates were , respectively , 62.4 % and 47.8 %. During the follow-up , 18 patients ( 33.3 %) died , 10 ( 18.5 %) developed metastases , 7 had lymph-node involvement ( 13 %) , and 12 ( 22.2 %) showed recurrence or local progression. In univariate analyses , treatment modalities associated with improved RFS were induction chemotherapy ( p = 0.02) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( p = 0.007). In the multivariate analyses , only induction chemotherapy ( p = 0.047 , hazard ratio ( HR) = 0.39) was significantly associated with improved RFS. Multimodal therapies including induction chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy may improve the prognosis of SNUC; surgery might improve local control. Further multicenter studies are required.
