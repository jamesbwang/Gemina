 The intrinsic efficacy of orthosteric ligands acting at G-protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs) reflects their ability to stabilize active receptor states ( R *) and is a major determinant of their physiological effects. Here , we present a direct way to quantify the efficacy of ligands by measuring the binding of a R *- specific biosensor to purified receptor employing interferometry. As an example , we use the mu-opioid receptor ( µ-OR) , a prototypic class A GPCR , and its active state sensor , nanobody-39 ( Nb39). We demonstrate that ligands vary in their ability to recruit Nb39 to µ-OR and describe methadone , loperamide , and PZM21 as ligands that support unique R * conformation ( s) of µ-OR. We further show that positive allosteric modulators of µ-OR promote formation of R * in addition to enhancing promotion by orthosteric agonists. Finally , we demonstrate that the technique can be utilized with heterotrimeric G protein. The method is cell-free , signal transduction-independent and is generally applicable to GPCRs.
