 Ischemic stroke not only induces neuron death in the infarct area but also structural and functional damage of the surviving neurons in the surrounding peri-infarct area. In the present study , we first identified cofilin rod , a pathological rod-like aggregation , formed in neurons of in vivo ischemic stroke animal model and induced neuronal impairment. Cofilin rods formed only on the ipsilateral side of the middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion ( MCAO-R) rat brain and showed the highest density in peri-infarct area. Our real-time live cell imaging , immunostaining and patch clamp studies showed that cofilin rod formation in neurons led to dendritic mitochondrial transportation failure , as well as impairment of synaptic structure and functions. Overexpression of LIM kinase or activation of its upstream regulator Rho , suppressed ischemia-induced cofilin rod formation and showed protective effect on synaptic function and structure impairment in both cultured neurons and MCAO-R rat model. In summary , our results demonstrate a novel mechanism of ischemic stroke-induced neuron injury in peri-infarct area and provide a potential target for the protection of neuronal structure and function against brain ischemia insult.
