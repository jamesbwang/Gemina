 HIV<pathogen> self-testing ( HIVST) provides a promising tool to screen sex partners for men who have sex with men ( MSM) who engage in condomless sex and want to avoid HIV<pathogen> infection. While previous studies have demonstrated HIVST acceptability and increased testing uptake , limited data exists on its use between sex partners for point-of-sex HIV<pathogen> testing. This study examined prevalence and correlates of point-of-sex HIVST among Chinese MSM. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 400 HIV-negative Chinese MSM in 2017. Participants were recruited through a multifaceted sampling approach and self-administered an electronic questionnaire. Point-of-sex HIVST was measured by asking participants if they had ever conducted HIVST with a sex partner before sex to ensure that they both knew their HIV<pathogen> statuses. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify correlates of point-of-sex HIVST after controlling for age , education and sexual orientation. Overall , 19.2 % ( 77/400) men reported point-of-sex HIVST ( 51.3 % among self-testers). Participants who had four or more HIV<pathogen> self-tests before had 7.57 fold greater odds ( 95 % CI: 3.75 , 15.28) of reporting point-of-sex HIVST compared to those who had fewer HIVST experiences. Point-of-sex HIVST was otherwise not associated with most other socio-demographic or behavioral practices , suggesting that it may be broadly acceptable. A substantial proportion of Chinese MSM had utilized HIVST with their partners before sex , especially among those who were more experienced with HIVST. Scale up and routine implementation of HIVST programs are further warranted to facilitate point-of-sex HIV<pathogen> testing.
