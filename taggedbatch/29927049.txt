 To assess and compare the long-term efficacy and safety of single-incision mini-slings ( SIMS) except tension-free vaginal tape ( TVT)- Secur with standard midurethral slings ( SMUS) for female stress urinary incontinence through an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) comparing these 2 surgical methods. A literature review of all RCTs comparing SIMS ( Mini-Arc , Contasure-Needleless , Ophira , Tissue Fixation System , and Ajust) except TVT-Secur with SMUS was performed. The Medline , Embase , Scopus , Web of Science , and Cochrane Controlled Trial Register databases were reviewed. We retrieved 29 RCTs ( N = 2986) comparing SIMS except TVT-Secur with SMUS. Meta-analysis of long-term results showed no significant difference in the patient-reported cure rate ( odds ratio ( OD) , 0.67; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.44-1.60); however , we found that SMUS had a significantly superior objective cure rate ( OD , 0.68; 95 % CI , 0.47-0.99; p = 0.04). SIMS were associated with a significantly shorter operation time , lower immediate postoperative pain based on the visual analog scale score , lower intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , and lower postoperative voiding dysfunction. The meta-analysis showed clear evidence of the superiority of SMUS over SIMS except TVT-Secur , in terms of the objective cure rate , on long-term follow-up. However , SIMS are superior with respect to immediate postoperative pain , intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , and postoperative voiding dysfunction. This article is protected by copyright.
