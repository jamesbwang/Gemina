 The introduction of a piezoelectric field has been proven a promising method to enhance photocatalytic activity by preventing photoelectron-hole recombination. However , the formation of a piezoelectric field requires additional mechanical force or high-frequency ultrasonic baths , which limits its potential application on industrial scale. Therefore , it is of great practical significance to design the catalyst that can harvest the discrete energy such as the fluid mechanical energy to form the electric field. Herein , PZT/TiO
