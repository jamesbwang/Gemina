 Tetramycin , a novel polyene macrolide antibiotic , has strong activity against a broad spectrum of fungi<pathogen> and may have potential uses in future agricultural applications. Thus , the antifungal activity and biochemical action of tetramycin on Colletotrichum<pathogen> scovillei were investigated in this study. The experimental results indicated that tetramycin had strong inhibitory activity against the mycelial growth , spore germination and germ tube elongation of C. scovillei. The baseline sensitivity curves were unimodal , with mean EC
