 Free fatty acids ( FFA) mediate adverse metabolic effects such as downregulated carbohydrate metabolisms , providing causal links between obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM). Here , we investigated the plasma concentrations of FFA alone and in combination with protein glycation as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of T2DM. EDTA-plasma obtained from 48 newly diagnosed male T2DM patients , 48 long-term controlled ( 24 male and 24 female) T2DM patients , 20 prediabetic male T2DM patients and two age-matched control cohorts ( 48 non-diabetic ( ND) men; 24 male and 24 female ND partipants) were analysed for a set of clinical parameters including FFA. Glycation sites were quantified after tryptic digestion using tandem mass spectrometry. Median plasma concentrations of FFA were almost three-fold higher in samples obtained from newly diagnosed ( long-term controlled) T2DM patients than in those obtained from the control group , providing diagnostic sensitivity ( SN) of 92 % ( 85 %) and specificity ( SP) of 90 % ( 88 %). When combined with the glycation level of lysine-141 of haptoglobin , diagnostic accuracy improved further for newly diagnosed ( SN , 94 %; SP 96 %) and long-term controlled ( SN , 85 %; SP , 94 %) T2DM patients ( HbA1c: SN , 88 %; SP , 96 %). A prospective pilot study evaluating the prognostic value revealed initially low FFA levels for pre-diabetic patients that increased in the following four years in patients whose prediabetic state worsened or who developed T2DM. FFA levels are elevated in newly diagnosed and long-term controlled T2DM patients , providing high diagnostic accuracy of 87 % and 91 % , respectively , which improved further when combined with the glycation degree of lysine-141 in haptoglobin. Additionally , FFA showed higher mean fold-changes than HbA1c or FPG in subjects developing T2DM , indicating higher sensitivity towards the progression of the disease.
