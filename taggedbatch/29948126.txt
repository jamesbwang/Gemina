 Identification of NnCER2 and NnCER2-LIKE from Nelumbo nucifera , which are required for the very-long-chain fatty acid elongation , provides new evidence that CER2 proteins are evolutionarily conserved across the eudicots. CER2-LIKE family proteins have been described as core components of the fatty acid elongase complex in Arabidopsis , maize , and rice , having specific function in synthesis of the C
