 Stochastic simulation has been widely used to model the dynamics of biochemical reaction networks. Several algorithms have been proposed that are exact solutions of the chemical master equation , following the work of Gillespie. These stochastic simulation approaches can be broadly classified into two categories: network-based and- free simulation. The network-based approach requires that the full network of reactions be established at the start , while the network-free approach is based on reaction rules that encode classes of reactions , and by applying rule transformations , it generates reaction events as they are needed without ever having to derive the entire network. In this study , we compare the efficiency and limitations of several available implementations of these two approaches. The results allow for an informed selection of the implementation and methodology for specific biochemical modeling applications.
