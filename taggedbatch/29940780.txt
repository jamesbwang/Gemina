 Dofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the conversion of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> and atrial flutter and maintenance of sinus rhythm in symptomatic patients with persistent arrhythmia. Drug trials showed neutral mortality in post-myocardial infarction patients and those with heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. This is a review of postmarket data , including real-world efficacy and safety in a variety of populations. Dofetilide has been used off-label with success in patients with paroxysmal atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> and atrial flutter , as well as atrial tachycardia<symptom> and ventricular tachycardia<symptom>. The real-world acute conversion rate of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> and atrial flutter is higher than that reported in clinical trials. Dofetilide has an acceptable safety profile when initiated ( or reloaded) under hospital monitoring and dosed according to creatinine clearance. Dofetilide is well tolerated and a good choice for patients with acceptable renal function and a normal QT interval , especially if atrioventricular nodal blockade needs to be avoided.
