 Cancer is a heterogenetic disease at both the level of clinical manifestation and the level of the genome. Single-cell sequencing provides an unprecedented means of characterizing the intra-tumor heterogeneity and detecting and analyzing the genomes of cancer cells. These data will help to reconstruct the understanding of the evolutionary lineage of cancer cells. In the future , single-cell technology is believed to be a useful tool in diagnostic and prognostic application in oncology. The application of single cell technology in clinics will make it possible to detect cancer non-invasively at early stages and to develop precision medicine. In this chapter , we review the research and application status of the single cell technology in cancer.
