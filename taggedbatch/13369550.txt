 Platelet concentrates ( PCs) , represented by platelet-rich plasma ( PRP) , have been widely applied in the fields of regenerative and aesthetic therapies. PCs ' mechanisms of action , however , are too complicated , and it is not easy to present the whole picture; besides , clinical outcomes are hardly reproducible in many cases. Therefore , several medically advanced countries seemingly intend to regulate PC therapies weakly or strictly because of the increasing popularity. Japan established laws and regulations for PC therapy in the `` Act on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine '' along with the `` Pharmaceuticals , Medical Devices and Other Therapeutic Products Act '' in 2014 , which , to our knowledge , represent the strictest regulatory framework for production and therapeutic use of PCs in the world. According to these laws and regulations , PCs produced for topical use should be prepared as cell-based medicinal products , essentially as should stem cells , in accordance with their registered ( `` licensed '' under actual conditions) standard operating procedures. Nonetheless , criteria for their quality are not standardized. In this review , we discuss the quality of PC preparations by focusing on the basic concept and regulatory framework of regenerative medicine in Japan. Within the new framework , PC therapy is regulated by a specific notification and registration system , as is stem cell therapy. In comparison with the latter , however , risk factors that hamper successful PC therapy are much fewer. Via appropriate evaluation of patients ' conditions and whole-blood samples by simple and sensitive but not yet fully standardized assays , it is theoretically possible that PC quality will be controlled nearly completely. In addition to or instead of standardization of preparation protocols , standardization of preoperative examination of individual PC preparations is an urgent task for improving and guaranteeing the safety and efficacy of PC therapy.
