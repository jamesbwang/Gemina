 ( Purpose) The main purpose of the study was to examine the relationship of a battery of frequently used functional assessment tests with quadriceps and hamstrings isokinetic strength in Knee-osteoarthritis ( OA) patients. Secondarily , the predictability of isokinetic strength on these performance variables was also assessed. ( Subjects and Methods) Seventeen males and 23 females with Knee-OA , were assessed via a) the common functional tests: 6-minute walk test , Timed up-and-go test , 30-second chair test and 12-stair test and b) isokinetic concentric extension-flexion at 120 °/ s and 180 °/ s. ( Results) Both Knee Extension and Flexion Peak Torque per Body<symptom> weight showed moderate<symptom> to strong , statistically significant correlation , with all 4-functional performance tests , for both velocities. Both 12-stair test and 30-second chair test were significant predictors in all analyses , while the 6-minute walk test was an additional significant predictor of the 120 °/ s knee flexion. ( Conclusion) Thigh muscle strength in both tested velocities proved to be significantly correlated with functional performance. The 12-stair test and 30-second chair test results were significant predictors for isokinetic extension and flexion in both velocities. It appears that those two tests challenge the knee and the surrounding musculature in a manner that reflects muscle strength.
