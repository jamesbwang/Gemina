 Liver surgery has developed significantly in the past decades. In Brazil , the interest on it has grown significantly , but there is no study regarding its clinical practice. Despite intrinsic limitations , surveys are well suited to descriptive studies and allow understanding the current scenario. To provide an overview on the current spread of liver surgery in Brazil , focusing on groups ' profile , operative techniques and availability of resources. From May to November 2016 , was conducted a national survey about liver surgery profile in Brazil composed by 28 questions concerning surgical team characteristics , technical preferences , surgical volume , results and available institutional resources. The survey was sent by e-mail to 84 liver surgery team leaders from different centers including all regions of the country. Forty-three study participants ( 51.2 %) , from all Brazilian regions , responded the survey. Most centers have residency/fellowship programs ( 86 %) , perform and do laparoscopic procedures ( 91 %); however , laparoscopy is still responsible for a little amount of surgeries ( 1-9 % of laparoscopic procedures over all liver resections in 39.5 % of groups). Only seven centers ( 16.3 %) perform more than 50 liver resections/year. Postoperative mortality rate is between 1-3 % in 55 % of the centers. This is the first depiction of liver surgery in Brazil. It showed a surgical practice aligned with worldwide excellence centers , concentrated on hospitals dedicated to academic practice.
