 Radioembolization ( RE) is a valuable treatment for liver cancer. It consists of administering radioactive microspheres via an intra-arterially placed catheter with the aim of lodging these microspheres , which are driven by the bloodstream , in the tumoral bed. Even though it is a safe treatment , some radiation-induced complications may arise. In trying to detect or solve the possible incidences that cause nontarget irradiation , simulating the particle-hemodynamics in hepatic arteries during RE via computational fluid dynamics ( CFD) tools has become a valuable approach. This paper reviews the parameters that influence the outcome of RE that have been studied via numerical simulations. In this numerical approach , the outcome of RE is regarded as successful if particles reach the artery branches that feed tumor-bearing liver segments. Up to 10 parameters have been reviewed. The variation of each parameter actually alters the hemodynamics pattern in the vicinities of the catheter tip , and locally alters the incorporation of the particles into the bloodstream. Therefore , in general , the local influences of these parameters should result in global differences in terms of particle distribution in the hepatic artery branches. However , it has been observed that under some ( qualitatively described) appropriate conditions where particles align with blood streamlines , the local influence resulting from a variation of a given parameter vanishes and no global differences are observed. Furthermore , the increasing number of CFD studies on RE suggests that numerical simulations have become an invaluable research tool in the study of RE.
