 The eighth edition of AJCC cancer staging manual incorporated biomarker status into the prognostic staging group ( PSG). We used data from National Cancer Database ( NCDB) to validate and improve the PSG. All patients had surgery and at least some systemic treatment ( endocrine therapy , chemotherapy or HER2 targeted therapy). Information from 420,520 patients was assessed for potential predictors of overall survival ( OS) , including age at diagnosis ( age) , tumor grade ( G) , hormonal receptor and HER2 status , and presence of lymph vascular invasion ( LVI) , stratified by stage or sub-stages. Based on the multivariate Cox analyses , we built different point systems to predict OS and evaluated the different point systems by Akaike 's information criterion ( AIC) , Harrell 's concordance index ( C-index) , and Uno 's concordance index. Age , G , hormonal receptor and HER2 status , LVI and being TNBC were significantly associated with OS ( all P < 0.0001). Three staging systems were correlated with OS: system 1 was the conventional anatomic TNM staging; system 2 included TNM , age , G , hormonal receptor , HER2 , and LVI; system 3 included TNM , age , G , TNBC versus non-TNBC , and LVI. System 3 ( C-index; 0.7316; AIC: 488138.91) achieved the best balance<symptom> between predictive performance and goodness-of-fit to the NCDB data as compared to system 2 ( C-index: 0.7325; AIC: 498087.73) and system 1 ( C-index: 0.716; AIC: 688536.49). The new PSG is a better staging system than the conventional anatomic TNM system. Grouping breast cancer into TNBC versus non-TNBC may be simpler while retaining similar accuracy as using ER/PR/HER2 status to predict OS.
