 The bipolar disorder diagnosis in prepubertal children became popular because it answered a clinical need to treat the explosive behavior component of irritability<symptom> and the hope that antimanic strategies would be helpful. Poor<symptom> definition of episodes resulted in mixing chronic and episodic irritability<symptom> in samples of children with bipolar disorder. The subsequent dramatic increase in neuroleptic use is a testimony to the importance of the problem of irritability<symptom> and our need to better understand it. Insofar as our use of the term irritability<symptom> conflates proneness to anger with the subsequent aggressive response , it will again not be clear who is being studied. We need to uncouple the mood and behavior aspects of irritability<symptom> for further study or we will have traded the imprecision of `` bipolar '' for the imprecision of irritability<symptom>.
