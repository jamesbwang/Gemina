 The study focuses on the question of how the design of operational integration management ( OIM) can be optimized , especially in small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs) , and how previous experience with operational integration management can be used to develop preventive measures to ensure employability. The study follows a multi-perspective qualitative research design. It focused on the survey of 40 retrospective interviews with employees who have undergone different variants of the OIM. In addition , company and inter-company actors were examined through expert surveys. The evaluation of the interviews followed the heuristics of case reconstruction and the research strategy of Grounded Theory. Various influencing factors for the design of a operational integration management can be identified- the biographically anchored attitudes of employers and employees , the corporate culture as well as ( company-specific) structural factors- which can become successful conditions and inhibitors of OIM processes in SMEs. Dilemmas that can hinder OIM processes are also evident. OIM processes can also have effects that go beyond the OIM objectives in a narrower sense. The reintegration and retention of the employability of employees can be successful above all if there is a trust-based corporate culture of mindfulness , appreciation and openness. This depends in particular on the attitudes of all those involved. But even in such a corporate culture , dilemmas and conflict potential have an influence on the success of the OIM process. Each company also needs internal and/or external actors with sufficient knowledge and skills to carry out an OIM.
