 Inter-individual variability is always an issue when treating patients of different races , genders , ages , pharmacogenetics , and pharmacokinetic characteristics. However , the development of novel dosage forms is limited by the huge investments required for production line modifications and dosages diversity. Additive manufacturing ( AM) or 3D printing can be a novel alternative solution for the development of controlled release dosages because it can produce personalized or unique dosage forms and more complex drug-release profiles. The primary objective of this manuscript is to review the 3D printing processes that have been used in the pharmaceutical area , including their general aspects , materials , and the operation of each AM technique. Advantages and shortcomings of the technologies are discussed with respect to practice and practical applications. Thus , this review will provide an overview and discussion on advanced pharmaceutical AM technologies , which can be used to produce unique controlled drug delivery systems and personalized dosages for the future of personalized medicine.
