 Despite advances in prostate cancer therapy , dissemination and growth of metastases results in shortened survival. Here we examined the potential anti-cancer effect of the NF-κB inhibitor parthenolide ( PTL) and its water soluble analogue dimethylaminoparthenolide ( DMAPT) on tumour progression and metastasis in the TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate ( TRAMP) model of prostate cancer. Six-week-old male TRAMP mice received PTL ( 40 mg/kg in 10 % ethanol/saline) , DMAPT ( 100 mg/kg in sterile water) , or vehicle controls by oral gavage thrice weekly until palpable tumour formation. DMAPT treatment slowed normal tumour development in TRAMP mice , extending the time-to-palpable prostate tumour by 20 %. PTL did not slow overall tumour development , while the ethanol/saline vehicle used to administer PTL unexpectedly induced an aggressive metastatic tumour phenotype. Chronic ethanol/saline vehicle upregulated expression of NF-κB , MMP2 , integrin β1 , collagen IV , and laminin , and induced vascular basement membrane degradation in primary prostate tumours , as well as increased metastatic spread to the lung and liver. All of these changes were largely prevented by co-administration with PTL. DMAPT ( in water) reduced metastasis to below that of water-control. These data suggest that DMAPT has the potential to be used as a cancer preventive and anti-metastatic therapy for prostate cancer. Although low levels of ethanol consumption have not been shown to strongly correlate with prostate cancer epidemiology , these results would support a potential effect of chronic low dose ethanol on metastasis and the TRAMP model provides a useful system in which to further explore the mechanisms involved.
