 Adult-type granulosa<pathogen> cell tumors of the ovary ( aGCTs) are rare gynecologic malignancies that exhibit a high frequency of somatic FOXL2 c.C402G ( p.Cys134Trp) mutation. Treatment of relapsed aGCT remains a significant clinical challenge. Here we show , using whole-exome and cancer gene panel sequencing of 79 aGCTs from two independent cohorts , that truncating mutation of the histone lysine methyltransferase gene KMT2D ( also known as MLL2) is a recurrent somatic event in aGCT. Mono-allelic KMT2D-truncating mutations are more frequent in recurrent ( 10/44 , 23 %) compared with primary ( 1/35 , 3 %) aGCTs ( p = 0.02 , two-sided Fisher 's exact test). IHC detects additional non-KMT2D-mutated aGCTs with loss of nuclear KMT2D expression , suggesting that non-genetic KMT2D inactivation may occur in this tumor type. These findings identify KMT2D inactivation as a novel driver event in aGCTs and suggest that mutation of this gene may increase the risk of disease recurrence.
