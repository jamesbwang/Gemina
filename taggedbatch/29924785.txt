 Knowledge of anatomical variations of the division of the popliteal artery and specific lesions<symptom> of the arterial segment involved is necessary for the surgeon , traumatologist-orthopaedist , vascular surgeon. The article contains a review of recent literature data on the prevalence of different variants of branching patterns of the arteries of the crus , also providing a detailed discussion of embryological development of the arterial system of the lower extremities , in many ways explaining the appearance of rare pathologies of the popliteal artery , such as for example popliteal artery entrapment syndrome<disease><symptom>. Particular attention is paid to cystic damage of the popliteal artery , describing currently known theories of the development of this rare pathology , this is accompanied by sharing own experience in surgical treatment of the patients involved. Awareness of anatomical variants and peculiarities of embryonic development contributes to decreasing the possibility of iatrogenic damage of the popliteal artery during orthopaedic operations and to appropriate decision-making as to the method of revascularization.
