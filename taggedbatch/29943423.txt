 MXenes , a family of two-dimensional transition-metal carbide and nitride materials , are thought to be promising materials in energy storage because of their high electronic conductivity , hydrophilic surfaces , and low diffusion barriers. MXenes are generally prepared by removing the `` A '' elements ( A = Al , Si , Sn , etc.) from their corresponding MAX phases by using hydrofluoric acid ( HF) and other etching agents , although these `` A '' elements usually have great volumetric and gravimetric capacities.
