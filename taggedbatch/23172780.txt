 The high genetic variability of hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> , together with the high level of glycosylation on the viral envelope proteins shielding potential neutralizing epitopes , pose a difficult challenge for vaccine development. An effective hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) vaccine must target conserved epitopes and the HCV<pathogen> E2 glycoprotein is the main target for such neutralizing antibodies ( NAbs). Recent structural investigations highlight the presence of a highly conserved and accessible surface on E2 that is devoid of N-linked glycans and known as the E2 neutralizing face. This face is defined as a hydrophobic surface comprising the front layer ( FL) and the CD81 binding loop ( CD81bl) that overlap with the CD81 receptor binding site on E2. The neutralizing face consists of highly conserved residues for recognition by cross-NAbs , yet it appears to be high conformationally flexible , thereby presenting a moving target for NAbs. Three main overlapping neutralizing sites have been identified in the neutralizing face: antigenic site 412 ( AS412) , antigenic site 434 ( AS434) , and antigenic region 3 ( AR3). Here , we review the structural analyses of these neutralizing sites , either as recombinant E2 or epitope-derived linear peptides in complex with bNAbs , to understand the functional and preferred conformations for neutralization , and for viral escape. Collectively , these studies provide a foundation and molecular templates to facilitate structure-based approaches for HCV<pathogen> vaccine development.
