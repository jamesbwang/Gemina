 Assessing the prevalence of sexual violence in Brazil and its association with individual and contextual factors. A multilevel analysis performed with cross-sectional data from 2010. The adjusted prevalence ratio was estimated through Poisson multilevel modelling. Cross-level interactions were evaluated by the inclusion of interaction terms between socio-economic variables from the two levels. Sexual violence is more prevalent in federal units that presented lower years of schooling expectancy at 18 years old ( PR 1.27; CI95 % 1.09-1.48) , lower per capita income ( PR 1.23; CI95 % 1.05-1.43) , lower HDI ( PR 1.17; CI95 % 1.01-1.37) , higher proportion of poverty vulnerability ( PR 1.18; CI95 % 1.02-1.38) , higher proportion of unemployment ( PR 1.68; CI95 % 1.45-1.96) and higher proportion of people who neither work nor study ( PR 1.26; CI95 % 1.08-1.46). Higher prevalence of sexual violence was associated with lower Gini index and greater coverage of primary health services. In analysing the tendency demonstrated a strong contextual effect between the Brazilian federative units in relation to sexual violence CONCLUSIONS: The strategy to reduce sexual violence in Brazil must be integrated with other social policies , considering both individual risk factors and macro-social determinants.
