 Stably expressed transforming growth factor- beta 1 ( TGF-β1) MCs were obtained and the effects of centellaasiatica ( CA) granule on the expressions of Smad 2/3 , Smad 7 and collagen Ⅳ and the level of Smad 2/3 phosphorylation were observed. Lipofectin method was used to transfect TGF-β1 vector into MC , and the stably expressed TGF-β1 cell lines were selected by G418. The cells were divided into three groups. Control group: normal MC + RPMI 1640 + 10 % normal rat serum; TGF-β1 group: stably expressed TGF-β1 MC + RPMI 1640 + 10 % normal rat serum; CA group: stably expressed TGF-β1 MC + RPMI 1640 + 10 % rat serum containing high CA. The experiments were repeated for five times. The contents of TGF-β1 and collagen Ⅳ in the culture medium were detected with ELISA , the expressions of mRNA and protein of TGF-β1 , Smad 2/3 , Smad 7 and the level of Smad 2/3 phosphorylation were detected by using real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The contents of TGF-β1 and collagen Ⅳ in the culture medium of stably-expressed TGF-β1 MC were increased significantly , and the CA could reverse the effects of TGF-β1. The expressions of mRNA and protein of TGF-β1 , Smad 2/3 and the level of Smad 2/3 phosphorylation were increased significantly in TGF-β1 transfected MC , and CA could dramatically reduce the expressions of mRNA and protein of TGF-β1 , Smad 2/3 and the level of Smad 2/3 phosphorylation. The high expression of TGF-β1 decreased the expression of Smad 7 mRNA and protein , and the CA could antagonize the effect of mRNA expression. The MCs stably-expressed TGF-β1 can activate the TGF-β1/ Smad signal pathway and increase the expression of collagen Ⅳ. CA can decrease the occurrence of diabetic nephropathy ( DN) by reducing the production of collagen Ⅳ through inhibiting the TGF-β1/ Smad signal pathway.
