 This study aims to quantitatively summarize risk factors associated with surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> after open reduction and internal fixation of ankle fractures. Relevant original studies were searched in Medline , Embase , China National Knowledge Infrastructure , Wanfang database and Cochrane central database ( all through April 2018). Studies eligible had to meet the quality assessment criteria by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and to evaluate the risk factors for surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> after open reduction and internal fixation of ankle fractures. The Stata 11.0 was used to this meta-analysis. 10 studies involving 8103 cases of ankle fracture treated by open reduction and internal fixation and 583 cases of surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> were included in this meta-analysis. The incidence of surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> is 7.19 %. Our meta-analysis identified the significant increased risk factors with surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> after open reduction and internal fixation of ankle fractures ( P < 0.05) is: body mass index ( both continuous and dichotomous variables); American Society of Anesthesiologists â‰¥ 3; diabetes; alcohol; open fracture; subluxation/dislocation; incision cleanness grade 2-4; high-energy mechanism; chronic<symptom> heart disease; history of allergy; and use of antibiotic prophylaxis. After sensitivity analysis , meta-analysis results for these factors did not change the significance , indicating that the results were robust. Patients involved with the above-mentioned medical conditions were at risk for surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> after open reduction and internal fixation of ankle fracture. The present study may in this respect serve as a baseline reference and this knowledge will allow the formulation of public health strategies to prevent surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> after orthopedic surgery.
