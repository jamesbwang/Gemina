 Altered hydrological , sediment , and nutrient regimes can lead to dramatic increases in periphyton abundance in rivers below impoundments. Flushing flows are a commonly adopted strategy to manage the excess periphyton that can accumulate , but in practice they often prove ineffective. Designing hydrological regimes that include flushing flows may be overlooking key processes in periphyton removal , particularly the role of abrasion and molar action induced by substrate movement. Setting flow targets which aim to initiate substrate movement are likely to improve periphyton removal , but an understanding of the site-specific thresholds for substrate entrainment and periphyton removal is required. Despite decades of entrainment studies accurate and consistent measurement and prediction of substrate entrainment remains elusive , making it challenging to study the relationship between substrate movement and periphyton removal , and to set flow targets. This paper makes a case for using substrate entrainment and transport thresholds as the target metric for flushing flows to manage excess periphyton accrual. This paper critically reviews the determinants of periphyton accrual and associated management methods. This paper also aims to provide a reference for interdisciplinary research on periphyton removal by summarising the geomorphic and hydraulic literature on methods for estimating and measuring substrate entrainment and transport. This will provide a basis for ecologists to identify tools for quantifying entrainment and transport thresholds so they are better placed to explore the direct linkages between phases of sediment transport and periphyton accrual. These linkages need to be identified in order for river managers to set effective flushing flow targets.
