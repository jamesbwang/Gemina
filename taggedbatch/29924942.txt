 Exosomes derived from chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan ( CSPG) 4 type neural precursor cells ( CSPG4Es) were purified from human plasma by sequential immunoabsorption with anti-CSPG4 and anti-platelet growth factor receptor Î± mAb to characterize the potential in vivo roles of CSPG4 cells in neuronal repair. Hepatocyte growth factor , fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs) -2 and -13 , and type 1 insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-1) , which enhance neuronal survival and functions , were quantified in CSPG4E extracts. For CSPG4Es of 24 healthy control subjects , mean levels of hepatocyte growth factor , FGF-13 , and IGF-1 , but not FGF-2 , were significantly higher by up to 7-fold than in their neuronal-derived exosomes , and mean levels of all 4 growth factors were significantly higher by up to 8-fold than in their astrocyte-derived exosomes. Mean CSPG4E levels of all growth factors were significantly lower in patients with mild Alzheimer disease ( AD) ( n = 24) than in age- and sex-matched cognitively normal control subjects ( n = 24). Mean CSPG4E levels of all growth factors were also significantly lower in 15 patients at the stage of moderate dementia from AD ( AD
