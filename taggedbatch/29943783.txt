 It is well known that Pt shows much weaker plasmonic effects in the visible spectrum when compared to Au , Ag and Cu. Therefore , the realization of efficient optical absorption by Pt nanoparticles with sizes below 10 nm in the visible spectrum remains a challenge. One possible way to enhance the optical absorption is to prepare Pt-based bimetallic magnetic nanoparticles. Furthermore , if an external magnetic field is applied , the synergistic effect of both electric and magnetic fields may provide sufficient SERS enhancement. In this paper , CoPt hollow nanoparticles ( NPs) with sizes below 10 nm and ultrathin shells ( âˆ¼ 2 nm) were synthesized in solution , at room temperature. The NPs have high surface-to-volume ratios and excellent structural stability. The hollow NPs exhibited enhanced light absorption characterized by surface-enhanced Raman scattering ( SERS) with 4-mercaptobenzoic acid ( 4-MBA) as tip molecules. It is noted that the SERS enhancement of these alloyed NPs can be tuned by using an external magnetic field. A synergistic optical effect between these hollow NPs and the Ag film substrate is obtained. Hence , CoPt hollow NPs show promise as SERS substrates and potential for other applications in optical enhancement.
