 The association between myeloperoxidase ( MPO) polymorphism and the risk of cervical cancer is inconclusive. We performed a meta-analysis to clarify if a correlation exists between MPO polymorphism and the risk for developing cervical cancer. All case-control research studies that determined a relationship between MPO and cervical cancer reported up until March 1 , 2018 in PubMed , Web of Science , VIP , WanFang , and the CNKI Database were accessed and included. The strength of association was evaluated with pooled odds ratios ( ORs) and their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CIs). We used sensitivity analysis to detect the stability of our results , conducted Q-test to evaluate heterogeneity and applied Begg 's funnel plot and Egger 's test to investigate any publication bias among selected studies. In this meta-analysis , we included 5 eligible studies in the final evaluation , which included 1125 patients with cervical cancer and 1150 cancer-free control patients. A potential association between the MPO -463 G > A polymorphism and cervical cancer risk was observed ( recessive model: OR = 0.65 , 95 % , CI: 0.43-0.98 , P = 0.038; homozygous model: OR = 0.65 , 95 % , CI: 0.43-0.99 , P = 0.045) , which indicates that genotype AA reduces the risk of cervical cancer by 35 % compared to GG/GA or GG genotypes in our results. A stratified analysis by ethnicity identified a significant correlation among Caucasian patients ( recessive model: OR = 0.57 , 95 % , CI: 0.34-0.95 , P = 0.029; homozygous model: OR = 0.60 , 95 % , CI: 0.36-0.99 , P = 0.048) and a stratified analysis by source of control identified a significant correlation among population-based studies. Our results suggest that the presence of polymorphism , -463 G > A in patients might offer them protection against cervical cancer. By implementing randomized case-control or cohort studies with larger sample sizes , the clinical significance of our results can be further strengthened and verified.
