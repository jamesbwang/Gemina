 The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of urinary incontinence in fitness instructors , experience of teaching pelvic floor muscle exercises ( PFME) , and attitudes to incorporating such exercises into classes. An online survey was undertaken of fitness instructors working in Scotland based on the Urinary Incontinence Short Form ( ICIQ-UI). The survey was at least partially completed by 106 , of whom 73.6 % ( 53/72) were female and 52.8 % ( 38/72) were in the 35-54 years age group. Prevalence of UI was 28.2 % ( 24/85) , and severity based on ICIQ-UI scores was ` slight ' 65.2 % ( 15/23) , or ` moderate ' in 26.1 % ( 6/23). Leakage of urine was associated with physical activity in 36 % ( 9/25) , of whom 31.8 % ( 7/22) had not taken actions to reduce the impact , and 86.4 % ( 19/22) had not sought professional advice or treatment. There was widespread willingness to incorporate PFME into classes if given appropriate training 86.1 % ( 62/72) , and 67.1 % ( 49/73) would be happy to recommend a PFME app. A significant proportion of fitness instructors are in need of PFME and those who perform PFME do so at a level below that which is recommended. However , many have had some training on PFME or are willing to provide this.
