Eight full texts were evaluated but only five were selected for the qualitative and quantitative analyses. Duration of follow-up after Urolastic 速 injections was significantly heterogeneous , ranging from 6 to 24 months. Secondary injections were needed in 16.7 % -35.0 % of the treated patients. The pooled proportion of secondary injections was 20 % ( 95 % CI: 15 % -24 %; I Urolastic 速 showed effectiveness in patients with SUI during a follow-up period of 6-24 months.
