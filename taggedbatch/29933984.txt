 Hymexazol is an efficacious and widely used fungicide. However , its environmental toxicological assessment has not been well documented. It had no report of its toxicity to fish embryo. Fish embryo acute toxicity tests are highly predictive of aquatic embryotoxicity outcome. In this study , zebrafish ( Danio<pathogen> rerio<pathogen>) embryos were exposed to hymexazol at varying concentrations for the study of the developmental toxicity , melanin biosynthesis , biochemical and transcriptional endpoints. The embryotoxicity tests indicated that the 96h LC
