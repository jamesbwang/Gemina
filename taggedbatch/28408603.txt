 Current technologies for single-cell DNA sequencing require whole-genome amplification ( WGA) , as a single cell contains too little DNA for direct sequencing. Unfortunately , WGA introduces biases in the resulting sequencing data , including non-uniformity in genome coverage and high rates of allele dropout. These biases complicate many downstream analyses , including the detection of genomic variants. We show that amplification biases have a potential upside: long-range correlations in rates of allele dropout provide a signal for phasing haplotypes at the lengths of amplicons from WGA , lengths which are generally longer than than individual sequence reads. We describe a statistical test to measure concurrent allele dropout between single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) across multiple sequenced single cells. We use results of this test to perform haplotype assembly across a collection of single cells. We demonstrate that the algorithm predicts phasing between pairs of SNPs with higher accuracy than phasing from reads alone. Using whole-genome sequencing data from only seven neural cells , we obtain haplotype blocks that are orders of magnitude longer than with sequence reads alone ( median length 10.2 kb versus 312 bp) , with error rates < 2 %. We demonstrate similar advantages on whole-exome data from 16 cells , where we obtain haplotype blocks with median length 9.2 kb-comparable to typical gene lengths-compared with median lengths of 41 bp with sequence reads alone , with error rates < 4 %. Our algorithm will be useful for haplotyping of rare alleles and studies of allele-specific somatic aberrations. Source code is available at https://www.github.com/raphael-group.
