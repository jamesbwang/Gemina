 Pulsed lasers operating in the mid-infrared ( 3-25 Âµm) are increasingly becoming the light source of choice for a wide range of industrial and scientific applications such as spectroscopy , biomedical research , sensing , imaging , and communication. Up to now , one of the factors limiting the mid-infrared pulsed lasers is the lack of optical switch with a capability of pulse generation , especially for those with wideband response. Here , a semiconductor material of bismuth oxyselenide ( Bi
