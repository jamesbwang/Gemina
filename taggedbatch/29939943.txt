 Vascular phenotype by assessing carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity ( cf-PWV) and central SBP ( cSP) in the young could be used as an intermediate cardiovascular outcome measure. Tonometry is considered the gold-standard technique , but its use is challenging in clinical practice , especially when used in children. The purpose of this study was to validate cf-PWV and cSP assessment with novel oscillometric device ( SphygmoCor XCEL) in children and adolescents. cf-PWV and cSP were measured in 72 children and adolescents aged 6-20 years. Measurements were performed by applanation tonometry and by the SphygmoCor XCEL device at the same visit under standardized conditions. Regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots were used for comparison of the tonometer-based with oscillometric-based method. Mean cf-PWV measured by applanation tonometry was 4.85 ± 0.81 m/s and measured by SpygmoCor XCEL was 4.75 ± 0.81 m/s. The mean difference between the two devices was 0.09 ± 0.47 m/s ( P = NS). cSP measured by SpygmoCor XCEL was strongly correlated with cSP measured by applanation tonometry ( R = 0.87 , P < 0.001). Mean cSP measured by applanation tonometry was 103.23 ± 9.43 mmHg and measured by SpygmoCor XCEL was 103.54 ± 8.87 mmHg. The mean cSP difference between the two devices was -0.30 ± 3.34 mmHg ( P = NS) , and fulfilled the AAMI criterion 1. The estimated intersubject variability was 2.17 mmHg. The new oscillometric SphygmoCor XCEL device provides equivalent results for cf-PWV and cSP values to those obtained by tonometry in children and adolescents. Thus , the SphygmoCor XCEL device could be appropriate for assessing cf-PWV and cSP in the pediatric population.
