 Natural denitrification in groundwater systems has been recognised as an ecosystem service that reduces the impact of agriculturally-derived nitrate inputs to surface waters. Identification of this ecosystem service within the landscape would permit spatially differentiated land management and legislation. However , spatial variation in groundwater redox conditions poses a significant challenge to such a concept. To gain understanding of the small-scale mosaic of biogeochemical and hydrological controls on denitrification , we established a well field consisting of 11 multilevel well ( MLW) clusters on a hillslope containing relict organic matter buried by volcanic deposits 1.8 ka before present. Based on site-specific redox classification thresholds , vertical redox gradients and denitrification potentials were detected at 7 of the 11 sites. Palaeosols or woody debris , which had previously been identified in laboratory experiments as resident electron donors fuelling denitrification , were visually recognisable at 4 of the 7 MLW sites with vertical redox gradients. Moderately enhanced groundwater dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) concentrations occurred where resident electron donors were evident. DOC concentrations were lower where anoxic and nitrate-depleted groundwater was found but with an absence of resident electron donors. In these instances , it was assumed that nitrate reduction had occurred somewhere upgradient of the sampled well screen along the lateral groundwater flow path , with the proximate electron donor ( DOC) largely consumed in the process , since no evidence was found for denitrification being fuelled by inorganic electron donors. Due to high variability in the isotopic signature of nitrate in oxidised groundwater , the nitrate dual isotope method did not yield firm evidence for denitrification. However , realistic vertical patterns were obtained using the excess N
