 To investigate the effects of excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress on lung ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R) induced myocardial injury in mice. Forty healthy SPF male C57BL/6J mice were divided into 4 groups randomly ( Compared with sham group , the cardiomyocytes had obvious damage under light microscope , and the serum creatine kinase-MB ( CK-MB) and lactic dehydrogenase ( LDH) activities , apoptosis index and Caspase 3 enzymatic activity were increased significantly , the expressions of p-Jun N-terminalkinase ( p-JNK) , Caspase 12 , CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein ( CHOP) and glucose regulated protein 78 ( GRP78) protein and mRNA were up-regulated in I/R , TM and 4-PBA groups ( The excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress participates in myocardial injury induced by lung ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R) and inhibit excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress response can relieved myocardial injury.
