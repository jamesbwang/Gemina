 Andreev bound states are an expression of quantum coherence between particles and holes in hybrid structures composed of superconducting and non-superconducting metallic parts. Their spectrum carries important information on the nature of the pairing , and determines the current in Josephson devices. Here , I focus on Andreev bound states in systems involving superconductors and ferromagnets with strong spin-polarization. I provide a general framework for non-local Andreev phenomena in such structures in terms of coherence functions , and show how the latter link wave function and Green-function based theories.This article is part of the theme issue ` Andreev bound states '.
