 The paper is a case report presenting Cat Scratch Disease ( CSD) in a 1.5-year- old girl. Bartoneloses , including CSD , are a group of infectious<disease> diseases<disease> which are rarely detected , therefore there are no statistical data concerning the aetiology , and the incidence of CSD noted in Poland is low in comparison with other European countries. The purpose of the paper is to discuss several problems related to CSD. A 1.5-year-old girl who was seen in hospital for the sparing use of her left arm when crawling. X-rays showed osteolytic lesions<symptom> which radiologists described as multi-ocular cyst<symptom> or infection. As neither clinical examination nor laboratory investigations found pathological signs , the patient was followed-up on an ambulant basis. Repeated x-ray taken 4 weeks later showed increased periosteal proliferation accompanied by pain. The baby was admitted to the Clinic but additional investigations found no pathologies. The baby was consulted by a rheumatologist and haematologist; however , they did not facilitate a definitive diagnosis. As the baby developed , because of a thickening of the soft<disease> tissues on the dorsal side of the distal epiphisis in the forearm the doctors decided to inspect the condition operatively. Macroscopic examination found brownish granulated tissue. Suction drainage was inserted and a tissue sample was tested for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria , tuberculosis<disease> and borelliosis. The test results were negative. The baby was in good condition , was not pyrexial and suffered from less pain. The diagnostics was further expanded and the baby tested for yersinia<pathogen> , chlamydia<pathogen> , tuberculosis<disease> and bartonella<pathogen> , i.e. CSD. The postoperative wound<disease><symptom> healed soon and radiological bony lesions<symptom> began to resolve. After a month , we received a positive bartonella<pathogen> test result , the baby tested positively for <i> Bartonella<pathogen> henselae<pathogen> </i> IgG class , which confirmed past or active infection of CSD. A repeated test for <i> B.<pathogen> henselae<pathogen> </i> taken 6 months later showed a lower level of antibodies. It should be remembered that CSD , which is an extremely rare infection , can be diagnosed despite mediocre clinical and radiological manifestations. Thus , in the case of infections of unexplained aetiology and mediocre manifestations diagnostics should include testing for <i> Bartonella<pathogen> henselae<pathogen> </i>.
