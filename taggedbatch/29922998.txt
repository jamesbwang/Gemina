 We studied the effect of hormones estriol , ghrelin , kisspeptin , and chorionic gonadotropin in concentrations corresponding to their content in the peripheral blood in each trimester of pregnancy on the expression of membrane molecules on myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells of the thymus. It was found that thymic myeloid dendritic cells are sensitive to the action of estriol and kisspeptin. Estriol in a concentration of the first trimester of pregnancy reduces the number of myeloid dendritic cells expressing receptor for thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( CD11c + TSLP-R
