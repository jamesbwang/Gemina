 To determine the extent of treatment traces , the roughness depth , and the quantity of titanium nitride ( TiN) removed from the surface of CAD/CAM abutments after treatment with various instruments. Twelve TiN coated CAD/CAM abutments were investigated for an Manipulation with ultrasonic scalers resulted in a significant increase of average surface roughness ( Sa , Inappropriate instruments during regular plaque control may have an adverse effect on the integrity of the TiN coating of CAD/CAM abutments. To prevent defects and an increased surface roughness at the transmucosal zone of TiN abutments , only acrylic scaling instruments can be recommended for regular maintenance care.
