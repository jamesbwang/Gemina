 Acquired resistance to gefitinib remains a major challenge in cancer treatment. In the present study , the effect of exosomes on the transmission of gefitinib resistance from gefitinib-resistant HCC827 lung cancer cells ( H827R) to their gefitinib-sensitive counterparts and the potential underlying mechanisms by which this occurs was investigated. Exosomes were obtained from the cell supernatant using ultracentrifugation and the ExoQuick-TC exosome precipitation solution. Drug resistance was assessed by flow cytometry , apoptosis assays and cell counting kit-8 assays. The expression of microRNA ( miR) -21 was analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Exosomes released by H827R cells ( R/exo) may decrease the sensitivity of the human NSCLC HCC827 cell line to gefitinib. The results indicated that miR-21 expression was increased in R/exo and R/exo-treated H827S cells. However , miR-21 inhibition abrogated exosome-mediated drug resistance. Phosphorylated-protein kinase B ( p-Akt) , which is downstream of miR-21 , was downregulated following gefitinib treatment; however , R/exo pretreatment elevated p-Akt levels and promoted the activation of Akt. By contrast , miR-21 inhibition reduced p-Akt expression. Therefore , the induction of miR-21 via exosomes and the activation of Akt may be mechanisms by which exosomes mediate the transfer of drug resistance.
