 Studies indicate that the healthy Nordic diet may improve heart health , but its relation to weight change is less clear. We studied the association between the adherence to the healthy Nordic diet and long-term changes in weight , BMI and waist circumference. Furthermore , the agreement between self-reported and measured body anthropometrics was examined. The population-based DIetary , Lifestyle and Genetic Determinants of Obesity and Metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> Study in 2007 included 5024 Finns aged 25-75 years. The follow-up was conducted in 2014 ( n 3735). One-third of the participants were invited to a health examination. The rest were sent measuring tape and written instructions along with questionnaires. The Baltic Sea Diet Score ( BSDS) was used to measure adherence to the healthy Nordic diet. Association of the baseline BSDS and changes in BSDS during the follow-up with changes in body anthropometrics were examined using linear regression analysis. The agreement between self-reported and nurse-measured anthropometrics was determined with Bland-Altman analysis. Intra-class correlation coefficients between self-reported and nurse-measured anthropometrics exceeded 0 · 95. The baseline BSDS associated with lower weight ( β = -0 · 056 , P = 0 · 043) and BMI ( β = -0 · 021 , P = 0 · 031) over the follow-up. This association was especially evident among those who had increased their BSDS. In conclusion , both high initial and improved adherence to the healthy Nordic diet may promote long-term weight maintenance. The self-reported/measured anthropometrics were shown to have high agreement with nurse-measured values which adds the credibility of our results.
