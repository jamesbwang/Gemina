 Fruiting bodies of Amanita muscaria and topsoil beneath from six background areas in northern regions of Poland were investigated for the concentration levels of Ag , Al , Ba , Ca , Cd , Co , Cu , Fe , Hg , K , Mg , Mn , Na , Rb , Sr , and Zn. In addition , the bioconcentration factors ( BCF values) were studied for each of these metallic elements. Similar to studies from other basidiomycetes , A. muscaria showed species-specific affinities to some elements , resulting in their bioconcentration in mycelium and fruiting bodies. This mushroom growing in soils with different levels of the geogenic metallic elements ( Ag , Al , Ba , Ca , Co , Cu , Fe , Hg , K , Mg , Mn , Na , Rb , Sr , and Zn) showed signs of homeostatic accumulation in fruiting bodies of several of these elements , while Cd appeared to be accumulated at a rate dependent of the concentration level in the soil substrate. This species is an efficient bio-concentrator of K , Mg , Cd , Cu , Hg , Rb , and Zn and hence also contributes to the natural cycling of these metallic elements in forest<disease> ecosystems.
