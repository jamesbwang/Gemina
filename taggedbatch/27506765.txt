 The feed conversion ratio ( FCR) and residual feed intake ( RFI) are common indexes in measuring feed efficiency for livestock. RFI is a feed intake adjusted for requirements for maintenance and production so these two traits are related. Similarly , FCR is related to feed intake and weight gain because it is their ratio. Cholecystokinin type A receptor ( The feed intake ( FI) and body weights ( BW) of 1,841 individuals were monitored on a daily basis from 56 to 105 d of age. There was a strong correlation between RFI and average daily feed intake ( ADFI) and a negative correlation between the FCR and daily gain ( FCR is apply to weight selecting , and RFI is more appropriate if the breeding focus is feed intake.
