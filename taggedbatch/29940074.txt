 Symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legume root nodules<symptom> requires a steady supply of molybdenum for synthesis of the iron-molybdenum cofactor of nitrogenase. This nutrient has to be provided by the host plant from the soil , crossing several symplastically disconnected compartments through molybdate transporters , including members of the MOT1 family. Medicago truncatula Molybdate Transporter ( MtMOT) 1.2 is a Medicago truncatula MOT1 family member located in the endodermal cells in roots and nodules<symptom>. Immunolocalization of a tagged MtMOT1 .2 indicates that it is associated to the plasma membrane and to intracellular membrane systems , where it would be transporting molybdate towards the cytosol , as indicated in yeast transport assays. Loss-of-function mot1.2-1 mutant showed reduced growth compared with wild-type plants when nitrogen fixation was required but not when nitrogen was provided as nitrate. While no effect on molybdenum-dependent nitrate reductase activity was observed , nitrogenase activity was severely affected , explaining the observed difference of growth depending on nitrogen source. This phenotype was the result of molybdate not reaching the nitrogen-fixing nodules<symptom> , since genetic complementation with a wild-type MtMOT1 .2 gene or molybdate-fortification of the nutrient solution , both restored wild-type levels of growth and nitrogenase activity. These results support a model in which MtMOT1 .2 would mediate molybdate delivery by the vasculature into the nodules<symptom>.
