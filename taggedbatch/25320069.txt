 Insect behaviour is an important research topic in plant protection. To study insect behaviour accurately , it is necessary to observe and record their flight trajectory quantitatively and precisely in three dimensions ( 3D). The goal of this research was to analyse frames extracted from videos using Kernelized Correlation Filters ( KCF) and Background Subtraction ( BS) ( KCF-BS) to plot the 3D trajectory of cabbage butterfly ( P. rapae). Considering the experimental environment with a wind tunnel , a quadrature binocular vision insect video capture system was designed and applied in this study. The KCF-BS algorithm was used to track the butterfly in video frames and obtain coordinates of the target centroid in two videos. Finally the 3D trajectory was calculated according to the matching relationship in the corresponding frames of two angles in the video. To verify the validity of the KCF-BS algorithm , Compressive Tracking ( CT) and Spatio-Temporal Context Learning ( STC) algorithms were performed. The results revealed that the KCF-BS tracking algorithm performed more favourably than CT and STC in terms of accuracy and robustness.
