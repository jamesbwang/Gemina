 Marine net community production ( NCP) tracks uptake of carbon by plankton communities and its potential transport to depth. Relationships between marine microbial community composition and NCP currently remain unclear despite their importance for assessing how different taxa impact carbon export. We conducted 16 and 18S rRNA gene ( rDNA) sequencing on samples collected across the Western<pathogen> North Atlantic in parallel with high-resolution O
