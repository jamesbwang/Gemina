 Reliability of Near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS) , measuring indocyanine green ( ICG) for minimally invasive assessment of relative muscle<symptom> blood flow during exercise has been examined in fit young individuals , but not in COPD. Here we ask whether it could be used to evaluate respiratory and locomotor muscle perfusion in COPD patients. Vastus lateralis muscle<symptom> blood flow ( MBF , the reference method calculated from arterial and muscle ICG concentration curves) and a blood flow index ( BFI , calculated using only the ( same) muscle ICG concentration curves) were compared in 10 patients ( FEV
