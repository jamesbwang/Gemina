 To develop a safe and efficacious heat-stable rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine , new lyophilized formulations were developed using rotavirus<pathogen> serotypes constituting RotaTeq ®. A series of formulation compositions , differing in buffering agents , bulking agents , cryoprotectants , amino acids and divalent cations , were screened for their ability to provide stability to rotavirus<pathogen> serotypes during lyophilization and when stored under elevated temperatures for extended periods. Lead formulations and lyophilization cycles were further optimized. Stability profiles of thus optimized formulations showed their ability to retain the potency of rotavirus<pathogen> for > 36 months at 5 °C , 20 months at 37 °C , and 7 months at 45 °C. The heat-stable lyophilized rotavirus<pathogen> formulations developed met the all critical quality attributes for appearance , heat-stability during storage , moisture content as well as pH , viability and stability after reconstitution and has great potential to be used as vaccine candidates for improving access in low-income countries.
