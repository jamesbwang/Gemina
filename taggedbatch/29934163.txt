 Insects have recently emerged as a new protein source for both food and feed. Some studies have already demonstrated that insects ' meal can be successfully added to animal feed without threaten animals ' growth indices. However , effective and validated tests to individuate insects ' meal in feed are strongly needed to meet traceability and safety concerns and to support the European legislation under development. Spectroscopic techniques represent valuable rapid and non-destructive methods that can be applied for in-situ analysis in feed production plants or in farms. In this work a Fourier Transform Near Infrared spectroscopy imaging ( FT NIR) as a potential screening method for the detection and quantification of insects ' meal in feed is presented. Discriminant analysis was used for the automatic recognition of insects ' meal fragments into the feed matrix. Moreover , the possibility to quantify insect 's meal in feed sample was successfully tested. The proposed method is a rapid and green strategy for feed contamination screening analysis.
