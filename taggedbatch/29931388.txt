 Analytical band centrifugation ( ABC) is a powerful tool for the analysis of macromolecules and nanoparticles. Although it offers several advantages over the sedimentation velocity ( SV) experiment like a physical separation of the individual components and the possibility to perform chemical reactions , its analysis is still very restricted. Therefore , we investigated the integration of ABC data as an alternative approach , as this results in data similar to SV , which can then be evaluated by many established evaluation programs. We investigated this method using two different test systems , myoglobin as a biopolymer with significant diffusion and 100 nm polystyrene latex as a large particle with negligible diffusion , and found some limiting issues. These are namely , broadening of the initial boundary by diffusion of the sample , which can be taken into account and the dynamic density gradient between the solvent in the sector and the overlaid solution , which deforms the initial band upon movement through the gradient and is currently not taken into account. We show the influence these two factors have on the evaluation and show that it is possible to calculate the time-dependent change in solvent density and viscosity in the AUC cell using the integrated form of Fick 's second law. We conclude that taking the dynamic density gradient into account will open ABC for the sophisticated methods based on the analysis of the whole sedimentation boundary and not just the determination of an average sedimentation coefficient.
