 Regardless of national contexts , the institutions responsible for research ethics , founded on international regulations , are all expected to be structured and to operate in a common way. Our experience with several countries on different continents , however , has raised questions in this regard. This article examines the differences and structural weaknesses<symptom> of ethics committees in four countries ( Burkina Faso , Palestine , Peru , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) where we have conducted the same socio-anthropological study in the field of reproductive health. In addition to recording our observations during field surveys for this study , we performed a documentary review and interviewed expert members of ethics committees , research participants , and researchers who had experience with requesting ethics approvals for research protocols in the field of social sciences and health. The results of this study showed that , despite having the same mandate , the committees functioned differently , while they all exhibited the same weaknesses<symptom>. Thus , the universalization and standardization of institutional conditions for applying ethical standards in research still present problems that are , at the very least , relevant. This study on ethics committees in four countries demonstrated the profound influence of context on the ways in which different institutions function and enforce regulations. In effect , in all social fields , every innovation is infused by its context.
