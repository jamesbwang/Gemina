 The objective of the current study was to correlate the sensory and instrumental flavor analysis results of commercial orange juice ( OJ) products prepared by different processing methods. Descriptive analysis was conducted using a highly trained panel ( n = 6) to evaluate four OJs in triplicate. Volatile compounds associated with the four OJs were quantitatively and qualitatively identified using a Dynamic Headspace Sampling , followed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry analysis. The sensory characteristics of the four commercially available OJs were significantly different ( p < .05). OJs requiring refrigeration storage ( OJ3 and OJ4) had high intensity of orange peel flavor , and shelf-stable OJs ( OJ1 and OJ2) had high intensity of cooked orange flavor ( p < .05). Similarly , differences in volatile flavor profiles of 4 OJs were documented. The shelf-stable OJs ( OJ1 and OJ2) had desirable volatile flavor compounds , such as β-pinene , dl-limonene , linalool , nonalool , and decanal , and OJs requiring refrigeration had high levels of α- and β-terpineol.
