 In this study , we employed Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> with acs-22 mutation to examine the in vivo effect of functional deficit in intestinal barrier on toxicity and translocation of nanopolystyrene particles. Mutation of acs-22 leads to deficit in intestinal barrier. After prolonged exposure , nanopolystyrene particles at concentrations ≥ 1 μg/L could cause toxicity on acs-22 mutant nematodes. acs-22 mutation resulted in translocation of nanopolystyrene particles into targeted organs through intestinal barrier in nanopolystyrene particles ( 1 μg/L) exposed nematodes. After prolonged exposure , nanopolystyrene particles ( 1 μg/L) dysregulated expressions of some genes required for the control of oxidative stress and activated expression of Nrf signaling pathway. Therefore , under certain pathological conditions , our results suggest the potential toxicity of nanoplastic particles at predicted environmental concentration on organisms after long-term exposure.
