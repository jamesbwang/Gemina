 The risk of death after kidney transplant is associated with the age of the recipient , presence of comorbidities , socioeconomic status , local environmental characteristics and access to health care. To investigate the causes and risk factors associated with death during the first 5 years after kidney transplantation. This was a single-center , retrospective , matched case-control study. Using a consecutive cohort of 1,873 kidney transplant recipients from January 1st 2007 to December 31st 2009 , there were 162 deaths ( case group) , corresponding to 5-year patient survival of 91.4 %. Of these deaths , 25 % occurred during the first 3 months after transplant. The most prevalent cause of death was infectious ( 53 %) followed by cardiovascular ( 24 %). Risk factors associated with death were history of diabetes , dialysis type and time , unemployment , delayed graft function , number of visits to center , number of hospitalizations , and duration of hospital stay. After multivariate analysis , only time on dialysis , number of visits to center , and days in hospital were still associated with death. Patients who died had a non-significant higher number of treated acute rejection episodes ( 38 % vs. 29 % , p = 0.078) , higher mean number of adverse events per patient ( 5.1 ± 3.8 vs. 3.8 ± 2.9 , p = 0.194) , and lower mean eGFR at 3 months ( 50.8 ± 25.1 vs. 56.7 ± 20.7 , p = 0.137) and 48 months ( 45.9 ± 23.8 vs. 58.5 ± 20.2 , p = 0.368). This analysis confirmed that in this population , infection is the leading cause of mortality over the first 5 years after kidney transplantation. Several demographic and socioeconomic risk factors were associated with death , most of which are not readily modifiable.
