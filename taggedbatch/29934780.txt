 In the present pilot study , we questioned how eating to satiety affects cognitive influences on the desire for food and corresponding neuronal activity in the obese female brain. During EEG recording , lean ( n = 10) and obese women ( n = 10) self-rated the ability to reappraise visually presented food. All women were measured twice , when hungry and after eating to satiety. After eating to satiety , reappraisal of food was easier than when being hungry. Comparing the EEG data of the sated to the hungry state , we found that only in obese women the frontal operculum was involved not only in the reappraisal of food but also in admitting the desire for the same food. The right frontal operculum in the obese female brain , assumed to primarily host gustatory processes , may be involved in opposing cognitive influences on the desire for food. These findings may help to find potential brain targets for non-invasive brain stimulation or neurofeedback studies that aim at modulating the desire for food.
