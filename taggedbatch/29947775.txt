 Vitamin D may be a modifiable risk factor for inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD). We tested the hypothesis that plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are causally associated with risk of Crohn 's disease ( CD) and ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC). We used a Mendelian randomization design in 120 013 individuals from the Copenhagen City Heart Study , the Copenhagen General Population Study , and a Copenhagen-based IBD patient cohort. 35 558 individuals had plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurements available , and 115 110 were genotyped for rs7944926 and rs11234027 in DHCR7 and rs10741657 and rs12794714 in CYP2R1; all variants associated with plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. We identified 653 cases of CD and 1265 of UC , of which 58 and 113 had 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurements available. We also included genetic data from 408 455 individuals from the UK Biobank including 1707 CD cases and 3147 UC cases. Hazard ratios for higher plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for 10 nmol/L higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D were 1.04 ( 95 % confidence interval: 0.93-1.16) for CD and 1.13 ( 1.06-1.21) for UC. A combined 25-hydroxyvitamin D allele score was associated with a 1.4 nmol/l increase in plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and hazard ratios of 0.98 ( 0.94-1.03) for CD and 1.01 ( 0.97-1.05) for UC. Combining genetic data from Copenhagen studies and the UK Biobank , genetically determined vitamin D did not appear to influence risk of CD or UC. Our results do not support a major role for vitamin D deficiency in the development of IBD.
