 A hierarchically core/shell-structured TS-1@silica/ carbon composite material , synthesized from titanosilicate crystals and surfactant-mediated mesosilica/resol precursors via a self-assembly and nanocasting route , was fabricated to produce stable oil-water-solid Pickering emulsions in alkene/H2O2 media , exhibiting attractive interfacial activity and stability for selective epoxidation of alkenes.
