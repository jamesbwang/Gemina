 The review provides an overview on latest methodological strategies to assess mitochondrial respiratory function in tissue biopsies or blood cells. In addition , it summarizes the recent literature related to this topic. Today , the study of mitochondrial function in key metabolic active tissues has been become more relevant , with increasing focus in clinical applications. In addition , assessment of mitochondrial function in blood cells by respirometry might be a sensitive biomarker of disease progression. High-Resolution Respirometry provides a modern tool to study mitochondrial respiratory physiology which allows direct measurement of cellular metabolic function during health and disease. Moreover , standard operating procedures are required regarding instrumental settings , sample collection and preparation , protocol design and respirometric data analysis of mitochondrial respiratory function in tissue biopsies ( such as skeletal muscle , liver and adipose tissue) , as well as isolated blood cells. Mitochondrial function is a key factor in many metabolic diseases. Although various analytical approaches are available , certain well-established protocols for isolated mitochondria are limited for the analysis of mitochondrial function in tissue biopsies or blood cells. Thus , cautious considerations in selecting appropriate protocols and analytical endpoints are crucial for the interpretation of the gained data and to draw robust conclusions.
