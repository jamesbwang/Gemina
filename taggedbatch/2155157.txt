 Recent evidence suggests that horizontal transfer plays a significant role in the evolution of of transposable elements ( TEs) in eukaryotes. Many cases of horizontal TE transfer ( HTT) been reported in animals and plants , however surprisingly few examples of HTT have been reported in fungi<pathogen>. Here I report evidence for a novel HTT event in fungi<pathogen> involving This work shows that comprehensive analysis of TE sequences in essentially-complete genome assemblies derived from long-read sequencing provides new opportunities to detect HTT events in fungi<pathogen> and other organisms. This work also provides support for the hypothesis that HTT and subsequent TE proliferation can induce genome rearrangements that contribute to post-zygotic isolation in yeast.
