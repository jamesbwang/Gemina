 To evaluate the effect of prenatal mobile phone exposure on the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA) and doublecortin ( DCX) in dentate gyrus of offspring rats. The rat model of prenatal mobile phone exposure was established and there were three groups including control group , short term maternal exposure group and long term maternal exposure group ( There was no difference in length of pregnancy , maternal body<symptom> weight gain , litter size and pup 's body<symptom> weight among three groups. The morphological changes of pyramidal cells in the polymorphic layer and DCX-positive cells in the dentate gyrus were obvious in rat offspring of long term maternal exposure group. There were less PCNA-positive cells in dentate gyrus and decreased expression of DCX and BDNF in hippocampus by Western blot in long term maternal exposure group compared with control and short term maternal exposure group ( all Long term prenatal mobile phone exposure might inhibit the expression of PCNA and DCX in dentate gyrus of rat offspring by down-regulating BDNF.
