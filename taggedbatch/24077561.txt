 The first electron microscope was constructed in 1931. Several decades later , techniques were developed to allow the first ultrastructural analysis of microglia by transmission electron microscopy ( EM). In the 50 years that followed , important roles of microglia have been identified , specifically due to the ultrastructural resolution currently available only with EM. In particular , the addition of electron-dense staining using immunohistochemical EM methods has allowed the identification of microglial cell bodies , as well as processes , which are difficult to recognize in EM , and to uncover their complex interactions with neurons and synapses. The ability to recognize neuronal , astrocytic , and oligodendrocytic compartments in the neuropil without any staining is another invaluable advantage of EM over light microscopy for studying intimate cell-cell contacts. The technique has been essential in defining microglial interactions with neurons and synapses , thus providing , among other discoveries , important insights into their roles in synaptic stripping and pruning
