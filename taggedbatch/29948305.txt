 The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the effect of skeletal muscle and body fat on liver function in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) diagnosed by liver biopsy. Among the 219 patients with NAFLD enrolled in this study was a cohort of 139 patients who had their body composition measured with Inbody720 at baseline and at â‰¥ 1 year postbaseline , to elucidate the relationship between liver function and changes in skeletal muscle and body fat mass. Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors influencing low skeletal muscle mass index ( SMI , defined as 7 kg/m Of the 219 patients enrolled , 27 ( 12.3 %) had a low SMI. Patient age ( > 70 years) and female gender were identified as risk factors for low SMI. Hepatic fibrosis<disease> was not associated with SMI. In the cohort followed up at baseline and 12 months later , transaminase activity , body fat mass , and SMI significantly decreased over time. Changes in the SF ratio were significantly associated with changes in liver function. An increase in the SF ratio ( hazard ratio ( HR) 10.99 in men , 6.849 in women) was a predictor of reduced ALT , independent of age and other backgrounds. In the patients with NAFLD , SMI was decreased , even in the early stages of NAFLD. Therapeutic strategies for NAFLD require a reduction in body fat mass and the maintenance of skeletal muscle is also needed.
