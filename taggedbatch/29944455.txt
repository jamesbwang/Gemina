 Infestation of Triticum ( wheat) plants by their pest Rhopalosiphum maidis ( corn leaf aphid) causes severe vegetative damage. Despite the agro-economic importance of wheat , the metabolic diversity of Triticum turgidum ( tetraploid wheat) in response to aphid attack has not been sufficiently addressed. In this study , we compared the metabolic diversity of two tetraploid wheat genotypes , domesticated and wild emmer. The plants were grown in a control growth room and infested with aphids for 96 h. Our untargeted metabolic analysis performed on plants with and without aphids revealed massive differences between the two genotypes. The targeted metabolic analysis highlighted the differences in the biosynthesis of phytohormones. The aphid progeny was lower in the cultivated durum<pathogen> wheat than in the wild emmer wheat. Overall , these observations emphasize the potential of using the natural diversity of wheat species to better understand the metabolic responses to pest damage.
