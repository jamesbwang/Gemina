 Nowadays , it is still questionable whether denatured collagen ( DCol) can replace the native collagen ( Col<pathogen>) as a bioactive protein in cartilage engineering. We sought to study the advantages of Col<pathogen> with a triple-helical structure in the collagen-based composite materials for cartilage engineering. We presented new three-dimensional ( 3D) Col<pathogen> and DCol scaffolds with shape memory properties. The effects of Col<pathogen> and DCol scaffolds on rabbit chondrocytes ' proliferation , adhesion , differentiation and interaction with matrix were investigated. Tissue compatibility was performed in a subcutaneous Sprague Dawley ( SD) rat model. The repair ability of different scaffolds with chondrocytes for full-thickness articular cartilage defects in knee joints of New Zealand white rabbits were investigated. The results indicated that the Col<pathogen> scaffolds ( with concentration 1.6 wt % and 0.8 wt % , respectively) promoted the proliferation , adhesion and redifferentiation of chondrocytes , as well as chondrocyte-matrix interaction , to a greater degree than the DCol scaffolds. In the animal experiment , the Col<pathogen> scaffolds filled in the defect hole significantly maintained chondrocytes function , promoted cartilage and subchondral bone regeneration , compared with the DCol scaffolds , and the scaffolds loaded with chondrocytes were better than the cell-free scaffolds , especially in the case of the Col<pathogen> scaffolds ( 1.6 wt %). Taken together , these insights suggest that the better proliferation , adhesion and redifferentiation of chondrocytes in Col scaffolds with the triple-helical structure may contribute to the greater cartilage repair ability. Col<pathogen> scaffolds may be more appropriate for repairing cartilage defects than DCol scaffolds , and DCol can not as an alternative when using collagen-based materials for cartilage engineering applications.
