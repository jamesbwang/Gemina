 To determine the rate of optimal cytoreduction in patients with advanced ovarian cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with dose-dense carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by interval debulking surgery ( IDS). A retrospective study of a series of cases of Peruvian women treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin ( 6 AUC mg/mL/min) and paclitaxel ( 80 mg/m2 weekly) followed by IDS , at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases during the 2010-2014 period. The 41 patients who made it to the interval surgery had a median age of 59 years ( range: 47-73 years). In 37 ( 90.2 %) patients , high-grade serous adenocarcinoma histology was reported. Thirty-four ( 82.9 %) achieved optimal cytoreduction and five ( 14.7 %) , a complete pathological response. Progression-free survival at one year and two years was 74.7 % and 51.8 % , respectively. Overall survival at one year and two years was 85.2 % and 71.4 % , respectively. The risk of progression and death was greater in patients without optimal cytoreduction and in patients with postsurgery levels of carcinoembryonic antigen 125 > 30 U/mL. Neoadjuvant therapy with dose-dense carboplatin and paclitaxel achieved an elevated frequency of optimal cytoreduction. The post-surgery levels of carcinoembryonic antigen 125 and optimal cytoreduction were independent factors of progression-free survival and overall survival.
