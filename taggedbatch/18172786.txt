 Combination chemotherapy is a rational strategy to increase patient response and tolerability and to decrease adverse effects and drug resistance. Recently , the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) has been reported to be associated with reduction in occurrence of a variety of cancers including lung cancer. On the other hand , growing evidences suggest that deuterium-enriched water ( DEW , D2O) and deuterium-depleted water ( DDW) play a role both in treatment and prevention of cancers. In the present study , we examined the effects of DEW and DDW in combination with two NSAIDs , celecoxib and indomethacin , on A549 human non-small lung cancer cell to identify novel treatment options. The cytotoxicity of celecoxib or indomethacin , alone and in combination with DDW and DEW was determined. The COX-2 , MAPK pathway proteins , the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and pro-apoptotic Bax proteins and caspase-3 activity were studied for cytotoxic combinations. Co-administration of selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitors with DEW led to a remarkable increase in cytotoxicity and apoptosis of A549 cells. These events were associated with activation of p38 and JNK MAPKs and decreasing pro-survival proteins Bcl-2 , COX-2 and ERK1/2. Furthermore , the combination therapy activated caspase-3 , and the apoptosis mediator , and disabled poly ADP-ribose polymerase ( PARP) , the key DNA repair enzyme , by cleaving it. The combination of DEW with NSAIDs might be effective against lung cancer cells by influence on principal cell signalling pathways , and this has a potential to become a candidate for chemotherapy.
