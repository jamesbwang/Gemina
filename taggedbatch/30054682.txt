 Membrane organic anion-transporting polypeptides ( OATPs) are responsible for the drug transmembrane transport within the human body. The function of OATP2B1 transporter can be inhibited by various natural compounds. Despite increased research interest in soya as a part of human diet , the effect of its active components to interact with hOATP2B1 has not been elucidated in a complex extent. This in vitro study examined the inhibitory effect of main soy isoflavones ( daidzin , daidzein , genistin , genistein , glycitin , glycitein , biochanin A , formononetin) and their metabolites formed in vivo ( S-equol , O-desmethylangolensin) towards human OATP2B1 transporter. MDCKII cells overexpressing hOATP2B1 were employed to determine quantitative inhibitory parameters of the tested compounds and to analyze mechanism/s of the inhibitory interaction. The study showed that aglycones of soy isoflavones and the main biologically active metabolite S-equol were able to significantly inhibit hOATP2B1-mediated transport. The K
