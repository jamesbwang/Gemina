 Adolescents and young adults ( AYAs) have unique needs and important biopsychosocial differences when compared with older adults who use substances. As their brains continue to develop , youth are especially susceptible to the reinforcing effects of substances in the context of a still-developing capacity for executive control and decision making. In this article , the authors highlight key differences in the neurobiologic , epidemiologic , and relational aspects of substance use found in AYA. They also discuss how best to engage with youth who use substances and how prevention and intervention can be adapted for optimal effectiveness for this distinct and high-risk population.
