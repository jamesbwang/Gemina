 To analyse the quality of three processed products of Rhizome of Curcuma wenyujin by establishing an ultra performance liquid chromatography ( UPLC) method for simultaneously determining five sesquiterpene components in three processed products of rhizome of C. wenyujin and establishing UPLC fingerprints. Component determination was achieved on Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C ₁₈ column （ 2.1 mm × 50 mm , 1.7 μm) , with acetonitrile-water as mobile phase for gradient elution. The flow rate was 0.3 mL · min ⁻¹; column temperature was 30 °C; the detection wavelength was set at 214 nm and injection volume was 1 μL. The similarity was analyzed with `` Similarity Evaluation System for Chromatographic Fingerprint of Chinese Materia Medica ( 2012.130723) '' , and hydrophobic cluster analysis ( HCA) , principal components analysis ( PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis ( OPLS-DA) were conducted by using simca-p14.1 software to investigate the differences in components among these three kinds of processed products. The curzerene , curdione , curcumol , germacrone , furanodiene and β-elemene showed good linearity relationship with chromatographic peak area within the ranges of 10.8-320 （
