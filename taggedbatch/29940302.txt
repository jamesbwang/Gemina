 High styrene exposures are still experienced in various occupational settings , requesting regular exposure assessments. The aims of this study were to study occupational exposures in various industrial sectors and to determine factors influencing styrene urinary metabolites levels. Biomonitoring was conducted in 141 workers from fiberglass-reinforced plastic ( FRP) manufacture , thermoplastic polymers production , vehicle repair shops and cured-in-place pipe lining ( CIPP). Urinary styrene ( StyU) as well as Mandelic ( MA)/ Phenyglyoxylic Acids ( PGA) were quantified at the beginning and at the end of week , and multivariate linear regression models were used. StyU levels revealed very low , rarely exceeding 3 Âµg.L Intervention on process ( decreasing styrene proportion , using closed molding) , protective equipment ( local exhaust ventilation , respiratory protection) and individual practices ( stringent safety rules) are expected to decrease occupational exposures. Urinary MA + PGA remain the most appropriate biomarkers for occupational biomonitoring.
