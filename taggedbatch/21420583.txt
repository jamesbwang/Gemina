 Intraocular lenses with variable total diameter are supposed to fit better in the capsular bag and lead to fewer complications. This study aims to investigate the efficacy and the safety of an intraocular lens model with variable total diameter. Prospective randomized intraindividual study. Thirty-two eyes of sixteen patients with bilateral age-related cataract received standard cataract surgery with implantation of an intraocular lens with a standard diameter in one eye ( Quatrix ® , Group A) and with a variable total diameter in the fellow eye ( Quatrix Evolutive ® , Group B). Primary study endpoints included evaluation of refraction stability and posterior capsule opacification ( PCO) over a follow-up period of 6 months. SPSS ( Version 19.0) was used for statistical analysis. Uncorrected and corrected distant visual acuity after 6 months were 0.24 and 0.1 LogMAR in Group A and 0.23 and 0.09 LogMAR in Group B , respectively. The objective and manifest spherical equivalent ( OSE , MSE) 6 months postoperatively were + 0.65 D and + 0.62 D in Group A compared to + 0.33 D and + 0.33 D in Group B respectively ( An intraocular lens with a variable total diameter shows good visual outcomes and safety performance as well as same outcomes concerning postoperative refractive stability and development of PCO compared to an intraocular lens with standard total diameter.
