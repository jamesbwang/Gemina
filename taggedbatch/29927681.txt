 Hazardous drinking is associated with other risky behaviors and negative health-related outcomes. This study examined co-variation between hazardous drinking scores and the following risky driving behaviors: falling asleep while driving , texting ( receiving and sending) while driving , and driving after consuming alcohol. The participants in this study were a sample of undergraduate students ( N = 1,298) who were enrolled in an introductory health course at a large , Southeastern university in Spring 2016 and completed an online health survey that assessed hazardous drinking , falling asleep while driving , texting while driving , and driving after consuming alcohol. We conducted a series of two-step regression analyses to examine co-variation between hazardous drinking scores ( using the AUDIT-C) and the risky driving behaviors of interest. We found that the majority of participants did not drink and drive ( 91.8 %) nor did they fall asleep while driving ( 80.4 %); however , the majority did read a text while driving ( 81.7 %) and sent a text while driving ( 75.3 %). In the full multivariable model , hazardous drinking score was positively associated with drinking and driving ( Step 2 OR = 1.28 , 95 % CI: 1.18 , 1.38) and sending a text message while driving ( Step 2 b = 0.19 , p = .01). Hazardous drinking score was also positively associated with reading a text while driving ( Step 1 b = 0.14 , p < .001) and falling asleep while driving ( Step 1 b = 0.02 , p = .02) in the model only controlling for demographic characteristics. The analyses also indicated co-variability between the following risky driving behaviors: ( 1) drinking and driving/reading a text message while driving , ( 2) drinking and driving/falling asleep and driving , ( 3) reading a text while driving/sending a text while driving , and ( 4) sending a text while driving/sleeping and driving. The findings of this study indicate a need for interventions discouraging both hazardous drinking and risky driving behaviors in college student populations; recommendations to reduce risky driving and hazardous drinking are discussed.
