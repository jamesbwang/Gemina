 To examine factors that account for women veterans ' higher prevalence of past-year DSM-5 posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) compared to women civilians and men veterans. Cross-sectional analyses of the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III ( NESARC-III). Face-to-face interviews with 379 women veterans , 20,007 women civilians , and 2740 men veterans were conducted. Trauma type ( child abuse , interpersonal violence , combat or war zone , and other) , number of trauma types , past-year stressful life events , current social support , and DSM-5 PTSD were assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-5. Generalized linear models were used that accounted for the complex survey design. Women veterans had a higher unadjusted prevalence of past-year PTSD ( 11.40 %) compared to their civilian ( 5.96 %) and male ( 5.19 %) counterparts. Individual predictor models indicated that the difference between women veterans ' and civilians ' prevalence of PTSD was attenuated when adjusting for number of trauma types , whereas the difference between men and women veterans was attenuated when adjusting for child abuse , interpersonal violence , and stressful life events. Nonetheless , while full adjustment in a multiple predictor model accounted for the difference in PTSD between women veterans and civilians , gender differences between men and women veterans remained. Number of trauma types , type of trauma , and social factors may together help explain women veterans ' higher PTSD prevalence compared to women civilians , but do not fully account for differences between men and women veterans. Results highlight a need to explore additional explanatory factors and evaluate associations with longitudinal data.
