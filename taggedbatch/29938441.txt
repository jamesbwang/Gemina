 Less than 100 cases of gestational gigantomastia have been described in literature. The aetiology and risk factors are not well-established. Various treatments have been used with some consensus. We present the case of a 47-year-old female who presented to us with bilateral gigantomastia in her 16th week of gestation. She had massively enlarged breasts<disease> which were very painful. Relevant laboratory investigations were normal. An incisional biopsy done prior to , and two trucut samples at presentation to us , showed normal breast tissue proliferation. In the absence of adequate pain control , it was decided to electively terminate the pregnancy and give a trial of tamoxifen. She made a rapid recovery following termination without requiring the use of tamoxifen.
