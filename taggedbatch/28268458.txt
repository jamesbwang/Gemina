 Cryptographic frameworks depend on key sharing for ensuring security of data. While the keys in cryptographic frameworks must be correctly reproducible and not unequivocally connected to the identity of a user , in biometric frameworks this is different. Joining cryptography techniques with biometrics can solve these issues. We present a biometric authentication method based on the discrete logarithm problem and Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem ( BCH) codes , perform its security analysis , and demonstrate its security characteristics. We evaluate a biometric cryptosystem using our own dataset of electroencephalography ( EEG) data collected from 42 subjects. The experimental results show that the described biometric user authentication system is effective , achieving an Equal Error Rate ( ERR) of 0.024.
