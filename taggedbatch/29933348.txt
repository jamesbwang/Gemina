 Cross-sectional studies suggest that training can increase muscle carnosine ( MCarn) , although longitudinal studies have failed to confirm this. A lack of control for dietary β-alanine intake or muscle fibre type shifting may have hampered their conclusions. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of high-intensity interval training ( HIIT) on MCarn. Twenty vegetarian men were randomly assigned to a control ( CON; n = 10) or HIIT ( n = 10) group. HIIT was carried out on a cycle ergometer for 12 weeks , with progressive volume ( 6-12 series) and intensity ( 140-170 % lactate threshold ( LT)). MCarn was quantified in whole-muscle and individual fibres; expression of selected genes ( CARNS , CNDP2 , ABAT , TauT and PAT1) and muscle buffering capacity in vitro ( βmin vitro) were also determined. Exercise tests were performed to evaluate total work done ( TWD) , VO2max , ventilatory thresholds ( VT) and LT. TWD , VT , LT , VO2max and βmin vitro were improved in the HIIT group ( all P < 0.05) , but not in CON ( p > 0.05). MCarn ( in mmol · kg dry<symptom> muscle) increased in the HIIT ( 15.8 ± 5.7 to 20.6 ± 5.3; p = 0.012) but not the CON group ( 14.3 ± 5.3 to 15.0 ± 4.9; p = 0.99). In type I fibres , MCarn increased in the HIIT ( from 14.4 ± 5.9 to 16.8 ± 7.6; p = 0.047) but not the CON group ( from 14.0 ± 5.5 to 14.9 ± 5.4; p = 0.99). In type IIa fibres , MCarn increased in the HIIT group ( from 18.8 ± 6.1 to 20.5 ± 6.4; p = 0.067) but not the CON group ( from 19.7 ± 4.5 to 18.8 ± 4.4; p = 0.37). No changes in gene expression were shown. In the absence of any dietary intake of β-alanine , HIIT increased MCarn content. The contribution of increased MCarn to the total increase in βmin vitro appears to be small.
