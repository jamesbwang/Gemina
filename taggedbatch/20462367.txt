 Transthyretin ( TTR) is a globular tetrameric transport protein in plasma. Nearly 140 single amino acid substitutions in TTR cause life-threatening amyloid disease. We report a one-of-a-kind pathological variant featuring a Glu51 , Ser52 duplication mutation ( Glu51_Ser52dup). The proband , heterozygous for the mutation , exhibited an unusually aggressive amyloidosis that was refractory to treatment with the small-molecule drug diflunisal. To understand the poor treatment response and expand therapeutic options , we explored the structure and stability of recombinant Glu51_Ser52dup. The duplication did not alter the protein secondary or tertiary structure but decreased the stability of the TTR monomer and tetramer. Diflunisal , which bound with near-micromolar affinity , partially restored tetramer stability. The duplication had no significant effect on the free energy and enthalpy of diflunisal binding , and hence on the drug-protein interactions. However , the duplication induced tryptic digestion of TTR at near-physiological conditions , releasing a C-terminal fragment 49-129 that formed amyloid fibrils under conditions in which the full-length protein did not. Such C-terminal fragments , along with the full-length TTR , comprise amyloid deposits in vivo. Bioinformatics and structural analyses suggested that increased disorder in the surface loop , which contains the Glu51_Ser52dup duplication , not only helped generate amyloid-forming fragments but also decreased structural protection in the amyloidogenic residue segment 25-34 , promoting misfolding of the full-length protein. Our studies of a unique duplication mutation explain its diflunisal-resistant nature , identify misfolding pathways for amyloidogenic TTR variants , and provide therapeutic targets to inhibit amyloid fibril formation by variant TTR.
