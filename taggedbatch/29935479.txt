 Methylphenidate ( MPH) , which is metabolized into ritalinic acid ( RA) , is an amphetamine derivative largely used in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder , a neurological condition commonly diagnosed in early childhood. Ensuring that patients comply with clinical treatment is crucial and compliance is generally monitored in blood or urine specimens which , especially in the case of children , can be challenging to obtain on a repetitive basis. Here we report validation of a specific , non-invasive , and rapid dilute-and-shoot analytical method for the detection and quantitation of MPH and RA in oral fluid ( OF). The method is based on liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole MS with electrospray ionization utilizing dynamic MRM mode. Subject OF specimens were collected using a Quantisal â„¢ device , processed , and diluted for analysis with seven-point quadratic calibration curves ( weighting of 1/x) using MPH-d
