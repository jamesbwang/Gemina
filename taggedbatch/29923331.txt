 Ethyl glucuronide ( EtG) and ethyl sulphate ( EtS) are 2 non-oxidative and direct metabolites of ethanol. EtG is known to accumulate in hair and has proved to be a reliable biomarker for detection of chronic alcohol consumption. EtS has been analysed in blood and urine but has never been reported in hair. This article presents the first analytical assay based on liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry for the quantification of EtS in hair. Sample preparation , chromatographic , and mass spectrometric parameters , such as solid-phase extraction , column type , and transitions were optimised. The method was validated according to the guidelines of the European Medicine Agency , fulfilling the requirements for limit of quantification ( LOQ) , linearity , accuracy , precision , carry-over , matrix effects , and recovery. Linearity ranged from 5 to 500 pg mg
