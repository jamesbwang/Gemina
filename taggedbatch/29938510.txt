 A one-step preparation of 1,1-dimethylallyl ( DMA) esters was optimized for the C-terminal protection of a range of Fmoc-protected amino acids. This preparation is not sensitive to the scale of reaction and affords the corresponding DMA esters in 70-99 % yield with high regioselectivity. Additionally , these DMA-protected amino acids were used with the backbone amide linker ( BAL) of Albericio and Barany and found to resist diketopiperazine formation during the synthesis of a series of tripeptide esters. C-terminal DMA protection is compatible with the BAL linkage and allows for standard Fmoc-based methods to be used throughout the synthesis.
