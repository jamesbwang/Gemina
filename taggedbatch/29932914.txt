 G protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR) activation-mediated PKA and PKC pathways have been recognized to be important in ovarian physiology. Expression of regulator of G-protein signaling 2 ( RGS2) has been reported in ovarian granulosa<pathogen> cells. The detailed mechanisms in PKA- and PKC-regulated RGS2 expression and cellular translocation in granulosa<pathogen> cells remain mostly unclear. PKA activator 8-bromo-cAMP and PKC activator phorbol-12 , 13-didecanoate appeared to rapidly elevate both protein and mRNA levels and promoter activation of RGS2 gene. Two consensus Sp1 elements within the shortest 78 bp fragment of RGS2 promoter sequence were essential for the full responsiveness to PKA and PKC. PKC activation appeared to increase the RGS2 translocation from nucleus to cytosol. PKA- and PKC-mediated RGS2 transcription in a Sp-1-dependent manner and a PKC-mediated RGS2 intracellular translocation were noted in granulosa<pathogen> cells.
