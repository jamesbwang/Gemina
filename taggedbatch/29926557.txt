 Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration ( EBUS-TBNA) is a standard procedure to evaluate suspicious lymph node involvement of lung cancer because computed tomography ( CT) and ¹⁸ F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-CT ( PET-CT) have limitations in their sensitivity and specificity. There are a number of benign causes of false positive lymph node such as anthracosis or anthracofibrosis , pneumoconiosis , old or active tuberculosis<disease> , interstitial lung disease , and other infectious conditions including pneumonia<disease>. The purpose of this study was to evaluate possible causes of false positive lymph node detected in chest CT or PET-CT. Two hundred forty-seven patients who were initially diagnosed with lung cancer between May 2009 and December 2012 , and underwent EBUS-TBNA to confirm suspicious lymph node involvement by chest CT or PET-CT were analyzed for the study. Of 247 cases , EBUS-TBNA confirmed malignancy in at least one lymph node in 189. The remaining 58 patients whose EBUS-TBNA results were negative were analyzed. Age ≥ 65 , squamous cell carcinoma as the histologic type , and pneumoconiosis were related with false-positive lymph node involvement on imaging studies such as chest CT and PET-CT. These findings suggest that lung cancer staging should be done more carefully when a patient has clinically benign lymph node characteristics including older age , squamous cell carcinoma , and benign lung conditions.
