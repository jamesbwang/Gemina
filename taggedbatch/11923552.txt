 Nutritional abnormalities are frequent in different chronic respiratory<disease> diseases<disease> such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) , bronchiectasis , cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) , interstitial fibrosis<disease> and lung cancer , having important clinical consequences. However , nutritional abnormalities often remained underdiagnosed due to the relative lack of awareness of health professionals. Therefore , systematic anthropometry or even better , assessment of body composition , should be performed in all patients with chronic respiratory conditions , especially following exacerbation periods when malnutrition becomes more accentuated. Nutritional abnormalities very often include the loss of muscle mass , which is an important factor for the occurrence of muscle<symptom> dysfunction<symptom>. The latter can be easily detected with the specific assessment of muscle strength and endurance , and also negatively influences patients ' quality of life and prognosis. Both nutritional abnormalities and muscle<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> result from the interaction of several factors , including tobacco smoking , low physical activity-sedentarism , systemic inflammation<symptom> and the imbalance between energy supply and requirements , which essentially lead to a negative balance<symptom> between protein breakdown and synthesis. Therapeutic approaches include improvements in lifestyle , nutritional supplementation and training. Anabolic drugs may be administered in some cases.
