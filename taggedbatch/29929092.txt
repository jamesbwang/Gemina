 To investigate the outcome following adjuvant doxorubicin and ifosfamide in a prospective non-randomised study based on a soft<disease> tissue sarcoma<disease> ( STS) patient subgroup defined by specific morphological characteristics previously shown to be at a high-risk of metastatic relapse. The expected 5-year cumulative incidence of metastases in patients with this risk profile has previously been reported to be about 50 % without adjuvant chemotherapy. High-risk STS was defined as high-grade morphology ( according to the Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer ( FNCLCC) grade II-III) and either vascular invasion or at least two of the following criteria: tumour size ≥ 8.0 cm , infiltrative growth and necrosis<symptom>. Six cycles of doxorubicin ( 60 mg/m For the 150 eligible patients , median follow-up time for metastases-free survival was 3.9 years ( range 0.2-8.7). Five-year metastases-free survival ( MFS) was 70.4 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 63.1-78.4) with a local recurrence rate of 14.0 % ( 95 % CI: 7.8-20.2). For overall survival ( OS) , the median follow-up time was 4.4 years ( range: 0.2-8.7). The five-year OS was 76.1 % ( 95 % CI: 68.8-84.2). Tumour size , deep location and reduced dose intensity ( < 80 %) had a negative impact on survival. Toxicity was moderate with no treatment-related death. A benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy , compared to similar historical control groups , was demonstrated in STS patients with defined poor prognostic factors. Vascular invasion , tumour size , growth pattern and necrosis<symptom> may identify patients in need of adjuvant chemotherapy.
