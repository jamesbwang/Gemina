 In this paper , the influences of the graphite precursor and the oxidation method on the resulting reduced graphene oxide ( especially its composition and morphology) are shown. Three types of graphite were used to prepare samples for analysis , and each of the precursors was oxidized by two different methods ( all samples were reduced by the same method of thermal reduction). Each obtained graphite oxide and reduced graphene oxide was analysed by X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) and Raman spectroscopy ( RS).
