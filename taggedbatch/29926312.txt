 The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro biocompatibility of Reguneal ™ , a new bicarbonate containing peritoneal dialysis fluid ( PDF) for Japan , and compare it with other PDFs available in that country. We assessed basal cytotoxicity using in vitro proliferation of cultured fibroblasts , L-929 , determining the quantity of living cells by the uptake of Neutral Red. Levels of ten glucose degradation products ( GDPs) were measured by a validated ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography method in combination with an ultraviolet detector. We compared inhibition of fibroblast cell growth between brands of PDF , adjusting for dextrose and GDP concentrations using random-effects mixed models. The results demonstrate that cytotoxicity of Reguneal ™ is comparable to a sterile-filtered control and is less cytotoxic than most of the other PDFs , most of which significantly inhibited cell growth. As a `` class effect '' , increasing dextrose and GDP concentrations were non-significantly but positively associated with cytotoxicity. As a `` brand effect '' , these relationships varied widely between brands , and some PDFs had significant residual effects on basal cytotoxicity through mechanisms that were unassociated with either dextrose or GDP concentration. Our study suggests that Reguneal ™ is a biocompatible PDF. The results of our study also highlight that dextrose and GDPs are important for biocompatibility , but alone are not a complete surrogate. The results of our study need to be confirmed in other tissue culture models , and should lead to further research on determinants of biocompatibility and the effect of such PDFs on clinical outcomes.
