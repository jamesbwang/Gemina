 To determine the duration of the low hypoglycaemia risk period after the start of moderate-intensity exercise performed under basal insulinaemic conditions and whether this period is affected by the level at which glycaemia is maintained under these conditions. This was a prospective , randomized counterbalanced study. Eight participants with Type 1 diabetes ( mean ± sd age 21.5 ± 4.0 years) underwent either a euglycaemic ( 5-6 mmol/l) or hyperglycaemic clamp ( 9-10 mmol/l) on separate days and were infused with insulin at basal rates and ( 6,6- During the first 20 min of exercise , the glucose infusion rate did not increase significantly , irrespective of the level at which glycaemia was maintained , but increased acutely between 20 and 25 min under both conditions. Maintaining higher glycaemia resulted in higher glucose infusion rate during , but not early post-exercise. With the exception of epinephrine , the glucoregulatory hormone levels and rates of glucose appearance and disappearance were similar between conditions. Irrespective of the levels at which glycaemia is maintained , there is a 20-min low exogenous glucose demand period during which the exogenous glucose requirements to maintain stable glycaemia do not increase during moderate exercise performed at basal insulin level.
