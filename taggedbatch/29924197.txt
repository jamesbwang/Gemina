 Here we report the case of a 78-year-old male patient with a 2-day history of low visual acuity and fundus and who was diagnosed with central retinal artery occlusion. In addition , the patient had an allergy to fluorescein. A fundus examination of the left eye found a pink optic disc with blurred margins , diffuse pallor in the retina with arterial attenuation , and a normal band of the retinal area in the macular region. Optical coherence tomography revealed increased thickness of the inner retina. Optical coherence tomography angiography ( OCT-A) revealed a decreased flow signal in the superficial layers , with reduced flow signal in the choriocapillaris. OCT-A is a valuable alternative during the follow-up period in patients with central retinal artery occlusion , particularly in those with an allergy to contrast agents. The use of this as a non-invasive examination can improve the prognosis of patients and future studies investigating the treatment of central retinal artery occlusion.
