 The emergence of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumonia<disease> ( KPC-Kp) has become a significant problem in terms of public health and clinical outcome in many hospitals in Southern Europe. Treatment options are usually limited and effective treatment of infections caused by these pathogens is a considerable challenge for clinicians. Ceftazidime-avibactam has been recently approved for the treatment of difficult-to-treat infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in patients with limited treatment options. We reported the first case of KPC-Kp septic thrombophlebitis and right atrial endocarditis<disease> associated with metastatic lung abscesses<symptom> successfully treated with a prolonged ceftazidime/avibactam plus ertapenem treatment course , suggesting that this combination therapy could be safe and effective for serious Gram-negative infections. Interestingly , we also observed an apparent discrepancy between clinical and microbiological courses: the patient became rapidly afebrile; hemodynamically stable and his procalcitonin levels showed a prompt decreasing trend. Nevertheless , blood cultures remained persistently positive for a prolonged period. In conclusion , ceftazidime-avibactam plus ertapenem was a safe and effective therapy of serious endovascular infection due to KPC-Kp. Moreover , in this setting , follow-up blood cultures might represent an irreplaceable tool to guide the therapy.
