 Forensic odontology ( FO) is regarded in the literature as one of the most reliable and economical scientific methods for victim identification in mass disasters ( MDs). The present paper systematically reviews the role of forensic odontologists in various global MDs. A comprehensive search of the literature databases ( PubMed , Medline , SCOPUS , Web of Science and Google Scholar) , along with cross-referencing published peer-reviewed articles , was conducted. The search included full texts , abstracts or titles , had no inclusion year limit ( searched until September 2017) and was limited to the English language. Keywords included a combination of ` Forensic odontology ' , ` Dental records ' , ` Victim identification ' , ` Natural mass disaster ' , ` Criminal mass disaster ' , ` Accidental mass disaster ' and ` Victim disaster '. Of the included disasters ( 20) , 12 ( 57.14 %) were accidental , 5 ( 23.80 %) natural and 3 ( 19.04 %) were criminal. The maximum number of victims was associated with the Japan tsunami ( 15892) , followed by the Thailand tsunami ( 4280) and the Estonia ferry disaster ( 852). A total of 23654 victims were reported , of which 20569 ( 86.96 %) were positively identified. Reports from 17 MDs included the use of FO in victim identification ( 3025 ( 14.70 %) cases). In addition , 1094 victims ( 5.31 %; from 7 papers) were identified using FO in combination with other methodologies. The highest percentage of victims was identified using FO following the Kentucky air crash ( 47; 100 %) , followed by the Newark air crash ( 38; 76 %) , the Nepal air crash ( 10; 71.42 %) , the France air crash ( 56; 65.88 %) , the Australian bushfire ( 14; 63.63 %) , and the Estonia ferry disaster ( 57; 60.63 %). FO has played a significant role in victim identification in several MDs around the world. The success of FO-based identification is heavily dependent on the availability of ante-mortem records from general dental practitioners. Hence , adequate knowledge about FO and appropriate dental record keeping among general dental practitioners are critical.
