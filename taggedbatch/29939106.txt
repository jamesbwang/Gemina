 This article outlines the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders in individuals with traumatic brain injury ( TBI) , with a focus on DSM axis I disorders diagnosed on the basis of structured clinical interview. The epidemiology of psychiatric disorders in the general population is described as a basis for understanding the disorders that occur before and after TBI. For each disorder category , including mood disorders , anxiety<symptom> disorders , acute stress disorder , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) , substance use disorders , psychotic disorders , eating disorders , somatoform disorders , and adjustment disorders , the evidence from retrospective , cross-sectional and prospective studies is reviewed , showing the frequency , time course , and predictors of the disorders. Studies show elevated rates of depressive and anxiety<symptom> disorders after TBI , most commonly major depressive disorder and PTSD , usually emerging in the first year postinjury but with delayed onset in severe injury cases. Although individuals with a preinjury history are more likely to develop these disorders , the nature of the disorders may change after injury , and novel psychiatric disorders are also common. Even though the frequency of anxiety<symptom> disorders diminishes over the years postinjury , depressive disorders are more persistent during postinjury years. Substance use-while high before injury-declines after injury. The frequency of psychotic , eating , somatoform , and adjustment disorders do not exceed population rates.
