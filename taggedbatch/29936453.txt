 N. sativa essential oil ( EO) and its compounds ( thymoquinone , carvacrol and p-cymene) have a broad antimicrobial spectrum. The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial and resistance modifying activity of N. sativa EO , thymoquinone , carvacrol and p-cymene against Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen>. N. sativa EO , thymoquinone , carvacrol and p-cymene was assessed for its antimicrobial activity , modulation of antimicrobial resistance , inhibition of antimicrobial efflux and membrane integrity by broth microdilution , ethidium bromide accumulation and LIVE/DEAD BacLight â„¢ assays. L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> showed substantial susceptibility toward N. sativa EO , thymoquinone , and carvacrol. A significant reduction in MIC 's of EtBr and ciprofloxacin was noticed when tested in combination with N. sativa EO , thymoquinone , carvacrol and reserpine. In the presence of each compound the membrane integrity was disintegrated , and the EtBr accumulation increased which was comparable to positive control reserpine. N. sativa EO might have a potential for controlling the antibiotic resistance in Listeria.
