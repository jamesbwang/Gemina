 Tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> ( TB) is a leading cause of childhood mortality. Isoniazid preventive therapy significantly reduces progression to TB disease. The World Health Organization recommends that high TB burden countries conduct child contact management ( CCM) to identify exposed child contacts aged < 5 years for screening and appropriate treatment. An active , clinic-based CCM strategy incorporating transport/screening reimbursement , monitoring and evaluation tools , and health care worker education was implemented in western Kenya. Among 169 identified child contacts aged < 5 years , 146 ( 86 %) underwent successful screening , of whom 43 ( 29 %) were diagnosed with active TB. We describe our CCM strategy and its potential for enhancing screening and treatment efforts.
