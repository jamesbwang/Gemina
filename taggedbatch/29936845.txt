 Several aspects of pyrene fluorescence were applied to gain an insight into the nature of the microdomains in hydrophobically modified starch nanoparticles ( HM-SNPs) , prepared by reacting SNPs with propionic and hexanoic anhydride to yield C3- and C6-SNPs , respectively. The fluorescence experiments took advantage of the inherent hydrophobicity of pyrene to bind onto the hydrophobic domains generated by the HM-SNPs , and its specific response to the polarity of its environment , to probe its accessibility to quenchers such as oxygen or nitromethane dissolved in water. The equilibrium constant K
