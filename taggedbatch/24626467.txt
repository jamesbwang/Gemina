 Iron is an absolute requirement for both the host and most pathogens alike and is needed for normal cellular growth. The acquisition of iron by biological systems is regulated to circumvent toxicity of iron overload , as well as the growth deficits imposed by iron deficiency. In addition , hosts , such as humans , need to limit the availability of iron to pathogens. However , opportunistic pathogens such as
