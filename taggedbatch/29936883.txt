 Parkinson 's disease ( PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder. It is caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and the dopamine ( DA) deletion in the substantia nigra pars compacta ( SNpc). Morphine elevates the level of dopamine in the mesolimbic dopamine system and plays a role in alleviating PD symptoms. However , the molecular mechanism is still unclear. In present study , we found that morphine increased the cell viability in PC12 cells. 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ( MPP
