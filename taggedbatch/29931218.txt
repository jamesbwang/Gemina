 Massively parallel capture of short tandem repeats ( STRs , or microsatellites) provides a strategy for population genomic and demographic analyses at high resolution with or without a reference genome. However , the high Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR) cycle numbers needed for target capture experiments create genotyping noise through polymerase slippage known as PCR stutter. We developed SONiCS-Stutter mONte Carlo Simulation-a solution for stutter correction based on dense forward simulations of PCR and capture experimental conditions. To test SONiCS , we genotyped a 2499-marker STR panel in 22 humpback dolphins ( Sousa sahulensis) using target capture , and generated capillary-based genotypes to validate 5 of these markers. In these 110 comparisons , SONiCS showed a 99.1 % accuracy rate and a 98.2 % genotyping success rate , miscalling a single allele in a marker with low sequence coverage and rejecting another as un-callable. Source code and documentation for SONiCS is freely available at https://github.com/kzkedzierska/sonics. Raw read data used in experimental validation of SONiCS have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive under accession number SRP135756. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
