 The intestinal microbiota has increasingly been considered to play a role in the etiology of late-onset sepsis<disease> ( LOS). We hypothesize that early alterations in fecal volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) , reflecting intestinal microbiota composition and function , allow for discrimination between infants developing LOS and controls in a preclinical stage. In 9 neonatal intensive care units in the Netherlands and Belgium , fecal samples of preterm infants born at a gestational age ≤ 30 weeks were collected daily , up to the postnatal age of 28 days. Fecal VOC were measured by high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry ( FAIMS). VOC profiles of LOS infants , up to 3 days prior to clinical LOS onset , were compared with profiles from matched controls. In total , 843 preterm born infants ( gestational age ≤ 30 weeks) were included. From 127 LOS cases and 127 matched controls , fecal samples were analyzed by means of FAIMS. Fecal VOCs allowed for preclinical discrimination between LOS and control infants. Focusing on individual pathogens , fecal VOCs differed significantly between LOS cases and controls at all predefined time points. Highest accuracy rates were obtained for sepsis<disease> caused by Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , followed by sepsis<disease> caused by Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and Staphylococcus<pathogen> epidermidis<pathogen>. Fecal VOC analysis allowed for preclinical discrimination between infants developing LOS and matched controls. Early detection of LOS may provide clinicians a window of opportunity for timely initiation of individualized therapeutic strategies aimed at prevention of sepsis<disease> , possibly improving LOS-related morbidity and mortality.
