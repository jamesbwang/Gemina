 Proper development of the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC) , crucial for correct cognitive functioning , requires projections from , among others , the serotonergic ( 5-HT) and catecholaminergic systems , but it is unclear how these systems influence each other during development. Here , we describe the parallel development of the 5-HT and catecholaminergic prefrontal projection systems in rat and demonstrate a close engagement of both systems in the proximity of Cajal-Retzius cells. We further show that in the absence of the 5-HT transporter ( 5-HTT) , not only the developing 5-HT but also the catecholaminergic system , including their projections towards the mPFC , are affected. In addition , the layer identity of the mPFC neurons and reelin-positive interneuron number and integration are altered in the absence of the 5-HTT. Together , our data demonstrate a functional interplay between the developing mPFC 5-HT and catecholaminergic systems , and call for a holistic approach in studying neurotransmitter systems-specific developmental consequences for adult behavior , to eventually allow the design of better treatment strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders.
