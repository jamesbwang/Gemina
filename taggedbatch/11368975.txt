 The lateral hypothalamus is comprised of a heterogeneous mix of neurons that serve to integrate and regulate sleep , feeding , stress , energy balance<symptom> , reward , and motivated behavior. Within these populations , the hypocretin/orexin neurons are among the most well studied. Here , we provide an overview on how these neurons act as a central hub integrating sensory and physiological information to tune arousal and motivated behavior accordingly. We give special attention to their role in sleep-wake states and conditions of hyper-arousal , as is the case with stress-induced anxiety<symptom>. We further discuss their roles in feeding , drug-seeking , and sexual behavior , which are all dependent on the motivational state of the animal. We further emphasize the application of powerful techniques , such as optogenetics , chemogenetics , and fiber photometry , to delineate the role these neurons play in lateral hypothalamic functions.
