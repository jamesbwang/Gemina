 Klinefelter syndrome<disease><symptom> ( KS) is a common genetic condition in which males have an extra X chromosome. KS is associated with testosterone deficiency , neurodevelopmental delays , and cardiometabolic disorders. There has been recent interest in prepubertal androgen treatment , however the effects on puberty and gonadal function are unknown. To compare onset of puberty and testicular function in pre-pubertal boys treated with two years of oxandrolone versus placebo. Double-blind randomized controlled trial. Single tertiary care referral center. 80 prepubertal boys with KS , mean age 8.0 ± 2.2 years ( range 4-12). Oxandrolone 0.05 mg/kg ( Ox) versus identical-appearing placebo capsule ( Pl) given for two years. Onset of gonadarche ( testicular volume ≥ 4 mL) and onset of pubarche ( Tanner 2 pubic hair); change in testicular hormone concentrations. Ox-treated group had 20.5 times higher odds of reaching gonadarche ( OR 95 % CI 6.5 , 77.8) and 28.1 times higher odds of reaching pubarche ( OR 95 % CI 8.8 , 110.4) during the two-year study period after adjusting for baseline age. Gonadarche and pubarche both occurred at a younger age in the Ox group ( gonadarche 9.8 ± 1.5 versus 12.1 ± 1.0 years , p < 0.001; pubarche 10.2 ± 1.1 versus 11.6 ± 1.3 years , p = 0.02). Serum concentrations of testicular hormones ( testosterone , inhibin B and anti-mullerian hormone) and gonadotropins ( luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone) were not different between groups. Two years of oxandrolone treatment in pre-pubertal boys with KS results in an increased risk of early gonadarche , on average two years earlier than in placebo-treated boys. Oxandrolone did not affect serum concentrations of testicular hormones.
