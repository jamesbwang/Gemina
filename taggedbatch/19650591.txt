 None Thirteen discs of each material ( nanohybrid resin composite , microhybrid resin composite , and amalgam) were prepared , polished , and sterilized in a gamma radiation chamber. The saliva-free specimens were exposed to the The means and standard deviations of the logarithmic values of the colonies on the surfaces of amalgam , microhybrid , and nanohybrid resin composites were equal to 3.76 ± 0.64 , 3.91 ± 0.52 and 3.34 ± 0.74 , respectively. There were no significant differences between the restorative materials in terms of
