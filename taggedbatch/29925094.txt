 A wearable cardioverter-defibrillator ( WCD) can terminate ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardias<symptom> via electrical shock<symptom> and thus give transient protection from sudden cardiac death. We investigated its role after cardiac surgery. We retrospectively analyzed all patients who were discharged with a WCD from cardiac surgery department. The WCD was prescribed for patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) of â‰¤ 35 % or an explanted implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD). A total of 100 patients were included in this study , the majority ( Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 13 % of the investigated patients. LVEF improved significantly after 3 months , and thus a permanent ICD implantation was avoided in several cases. Sternotomy did not impair wearing time of the WCD. A WCD can effectively protect patients against ventricular tachyarrhythmias after cardiac surgery.
