 To assess vaccination coverage and timeliness among Indigenous and non-Indigenous children in New South Wales and the rest of Australia , with a particular focus on changes in the vaccination coverage gaps after the introduction of the Aboriginal Immunisation Healthcare Worker ( AIHCW) Program in NSW in 2012. Cross-sectional analysis of Australian Immunisation Register data ( 2008-2016). Annual estimates of full vaccination coverage at 9 , 15 and 51 months of age for Indigenous and non-Indigenous children in NSW and the rest of Australia; differences in coverage between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children at each milestone. The proportion of Indigenous and non-Indigenous children classified as fully vaccinated at 9 , 15 , and 51 months increased significantly in both NSW and the rest of Australia after the introduction of the AIHCW Program. The mean annual difference in full vaccination coverage between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children in NSW aged 9 months declined from 6.6 ( 95 % CI , 5.2-8.0) during 2008-2011 to 3.7 percentage points ( 95 % CI , 2.5-4.8) during 2012-2016; for those aged 15 months it declined from 4.6 ( 95 % CI , 3.1-6.0) to 2.2 percentage points ( 95 % CI , 1.0-3.4) , and for those aged 51 months it declined from 8.5 ( 95 % CI , 7.2-9.8) to 0.6 percentage points ( 95 % CI , -0.6 to 1.8). Reductions in the differences in coverage were not as marked in the rest of Australia. In 2016 , there was no statistically significant difference in coverage at any of the three milestones in NSW: at 9 months the difference was 1.6 percentage points ( 95 % CI , -1.0 to 4.1); at 15 months , 0.4 percentage points ( 95 % CI , -2.2 to 2.9); and at 51 months , -1.8 percentage points ( 95 % CI , -4.4 to 0.8). Our findings suggest that a dedicated program can help overcome barriers to timely vaccination and significantly improve timely vaccination rates in Indigenous Australian children.
