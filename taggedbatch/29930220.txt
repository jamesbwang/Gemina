 Charles Bonnet syndrome<disease><symptom> ( CBS) refers to visual hallucinations that occur in individuals with preserved cognitive functions associated with visual impairment. This article reviews occurence of visual hallucinations in subjects with CBS by journals published in English in the Pubmed database in the period 1992-2018. Criteria for selection of appropriate papers were sufficient information and perspicuous view on pathogenesis , epidemiology , clinical presentation and treatment possibilities of CBS. Most commonly , visual hallucinations in patients with CBS are complex , repetitive and stereotyped. Such individuals have preserved insight that those percepts are not real , and there is an absence of secondary explanatory delusions and hallucinations within other modalities. Seeing as the aforementioned percepts do not share all the characteristics of hallucinations , it remains unresolved how they should be referred to. Terms as release hallucinations , one that is reflecting its underlying pathogenesis , or confabulatory hallucinatory experiences have been proposed. Moreover , CBS has also been referred to as phantom vision syndrome<disease><symptom> and may occur in any ophthalmological disease. It is not particularly connected with loss of function along any level of the visual pathway. Although this syndrome<disease><symptom> is mostly associated with age-related macular degeneration , glaucoma and cataract , it could be related to almost any other ophthalmological conditions. The incidence of CBS alongside with mostly other ocular pathology is rising as population is ageing. Nonetheless , CBS remains commonly underreported , under recognized and/or misrecognized. Albeit the treatment recommendations and guidelines are not yet fully established , it is important to raise awareness of this specific and distinct condition , which inevitably implicates many differential diagnostic deliberations.
