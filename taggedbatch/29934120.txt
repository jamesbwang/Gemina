 This short communication analyzed enzymolysis kinetics and estimated the resource conversion efficiency of corn cobs. Three pretreatments were applied , and enzymatic hydrolysis was performed to obtain solid residues. The enzymolysis process was fit to a modified logistic formula. The kinetics of enzymolysis were similar for all pretreatments , and all kinetics fit the modified logistic formula. Resource conversion efficiency and saccharification efficiency were estimated for the following pretreatments: 69 % and 86 % for acid steam explosion , 59 % and 73 % for alkali soaking , 41 % and 51 % for water steam explosion , respectively. It can be concluded that pretreatment has a minor effect on the enzymolysis process of corn cobs and a greater effect on saccharification efficiency or resource conversion efficiency.
