 To determine whether screening for trisomy 21 based on first-trimester combined screening ( FTCS) with assessment of nasal bone ( NB) , tricuspid flow ( TCF) , and ductus venosus flow ( DVF) results in similar false-positive rates compared to ultrasound and cell-free DNA ( cfDNA) screening. This is a subanalysis of a prospective randomized controlled trial which was performed between October 2015 and December 2016. Pregnant women with a normal first-trimester ultrasound examination at 11 to 13 weeks ' gestation were randomized into two groups: ( 1) FTCS with assessment of the NB , TCF , and DVF ( extended FTCS ( eFTCS)) , and ( 2) ultrasound + cfDNA screening. The false-positive rate in screening for trisomy 21 was defined as the primary outcome parameter. The study population consisted of 688 women in each study arm. In the eFTCS group , the median delta fetal nuchal translucency thickness ( NT) was 0.0 mm , free beta-hCG and PAPP-A were 0.96 and 1.11 MoM , and NB , TCF , and DVF PIV were abnormal in 0.9 , 0.6 , and 7.0 % cases. In the ultrasound + cfDNA group , the median delta NT was 0.0 mm. In 10 pregnancies the cfDNA analysis was uninformative and the risk of trisomy 21 was based on eFTCS. There were no false-positive cases in the ultrasound + cfDNA group , whereas the false-positive rates were between 0.9 and 2.2 % with eFTCS. Screening for trisomy 21 based on ultrasound + cfDNA has a lower false-positive rate than screening based on eFTCS.
