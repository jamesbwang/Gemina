 Cellulolytic bacteria from cattle rumen with ability to hydrolyze cellulose rich biomass were explored. The study selected Paenibacillus<pathogen> polymyxa<pathogen> ND24 from 847 isolates as the most potent strain , which can efficiently produce cellulase by utilizing sugarcane bagasse , rice straw , corn starch , CMC , and avicel as a sole carbon source. On annotation of P.<pathogen> polymyxa<pathogen> ND24 genome , 116 members of glycoside hydrolase ( GH) family from CAZy clusters were identified and the presence of 10 potential cellulases was validated using protein folding information. Cellulase production was further demonstrated at lab-scale 5-L bioreactor exhibiting maximum endoglucanase activity up to 0.72 U/mL when cultivated in the medium containing bagasse ( 2 % w/v) after 72 h. The bagasse hydrolysate so produced was further utilized for efficient biogas production. The presence of diverse hydrolytic enzymes and formidable cellulase activity supports the use of P.<pathogen> polymyxa<pathogen> ND24 for cost-effective bioprocessing of cellulosic biomass.
