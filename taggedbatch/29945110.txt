 Thioxanthone and its derivatives are the most remarkable molecules due to their vast variety of application such as radiation curing that is , until using them as a therapeutic drug. Therefore , in this study it was intended to use 2-Thioxanthone acetic acid with and without NaCl in Tris HCl buffer solution ( pH: 7.0) to represent the interaction with ct-DNA. The UV-vis absorption spectra of TXCH
