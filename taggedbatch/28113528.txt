 With the development of electronic information technology , electronic medical records ( EMRs) have been a common way to store the patients ' data in hospitals. They are stored in different hospitals ' databases , even for the same patient. Therefore , it is difficult to construct a summarized EMR for one patient from multiple hospital databases due to the security and privacy concerns. Meanwhile , current EMRs systems lack a standard data management and sharing policy , making it difficult for pharmaceutical scientists to develop precise medicines based on data obtained under different policies. To solve the above problems , we proposed a blockchain-based information management system , MedBlock , to handle patients ' information. In this scheme , the distributed ledger of MedBlock allows the efficient EMRs access and EMRs retrieval. The improved consensus mechanism achieves consensus of EMRs without large energy consumption and network congestion<symptom>. In addition , MedBlock also exhibits high information security combining the customized access control protocols and symmetric cryptography. MedBlock can play an important role in the sensitive medical information sharing.
