 The aim of this study was to identify the main contributors to the health-related quality of life ( HRQoL) in multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism ( MSA-P) and to determine the usefulness of SF-36 in capturing the HRQoL changes over 1-year follow-up. A total of 45 MSA-P and 150 Parkinson 's disease ( PD) patients were studied. The hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of the SF-36 total score. The magnitude of any change for the HRQoL over 1-year of follow-up , was calculated as an effect size. The average scores for each SF-36 domains , except for the bodily pain , were lower in MSA-P than in PD patients ( p < 0.05). The most important predictors of HRQoL in MSA-P , were female gender , older age at onset , SCOPA-AUT score and UMSARS IV , which together with other selected clinical variables accounted for 84 % of the variance in the total SF-36 score in the final model in hierarchical analyses. During the 1-year follow-up , the SF 36 was found capable of detecting changes in MSA-P. Our study provided some new insights into potential predictors of the HRQoL and its longitudinal changes in MSA-P , which should be considered when healthcare programs are developed.
