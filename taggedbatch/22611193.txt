 Oxidative stress is related to ageing and degenerative diseases , including cancer. However , a moderate amount of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) is required for the regulation of cellular signalling and gene expression. A low level of ROS is important for maintaining quiescence and the differentiation potential of haematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs) , whereas the level of ROS increases during haematopoietic differentiation; thus , suggesting the importance of redox signalling in haematopoiesis. Here , we will analyse the importance of ROS for haematopoiesis and include evidence showing that cells from leukaemia patients live under oxidative stress. The potential sources of ROS will be described. Finally , the level of oxidative stress in leukaemic cells can also be harnessed for therapeutic purposes. In this regard , the reliance of front-line anti-leukaemia chemotherapeutics on increased levels of ROS for their mechanism of action , as well as the active search for novel compounds that modulate the redox state of leukaemic cells , will be analysed.
