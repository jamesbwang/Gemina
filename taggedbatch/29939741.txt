 Two new furanone-containing polyketides , linfuranones B and C , were isolated from a plant-associated actinomycete of the genus Sphaerimonospora. Their structures were determined by NMR and MS spectroscopic analyses , and the absolute configurations were established by anisotropic methods and chemical degradation approaches. In silico analysis of biosynthetic genes suggested that linfuranone B is generated from linfuranone C by oxidative cleavage of the polyketide chain. Linfuranones B and C induced preadipocyte differentiation into matured adipocytes at 20-40 Î¼M without showing cytotoxicity.
