 In recent years , organo-halide perovskite solar cells have garnered a surge of interest due to their high performance and low-cost fabrication processing. Owing to the multilayer architecture of perovskite solar cells , interface not only has a pivotal role to play in performance , but also influences long-term stability. Here we have employed diverse morphologies of electron selective layer ( ESL) to elucidate charge extraction behavior in perovskite solar cells. The TiO ₂ mesoporous structure ( three-dimensional) having varied thickness , and nanocolumns ( 1-dimensional) with tunable length were employed. We found that a TiO ₂ electron selective layer with thickness of about c.a. 100 nm , irrespective of its microstructure , was optimal for efficient charge extraction. Furthermore , by employing impedance spectroscopy at different excitation wavelengths , we studied the nature of recombination and its dependence on the charge generation profile , and results showed that , irrespective of the wavelength region , the fresh devices do not possess any preferential recombination site , and recombination process is governed by the bulk of the perovskite layer. Moreover , depending on the type of ESL , a different recombination mechanism was observed that influences the final behavior of the devices.
