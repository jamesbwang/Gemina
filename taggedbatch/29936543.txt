 A novel gene ( ANK58566) encoding a cold-active α-amylase was cloned from marine bacterium<pathogen> Bacillus<pathogen> sp. dsh19-1 ( CCTCC AB 2015426) , and the protein was expressed in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. The gene had a length of 1302 bp and encoded an α-amylase of 433 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 50.1 kDa. The recombinant α-amylase ( AmyD-1) showed maximum activity at 20 °C and pH 6.0 , and retained about 35.7 % of activity at 4 °C. The AmyD-1 activity was stimulated by Ca
