 The combination of oxaliplatin , leucovorin and fluorouracil ( FOLFOX) has been established as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer. However , the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant FOLFOX in patients with rectal cancer are still controversial. This prospective pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of neoadjuvant FOLFOX therapy without radiation for baseline resectable rectal cancer ( RC). The study included 30 patients with clinical stage II/III RC between February 2012 and December 2015. The patients were treated with six cycles of FOLFOX followed by elective surgery. The primary endpoint was the R0 resection rate. The secondary endpoints were the scheduled treatment completion rate , adverse events , pathological response and the disease-free survival ( DFS) rate. All the patients underwent elective R0 resection after neoadjuvant FOLFOX therapy. The completion rate of the 6-cycle regimen was 93.3 % ( 28/30 patients). Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in seven patients ( 23.3 %). Pathological complete response was noted in two patients ( 6.7 %). The 3-year DFS rate was 77.5 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 61.4 % -93.7 %). Neoadjuvant FOLFOX therapy without radiation is a feasible therapeutic strategy for baseline resectable RC.
