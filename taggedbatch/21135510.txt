 A growing amount of evidence suggests that thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH) is associated with cardiometabolic risk. However , there have been few longitudinal studies. The aim of this study was to explore the causal relationship between TSH and metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> ( MetS) in a large population-based longitudinal study. From 2010 to 2016 at the Health Management Center at Tri-Service General Hospital , 25,121 eligible patients were enrolled in our cross-sectional analyses. Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the longitudinal association among hypertension ( HTN) , prediabetes ( pre-DM) , MetS , diabetes ( DM) and TSH levels ( N = 12,463). The average follow-up time was 7.2 years. In the cross-sectional analysis , the OR for MetS was 1.06 ( 95 % CI = 1.03-1.09; P < 0.05) , while the ORs for DM , pre-DM or HTN were not statistically significant ( all P > 0.05). After dividing TSH levels into four quartiles , the ORs for the presence of MetS determined by comparing the highest TSH quartile with the lowest TSH quartile were 1.37 ( 95 % CI = 1.18-1.60) , 1.42 ( 95 % CI = 1.20-1.67) , and 1.44 ( 95 % CI = 1.22-1.69) ( all , P < 0.05) in model 1 , model 2 and model 3 respectively. The HR for the incidence of MetS was 1.33 ( 95 % CI = 1.17-1.51; P < 0.05). Our study revealed that TSH levels had a strong association with incident MetS.
