 Heterogeneous reactions on the aerosol particle surface in the atmosphere play important roles in air pollution , climate change , and global biogeochemical cycles. However , the reported uptake coefficients of heterogeneous reactions usually have large variations and may not be relevant to real atmospheric conditions. One of the major reasons for this is the use of bulk samples in laboratory experiments , while particles in the atmosphere are suspended individually. A number of technologies have been developed recently to study heterogeneous reactions on the surfaces of individual particles. Precise measurements on the reactive surface area , volume , and morphology of individual particles are necessary for calculating the uptake coefficient , quantifying reactants and products , and understanding the reaction mechanism better. In this study , for the first time we used synchrotron radiation X-ray computed tomography ( XCT) and micro-Raman spectrometry to measure individual CaCO
