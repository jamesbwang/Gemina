 Assessment of severity of liver fibrosis<disease> is essential in the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD). Second Harmonic Generation ( SHG) microscopy is a novel optical tissue imaging system that provides automated quantification of fibrosis<disease> based on unique architectural features of collagen. This study aims to develop and validate a SHG-based index for automated staging of liver fibrosis<disease> in patients with NAFLD. SHG microscopy was performed on archived liver biopsy specimens from 83 patients with NAFLD. A unique algorithm was developed to identify specific SHG parameters that correlated with fibrosis<disease> stage. The accuracy of the algorithm was compared against clinical assessment by experienced liver histopathologists using the Brunt fibrosis<disease> staging and further validated using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Mean age of the study cohort was 51.8 ± 11.7 years , with 41 % males. A fibrosis<disease> index ( SHG B-index) was developed comprising 14 unique SHG-based collagen parameters that correlated with severity of NAFLD fibrosis<disease> in a continuous fashion. The SHG B-index had excellent correlation with Brunt fibrosis<disease> stage ( Spearman 's correlation 0.820 , p < 0.001). AUROCs for prediction of Brunt fibrosis<disease> stages 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 were 0.853 , 0.967 , 0.985 and 0.941 respectively. In the cross-validation analysis , the SHG B-index demonstrated high specificity for diagnosis of all grades of fibrosis<disease>. A SHG B-index score of > 1.76 had an overall diagnostic accuracy of 98.5 % for prediction of presence of bridging fibrosis<disease> ( Brunt stage ≥ 3) with sensitivity of 87.5 % , specificity 98.0 % , positive predictive value 96.6 % and negative predictive value 92.6 %. The SHG B-index is a unique SHG-based index that provides accurate automated assessment of fibrosis<disease> stage in NAFLD patients.
