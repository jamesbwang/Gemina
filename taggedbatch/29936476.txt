 The radial forearm flap ( RFF) and the anterolateral thigh flap ( ALT) are commonly used for the reconstruction of head and neck soft-tissue defects. The aim of the study was to investigate and compare the surgical outcomes , complications and systemic condition of the patient after reconstruction of extensive head and neck defects with ALT or RFF following cancer extirpation. Between August 2011 and November 2013 , a total of 36 patients affected by head and neck cancer ( 31 males and five females; mean age = 64.7 years , range = 40-86 years) underwent microsurgical reconstruction with 29 RFF and 10 ALT procedures. The surgical outcomes and complications among these two groups were retrospectively analyzed. The success rate was 97 % for the RFF group and 90 % for the ALT group , with one total flap loss in each group. Donor-site complications occurred in 6 % of the RFF group and in 7 % of the ALT group. Seven RFF-treated patients ( 24 %) and two treated with ALT ( 20 %) experienced systemic complications. Statistical analysis confirmed no significant difference between the two groups regarding the variables investigated ( p > 0.05). In our experience , ALT and RFF demonstrated analogous practicability and reliability for the reconstruction of head and neck soft-tissue defects , with similar local and systemic complications and donor-site morbidity rates.
