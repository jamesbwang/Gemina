 Pesticide use in agricultural areas requires the application of numerous chemicals to control target organisms , leaving non-target organisms at risk. The present study evaluates the hepatic metabolomic profile of one group of non-target organisms , amphibians , after exposure to a single pesticide and pesticide mixtures. Five common-use pesticide active ingredients were used in this study , three herbicides ( atrazine , metolachlor and 2,4-d) , one insecticide ( malathion) and one fungicide ( propiconazole). Juvenile green frogs ( Lithobates clamitans) were reared for 60-90days post-metamorphosis then exposed to a single pesticide or a combination of pesticides at the labeled application rate on soil. Amphibian livers were excised for metabolomic analysis and pesticides were quantified for whole body homogenates. Based on the current study , metabolomic profiling of livers support both individual and interactive effects where pesticide exposures altered biochemical processes , potentially indicating a different response between active ingredients in pesticide mixtures , among these non-target species. Amphibian metabolomic response is likely dependent on the pesticides present in each mixture and their ability to perturb biochemical networks , thereby confounding efforts with risk assessment.
