 Recent studies have shown that mitochondria play a crucial role in cellular energy production through the oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS) system. Complex I ( NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase) , the first and largest enzyme complex of the OXPHOS system , includes both nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded proteins. However , the patterns of natural selection and phylogenetic implications of complex I in birds still remain unclear. In this study , we combined transcriptomic and phylogenetic analyses to comprehensively determine the evolution of avian complex I. The transcriptomes of three Passerida species ( Leiothrix lutea , Spodiopsar sericeus , and Passer montanus) were obtained using the Illumina HiSeq ™ 2500 system. More than 192,000,000 clean reads were assembled in a total of 828,267 transcripts. Evolutionary selection analysis suggested that six genes of the core subunits in avian complex I may have undergone putative positive selection. Notably , we found that the mean dN/dS ( ω) ratio for mitochondrial genes of core subunits was significantly lower than that for nuclear genes of non-core subunits within complex I. The constructed maximum-parsimony , maximum-likelihood , and Bayesian inference phylogenetic trees were based on 44 complex I genes. We verified that the family Paridae ( represented by Parus major and Pseudopodoces humilis) was clustered with Musicicapoidea. Our results provide new insights into the evolution of avian mitochondrial complex I.
