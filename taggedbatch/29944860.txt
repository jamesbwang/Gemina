 While a rich literature has documented that the efficiency of learning and memory varies across circadian time , a close survey of that literature reveals extensive heterogeneity in the time of day ( TOD) when peak cognitive performance occurs. Moreover , most previous experiments in rodents have not focused on the question of discriminating which memory processes ( e.g. , working memory , memory acquisition , or retrieval) are modulated by the TOD. Here , we use assays of contextual fear conditioning and spontaneous alternation in WT ( C57Bl/6 J) mice to survey circadian modulation of hippocampal-dependent memory at multiple timescales- including working memory ( seconds to a few minutes) , intermediate-term memory ( a delay of thirty minutes) , and acquisition and retrieval of long-term memory ( a delay of two days). Further , in order to test the relative contributions of circadian timing mechanisms to the modulation of memory , a parallel set of studies were performed in mice lacking clock timing mechanisms. These transgenic mice lacked the essential circadian gene Bmal1 , either globally ( Bmal1 null) or locally ( floxed Bmal1 mice , which lack Bmal1 in excitatory forebrain neurons , e.g. cortical and hippocampal neurons). Here , we show that in WT mice , retrieval ( but not working memory , intermediate-term memory , or acquisition of long-term memory) is modulated by TOD. However , transgenic mouse models lacking Bmal1- both globally , and only in forebrain excitatory neurons- show deficits regardless of the memory process tested ( and lack circadian modulation of retrieval). These results provide new clarity regarding the impact of the TOD on hippocampal-dependent memory and support the key role of hippocampal and cortical circadian oscillations in circadian gating of cognition.
