 Case reports have suggested an increased risk of gynecomastia with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ( ie , statins). A recent meta-analysis also found that statins decrease circulating testosterone levels in men. We investigated whether statin use was associated with an increased risk of gynecomastia. Case-control study. A cohort of patients from a random sample of 9 053 240 US subjects from the PharMetrics Plus New cases of gynecomastia requiring at least two ICD-9 codes were identified from the cohort and matched to 10 controls by follow-up time and age using density-based sampling. Rate ratios ( RRs) for users of statins were computed using conditional logistic regression adjusting for alcoholic cirrhosis , hyperthyroidism , testicular cancer , Klinefelter syndrome<disease><symptom> , obesity , hypogonadism , hyperprolactinemia and use of spironolactone , ketoconazole , H Our cohort included 6147 cases of gynecomastia and 61 470 corresponding matched controls. The adjusted RR for current , recent and past statin use with respect to gynecomastia was 1.19 ( 1.04-1.36) , 1.38 ( 1.15-1.65) and 1.20 ( 1.03-1.40) , respectively. Statin use is associated with an increased risk of developing gynecomastia. Clinicians should be cognizant of this effect and educate patients accordingly.
