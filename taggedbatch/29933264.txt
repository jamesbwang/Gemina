 Burnout and stress in medical settings have been associated with despondent staff and decreased productivity. Although Program Coordinators ( PCs) play an integral role in residency training programs , there exist few , if any , interventions aimed at addressing their burnout. A longitudinal study design was used to evaluate data from residency/fellowship training PCs who participated in a wellness retreat held at a single institution in August 2016. Subjects completed anonymous , pre- and post-retreat questionnaires in addition to a 3-month follow-up questionnaire , which included questions used to assess aspects of job demand , resiliency , and well-being. The seven-item Physician Well-Being Index and a logistic regression model were used to assess well-being. Mean values and SDs were reported to examine changes in mental health scores and participants ' job satisfaction over the course of the intervention. Nineteen of the 45 ( 43 %) invited residency/fellowship training PCs completed data collection. Coordinators ranged in age from 25 to 64 years; all were female. Well-being , sleep , resiliency , and employee satisfaction scores improved over the assessment period. Well-being scores initially decreased by 0.37 at the postassessment , but increased at follow-up ( mean: 2.0; SD 1.7). Stress scores increased from baseline to post , but decreased from baseline to follow-up: 0.2 and -0.2 , respectively. Residency PCs experienced improvements in mental quality of life , resiliency , stress , and sleep scores on attending the wellness program. Attention to such findings may have important implications , as we address the burnout crisis in the medical education community.
