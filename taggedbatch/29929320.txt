 The aim of the present study is to analyze relationships between land uses and anthropogenic pressures , and nutrient loadings in the Po river basin , the largest hydrographic system in Italy , together with the changes they have undergone in the last half century. Four main points are addressed: 1) spatial distribution and time evolution of land uses and associated N and P budgets; 2) long-term trajectories of the reactive N and P loadings exported from the Po river; 3) relationships between budgets and loadings; 4) brief review of relationships between N and P loadings and eutrophication in the Northern Adriatic Sea. Net Anthropogenic N ( NANI) and P ( NAPI) inputs , and N and P surpluses in the cropland between 1960 and 2010 were calculated. The annual loadings of dissolved inorganic nitrogen ( DIN) and soluble reactive phosphorus ( SRP) exported by the river were calculated for the whole 1968-2016 period. N and P loadings increased from the 1960s to the 1980s , as NAPI and NANI and N and P surpluses increased. Thereafter SRP declined , while DIN remained steadily high , resulting in a notable increase of the N :P molar ratio from 47 to 100. In the same period , the Po river watershed underwent a trajectory from net autotrophy to net heterotrophy , which reflected its specialization toward livestock farming. This study also demonstrates that in a relatively short time , i.e. almost one decade , N and P sources were relocated within the watershed , due to discordant environmental policies and mismanagement on the local scale , with frequent episodes of heavy pollution. This poses key questions about the spatial scale on which problems have to be dealt with in order to harmonize policies , set sustainable management goals , restore river basins and , ultimately , protect the adjacent coastal seas from eutrophication.
