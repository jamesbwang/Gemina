 The purpose of this study was to identify the association between antipsychotics and mortality in Alzheimer 's disease patients. Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database , 735 newly diagnosed Alzheimer 's disease patients aged over 65 years and receiving antipsychotic treatments , and 735 age , sex , physical comorbidity , and entry year with propensity scores , matched control subjects were enrolled and followed for a 10-year period until the end of 2011. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for analysis. The mortality rate was 56 % in Alzheimer 's disease patients treated with antipsychotics , and 65 % in Alzheimer 's disease patients not treated with antipsychotics during an average of 5.2 years of follow-up. The use of antipsychotics , typical antipsychotics , and atypical antipsychotics was found to be associated with lower mortality ( adjusted hazard ratio = 0.66 , 95 % confidence interval 0.58-0.75; 0.69 , 0.60-0.79; 0.56 , 0.44-0.71 , respectively , all p < 0.001). In addition , Alzheimer 's disease patients with higher cumulative dose and longer duration of exposure to antipsychotics showed a significantly reduced risk of mortality. Other variables associated with higher risk of mortality included age ( adjusted hazard ratio = 1.08 , 95 % confidence interval 1.07-1.09 , p < 0.001) , male gender ( 1.27 , 1.11-1.45 , p < 0.001) , diabetes mellitus ( 1.30 , 1.10-1.54 , p < 0.01) , congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( 1.54 , 1.11-2.12 , p < 0.01) , and stroke ( 1.23 , 1.05-1.44 , p < 0.01). The use of antipsychotics was found to be associated with lower mortality in Alzheimer 's disease patients. Moreover , dose and duration response effects were also identified.
