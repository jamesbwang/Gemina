 This paper reviews the current epidemiological data on peripheral artery disease ( PAD) in Europe. Cardiovascular disease ( CVD) burden is presented and PAD prevalence is discussed , as compared to coronary ( CAD) and cerebrovascular ( CeVD) diseases , in European Union ( EU) countries and European continent countries. The article reviews PAD clinical manifestations , PAD diagnosis , risk factors for PAD incidence and progression , PAD prognosis and financial implications. CVD mortality is higher in women than in men and in European continent countries , as compared to EU countries. While CAD and CeVD have a lower prevalence in EU countries , as compared to the whole continent , PAD and other CVDs still have a higher prevalence in EU countries. PAD prevalence vary widely between countries , increases sharply with aging and has a relation with ethnicity. CVD comorbidities are high in PAD subjects and particularly high in those with critical limb ischemia. PAD prognosis is related to CAD and CeVD mortality , that are particularly high in critical limb ischemia. This review promotes the need for global awareness on PAD burden , stimulates PAD screening and emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of PAD and associated cardiovascular comorbidities.
