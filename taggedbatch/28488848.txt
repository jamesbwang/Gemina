 Structural DNA nanotechnology provides unique , well-controlled , versatile , and highly addressable motifs and templates for assembling materials at the nanoscale. These methods to build from the bottom-up using DNA as a construction material are based on programmable and fully predictable Watson-Crick base pairing. Researchers have adopted these techniques to an increasing extent for creating numerous DNA nanostructures for a variety of uses ranging from nanoelectronics to drug-delivery applications. Recently , an increasing effort has been put into attaching nanoparticles ( the size range of 1-20 nm) to the accurate DNA motifs and into creating metallic nanostructures ( typically 20-100 nm) using designer DNA nanoshapes as molds or stencils. By combining nanoparticles with the superior addressability of DNA-based scaffolds , it is possible to form well-ordered materials with intriguing and completely new optical , plasmonic , electronic , and magnetic properties. This focused review discusses the DNA structure-directed nanoparticle assemblies covering the wide range of different one- , two- , and three-dimensional systems.
