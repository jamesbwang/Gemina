 Metalloproteinases of the astacin family are drawing ever increasing attention as potential drug targets. However , knowledge regarding inhibitors thereof is limited in most cases. Crucial for the development of metalloprotease inhibitors is high selectivity , to avoid side effects brought about by inhibition of off-target proteases and interference with physiological pathways. In this study we aimed at the design of novel selective inhibitors for the astacin proteinase meprin α. Based on a recently identified tertiary amine scaffold , a series of compounds was synthesized and evaluated. The compounds exhibit reasonable inhibitory activity with high selectivity over other metalloproteases. The isoenzyme meprin β is only slightly inhibited. Hence , the present study revealed a novel class of selective meprin α inhibitors with improved selectivity over known compounds.
