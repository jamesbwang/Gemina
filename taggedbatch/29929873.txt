 Multivitamins are a popular supplement taken to promote physical and mental health. During periods of stress , they may have a protective role for health and wellbeing , although the current evidence of their efficacy is mixed. To determine whether multivitamin supplementation impacts psychological and inflammatory markers of women who are experiencing psychological distress. An 8-week randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess changes in both psychological state and pro-inflammatory markers of patients receiving multivitamins or placebo. The sample comprised women who reported elevated psychological distress in the previous 4 weeks. Psychological state was assessed using Spielberger 's State-Trait Personality Inventory to assess anxiety<symptom> , curiosity , depression<symptom> and anger. Pro-inflammatory markers comprised interleukin ( IL) -1 β , IL-5 , IL-6 , tumour necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α and TNF-β. Improvements across time were observed for all psychological measures and cytokines , except IL-5 , but were independent of the active intervention. Only TNF-β demonstrated a significant differential change between groups over the course of the intervention , in favour of multivitamin supplementation ( active group mean rank decreased from 11.1 to 7.1; placebo group mean rank decreased from 8.9 to 7.8). The results suggest that administration of multivitamins was not effective in improving psychological state. However , some evidence supported the positive impact of multivitamin supplementation on pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles of women currently experiencing stress.
