 Blue Cone Monochromacy ( BCM) is a rare congenital cone dysfunction disorder with X-linked recessive mode of inheritance. BCM is caused by mutations at the OPN1LW/MW cone opsin gene cluster including deletions of the locus control region ( LCR) and/or parts of the gene cluster. We aimed at investigating the clinical presentation , genetic cause and inheritance underlying a sporadic case of BCM. We report a 24-year-old male presenting with congenital photophobia<symptom> , nystagmus<symptom> and colour vision abnormalities. There was no history of retinal dystrophy in the family. Clinical diagnosis of BCM was supported by genetic investigations of the patient and his family members. Molecular genetic analysis of the OPN1LW/OPN1MW gene cluster revealed a novel deletion of about 73 kb in the patient encompassing the LCR. The deletion was absent in the X-chromosomes of both the mother and transmitting grandfather. The present report provides the clinical findings and the genetic basis underlying a sporadic BCM case which is caused by a de novo deletion within the OPN1LW/MW gene cluster originating from the mother 's germline due to Alu-repeat mediated recombination. This is the first report of a de novo deletion resulting in BCM , highlighting the importance to consider BCM and perform genetic testing for this condition in male patients with cone dysfunction also in the absence of a positive family history.
