 Hybrid nucleotide-lipids composed of a lipid covalently attached to purine and pyrimidine nucleobases exhibit supramolecular properties. The novel cytidine and guanosine derivatives are promising bioinspired materials , which can act as supramolecular gelators depending on both the nucleobase and the presence of salts. These supramolecular properties are of broad interest for biomedical applications.
