 Breakdown of the alveolo-capillary wall is pathognomonic for Acute Lung Injury ( ALI). Angiopoietins , vascular-specific growth factors , are linked to endothelial barrier dysfunction , and elevated Angiopoietin-2 ( ANG2) levels are associated with poor outcome of ALI patients. Specialized immune cells , referred to as ` TIE2-expressing monocytes and macrophages ' ( TEM) , were shown to specifically respond to ANG2 binding. However , their involvement in acute<symptom> inflammatory processes is so far completely undescribed. Thus , our aim was to assess the dynamics of TEMs in a murine model of ALI. Intratracheal instillation of LPS induced a robust pulmonary pro-inflammatory response with endothelial barrier dysfunction and significantly enhanced ANG2 expression. The percentage number of TEMs , assessed by FACS analysis , was more than trebled compared to controls , with TEM count in lungs reaching more than 40 % of all macrophages. Such distinct dynamic was absent in all other analyzed compartments ( alveolar space , spleen , blood). Incubation of the monocytic cell line THP-1 with LPS or TNF-Î± resulted in a dose-dependent , significant upregulation of TIE2 , suggesting that not recruitment from extra-pulmonary compartments but TIE2 upregulation in resident macrophages accounts for increased lung TEM frequencies. For the first time , our data provide evidence that the activity of TEMs changes at sites of acute<symptom> inflammation<symptom>.
