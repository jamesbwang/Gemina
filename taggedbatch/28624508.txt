 Cutaneous larva migrans ( CLM) is a common skin infestation in tropical countries. The classic presentation is a serpiginous , migratory track on the feet. Local and systemic reactions , as well as secondary bacterial infections , are rarely reported. The authors report two cases of CLM with a blister and pustular response on uncommon body locations. The patients were treated with anthelmintic therapy , and a topical corticosteroid was used to relieve their severe reactions. This report aims to describe an infrequent presentation of a common disease and review treatment plans.
