 Human society is engaged in an arms race against cancer , which pits one evolutionary process-human cultural evolution as we develop novel cancer therapies-against another evolutionary process-the ability of oncogenic selection operating among cancer cells to select for lineages that are resistant to our therapies. Cancer cells have a powerful ability to evolve resistance over the short term , leading to patient relapse following an initial period of apparent treatment efficacy. However , we are the beneficiaries of a fundamental asymmetry in our arms race against cancer: Whereas our cultural evolution is a long-term and continuous process , resistance evolution in cancer cells operates only over the short term and is discontinuous- all resistance adaptations are lost each time a cancer patient dies. Thus , our cultural adaptations are permanent , whereas cancer 's genetic adaptations are ephemeral. Consequently , over the long term , there is good reason to expect that we will emerge as the winners in our war against cancer.
