 This study aimed to see whether measuring serum glutamate in children with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) could provide a biological marker that could allow early intervention. Serum glutamate was measured in 30 patients aged 3-10 years presenting with ASD to the Abou El Reesh Hospitals , Cairo University , Egypt and 30 matched controls without ASD in 2015. The Vineland Social Maturity Scale was applied to assess social competence , self- help skills and adaptive behaviour in both groups. The severity of autism was measured with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale test. The patients ' group showed higher mean values of serum glutamate ( 5.888) than the control group ( 2.521) and the statistical difference was significant ( p = 0.00021). There was no significant difference ( p = 0.151) in the serum level of glutamate between patients receiving 1-2 mg of risperidone ( 6.519 ± 2.851) and those who were free from any medication for at least six weeks ( 5.157 ± 2.184). We found higher levels of serum glutamate in subjects with ASD and this might reflect altered glutamatergic neurotransmission which may aid early ASD detection. Further investigations are needed with a large number of participants to further clarify the possibility of using glutamate as a biomarker for ASD.
