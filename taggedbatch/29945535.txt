 Objectives The COU-AA-301 trial demonstrated that in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer using abiraterone post-docetaxel increased overall survival. This study aims to assess this conclusion in a real world context. Design Retrospective chart review of a provincial Pharmacy BDM Database ( a pharmacy dispensing software) and a provincial Electronic Chart ( ARIA). Dispensing data , information on the state of the disease before and after abiraterone use , and information regarding effects of abiraterone were gathered. Setting Cancer centers in Alberta , Canada. Patients Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC) patients on abiraterone outside of a clinical trial who have previously had docetaxel chemotherapy for CRPC between February 2012 and May 2014. Primary outcome Overall survival from the time of abiraterone initiation. Results Overall survival increase of 17 months was consistent with the survival increase of 14.8 months observed in the pivotal trial. Conclusion Abiraterone is a valuable therapy post-docetaxel for metastatic CRPC , as in a real world context it demonstrated an increase in overall survival that was consistent with the findings of the clinical trial despite including a patient population of older age and lower performance status.
