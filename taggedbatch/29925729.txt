 The current study evaluated the effects of autoclave polymerization both with and without glass fiber ( GF) reinforcement on the surface roughness and hardness of acrylic denture base material. Ninety disc specimens ( 30 × 2.5 mm) were prepared from Vertex resin and divided according to polymerization techniques into a water bath , short and long autoclave polymerization groups. Tested groups were divided into three subgroups according to the GF concentration ( 0 , 2.5 , and 5 wt %). Profilometer and Vickers hardness tests were performed to measure surface roughness and hardness. ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison tests analyzed the results , and p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Autoclave polymerization significantly decreased the surface roughness and increased the hardness of acrylic resin without GF reinforcement ( p < 0.05). However , 5 wt % GF addition significantly increased surface roughness and decreased hardness of the autoclave polymerized denture base resin ( p < 0.05). Surface properties of Polymethyl methacrylate ( PMMA) denture base material improved with autoclave polymerization and negatively affected with GFs addition.
