 IL-13 receptor alpha 1 ( IL-13Rα1) associates with IL-4Rα to form a functional IL-4Rα/ IL-13Rα1 heteroreceptor ( HR) through which both IL-4 and IL-13 signal. Recently , HR expression was associated with the development of M2 type macrophages which function as antigen presenting cells ( APCs). Herein , we show that a subset of thymic resident dendritic cells ( DCs) expressing high CD11b ( CD11b
