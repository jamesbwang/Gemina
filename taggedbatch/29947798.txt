 The ubiquitous RarA/Mgs1/WRNIP protein plays a crucial , but poorly understood role in genome maintenance. We show that Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> RarA , in the apo form , preferentially binds single-stranded ( ss) over double-stranded ( ds) DNA. SsbA bound to ssDNA<pathogen> loads RarA , and for such recruitment the amphipathic C-terminal domain of SsbA is required. RarA is a DNA-dependent ATPase strongly stimulated by ssDNA-dsDNA junctions and SsbA , or by dsDNA ends. RarA , which may interact with PriA , does not stimulate PriA DNA unwinding. In a reconstituted PriA-dependent DNA replication system , RarA inhibited initiation , but not chain elongation. The RarA effect was not observed in the absence of SsbA , or when the host-encoded preprimosome and the DNA helicase are replaced by proteins from the SPP1 phage with similar function. We propose that RarA assembles at blocked forks to maintain genome integrity. Through its interaction with SsbA and with a preprimosomal component , RarA might impede the assembly of the replicative helicase , to prevent that recombination intermediates contribute to pathological DNA replication restart.
