 Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> is a protozoan parasite which can be grown in vivo and in vitro. Various cell lines are used for T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> culture in vitro. In this study , four cell lines of HeLa , Vero , RBK and A549 were compared with each other for T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> tachyzoites culture. The four cell lines were cultured and infected with 5,000,000 tachyzoites , respectively. The number of tachyzoites and viable host cells and pH of the media were assessed in each culture. The highest tachyzoite yield was seen in HeLa cell culture. The lowest number of viable host cells and the lowest pH were seen in HeLa cell line culture. The lowest tachyzoite yield , the highest viable cell and the highest pH were observed in Vero cell line culture. HeLa and Vero cell lines are thus appropriate for rapid and long-term propagations of T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> tachyzoites , respectively.
