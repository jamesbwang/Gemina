 Retinitis pigmentosa ( RP) is a hereditary blinding disease characterized by neurodegeneration of photoreceptors. Retinal ganglion cells ( RGCs) in animal models of RP exhibit an abnormally high spontaneous activity that interferes with signal processing. Blocking AMPA/Kainate receptors by bath application of CNQX decreases the spontaneous firing , suggesting that inhibiting these receptors in vivo may help maintain the function of inner retinal neurons in rd10 mice experiencing photoreceptor degeneration. To test this , rd10 mice were i.p. injected with CNQX or GYKI 52466 ( an AMPA receptor antagonist) for 1-2 weeks , and examined for their retinal morphology ( by immunocytochemistry) , function ( by MEA recordings) and visual behaviors ( using a black/white box). Our data show that iGluRs were up-regulated in the inner plexiform layer ( IPL) of rd10 retinas. Application of CNQX at low doses both in vitro and in vivo , attenuated the abnormal<symptom> spontaneous spiking in RGCs , and increased the light-evoked response of ON RGCs , whereas GYKI 52466 had little effect. CNQX application also improved the behavioral performance. Interestingly , in vivo administration of CNQX delayed photoreceptor degeneration , evidenced by the increased cell number and restored structure. CNQX also improved the structure of bipolar cells. Together , we demonstrated that during photoreceptor degeneration , blockade of the non-NMDA iGluRs decelerates the progression of RGCs dysfunction , possibly by dual mechanisms including slowing photoreceptor degeneration and modulating signal processing within the IPL. Accordingly , this strategy may effectively extend the time window for treating RP.
