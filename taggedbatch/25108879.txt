 LCB01-0371 is a novel oxazolidinone antibiotic that blocks protein production by binding to bacterial 23S ribosomes. This antibiotic is active against Gram-positive bacteria. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics ( PKs) of LCB01-0371 and evaluate its safety profile. A randomized , open-label , two-way crossover study was performed in 18 healthy Korean male subjects. All subjects received a single oral 800 mg dose of LCB01-0371 in each period under fed or fasting condition with a 7-day washout in between. The fed condition was defined as consumption of a meal of 800-1,000 kcal containinƒù50 % of fat content. Serial blood samples were collected over 24 h after dosing , and the PK parameters were calculated by noncompartment analysis. All available data of the subjects who received LCB01-0371 at least once were included in the safety data summaries. In the fed condition , both the maximum plasma concentration ( Although the
