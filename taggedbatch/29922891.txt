 Primary adult glaucomas that have an occludable angle with peripheral anterior synechiae which are too few to account for the chronically raised IOP , or the glaucomatous optic neuropathy , do not fit the definition of either POAG or PACG and can be considered as combined mechanism glaucoma ( CMG). We aimed to compare the clinical features and anatomical parameters of combined mechanism glaucoma with age , sex , and refraction-matched POAG and chronic PACG eyes. Consecutive adult patients with definitive optic nerve head and perimetric changes of glaucoma were screened at a tertiary care center. All glaucomatous eyes having an IOP > 22 mmHg on at least three separate occasions and glaucomatous optic neuropathy consistent with moderate visual field loss in the eye were divided as POAG , PACG , and CMG. Eyes with occludable angles having < 90 ° of goniosynechiae were diagnosed as CMG. A detailed clinical examination , ocular biometry , and ASOCT were performed in the better eye of all individuals. A total of 93 patients with similar visual field index or pattern standard deviation on perimetry were evaluated: 32 POAG , 31 CMG , and 30 PACG. The mean anterior chamber depth was 3.47 ± 0.37 mm in POAG , 2.81 ± 0.32 mm in PACG , and 3.06 ± 0.26 mm in CMG ( p < 0.0001). Mean lens thickness was 4.22 ± 0.27 mm in POAG , 4.53 ± 0.35 mm in PACG , and 4.44 ± 0.29 mm in CMG ( p = 0.0004). Iridotrabecular contact on ASOCT was nil in POAG , a mean of 87.60 ± 12.802 % in PACG eyes , and 15.23 ± 14.19 % in CMG eyes , p < 0.0001. CMG was similar to PACG in terms of corneal diameters and lens thickness and had an axial length in between PACG and POAG. On ASOCT , all parameters had highest values in POAG eyes and the least in PACG eyes , with CMG eyes having values in between the other two groups , p value of < 0.0001 between each group for all parameters. This study has demonstrated significantly different anatomical parameters in eyes with CMG , in addition to the differences on gonioscopy and iridotrabecular contact , indicating that CMG is discernibly dissimilar to PACG and POAG.
