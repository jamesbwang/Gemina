 Pulp canal calcification is characterized by the deposition of calcified tissue along the canal walls. As a result , the root canal space can become partially or completely obliterated. Recently , `` guided endodontics '' has been reported as an alternative solution in cases of partial or completed canal obliteration. Although this technique can enhance minimally invasive access to the calcified canal , it has been shown that the incisal surfaces are often removed during the access of anterior teeth. This report describes 2 cases of guided endodontics using conventional palatal access in calcified anterior teeth and discusses the applicability of this approach in cases of pulp canal calcification with apical periodontitis<disease> and acute symptoms. The method demonstrated high reliability and permitted proper root canal disinfection expeditiously , without the unnecessary removal of enamel and dentin in the incisal surface.
