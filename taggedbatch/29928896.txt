 Bile acid ( BA) synthesis is regulated through suppression of hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase via FXR activation in hepatocytes and/or enterocytes; in enterocytes , this process requires FGF19 signaling. To study these pathways , we quantified markers of BA synthesis ( 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one; C4) and cholesterol production ( lathosterol) , FGF19 , and BAs in serum from healthy male volunteers given 1 oral dose of the nonsteroidal FXR agonist Px-102 ( 0.15 mg/kg , 0.3 mg/kg , 0.6 mg/kg , 1.12 mg/kg , 2.25 mg/kg , 3.38 mg/kg , or 4.5 mg/kg). After 8 hrs , serum levels of C4 decreased by 80 % in volunteers given 0.15 mg/kg , whereas serum levels of FGF19 were unchanged. Serum levels of FGF19 increased significantly , in a dose-dependent manner , in volunteers given > 0.3 mg/kg Px-102 , up to as much as 1600 % , whereas C4 levels remained significantly reduced ( by > 80 %). For all doses , FGF19 levels returned to normal 24 hrs after administration of Px-102. Serum levels of C4 decreased before levels of FGF19 levels increased , and were still reduced by 95 % 24 hrs after the highest dose ( 4.5 mg/kg) of Px-102 , even though levels of FGF19 had returned to baseline. Our findings indicate that activation of hepatic FXR is able to suppress BA synthesis , independent of FGF19.
