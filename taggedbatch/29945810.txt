 The aim of the article is to present a summary of current knowledge on tobacco smoking in France available through representative population surveys. Smoking is very common in France as more than a quarter ( 28.7 %) of 15-75years old individuals reported daily smoking in 2016. The rate is also high among 15-year-old ( 14.6 %) and half of them ( 51.8 %) have already smoked one cigarette. Since the 1970s , sex differences in smoking behaviour are narrowing. More recently , since 2000 , smoking prevalence has tended to decrease among the most advantaged individuals but to increase among less advantaged ones. These social inequalities , which are becoming more and more pronounced , are being observed from smoking initiation , often before the age of 18. Daily users of E-cigarettes represent 2.5 % of individuals from 15-75 years in France. They are also tobacco smokers ( 58.8 %) or former smokers ( 41.2 %). Taking social inequalities in health into consideration , notably regarding smoking initiation , is a key challenge in the fight against smoking. It is essential to strengthen efforts to decrease the rate of smoking in France. The 2017 Health Barometer and Escapad surveys will allow evaluation of the public policies implemented in 2016 and determine whether they have had an impact on the image of smoking and on smoking rates.
