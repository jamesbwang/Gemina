 Different factors , such as age , gender , preoperative weight but also the patient 's motivation , are known to impact outcomes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGBP). Weight<symptom> loss<symptom> prediction is helpful to define realistic expectations and maintain motivation during follow-up , but also to select good candidates for surgery and limit failures. Therefore , developing a realistic predictive tool appears interesting. A Swiss cohort ( n = 444) , who underwent RYGBP , was used , with multiple linear regression models , to predict weight<symptom> loss<symptom> up to 60 months after surgery considering age , height , gender and weight at baseline. We then applied our model on two French cohorts and compared predicted weight<symptom> to the one finally reached. Accuracy of our model was controlled using root mean square error ( RMSE). Mean weight<symptom> loss<symptom> was 43.6 ± 13.0 and 40.8 ± 15.4 kg at 12 and 60 months respectively. The model was reliable to predict weight<symptom> loss<symptom> ( 0.37 < R Our statistical model to predict weight<symptom> loss<symptom> outcomes after RYGBP seems accurate. It could be a valuable tool to define realistic weight<symptom> loss<symptom> expectations and to improve patient selection and outcomes during follow-up. Further research is needed to demonstrate the interest of this model in improving patients ' motivation and results and limit the failures.
