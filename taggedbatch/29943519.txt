 The macrocyclic antibiotic mangrolide A has been described to exhibit potent activity against a number of clinically important Gram-negative pathogens. Reported is the first enantioselective total synthesis of mangrolide A and derivatives. Salient features of this synthesis include a highly convergent macrocycle preparation , stereoselective synthesis of the disaccharide moiety , and two Î²-selective glycosylations. The synthesis of mangrolide A and its analogues enabled the re-examination of its activity against bacterial pathogens , and only minimal activity was observed.
