 The largest lake transgression event ( LTE) associated with lake anoxic events ( LAE) and periodic seawater incursion events ( SWIE) in the Songliao Basin , northeastern China , occurred during deposition of the Cretaceous Nenjiang Formation. The Yaojia-Nenjiang Formation boundary ( YNB) marks the beginning of the LTE , as well as LAE and SWIE. However , there is an absence of direct radioisotopic dating , and therefore the age of the YNB , as well as the beginning of LTE , together with their relationship with other geological events , is strongly debated. Here we present a new SIMS U-Pb zircon age from the lowermost Nenjiang Formation. The bentonite bed located 9.88 m above the YNB of the X1-4 borehole was analyzed. Twenty-five analyses of 25 zircons were conducted , which produced a weighted mean age of 85.5 Â± 0.6 Ma ( MSWD = 0.87). Based on the average sediment accumulation rate , the age of the YNB is suggested to be 85.7 Ma , indicating that the LTE began in the Early Santonian. The new ages provide a precise chronostratigraphic framework for climatic and geological events. Our new results imply that the beginning of the LTE , LAE and SWIE occurred almost simultaneously with short-term sea level rise , and probably had a close relationship with OAE3.
