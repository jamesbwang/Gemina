 Integral equations of uniform fluids have been considered unable to predict any characteristic feature of the fluid-solid phase transition , including the shoulder that arises in the second peak of the fluid-phase radial distribution function , RDF , of hard-core systems obtained by computer simulations , at fluid densities very close to the structural two-step phase transition. This reasoning is based on the results of traditional integral approximations , like Percus-Yevick , PY , which does not show such a shoulder in hard-core systems , neither in two nor three dimensions. In this work , we present results of three Ansätze , based on the PY theory , that were proposed to remedy the lack of PY analytical solutions in two dimensions. This comparative study shows that one of those Ansätze does develop a shoulder in the second peak of the RDF at densities very close to the phase transition , qualitatively describing this feature. Since the shoulder grows into a peak at still higher densities , this integral equation approach predicts the appearance of an orientational order characteristic of the hexatic phase in a continuous fluid-hexatic phase transition.
