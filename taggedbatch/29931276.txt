 A sliding window analysis over a protein or genomic sequence is commonly performed , and we present a Python tool , BioStructMap , that extends this concept to three-dimensional ( 3D) space , allowing the application of a 3D sliding window analysis over a protein structure. BioStructMap is easily extensible , allowing the user to apply custom functions to spatially aggregated data. BioStructMap also allows mapping of underlying genomic sequences to protein structures , allowing the user to perform genetic-based analysis over spatially linked codons-this has applications when selection pressures arise at the level of protein structure. The Python BioStructMap package is available at https://github.com/andrewguy/biostructmap and released under the MIT License. An online server implementing standard functionality is available at https://biostructmap.burnet.edu.au. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
