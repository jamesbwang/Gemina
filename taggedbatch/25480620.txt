 The role of intraoperative cholangiogram ( IOC) during cholecystectomy is debated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility , benefit and risk of performing systematic IOC in patients undergoing cholecystectomy for acute gallstone-related disease. Between July 2013 and January 2015 , all patients admitted for an acute gallstone-related condition and undergoing same-hospital-stay cholecystectomy were prospectively followed. IOC was systematically attempted and predictors of IOC failure were analyzed. Among the 581 enrolled patients , IOC was deliberately not performed in 3 cases. IOC was successful in 509/578 patients ( 88.1 %). The main predictors of IOC failure were age , body mass index , male gender and associated acute cholecystitis<disease>. Thirty-two patients with suspected common bile duct stone on IOC underwent 38 unnecessary negative postoperative common bile duct investigations ( 32/509 , 6.3 %). There was one IOC-related adverse outcome ( mild pancreatitis<disease> , 1/578 , 0.2 %). IOC can be successfully and safely performed in the majority of patients undergoing cholecystectomy for acute gallstone-related disease. Although its positive predictive value is suboptimal and results in a number of unnecessary postoperative common bile duct investigations , IOC accurately rules out common bile duct stones in patients with acute gallstone-related conditions.
