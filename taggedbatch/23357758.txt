 Asymmetrical postural behaviors are frequently observed after a stroke. They are due in part to the sensorimotor deficit , but they could also be related to a disorder of the representation of the body in space. The objective was to determine whether the asymmetrical postural behaviors of chronic stroke patients are related with a disruption of the perception of spatial frame. 30 chronic stroke patients ( mean age 60.3 year ± 10 , mean delay post-stroke 4.78 year ± 3) , 15 patients with right brain damage ( RBD) and 15 patients with left brain damage ( LBD) , and 20 healthy subjects participated in the study. Postural asymmetry was detected by the evaluation of body<symptom> weight repartition on a force platform ( weight<symptom> body asymmetry) and was related to the longitudinal body axis ( LBA) and the subjective straight ahead ( SSA) ( egocentric space representation) and to the subjective visual vertical ( SVV) ( allocentric space representation) by a multivariate analysis of variance adjusted with motor function and sensitivity as covariables. Both patients with RBD ( 35 % ± 8) and LBD ( 39 % ± 4) had body<symptom> weight asymmetry and there was still space misperception at this stage of recovery , especially in the RBD group. WBA was related to LBA when considering both patients with RBD and LBD ( p = 0.03). However , this relation was dependent on the side of the lesion<symptom> ( p = 0.0006) with a stronger relation in the RBD group ( 0.01). No relation with WBA was found neither with SSA ( p = 0.58) nor with SVV ( p = 0.47). This study pointed out a strong relationship between disturbance in the perception of the longitudinal body axis and postural asymmetry in chronic strokes , and especially within the RBD group. Conversely , no other spatial perturbations seemed to be involved in this particular postural behavior.
