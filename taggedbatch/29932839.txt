 The Inocybe geophylla group is circumscribed based on phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences largely sampled from North<pathogen> America and Europe. Twenty-nine phylogenetic species are uncovered after analysis of combined nuc 28S rDNA ( 28S) and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit ( rpb2) DNA sequence data. Species in the I. geophylla group share the presence of a cortina , silky-fibrillose pileus and stipe , pruinose stipe apex , spermatic odor , thick-walled hymenial cystidia , and smooth amygdaliform or elliptical basidiospores. Within the group , as many as five phylogenetic species attributable to I. lilacina and allies form a strongly supported clade based on analysis of nuc ITS1-5.8 S-ITS2 rDNA ( ITS ( internal transcribed spacer)) , 28S , and rpb2 data. However , all lilac-colored species do not form a monophyletic group. Sufficient morphological and ecological data are present to document four of the I. lilacina subgroup species , two of which are described from North<pathogen> America as new: I. ionocephala and I. sublilacina. Inocybe lilacina is recircumscribed based on sequencing the holotype and is distributed in the eastern United States under pines and/or hardwoods. Inocybe pallidicremea is a widespread and common conifer associate in mostly northern parts of North<pathogen> America , to which the name I. lilacina was previously applied. Descriptions , photographs , line drawings , and a taxonomic key to lilac species in the I. lilacina subgroup from North<pathogen> America are provided. Well-documented collections , especially notes on gross morphology and ecology , are needed to continue to assess and describe the high taxonomic variation in the I. lilacina subgroup and its allies worldwide.
