 Aberrant activation of toll-like receptor ( TLR) s results in persistent and prolonged neuroinflammation and has been implicated in the pathogenesis and exacerbation of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. TLR3 coordinates the innate immune response to viral<disease> infection<disease> and recent data have demonstrated that inhibiting fatty acid amide hydrolase ( FAAH) , the enzyme that primarily metabolizes anandamide , modulates TLR3-mediated neuroinflammation. However , the physiological and behavioural consequences of such modulation are unknown. The present study examined the effect of URB597 , a selective FAAH inhibitor , on neuroinflammation , physiological and behavioural alterations following administration of the TLR3 agonist and viral mimetic poly I: C to female rats. URB597 attenuated TLR3-mediated fever<symptom> , mechanical and cold allodynia , and anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze and open field arena. There was no effect of URB597 on TLR3-mediated decreases in body<symptom> weight and no effect in the sucrose preference or forced swim tests. URB597 attenuated the TLR3-mediated increase in the expression of CD11b and CD68 , markers of microglia/macrophage activation. In summary , these data demonstrate that enhancing FAAH substrate levels suppresses TLR3-mediated microglia/macrophage activation and associated changes in fever<symptom> , nociceptive responding and anxiety-related behaviour. These data provide further support for FAAH as a novel therapeutic target for neuroinflammatory disorders.
