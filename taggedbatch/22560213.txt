 The main goal of the study was to characterize the behavioral and metabolomic profiles of repeated administration ( for 11 days) of d-amphetamine ( AMPH , 3 mg/kg i. p.) , indirect agonist of dopamine ( DA) , in widely used 129S6/SvEvTac ( 129Sv) and C57BL/6NTac ( Bl6) mouse strains. Acute administration of AMPH ( acute AMPH) induced significantly stronger motor stimulation in Bl6. However , repeated administration of AMPH ( repeated AMPH) caused stronger motor sensitization in 129Sv compared acute AMPH. Body<symptom> weight of 129Sv was reduced after repeated saline and AMPH , whereas no change occurred in Bl6. In the metabolomic study , acute AMPH induced an elevation of isoleucine and leucine , branched chain amino acids ( BCAA) , whereas the level of hexoses was reduced in Bl6. Both BCAAs and hexoses remained on level of acute AMPH after repeated AMPH in Bl6. Three biogenic amines ( asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA) , alpha-aminoadipic acid ( alpha-AAA) , kynurenine) were significantly reduced after repeated AMPH. Acute AMPH caused in 129Sv a significant reduction of valine , lysophosphatidylcholines ( lysoPC a C16: 0 , lysoPC a C18: 2 , lysoPC a C20: 4) , phosphatidylcholine ( PC) diacyls ( PC aa C34: 2 , PC aa C36: 2 , PC aa C36: 3 , PC aa C36: 4) and alkyl-acyls ( PC ae C38: 4 , PC ae C40: 4). However , repeated AMPH increased the levels of valine and isoleucine , long-chain acylcarnitines ( C14 , C14: 1-OH , C16 , C18: 1) , PC diacyls ( PC aa C38: 4 , PC aa C38: 6 , PC aa C42: 6) , PC acyl-alkyls ( PC ae C38: 4 , PC ae C40: 4 , PC ae C40: 5 , PC ae C40: 6 , PC ae C42: 1 , PC ae C42: 3) and sphingolipids ( SM ( OH) C22: 1 , SM C24: 0) compared to acute AMPH in 129Sv. Hexoses and kynurenine were reduced after repeated AMPH compared to saline in 129Sv. The established changes probably reflect a shift in energy metabolism toward lipid molecules in 129Sv because of reduced level of hexoses. Pooled data from both strains showed that the elevation of isoleucine and leucine was a prominent biomarker of AMPH-induced behavioral sensitization. Simultaneously a significant decline of hexoses , citrulline , ADMA , and kynurenine occurred. The reduced levels of kynurenine , ADMA , and citrulline likely reflect altered function of N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA) and NO systems caused by repeated AMPH. Altogether , 129Sv strain displays stronger sensitization toward AMPH and larger variance in metabolite levels than Bl6.
