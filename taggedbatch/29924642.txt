Increased cytokines at high altitude: lack of effect of ibuprofen on acute mountain<disease> sickness , physiological variables or cytokine levels. High Alt Med Biol. 00:000-000 , 2018. There is no consensus on the role of inflammation<symptom> in high-altitude acclimatization. To determine the effects of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( ibuprofen 400 mg every 8 hours) on blood cytokines , acclimatization , acute mountain<disease> sickness ( AMS , Lake Louise Score) , and noninvasive oxygenation in brain and muscle in healthy volunteers. In this double-blind study , 20 volunteers were randomized to receive ibuprofen or placebo at sea level and for 48 hours at 3800 m altitude. Arterial , brain , and leg<symptom> muscle saturation with near infrared spectroscopy , pulse oximetry , and heart rate were measured. Blood samples were collected for cytokine levels and cytokine gene expression. All of the placebo subjects and 8 of 11 ibuprofen subjects developed AMS at altitude ( p = 0.22 , comparing placebo and ibuprofen). On arrival at altitude , the oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry ( S We found that ibuprofen , at the package-recommended adult dose , did not have a significant effect on altitude-related increases in cytokines , AMS scores , blood , or tissue oxygenation in a population of healthy subjects with a high incidence of AMS.
