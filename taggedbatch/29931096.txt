 The current study examined a large community cohort to understand relationships between indicators of alcohol consumption and hippocampal volume. Alcohol use measures were not associated with hippocampal volume in a population-based sample. However , alcohol consumption was associated with hippocampal volume reduction in subsets of the sample including subjects aged ≥ 50 years old , and those with none to moderate levels of depressive symptoms. A total of 1848 adults with magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) and alcohol consumption data were included. Multiple linear regressions were performed with left or right hippocampal volume as dependent variables , and age , gender , race , education , body mass index , Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology ( QIDS-SR) scores , drinks per week ( DPW) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) , AST/ALT , γ-glutamyl transferase and mean corpuscular volume ( MCV) as independent variables. Post hoc analyses were conducted to assess interactions of demographic factors and variables of interest ( DPW , AST , ALT , AST/ALT , GGT and MCV). For statistically significant interactions , analyses were conducted in groups split by gender , depression<symptom> ( QIDS-SR scores ≥ 11 and < 11) and age ( ≥ 50 and < 50 years). Average alcohol consumption in the population was low ( μ = 2.95 ± 6.7 DPW). Alcohol consumption measures were not significantly associated with hippocampal volume in the primary analysis. Exploratory analyses revealed significant associations between DPW and right hippocampal volume in participants with QIDS-SR scores < 11 ( B = -3.75 , P = 0.02 , CI = -6.97 , -0.52) and in those aged ≥ 50 years ( B = -4.844 , P = 0.023 CI = -9.023 to -0.664). AST/ALT was significantly associated with right ( B = -93.66 , P = 0.022 , CI = -173.64 to -13.68) and left hippocampal volume ( B = -109.79 P = 0.008 , CI = -190.97 to -28.61) in participants aged ≥ 50 but not < 50 years. Gender differences were not observed. The findings suggest a relationship between alcohol use indicators and right hippocampal volume in non-depressed and older adults.
