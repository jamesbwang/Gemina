 The oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate is catalysed only by a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent malate dehydrogenase encoded by SCO4827 in Streptomyces<pathogen> coelicolor. A mutant lacking the malate dehydrogenase gene was isolated and no enzymatic activity was detected. As expected , the âˆ† mdh mutant was unable to grow on malate as the sole carbon source. However , the mutant grew less in minimal medium with glucose and there was a delay of 36 h. The same behaviour was observed when the mutant was grown on minimal medium with casamino acids or glycerol. For unknown reasons , the mutant was not able to grow in YEME medium with glucose. The deficiency of malate dehydrogenase affected the expression of the isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase genes , decreasing the expression of both genes by approximately two- to threefold.
