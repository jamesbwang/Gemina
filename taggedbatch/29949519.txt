 Laser processing of carbon compounds towards the formation of graphene-based structures gains ground in view of the practicality that lasers offer against other conventional graphene preparation methods. The current work explores the viability of low-cost lasers , operating at ambient conditions , for the transformation of various graphitic materials to structures with graphene-like atomic arrangements. Starting materials are at two opposing sides. On one side stands the typical graphite crystal with Bernal stacking and strong sp
