 Epigenetic regulation of gene expression has a crucial role allowing for the self-renewal and differentiation of stem and progenitor populations during organogenesis. The mammalian kidney maintains a population of self-renewing stem cells that differentiate to give rise to thousands of nephrons , which are the functional units that carry out filtration to maintain physiological homeostasis. The polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2) epigenetically represses gene expression during development by placing the H3K27me3 mark on histone H3 at promoter and enhancer sites , resulting in gene silencing. To understand the role of PRC2 in nephron differentiation , we conditionally inactivated the
