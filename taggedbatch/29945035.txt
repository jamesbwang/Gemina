 Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles that protrude from the cell surface of many mammalian cell types , including endothelial and epithelial cells , osteoblasts , and neurons. These antennal-like projections enable cells to detect extracellular stimuli and elicit responses via intracellular signaling mechanisms. Primary cilia on endothelial cells lining blood vessels function as calcium-dependent mechanosensors that sense blood flow. In doing so , they facilitate the regulation of hemodynamic parameters within the vascular system. Defects in endothelial primary cilia result in inappropriate blood flow-induced responses and contribute to the development of vascular dysfunctions , including atherosclerosis , hypertension , and aneurysms<disease>. This review examines the current understanding of vascular endothelial cilia structure and function and their role in the vascular system. Future directions for primary cilia research and treatments for ciliary-based pathologies are discussed.
