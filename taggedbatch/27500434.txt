 Tissue damage following injury triggers the processes of coagulation , inflammation<symptom> and healing. In tissues surrounding the bone , the result of the healing process is a scar , while bone tissue has a unique ability to achieve shape , strength and pre-injury function. Bone healing is a process of regeneration rather than classic recovery. The result of this process is the formation of new , healthy bone tissue instead of a scar. Many factors can inhibit or impair the bone healing process , and their influence is critical during the stages of inflammation<symptom> and angiogenesis and finally on the clinical outcome. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) play an essential role associated with their analgesic potency and anti-inflammatory effects. NSAIDs are also the most often used drugs in patients who require pain control and inflammation<symptom> reduction due to musculoskeletal diseases or injures. Although their analgesic effect is well documented , NSAIDs also interfere with bone healing; therefore , the relative benefits and disadvantages connected with their administration should be taken into consideration. Despite the negative effect , NSAIDs have beneficial properties , but their clinical benefits in relation to dose and time of use are still unclear. Therefore , in this review , we focus on bone healing with relation to the impact of NSAIDs.
