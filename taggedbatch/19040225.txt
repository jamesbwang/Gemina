 This paper is a comprehensive study regarding the role of glutathione as a natural antioxidant on white wines aging potential. It includes sensory and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry ( FTICR-MS) metabolomics of aged chardonnay wines from 2008 to 2009 vintages , made after glutathione spiking at alcoholic fermentation or bottling. The closure effect was also considered. The sensory analysis revealed a clear vintage , closure and glutathione effect on wines oxidative character after several years of bottle aging. Spearman rank correlation was applied to link the sensory analysis and the exact mass information from FT-ICR-MS. FTICR-MS along with multivariate statistical analyses put in evidence that glutathione efficiency against wines sensory oxidative stability is related to wines antioxidant metabolome consisting of N- and S- containing compounds like amino acids , aromatic compounds and peptides. The chemical composition and origin of wines antioxidant metabolome suggests that its management since the very beginning of the vinification process is a key factor to estimate wines aging potential.
