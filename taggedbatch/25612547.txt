 Surgeries with single port access have been gaining ground among surgeons who seek minimally invasive procedures. Although this technique uses only one access , the incision is larger when compared to laparoscopic cholecystectomy and this fact can lead to a higher incidence of incisional hernias. To compare the incidence of incisional hernia after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and by single port. A total of 57 patients were randomly divided into two groups and submitted to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( n = 29) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy by single access ( n = 28). The patients were followed up and reviewed in a 40.4 month follow-up for identification of incisional hernias. Follow-up showed 21,4 % of incisional hernia in single port group and 3.57 % in conventional technique. There was a higher incidence of late incisional hernia in patients submitted to single port access cholecystectomy compared to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
