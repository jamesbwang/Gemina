 The onset of schizophrenia occurs during a period critical for development of social relationships and functional independence. As such , interventions that target the early course of illness have the potential to stave off functional decline and restore functioning to pre-illness levels. In this entirely remote study , people with recent-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders ( SSDs) participated in a 12-week randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of PRIME ( personalized real-time intervention for motivational enhancement) , a mobile-based digital health intervention designed to improve motivation and quality of life. Participants were randomized into the PRIME ( n = 22) or treatment-as-usual/waitlist ( TAU/WL) condition ( n = 21) and completed assessments at baseline , post-trial ( 12 wk) , and for people in the PRIME condition , 3 months after the end of the trial. After 12-weeks , WL participants received PRIME , resulting in a total sample of 38 participants completing PRIME. In PRIME , participants worked towards self-identified goals with the support of a virtual community of age-matched peers with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders as well as motivation coaches. Compared to the WL condition , people in the PRIME condition had significantly greater improvements in self-reported depression<symptom> , defeatist beliefs , self-efficacy , and a trend towards motivation/pleasure negative symptoms post-trial , and these improvements were maintained 3 months after the end of trial. We also found that people in the PRIME condition had significantly greater improvements in components of social motivation post-trial ( anticipated pleasure and effort expenditure). Our results suggest that PRIME has the potential to be an effective mobile-based intervention for improving aspects of mood and motivation in young people with SSDs.
