 Losing weight and keeping it off for the long term is difficult. Weight regain is common. Experiences of successful non-surgical weight<symptom> loss<symptom> after severe obesity are largely unexplored. We know little about long-term weight<symptom> loss<symptom> processes , and how health care services can be of help to those living them. Drawing on in-depth interviews of 8 women and 2 men , the aim of this phenomenological study is to describe the experiences of adults who have been severely obese , who have lost weight and maintained weight<symptom> loss<symptom> for the long term ( > 5 years). Findings show that after severe obesity , sustained weight<symptom> loss<symptom> has no endpoint , yet is always easy to end. Keeping weight off means committing to oneself , continuing profound changes and cultivating sensitivity towards oneself and others. A phenomenological understanding of sustained weight<symptom> loss<symptom> can inform professionals who deal with health issues and challenges occurring in the life of people leaving severe obesity.
