 Optofluidic single-cell genome amplification was used to obtain genome sequences from sub-micron cells collected from the euphotic and mesopelagic zones of the northwestern Sargasso Sea. Plankton cells were visually selected and manually sorted with an optical trap , yielding 20 partial genome sequences representing seven bacterial phyla. Two organisms , E01-9C-26 (
