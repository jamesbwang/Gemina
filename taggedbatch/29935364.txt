 Prolonged replication arrest on damaged templates is a cause of fork collapse , potentially resulting in genome instability. Arrested replication is rescued by translesion DNA synthesis ( TLS) and homologous recombination ( HR)- mediated template switching. SPARTAN , a ubiquitin-PCNA-interacting regulator , regulates TLS via mechanisms incompletely understood. Here we show that SPARTAN promotes diversification of the chicken DT40 immunoglobulin-variable Î» gene by facilitating TLS-mediated hypermutation and template switch-mediated gene-conversion , both induced by replication blocks at abasic sites.
