 Tricuspid regurgitation is a common finding in patients with left-sided valvular or myocardial disease , often being a marker for late-stage chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with a grim prognosis. However , isolated tricuspid valve surgery remains infrequent and is associated with the highest mortality among all valve procedures. Hence , a largely unmet clinical need exists for less invasive therapeutic options in these patients. In recent times , multiple percutaneous therapies have been developed for treating severe tricuspid regurgitation , including tricuspid valve repair and , more recently replacement , opening an entirely new venue for managing tricuspid regurgitation. The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview and a clinical perspective on novel transcatheter tricuspid valve therapies , highlighting potential challenges and future directions.
