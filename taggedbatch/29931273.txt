 The nutritional profile of human milk varies significantly between women , and the impact of maternal diet on these variations is not well understood. We analyzed breast-milk vitamin B-12 concentration and vitamin B-12 supplement use pattern among women who adhered to different dietary patterns: vegan , vegetarian , and nonvegetarian. A total of 74 milk samples , 29 from vegan , 19 from vegetarian , and 26 from nonvegetarian breastfeeding mothers , were analyzed. The prevalences of low vitamin B-12 ( < 310 pmol/L) were 19.2 % for vegans , 18.2 % for vegetarians , and 15.4 % for nonvegetarians , which was not significant by diet group ( P = 1.00). The median ( quartile 1 , quartile 3) vitamin B-12 values were 558 pmol/L ( 331 , 759 pmol/L) for vegans , 509 pmol/L ( 368 , 765 pmol/L) for vegetarians , and 444 pmol/L ( 355 , 777 pmol/L) for nonvegetarians ( P = 0.890). The use of individual vitamin B-12 supplements was higher in vegans ( 46.2 %) than in vegetarians ( 27.3 %) and nonvegetarians ( 3.9 %) ( P = 0.001). In linear regression analysis , the use of individual vitamin B-12 supplements was a significant positive predictor of milk vitamin B-12 concentration ( β ± SE: 172.9 ± 75.2; standardized β = 0.263; P = 0.024; R2 = 0.069) , the use of a multivitamin had a significant negative relation with milk vitamin B-12 concentrations ( β ± SE -222.0 ± 98.7; standardized β = -0.258; P = 0.028 , R2 = 0.067 ;-RRB- , whereas the use of a B-complex vitamin and prenatal vitamin were not predictive of vitamin B-12 milk concentration ( P > 0.05). Almost 20 % of our study participants were classified as having low breast-milk vitamin B-12 concentrations ( < 310 pmol/L) , independent of maternal diet pattern. Approximately 85 % of participants categorized as having low vitamin B-12 were taking vitamin B-12 supplements at doses in excess of the Recommended Dietary Allowance , which suggests that more research is needed to determine breast-milk adequacy values.
