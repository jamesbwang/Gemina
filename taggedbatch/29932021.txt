 Lesbian , gay , and bisexual ( LGB) youth have elevated suicidality rates. To investigate LGB-related and other factors associated with suicide attempts , suicidal ideation , and future suicide risk in a large UK sample. Logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with suicidality in 3,275 LGB young adults from the Youth Chances project. Suicide attempts ( lifetime) were reported by 13.6 % of participants; 45.2 % had suicidal ideation in the past year and 9.5 % said future suicide attempts were likely. LGB stigma and discrimination experiences were significantly associated with all three aspects of suicidality. These included school stigma factors ( e.g. , teachers not speaking out against prejudice , lessons being negative about sexual minorities) , negative reactions to coming out from family and friends , and LGB-related harassment or crime experiences. Bisexuality , not feeling accepted where one lives , younger sexual minority identification , and younger coming out were also associated with suicidality. Significant non-LGB factors included female gender , lower social support , anxiety/depression help-seeking , experiences of abuse/violence , and sexual abuse. This study is cross-sectional and further research is needed to test out whether any of these factors have a causal relationship with suicidality. A wide range of LGB stigma and discrimination experiences are associated with increased suicidality in LGB youth. Health , social care , and education professionals supporting young people should address LGB-specific risk factors.
