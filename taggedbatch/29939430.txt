 The separation methods of the enantiomers of two β-blockers and tryptophan were studied using capillary electrochromatography with heparin covalently as well as non-covalently , bonded onto the capillary inner wall as stationary phase and electrokinetic chromatography with heparin as pseudostationary phase. In the case of heparin , used as a stationary phase , the method was unable to resolve enantiomers in both cases β-blockers and tryptophan. On the other hand , when heparin was used as a pseudostationary phase , the resolution of the enantiomers was obtained only with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane which were immobilised onto the inner phase of the capillary. The results of this study let us infer that the electrostatic , hydrophobic , and steric interactions were involved in the separation mechanisms. The separation was achieved in less than 10 minutes under the optimized conditions: 30 mM phosphate buffer ( pH 2.5) with the adding of 15 mg/mL of heparin at 15 °C and 10 kV. The usefulness of heparin as a chiral selector both in electrokinetic chromatography using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane attached to the capillary was demonstrated for the first time. The developed method was powerful , sensitive , and fast , and it could be considered an important alternative to conventional methods used for chiral separation.
