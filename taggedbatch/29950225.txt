 To analyze the success rate and influencing factors for collecting peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells ( HSC) by combination of cyclophosphamide ( CTX) or E-CHOP chemotherapy combined with granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF) in patients with multiple myeloma. The clinical data of 75 patients with multiple myeloma in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received CTX or E-CHOP chemotherapy combined with G-CSF mobilization to collect HSC , and the success rate ( CD34 A total of 86 collections by mobilization were performed in 75 patients , with the average 3.22 ( 0.12-22.28) Ã— 10 There are no significant effects of sex , disease type , ISS staging and mobilization methods on the success rate of HSC collection in patients with multiple myeloma , and the less course number of chemotherapy ( < 5) before collection show a higher success rate of HSC collection.
