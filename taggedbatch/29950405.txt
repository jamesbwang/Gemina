 Functional characterization of adenylyl cyclase ( AC) isoforms has proven challenging in mammalian cells because of the endogenous expression of multiple AC isoforms and the high background cAMP levels induced by nonselective AC activators. To simplify the characterization of individual transmembrane AC ( mAC) isoforms , we generated a human embryonic kidney cell line 293 ( HEK293) with low cAMP levels by knocking out two highly expressed ACs , AC3 and AC6 , using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Stable HEK293 cell lines lacking either AC6 ( HEK-ACΔ6) or both AC3 and AC6 ( HEK-ACΔ3/ 6) were generated. Knockout was confirmed genetically and by comparing cAMP responses of the knockout cells to the parental cell line. HEK-ACΔ6 and HEK-ACΔ3/ 6 cells revealed an 85 % and 95 % reduction in the forskolin-stimulated cAMP response , respectively. Forskolin- and G
