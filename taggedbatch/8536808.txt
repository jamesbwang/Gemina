 Despite early and ongoing dietary management with a phe-restricted diet , suboptimal neuropsychological function has been observed in PKU. The restrictive nature of the PKU diet may expose patients to sub-optimal nutritional intake and deficiencies which may impact normal brain function. A systematic review of the published literature was carried out , where possible with meta-analysis , to compare the status of nutrients ( Nutrients: DHA , EPA phospholipids , selenium , vitamins B Of 1534 publications identified , 65 studies met the entry criteria. Significantly lower levels of DHA , EPA and cholesterol were found for PKU patients compared to healthy controls. No significant differences in zinc , vitamins B The current data show that PKU patients have lower availability of DHA , EPA and cholesterol. Compliance with the phe-restricted diet including the micronutrient fortified protein substitute ( PS) is essential to ensure adequate micronutrient status. Given the complexity of the diet , patients ' micronutrient and fatty acid status should be continuously monitored , with a particular focus on patients who are non-compliant or poorly compliant with their PS. Given their key role in brain function , assessment of the status of nutrients where limited data was found ( e.g. choline , iodine) should be undertaken. Standardised reporting of studies in PKU would strengthen the output of meta-analysis and so better inform best practice for this rare condition.
