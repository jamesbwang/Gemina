 Chronic kidney disease is a major health-care problem worldwide and its cost is becoming no longer affordable. Indeed , restoring damaged renal structures or building a new kidney represents an ambitious and ideal alternative to renal replacement therapy. Streams of research have explored the possible application of pluripotent stem cells ( SCs) ( embryonic SCs and induced pluripotent SCs) in different strategies aimed at regenerate functioning nephrons and at understanding the mechanisms of kidney regeneration. Areas covered: In this review , we will focus on the main potential applications of human pluripotent SCs to kidney regeneration , including those leading to rebuilding new kidneys or part of them ( organoids , scaffolds , biological microdevices) as well as those aimed at understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of renal disease and regenerative processes ( modeling of kidney disease , genome editing). Moreover , we will discuss the role of endogenous renal progenitors cells in order to understand and promote kidney regeneration , as an attractive alternative to pluripotent SCs. Expert opinion: Opportunities and pitfalls of all these strategies will be underlined , finally leading to the conclusion that a deeper knowledge of the biology of pluripotent SCs is mandatory , in order to allow us to hypothesize their clinical application.
