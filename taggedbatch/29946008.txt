 To investigate prevalence , management and characteristics of asthma patients with frequent exacerbations. Data from asthma patients ( ≥ 18 years) identified in primary care medical records were linked to national Swedish health registries. Exacerbations defined as hospitalisations , emergency visits and/or collection of oral steroids. Frequent exacerbations defined as ≥ 2 exacerbations/year during the 3-year observation period. Of 18 724 asthma patients , 81.49 % had no exacerbation and 6.43 % had frequent exacerbations the year prior index. Frequent exacerbations yearly were observed for 1.8 % of the patients. Frequent exacerbators were older , more often females , had increased eosinophil and neutrophil counts , lower lung function , and more comorbidities than patients without exacerbations. There was a slight increase in asthma medication claims and a slight decrease in physician visits compared to baseline , both in the group with and the group without frequent exacerbations. Patients with frequent exacerbations were characterized by greater age , female predominance , high eosinophilic and neutrophilic count and high prevalence of comorbidities. This study indicates that the Swedish health care system lack efficiency to adjust treatment and management for this patient group. With new treatment options targeting severe asthma available , identification of these patients should be in focus to ensure reduction of exacerbations.
