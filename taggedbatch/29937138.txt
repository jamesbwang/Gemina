 Compare physical activity ( PA) levels in adults with and without type 1 diabetes and identify diabetes-specific barriers to PA.. Forty-four individuals with type 1 diabetes and 77 non-diabetic controls in the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes study wore an accelerometer for 2 weeks. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA) was compared by diabetes status using multiple linear regression. The Barriers to Physical Activity in Type 1 Diabetes questionnaire measured diabetes-specific barriers to PA , and the Clarke hypoglycemia awareness questionnaire measured hypoglycemia frequency. Individuals with type 1 diabetes engaged in less MVPA , fewer bouts of MVPA , and spent less time in MVPA bouts per week than individuals without diabetes ( all p < 0.05) , despite no difference in self-reported PA ( p > 0.05). The most common diabetes-specific barrier to PA was risk of hypoglycemia. Individuals with diabetes reporting barriers spent less time in MVPA bouts per week than those not reporting barriers ( p = 0.047). Individuals with type 1 diabetes engage in less MVPA than those without diabetes despite similar self-reported levels , with the main barrier being perceived risk of hypoglycemia. Adults with type 1 diabetes require guidance to meet current PA guidelines and reduce cardiovascular risk.
