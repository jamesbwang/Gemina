 Butyric acid is an important chemical currently produced from petrochemical feedstocks. Its production from renewable , low-cost biomass in fermentation has attracted large attention in recent years. In this study , the feasibility of corn husk , an abundant agricultural residue , for butyric acid production by using Hydrolysis of corn husk ( 10 % solid loading) with 0.4 M H A high concentration of total reducing sugars at ~ 50 % ( w/w) yield was obtained from corn husk after acid hydrolysis. Stable butyric acid production from corn husk hydrolysate was achieved in repeated-batch fermentation with
