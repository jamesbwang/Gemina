 About 40 % of the new HIV<pathogen> infections in Ethiopia are among children < 15 years of age. The great majority of these infections occur through Mother-to-child HIV<pathogen> transmission ( MTCT). For prevention of MTCT , the national guidelines has been revised to incorporate scientific advances in HIV<pathogen> prevention , treatment and care. Since 2005 , the country has been implementing a peer mentor programme called Mother Support Group ( MSG) , which provides psychosocial and adherence support for HIV<pathogen> positive mothers. This study examined implementation of PMTCT guidelines revisions and outcomes of HIV<pathogen> exposed babies in the MSG in Addis Ababa. Retrospective routine data were collected between 2005 and August 2013 from seven randomly selected primary health facilities. Odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated using logistic regression models. Several guidelines revisions were made between 2001 and 2013 in HIV<pathogen> testing approaches , prophylactic antiretroviral options , infant feeding recommendations and infant HIV<pathogen> testing algorithms. Revisions on the CD4 thresholds were associated with a significant increase in the proportion of women initiating antiretroviral treatment from 0 in 2005 to 62 % in 2013. Revisions in infant feeding recommendations led to a 92.3 % reported practice of exclusive breastfeeding in 2013 compared to 60.9 % in 2005. Two and four percent of the HIV<pathogen> exposed babies were HIV<pathogen> positive by six and 18 months respectively. Not receiving prophylactic ART and receiving mixed feeding were independent predictors for babies having an HIV<pathogen> positive antibody test at 18 months. The rate of HIV<pathogen> status disclosure increased significantly year by year. Over the years , the PMTCT recommendations have moved from having a solo focus on PMTCT to holistic and inclusive approaches emphasizing survival beyond HIV<pathogen> prevention. The data reflect favourable outcomes of HIV<pathogen> exposed babies in terms of averted MTCT though serious gaps in data quality remain. For successful implementation of Option-B plus , the identified gaps in the MSG need to be addressed.
