 This study examines college men 's ( N = 635) and women 's ( N = 650) reports of women 's resistance against unwanted sexual and social advances. Men completed surveys to assess ( a) initiation of unwanted sexual contact with a female partner , ( b) initiation of unwanted sexual intercourse with a female partner , ( c) sexual situations where a female partner decided she did not want to proceed , ( d) encouraging a woman to drink when they were aware that the woman did not want to , and ( e) attempting to take a woman to an isolated location against her will. Women completed corresponding questionnaires regarding the receipt of such unwanted advances , the outcome of the situation , and the resistance tactics utilized. Many men ( 5 % -46 %) and women ( 15 % -38 %) initiated or experienced , respectively , at least one of the five unwanted sexual or social advances. Unwanted sexual and social advances most often stopped as a result of women 's verbal and physical resistance. Few advances ( 0 % -8 %) stopped as a result of bystander intervention. In addition to decreasing men 's likelihood of engaging in unwanted sexual and social advances , these data highlight the importance of educating women on the effectiveness of verbal and physical resistance tactics , and increasing the frequency of prosocial bystander action on college campuses.
