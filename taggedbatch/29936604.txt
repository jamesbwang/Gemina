 Transgender women ( TW) are one of the highest risk groups for HIV<pathogen> infection globally; however , the HIV<pathogen> testing needs of their cisgender ( non-transgender) male partners remain largely unknown. This study sought to examine the perceived acceptability of couples HIV<pathogen> testing and counseling ( CHTC) for TW-male dyads from the perspective of cisgender men who partner with TW. Between September 2016 and June 2017 , 19 cisgender men ( mean age = 40.1 , SD = 12.8) who currently have , or have ever had a TW partner completed an in-depth semi-structured phone interview and brief survey to gather data on acceptability of CHTC , as well as perceived barriers and facilitators to CHTC for TW-male couples. Qualitative data were thematically analyzed and integrated with survey data. Acceptability of CHTC was high in the sample ( 89.5 %) but was complex and largely contingent on: ( 1) monogamy and commitment as critical precursors to CHTC acceptability; ( 2) risk perception and level of comfort with CHTC; ( 3) understandings of sexual agreements; and ( 4) personal relationships versus other TW-male relationships. Findings have implications for culturally-adapting and implementing CHTC in real-world settings for TW-male couples , as well as for meeting the individual HIV<pathogen> testing needs of cisgender men who partner with TW.
