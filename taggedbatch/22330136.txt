 Studies have shown that miR-17-5p plays an important role in the development of cancer. The aim of this meta-analysis was to quantitatively analyze the association of miR-17-5p with prognosis in various cancers. We searched the PubMed , EMBASE , Web of Science , and Cochrane library databases for relevant studies through August 2017. The prognostic data and clinico-pathological features of overall survival ( OS) and disease-free survival ( DFS) were extracted to investigate the association between miR-17-5p expression and tumor prognosis. In addition , odds ratios ( ORs) were used to assess the correlations between miR-17-5p expression and clinicopathological characteristics. A total of ten studies were incorporated into this systematic review , and we found that high miR-17-5p expression can predict poor OS for malignancies ( combined hazard ratio ( HR) = 1.87; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.37-2.55; Elevated expression of miR-17-5p suggested a poor prognosis in cancer patients and may serve as a new tumor marker to monitor cancer development and progression.
