 CRISPR/Cas9 is an attractive platform to potentially correct dominant genetic diseases by gene editing with unprecedented precision. In the current proof-of-principle study , we explored the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene-editing in myotonic dystrophy type-1 ( DM1) , an autosomal-dominant muscle disorder , by excising the CTG-repeat expansion in the 3 '- untranslated-region ( UTR) of the human myotonic dystrophy protein kinase ( DMPK) gene in DM1 patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells ( DM1-iPSC) , DM1-iPSC-derived myogenic cells and DM1 patient-specific myoblasts. To eliminate the pathogenic gain-of-function mutant DMPK transcript , we designed a dual guide RNA based strategy that excises the CTG-repeat expansion with high efficiency , as confirmed by Southern blot and single molecule real-time ( SMRT) sequencing. Correction efficiencies up to 90 % could be attained in DM1-iPSC as confirmed at the clonal level , following ribonucleoprotein ( RNP) transfection of CRISPR/Cas9 components without the need for selective enrichment. Expanded CTG repeat excision resulted in the disappearance of ribonuclear foci , a quintessential cellular phenotype of DM1 , in the corrected DM1-iPSC , DM1-iPSC-derived myogenic cells and DM1 myoblasts. Consequently , the normal intracellular localization of the muscleblind-like splicing regulator 1 ( MBNL1) was restored , resulting in the normalization of splicing pattern of SERCA1. This study validates the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene editing of repeat expansions.
