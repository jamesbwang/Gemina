 MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are a small functional non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression through mRNA degradation or translational repression. miRNAs are key regulatory components of various cellular networks. Current evidence support that multiple mammalian genome-encoded miRNAs impact the cellular biology , including proliferation , apoptosis , differentiation , and tumorigenesis , by targeting specific subsets of mRNAs. This minireview is focused on the current themes underlying the interactions between miRNAs and their mRNA targets and pathways in prostate tumorigenesis and progression , and their potential clinical utility as biomarkers for prostate cancer. Impact statement The primary goal of this article was to review recent literature on miRNA biogenesis and further elaborate on the identity of newly discovered miRNAs and their potential functional significance in the complex biological network associated with prostate tumorigenesis and disease progression and as biomarkers for prostate cancer.
