 To demonstrate whether the distance between the middle point of the patellar tendon and posterior cruciate ligament ( PT-PCL) calculated on a single axial MR image could be an alternative measure to tibial tubercle-PCL ( TT-PCL) distance for TT lateralization without the need of imaging processing. To show that normalization of PT-PCL ( nPT-PCL) against the maximum diameter of the tibial plateau may help to identify patients with patellar instability ( PI). MR scans of 30 patients ( 13 females , age 32 ± 13 years) with known PI and 60 patients ( 31 females , age 39 ± 19 years) with no history of PI were reviewed. Two operators calculated TT-PCL , and PT-PCL nPT-PCL. Intraclass correlation coefficient , Student 's t-test , Receiver Operator Characteristic curves , Spearman 's Rho and McNemar 's test were used. Interobserver reproducibility was 0.894 for PT-PCL for TT-PCL ( 95 % CI = 0.839-0.930) and 0.866 for TT-PCL ( 95 % CI = 0.796-0.912). The PT-PCL was 23.5 ± 3.8 mm in patients and 20.0 ± 2.7 mm in controls ( P < 0.001). The TT-PCL was 22.9 ± 3.9 mm in patients and 20.5 ± 2.7 mm in controls ( P = 0.002). Correlation between the PT-PCL and TT-PCL was R = 0.838 , P < 0.001. The PT-PCL had 66.6 % ( 95 % CI = 0.542-0.790) diagnostic yield. The nPT-PCL was significantly higher in patients ( 0.302 ± 0.03) than controls ( 0.271 ± 0.03; P < 0.001) with 73.9 % ( 95 % CI = 0.628-0.851) diagnostic yield. The PT-PCL correlated with TT-PCL , with 66.6 % diagnostic yield. The nPT-PCL may represent an additional index , with 73.9 % diagnostic yield.
