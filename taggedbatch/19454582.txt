 Germline mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase B ( SDHB) gene predispose to hereditary paraganglioma ( PGL) syndrome<pathogen><disease><symptom> type 4. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcome of treatment strategies for patients with head and neck paraganglioma ( HNPGL) carrying SDHB germline mutations. This was a retrospective evaluation of patients with HNPGL carrying SDHB germline mutations in the Netherlands. In a Dutch nationwide cohort study of SDHB germline mutation carriers , 54 patients with a total of 62 HNPGLs were identified. Forty-one of 54 patients ( 76 per cent) visited the outpatient clinic because of associated complaints. Eight patients ( 15 per cent) had multiple PGLs. One patient ( 2 per cent) developed a phaeochromocytoma and three ( 6 per cent) developed a malignant PGL. Twenty-seven patients ( 50 per cent) had an operation for their HNPGL and 15 ( 28 per cent) received radiotherapy. Three patients with HNPGL ( 6 per cent) were diagnosed with additional non-paraganglionic tumours. If an SDHB germline mutation is identified in a patient with HNPGL , the clinician should be aware of the variable manifestations of the SDHB-linked tumour syndrome<disease><symptom> , the risk of catecholamine excess , concurrent phaeochromocytoma , and association with non-paraganglionic tumours.
