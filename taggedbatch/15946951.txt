 Nylon hydrolase ( NylC) is initially expressed as an inactive precursor ( 36 kDa). The precursor is cleaved autocatalytically at Asn266/Thr267 to generate an active enzyme composed of an α subunit ( 27 kDa) and a β subunit ( 9 kDa). Four αβ heterodimers ( molecules A-D) form a doughnut-shaped quaternary structure. In this study , the thermostability of the parental NylC was altered by amino acid substitutions located at the A/D interface ( D122G/H130Y/D36A/ L137A) or the A/B interface ( E263Q) and spanned a range of 47 °C. Considering structural , biophysical , and biochemical analyses , we discuss the structural basis of the stability of nylon hydrolase. From the analytical centrifugation data obtained regarding the various mutant enzymes , we conclude that the assembly of the monomeric units is dynamically altered by the mutations. Finally , we propose a model that can predict whether the fate of the nascent polypeptide will be correct subunit assembly , inappropriate protein-protein interactions causing aggregation , or intracellular degradation of the polypeptide.
