 Reconstitution of membrane proteins in artificial membranes<symptom> is an essential prerequisite for functional studies that depend on the context of an intact membrane. While straight-forward protocols for reconstituting proteins in small unilamellar vesicles were developed many years ago , it is much more difficult to prepare large membranes<symptom> containing membrane proteins at biologically relevant concentrations. Giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs) represent a model system that is characterised by low curvature , controllable tension , and large surface that can be easily visualised with microscopy , but protein insertion is notoriously difficult. Here we describe a convenient method for efficient generation of GUVs containing functionally active SNARE proteins that govern exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Preparation of proteo-GUVs requires a simple , in-house-built device , standard and inexpensive electronic equipment , and employs a straight-forward protocol that largely avoids damage of the proteins. The procedure allows upscaling and multiplexing , thus providing a platform for establishing and optimizing preparation of GUVs containing membrane proteins for a diverse array of applications.
