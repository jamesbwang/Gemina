 Recently several studies demonstrated a role for the Wnt pathway in lymphocyte<symptom> development and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs). B-1 cells constitute a separate lineage of B lymphocytes , originating during fetal hematopoiesis , expressing lymphoid and myeloid markers and possessing self-renewal ability , similar to early hematopoietic progenitors and HSCs. A plethora of studies have shown an important role for the evolutionary conserved Wnt pathway in the biology of HSCs and T lymphocyte<symptom> development. Our previous data demonstrated abundant expression of Wnt pathway components by B-1 cells , including Wnt ligands and receptors. Here we report that the canonical Wnt pathway is activated in B-1 cell precursors , but not in mature B-1 cells. However , both B-1 precursors and B-1 cells are able to respond to Wnt ligands in vitro. Canonical Wnt activity promotes proliferation of B-1 cells , while non-canonical Wnt signals induce the expansion of B-1 precursors. Interestingly , using a co-culture system with OP9 cells , Wnt3a stimulus supported the generation of B-1a cells. Taking together , these results indicate that B-1 cells and their progenitors are differentially responsive to Wnt ligands , and that the balance<symptom> of activation of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling may regulate the maintenance and differentiation of different B-1 cell subsets.
