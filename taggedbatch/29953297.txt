 This study investigates the effect of a supplementary ketone , Î²-hydroxybutyrate ( BHB) , on walking economy and ratings of perceived exertion in apparently healthy individuals. In a repeated-measures , crossover design , ten non-aerobically trained participants ( three males; seven females) performed two stages of a duration-modified Bruce treadmill protocol. Participants blindly consumed either 1 ounce of an exogenous BHB solution ( KETO) or a noncaloric placebo ( CON) 30 minutes prior to exercise testing. Blood ketone and glucose concentrations were measured prior to supplementation ( baseline) , immediately before exercise , and after exercise. Oxygen consumption ( VO
