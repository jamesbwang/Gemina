 This article is concerned with the study of biodegradation of an organophosphorus herbicide ( glyphosate) using unacclimated activated sludge. Glyphosate at different concentrations ( 0.1 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 and 5 g/L) was tested for cellular growth. On the other hand , the effect of glyphosate on its own biodegradation was studied by evaluating the fittings of different kinetic models ( Andrews , Aiba et al. , Han and Levenspiel , Luong , Tessier , Webb , Tseng and Wayman , Yano and Koga). According to the obtained results , the activated sludge was able to use glyphosate as the sole carbon source; however , 2 and 5 g/L glyphosate seemed to inhibit cellular growth. Moreover , glyphosate at initial concentrations of 0.1 , 0.5 and 1 g/L was completely degraded within 4 , 13 and 18 h of incubation , respectively. Yano and Koga model was the best-fit model ( R
