 To identify distinct longitudinal patterns of body mass index ( BMI) z score in type 1 diabetes from childhood to young adulthood and secondly to determine sex differences as well as associated clinical covariates. A total of 5665 patients with type 1 diabetes ( 51 % male) with follow-up from 8 to 20 years of age from the multicenter diabetes prospective registry DPV were studied ( baseline diabetes duration â‰¥ 1 years , BMI z score aggregated per year of life). Latent class growth modeling ( SAS: PROC TRAJ) was applied to analyze BMI z score over time. Six distinct BMI z score trajectories were identified ( group 1: 7 % of patients , group 2: 22 % , group 3: 20 % , group 4: 16 % , group 5: 25 % , and group 6: 10 %). Group 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 had an almost stable BMI z score , either in the low , near-normal , high stable , or chronic overweight range. Group 3 ( 60 % girls) increased their BMI during puberty , whereas group 4 ( 65 % boys) had a BMI decrease. Similar patterns were observed for girls only , whereas boys followed nearly stable trajectories without fluctuation over time. Between the near-normal and the other groups , significant differences ( P < .05) in sex ratio , migration background , mental health , height z score , glycated hemoglobin A1c , diabetes treatment , dyslipidemia , hypertension , and smoking were observed. In youth with type 1 diabetes , a great heterogeneity of BMI z score trajectories exists that highlight the importance of personalized sex-specific intervention programs for subjects at risk for unfavorable BMI development.
