 Microtubule-associated protein 2c ( MAP2c) 1 is a 49-kDa intrinsically disordered protein regulating the dynamics of microtubules in developing neurons. MAP2c differs from its sequence homologue Tau in the pattern and kinetics of phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKA). Moreover , the mechanisms through which MAP2c interacts with its binding partners and the conformational changes and dynamics associated with these interactions remain unclear. Here , we used NMR relaxation and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement techniques to determine the dynamics and long-range interactions within MAP2c. The relaxation rates revealed large differences in flexibility of individual regions of MAP2c , with the lowest flexibility observed in the known and proposed binding sites. Quantitative conformational analyses of chemical shifts , small angle X-ray scattering ( SAXS) , and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement measurements disclosed that MAP2c regions interacting with important protein partners , including Fyn tyrosine kinase , plectin , and PKA , adopt specific conformations. High populations of poly-proline II and Î±-helices were found in Fyn- and plectin-binding sites of MAP2c , respectively. The region binding regulatory subunit of PKA consists of two helical motifs bridged by a more extended conformation. Of note , although MAP2c and Tau did not differ substantially in their conformations in regions of high sequence identity , we found that they differ significantly in long-range interactions , dynamics , and local conformation motifs in their N-terminal domains. These results highlight that the N-terminal regions of MAP2c provide important specificity to its regulatory roles and indicate a close relationship between MAP2c 's biological functions and conformational behavior.
