 This lecture explores the shared terrain between the new international history and the history of emotions. In the summer and fall of 1942 , American foreign correspondents played a key role in sparking a furore over British rule in India. Drawing on their own first-hand reporting from India , they depicted the British Empire as retrograde and abusive , a dangerous , destabilizing force and a threat to the post-war peace. Diagnosing what it called ` a new landslide of anti-British feeling ' , the British Ministry of Information spearheaded the formation of high-level , interdepartmental , secret committee charged with the task of figuring out how to reconcile Americans to the British Empire. What they found was that the job itself was impossible: a significant proportion of Americans ` whose views , they concluded , were driven in large measure by emotion ' would not under any circumstances soften their opinions about the British Empire.
