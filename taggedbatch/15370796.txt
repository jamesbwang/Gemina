 Out-of-hours ( OOH) services are often consulted for problems that are non-urgent. Some of these patients are frequent attenders ( FAs) who may constitute a heavy burden on the OOH service. The aim of the present study was to analyse FAs in a comprehensive material , covering all patients who have visited OOH services in Norway during a 10-year period. FA was defined as a patient having ≥ 5 consultations during one year. A cohort of all 15,172 FAs in 2008 was followed until 2017 , with a description of demographics , consultations , and diagnoses for each year. FAs in 2017 were also analysed with more extreme definitions ( ≥ 10 , ≥ 20 , ≥ 30 consultations). To analyse predictors for FA a logistic regression analysis was performed on the 2017 data. FAs constituted 2 % of all patients ( U-shaped age curve and female overrepresentation) and approximately 10 % of all consultations each year. 59.8 % of the cohort was never FA again , 17.7 % had one relapse , 8.6 % two , and 4.4 % had three relapses. 22.8 % was also a FA in 2009. Thereafter the percentage gradually declined to 6.2 % in 2017. Only 0.8 % of the original cohort were persistent FAs throughout the 10-year period. FAs were three times as likely to be given a psychological diagnosis as the average OOH patient , and this percentage increased in persistent and more extreme FAs. FAs tended to seek help at inconvenient hours ( late evening and night) , and increasingly so the more extreme they were. Also , they needed more consultation time and more often received home visits. The logistic regression analysis identified the following predictors for becoming FA ( odds ratio = OR): Female ( OR 1.17) , age 0-1 years ( OR 3.46) , age 70 + ( OR 1.57) , small municipality ( OR 1.61) , psychological diagnosis ( OR 10.00) , social diagnosis ( OR 5.97) , cancer ( OR 6.76) , diabetes ( OR 4.65) , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( OR 7.81). FAs were most common among the youngest children and among the elderly , increasing with age. Females were overrepresented , as were patients with psychosocial problems and various chronic somatic conditions. The majority were only temporary FAs.
