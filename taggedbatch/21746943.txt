 Calixarene derivatives are reported as potential therapeutic agents. Azo derivatives of calixarenes have not been given much consideration to explore their biomedical applications. In the present study , some azo-based derivatives of calix ( 4) arene were synthesized and characterized and their antibacterial and antiviral potentials were studied. The mono azo products of sulphanilamide , sulfaguanidine and 2-methyl-4-aminobenzoic acid showed good activity against bacterial strains with minimum inhibition concentration values ranging from 0.97 to 62.5 Î¼g/mL. For mono azo products , the diazotized salt was applied as a limiting reagent. The use of calix ( 4) arene and sodium acetate trihydrate in 1:3 ( molar ratio) helped in partial substitution. Molecular docking was performed to see the interaction of the designed compounds with two bacterial and one viral ( neuraminidase) receptor. Some of the derivatives showed good interaction with the active site of bacterial and neuraminidase enzymes through hydrogen , hydrophobic and pi-pi interactions , and could inhibit the activity of the selected enzymes.
