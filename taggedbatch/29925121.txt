 Lignans are polyphenolic compounds that are considered phytoestrogens for their plant origins , and they possess different biological activities. Three different extraction methods , ie , `` dilute and shoot '' , acidic hydrolysis , and enzymatic digestion , have been compared for extracting lignans ( secoisolariciresinol ( SECO) , matairesinol ( MAT) , and lariciresinol ( LARI)) from espresso coffee ( EC) by using high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) tandem mass spectrometry ( MS/MS). The best recovery values ( SECO: 97 % , LARI<pathogen>: 98 % , and MAT: 93 %) were obtained by using enzymatic hydrolysis with Clara-Diastase at 10 % ( w/v) , keeping the sample at 37 °C for 3 hours. For this reason , this method has been chosen and then applied to quantify lignans in 9 different EC samples from 5 different geographical origins ( Brazil , Colombia , El Salvador , Ethiopia , and India). Secoisolariciresinol and LARI were found in all EC samples from 27.9 to 52.0 μg L
