 Poroid hidradenoma ( PH) is a rare variant of benign sweat<symptom> gland neoplasm without connection to the epidermis. This tumor presents clinically as a solitary lesion<symptom> with a cystic component located in the subcutaneous layer abutting the skin. On ultrasound , it appears as a circumscribed complex cystic and solid mass abutting the dermis. The occurrence of PH in the breast is very rare. Its features overlap with intraductal papilloma and papillary carcinoma. A 66-year-old woman presented with a palpable lump in her right breast. Clinical examination revealed dark bluish dome-shaped nodule<disease> which presented as circumscribed round isodense mass on mammography and oval complex cystic and solid mass abutting the dermis on ultrasound. Clinically , a papillary neoplasm was suspected. The patient underwent En bloc surgical excision including the overlying epidermis and the surrounding adipose tissue to prevent recurrence. A well-demarcated , non-encapsulated grayish white mass composed of a partly solid and partly cystic area was completely removed and histopathologically confirmed as PH. At the 12-month follow-up , no recurrence was evident. PH should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a slowly growing breast mass that is bluish , cystic , and solid and abuts the dermis.
