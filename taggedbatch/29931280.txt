 DNA methylation datasets are growing ever larger both in sample size and genome coverage. Novel computational solutions are required to efficiently handle these data. We have developed meffil , an R package designed for efficient quality control , normalization and epigenome-wide association studies of large samples of Illumina Methylation BeadChip microarrays. A complete reimplementation of functional normalization minimizes computational memory without increasing running time. Incorporating fixed and random effects within functional normalization , and automated estimation of functional normalization parameters reduces technical variation in DNA methylation levels , thus reducing false positive rates and improving power. Support for normalization of datasets distributed across physically different locations without needing to share biologically-based individual-level data means that meffil can be used to reduce heterogeneity in meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association studies.
