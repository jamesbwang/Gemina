 Randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) examining warfarin use for stroke prevention in atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) may not accurately reflect real-world populations. We aimed to determine the representativeness of the RCT populations to real-world patients and to describe differences in the characteristics of trial populations from trial eligible patients in a real-world setting. We hypothesized that a significant fraction of real-world patients would not qualify for the RE-LY , ROCKET-AF , and ARISTOTLE trials and that real-world patients qualifying for the studies may have more strokes and bleeding events. We compared the inclusion and exclusion criteria , patient characteristics , and clinical outcomes from RE-LY , ROCKET-AF , and ARISTOTLE against data from the Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative ( MAQI
