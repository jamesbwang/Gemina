 Chronic exposure to diesel engine exhausts is associated with an increased risk of pulmonary diseases including lung cancer. Diesel engine exhausts contain large amounts of diesel exhaust particles ( DEP) on which are adsorbed several carcinogenic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Acute toxicity of high concentrations of DEP has been largely demonstrated in various in vitro cellular models. In contrast , the cellular and molecular impacts of low environmental concentrations of DEP on the phenotype of chronically exposed lung epithelial cells remain to be investigated. In the present study , we show that long term exposure ( 6 months) to 2 μg/ml ( 0.4 μg/cm
