 Surface-sensitive X-ray reflectivity and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering reveal the structure of polymer-capped-gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs that are grafted with poly ( N-isopropylacrylamide); PNIPAM-AuNPs) as they self-assemble and crystallize at the aqueous suspension/vapor interface. Citrate-stabilized AuNPs ( 5 and 10 nm in nominal diameter) are ligand-exchanged by 6 kDa PNIPAM-thiol to form corona brushes around the AuNPs that are highly stable and dispersed in aqueous suspensions. Surprisingly , no clear evidence of thermosensitive effect on surface enrichment or self-assembly of the PNIPAM-AuNPs is observed in the 10-35 Â°C temperature range. However , addition of simple salts ( in this case , NaCl) to the suspension induces migration of the PNIPAM-AuNPs to the aqueous surface , and above a threshold salt concentration , two-dimensional crystals are formed. The 10 nm PNIPAM-AuNPs form a highly ordered single layer with in-plane triangular structure , whereas the 5 nm capped NPs form short-range triangular structure that gradually becomes denser as salt concentration increases.
