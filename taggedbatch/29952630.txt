 The hypothesis that known words can serve as anchors for discovering new words in connected speech has computational and empirical support. However , evidence for how the bootstrapping effect of known words interacts with other mechanisms of lexical acquisition , such as statistical learning , is incomplete. In 3 experiments , we investigated the consequences of introducing a known word in an artificial language with no segmentation cues other than cross-syllable transitional probabilities. We started with an artificial language containing 4 trisyllabic novel words and observed standard above-chance performance in a subsequent recognition memory task. We then replaced 1 of the 4 novel words with a real word
