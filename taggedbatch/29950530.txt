 kidney transplantation has been developing rapidly in Indonesia in recent years , yet data on transplants ' characteristics and survival is still unavailable. In Indonesia , only living donors are permitted. Living donor are advantageous , but challenging to recruit. This study aimed to establish the graft and patient survival rates and to describe the characteristics of recipient and donor as well as the process of donor recruitment and evaluation of kidney transplantation in Indonesia. the study was a retrospective cohort on all donors and kidney transplant recipients at Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital ( CMGH) from January 2011 to May 2017. Only recipients from January 2011 to May 2014 were included to establish the 1-year and 3-year graft and patient survival; which were described using Kaplan-Meier method. data from 492 kidney transplant procedures were obtained ( donor median age , 30 ( 17- 66) years; 25.1 % were family-related. Recipients mean age , 47 ( SD 13.18 years). Data from total of 138 kidney transplant recipients were further analyzed. The 1-year death- censored graft survival , all-cause graft survival and patient survival were 92 % , 82.6 % and 87 %. The 3-year death-censored graft survival , all-cause graft survival and patient survival were 90.6 % , 76.1 % and 79.7 %. Kaplan-Meier 's curve showed the highest mortality rates occured in the early months. the 1-year graft and patient survival rate were 92 % and 87 %. The 3-year graft and patient survival rate were 90.6 % and 79.7 %. Only small percentage of donor were family-related. Living donor recruitment and evaluation are still a big challenge in Indonesia.
