 In this paper , we propose DeCoST ( Drug Repurposing from Control System Theory) framework to apply control system paradigm for drug repurposing purpose. Drug repurposing has become one of the most active areas in pharmacology since the last decade. Compared to traditional drug development , drug repurposing may provide more systematic and significantly less expensive approaches in discovering new treatments for complex<disease> diseases<disease>. Although drug repurposing techniques rapidly evolve from `` one: disease-gene-drug '' to `` multi: gene , dru '' and from `` lazy guilt-by-association '' to `` systematic model-based pattern matching , '' mathematical system and control paradigm has not been widely applied to model the system biology connectivity among drugs , genes , and diseases. In this paradigm , our DeCoST framework , which is among the earliest approaches in drug repurposing with control theory paradigm , applies biological and pharmaceutical knowledge to quantify rich connective data sources among drugs , genes , and diseases to construct disease-specific mathematical model. We use linear-quadratic regulator control technique to assess the therapeutic effect of a drug in disease-specific treatment. DeCoST framework could classify between FDA-approved drugs and rejected/withdrawn drug , which is the foundation to apply DeCoST in recommending potentially new treatment. Applying DeCoST in Breast Cancer and Bladder Cancer , we reprofiled 8 promising candidate drugs for Breast Cancer ER + ( Erbitux , Flutamide , etc.) , 2 drugs for Breast Cancer ER- ( Daunorubicin and Donepezil) and 10 drugs for Bladder Cancer repurposing ( Zafirlukast , Tenofovir , etc.).
