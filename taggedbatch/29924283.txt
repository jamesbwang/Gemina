 Tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> ( TB) is a major public health problem that , due to the clinical variability of its presentation , can be confused with cancer. The aim of this study was to identify the clinical-radiological characteristics and to describe the methodology that allowed to achieve a TB diagnosis in patients referred to the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases ( INEN) with a presumed diagnosis of cancer between 2014 and 2016. The study included 170 patients ( 52.4 % men) with an average age of 41.1 years; 18 % presented a history of contact with TB , and 5.9 % had had the disease previously. The TB was pulmonary in 22.4 % and extrapulmonary in 77.7 % of patients. The most frequent symptoms were respiratory , tumor , weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , and neurological. The cancer diagnoses most frequently discarded were lymphoma , lung cancer , and brain cancer. The lesions<symptom> that suggested a neoplasm indicated an advanced clinical stage in 63.5 %. Therefore , it follows that the symptoms and images associated with TB can be confused with malignant neoplasms.
