 Cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) is associated with bacterial pulmonary<disease> infections<disease> and neutrophil-dominated inflammation<symptom> in the airways. The aim of this study was to evaluate the neutrophil-derived protein Heparin-binding protein ( HBP) as a potential sputum<symptom> marker of airway inflammation<symptom> and bacterial load. Nineteen CF patients , aged 6-18 years , were prospectively followed for 6 months with sputum<symptom> sampling at every visit to the CF clinic. A total of 41 sputum<symptom> samples were collected. Sputum-HBP was analysed with ELISA , neutrophil elastase activity with a chromogenic assay , and total bacterial load with RT-PCR of the 16 s rDNA gene. Data were compared to lung function parameters and airway symptoms. HBP and elastase correlated to a decrease in FEV Sputum<symptom> HBP is a promising marker of airway inflammation<symptom> and pulmonary function in children with CF.
