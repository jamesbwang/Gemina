 MiRNAs regulate a variety of biological processes , such as cell proliferation and apoptosis and play critical roles in cancer progression. Accumulating studies have demonstrated that miR-1301-3p could regulate the development and progression of multiple cancers , but its biological behaviors in breast cancer ( BC) are still elusive. The expression of miR-1301-3p was determined in BC tissues and cell lines using quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The effects of miR-1301-3p on BC cell growth , proliferation , cell cycle distribution , and apoptosis were also explored in vitro using MTT , colony formation and Flow cytometry assays. The potential target gene of miR-1301-3p was determined by dual-luciferase reporter assay and verified by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis. We found the expression of miR-1301-3p was observably significantly down-regulated in BC tissues and cell lines. MiR-1301-3p expression in BC tissues was significantly associated with tumor size and clinical stage. Gain-of-function assays demonstrated that miR-1301-3p inhibited the cell growth and proliferation in breast cancer cell lines , MCF-7 and T-47D. Moreover , up-regulation of miR-1301-3p induced cell cycle G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistically , up-regulation of miR-1301-3p reduced the expression of CDK4 , Cyclin D1 , Bcl-2 , but elevated the expression of p21 , Bad and Bax. ICT1 was confirmed as a direct target of miR-1301-3p. Furthermore , ICT1 overexpression could partially reverse the effects of miR-1301-3p on BC cell proliferation , cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Our observations suggested that miR-1301-3p inhibits cell proliferation via inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through targeting ICT1 , and might be a therapeutic target for BC.
