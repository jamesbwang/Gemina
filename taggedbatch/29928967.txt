 Inhibition of poly ( ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 ( PARP1) is one of the most promising strategies for cancer chemotherapy , and a number of inhibitors possessing nicotinamide-like structures are being developed. To discover new types of PARP1 inhibitors , we screened a large number of substances of plant origin and isolated two inhibitory substances from the leaves of Syzygium samarangense ( Blume -RRB- Merrill & L.M. Perry. The inhibitory substances were identified as vescalagin and its epimer castalagin by analyses using nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. The IC
