 An enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of depression<symptom> would facilitate the discovery of new efficacious medications. To this end , we examined hippocampal transcriptional changes in rat models of disease and in humans to identify common disease signatures by using a new algorithm for signature-based clustering of expression profiles. The tool identified a transcriptomic signature comprising 70 probesets able to discriminate depression<symptom> models from controls in both Flinders Sensitive Line and Learned Helplessness animals. To identify disease-relevant pathways , we constructed an expanded protein network based on signature gene products and performed functional annotation analysis. We applied the same workflow to transcriptomic profiles of depressed patients. Remarkably , a 171-probesets transcriptional signature which discriminated depressed from healthy subjects was identified. Rat and human signatures shared the SCARA5 gene , while the respective networks derived from protein-based significant interactions with signature genes contained 25 overlapping genes. The comparison between the most enriched pathways in the rat and human signature networks identified a highly significant overlap ( p-value: 3.85 Ã— 10
