 To evaluate the signs and symptoms of dry<symptom> eye after phacoemulsification; effects on the status of ocular surface using impression cytology; and associated risk factors. Prospective study included 50 eyes ( 50 patients) with no dry<symptom> eye signs or symptoms , who underwent clear corneal phacoemulsification for senile cataract. Dry<symptom> eye indices used included Ocular Surface Disease Index scoring , Schirmer I test , tear break up time , tear meniscus height , corneal fluorescein staining , lissamine green staining and goblet cell density ( GCD) with the help of impression cytology. Primary outcome measures included post-operative changes in the dry<symptom> eye indices. Secondary outcome measures included correlation of the dry<symptom> eye signs and symptoms with various risk factors. Aggravation of both the signs and symptoms of dry<symptom> eye were noted in immediate post-operative period. The sharp deterioration was followed by a recovering trend towards the end of sixth week. A decrease in GCD was also noted. Risk factors for deterioration include age , duration of exposure to microscope light and effective phacoemulsification time. Diabetic status , socio-economic status and site of incision did not have any effect on dry<symptom> eye status. There is a transient deterioration of `` dry<symptom> eye '' status post-phacoemulsification. The patients should be carefully counselled about the evanescent nature of the disease. Incision can be given at the site of high corneal curvature to neutralize astigmatism without any fear of inducing dry<symptom> eye. Minimum light exposure and ultrasound energy should be used during the surgery.
