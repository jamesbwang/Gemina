 Transient infantile hypertriglyceridemia ( HTGTI) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 ( GPD1) gene. We report a case of HTGTI in a Chinese female infant. She presented with hepatomegaly , hypertriglyceridemia , moderately elevated transaminases , and hepatic steatosis at 3.5 months of age. A novel mutation c. 523C > T , p. ( Q175 *) was identified in GPD1. The patient was a homozygote and her parents were heterozygous for the mutation. Ultrastructural study showed intrahepatocytic lipid droplets. This is the first reported case of HTGTI in Chinese , expanding the worldwide distribution of HTGTI and the mutation spectrum of GPD1.
