 Pneumonia<disease> is the third leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age worldwide. In pediatrics , both the accuracy and safety of diagnostic tools are important. Lung ultrasound ( LUS) could be a safe diagnostic tool for this reason. We searched in the literature for diagnostic studies about LUS to predict pneumonia<disease> in pediatric patients using systematic review and meta-analysis. The Medline , CINAHL , Cochrane Library , Embase , SPORTDiscus , ScienceDirect , and Web of Science databases from inception to September 2017 were searched. All studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of LUS in determining the presence of pneumonia<disease> in patients under 18 years of age were included. 1042 articles were found by systematic search. 76 articles were assessed for eligibility. Seventeen studies were included in the systematic review. We included 2612 pooled cases. The age of the pooled sample population ranged from 0 to about 21 years old. Summary sensitivity , specificity , and AUC were 0.94 ( IQR: 0.89-0.97) , 0.93 ( IQR: 0.86-0.98) , and 0.98 ( IQR: 0.94-0.99) , respectively. No agreement on reference standard was detected: nine studies used chest X-rays , while four studies considered the clinical diagnosis. Only one study used computed tomography. LUS seems to be a promise tool for diagnosing pneumonia<disease> in children. However , the high heterogeneity found across the individual studies , and the absence of a reliable reference standard , make the finding questionable. More methodologically rigorous studies are needed.
