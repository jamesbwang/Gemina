 Tannins are polyphenolic compounds extensively present in plants and used by food industry as processing aids. Due to the heterogeneity of plant sources , actions involved in food processing and tannin commercial costs can be different. In the last years different approaches aimed at correctly identifying the tannin botanical origin have been developed , in order to satisfy the industry 's request to verify product labels. This work aimed to define the glycosidic simple phenolic profile of a large selection of monovarietal commercial tannins of different origin , using a high-resolution untargeted approach. Using accurate mass , isotopic pattern and MS/MS fragmentation , 167 precursors , 89 as monoglycosylated and 78 as diglycosylated derivatives were tentatively identified in tannins , validating the untargeted approach with 3 custom-synthesized glycosidic precursors. Almost all tannin botanical varieties were shown to be characterised by a specific glycosylated phenolic profile , providing possible tools for tannin classification in the case of glycosylphenol standard availability.
