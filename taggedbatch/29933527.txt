 Flavivirus<pathogen> replication is intimately involved with remodelled membrane organelles that are compartmentalised for different functions during their life cycle. Recent advances in lipid analyses and gene depletion have identified a number of host components that enable efficient virus replication in infected cells. Here , we describe the current understanding on the role and contribution of host lipids and membrane bending proteins to flavivirus<pathogen> replication , with a particular focus on the components that bend and shape the membrane bilayer to induce the flavivirus-induced organelles characteristic of infection.
