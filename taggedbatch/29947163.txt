 Uncontrolled donation after circulatory death ( uDCD) increases organ availability for kidney transplantation ( KT) with short-term outcomes similar to those obtained from donation after brain death ( DBD) donors. However , heterogeneous results in the long term have been reported. We compared 10-year outcomes between 237 KT recipients from uDCD donors maintained by normothermic extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( nECMO) and 237 patients undergoing KT from standard criteria DBD donors during the same period at our institution. We further analyzed risk factors for death-censored graft survival in the uDCD group. Delayed graft function ( DGF) was more common in the uDCD group ( 73.4 % versus 46.4 %; P-value < 0.01) , although glomerular filtration rate at the end of follow-up was similar in both groups. uDCD and DBD groups had similar 10-year death-censored graft ( 82.1 % versus 80.4 %; P-value = 0.623) and recipient survival ( 86.2 % versus 87.6 %; P-value = 0.454). Donor age > 50 years was associated with graft loss in the uDCD group ( hazard ratio: 1.91; P-value = 0.058) , whereas the occurrence of DGF showed no significant effect. uDCD KT under nECMO support resulted in similar graft function and long-term outcomes compared with KT from standard criteria DBD donors. Increased donor age could negatively impact graft survival after uDCD donation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
