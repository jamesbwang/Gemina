 The molecular underpinnings behind malignant progression of breast cancer from a localized lesion<symptom> to an invasive and ultimately metastatic disease are incompletely understood. Here we report that F-box only protein 22 ( FBXO22) plays a dual role in mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis. FBXO22 was upregulated in primary breast tumors and promoted cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro and xenograft tumorigenicity in vivo. Surprisingly , FBXO22 suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) , cell motility , and invasiveness in vitro and metastatic lung colonization in vivo. Clinical data showed that expression levels of FBXO22 were associated with favorable clinical outcomes , supporting the notion that metastasis , rather than primary cancer , is the major determinant of the mortality of breast cancer patients. Mechanistic investigations further revealed that FBXO22 elicits its antimetastatic effects by targeting SNAIL , a master regulator of EMT and breast cancer metastasis , for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation in a glycogen synthase kinase 3β ( GSK3β) phosphorylation-dependent manner. Importantly , expression of SNAIL rescued FBXO22-mediated suppression of EMT , cell migration , and invasion. A patient-derived tryptophan-to-arginine mutation at residue 52 ( W52R) within the F-box domain impaired FBXO22 binding to the SKP1-Cullin1 complex and blocked FBXO22-mediated SNAIL degradation , thus abrogating the ability of FBXO22 to suppress cell migration , invasion , and metastasis. Collectively , these findings uncover an unexpected dual role for FBXO22 in mammary tumorigenesis and metastatic progression and delineate the mechanism of an oncogenic mutation of FBXO22 in breast cancer progression.
