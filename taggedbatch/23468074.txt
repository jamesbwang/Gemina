 We compared skeletal microarchitecture using trabecular bone score ( TBS) and evaluated relationships between change in TBS and lumbar spine ( LS) bone mineral density ( BMD) in women with and without HIV<pathogen>. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was performed on 319 women with HIV<pathogen> and 118 without HIV<pathogen> in the Women 's Interagency HIV<pathogen> Study at baseline and 2 and 5 years , to measure regional BMD and lean and fat mass. TBS was extracted from LS dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry images and examined continuously and categorically ( normal ( ≥ 1.35) , intermediate ( 1.20-1.35) , or degraded ( ≤ 1.20) microarchitecture). Pearson correlation and linear regression examined associations of TBS with regional BMD at baseline and over time. Women with HIV<pathogen> were older ( 43 vs. 37 years) , more likely to be postmenopausal ( 27 % vs. 4 %) , have lower baseline total fat mass , trunk fat , and leg fat than uninfected women , degraded microarchitecture ( 27 % vs. 9 % , P = 0.001) , and lower baseline mean TBS ( 1.3 ± 0.1 vs. 1.4 ± 0.1 , P < 0.001). After adjusting for age , race , menopause status , and body mass index , TBS remained lower in women with HIV<pathogen> ( P < 0.0001). Annual change in TBS correlated with LS BMD change among women with HIV<pathogen> ( r = 0.36 , P < 0.0001) and without HIV<pathogen> ( r = 0.26 , P = 0.02); however , mean % annual TBS change did not differ by HIV<pathogen> status ( -1.0 %/ yr ± 2.9 % for HIV<pathogen> + vs. -0.8 %/ yr ± 1.7 % for HIV<pathogen>- , P = 0.42). Women with HIV<pathogen> have worse bone microarchitecture than uninfected women , but annual percent change in LS BMD or TBS was similar. Use of TBS as an adjunct to BMD to improve prediction of fragility fractures in women with HIV<pathogen> merits further study.
