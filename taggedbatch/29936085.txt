 We used multicenter international data from the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation Mechanically Assisted Circulation Support ( IMACS) registry to determine bloodstream infection ( BSI) event rate , independent risk factors , and association with mortality. Included were patients registered in IMACS from January 2013 through December 2015 , assessed BSI event rate of mechanical circulatory support ( MCS) and non-MCS-related BSIs , and conducted univariate and multivariate analyses between BSI with baseline characteristics and mortality. We documented 1,606 BSIs in 1,231 of 10,171 MCS recipients ( 12 %) , with an event rate of 2.43 BSIs/100 patient-months within 3 months after implant ( early onset) and 1.03 BSIs/100 patient-months after 3 months ( late onset). Of these episodes , 1,378 ( 85.8 %) were non- MCS-related BSI. Increasing body mass index and bilirubin were independent correlates of MCS-related BSI. Independent correlates of non-MCS-related BSI included older age , higher body mass index , previous cardiac surgery , baseline chronic renal disease and dialysis , pre-implant frailty , presence of biventricular assist device , total artificial heart or right ventricular assist device , and Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support category 1. Survival after 3 months after implant of patients who developed early-onset BSI was 56.9 % at 24 months vs 77.4 % in patients without early-onset BSI ( p < 0.001). Early-onset BSI was an independent correlate of mortality at 3 months after implantation ( hazard ratio , 2.56; 95 % confidence interval , 2.09-3.15; p < 0.001). Early-onset BSI was associated with significantly increased 24-month mortality. More than 85 % of these BSIs were not device related. There is an opportunity for infection prevention practices to decrease the BSI event rate , which may affect 24-month survival. These data can also serve as benchmarking for individual institutions.
