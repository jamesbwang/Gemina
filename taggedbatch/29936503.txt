 The aim of this report is to describe a case of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> and shock<symptom> precipitated by deliberate self-poisoning with theophylline. An 85-year-old male with severe theophylline intoxication in a suicide attempt was admitted with severe cardiac arrhythmia and shock<symptom>; despite poor prognosis , he fully recovered gradually after proper diagnosis and treatment. Theophylline is a rather forgotten medication; thus , intoxication is not usually considered among the etiologies of potentially treatable cardiologic emergencies , especially when its use is intentionally concealed. This case highlights the importance of identifying a comprehensive medication history using all available sources of information as early as possible in an emergency department presentation.
