 Lead ( Pb) is a widespread heavy metal that can cause damage to the ecosystem , and the ubiquitously existing dissolved organic matter ( DOM) can significantly affect the environmental behavior of Pb. The present work explores the interaction process of Pb with humic acid ( HA) through integration of synchronous fluorescence and log-transformed UV-vis absorption spectroscopy coupled with spectral slope calculation and two-dimensional correlation analyses. The spectral slope calculation results show that the carboxylic and phenolic groups in HA were the predominant binding sites to Pb , and the interaction process was highly dependent on solution pH. Correlation analyses confirmed a superior binding affinity of carboxylic groups in HA over phenolic groups. Integration of spectral slope calculation with two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy is a promising tool for better understanding the molecular structure of Pb-DOM complexes and the characteristics of Pb binding to DOM , which may provide new insights into the prevention , control , and remediation of Pb contamination in environment.
