 Small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs) are an attractive new agent with potential as a therapeutic tool because of its ability to inhibit specific genes for many conditions , including viral<disease> infections<disease> and cancers. However , despite this potential , many challenges remain , including off-target effects , difficulties with delivery , immune responses , and toxicity. Traditional genetic vectors do not guarantee that siRNAs will silence genes in vivo. Rational design strategies , such as chemical modification , viral vectors , and non-viral vectors , including cationic liposomes , polymers , nanocarriers , and bioconjugated siRNAs , provide important opportunities to overcome these challenges. We summarize the results of research into vector delivery of siRNAs as a therapeutic agent from their design to clinical trials in ophthalmic diseases , cancers , respiratory<disease> diseases<disease> , and liver virus infections. Finally , we discuss the current state of siRNA delivery methods and the need for greater understanding of the requirements.
