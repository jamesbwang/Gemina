 The adsorption of purely organic chiral molecules on ferromagnetic Co thin films is studied under ultra high vacuum conditions by means of synchrotron radiation-based electron spectroscopies , namely X-ray absorption and ultraviolet photoemission. X-ray absorption reveals that enantiomers with opposite handedness ( R , R)- and ( S , S)- of two different molecules adsorb with different strength on the Co surfaces and their valence band photoemission spectra also display distinctive features. In view of the recent reports describing the chiral-induced spin selectivity ( CISS) effect these results lead us to consider the possibility that some enantiosensitivity may appear when bonding chiral molecules to a substrate with an initial asymmetry in the population of the different spin orientations.
