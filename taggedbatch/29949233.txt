To do so , descriptive statistics as well as inferential statistics were used including the independent-sample T-test , repeated-measure one-way ANOVA as well as paired-sample T-test. The present findings revealed a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms of immediate post-test results including perceived sensitivity , severity , benefits , barriers and self-efficacy along with awareness and performance constructs ( p˂ .001). Moreover , two months after the intervention , except for the perceived sensitivity construct ( p = .088) , the two groups diverged significantly in terms of the other constructs ( p˂ .001).
