 Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia ( FD) or Type III hyperlipoproteinemia is closely associated with the ε2ε2 genotype of the common APOE polymorphism although not all ε2 homozygotes develop FD indicating that additional factors play a role including insulin resistance ( IR). The current study was undertaken to explore relationships and influences among factors , especially IR , that might elucidate FD progression pathways. Bayesian network ( BN) modeling , a probabilistic graphical exploratory data analysis tool that portrays relationships and influences among variables as simple diagrams , was applied to 52 e2e2 subjects. An algorithm based on apolipoprotein and lipid values identified 24 subjects having FD. BN modeling parameters included plasma apoE , HDL cholesterol ( HDL-C) , apolipoprotein A-I ( apoA-I) , apolipoprotein A-II ( apoA-II) , apoA-I/HDL-C ratio , apoA-II/HDL-C ratio , insulin , and Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance ( HOMA-IR). Modeling resulted in twenty network graphs. Each graph revealed apoE and the apoA-II/HDL-C ratio as sole determinants of FD prevalence. BN results did not demonstrate a direct role for insulin and HOMA-IR. However , multiple graphs in the set did reveal indirect influence of IR on FD prevalence as conveyed through the apoA-II/HDL-C ratio; while all remaining graphs in the set demonstrated the apoA-II/HDL-C ratio as directly influencing insulin levels and HOMA-IR. For apoE , the other determinant of FD prevalence , results revealed no relationship with IR parameters. In so far as insulin levels and HOMA-IR are associated with IR in e2e2 subjects , IR may act indirectly in FD progression via the apoA-II/HDL-C ratio; and/or the apoA-II/HDL-C ratio acts directly to promote IR.
