 In the context of the Belgian mental health care reform ( project 107) , 2b-teams provide care to people with a serious mental illness ( smi) , a population encountering regular somatic comorbidity and limited compliance with medication. Team composition and care provided by these teams is rather unclear. <br /> AIM: To consider the team composition and to focus on the nurses ' role within Flemish 2b-teams. Also , seen from different disciplines involved , to determine the desired future nursing role. <br /> METHOD: A structured interview was used to discover team characteristics and fidelity to the flexible assertive community treatment ( fact) model in 12 Flemish 2b-teams. With a digital survey containing 16 questions we explored the actual and desired nursing care , according to 151 nurses and medical physicians. <br /> RESULTS: Despite the difference in team size and composition , it was not found to be significant. Flemish team 's fact model-fidelity was average. Actual care was restricted to psychosocial interventions. Regarding desired care , significant differences were found between physicians and nurses. Caregivers within outreach teams scored items significantly higher on desired care compared to actual care. <br /> CONCLUSION: We conclude that the team composition of Flemish 2b-team varies , with an average fact model fidelity. Team care is restricted to psychosocial interventions , while more somatic and nursing care is desired.
