 This study used data from the Czech Myeloma Group Registry of Monoclonal Gammopathies to validate the International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG) and revised International Staging System ( R-ISS) indices for risk stratification in patients with multiple myeloma ( MM) in clinical practice. Patients were included if they had symptomatic MM , complete data allowing R-ISS and IMWG staging ( including cytogenetic information regarding t ( 4; 14) , t ( 14; 16) , and del ( 17p)) , and key parameters for treatment evaluation. Median overall survival ( OS) in included patients ( n = 550) was 47.7 ( 95 % CI: 39.5-55.9) and 46.2 ( 95 % CI: 38.9-53.5) months from diagnosis and initiation of first-line therapy , respectively. Patients categorized as higher vs lower risk had reduced survival; median OS from diagnosis was 35.4 ( 95 % CI: 30.5-40.3) vs 58.3 ( 95 % CI: 53.8-62.9) months in high-risk vs other patients ( IMWG; P = .001) and 34.1 ( 95 % CI: 30.2-38.0) vs 47.2 ( 95 % CI: 43.4-51.0) months in Stage III vs Stage II patients ( R-ISS; P < .001). In conclusion , IMWG and R-ISS risk stratification indices are applicable to patients with MM in a real-world setting.
