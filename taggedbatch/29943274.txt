 We have been developing quick and simple system for detecting food-poisoning bacteria using a combination of an asymmetric PCR and a portable surface plasmon resonance ( SPR) sensor. The system would be suitable for point-of-care detection of food-poisoning bacteria in the field of food industry. In this study , we established a novel method for quantifying the amplified forward ( F) and reverse ( R) chains of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> separately by high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC). The concentration of single-stranded DNA amplicon excessively amplified , which is crucial for the system , could be calculated as the difference between those of the F- and R-chains. For the R-chain , a correction based on the F-chain concentration in the sample was used to obtain a more accurate value , because the determination of the R-chain concentration was affected by that of the coexisting F-chain. The concentration values were also determined by fluorescence imaging for electrophoresis gels of amplicons with FITC- or Cy5-conjugated primers , and they were in good agreement with the values by the HPLC. The measured concentration of the single-strand F-chain correlated well with the value of the SPR response against the probe that was a complementary sequence of the F-chain , immobilized on the sensor chip of the SPR sensor.
