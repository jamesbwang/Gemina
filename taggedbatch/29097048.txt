 The Charting Outcomes resource is useful in gauging an applicant 's competiveness for a given specialty. However , many variables are not reported in Charting Outcomes that may influence an applicant 's ability to match. A significant proportion of applicants record their experiences in an anonymous , self-reported applicant spreadsheet. We analyzed factors associated with a successful match using this dataset to test the hypothesis that research productivity and high academic performance correlates with success rates. A retrospective analysis of `` RadOnc Interview Spreadsheet '' for the 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 radiation oncology match was performed. Data were accessed via studentdoctor.net. Board scores , research characteristics , Sub-I participation , and interview invitation rates were available. Mann-Whitney U , Kruskal-Wallis , and chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis. When possible , results were compared to those reported in the National Residency Match Program 's `` Charting Outcomes '' report. A total of 158 applicants were examined for the applicant characteristics. Applicants applied to a median of 61 programs and received a median of 14 interviews. The mean step 1 score was 248 ( range: 198 to 272) and most were in the highest grade point average quartile ( 68.3 %). 21.7 % participated in additional research year ( s) , and 19 % obtained a PhD. The majority of applicants took three radiation oncology electives ( 48.7 %). On multivariate analysis , alpha-omega-alpha ( AOA) honors society status ( p = 0.033) , participating in a research year ( p = 0.001) and number of journal publications ( p = 0.047) significantly correlated with higher interview invitation rates. In summary , this study identifies important considerations for radiation oncology applicants that have not been previously reported , such as induction into AOA and number of journal publications.
