 Spinal<disease> cord injury ( SCI) results in lesions<symptom> that destroy tissue and disrupt spinal tracts , producing deficits in locomotor and autonomic function. The majority of treatment strategies after SCI have concentrated on the damaged spinal<disease> cord , for example working to reduce lesion<symptom> size or spread , or encouraging regrowth of severed descending axonal projections through the lesion<symptom> , hoping to re-establish synaptic connectivity with caudal targets. In our work , we have focused on a novel target for treatment after SCI , surviving spinal motoneurons and their target musculature , with the hope of developing effective treatments to preserve or restore lost function following SCI. We previously demonstrated that motoneurons , and the muscles they innervate , show pronounced atrophy after SCI. Importantly , SCI-induced atrophy of motoneuron dendrites can be attenuated by treatment with gonadal hormones , testosterone and its active metabolites , estradiol and dihydrotestosterone. Similarly , SCI-induced reductions in muscle fiber cross-sectional areas can be prevented by treatment with androgens. Together , these findings suggest that regressive changes in motoneuron and muscle morphology seen after SCI can be ameliorated by treatment with gonadal hormones , further supporting a role for steroid hormones as neurotherapeutic agents in the injured nervous system.
