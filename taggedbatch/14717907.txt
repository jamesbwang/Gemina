 Alport syndrome<disease><symptom> is an X-linked syndrome<disease><symptom> that results in nephritis , renal<symptom> failure<symptom> , sensorineural hearing loss , and eye deficits. As a result of sensorineural hearing loss , these individuals are likely to experience difficulties in the area of speech and language. While studies in the past have examined the speech and language characteristics of children with syndromic sensorineural hearing loss , to our knowledge there are no previous studies to have documented the speech and language characteristics of these children on a long-term basis. The current study addresses this limitation by reporting speech , language , hearing , and function of twin brothers with X-linked Alport syndrome<disease><symptom> across a seven-year period. Information was collected by examining the medical records of the participants as well as through a verbal interview with the participants ' guardian. Results revealed that the participants ' hearing abilities gradually deteriorated over the seven-year period which affected their speech and language development as well. The kidney function tests revealed significant presence of hematuria<symptom> ( blood in the urine) as well as proteinuria<symptom> ( protein in the urine) suggesting chronic kidney dysfunction. This longitudinal study demonstrates the functional relationship between the kidneys and the cochlea , although they appear to be independent of one another. As individuals with Alport syndrome<disease><symptom> exhibit systemic complications , interdisciplinary collaboration is essential among health care providers including audiologists , speech-language pathologists , nephrologists , and ophthalmologist to promote evidence-based practice.
