 This study was designed to investigate the gut microbiota of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The inclusive and exclusive criteria for NAFLD patients and healthy subjects were formulated , and detailed clinical data were collected. The genomic DNA of stool<symptom> samples were extracted for 16S rDNA sequencing , and the amplified V4-region was sequenced on the Illumina Miseq platform. Metastats analysis was performed to identify the differential taxa between the groups. Redundancy analysis was used to evaluate the association between gut microbial structure and clinical variables. Thirty NAFLD patients and 37 healthy controls were involved. The 16S rDNA sequencing showed that there was a dramatic variability of the fecal microbiota among all the individuals. Metastats analysis identified eight families and 12 genera with significant differences between the two groups. When some clinical parameters , such as waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR) , were enrolled in Redundancy analysis , the distribution of the two group of samples was obviously changed. The compositional shifts in fecal bacterial communities of NAFLD patients from the healthy controls were mainly at family or genus levels. According to our Redundancy analysis , insulin resistance and obesity might be closely related to both NAFLD phenotype and intestinal microecology.
