 In the context of the current opioid epidemic , there has been a renewed interest in the use of ketamine as an analgesic agent. We have reviewed ketamine analgesia. Ketamine is well-known as an antagonist for N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. In addition , it can regulate the function of opioid receptors and sodium channels. Ketamine also increases signaling through Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors. These myriad of molecular and cellular mechanisms are responsible for a number of pharmacological functions including pain relief and mood regulation. Clinically , a number of studies have investigated the role of ketamine in the setting of acute and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , and there is evidence that ketamine can provide analgesia in a variety of pain syndromes<disease><symptom>. In this review , we have examined basic mechanisms of ketamine and its current clinical use as well as potential novel use in pain management.
