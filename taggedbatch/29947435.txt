 Cysteine-based native chemical ligation ( NCL) has been a very powerful approach for convergent synthesis of peptides and proteins. However , owing to the low abundance of cysteine ( Cys) in proteins , applications of NCL in protein chemical synthesis are limited. To expand the peptide ligation toolbox , NCL followed by desulfurization has been developed to enable peptide ligation at Xaa-Ala conjunctions- formal `` alanine ligation ''. In this regard , effective peptide desulfurization methods are critical. This concept article summarizes the development of different desulfurization strategies for peptide and protein chemical synthesis.
