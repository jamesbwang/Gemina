 We develop magnetic cytoskeleton affinity ( MiCA) purification , which allows for rapid isolation of molecular motors<symptom> conjugated to large multivalent quantum dots , in miniscule quantities , which is especially useful for single-molecule applications. When purifying labeled molecular motors<symptom> , an excess of fluorophores or labels is usually used. However , large labels tend to sediment during the centrifugation step of microtubule affinity purification , a traditionally powerful technique for motor purification. This is solved with MiCA , and purification time is cut from 2 h to 20 min , a significant time-savings when it needs to be done daily. For kinesin , MiCA works with as little as 0.6 μg protein , with yield of ∼ 27 % , compared to 41 % with traditional purification. We show the utility of MiCA purification in a force-gliding assay with kinesin , allowing , for the first time , simultaneous determination of whether the force from each motor in a multiple-motor system drives or hinders microtubule movement. Furthermore , we demonstrate rapid purification of just 30 ng dynein-dynactin-BICD2N-QD ( DDB-QD) , ordinarily a difficult protein-complex to purify.
