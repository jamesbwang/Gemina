 Malignant craniopharyngioma or anaplastic craniopharyngioma was first reported in 1987 by Akachi. It has a malignant clinical and histological feature; remarkably rapid progression , atypical pathology like squamous cell carcinoma and poor prognosis. To date seventeen cases of malignant craniopharyngioma have been reported and of these cases , most were of secondary malignant tumor in nature. With respect to traditional benign craniopharyngioma , adjunctive treatment after gross total removal is not necessary , but in the case of malignant types of the tumor , adjunctive treatment is important. This paper presents the first case of malignant craniopharyngioma reactive to adjunctive Gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery and chemotherapy. Malignant craniopharyngioma is very rare , and we report Gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery and chemotherapy ( Carboplatine and etoposide chemotherapy) , as well as Temozolomide chemotherapy were effective and could control progression of the tumor temporarily. Since adjunctive Gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery and chemotherapy of malignant craniopharyngioma cases affects follow-up strategies , we propose supporting the need to a revision to the WHO classification regarding malignancy evaluation of craniopharyngioma.
