 Cold atmospheric plasma ( CAP) represents a promising therapy for selectively cancer killing. However , the mechanism of CAP-induced cancer cell death remains unclear. Here , we identified the tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- family members , especially Fas , and overloaded intracellular nitric oxide ( NO) participated in CAP induced apoptosis in A375 and A875 melanoma cell lines , which was known as extrinsic apoptosis pathway. This progress was mediated by antagonistic protein of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , Sestrin2. The over expression of Sestrin2 induced by plasma treatment resulted in phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) , followed by increased expression of nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS) , Fas and Fas ligand. Depletion of Sestrin2 reduced iNOS and Fas expression , which was associated with reduction of plasma-induced apoptosis. In contrast , inhibition of iNOS activity and phosphorylation of p38 did not alter Sestrin2 expression in plasma-treated melanoma cells. Taken together , cold atmospheric plasma increases Sestrin2 expression and further activates downstream iNOS , Fas and p38 MAPK signaling to induce apoptosis of melanoma cell lines. These findings suggest a previously unrecognized mechanism in melanoma cells response to cold atmospheric plasma therapy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
