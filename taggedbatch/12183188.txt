 To evaluate the serum level of the local anesthetic mepivacaine 3 % without vasoconstrictor in patients who underwent procedures performed in the anterior and posterior maxilla , through a method of possible extraction to quantify it in human plasma by high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC). This was a hybrid study consisting of 18 patients ( 7 females and 11 males) classified as ASA I , adults and with normal body mass index , submitted to procedures in the anterior region ( group I) and posterior region of the maxilla ( group II). For 40 minutes , five 6 ml blood samples were collected every 10 minutes after infiltrative injection in each region of the maxilla. Serum levels of the drug were obtained through HPLC. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) and heart rate ( HR) were measured throughout the procedure. When compared to the general average of the concentrations of each group , significant values ( p < 0.05) with greater absorption were observed for the anterior region of the maxilla ( group I). There was no significant difference when comparing blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) and heart rate ( HR) values. The concentrations found are safe for infiltrative anesthesia in the analyzed patients , there was a higher plasma level of the local anesthetic in the anterior region of the maxilla and there was no change in HR and BP in relation to the anesthetized area.
