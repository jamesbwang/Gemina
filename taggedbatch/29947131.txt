 Oscillatory activity is crucial for information processing in the brain , and has a long history as a biomarker for psychopathology. Variation in oscillatory activity is highly heritable , but current understanding of specific genetic influences remains limited. We performed the largest genome-wide association study to date of oscillatory power during eyes-closed resting electroencephalogram ( EEG) across a range of frequencies ( delta 1-3.75 Hz , theta 4-7.75 Hz , alpha 8-12.75 Hz , and beta 13-30 Hz) in 8,425 subjects. Additionally , we performed KGG positional gene-based analysis and brain-expression analyses. GABRA2-a known genetic marker for alcohol use disorder and epilepsy-significantly affected beta power , consistent with the known relation between GABA
