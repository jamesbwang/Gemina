 Penile carcinoma ( PC) is a rare , highly mutilating disease , common in developing countries. The evolution of penile cancer includes at least two independent carcinogenic pathways , related or unrelated to HPV infection. To estimate the prevalence , identify HPV genotypes , and correlate with clinicopathological data on penile cancer. A retrospective cohort study involving 183 patients with PC undergoing treatment in a referral hospital in Goiânia , Goiás , in Midwestern Brazil , from 2003 to 2015. Samples containing paraffin embedded tumor fragments were subjected to detection and genotyping by INNO-LiPA HPV. The clinicopathological variables were subjected to analysis with respect to HPV positivity and used prevalence ratio ( PR) , adjusted prevalence ratio ( PRa) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI) as statistical measures. The prevalence of HPV DNA in PC was 30.6 % ( 95 % CI: 24.4 to 37.6) , high-risk HPV 24.9 % ( 95 % CI: 18.9 to 31.3) , and 62.5 % were HPV 16. There was a statistical association between the endpoints HPV infection and HPV high risk , and the variable tumor grade II-III ( p = 0.025) ( p = 0.040) , respectively. There was no statistical difference in disease specific survival at 10 years between the HPV positive and negative patients ( p = 0.143) , and high and low risk HPV ( p = 0.325). The prevalence of HPV infection was 30.6 % , and 80.3 % of the genotypes were identified as preventable by anti-HPV quadrivalent or nonavalent vaccine. HPV infections and high-risk HPV were not associated with penile carcinoma prognosis in this study.
