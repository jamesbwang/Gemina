 Animals harbor an extensive , dynamic microbial ecosystem in their gut. Gut microbiota ( GM) supposedly modulate various host functions including fecundity , metabolism , immunity , cognition and behavior. Starting by analyzing the concept of the holobiont as a unit of selection , we highlight recent findings suggesting an intimate link between GM and animal social behavior. We consider two reciprocal emerging themes: ( i) that GM influence host social behavior; and ( ii) that social behavior and social structure shape the composition of the GM across individuals. We propose that , throughout a long history of coevolution , GM may have become involved in the modulation of their host 's sociality to foster their own transmission , while in turn social organization may have fine-tuned the transmission of beneficial endosymbionts and prevented pathogen infection. We suggest that investigating these reciprocal interactions can advance our understanding of sociality , from healthy and impaired social cognition to the evolution of specific social behaviors and societal structure.
