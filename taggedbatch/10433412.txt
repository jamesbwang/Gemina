 School health services provide an excellent opportunity for the detection and treatment of children at risk of later health problems. However , the optimal use of school doctors ' skills and expertise remains unknown. Furthermore , no validated method for screening children for school doctors ' assessments exists. The aims of the study are 1) to evaluate the benefits or harm of school doctors ' routine health checks in primary school grades 1 and 5 ( at ages 7 and 11) and 2) to explore whether some of the school doctors ' routine health checks can be omitted using study questionnaires. This is a prospective , multicenter observational study conducted in four urban municipalities in Southern Finland by comparing the need for a school doctor 's assessment to the benefit gained from it. We will recruit a random sample of 1050 children from 21 schools from primary school grades 1 and 5. Before the school doctor 's health check , parents , nurses and teachers fill a study questionnaire to identify any potential concerns about each child. Doctors , blinded to the questionnaire responses , complete an electronic report after the appointment , including given instructions and follow-up plans. The child , parent , doctor and researchers assess the benefit of the health check. The researchers compare the need for a doctor 's appointment to the benefit gained from it. At one year after the health check , we will analyze the implementation of the doctors ' interventions and follow-up plans. The study will increase our knowledge of the benefits of school doctors ' routine health checks and assess the developed screening method. We hypothesize that targeting the health checks to the children in greatest need would increase the quality of school health services.
