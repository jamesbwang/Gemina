 Increasing yield is a principal goal when breeding Lentinus edodes. The detection of quantitative trait loci ( QTLs) underlying yield and its related traits , precocity and the number of fruiting bodies ( NFs) , is important in order to breed high-yield cultivars. Using composite interval mapping ( CIM) , we mapped a total of 25 QTLs responsible for precocity , NFs , and yield in 2 segregating populations of L. edodes. QTLs for the 3 traits were mapped on 5 different linkage groups , contributing 5.9 % to 15.4 % of the phenotypic variation. Colocated QTLs were also found underlying multiple traits , implying the presence of a genic pleiotropic effect or tightly linked genes. This is , to our knowledge , the first report of the genetic dissection of precocity , NFs , and yield using QTL mapping in L. edodes. Findings of this study will facilitate marker-assisted breeding of high-yield cultivars of L. edodes.
