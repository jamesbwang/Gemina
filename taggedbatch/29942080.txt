 Cysteine dioxygenase ( CDO) plays an essential role in sulfur metabolism by regulating homeostatic levels of cysteine. Human CDO contains a post-translationally generated Cys93-Tyr157 cross-linked cofactor. Here , we investigated this Cys-Tyr cross-linking by incorporating unnatural tyrosines in place of Tyr157 via a genetic method. The catalytically active variants were obtained with a thioether bond between Cys93 and the halogen-substituted Tyr157 , and we determined the crystal structures of both wild-type and engineered CDO variants in the purely uncross-linked form and with a mature cofactor. Along with mass spectrometry and
