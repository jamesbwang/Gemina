 Higher levels of total testosterone and lower levels of sex hormone-binding globulin ( SHBG) have been associated with increased blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) in women with an inverse association between total testosterone and BP among men. Fewer studies have examined associations with 24-h ambulatory blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( ABP) , blunted nocturnal BP decline or the role of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate ( DHEAS) , a precursor to androgens. Baseline blood samples were assayed for 229 normotensive men ( ≥ 50 years) and women ( ≥ 55 years) participating in the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL. Standardized seated BP ( SBP and DBP) and 24-h ABP were measured by trained technicians. Self-reported cardiovascular risk factors and sociodemographic variables were reported on baseline questionnaires. Sex stratified linear regression models adjusted for age , race/ethnicity , BMI , smoking and alcohol estimated the association between each sex hormone and measures of BP and 24-h ABP. Logistic regression used to estimate associations with blunted nocturnal decline ( > 10 % reduction in SBP or DBP during sleeping hours). Total testosterone and SHBG demonstrated significant inverse correlations with SBP whereas DHEAS was not significantly associated with BP. Among men , in multivariable analyses , each 10 % increase in DHEAS was associated with a 0.41 mmHg higher seated DBP ( β = 4.29 , 95 % CI 0.84-7.73) and each 10 % increase in total testosterone and SHBG was associated with a 0.54 mmHg ( β = -5.65 , 95 % CI -10.45 to -0.84) and 0.60 mmHg ( β = -6.30 , 95 % CI -11.38 to -1.21) decrease in seated DBP , respectively. No significant associations were observed among women. Among men only , we observed statistically significant inverse cross-sectional associations between total testosterone and SHBG with seated DBP , and a significant positive association with DHEAS levels.
