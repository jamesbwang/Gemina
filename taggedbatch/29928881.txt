 Chorea-acanthocytosis ( ChAc) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease characterized by neurodegeneration in the striatum<pathogen> and acanthocytosis caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Vacuolar Protein Sorting 13 Homolog A ( VPS13A) gene , which encodes chorein. We previously produced a ChAc-model mouse with a homozygous deletion of exons 60-61 in Vps13a , which corresponded to the human<disease> disease<disease> mutation. We found that male ChAc-model mice exhibited complete infertility<symptom> as a result of severely diminished sperm motility. Immunocytochemical study revealed that chorein-like immunoreactivity is abundant only in the midpiece , mitochondria-rich region , of the sperm of wild type mice. They showed no significant differences from wild types in terms of the adenosine 5 '- triphosphate ( ATP) concentration of their sperm , sperm count , or sexual activity. Electron microscopy revealed abnormal ultrastructural morphology of the mitochondria in the midpiece of sperm from ChAc-model mice. These results suggest that chorein is essential in mouse sperm for the maintenance of ultrastructural mitochondrial morphology and sperm motility.
