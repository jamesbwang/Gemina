 Cultural traditions have been observed in a wide variety of animal species. It remains unclear , however , what is required for social learning to give rise to stable traditions: what level of precision and what learning strategies are required. We address these questions by fitting models of cultural evolution to learned bird song. We recorded 615 swamp sparrow ( Melospiza georgiana<pathogen>) song repertoires , and compared syllable frequency distributions to the output of individual-based simulations. We find that syllables are learned with an estimated error rate of 1.85 % and with a conformist bias in learning. This bias is consistent with a simple mechanism of overproduction and selective attrition. Finally , we estimate that syllable types could frequently persist for more than 500 years. Our results demonstrate conformist bias in natural animal behaviour and show that this , along with moderately precise learning , may support traditions whose stability rivals those of humans.
