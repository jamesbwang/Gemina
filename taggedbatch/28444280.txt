 Perioperative myocardial injury ( PMI) is common in elective inpatient abdominal surgery and correlates with mortality risk. Simple measures for reducing PMI in this cohort are needed. This study evaluated whether remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC) could reduce PMI in elective inpatient abdominal surgery. This was a double-blind , sham-controlled trial with 1:1 parallel randomization. PMI was defined as any post-operative serum troponin T ( hs-TNT) > 14 ng/L. Eighty-four participants were randomized to receiving RIPC ( 5 min of upper arm ischemia followed by 5 min reperfusion , for three cycles) or a sham-treatment immediately prior to surgery. The primary outcome was mean peak post-operative troponin in patients with PMI , and secondary outcomes included mean hs-TnT at individual timepoints , post-operative hs-TnT area under the curve ( AUC) , cardiovascular events and mortality. Predictors of PMI were also collected. Follow up was to 1 year. PMI was observed in 21 % of participants. RIPC did not significantly influence the mean peak post-operative hs-TnT concentration in these patients ( RIPC 25.65 ng/L ( SD 9.33) , sham-RIPC 23.91 ( SD 13.2) , mean difference 1.73 ng/L , 95 % confidence interval- 9.7 to 13.1 ng/L , P = 0.753). The treatment did not influence any secondary outcome with the pre-determined definition of PMI. Redefining PMI as > 5 ng/L in line with recent data revealed a non-significant lower incidence in the RIPC cohort ( 68 % vs 81 % , P = 0.211) , and significantly lower early hs-TnT release ( 12 h time-point , RIPC 5.5 ng/L ( SD 5.5) vs sham 9.1 ng/L ( SD 8.2) , P = 0.03). RIPC did not at reduce the incidence or severity of PMI in these general surgical patients using pre-determined definitions. PMI is nonetheless common and effective cardioprotective strategies are required. This trial was registered with Clinicaltrials.gov , NCT01850927 , 5th July 2013.
