 and non-nociceptive sensory information. Antenna-type neurons with cell bodies located in lamina III and large dendritic trees extending from the superficial lamina I to deep lamina IV are best shaped for the integration of a wide variety of inputs arising from primary afferent fibers and intrinsic spinal circuitries. While the somatodendritic morphology , the hallmark of antenna neurons , has been well studied , little is still known about the axon structure and basic physiological properties of these cells. Here we did whole-cell recordings in a rat ( P9-P12) spinal<disease> cord preparation with attached dorsal roots to examine the axon course , intrinsic firing properties and primary afferent inputs of antenna cells. Nine antenna cells were identified from a large sample of biocytin-filled lamina III neurons ( n = 46). Axon of antenna cells showed intensive branching in laminae III-IV and , in half of the cases , issued dorsally directed collaterals reaching lamina I. Antenna cells exhibited tonic and rhythmic firing patterns; single spikes were followed by hyper- or depolarization. The neurons received monosynaptic inputs from the low-threshold Aβ afferents , Aδ afferents as well as from the high-threshold Aδ and C afferents. When selectively activated , C-fiber-driven mono- and polysynaptic EPSPs were sufficiently strong to evoke firing in the neurons. Thus , lamina III antenna neurons integrate low-threshold and nociceptive high-threshold primary afferent inputs , and can function as wide-dynamic-range neurons able to directly connect deep dorsal horn with the major nociceptive projection area lamina I.
