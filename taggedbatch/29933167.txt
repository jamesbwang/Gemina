 Exposure of aquatic organisms to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH) , such as phenanthrene ( PHE) , may increase the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) and cause changes in the biotransformation systems. In addition , changes in water temperature can cause adverse effects in the organisms. Estuarine species , like the oyster Crassostrea brasiliana , can adapt and tolerate temperature variation. To evaluate the influence of temperature on biological responses of C. brasiliana exposed to PHE , oysters were maintained at three temperatures ( 18 , 24 and 32 °C) for 15 days and co-exposed afterwards to 100 μg.L
