 Oral focal mucinosis ( OFM) is a rare soft<disease> tissue lesion<symptom> of unknown etiology that exhibits tumor-like growth. It is considered the oral counterpart of cutaneous focal mucinosis or cutaneous myxoid cyst<symptom>. This is a retrospective study of oral OFM diagnosed over a period of 42 years at an oral pathology service. Clinical , histopathological and immunohistochemical data were analyzed. Alcian blue staining and S-100 immunohistochemistry were performed. Eleven cases were retrieved ( 4:1 female-to-male ratio). The mean age was 44 years. The gingiva was the most affected site. The main clinical presentation was sessile or pedunculated lesions<symptom> of fibrous or hyperplasic appearance , most of them asymptomatic. Positive Alcian blue staining and absence of S-100 protein were observed in all specimens , which supported the histological diagnosis of OFM. Surgical excision was the treatment of choice. Although rare , this study supports the inclusion of OFM in the differential diagnosis of intraoral myxoid lesions<symptom>.
