 Three kinds of multifunctional graphene metasurfaces based on Pancharatnam ‚Åª Berry ( PB) phase cells are proposed and numerically demonstrated to control a reflected wave & rsquo; s spin angular momentum ( SAM) and orbital angular momentum ( OAM) in the terahertz ( THz) regime. Each proposed metasurface structure is composed of an array of graphene strips with different deviation angles and a back-grounded quartz substrate. In order to further help readers have a deeper insight into the graphene-based metasurfaces , a detailed design strategy is also provided. With the aid of the designed graphene elements , the proposed metasurfaces can achieve the full 360 & deg; range of phase coverage and provide manipulation of SAM and OAM of a circularly polarized ( CP) wave at will. More importantly , simultaneous control of these two momentums can also be realized , and in order to demonstrate this function , a THz spin-controlled OAM beam generator with diverse topological charges is created , which can provide one more degree of freedom to improve the channel capability without increasing the bandwidth compared to a linearly polarized ( LP) OAM beam. Numerical results verify the proposed graphene metasurfaces , which pave the way for generating spin OAM vortex waves for THz communication systems.
