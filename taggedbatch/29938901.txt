 Children with congenital heart disease are at risk for developing increased arterial stiffness and this may be modulated by physical activity. To compare arterial stiffness in high- and low-physically active children with congenital heart disease and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Seventeen children with congenital heart disease ( 12 ± 2 years; females = 9) , grouped by low- and high-physical activity levels from accelerometry step count values , and 20 matched controls ( 11 ± 3 years; females = 9) were studied. Carotid-radial pulse wave velocity was assessed with applanation tonometry to determine arterial stiffness. Body composition and 6-min walk test measures were performed. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and multiple regression. Significance was P < .05. Arterial stiffness was increased in low-physically active children with congenital heart disease ( 9.79 ± 0.97 m/s) compared to high-physically active children with congenital heart disease ( 7.88 ± 0.71 m/s; P = .002) and healthy-matched controls ( 8.67 ± 1.28 m/s; P = .015). There were no differences in body composition measures between groups ( all P > .05) , but 6-min walk test distance was less in both congenital heart disease groups ( high-physically active: 514 ± 40 m; low-physically active: 539 ± 49 m) versus controls ( 605 ± 79 m; all P < .05). Average daily step count significantly predicted arterial stiffness in children with congenital heart disease ( R Low-physically active children with congenital heart disease have increased arterial stiffness compared to high-physically active children with congenital heart disease and healthy-matched controls. Regular physical activity in children with congenital heart disease may modulate arterial stiffness.
