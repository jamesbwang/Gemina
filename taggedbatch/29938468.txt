 Background: Colorectal cancer ( CRC) is widespread across the world. While conventional anticancer treatments can help the affected patients , cells of vital organs such as the kidney , lungs , bladder and nervous system may suffer from side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs , so that it is necessary to search for alternatives. From ancient times , attention has focused on medicinal plants and natural products. In the current work , Camellia sinensis<pathogen> , whose leaves are used to produce green tea was evaluated for anticancer effects in cell culture. Materials and Methods: A hydroalcoholic extract of Camellia sinensis<pathogen> young leaves was prepared by percolation and compared with Cisplatin as a known anticancer drug for effects on two cell lines: Caco-2 , colon carcinoma cells , and mouse normal fibroblasts ( L929). Cytotoxicity of 50 , 100 , 200 , 400 and 800 μg/ml of Camellia sinensis extract was evaluated by MTT assay and aquaporin 5 ( AQP5) , detected as a biomarker for surviving cells using immunofluorescence microscopy. Results: MTT assays with hydroalcoholic extract of Camellia sinensis<pathogen> showed considerable inhibition of growth of Caco-2 cells , significant at 800 μg/ml ( P < 0.05) , with little effect on L929 cells. Levels of aquaporin 5 protein decreased in Caco-2 cell culture following green tea extract treatment. Conclusion: According to the results of the current study , Camellia sinensis<pathogen> is a medicinal plant with potent anticancer influence which might be specific.
