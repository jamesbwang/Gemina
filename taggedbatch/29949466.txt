 Nanostructured lipid carriers in-gel ( NLCs-gel) were prepared to enhance and improve the ocular delivery of dexamethasone. Materials & methods: NLCs containing dexamethasone prepared by high-pressure homogenization were characterized and dispersed into thermosensitive gels ( Pluronic F127 and F68 as gels material). In vitro drug release studies , ocular irritation tests , ex vivo corneal penetration and drug dynamics of NLCs and NLCs-gel were evaluated in aqueous humor. NLCs-gel exhibited a rapid sol-gel transition at 34.4 Â°C and presented nano-sized , narrowly distributed particles. Corneal penetration studies revealed steady sustained drug release ( Ritger-Peppas); NLCs-gel increased ocular bioavailability by prolonging precorneal retention time and improving corneal permeation. These findings suggest developing NLCs-gel for potential treatment of posterior segment eye diseases.
