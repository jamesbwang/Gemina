 At present , we have no evidence that we are doing more good than harm detecting and subsequently treating Mycoplasma<pathogen> hominis<pathogen> , Ureaplasma<pathogen> parvum<pathogen> and Ureaplasma<pathogen> urealyticum<pathogen> colonizations/infections. Consequently , routine testing and treatment of asymptomatic or symptomatic men and women for M.<pathogen> hominis<pathogen> , U.<pathogen> urealyticum<pathogen> and U.<pathogen> parvum<pathogen> are not recommended. Asymptomatic carriage of these bacteria is common , and the majority of individuals do not develop any disease. Although U.<pathogen> urealyticum<pathogen> has been associated with urethritis<disease> in men , it is probably not causal unless a high load is present ( likely carriage in 40-80 % of detected cases). The extensive testing , detection and subsequent antimicrobial treatment of these bacteria performed in some settings may result in the selection of antimicrobial resistance , in these bacteria , ` true ' STI agents , as well as in the general microbiota , and substantial economic cost for society and individuals , particularly women. The commercialization of many particularly multiplex PCR assays detecting traditional non-viral STIs together with M.<pathogen> hominis<pathogen> , U.<pathogen> parvum and/or U.<pathogen> urealyticum<pathogen> has worsened this situation. Thus , routine screening of asymptomatic men and women or routine testing of symptomatic individuals for M.<pathogen> hominis<pathogen> , U.<pathogen> urealyticum<pathogen> and U.<pathogen> parvum<pathogen> is not recommended. If testing of men with symptomatic urethritis<disease> is undertaken , traditional STI urethritis<disease> agents such as Neisseria<pathogen> gonorrhoeae<pathogen> , Chlamydia<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> , M.<pathogen> genitalium<pathogen> and , in settings where relevant , Trichomonas vaginalis<pathogen> should be excluded prior to U.<pathogen> urealyticum testing and quantitative species-specific molecular diagnostic tests should be used. Only men with high U.<pathogen> urealyticum<pathogen> load should be considered for treatment; however , appropriate evidence for effective treatment regimens is lacking. In symptomatic women , bacterial<disease> vaginosis<disease> ( BV) should always be tested for and treated if detected.
