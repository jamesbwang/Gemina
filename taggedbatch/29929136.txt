 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) have become ubiquitous in the aquatic environment. Some PAHs are mutagenic , potentially causing germline mutations in fish that inhabit PAH contaminated waters. We evaluated the effect of exposure to sediment-borne PAHs on reproduction and germline mutation rates in fathead minnows ( Pimephales promelas). Exposure to the contaminated sediment had no significant impact on the reproductive endpoints measured in this study. Germline mutations rates at three microsatellite DNA loci were 1.69 Ã— 10
