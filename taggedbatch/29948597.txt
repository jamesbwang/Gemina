 To investigate the effects of ethanol extract of Patrinia scabiosaefolia ( EEPS) on chemo-resistance of colorectal cancer cells ( CRC) and explore the possible molecular mechanisms. 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU)- resistant human colorectal carcinoma cell line ( HCT-8/ 5-FU) and its parental cells HCT-8 were treated with EEPS ( 0 , 0.25 , 0.50 , 1 or 2 mg/mL) , or 5-FU ( 0 , 100 , 200 , 400 , 800 or 1600 Î¼mol/L). The 3- ( 4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2 , 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT) assay was performed to evaluate the cell viability. Cell density was observed by phase-contrast microscope , cell counting and colony formation assay were used to determine the cell proliferation of HCT-8/ 5-FU cells treated with 0 , 0.5 , 1 or 2 mg/mL EEPS. Cell apoptosis was determined by Hoechst staining. Western-blot was performed to detect the phosphorylation of AKT as well as the protein expression level of B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 ( Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein ( Bax). Compared with HCT-8 cells , MTT assay results indicated that HCT-8/ 5-FU cells were resistant to 5-FU treatment ( P < 0.05) , and sensitive to EEPS treatment ( P > 0.05). Moreover , compared with untreated HCT-8/ 5-FU cells , 1 and 2 mg/mL of EEPS treatment significantly reduced cell density , cell number , inhibited cell survival ( P < 0.05) , and induced apoptosis in HCT-8/ 5-FU cells. Furthermore , 1 and 2 mg/mL of EEPS significantly decreased the phosphorylation level of p-AKT and Bcl-2 protein expression , and increased the expression of Bax protein ( P < 0.05). EEPS is a promising therapeutic agent that may overcome chemo-resistance in cancer cells , likely through suppression of the AKT pathway and promotion of cancer cell apoptosis.
