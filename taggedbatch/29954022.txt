 The subciliary and skin pinch approaches are the most widely accepted techniques for treating dermatochalasis of the lower eyelid. Direct excision ( DE) is an accepted method for treating festoons; however , it is not a popular technique for the treatment of dermatochalasis and pigment of the lower lid. DE of the lower lid offers a safe and excellent aesthetic result for dermatochalasis and pigment of the lower lid , without causing lower lid malposition , which can occur with more traditional methods. In addition to being able to remove significantly more skin without risking lower lid malposition , this procedure allows for removal of the most pigmented and poorly textured skin overlying the nasojugal groove. It is an effective alternative to the conventional subciliary and skin pinch approaches.
