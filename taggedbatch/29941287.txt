 Multiple studies have confirmed that human menstrual blood-derived stem cells ( MenSCs) have potential applications in regenerative medicine or cell therapy. However , the contribution of MenSCs to endometrial repair is currently unknown. We evaluated the protective effects of MenSCs on impaired endometrial stromal cells ( ESCs) , as well as the signaling pathways involved in this process. Mifepristone was used to damage human ESCs , which were subsequently cocultured with MenSCs. The proliferation , apoptosis , and migration of ESCs were assessed , together with the expression of related signaling proteins including total p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase , P-p38 , total protein kinase B ( AKT) , P-AKT , β-catenin , and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF). MenSCs significantly recovered the proliferation and migration ability of impaired ESCs , inhibited ESC apoptosis , and upregulated protein expression of P-AKT , P-p38 , VEGF , and β-catenin. Our findings suggest that MenSC-based therapies could be promising strategies for the treatment of endometrial injury , and that AKT and p38 signaling pathways may be involved in this process.
