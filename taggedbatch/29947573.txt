 Engineering of antibodies for improved pharmacokinetics through enhanced binding to the neonatal Fc receptor ( FcRn) has been demonstrated in transgenic mice , non-human primates and humans. Traditionally , such approaches have largely relied on random mutagenesis and display formats , which fail to address related critical attributes of the antibody , such as effector functions or biophysical stability. We have developed a structure- and network-based framework to interrogate the engagement of IgG with multiple Fc receptors ( FcRn , C1q , TRIM21 , FcγRI , FcγRIIa/b , FcγRIIIa) simultaneously. Using this framework , we identified features that govern Fc-FcRn interactions and identified multiple distinct pathways for enhancing FcRn binding in a pH-specific manner. Network analysis provided a novel lens to study the allosteric impact of half-life-enhancing Fc mutations on FcγR engagement , which occurs distal to the FcRn binding site. Applying these principles , we engineered a panel of unique Fc variants that enhance FcRn binding while maintaining robust biophysical properties and wild type-like binding to activating receptors. An antibody harboring representative Fc designs demonstrates a half-life improvement of > 9 fold in transgenic mice and > 3.5 fold in cynomolgus monkeys , and maintains robust effector functions such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity.
