 Background: Cancer-related fatigue<symptom> ( CRF) is very common and can be experienced at all stages of disease and in survivors. CRF causes patients more distress than pain or nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom>. Different pharmacologic interventions have been evaluated for the management of CRF. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of bupropion sustained release ( SR) as a treatment for fatigue<symptom> in patients with cancer. Methods: In this randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , patients with fatigue<symptom> due to cancer were randomly assigned to either 150 mg daily of bupropion SR or matching placebo. The primary endpoint was the changes in average daily fatigue<symptom> from baseline to week 4 using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness-therapy- Fatigue<symptom> ( FACIT-F) questionnaire. Results: 40 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with bupropion SR or placebo ( 20 in each group). Analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA) showed a significant improvement in fatigue<symptom> and quality of life in the bupropion group compared to baseline ( P = 0.000). Secondary outcome , including depression<symptom> , severity of fatigue<symptom> and performance status did n't show significant difference between groups. Generally , bupropion SR was tolerated well. Conclusion: Four weeks of 150 mg bupropion SR improve fatigue<symptom> significantly in cancer patients. Bupropion has potential as an effective and safe pharmaceutical agent for treating CRF.
