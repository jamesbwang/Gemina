 Purpose To examine the diagnostic performance of high-spatial-resolution ( HSR) CT with 0.25-mm section thickness for evaluating renal artery in-stent restenosis. Materials and Methods A 0.05-mm wire phantom and vessel phantoms with renal stents with in-stent stenotic sections of varying diameters were scanned with both an HSR CT scanner equipped with 160-section multi-detector rows ( 0.25-mm section thickness) and a conventional CT scanner. The wire phantom was used to analyze modulation transfer function ( MTF). With the vessel phantoms , the error rates were calculated as the absolute difference between the measured diameters and true diameters divided by the true diameters at the narrowing sections. For qualitative evaluation , overall image quality and diagnostic accuracy for evaluating stenosis in three stages were assessed by two radiologists. Statistical analyses included the paired t test , Wilcoxon signed-rank test , and McNemar test. Results HSR CT achieved 24.3 line pairs per centimeter ± 0.5 ( standard deviation) and 29.1 line pairs per centimeter ± 0.4 at 10 % and 2 % MTF , respectively; and conventional CT was 12.5 line pairs per centimeter ± 0.1 and 14.3 line pairs per centimeter ± 0.1 at 10 % and 2 % MTF , respectively. The mean error rate of the measured diameter at HSR CT ( 8.0 % ± 5.8) was significantly lower than that at at conventional CT ( 16.9 % ± 9.3; P < .001). Image quality at HSR CT was significantly better than that at conventional CT ( P < .001) , but HSR CT was not significantly superior to conventional CT in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion Compared with conventional CT , high-spatial-resolution CT achieved spatial resolutions of up to 29 line pairs per centimeter at 2 % modulation transfer function and yielded improved measurement accuracy for the evaluation of in-stent restenosis in a phantom study of renal artery stents.
