 Congenital hemangiomas ( CHs) are described as vascular tumors that appear as grown masses at birth. Most of the CHs are benign and they are divided into rapidly involuting congenital hemangiomas ( RICHs) , which usually resolve by the age of 14 months , and non-involuting congenital hemangiomas ( NICHs) , which persist and grows with age. There are multiple different conditions that may resemble the presentation of hemangiomas , and it is important to have an early differential diagnosis and tests to provide appropriate care. This case is about a newborn from Mauritius presenting with three vascular tumors diagnosed as congenital hemangiomas.
