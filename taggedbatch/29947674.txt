 Retaining sugarcane straw over the soil after harvesting can improve soil structure and increase soil carbon stabilization , mainly in macroaggregates. We evaluated the carbon content in the aggregate classes in areas under burn and no-burn ( adopted for five years) sugarcane management systems , focusing on the superficial layer ( 0.00-0.20 m). The experiment was carried in an Oxisol and the treatments consisted in burnt sugarcane , manual harvest; burnt sugarcane , mechanized harvest; and no-burn , mechanized harvest. The retention of sugarcane straw on the soil surface is justified by the increase in carbon content and carbon stock in the surface layer ( 0.00-0.20 m) by restructuring of the soil , even though it can not match the structure of the soil under native forest<disease>. Our results suggest that in no-burn management the carbon not occluded inside aggregates was important to increase carbon stabilization in soil and that more attention should be given to macroaggregates 2.00-8.00 mm present in this management system , that showed higher carbon content and was responsible for increase of the geometric and weight diameter , increasing the erosion resistance in the long term in relation to burn systems.
