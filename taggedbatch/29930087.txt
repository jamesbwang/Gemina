 Many potential causes for painful diabetic neuropathy have been proposed including actions of cytokines and growth factors. High mobility group protein B1 ( HMGB1) is a RAGE ( also known as AGER) agonist whose levels are increased in diabetes and that contributes to pain by modulating peripheral inflammatory responses. HMGB1 enhances nociceptive behaviour in na√Øve animals through an unknown mechanism. We tested the hypothesis that HMGB1 causes pain through direct neuronal activation of RAGE and alteration of nociceptive neuronal responsiveness. HMGB1 and RAGE expression were increased in skin and primary sensory ( dorsal root ganglion , DRG) neurons of diabetic rats at times when pain behaviour was enhanced. Agonist-evoked TRPV1-mediated Ca
