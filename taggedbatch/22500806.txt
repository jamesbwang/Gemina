 Transverse cortical microtubule orientation , critical for anisotropic cell expansion , is established in the meristematic root zone. Intending to elucidate the possible prerequisites for this establishment and factors that are involved , microtubule organization was studied in roots of In roots treated with aphidicolin for 12 h , cell divisions still occurred and microtubules were transverse. After 24 and 48 h of treatment , meristematic cell divisions and the prerequisite elongation ceased , while microtubule orientation became random. In meristematic cells of the p60-katanin mutants , apart from a general transverse microtubule pattern , cortical microtubules with random orientation were observed , also converging at several cortical sites , in contrast to the uniform transverse pattern of wild-type cells. Taken together , these observations reveal that transverse cortical microtubule orientation in the meristematic zone of
