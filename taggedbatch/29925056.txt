 Polychlorinated diphenyl sulfides ( PCDPSs) are considered as a class of sulfur-containing dioxin-like pollutants with ubiquitous occurrence in natural waters and potential ecotoxicity to aquatic organisms. However , to date , no information is available regarding the bioaccumulation and biotransformation of PCDPSs in aquatic species. In this study , the uptake and depuration kinetics of 4,4 '- dichlorodiphenyl sulfide ( 4,4 '- di-CDPS) in the freshwater mussel Anodonta woodiana were investigated through semi-static exposure. The uptake rates ( k
