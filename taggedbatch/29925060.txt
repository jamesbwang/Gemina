 Recent reports have suggested that the topical formulation of sirolimus is effective in treating facial angiofibromas in tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC). Here , we determined the safety and efficacy of 0.2 % topical sirolimus for the treatment of facial angiofibroma and compared its effects based on age. This was a retrospective study which involved 36 TSC patients with facial angiofibromas who were treated with 0.2 % sirolimus ointment. Its effect was evaluated using the Facial<symptom> Angiofibroma Severity Index ( FASI). In order to observe its comparative effect based on patient age , a subgroup analysis was performed , between the adult group ( > 18 years old) and the pediatric group ( ≤ 18 years old). The total FASI as well as its subcategories ( erythema , size , and extent) showed statistically significant improvements after the topical treatment with 0.2 % sirolimus ointment ( FASI before treatment: 7.2 ± 1.1 , FASI after treatment: 4.4 ± 1.4 , p < 0.001). Among the subcategories of FASI , the erythema was most significantly reduced with the fastest response to the treatment. In a subgroup analysis , the pediatric group showed significantly greater improvements in FASI ( improvement of FASI in the pediatric group = 49.7 ± 12.2 % , adult group = 27.9 ± 15.6 % , p < 0.001). The serial improvement analysis also showed that the pediatric group achieved a consistently greater improvement in FASI at all visits. Its 1-year application in 3 patients demonstrated a continuous maintenance effect. No significant adverse effects were observed. 0.2 % sirolimus ointment is safe and effective for facial angiofibromas. Considering its higher efficacy in younger patients , an early initiation of the treatment is recommended.
