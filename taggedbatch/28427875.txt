 To analyze prognostic factors following hepatic resection in patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. We retrospectively analyzed 217 patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent hepatic resection at our hospital between January 2006 and December 2015. Disease-free survival and overall survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. The association between recurrence and survival and various clinicopathological factors , including serum alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP) level , platelet count , platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio , neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio , antiplatelet therapy , antiviral therapy , hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> infection , and tumor-related characteristics , were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. The 1- , 3- , and 5-year overall survival rates were 91 , 84 , and 79 % , respectively , and the recurrence-free survival rates were 72 , 51 , and 44 % , respectively. High post-operative AFP level ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.112 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.02-1.21 , High post-operative serum alpha-fetoprotein level and multiple tumors , but not inflammatory factors , were risk factors for poor prognosis in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients after resection.
