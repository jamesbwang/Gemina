 Whether or not phthalates play a role in breast carcinogenesis remains to be determined. The goal of this study was to explore the effects of phthalates on the growth of normal MCF-10A breast cells modulated by breast fibroblasts. Fibroblasts were derived from normal mammary tissue adjacent to both estrogen receptor ( ER) positive and negative primary breast cancers , which were grown separately from nontumorigenic MCF-10A epithelial cells. MCF-10A co-culture cells were treated with 10 nM 17β-estradiol ( E2) , Butyl benzyl phthalate ( BBP) , di ( n-butyl) phthalate ( DBP) , and di ( 20ethylhexyl) phthalate ( DEHP) ( 10 and 100 nM). After incubation for 120 hours , the cells were harvested and extracted for MTT assay. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the proliferative pathway proteins and the effects on ER α. Only fibroblasts from ER ( +) breast cancer significantly stimulated proliferation of MCF-10A cells. Exposure of the co-culture to E2 , BBP , DBP , DEHP , and E2 combined with one of these phthalates resulted in significantly increased cell proliferation , as well as proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA) and ER α expressions. The present study demonstrates that phthalates express a significant influence in fibroblast-epithelial interactions , similarly to the effects of E2 on breast cells. The effects of phthalates on normal breast cells depend upon ER modulating actions. In breast carcinogenesis , phthalates should be considered as having endocrine disrupting potential , even at low concentrations.
