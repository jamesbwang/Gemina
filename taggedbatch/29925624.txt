 Oral vaccines ( OVs) , provide protection against pathogens that infect mucosal surfaces and their potency relies on their capacity to elicit T- and B-cell responses directed to these surfaces. Oral vaccination efficacy has been found to vary considerably with differences in geographical locations and socioeconomic status. Specifically , in children living in resource-poor countries , undernourishment and chronic gastrointestinal ( GI) infection are associated with the failure of OVs , which is a tragic outcome for the children who would benefit most from mucosal-based protection from infection. Both undernutrition and GI infection have been shown to profoundly affect the microbiota , inducing ` dysbiosis ' characterized by narrowed bacterial diversity and increased frequency of bacterial clades associated with the induction of inflammation<symptom>. Recent studies have demonstrated that the microbiota exerts a profound effect on the development of mucosal immune responses. Therefore , it seems likely that OV failure in resource-poor regions is affected by alterations to the immune response driven by dysbiotic changes to the microbiota. Here , we review the contribution of the microbiota to OV efficacy in the context of diet and GI infection.
