 This paper investigates the effect of temperature on the elastic modulus of carbon nanotube-polyethylene ( CNT-PE) nanocomposite and its interface using molecular dynamics ( MD) simulations , by utilizing the second-generation polymer consistent force field ( PCFF). Two CNTs-armchair and zigzag-were selected as reinforcing nano-fillers , and amorphous PE was used as the polymer matrix. For atomistic modelling of the nanocomposite , the commercially available code Materials Studio 8.0 was used and all other MD simulations were subsequently performed using the open source code Large-Scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator ( LAMMPS). To obtain the elastic modulus of the nanocomposite , stress-strain curves were drawn at different temperatures by performing uniaxial deformation tests on the nanocomposite material , whereas the curvatures of the interfacial interaction energy vs. strain curves were utilized to obtain Young 's modulus of the interface. In addition , the glass transition temperatures of the polymer matrix and nanocomposites were also evaluated using density-temperature curves. Based on the results , it is concluded that , irrespective of temperature condition , a nanocomposite reinforced with CNT of larger chirality ( i.e. , armchair) yields a higher value of Young 's modulus of the nanocomposite and its interface. It was also found that , at the phase transition ( from a glassy to a rubbery state) temperature ( i.e. , glass transition temperature) , Young 's moduli of the polymer matrix , nanocomposite , and its interface drop suddenly. The results obtained from MD simulations were verified with results obtained from continuum-based rule-of-mixtures.
