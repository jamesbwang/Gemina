 High-flow nasal cannula ( HFNC) enables delivery of humidified gas at high flow while controlling the F This was a prospective physiological study performed in 16 healthy subjects. The changes in lung volumes were assessed by measuring end-expiratory lung impedance by using electrical impedance tomography. All the subjects successively breathed during 5 min in these following conditions: while in a supine position without HFNC ( T0) and 3 measurements in a semi-seated position at 45 Â° without HFNC ( T1) , and with HFNC at a flow of 30 L/min ( T2) , and 50 L/min ( T3). Compared with the supine position , the values of end-expiratory lung impedance significantly increased with the subjects in a semi-seated position. End-expiratory lung impedance significantly increased after HFNC initiation in subjects in a semi-seated position and further increased by increasing flow at 50 L/min. When taking the end-expiratory lung impedance measurement in subjects in a semi-seated position ( T1) as reference , the differences among the medians of global end-expiratory lung impedance were statistically significant ( In healthy subjects , the semi-seated position and the use of HFNC increased end-expiratory lung impedance globally. These changes were accompanied by a significant decrease in the breathing frequency.
