 Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy , a type of immune effector therapy for cancer , has demonstrated encouraging results in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with refractory hematologic malignancies. Nevertheless , there are toxicities specific to these treatments that , if not recognized and treated appropriately , can lead to multiple<symptom> organ<symptom> failure<symptom> and death. This article is a comprehensive review of the available literature and provides , from a critical care perspective , recommendations by experienced intensivists in the care of critically ill adult chimeric antigen receptor T-cell patients. PubMed and Medline search of articles published from 2006 to date. Clinical studies , reviews , or guidelines were selected and reviewed by the authors. Not available. Not available. Until modifications in chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy decrease their toxicities , the intensivist will play a leading role in the management of critically ill chimeric antigen receptor T-cell patients. As this novel immunotherapeutic approach becomes widely available , all critical care clinicians need to be familiar with the recognition and management of complications associated with this treatment.
