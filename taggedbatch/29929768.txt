 Lactococcin Z is a novel Lactococcus-specific bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> QU 7 that shares 55.6 % identity with lactococcin A. To identify the receptor targeted by lactococcin Z , several lactococcin Z-resistant mutants were generated from the sensitive strain , L.<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> IL1403. The resistant mutants showed difficulties in utilising mannose and glucose as sole carbon sources , contrary to their pattern of growth in the presence of galactose as a sole carbon source. Mutations were found in the ptnC and ptnD genes of lactococcin Z-resistant mutants , which encode the mannose phosphotransferase system ( Man-PTS) components , IIC and IID , respectively; therefore , IIC and IID are proposed as potential receptors employed by lactococcin Z and are the same receptors targeted by lactococcin A. Both lactococcins A and Z share a high percentage identity in their N-termini regions in contrast to their C-termini that show less similarity; this may explain the difference in their action mechanisms as well as the lack of cross-immunity between them. Although lactococcin Z showed bactericidal activity , it neither dissipated membrane potential nor formed pores on the membranes<symptom> of sensitive cells , in sharp contrast to the pore-forming lactococcin A.
