 To investigate the effects of β3-adrenoceptors ( β3-AR) inhibitor SR 59230A on MicroRNAs expression in rat myocardium with chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and the related mechanisms. One hundred male SD rats were randomly divided into sham operated group ( 40) and chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( CHF) group ( 60). Coronary artery ligation was used to induce CHF. Then the rats in CHF group were further randomly divided into CHF control group and CHF+SR 59230A group ( CHF+SR). Rats in the sham group were divided into sham control group and sham + SR 59230A group ( Sham + SR). The rats in Sham + SR group and CHF+SR group were treated with 1 ml SR 59230A ( 85 mmoL/L in 0.9 % saline) twice a day for seven weeks by intraperitoneal injection , while the rats in control groups were injected with the same amount of saline for seven weeks separately. miScript miRNA PCR Arrays were used to determine the expression profile of MicroRNAs. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the distribution of the related proteins in the heart tissue sections. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-κB) , p53 and p53-Phospho-Serine 15 in the heart. ① After Blocking of β3-AR improved the damaged heart in CHF rats; β3-AR caused the change of MicroRNAs expression , and it related to NF-κB signal pathway.
