 The aim of this study was to observe the grey matter ( GM) tissue changes of ischemic stroke patients , to explore the therapy responses and possible mechanism of acupuncture. 21 stroke patients were randomly assigned to receive either acupuncture plus conventional ( Group A) or only conventional ( Group B) treatments for 4 weeks. All patients in both groups accepted resting-state functional magnetic resonance ( fMRI) scan before and after treatment , and the voxel-based morphometry ( VBM) analysis was performed to detect the cerebral grey structure changes. The modified Barthel index ( MBI) was used to evaluate the therapeutic effect. Compared with the patients in Group B , the patients in Group A exhibited a more significant enhancement of the changes degree of MBI from pre- to post-treatment intervention. VBM analyses found that after treatment the patients in Group A showed extensive changes in GMV. In Group A , the left frontal lobe , precentral gyrus , superior parietal gyrus , anterior cingulate cortex , and middle temporal gyrus significantly increased , and the right frontal gyrus , inferior parietal gyrus , and middle cingulate cortex decreased (
