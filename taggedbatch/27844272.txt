 Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) is a common form of cancer of the urinary<disease> tract. The present study aimed to identify driver genes in RCC using a bioinformatics approach. GSE53757 and GSE40435 microarray data were analyzed , and differentially expressed genes were filtered prior to gene ontology ( GO) and pathway analysis. A protein-protein interaction ( PPI) network was established. Overall survival and recurrence were investigated and based on data presented in cBioPortal. The COPS7B gene within the PPI network was selected for further study
