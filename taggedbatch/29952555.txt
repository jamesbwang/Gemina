 Rapid progress achieved on perovskite solar cells raises the expectation for their further development toward practical applications. Moisture sensitivity of perovskite materials is one of the major obstacles which limits the long-term durability of the perovskite solar cells , especially in outdoor operation where rainfall and water accumulation on the solar panels often occur. Micro/nanopinholes within the functional layers of the devices usually lead to water vapor penetration , thus subsequent decomposition of perovskites , and finally poor device performance and shortened operational lifetime. In this work , low-temperature atomic layer deposition ( ALD) technique was utilized to incorporate pinhole-free metal oxide layers ( TiO
