 Sphingosine-1-phosphate is a bioactive lipid and a signaling molecule integrated into many physiological systems such as differentiation , proliferation and migration. In mammals S1P acts through binding to a family of five trans-membrane , G-protein coupled receptors ( S1PRs) whose complex role has not been completely elucidated. In this study we use zebrafish , in which seven
