 The ability to conditionally inactivate genes is instrumental for fine genetic analysis of all biological processes , but is especially important for studies of biological events , such as regeneration , which occur late in ontogenesis or in adult life. We have constructed and tested a fully conditional gene trap vector , and used it to inactivate tbx5a in the cardiomyocytes of larval and adult zebrafish. We observe that loss of tbx5a function significantly impairs the ability of zebrafish hearts<symptom> to regenerate after ventricular resection , indicating that Tbx5a plays an essential role in the transcriptional program of heart regeneration.
