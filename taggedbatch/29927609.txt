 Lanthanide-doped nanoparticles are an emerging class of optical sensors , exhibiting sharp emission peaks , high signal-to-noise ratio , photostability , and a ratiometric color<symptom> response<symptom> to stress. The same centrosymmetric crystal field environment that allows for high mechanosensitivity in the cubic-phase ( α) , however , contributes to low upconversion quantum yield ( UCQY). In this work , we engineer brighter mechanosensitive upconverters using a core-shell geometry. Sub-25 nm α-NaYF
