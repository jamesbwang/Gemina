 In the setting of an increasing incidence of endocarditis<disease> in the United States , we report a patient with necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis<disease> ( GN) associated with native valve bacterial endocarditis<disease> due to Streptococcus<pathogen> parasanguinis<pathogen>. He was started on appropriate antibiotic treatment and subsequent blood cultures showed no growth. However , due to continuing decline in kidney function , immunosuppressive therapy was started. Despite immunosuppressive therapy and antibiotics , renal function did not improve and chronic hemodialysis was required. Due to rarity of condition , there are no definite treatment guidelines available. Antibiotics , steroids , immunosuppressive agents can be of help in most cases. Further research in this regard may help with early diagnosis and better treatment modalities.
