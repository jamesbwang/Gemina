 This work aimed to investigate the prevalence of Staphylococcus<pathogen> in wild birds seized in illegal trade and their antimicrobial resistance patterns. Cloacal samples were obtained from 109 wild birds apprehended in the street markets in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil. Staphylococcus<pathogen> spp. were phenotypically and genotypically identified , and resistance profile was evaluated according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines and by polymerase chain reaction of mecA and blaZ genes. Staphylococcus<pathogen> was detected in 45 · 9 % ( 50/109) of the cloacal swab samples , and 39 ( 78 · 0 %) isolates were resistant to one or more of the nine antimicrobials tested and were also positive to mecA ( 12/39) or blaZ genes ( 14/39). High percentage of resistance was detected to ampicillin , oxacillin , cefoxitin , clindamycin and tetracycline , with the absence of resistance to vancomycin. Wild birds captured and submitted to captive stress conditions of illegal trade market of Brazil may have an important role as reservoirs of Staphylococcus<pathogen> spp. and its antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. The significance of this study is revealed by the zoonotic and pathogenic potential of staphylococci and that impact to public health and requires monitoring polices of wild birds health in tropical areas.
