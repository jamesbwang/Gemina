 The posterodorsal medial amygdala ( MePD) is a sexually dimorphic area and plays a central role in the social behavior network of rats. Dendritic spines modulate synaptic processing and plasticity. Here , we compared the number and structure of dendritic spines in the MePD of prepubertal males and females and postpubertal males with and without sexual experience. Spines were classified and measured after three-dimensional image reconstruction using DiI fluorescent labeling and confocal microscopy. Significantly differences are as follows: ( a) Prepubertal males have more proximal spines , stubby/wide spines with long length and large head diameter and thin and mushroom spines with wide neck and head diameters than prepubertal females , whereas ( b) prepubertal females have more mushroom spines with long neck length than age-matched males. ( c) In males , the number of thin spines reduces after puberty and , compared to sexually experienced counterparts , ( d) naive males have short stubby/wide spines as well as mushroom spines with reduced neck diameter. In addition , ( e) sexually experienced males have an increase in the number of mushroom spines , the length of stubby/wide spines , the head diameter of thin and stubby/wide spines and the neck diameter of thin and mushroom spines. These data indicate that a sexual dimorphism in the MePD dendritic spines is evident before adulthood and a spine-specific remodeling of number and shape can be brought about by both puberty and sexual experience. These fine-tuned ontogenetic , hormonally and experience-dependent changes in the MePD are relevant for plastic synaptic processing and the reproductive behavior of adult rats.
