Reliability , sensitivity , and minimal detectable change of a new specific climbing test for assessing asymmetry in reach technique. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-The aims of this study were to establish intertrial and intersession reliability , sensitivity , and minimal detectable change of a new climbing test specifically for assessing asymmetry in reach technique ( TEST). Twenty-four young climbers ( 16 males and 8 females) participated in this study. The protocol consisted of performing , in counterbalanced random order , 3 tests; TEST , maximum handgrip force , and squat on the bench , in 2 sessions ( with 3 trials for each session). TEST performance was expressed as: TEST performance for left hand ( TESTL) , TEST performance for right hand ( TESTR) , and absolute symmetry index ( ASI). For intertrial and intersession reliability assessment , TESTL and TESTR showed excellent reliability ( intraclass correlation coefficients ranged: 0.96-1.00; SEM % ranged: 0.07-1.23; and coefficient of variation-CV %: 1.28-2.53). In addition , SEMs were smaller than the smallest worthwhile change ( SWC) values ( SWC % = 1.07 and 0.99 for TESTL and TESTR , respectively) , and the minimal detectable change ( MDC95) for both sides was small ( < 4.36 cm). An exception was ASI , which showed low absolute reliability and marginal sensitivity ( SEM % = 15.13 > SWC % = 8.40 and CV % = 41.98). Pairwise test comparisons revealed no difference between sides. Considering the high reliability and the satisfactory sensitivity , TEST can be used to define individual asymmetry in the performance of the reach technique to the left or the right body side in climbers. However , interpreting data using the ASI index requires caution because it had poor absolute reliability and marginal sensitivity.
