 Soybean ( Glycine max) infection by the charcoal rot ( CR) ascomycete Macrophomina phaseolina is enhanced by the soybean cyst<symptom> nematode ( SCN) Heterodera glycines. We hypothesized that G. max genetic lines impairing infection by M. phaseolina would also limit H. glycines parasitism , leading to resistance. As a part of this M. phaseolina resistance process , the genetic line would express defense genes already proven to impair nematode parasitism. Using G. max
