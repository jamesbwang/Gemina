 Between 1990 and 2007 , being the eighth successor leader following Ign√°c Semmelweis at the university department of obstetrics in Baross Street , what interested me mainly were the following: the lucky coincidences needed for the great discovery , the doctor 's hopeless struggles , the circumstances of his death , his five burials and fourfold exhumations , the Hungarianization of his name and the deliberate or unintentional mistakes related to him. In the recollection , my impressions and experiences related to the great predecessor will be reviewed. Orv Hetil. 2018; 159 ( 26): 1071-1078.
