 To study clinical effects of needle Dao for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome<disease><symptom>. From July 2014 to December 2016 , 60 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome<disease><symptom> were divided into two groups: needle Dao treatment group ( treatment group) , and brace and medicine treatment group ( control group) , 30 cases in each group. There were 8 males and 22 females in the treatment group , with an average age of ( 49.38 ± 7.43) years old. There were 7 males and 23 females in the control group , with an average age of ( 50.23 ± 8.71) years old. There were no statistically significant differences between two groups before treatment in age , sex , course of disease , sensory nerve conduction velocity ( SCV) , sensory nerve action potential ( SNAP) , and distal motor latency ( DML). The patients in the treatment group were treated with needle Dao for 1 to 2 times , while the patients in the control group were given celecoxib , vitamin B1 and vitamin B12 , with the brace fixed. After treatment , the changes of SCV , SNAP and DML in two groups were observed. After treatment , the SCV were ( 48.63 ± 7.33) m/s and ( 41.24 ± 6.15) m/s in treatment group and control group separately , the SNAP were ( 9.89 ± 3.71) m/s and ( 8.22 ± 2.19) m/s , and the DML were ( 5.11 ± 2.28) m/s and ( 6.13 ± 2.23) m/s. The SCV , SNAP and DML after treatment were better than those before treatment ( Needle Dao can effectively improve the overall treatment efficiency of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome<disease><symptom> and reduce the symptoms of patients , which is feasible and suitable to use in clinical.
