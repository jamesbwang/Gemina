 Successful multidisciplinary treatment of skull base pathology requires precise preoperative planning. Current surgical approach ( pathway) selection for these complex procedures depends on an individual surgeon 's experiences and background training. Because of anatomical variation in both normal tissue and pathology ( eg , tumor) , a successful surgical pathway used on one patient is not necessarily the best approach on another patient. The question is how to define and obtain optimized patient-specific surgical approach pathways? In this article , we demonstrate that the surgeon 's knowledge and decision making in preoperative planning can be modeled by a multiobjective cost function in a retrospective analysis of actual complex skull base cases. Two different approaches- weighted-sum approach and Pareto optimality-were used with a defined cost function to derive optimized surgical pathways based on preoperative computed tomography ( CT) scans and manually designated pathology. With the first method , surgeon 's preferences were input as a set of weights for each objective before the search. In the second approach , the surgeon 's preferences were used to select a surgical pathway from the computed Pareto optimal set. Using preoperative CT and magnetic resonance imaging , the patient-specific surgical pathways derived by these methods were similar ( 85 % agreement) to the actual approaches performed on patients. In one case where the actual surgical approach was different , revision surgery was required and was performed utilizing the computationally derived approach pathway.
