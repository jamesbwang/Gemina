 The older adult population in Canada is growing , creating a greater demand for long-term care ( LTC) facilities. Seniors living in LTC are more vulnerable to malnutrition , making it important to implement nutrition screening tools on a routine basis. The purpose of this study was to explore the practices of Registered Dietitians ( RDs) related to nutritional screening , nutritional assessment , and follow-ups conducted within LTC facilities. This study also explored possible barriers hindering the application of these practices. Nine RDs from two health regions in Southern Saskatchewan completed a phone interview to address nutrition care practices/policies and barriers in LTC facilities. Results showed a considerable amount of variability in nutrition care practices for screening and assessment with lack of time identified as the greatest barrier. These findings highlight the importance of having consistent policies and a sufficient amount of RDs available in LTC facilities to provide the expected level of nutrition care for residents.
