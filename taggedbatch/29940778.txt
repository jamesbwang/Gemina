 Esophageal cancer ( EC) is a highly complex<disease> disease<disease> with high incidence and mortality rates. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs play critical roles in diverse biological processes including oncogenesis , and we previously reported significantly increased expression of tissue and circulating miR-144 in EC. This study evaluates the functional significance of miR-144 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Herein , we analysed the role of miR-144 in ESCC by silencing it in KYSE-410 cells , and followed this with cell cycle analysis and the following assays; MTT , annexin , colony formation , scratch and matrigel invasion assay. The miR-144 knockdown significantly suppressed ESCC cell proliferation by 72 hours post transfection ( p = 0.029). This significantly decreased the migration , invasion and colony formation potential of KYSE-410 cells compared to cells treated with negative control ( NC). Potential targets of miR-144 were predicted by the in-silico approach followed by in-vitro validation in real time PCR and luciferase reporter assay. The PURA and Spred1 in-silico predicted miR-144 targets were validated by qRT-PCR and luciferase reporter assay. Over-expression of miR-144 significantly decreased PURA mRNA expression by 58.85 % at 24 hours post transfection ( p = 0.009). Further validation by dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed it is a direct targets of miR-144. Our overall study suggests the miR-144 oncogenic role in EC by promoting proliferation and migration of ESCC cells. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report showing PURA as a direct miR-144 downstream target and suggests its potential as a novel therapeutic target for this disease.
