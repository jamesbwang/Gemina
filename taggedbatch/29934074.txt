 A culture follow-up program with an emphasis on symptom assessment may limit antibiotic exposure in patients with Group A Streptococcus<pathogen> on throat<symptom> culture. A quasi-experimental study of such patients was conducted in our Emergency Department and Urgent Care centers. During the prestewardship initiative phase ( March 2011-June 2012) , the standard of care for culture follow-up did not include symptom assessment prior to prescribing antibiotics. During the stewardship initiative phase ( March 2015-June 2016) , culture follow-up was completed with a focus on symptom assessment and antibiotic avoidance. Two-hundred eighty patients were included. Antibiotic prescribing at follow-up decreased from 97.0 % to 71.3 % ( P < 0.001); overall appropriateness of therapy at follow-up , including symptom assessment , increased from 6.0 % to 81.5 % ( P < 0.001). There was no difference in 72-h revisit between the pre- and poststewardship initiative groups ( P = 0.121). This study demonstrated improved antimicrobial prescribing with initiation of a stewardship-focused culture follow-up program in the Emergency Department and Urgent Care centers.
