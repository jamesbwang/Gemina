 Emerging disease threats like Zika pose a risk to na√Øve populations. In comparison to chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , there is scientific uncertainty surrounding emerging diseases because of the lack of medical and public health information available as the threat emerges. Further complicating this are the multiple , diverse channels through which people get information. This article used bivariate and multivariate analysis to first describe the breadth of information sources individuals accessed about the Zika<pathogen><disease><pathogen> virus<pathogen> , and then describe individuals ' primary sources of information for Zika using a nationally representative pooled cross-sectional data set collected at 3 time points in 2016 ( N = 3,698). The analysis also highlights how 3 subgroups-high-education , high-income adults; Hispanic women of childbearing age; and retirees over the age of 65 with less than a high school education-varied in their use of information. Results suggest individuals accessed multiple sources , but TV and radio were the primary sources of Zika information for the public , followed by print news. Demographic variation in primary source of information means public health officials should consider alternative channels to reach target groups in an emerging event. Without an understanding of how information has reached people , and who individuals engaged with regarding that information , public health practitioners are missing a key piece of the puzzle to improving public health campaigns during a future event like Zika. This analysis aims to inform the public health community about the message channels the US population uses during an emerging disease event and the most prevalent channels for different demographic groups , who can be targeted with particular messaging.
