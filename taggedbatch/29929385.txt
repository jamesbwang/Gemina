 Testosterone deficiency is associated with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) progression and poor prognosis. Testosterone therapy has been shown to improve exercise capacity in patients with chronic HF , but no trial has evaluated the impact of replacement in patients with demonstrated testosterone deficiency. Prospective , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , and parallel-group trial comparing testosterone replacement with placebo in males with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF) and testosterone deficiency ( NCT01813201). Long-acting undecanoate testosterone at a fixed dose of 1000 mg was supplied by intramuscular injection at inclusion and then every 3 months. The placebo group received isotonic saline serum. Patients were randomly allocated 1:1 to testosterone or placebo while receiving optimal medical therapy , and the study was conducted for 12 months. The final sample comprised 29 patients , 15 in the placebo group and 14 in the testosterone group ( aged 65 ± 8 , 62 % with an ischemic etiology , left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) 30 % ± 6 % , 69 % New<pathogen> York Heart Association functional ( NYHA II)). After 12 months , testosterone replacement increased testosterone levels ( P = .002) but was not associated with benefit in terms of clinical symptoms and functional capacity including NYHA class , Framingham score , Minnesota Living Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom> Questionnaire , 6-minute walk test , or LVEF and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. No significant side effects associated with testosterone treatment were observed. No effects were found in other hormonal , metabolic , and bone turnover biomarkers. In patients with HFrEF and testosterone deficiency , replacement therapy was not associated with any significant improvement.
