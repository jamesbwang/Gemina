 SummaryThe Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs) are increasingly being used to measure developmental progress among and within countries. Achieving the health-related SDGs remains a primary concern of many developing countries. This study measured the progress in selected health-related indicators of SDGs in the states of India by social and economic groups , and predicted their likely progress by 2030. The health indicators analysed included health outcomes , nutrition , health care utilization and determinants of health. Data from the Census of India , Sample Registration System ( SRS) , National Family and Health Surveys ( NFHSs) and National Sample Survey Organization ( NSSO) were used in the analysis. Annual rate of progress ( ARP) and the required rate of progress ( RRP) were computed for selected indicators over the period 2005-06 to 2015-16. A Composite Index of Health ( CIH) was used to understand the state of health of populations. The ARP was higher than the RRP in maternal care and reduction of under-five mortality , while ARP was lower than the RRP in undernutrition and sanitation. The ARP for health-related indicators showed a mixed pattern across religion and caste groups. The ARP for medical assistance at birth and immunization was highest among Scheduled Castes and that for reduction of under-five mortality was highest among Scheduled Tribes. The CIH was lowest in Uttar Pradesh ( 0.26) and highest in Goa ( 0.81). The association between the CIH and the Human Development Index ( HDI) was significant , suggesting interlinkage between health and development. Notable improvements were observed in maternal and child health and maternal health care utilization across social groups in India over the period 2005-06 to 2015-16 , and if the trends continue the country can achieve the SDG target in maternal health by 2030. However , progress in nutrition and other health indicators has been slow and uneven.
