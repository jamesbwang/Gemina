 Cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT) , consisting of exposure and response prevention ( EX/RP) , is both efficacious and preferred by patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD) , yet few receive this treatment in practice. This study describes the implementation of an Internet-based CBT program ( ICBT) developed in Sweden in individuals seeking OCD treatment in New<pathogen> York. After translating and adapting the Swedish ICBT for OCD , we conducted an open trial with 40 adults with OCD. Using the RE-AIM implementation science framework , we assessed the acceptability , feasibility , and effectiveness of ICBT. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( Y-BOCS) was the primary outcome measure. Of 40 enrolled , 28 participants completed the 10-week ICBT. In the intent-to-treat sample ( N = 40) , Y-BOCS scores decreased significantly over time ( F = 28.12 , df = 2 , 49 , p <. 001). Depressive severity ( F = 5.87 , df = 2 , 48 , p <. 001) , and quality of life ( F = 12.34 , df = 2 , 48 , p <. 001) also improved. Sensitivity analyses among treatment completers ( N = 28) confirmed the intent-to-treat results , with a large effect size for Y-BOCS change ( Cohen 's d = 1.38). ICBT took less time to implement than face-to face EX/RP and participants were very to mostly satisfied with ICBT. On a par with results in Sweden , the adapted ICBT program reduced OCD and depressive symptoms and improved quality of life among individuals with moderate<symptom> to severe OCD. Given its acceptability and feasibility , ICBT deserves further study as a way to increase access to CBT for OCD in the United States.
