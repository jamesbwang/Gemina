 Knee dislocation after total knee arthroplasty , although rare , is a dangerous injury that can lead to neurovascular compromise and permanent disability. With the increase in number of total knee arthroplasty , more and more cases of dislocations are being reported. We describe a novel technique of reshaping the post of a constrained liner to fit into the box of a vanguard primary knee system in a patient with recurrent posterior knee dislocation after a PS TKA with a follow-up of 5 years.
