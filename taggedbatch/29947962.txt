 Inbred mouse strains derived from the species Mus<pathogen> spretus have been very informative in the study of certain gene polymorphisms in inflammation<symptom> and infection. Based on our interest in sepsis<disease> , we used SPRET/EiJ mice and mapped several critical loci that are linked to sensitivity to cytokine-induced inflammation<symptom> and endotoxemia. These studies were based on prominent phenotypes that have never been observed in strains derived from Mus<pathogen> musculus<pathogen> and we mapped them at a resolution that enables us to draw conclusions on the mechanisms. Now that the genome of SPRET/EiJ has been sequenced , and other tools have become available , it is time to revisit this strain and emphasize its advantages and disadvantages as a research tool and a discovery platform.
