 Tumor-associated macrophages ( TAMs) represent potential targets for anticancer treatments as these cells play critical roles in tumor progression and frequently antagonize the response to treatments. TAMs are usually associated to an M2-like phenotype , characterized by anti-inflammatory and protumoral properties. This phenotype contrasts with the M1-like macrophages , which exhibits proinflammatory , phagocytic , and antitumoral functions. As macrophages hold a high plasticity , strategies to orchestrate the reprogramming of M2-like TAMs towards a M1 antitumor phenotype offer potential therapeutic benefits. One of the most used anticancer treatments is the conventional X-ray radiotherapy ( RT) , but this therapy failed to reprogram TAMs towards an M1 phenotype. While protontherapy is more and more used in clinic to circumvent the side effects of conventional RT , the effects of proton irradiation on macrophages have not been investigated yet. Here we showed that M1 macrophages ( THP-1 cell line) were more resistant to proton irradiation than unpolarized ( M0) and M2 macrophages , which correlated with differential DNA damage detection. Moreover , proton irradiation-induced macrophage reprogramming from M2 to a mixed M1/M2 phenotype. This reprogramming required the nuclear translocation of NFκB p65 subunit as the inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation completely reverted the macrophage re-education. Altogether , the results suggest that proton irradiation promotes NFκB-mediated macrophage polarization towards M1 and opens new perspectives for macrophage targeting with charged particle therapy.
