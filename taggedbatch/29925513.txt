 To assess the incidence of acute postoperative endophthalmitis<disease> ( POE) after cataract surgery combined with corneal , glaucoma or vitreoretinal surgical procedures from 2005 to 2014 in France. In this cohort study , acute POE occurring within 6 weeks after surgery was identified by means of billing codes recorded in a national database in patients operated for cataract extraction with phacoemulsification , or corneal , glaucoma or vitreoretinal surgical procedures , either combined or stand-alone. From January 2005 to December 2014 , up to 6 260 477 eyes underwent phacoemulsification cataract surgery as a single procedure and 115 468 eyes underwent phacoemulsification combined with corneal , glaucoma or vitreoretinal surgical procedures. The crude incidence of acute POE after stand-alone or combined cataract surgery was 0.102 % and 0.149 % , respectively. In multivariate Poisson analysis , combined surgery taken as a whole was at higher risk than cataract stand-alone surgery , with an adjusted incidence rate ratio ( IRR) ( 95 % CI) of 1.38 ( 1.11 to 1.70; p = 0.0054). Glaucoma surgeries were associated with a lower acute POE incidence compared with phacoemulsification , conversely to vitreoretinal surgical procedures: IRR 0.63 ( 0.47 to 0.85; p < 0.001) and IRR 1.78 ( 1.58 to 2.01; p < 0.001) , respectively. A higher incidence of acute POE after combined cataract surgery than after cataract surgery done as a stand-alone procedure was observed based on the French nationwide medical-administrative database. The incidence of acute POE after combined surgery was related to the type of surgery performed simultaneously with cataract extraction.
