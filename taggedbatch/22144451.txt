 Brucellosis<disease> and leptospirosis<disease> are among neglected tropical zoonotic diseases particularly in the resource limited countries. Despite being endemic in these countries , there is paucity of information on its magnitude. This study investigated seropositivity of Brucella spp. and Leptospira<pathogen> spp. , and associated factors among abattoir workers and meat vendors in the city of Mwanza , Tanzania. A community based cross-sectional study was conducted in Mwanza city from May to July 2017. Socio-demographic and other relevant information were collected. Detection of Brucella spp. and Leptospira<pathogen> spp. antibodies were done using slide agglutination test and microscopic agglutination test , respectively. Data were analyzed using STATA version 13 Software. A total of 250 participants ( 146 abattoir workers and 104 meat vendors) were enrolled with median age of 31 ( IQR: 25-38) years. The overall , seropositivity of Brucella spp. antibodies was 48.4 % ( 95 % Cl: 42-54). Seropositivity of B.<pathogen> abortus<pathogen> was significantly higher than that of B.<pathogen> melitensis<pathogen> ( 46.0 % , 95 % Cl: 39-52 vs. 23.6 % , 95 % Cl: 18-28 , P < 0.001) while seropositivity of both species was 21.2 % ( 95 % Cl: 16-26). The seropositivity of Leptospira<pathogen> spp. was 10.0 % ( 95 % CI: 6-13) with predominance of Leptospira<pathogen> kirschneri<pathogen> serovar<pathogen> Sokoine which was detected in 7.2 % of the participants. Being abattoir worker ( OR: 2.19 , 95 % CI 1.06-4.54 , p = 0.035) and long work duration ( OR: 1.06 , 95 % CI: 1.01-1.11 , p = 0.014) predicted presence of both B.abortus and B.<pathogen> melitensis<pathogen> antibodies. Only being married ( p = 0.041) was significantly associated with seropositivity of Leptospira<pathogen> spp.. Primary education was the only factor independently predicted presence of Brucella spp. antibodies among abattoir workers on sub-analysis of occupational exposure. None of factors were found to be associated with presence of Brucella spp. antibodies among meat vendors on sub-analysis. Seropositivity of B.abortus antibodies among abattoir workers and meat vendors is high and seem to be a function of being abattoir worker , having worked for long duration in the abattoir and having primary education. In addition , a significant proportion of abattoir workers and meat vendors in the city was seropositive for Leptospira<pathogen> kirschneri<pathogen> serovar<pathogen> Sokoine. There is a need to consider ` one health approach ' in devising appropriate strategies to control these diseases in the developing countries.
