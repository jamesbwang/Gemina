 Due to a high rate of transient human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) infection , HPV<pathogen> genotyping has a low specificity for high-grade cervical<symptom> lesions<symptom> , especially in young women. p16/Ki -67 dual immunohistochemical staining can also be used for the detection of oncogenic changes in cervical cells. Our aim was to compare the performance of p16/Ki -67 dual staining and HPV<pathogen> genotyping in the detection of high-grade cervical<symptom> lesions<symptom> in patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance ( ASCUS)/ low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion<symptom> ( LSIL) on Pap smear. We retrospectively analyzed 310 patients with ASCUS/LSIL on Pap smear , who underwent colposcopy. Among these , 161 patients with suspected lesions<symptom> detected by colposcopy were referred to biopsy. HPV<pathogen> genotyping by LINEAR ARRAY HPV<pathogen> Genotyping Test ( CE-IVD) and p16/Ki -67 dual staining by CINtec PLUS Cytology kit was performed prior to cervical biopsy. The overall sensitivity and specificity of HPV<pathogen> genotyping for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN) 2-3 was 79 % and 72 % , respectively in patients with ASCUS , and 85 % and 64 % , respectively in patients with LSIL. For p16/ki -67 test , sensitivity and specificity rate was 66 % and 93 % , respectively in ASCUS and 59 % and 79 % , respectively in LSIL group. The specificity of p16/Ki -67 staining was significantly higher in both groups in patients aged < 30 years compared to patients > 30 years old ( p < 0.001). Our results showed that p16/Ki -67 dual staining has a higher specificity compared to HPV<pathogen> genotyping , especially in patients under 30 years old. This indicates the usefulness of p16/Ki -67 testing in the triage of patients with ASCUS/LSIL and < 30 years old , prior to the referral to colposcopy and biopsy.
