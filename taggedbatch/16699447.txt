 In kidney transplant recipients , cancer is one of the leading causes of death with a functioning graft beyond the first year of kidney transplantation , and malignancies account for 8-10 % of all deaths in the USA ( 2.6 deaths/1000 patient-years) and exceed 30 % of deaths in Australia ( 5/1000 patient-years) in kidney transplant recipients. Patient- , transplant- and medication-related factors contribute to the increased cancer risk following kidney transplantation. While it is well established that the overall immunosuppressive dose is associated with an increased risk for cancer following transplantation , the contributive effect of different immunosuppressive agents is not well established. In this review we will discuss the different risk factors for malignancies after kidney transplantation.
