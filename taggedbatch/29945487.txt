 Predictors of early or delayed recovery are unclear in peripartum cardiomyopathy ( PPCM). Therefore , we aimed to assess the prognostic value of serial assessment of clinical , echocardiographic and biochemical markers in patients with PPCM. Fifty-two consecutive women with PPCM were enrolled in this prospective study. Each patient underwent transthoracic echocardiography , B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP) and C-reactive protein ( CRP) measurement at admission , and every 3 months. Early recovery was defined as resolution of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> at 6 months postdiagnosis , delayed recovery was defined if the length of time required for recovery of left ventricular function was longer than 6 months , and persistent left ventricular dysfunction ( PLVD) was defined as an ejection fraction of less than 50 % at the end of follow-up. Thirty patients ( 57.7 %) recovered completely , 10 died ( 19.2 %) , and 12 ( 23.1 %) had PLVD. There were no significant differences in baseline BNP and CRP values between patients who recovered completely and who did not recover. However , patients with complete recovery were more likely to have a higher left ventricular ejection fraction , smaller left ventricle end-systolic dimensions at baseline , and lower CRP and BNP levels at follow-up. Elevated levels of BNP and CRP on follow up at 3 and 6 months were associated with nonrecovery. Third and sixth month BNP values were significantly lower in patients with rapid recovery , compared to patients with delayed recovery. Bromocriptine therapy was also associated with early recovery. Persistent elevation of plasma CRP and BNP levels at follow-up portend a slower response or nonrecovery in patients with PPCM. Bromocriptine therapy was an independent predictor of early recovery.
