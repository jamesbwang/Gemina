 Congenital deafness is commonest birth defect and it affects 2-4 neonates among 1000 live births. Detection and intervention especially before 6 months of age prevents severe linguistic , educational and psychosocial repercussions and helps the deaf child in the development of normal speech and language. Children who are identified after 6 months of age experience great difficulties in attaining speech and language.. To find out the frequency of hearing loss in neonates , a hospital based observational study was conducted in Combined Military Hospital Abbottabad from June-to December 2014. One thousand new-borns selected by consecutive sampling within a specified period of time were subjected to Otoacoustic Emission ( OAE) testing. Brain Evoked Response Audiometry ( BERA) evaluation was performed in all those who failed OAE testing to confirm the hearing loss. Children born with microtia , meatal stenosis , cleft palate , craniofacial abnormalities and syndromic illnesses were excluded from the study. Of 1000 new-borns screened , 465 were males and 535 were females whereas 632 ( 63.2 %) were delivered through C-section and 368 ( 36.8 %) were born via SVD. Four hundred and ninety-one ( 49 %) babies had a positive history of consanguinity among the parents. Out of 1000 infants 13 were having hearing loss which was later on confirmed on BERA evaluation. Among them 7 were males and 6 females , 9 ( 69 %) were born through SVD and 4 ( 31 %) through C-section and 8 ( 61.5 %) new-borns had a positive history of consanguinity among their parents. In all these 13 patients only 2 ( 15 %) patients had profound while the remaining 11 ( 85 %) had moderate<symptom> to severe hearing loss. Frequency of hearing loss in neonates is much higher in our study ( 13 per 1000) as compared to other parts of the world and demands that more studies should be undertaken on this subject to confirm this.
