 Aggresome formation is a major strategy to enable cells to cope with proteasomal stress. Misfolded proteins are assembled into micro-aggregates and transported to the microtubule organizing center ( MTOC) to form perinuclear aggresomes before their degradation through autophagy. So far , multiple factors have been identified as the activators of micro-aggregate formation , but much less is known about the regulatory mechanisms of their transport. Here , we report that proteasomal stress leads to the activation of p38 MAPK family members. Two of them , p38γ ( MAPK12) and p38δ ( MAPK13) , are dispensable for micro-aggregate formation but are required for their targeting to the MTOC. Interestingly , p38δ promotes micro-aggregate transport by phosphorylating SQSTM1 , a major scaffold protein that assembles soluble ubiquitylated proteins into micro-aggregates. Expression of the phospho-mimetic mutant of SQSTM1 in p38δ-knockout cells completely rescued their aggresome formation defects and enhanced their resistance to proteasomal stress to wild-type levels. This study reveals p38δ-mediated SQSTM1 phosphorylation as a critical signal for the targeting of micro-aggregates to the MTOC and provides direct evidence for the survival advantages associated with aggresome formation in cells under proteasomal stress.
