 Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation are a very heterogeneous group of genetic protein and lipid glycosylation abnormalities. With some 33 reported patients , MAN1B1-CDG belongs to the more frequent causes of CDG-II. MAN1B1 encodes an α ( 1,2)- mannosidase that removes the terminal mannose residue from the middle branch. Several methods have been proposed to characterize the glycosylation changes. In MAN1B1-CDG , the abnormal accumulating N-glycan structures are mostly absent or found in trace amounts in total human serum. To overcome this issue , we present in this study a straightforward procedure based on the use of Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H to easily diagnose MAN1B1-CDG patients and mannosidase defects.
