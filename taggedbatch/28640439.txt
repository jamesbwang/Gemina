 The development of wearable electronics , point-of-care testing , and soft robotics requires strain sensors that are highly sensitive , stretchable , capable of adhering conformably to arbitrary and complex surfaces , and preferably self-healable. Conductive hydrogels hold great promise as sensing materials for these applications. However , their sensitivities are generally low , and they suffer from signal hysteresis and fluctuation due to their viscoelastic property , which can compromise their sensing performance. We demonstrate that hydrogel composites incorporating MXene ( Ti
