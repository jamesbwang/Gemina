 Despite their essential role in the process of chromosome segregation in eukaryotes , kinetochore proteins are highly diverse across species , being lost , duplicated , created , or diversified during evolution. Based on comparative genomics , the duplication of the inner kinetochore proteins CenH3 and Cenp-C , which are interdependent in their roles of establishing centromere identity and function , can be said to be rare in animals. Surprisingly , the Drosophila CenH3 homolog Cid underwent four independent duplication events during evolution. Particularly interesting are the highly diverged Cid1 and Cid5 paralogs of the Drosophila subgenus , which are probably present in over one thousand species. Given that CenH3 and Cenp-C likely co-evolve as a functional unit , we investigated the molecular evolution of Cenp-C in species of Drosophila. We report yet another Cid duplication ( leading to Cid6) within the Drosophila subgenus and show that not only Cid , but also Cenp-C is duplicated in the entire subgenus. The Cenp-C paralogs , which we named Cenp-C1 and Cenp-C2 , are highly divergent. Both Cenp-C1 and Cenp-C2 retain key motifs involved in centromere localization and function , while some functional motifs are conserved in an alternate manner between the paralogs. Interestingly , both Cid5 and Cenp-C2 are male germline-biased and evolved adaptively. However , it is currently unclear if the paralogs subfunctionalized or if the new copies acquired a new function. Our findings point towards a specific inner kinetochore composition in a specific context ( i.e. , spermatogenesis) , which could prove valuable for the understanding of how the extensive kinetochore diversity is related to essential cellular functions.
