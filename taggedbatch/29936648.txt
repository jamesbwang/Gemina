 Malnutrition is an important risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis ( HD) patients. However , current malnutrition biomarkers seem unable to accurately estimate the role of malnutrition in predicting cardiovascular risk. Our aim was to investigate the role of the Subjective Global Assessment-Dialysis Malnutrition Score ( SGA-DMS) compared to two well-recognized comorbidity scores-Charlson Comorbidity Index ( CCI) and modified CCI ( excluding age-factor) ( mCCI)- in predicting cardiovascular events in HD patients. In 86 maintenance HD patients followed from June 2015 to June 2017 , we analyzed biohumoral data and clinical scores as risk factors for cardiovascular events ( acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , acute coronary syndrome<disease><symptom> and stroke). Their impact on outcome was investigated by linear regression , Cox regression models and ROC analysis. Cardiovascular events occurred in 26/86 ( 30 %) patients during the 2-year follow-up. Linear regression showed only age and dialysis vintage to be positively related to SGA-DMS: B 0.21 ( 95 % CI 0.01; 0.30) p 0.05 , and B 0.24 ( 0.09; 0.34) p 0.02 , respectively , while serum albumin , normalized protein catabolic rate ( nPCR) and dialysis dose ( Kt/V) were negatively related to SGA-DMS: B- 1.29 (- 3.29;- 0.81) p 0.02; B- 0.08 (- 1.52;- 0.35) p 0.04 and B- 2.63 (- 5.25;- 0.22) p 0.03 , respectively. At Cox regression analysis , SGA-DMS was not a risk predictor for cardiovascular events: HR 1.09 ( 0.9; 1.22) , while both CCI and mCCI were significant predictors: HR 1.43 ( 1.13; 1.87) and HR 1.57 ( 1.20; 2.06) also in Cox adjusted models. ROC analysis reported similar AUCs for CCI and mCCI: 0.72 ( 0.60; 0.89) p 0.00 and 0.70 ( 0.58; 0.82) p 0.00 , respectively , compared to SGA-DMS 0.56 ( 0.49; 0.72) p 0.14. SGA-DMS is not a superior and significant prognostic tool compared to CCI and mCCI in assessing cardiovascular risk in HD patients , even it allows to appraise both malnutrition and comorbidity status.
