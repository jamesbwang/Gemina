 Nutritional recovery of early malnutrition with soybean diet reduces liver glycogen stores in the fed state and produces liver insulin resistance. We investigated whether nutritional recovery on a soybean flour diet alters hepatic gluconeogenesis in the adult offspring of rats deprived of protein during pregnancy and lactation. Male rats from mothers that were fed either 17 % ( C) or 6 % ( L) protein during pregnancy and lactation were maintained on a 17 % casein ( CC , n = 16 and LC , n = 17) , 17 % soybean flour ( CS , n = 10 and LS , n = 10) or 6 % casein ( LL , n = 10) diet after weaning. The soybean diet reduced basal serum glucose ( soybean diet = 5.6 ± 0.6 mmol/L vs casein diet = 6.2 ± 0.6 mmol/L; p < 0.05) , but increased alanine aminotransferase mRNA/GAPDH ( soybean diet = 0.062 ± 0.038 vs casein diet = 0.024 ± 0.011; p < 0.01) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA/GAPDH ( soybean diet = 1.53 ± 0.52 vs casein diet = 0.95 ± 0.43; p < 0.05) , and the glycerokinase protein content ( soybean diet = 0.86 ± 0.08 vs casein diet = 0.75 ± 0.11; p < 0.05). The serum glucose concentration ( recovered groups = 5.6 ± 0.5 mmol/L vs control groups = 6.2 ± 0.7 mmol/L , p < 0.05) and pophosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity ( recovered groups = 2.8 ± 0.6 μU/mg vs control groups = 3.6 ± 0.6 μU/mg; p < 0.05) were decreased in rats subjected to protein restriction in early life. The glucose area under the curve during the pyruvate tolerance test did not differ among the groups , whereas glucose area under the curve after glucagon infusion was reduced by early malnutrition ( recovered groups = 4210 ± 572mg/dL .40 min vs control groups = 4493 ± 688mg/dL .40 min; p < 0.001) , and by the soybean diet ( soybean diet = 3995 ± 500mg/dL .40 min vs casein diet = 4686 ± 576 mg/dL .40 min , p < 0.05). Thus , soybean diet impaired the response to glucagon , but did not alter gluconeogenesis.
