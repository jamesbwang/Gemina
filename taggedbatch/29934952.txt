 Cervical necrotizing fasciitis<disease> is a progressive soft<disease> tissue<disease> infection<disease> with significant morbidity and mortality. A case review of cervical necrotizing fasciitis<disease> managed at our institution ( 2007-2017) and a systematic review of PubMed , MEDLINE , and EMBASE databases using the algorithm '' ( cervical OR neck) AND necrotizing fasciitis<disease>. '' There were 1235 cases from 207 articles which were included in our clinical review. Mean age for cervical necrotizing fasciitis<disease> was 49.1 years ( 64.23 % men). Etiology was odontogenic ( 47.04 %) , pharyngolaryngeal ( 28.34 %) , or tonsillar/peritonsillar ( 6.07 %). There were 2 ± 0.98 organisms identified per patient; streptococci ( 61.22 %) , staphylococci ( 18.09 %) , and prevotella<pathogen> ( 10.87 %). There were 2.5 ± 3.22 surgical debridements undertaken. Descending necrotizing mediastinitis<disease> occurred in 31.56 % of patients. Mean length of stay in the hospital was 29.28 days and overall mortality was 13.36 %. Physicians and surgeons must be vigilant of the diagnosis of cervical necrotizing fasciitis<disease> as early clinical findings may be subtle and prompt identification to facilitate aggressive intervention is required to preclude catastrophic local and systemic morbidity and mortality.
