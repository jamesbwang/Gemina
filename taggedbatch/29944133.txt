 The effect of steam explosion on physicochemical properties of sludge and the performance of anaerobic digestion ( AD) was investigated. The steam explosion was conducted under different combinations of temperature and time , ranging 151-198 °C and 4-12 min respectively. The capillary suction time ( CST) and viscosity of the sludge was increased with particle size decreased by improved hydrolysis temperature and prolonged hydrolysis time. The best sludge solubilization achieved was 41.3 % under pretreatment condition of 198 °C and 4 min. Biogas production was enhanced with the improved sludge solubilization , and a linear correlation was found between biogas production and the severity factor ( logR
