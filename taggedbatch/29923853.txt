 Sentinel node biopsy ( SNB) has become standard of care in early stage vulvar cancer. As the correlation of isotope count with the presence of metastases remains unclear , often several active nodes are excised per groin. This can result in increased morbidity in node-negative disease despite of SNB. In the current analysis , we assess whether resection of the hottest node could be sufficient to detect sentinel lymph node ( SLN) metastasis. Patients with primary vulvar cancer receiving an SNB with radioactive tracer at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf between 2008 and 2015 were evaluated. A total of 145 patients with SNB were analyzed; thereof , 144 underwent bilateral SNB , resulting in 289 analyzed groins. A median of 2 SLNs ( range , 1-7) per groin were removed. From 94 ( 32.5 %) of 289 groins , more than 2 SLNs were excised. Median overall SLN isotope count was 1400 cps. In 50 groins , a positive SLN was detected ( unilateral in 38 patients , bilateral in 6). The median number of positive SLN per groin was 1 ( range , 1-4). The SLN with the highest isotope count carried metastases in 36 ( 78.3 %) of 46 groins ( in 4 cases , the highest count was unknown). In 10 ( 21.7 %) of 46 positive groins , the SLN with the highest count was not the metastatic SLN ( 9/10 second highest count). Median count of these 10 SLN was 60 % of the highest count with a range from 11.0 % to 74.0 %. The highest isotope count does not reliably detect the positive SLN in vulvar cancer. To prevent mostly fatal groin recurrences , surgeons should continue to remove all SLN accumulating relevant radioactive tracer over background activity.
