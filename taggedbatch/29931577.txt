 Chronic fluorosis is a systemic condition which principally manifests as defects in the skeleton and teeth. Skeletal fluorosis is characterized by aberrant proliferation and activation of osteoblasts , however , the underlying mechanisms of osteoblast activation induced by fluoride are not fully understood. Therefore , we investigated the pathogenic mechanism of human primary osteoblast proliferation and activation in relation to histone acetylation of the promoter p16 , a well-known cell cycle regulation-related gene. The results showed that sodium fluoride ( NaF) induced deacetylation and decreased expression of the p16 gene via inhibition of specificity protein 1 ( Sp1) binding to its response element , which accounts for NaF increasing cell viability and promoting proliferation in human primary osteoblasts. These results reveal the regulatory mechanism of histone acetylation of the p16 gene on osteoblast activation in skeletal fluorosis.
