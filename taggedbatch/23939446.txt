 An 80-year-old man presented repeatedly to his general practitioner with 3 months of unexplained persistent frontal<symptom> headaches<symptom>. CT head revealed no diagnosis. His dentist diagnosed his co-existing jaw<symptom> pain<symptom> as bruxism. Three months later , the patient happened to attend a routine ophthalmology follow-up appointment. During this routine appointment , features of giant cell arteritis ( GCA) including worrying visual complications were first noted. His inflammatory markers ( C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) were not significantly raised-contrary to the norm. A temporal artery ultrasound and biopsy were performed , in light of the history. This confirmed GCA. He was commenced on high-dose oral prednisolone and was managed by ophthalmology and rheumatology. At 4 weeks , symptoms resolved with no permanent visual loss despite a prolonged initial symptomatic period. Multiple symptomatic presentations to different specialties should therefore alert clinicians to a unifying diagnosis , for example , vasculitis. Serious illnesses may present with severe<symptom> symptoms<symptom> despite normal screening investigations.
