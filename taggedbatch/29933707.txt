 The stress metabolome provides a thorough insight into the signals and hence mechanisms of response of organisms. This is an excellent tool to advance the understanding of interactions , especially for substances like nanomaterials ( NMs) , for which there is an urgent need for alternative methods for hazard assessment. The metabolome of Enchytraeus crypticus was studied for the first time. The case study , CuO NM ( and CuCl
