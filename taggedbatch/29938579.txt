 Family individualization occurs , if at all , at a different pace and to a different extent in various societies and in various parts of society. Its impact has led to new scholarship in the social and caring professions , for which the concept of family is central in both professional education and practice. It is assumed that attitudes toward changing marital norms , family forms , and family relationships affect professionals ' performance. This study , conducted in Israel in 2014 with 157 female health-profession students-102 ( 65 %) Jews and 55 ( 35 %) Muslim Arabs-focuses on attitudes about the family. Three patterns of attitudes emerged: individualized traditionalism-a mix of traditional and individualized attitudes , present among both the Jewish and the Muslim students; individualized autonomy , present mostly among the Jewish students; and classic traditionalism , present mostly among the Muslim students. Implications of these findings for the education and practice of health care professionals are also discussed.
