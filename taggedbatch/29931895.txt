 To observe the expressions of synaptophysin and BDNF/Trk-B in cerebellum of APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice. The healthy 9-month old APP/PS1 male mice ( n1) and the same wild type male mice ( n2) were divided into two groups , APP/PS1 group and wild-type ( WT) group. The expressions of synaptophysin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tyrosine kinase B ( BDNF/Trk-B) in cerebellum were determined by Western blot ( n1 = 6; n2 = 6) and immunohistochemical ( n1 = 4; n2 = 4). The possible synaptic changes in APP/PS1 group were observed by using electron microscopy. Compared with WT group , the expressions of synaptophsin and BDNF/Trk-B in cerebellum were decreased in APP/PS1 group. Increased width of the synaptic cleft and decreased thickness of postsynaptic density were also observed. In APP/PS1 group , expressions of synaptophsin and BDNF/Trk-B in cerebellum were decreased; changes in ultrastructure of synapses seemed to be widespread alterations. These findings suggest a possible association between expression of BDNF/TrkB and synaptic plasticity in AD cerebellum.
