 We report on patient-specific quantitative changes in longitudinal sulfur colloid SPECT/CT as a function of regional radiation dose distributions to normal liver in a cohort of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Dose-response thresholds and slopes varied with baseline liver function metrics , and extreme values were found in patients with fatal hepatotoxicity. Dose-response modeling of normal liver in individual HCC patients has potential to characterize in vivo radiosensitivity , identify high risk subgroups , and personalize treatment planning dose constraints. Hepatotoxicity risk in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) patients is modulated by radiation dose delivered to normal liver tissue , but reported dose-response data are limited. Our prior work established baseline ( SC SPECT/CT images of 15 HCC patients with variable Child-Pugh status ( 8 CP-A , 7 CP-B/C) were acquired in treatment position prior to and 1 month ( nominal) after SBRT ( n = 6) or proton therapy ( n = 9). Localized rigid registrations between pre/post-treatment CT to planning CT scans were performed , and transformations were applied to pre/post-treatment SC SPECT images. Radiotherapy doses were converted to EQD2 Individual patient sigmoid dose-response curves had high goodness-of-fit ( median R Longitudinal SC SPECT/CT imaging revealed patient-specific variations in dose-response , and may identify patients with poor baseline liver function and increased sensitivity to radiation therapy. Validation of this regional liver dose-response modeling concept as a surrogate for patient-specific radiosensitivity has potential to guide HCC therapy regimen selection and planning constraints.
