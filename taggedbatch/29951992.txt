 Electrical stunning ( E) and asphyxia in the air ( A) are two common stunning/killing methods for fish. However , they can stress the fish and affect flesh quality , so an alternative should be found. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of a carbon monoxide asphyxia ( CO) compared to E and A on the evolution of post-rigor mortis changes of rainbow<disease> trout ( Oncorhynchus<pathogen> mykiss) fillets related to chemical , textural and sensorial properties during storage time. Fish fillets from the E group showed higher pH ( p < 0.05) than the A ones , both at time of rigor resolution ( T The carbon monoxide stunning/slaughtering method could be applied on rainbow<disease> trout without detrimental effects on physical , chemical and sensorial characteristic of the fish flesh.
