 Cervical cancer ( CC) is associated with alterations in immune system balance<symptom> , which is primarily due to a shift from Th1 to Th2 and the unbalance of Th17/Treg cells. Using in silico DNA copy number analysis , we have demonstrated that ~ 20 % of CC samples exhibit gain of 8q22 .3 and 19q13 .31; the regions of the genome that encodes the KLF10 and PSG genes , respectively. Gene expression studies demonstrated that there were no alterations in KLF10 mRNA expression , whilst the PSG2 and -5 genes were up-regulated by 1.76 and 3.97-fold respectively in CC compared to normal tissue controls. siRNA and ChIP experiments in SiHa cells have demonstrated that KLF10 participates in immune response through regulation of IL6 , IL25 and PSG2 and PSG5 genes. Using cervical tissues from KLF10
