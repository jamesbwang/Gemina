 RNA editing is the process which happened in the post-transcriptional stage that the genetic information contained in an RNA molecule will be changed. RNA editing has been found to be related with many cancers , so through identifying RNA editing sites , we can find useful information on the process of carcinogenesis. In this review , we will discuss the main types of RNA editing and their role in cancers , as well as the current detection methods of RNA editing and the challenges we should overcome.
