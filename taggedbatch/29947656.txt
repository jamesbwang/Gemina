 The objective of this study was to analyze the level and trend of avoidable deaths and non-avoidable deaths and their contribution to the change in life expectancy in Latin America by studying the situations in Argentina , Chile , Colombia and Mexico between the years 2000 and 2011 , stratified by sex and 5-year age groups. The information source used in this study was the mortality vital statistics , and the population data were obtained from censuses or estimates. The proposal by Nolte & McKee ( 2012) was used to calculate the standardized mortality rates and the influence from avoidable and non-avoidable causes in the change in life expectancy between 0 and 74 years. In Argentina , Chile and Colombia , all the rates declined between the years 2000 and 2011 , whereas in Mexico , the avoidable deaths and non-avoidable deaths rates increased slightly for men and decreased for women. In all the countries , the non-avoidable death rates were higher than the avoidable death rates , and the rates were higher for men. The largest contributions to changes in life expectancy were explained by the non-avoidable deaths for men in all countries and for women in Argentina; in contrast , in Chile , Colombia and Mexico , the gains in years of life expectancy for women were mainly a result of avoidable causes. The results suggest there have been reductions in mortality from these causes that have resulted in gains in years of life expectancy in the region. Despite these achievements , differences between countries , sex and age groups are still present , without any noticeable progress in the reduction of these inequalities until now.
