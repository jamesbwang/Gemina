 Racemases have been applied for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure compounds through the deracemization methods. Mandelate racemase from Pseudomonas<pathogen> putida<pathogen> was the only enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of mandelate enantiomers. Using genome mining approaches , we identified 9 mandelate racemases ( MRs). A novel racemase named ArMR with higher activity and better soluble protein expression , was isolated from Agrobacterium<pathogen> radiobacter. ArMR displayed the optimum catalytic activity at 50 ℃ , pH 7.8 in Tris-HCl buffer. The half-life of ArMR at 50 , 40 and 30 ℃ was 0.17 , 27.2 and 70.7 h , respectively. KM parameter of ArMR towards ( R)- and ( S)- mandelic acid was 1.44 and 0.81 mmol/L , respectively; the corresponding kcat value was 410 s ⁻¹ and 218 s ⁻¹. In addition , KM of ArMR towards ( R)- and ( S) -2-chloro mandelic acid was 6.48 and 6.37 mmol/L , and the corresponding kcat value 0.22 s ⁻¹ and 0.23 s ⁻¹ , respectively. Meanwhile , Mg ² ⁺ and Mn ² ⁺ could activate the enzyme whereas Zn ² ⁺ inactivated the enzyme completely. Discovery of more novel MRs provides supports further research and development of these racemases.
