 Rapidly evolving pathogens , such as viruses and bacteria , accumulate genetic change at a similar timescale over which their epidemiological processes occur , such that it is possible to make inferences about their infectious spread using phylogenetic time-trees. For this purpose it is necessary to choose a phylodynamic model. However , the resulting inferences are contingent on whether the model adequately describes key features of the data. Model adequacy methods allow formal rejection of a model if it can not generate the main features of the data. We present TreeModelAdequacy ( TMA) , a package for the popular BEAST2 software , that allows assessing the adequacy of phylodynamic models. We illustrate its utility by analysing phylogenetic trees from two viral outbreaks of Ebola<disease> and H1N1<pathogen> influenza<pathogen><disease>. The main features of the Ebola<disease> data were adequately described by the coalescent exponential-growth model , whereas the H1N1<pathogen> influenza<pathogen><disease> data was best described by the birth-death SIR model.
