 The rational design and engineering of bimetallic Pd-based nanocatalysts with both high activity and durability are of paramount significance for the practical applications of fuel cells. Herein , a new class of well-defined 2D NiZn oxyphosphide nanosheets ( NiZnP NSs) have been successfully engineered to support unique 3D PdRu nanoflowers ( PdRu NFs) via a facile strategy. Such nanohybrids with abundant surface active areas and modified electronic structure exhibit a great enhancement in electrocatalytic activity for the methanol oxidation reaction ( MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction ( EOR) , whose mass/specific activities are 1739.5 mA mg-1/ 4.5 mA cm-2 and 4719.8 mA mg-1/ 12.3 mA cm-2 , which are 8.3/ 9.0 and 8.3/ 9.5 times higher than those of commercial Pd/C catalysts , respectively. More interestingly , with the remarkable promotional effect of NiZnP NSs , such 3D-2D PdRu/NiZn oxyphosphide nanohybrids can even retain 72.4 % and 70.1 % of initial catalytic activity toward MOR and EOR for 1000 potential cycles with negligible morphological or compositional variations. The successful construction of this new class of electrocatalysts opens up a new way for designing 3D-2D nanohybrids with high performance for electrochemical reactions and beyond.
