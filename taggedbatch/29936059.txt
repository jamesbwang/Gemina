 PSF3 ( Partner of SLD Five 3) is a member of the heterotetrameric complex termed GINS. Previous studies have shown that PSF3 is up-regulated in several cancers and is associated with tumor malignancy. However , the clinicopathological significance of PSF3 expression in endometrial lesions<symptom> is still poorly understood. To investigate whether PSF3 could serve as a useful biomarker for endometrial carcinomas , we performed immunohistochemical analysis of PSF3 expression. In 155 cases of endometrial carcinomas ( ECs) , the mean tumor proportion score ( TPS) of PSF3 expression was 30.7 % in G1 endometrioid carcinoma , 55.0 % in G2 endometrioid carcinoma , 59.0 % in G3 endometrioid carcinoma , and 58.9 % in non-endometrioid carcinomas. In 25 cases of atypical hyperplasia<disease> ( AH) , the mean TPS of PSF3 expression was significantly lower ( 10.4 %). High expression of PSF3 was associated with more advanced pathologic T stage ( P = .000) , lymphatic invasion ( P = .001) , and poor clinical outcomes such as shorter relapse-free survival ( P = .000) and overall survival ( P = .001). When we compared the immunostaining of PSF3 and Ki-67 , the proportions of PSF3-positive cells in tumor epithelial cells were comparable to those of Ki-67-positive cells. However , PSF3-positive cells were selectively found in tumor cells , whereas Ki-67-positive cells were also found in tumor stromal cells. These results demonstrated that PSF3 immunostaining was valuable as a histopathological marker for differential diagnosis between AH and ECs , for tumor histological grading , and for determining a patient 's prognosis. PSF3 may play a crucial role in tumor progression in EC.
