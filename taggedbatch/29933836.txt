 In the class Mammalia , most young are cared for exclusively by their mothers. In species where mothers receive help , however , non-maternal caregivers may play a crucial role in development and life history trajectories. In turn , recipients of such care may have important impacts on caregivers of all types. In Part I of this overview , we briefly review the evolutionary barriers to widespread non-maternal care in mammals , and explain why the exceptions are of particular theoretical importance. We also summarize the current understanding of the selective forces leading to non-maternal care , and the taxa and types of caretakers amongst which it occurs. Finally , we argue for a fresh look at the categorization schemes that have traditionally been used to separate various types of mammalian non-maternal caregivers. This two-part introduction is aimed at scientists from multiple disciplines who study diverse organismal systems. It draws from the social and biological sciences literatures to provide an overview of this special issue of Physiology and Behavior 's suite of methodological offerings and theoretical underpinnings.
