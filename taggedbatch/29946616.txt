 In this work , a novel multi-microfluidic crystallization platform called MMicroCryGen is presented , offering a facile methodology for generating individual crystals for fast and easy screening of the polymorphism and crystal habit of solid compounds. The MMicroCryGen device is capable of performing 8 × 10 cooling crystallization experiments in parallel using 8 disposable microcapillary film strips , each requiring less than 25 μL of solution. Compared to traditional microfluidic systems , the MMicroCryGen platform does not require complex fluid handling; it can be directly integrated with a 96-well microplate and it can also work in a `` dipstick '' mode. The produced crystals can be safely and directly observed inside the capillaries by optical and spectroscopic techniques. The platform was validated by performing a number of independent experimental runs for: ( 1) polymorph and hydrate screening of ortho-aminobenzoic acid , succinic acid and piroxicam; ( 2) co-crystal form screening of the p-toluenesulfonamide/triphenylphosphine oxide system; ( 3) studying the effect of o-toluic acid on ortho-aminobenzoic cooling crystallization ( effect of structurally related additives). In all three cases , all known solid forms were identified with a single experiment using ∼ 200 μL of solvent and just a few micrograms of the solid material. The MMicroCryGen is simple to use , inexpensive and it provides increased flexibility compared to traditional crystallization techniques , being an effective new microfluidic solution for solid form screening in pharmaceutical , fine chemicals , food and agrochemical industries.
