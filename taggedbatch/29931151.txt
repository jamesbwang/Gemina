 Severe burns represent a unique form of trauma in terms of the magnitude and persistence of the stress response they incur. Given advances in acute burn care in the last quarter of a century and the resultant reduction in mortality rates , even for those with massive burns , greater emphasis is now placed on understanding the metabolic stress response to severe burn trauma in order to devise strategies that promote recovery and reduce morbidity. Derangements in metabolism including protein and lipid redistribution and altered glucose handling are hallmarks of the pathophysiological response to burn trauma. In this review article , we aim to distill and discuss the c urrent literature concerning the effect of burn trauma on lipid and glucose metabolism. Furthermore , we will discuss the implications of altered lipid metabolism with regards to insulin sensitivity and glucose control , while discussing the utility of agents and strategies aimed at restoring normal lipid and glucose metabolism in burned patients.
