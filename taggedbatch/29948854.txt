 Recently we have established a new culture condition enabling the derivation of extended pluripotent stem ( EPS) cells , which , compared to conventional pluripotent stem cells , possess superior developmental potential and germline competence. However , it remains unclear whether this condition permits derivation of EPS cells from mouse strains that are refractory or non-permissive to pluripotent cell establishment. Here , we show that EPS cells can be robustly generated from non-permissive NOD-scid Il2rg
