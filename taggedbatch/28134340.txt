 Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 ( SMURF1) is a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in vertebrate development by regulating planar cell polarity ( PCP) signaling and convergent extension ( CE). Here we show that SMURF1 is involved in mammalian heart development. We find that SMURF1 is highly expressed in outflow tract cushion mesenchyme and Smurf1
