 Fournier 's gangrene<disease><symptom> is an acute surgical emergency characterized by high mortality rates ranging from approximately 13 % to 45 %. Therefore , aggressive multidisciplinary management is necessary. A 29-year-old Asian man who had undergone surgical debridement at another hospital to treat a perianal abscess<symptom> 5 days earlier was admitted to our hospital for severe scrotal and perianal pain , swelling , and high fever<symptom>. A physical examination revealed a perianal abscess<symptom>. Furthermore , the scrotum was gangrenous and exhibited extensive cellulitis<disease> in the perineum and bilateral inguinal area. Crepitations between the skin and fascia were palpable. A diagnosis of Fournier 's gangrene<disease><symptom> was made. The patient was treated with immediate surgical debridement under general anesthesia. He received broad-spectrum antibiotics , and debridement was repeated until the wound<disease><symptom> exhibited healthy granulation. Because both testes were severely exposed , they were transpositioned back into the scrotum 1 week after surgery. The patient was discharged on the 11th postoperative day. The mainstay of treatment for Fournier 's gangrene<disease><symptom> should include fluid resuscitation , broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy , intensive care , nutritional support , and early aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue.
