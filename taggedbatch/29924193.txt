 Nitrogen mustard ( NM) is a devastating casualty agent in chemical warfare. There is no effective antidote to treat NM-induced ocular injury. We aimed to assess the effects of proanthocyanidin ( PAC) and coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ10) on NM-induced ocular injury. Eighteen male rats were divided into the following 4 groups: NM , NM + PAC , NM + CoQ10 , and control. The 3 NM groups received a single dose of NM ( 0.02 mg/Î¼L) on the right eye to induce ocular injury. The control group received saline only. Thirty minutes after the application of NM , the NM + PAC group received PAC ( 100 mg/kg) via gastric gavage , while the NM + CoQ10 group received CoQ10 ( 10 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. PAC and CoQ10 were administered once a day for 5 consecutive days. The rats were then sacrificed. Macroscopic images of the eyes were examined and eye tissues were collected for histology. The treatment groups were compared to the control group with regard to both corneal<symptom> opacity<symptom> and lid injury scores. The findings were not significantly different for both the NM + PAC and NM + CoQ10 groups. In both the NM + PAC and NM + CoQ10 groups , the histological changes seen in the NM group demonstrated improvement. Our results indicate that PAC and CoQ10 treatments have therapeutic effects on NM-induced ocular injury in a rat model. PAC and CoQ10 may be novel options in patients with NM-induced ocular injury.
