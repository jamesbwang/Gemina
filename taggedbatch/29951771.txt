 Monitoring of chemicals of toxicological concern in food is commonly needed for many purposes , which include ( in part) food safety , regulatory enforcement , risk assessment , international food trade , label claims , environmental protection , industry needs , academic research , and consumer confidence. Chemicals of current concern include a variety of toxins , pesticides , veterinary drugs , growth promoters , environmental contaminants , toxic metals , allergens , endocrine disruptors , genetically modified organisms , melamine , acrylamide , furans , nitrosamines , food additives , packaging components , and miscellaneous other chemicals. In light of past crises , the potential harm from known or unknown chemicals not currently monitored are a source of additional concern by the food industry , regulators , scientists , and consumers. As global food trade has expanded and detection techniques have improved , chemical contaminant analysis of foods has also increased in importance and activity. This critical review article is aimed to highlight current trends in the literature , including neglected research needs , on the analysis of chemicals of toxicological concern in foods.
