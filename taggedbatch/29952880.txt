 Systematic review. To investigate the effects of Kinesio Taping ( KT) in patients with non-specific low<symptom> back pain. KT is widely used in patients with low<symptom> back pain. We conducted searches on PubMed , EMBASE , PEDro , SciELO and LILACS up to February 26 , 2018. We included only randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) in adults with chronic non-specific low<symptom> back pain that compared KT to no intervention or placebo as well as RCTs that compared KT combined with exercise against exercise alone. The methodological quality and statistical reporting of the eligible trials were measured by the 11-item PEDro scale. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE classification. We considered pain intensity and disability as the primary outcomes. Whenever possible , the data were pooled through meta-analysis. We identified eleven RCTs for this systematic review ( pooled n = 743). Two clinical trials ( pooled n = 100) compared KT to no intervention at the short-term follow-up. Four studies compared KT to placebo ( pooled n = 287) at short-term follow-up and two trials ( pooled n = 100) compared KT to placebo at intermediate-term follow-up. Five trials ( pooled n = 296) compared KT combined with exercises or electrotherapy to exercises or spinal manipulation alone. No statistically significant difference was found for most comparisons. Very low<symptom> to moderate quality evidence shows that KT was no better than any other intervention for most the outcomes assessed in patients with chronic non-specific low<symptom> back pain. We found no evidence to support the use of KT in clinical practice for patients with chronic non-specific low<symptom> back pain. 1.
