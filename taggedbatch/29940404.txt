 Spectroscopic techniques can provide valuable information about post-mortem meat quality. In the current study , Raman , NIR and fluorescence spectroscopy was used to analyze pH , drip loss and intramuscular fat in pork longissimus lumborum ( n = 122) at 4-5 days post-mortem. Results were promising for partial least squares regression ( PLSR) from Raman spectroscopy , giving coefficients of determination from cross validation ( r
