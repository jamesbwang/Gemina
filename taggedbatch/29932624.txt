 Despite decades of cultivating microorganisms for use in drug discovery , few attempts have been made to measure the extent to which common cultivation techniques have accessed existing chemical space. Metagenomic studies have shown that cultivable bacteria represent a fraction of those that exist in the environment , and that uncultivated populations in sediment have genes that encode for a high diversity of novel natural product ( NP) biosynthetic enzymes. Quantifying these genes in both sediment and cultivatable bacterial populations allows us to assess how much diversity is present on nutrient agar and is critical to guiding the trajectory of future NP discovery platforms. Herein , we employed next-generation amplicon sequencing to assess the NP biosynthetic gene populations present in two Lake Huron sediment samples , and compared these with populations from their corresponding cultivatable bacteria. We highlight three findings from our study: ( 1) after cultivation , we recovered between 7.7 % and 23 % of three common types of NP biosynthetic genes from the original sediment population; ( 2) between 76.3 % and 91.5 % of measured NP biosynthetic genes from nutrient agar have yet to be characterized in known biosynthetic gene cluster databases , indicating that readily cultivatable bacteria harbor the potential to produce new NPs; and ( 3) even though the predominant taxa present on nutrient media represented some of the major producers of bacterial NPs , the sediment harbored a significantly greater pool of NP biosynthetic genes that could be mined for structural novelty , and these likely belong to taxa that typically have not been represented in microbial drug discovery libraries.
