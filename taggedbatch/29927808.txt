 The present study investigated the relationship between accumbal ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1) signaling in alcohol reward in female rats. Animals with guide cannulae targeting the nucleus accumbens core ( NAcC) and shell ( NAcS) were habituated to alcohol for 12 weeks through a two-bottle intermittent access paradigm. JMV2959 , a ghrelin antagonist , and exendin-4 ( Ex-4) , a GLP-1 agonist , were microinjected at the onset of the nocturnal cycle. Alcohol , food , water , and total fluid intake were measured 2 , 6 , and 24 h postinjection. Results indicated that JMV2959 reduced alcohol consumption when injected into both the NAcC and NAcS. Ex-4 administration as well as combined JMV2959 and Ex-4 treatment reduced intake when injected into the NAcS , but not the NAcC. These effects were time-dependent. JMV2959 had no effect on food intake when administered into either the NAcC or the NAcS , whereas Ex-4 decreased food intake when injected separately into both structures. The combination of JMV2959 and Ex-4 decreased food intake when administered only into the NAcC. These effects were also time-dependent. No estrous-related effects on alcohol or food intake were found. However , water and total fluid intake were increased during the metestrus and diestruses phases of the estrous cycle compared with the proestrus and estrus phases. Overall , these findings demonstrate the importance of accumbal ghrelin and GLP-1 signaling in alcohol reward and appetitive motivation.
