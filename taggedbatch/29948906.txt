 The functional brain network has gained increased attention in the neuroscience community because of its ability to reveal the underlying architecture of human brain. In general , majority work of functional network connectivity is built based on the correlations between discrete-time-series signals that link only two different brain regions. However , these simple region-to-region connectivity models do not capture complex connectivity patterns between three or more brain regions that form a connectivity subnetwork , or subnetwork for short. To overcome this current limitation , a hypergraph learning-based method is proposed to identify subnetwork differences between two different cohorts. To achieve our goal , a hypergraph is constructed , where each vertex represents a subject and also a hyperedge encodes a subnetwork with similar functional connectivity patterns between different subjects. Unlike previous learning-based methods , our approach is designed to jointly optimize the weights for all hyperedges such that the learned representation is in consensus with the distribution of phenotype data , i.e. clinical labels. In order to suppress the spurious subnetwork biomarkers , we further enforce a sparsity constraint on the hyperedge weights , where a larger hyperedge weight indicates the subnetwork with the capability of identifying the disorder condition. We apply our hypergraph learning-based method to identify subnetwork biomarkers in Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD). A comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis is performed , and the results show that our approach can correctly classify ASD and ADHD subjects from normal controls with 87.65 and 65.08 % accuracies , respectively.
