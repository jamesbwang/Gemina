 The phase I study characterized the safety , pharmacokinetics , anti-tumor activity , and recommended phase II dose/schedule of LY3164530 in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. Patients received LY3164530 on days 1 and 15 ( Schedule 1: 300 , 600 , 1000 , and 1250 mg) or Days 1 , 8 , 15 , and 22 ( Schedule 2: 500 and 600 mg) of each 28 days cycle. Dose escalation used a modified toxicity probability interval model. Dose escalation defined a maximum tolerated dose ( MTD) of 1000 mg on Schedule 1 and 500 mg on Schedule 2. Treatment-emergent adverse events related to study treatment were consistent with epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) inhibition and included maculopapular rash/dermatitis acneiform ( 83 % , Grade 3/4 17 %) , hypomagnesemia ( 55 % , Grade 3/4 7 %) , paronychia<disease> ( 35 %) , fatigue<symptom> ( 28 % , Grade 3/4 3 %) , skin fissures ( 24 %) , and hypokalemia ( 21 % , Grade 3/4 7 %). Partial response was achieved in three patients on Schedule 2 with colorectal cancer ( n = 2) or squamous cell cancer. Overall response rate ( ORR) was 10.3 % , disease control rate ( ORR + stable disease ( SD)) was 51.7 and 17.2 % of patients had SD â‰¥ 4 months. The in vivo stability of the bispecific antibody was confirmed. Schedule 2 provided greater and more consistent inhibition of mesenchymal-epithelial transition ( MET)/ EGFR throughout the dosing interval than Schedule 1. Although this study defined the LY3164530 MTD and pharmacokinetics on both schedules , significant toxicities associated with EGFR inhibition and lack of a potential predictive biomarker limit future development. Nonetheless , the results provide insight into the development of bispecific antibody therapy.
