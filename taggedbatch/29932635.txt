 The Nernst-Planck-Poisson model is used for modeling the sensitivity and selectivity of ion-selective electrodes ( ISEs) with plastic membranes<symptom>. Two pivotal parameters characterizing ISE response are in focus: sensitivity and selectivity. An interpretation of sensitivity , which considers the concurrent influence of anions and cations on the ISE slope , is presented. The interpretation of selectivity shows the validity and limits of approaches hitherto taken to measure the true ( unbiased) selectivity coefficient. The validity of more idealized interpretations by the diffusion-layer model is conceived.
