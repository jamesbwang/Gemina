 Localized surface plasmon resonance based on coupled metallic nanoparticles has been extensively studied in the refractive index sensing and the detection of molecules. The amount of resonance peak-shift depends on the refractive index of surrounding medium and the geometry/symmetry of plasmonic oligomers. It has recently been found that as the feature size or the gap distance of plasmonic nanostructures approaches several nanometers , quantum effects can change the plasmon coupling in nanoparticles. However , most of the research on plasmonic sensing has been done based on classical local calculations even for the interparticle gap below ~ 3 nm , in which the nonlocal screening plays an important role. Here , we theoretically investigate the nonlocal effect on the evolution of various plasmon resonance modes in strongly coupled nanoparticle dimer and trimer antennas with the gap down to 1 nm. Then , the refractive index sensing in these nonlocal systems is evaluated and compared with the results in classical calculations. We find that in the nonlocal regime , both refractive index sensibility factor and figure of merit are actually smaller than their classical counterparts mainly due to the saturation of plasmon shifts. These results would be beneficial for the understanding of interaction between light and nonlocal plasmonic nanostructures and the development of plasmonic devices such as nanosensors and nanoantennas.
