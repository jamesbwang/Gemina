 Adipocere formation depends upon multiple environmental factors. In comparison with temperate countries , it usually develops early in the subtropical climate. We have studied a retrospective data of 31 cases with adipocere formation at Department of Forensic Medicine at All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi. Most of the cases were recovered during the month of May to October from closed rooms at home , open grounds , open forest<disease> areas , various water sources , and riverbanks. The time duration of recovery from the time of death was from 12 h to 7 days 12 h. In 10 cases , adipocere formation was seen within 2 days , and in four male cases among them , the adipocere formed within a day. Most of the bodies showing adipocere formation within 2 days were recovered from land. These facts showed that subtropical climate having hot and humid weather promotes early adipocere formation compared to temperate climate.
