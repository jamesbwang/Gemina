 In this paper , we investigate how crude oil price and volume traded affected the profitability of oil and gas companies in the United Kingdom ( UK) since the financial crisis started in 2008. The study benefit from insights of the financial statements , to develop a model that focuses on how changes in oil price impact corporate performance. In order to observe the financial indicators that influence the performance , as well as the effects that changes in oil prices and demand of crude oil have on the profitability of oil and gas companies , we apply comparative regression analysis , including the generalised method of moments estimation technique for panel data set. The sample is consisting of 31 oil and gas companies in the UK , and the period analysed is 2006-2014. Results show that profitable oil and gas companies managed to face the drop in oil price and recover , characterized by significant cash flows and stock turnover , efficient use of assets , and high solvency rates. Although the oil price and volume traded do not significantly affect profitability and other financial ratios , if the oil price continues to decrease , it would permanently alter both the UK economy and oil and gas companies. In order to survive , companies make drastic cuts and defer essential investments , often at the long-term expense of asset performance. This study is important in a world where the energy consumption steadily grew over time. However , the renewable energy is cheaper and more environmentally friendly , and thus , countries where oil and gas industry is one of the most popular sectors face an economic decline. These results could be useful for investors , managers or decision makers , reclaiming strategic decisions in the current uncertain and volatile environment.
