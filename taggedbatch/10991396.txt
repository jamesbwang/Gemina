 Polarization-dependent sum frequency generation ( SFG) vibrational spectroscopy was employed to examine CO overlayers on Pt ( 111) and Pd ( 111) single crystal surfaces at room temperature. Utilizing different polarization combinations ( SSP and PPP) of the visible and SFG light allows to determine the molecular orientation ( tilt angle) of interface molecules but the analysis of the measured
