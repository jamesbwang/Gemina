 While investigations have been performed examining the quality of US-based cost-utility analyses for other orthopaedic subspecialties and have provided important insights , a similar analysis has not been performed examining the foot and ankle literature. A systematic review of foot and ankle studies was conducted to identify cost-utility analyses published between 2000 and 2017. Of 687 studies screened by abstract , 4 cost-utility studies were identified and scored by the Quality of Health Economic Studies instrument. Of these 4 studies , 3 examined end-stage arthritis<disease><symptom> and 1 examined unstable ankle fractures. Cost-effective interventions identified by these studies included the performance of total ankle arthroplasty over ankle arthrodesis or nonoperative treatment for end-stage arthritis<disease><symptom> and suture button fixation over syndesmotic screws for unstable supination-external rotation ankle fractures. The mean Quality of Health Economic Studies scores for these studies was 87.5. Despite the increasing focus on value-based care delivery in the United States , there are few foot and ankle cost-utility analyses. Nonetheless , the quality of existing analyses is high. Certain interventions have been identified as cost-effective as highlighted above and the findings of this review can be used to help design future analyses in order to best demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of foot and ankle interventions.
