 The objective of the investigation was to evaluate the percutaneous penetration of a ubidecarenone-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier ( UB-NLC) and to illuminate the protective effects of UB-NLC for amelioration of hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative damage on HaCaT cells. Ubidecarenone ( UB) was encapsulated in a nanostructured lipid carrier ( NLC) , which was manufactured by homogenization. The morphological and dimensional properties of the prepared UB-NLC were studied by freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy ( FF-TEM) and photon correlation spectroscopy ( PCS). Percutaneous penetration of UB-NLC was carried out by the Franz diffusion cells method. The change of cellular morphology was identified through a non-invasive time-lapse imaging system. The assessment was achieved via the evaluation of the levels of oxidative stress markers: reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , glutathione peroxidase ( GSH-PX) , and malondialdehyde ( MDA). Percutaneous penetration of UB loaded in NLC formulation was enhanced in comparison to free UB. Preincubation of HaCaT cells with UB-NLC attenuated the level of intracellular generation of ROS. Lipid peroxidation was diminished by UB-NLC via inhibition of MDA formation. Pretreatment of cells with UB-NLC reestablished the activity of cellular antioxidant enzymes ( SOD and GSH-PX). On the basis of the investigation conducted , results suggest that formulating UB as NLC is advantageous for topical delivery and treatment of oxidative stress-induced human<disease> diseases<disease>.
