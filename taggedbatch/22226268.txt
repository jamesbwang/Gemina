 Traditional continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM) provides detailed information on glucose patterns and trends to inform daily diabetes management decisions , which is particularly beneficial for patients with a history of hypoglycemia unawareness. However , a high level of patient adherence ( ≥ 70 %) is required to achieve clinical benefits. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of real-world patient nonadherence and early discontinuation on healthcare resource use. A cost calculator was designed to evaluate monthly healthcare resource waste within the first year of traditional CGM initiation by combining estimates of real-world nonadherence and early discontinuation from the literature with the wholesale acquisition costs of the current technology in the United States ( for a commercial payer and for Medicare) , or its equivalent in Sweden , Germany , or the Netherlands. Based on an early discontinuation rate of 27 % and nonadherence rates of 13.9 % -31.1 % over the 12 months following initiation , the healthcare resource waste associated with nonadherence and early discontinuation was $ 220,289 and $ 21,775 , respectively , for every 100 patients initiating CGM in the U.S. commercial payer scenario. In the Medicare scenario , the corresponding figures were $ 72,648 and $ 5,675 , respectively. In both scenarios , nonadherence and early discontinuation accounted for ∼ 24 % of resources being wasted within the first year of CGM initiation. Similar results were observed using the local costs in the other countries analyzed. The healthcare resource waste associated with traditional CGM nonadherence and early discontinuation warrants deliberate consideration when selecting suitable patients for this technology.
