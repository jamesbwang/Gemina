 Women with a family history of breast cancer ( BC) often overestimate their BC risk. Heightened psychological distress may interfere with risk comprehension and screening adherence. The primary purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a 12-week manual-based supportive-expressive ( SE) group intervention for this population. Using a randomized control trial design , this study compared two interventions: a standard risk-counseling arm ( RC) compared with that plus SE group intervention. The primary study outcome was BC anxiety<symptom>. Secondary outcomes included psychosocial functioning , risk comprehension , BC knowledge , and screening behaviors. A total of 161 women with a family history of BC were randomized into SE ( N = 108) or RC ( N = 53). Participants in both study arms significantly improved on measures of BC anxiety<symptom> , psychosocial functioning , risk comprehension , and BC knowledge , with no statistical difference between study arms. Benefits were sustained at 1 year. BC screening rates were high in both arms at baseline and follow-up. SE group therapy as an added intervention to the risk counseling was well-received , however , did not demonstrate superiority to RC alone. Future studies on treatment matching are needed to further our understanding of interventions that can support women with a family history of BC to work through residual issues , including loss and grief.
