 Chronic pancreatitis<disease> is increasingly recognized in the pediatric population. Atrophy is an important , but qualitative , finding of chronic pancreatitis<disease>. To transition to a quantitative measure that can specifically define atrophy requires knowledge of normal pancreatic parenchymal bulk in children. The purpose of this study was to define normal pancreatic thickness ( linear measurements) at multiple anatomic locations in the pancreas of healthy children. This was an Institutional Review Board-approved , Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA)- compliant retrospective study. Three reviewers measured the thickness of the pancreas at four locations ( head , neck , body , tail) on computed tomography ( CT) examinations performed with intravenous contrast in children without a history of pancreatic disease. Measurements were made on 140 examinations , evenly distributed among 7 age groups ( 3-16.99 years) with 10 males and 10 females in each group. Agreement and bias between reviewers were assessed by intra-class correlation coefficients ( ICC) and Bland-Altman analyses. Correlation with age , height and weight were assessed with Spearman 's rho ( ρ). The mean ( for 3 readers) thicknesses of the head , neck , body and tail were 1.3-2 cm , 0.7-1 cm , 0.9-1.6 cm and 1-1.6 cm , respectively , depending on patient age. Measurement agreement between reviewers was fair to good ( ICC: 0.52-0.7). Bias between reviewers ranged from 0 to 3 mm. Pancreatic thickness was weakly to moderately correlated with age ( ρ = 0.39-0.52) , height ( ρ = 0.44-0.61) and weight ( ρ = 0.51-0.64). We have defined normal ranges for thickness of the pancreas at four locations , and have shown that these measurements depend on patient age and size. These data may be useful to more objectively define pancreatic atrophy in children with suspected pancreatic disease.
