 Previous studies have shown the effect of a lead vehicle 's speed , deceleration rate and headway distance on drivers ' brake response times. However , how drivers perceive this information and use it to determine when to apply braking is still not quite clear. To better understand the underlying mechanisms , a driving simulator experiment was performed where each participant experienced nine deceleration scenarios. Previously reported effects of the lead vehicle 's speed , deceleration rate and headway distance on brake response time were firstly verified in this paper , using a multilevel model. Then , as an alternative to measures of speed , deceleration rate and distance , two visual looming-based metrics ( angular expansion rate θ˙ of the lead vehicle on the driver 's retina , and inverse tau τ
