 Heavy metal ( HM) pollution of soils is one of the most important and unsolved environmental problems affecting the world , with alternative solutions currently being investigated through different approaches. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> ( AMF) are soil inhabitants that form symbiotic relationships with plants. This alleviates HM toxicity in the host plant , thereby enhancing tolerance. However , the few investigations that have addressed the presence of metals in the fungus structures were performed under experimental conditions , with there being no results reported for Pb. The current study represents a first approximation concerning the capability of spores to accumulate Pb in the AMF community present in a Pb polluted soil under field conditions. Micro X-ray fluorescence was utilized to obtain a direct observation of Pb in spores , and the innovation of total reflection X-ray fluorescence was applied to obtain Pb quantification in spores. The AMF community included species of Ambisporaceae , Archaeosporaceae , Gigasporacea , Glomeraceae and Paraglomeraceae , and was tolerant to high Pb concentrations in soil. Pb accumulation in AMF spores was demonstrated at the community level and corroborated by direct observation of the most abundant spores , which belonged to the Gigasporaceae group. Spore Pb accumulation is possibly dependent on the AMF and host plant species.
