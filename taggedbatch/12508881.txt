 Crohn 's disease ( CD) patients who undergo ileocolonic resection ( ICR) typically have disease recurrence at the anastomosis which has been linked with a gut dysbiosis. The aims of this study were to define the mucosa-associated microbiota at the time of ICR and to determine if microbial community structure at the time of surgery was predictive of future disease relapse. Ileal biopsies were obtained at surgery and after 6 months from CD subjects undergoing ICR. Composition and function of mucosal-associated microbiota was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing and PICRUSt analysis. Endoscopic recurrence was assessed using the Rutgeerts score. Analysis of mucosal biopsies taken at the time of surgery showed that decreased Clostridiales together with increased Enterobacteriales predicted disease recurrence. An increase in the endospore-forming Lachnospiraceae from surgery to 6 months post-ICR was associated with remission. A ratio of 3:1 between anaerobic endospore-forming bacterial families and aerobic families within the Firmicutes phylum was predictive of maintenance of remission. Gut recolonization following ICR is facilitated by microbes which are capable of either aerobic respiration<symptom> or endospore formation. The relative proportions of these species at the time of surgery may be predictive of subsequent microbial community restoration and disease recurrence.
