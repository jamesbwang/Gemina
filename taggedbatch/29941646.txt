 Eravacycline ( 7-fluoro-9-pyrrolidinoacetamido-6-demethyl-6-deoxytetracycline or TP-434) is a novel , fully synthetic broad-spectrum fluorocycline with potent activity against Gram positive bacteria , anaerobes , and MDR Enterobacteriaciae. We characterized the plasma pharmacokinetics and conducted a comprehensive analysis of eravacycline tissue distribution in rabbits after multiple day dosing. Eravacycline for single-dose-pharmacokinetics was administered to NZW rabbits at 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 & 10 mg/kg intravenously ( IV) QD ( n = 20). Eravacycline for multi-dose-pharmacokinetics was administered at 0.5 , 1 , 2 , and 4 mg/kg IV QD ( n = 20) for 6 days. Eravacycline concentrations in plasma and tissues were analyzed by LC/MS/MS assay. Mean AUCs following a single eravacycline dose ranged from 5.39 μg · h/ml to 183.53 μg · h/ml. Within the multi-dose study , mean AUCs ranged from 2.53 μg · h/ml to 29.89 μg · h/ml. AUCs correlated linearly within the dosage range ( r = 0.97; p = 0.0001). In the cardiopulmonary system , concentrations were greatest in lung > heart > PAMs > BAL fluid; for the intraabdominal system: bile > liver > gall bladder > spleen > pancreas; for the renal system: urine > renal cortex > renal medulla; for musculoskeletal tissues: muscle psoas > bone<disease> marrow > adipose , for the CNS system: cerebrum > aqueous humor > CSF > choroid > vitreous. Concentrations in prostate and seminal vesicles demonstrated relatively high mean concentrations. The plasma pharmacokinetic profile of 0.5 to 4 mg/kg in NZW rabbits yields comparable exposure to that of humans ( 1 or 2 mg/kg Q12h) and demonstrates target tissue concentrations in most sites.
