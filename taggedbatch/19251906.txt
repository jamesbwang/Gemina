 Mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) cascades , an important type of pathway in eukaryotic signaling networks , play a key role in plant defense responses , growth and development. Phylogenetic analysis and conserved motif analysis of the MKK and MPK families in We characterized six Our data led us to propose that CmMKK4-CmMPK13 and CmMKK2-CmMPK4 may be involved in regulating salt resistance and in the relationship between CmMKK9 and CmMPK6 and temperature stress.
