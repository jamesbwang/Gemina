Isostructural compounds 1-3 are hybrid dimers that consist of two Ti-substituted Keggin-type polyoxoanions ( PW10Ti2O40) 7- and four Ln-3-Hpic coordination groups. The strong hydrogen bonds in 1-3 can make these dimers yield a 1D supramolecular chain. Compounds 4-6 are also dimers constructed from two lanthanide-substituted Keggin-type polyoxoanions ( PW11LnO39) 4- and four 4-Hpic ligands , which are further linked by two Ln-4-Hpic groups to form a bi-supporting structure. Then these subunits are joined together by strong hydrogen-bonding interactions between polyoxoanions and coordinated water molecules to produce a 2D supramolecular framework. All these compounds as heterogeneous Lewis acid-base catalysts show high activity and high selectivity for the cyanosilylation of different carbonyl compounds under solvent-free conditions , and can be recycled without any obvious inactivation.
