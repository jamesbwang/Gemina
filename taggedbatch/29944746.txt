 Although predominantly a disease of cattle , bovine viral diarrhoea<disease> virus ( BVDV) is known to infect other ruminant and camelid species such as sheep and alpacas. The aims of this study were to determine if BVDV-naive alpacas would become acutely infected and seroconvert to the predominant Australian strain of BVDV following co-mingling with a BVDV-1c persistently infected ( PI) heifer and to determine what , if any , clinical signs , haematological responses and selected biochemical changes occur with acute BVDV-1c infections in alpacas. A PI heifer and four alpacas co-mingled for 2 weeks. Weekly blood samples were collected and twice weekly clinical examinations were performed on the alpacas. Serum analysis by antibody ELISA indicated that all four alpacas were positive for BVDV-specific antibodies between 35 and 54 days after mixing with the BVDV-1c PI heifer. Viral antigen was detected by antigen ELISA in two alpacas on days 21 and 35 after initial mixing. In general , all the physical clinical parameters measured were normal. Serum biochemical and haematological analyses in two of the alpacas revealed marginally low sodium , chloride and elevated potassium concentrations , a lymphocytosis , monocytosis and a neutrophilia at some point during the study period in either one or both of the alpacas. This study showed that infection in Australian alpacas readily occurs when a BVDV-1c PI bovine co-mingles with naive alpacas and that acute<disease> infections<disease> are clinically mild and undetectable without serological testing.
