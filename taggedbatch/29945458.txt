 To assess the psychometric properties and feasibility of the Finnish translation of the measure of processes of care for adults ( MPOC-A) when used in an inpatient rehabilitation setting. A feasibility study. Inpatient rehabilitation settings. A total of 858 people with severe<symptom> neurological disabilities , musculoskeletal problems , and mental disorders were recruited to the study. The MPOC-A questionnaire is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 34 items in five-factorial domains. The construct validity of the translated questionnaire was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. To compare the fit of the model to the fit of the independent null-model Comparative Fit Index was used. Internal consistency for the total scale and subscales was calculated using Cronbach 's alpha reliability coefficient. A total of 554 people , mean age 52 years ( SD = 9) , participated in the study. Most of the responders had musculoskeletal problems ( n = 328 , 57 %). The respondents rated the client-centeredness in rehabilitation service as moderate ( m = 5.40 , SD = 0.81). The five-factor and the one-factor model fitted the data well according to all three indices. Internal consistency showed high reliability between the one-factor and five-factor models for all except one domain ( 0.49-0.93). The mean for Person Infit for the people with neurological disabilities was higher than for the other two groups ( m = 1.77 , SD = 1.32) indicating less predictable response patterns in this group. The results confirm the appropriate psychometric properties of the Finnish version of the MPOC-A , especially for people with musculoskeletal problems and those with mental health disorders.
