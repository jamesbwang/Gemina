 The following question remains open: what has the strongest impact on symptoms of depression<symptom> , experiencing multiple stressful events , being exposed to a specific stressful event , or having a maladaptive coping style? We conducted a cross-sectional survey with face-to-face interviews. Data from 2559 randomly-sampled adults living in Japan were analyzed. The participants were asked about stressful events ( 12 items) experienced in the previous month and their stress-coping strategies ( 16 items). Presence of symptoms of depression<symptom> was defined using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression<symptom> scale. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the associations of stressful events and stress-coping strategies with symptoms of depression<symptom>. The prevalence of symptoms of depression<symptom> increased with the number of stressful events. Eight stressful events and five stress-coping strategies were positively associated with symptoms of depression<symptom>. In the multiple logistic regression analysis for the items that showed a significant association with symptoms of depression<symptom> , two stressful events ( `` Health/illness of self '' and `` Trouble with family members '') and two stress-coping strategies ( `` Smoking '' and `` Bearing without action '') remained significantly associated with symptoms of depression<symptom>; however , the `` dose effect '' of the number of stressful events disappeared , suggesting that these stressful events and stress-coping strategies have a stronger association with symptoms of depression<symptom> compared with experiencing multiple stressful events. Since this study was cross-sectional in design , causal relationships could not be determined. Our findings may indicate the importance of focusing on types of stressful events and coping styles in developing preventive strategies for major depression<symptom>.
