 Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of miR-142-3p in breast cancer cells and the related mechanism. Sixty paired breast cancer tissues were collected and 60 breast tissues from patients with mammary hyperplasia<disease> served as the control group. The expression of miR-142-3p was examined using RT-qPCR methods; moreover , we also performed receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis to determine whether miR142-3p can distinguish breast cancer patients from the controls. Next , HMGA1 and FZD7 have been predicted as target genes of miR-142-3p , and the expressions of HMGA1 and FZD7 in breast cancer tissue and the control group were examined using RT-qPCR and western blot methods. miR-142-3p was significantly down-regulated in breast cancer tissue compared with the controls , and the levels of miR-142-3p was negatively correlated with the tumor size , degree of differentiation , and metastasis ( p < 0.01). Moreover , results of ROC curve analysis indicated that the expression of miR-142-3p can distinguish between patients with breast cancer and the control group ( AUC = 0.819 , 95 % CI , 0.756- 0.881). Furthermore , the expressions of HMGA1 and FZD7 were significantly up-regulated in patients with breast cancer compared with the controls. The level of miR-142-3p was negatively correlated with expressions of HMGA1 ( r = -0.3507 , p = 0.006) and FZD7 ( r = -0.3410 , p = 0.0077) in patients with breast cancer. Our results proved that miR-142-3p may serve as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer by suppressing the expression of oncogene HMGA1 and FZD7 , suggesting that miR-142-3p has the potential to become a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for the early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.
