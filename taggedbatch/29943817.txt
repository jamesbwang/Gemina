 The epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) is a key event associated with metastasis and dissemination in breast tumor pathogenesis. Promyelocytic leukemia<disease> ( PML) gene produces several isoforms due to alternative splicing; however , the biological function of each specific isoform has yet to be identified. In this study , we report a previously unknown role for PMLIV , the most intensely studied nuclear isoform , in transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β) signaling-associated EMT and migration in breast cancer. This study demonstrates that PMLIV overexpression promotes a more aggressive mesenchymal phenotype and increases the migration of MCF-7 cancer cells. This event is associated with activation of the TGF-β canonical signaling pathway through the induction of Smad2/3 phosphorylation and the translocation of phospho-Smad2/ 3 to the nucleus. In this study , we report a previously unknown role for PMLIV in TGF-β signaling-induced regulation of breast cancer-associated EMT and migration. Targeting this pathway may be therapeutically beneficial.
