 Antibiotics are the most common type of medication prescribed to children , including infants , in the Western world. While use of antibiotics has transformed previously lethal infections into relatively minor diseases , antibiotic treatments can have adverse effects as well. It has been shown in children , adults and animal models that antibiotics dramatically alter the gut microbial composition. Since the gut microbiota plays crucial roles in immunity , metabolism and endocrinology , the effects of antibiotics on the microbiota may lead to further health complications. In this review , we present an overview of the effects of antibiotics on the microbiome in children , and correlate them to long-lasting complications of obesity , behavior , allergies , autoimmunity and other diseases.
