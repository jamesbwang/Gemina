 Coupling of capillary electrophoresis to electrospray mass spectrometry still remains challenging and a topic of research to find the best interface regarding sensitivity , robustness , and ease of use. Here , a nanoflow sheath liquid interface for CE-ESI-MS is presented and compared to both a standard triple-tube sheath liquid and a porous-tip sheathless interface for three groups of analytes. The nanoflow sheath liquid interface with a separation capillary inserted into a glass emitter was initially characterized to facilitate optimization and method development. Implementation of a shut-off valve , syringe pump , and inline filter enabled easy handling and fast analyses , repeatable both in positive and negative modes ( intra-day RSD of 6.6 to 12.0 %). The same setup was used for sheathless interfacing by exchanging the emitter and using a porous etched tip separation capillary. Both nanoflow interfaces showed similar performance. Average peak areas using the nanoflow sheath liquid interface were a factor of 38 for 6 organic acids in negative mode , 114 and 36 for the light and heavy chain of a monoclonal antibody , and 13 higher for peptides in positive mode compared to the triple-tube interface. This first direct comparison of the three most common interfaces exhibits a strong improvement in sensitivity to the same extent for both nanoflow interfaces , where sheath liquid interfaces offer full flexibility in method development.
