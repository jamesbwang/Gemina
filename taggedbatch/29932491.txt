 In an attempt to develop new therapeutic treatments for colitis<disease> , we evaluated the effects of phenolic compounds and protein hydrolysates fractions of flaxseed on the in vitro production of pro-inflammatory mediators created by macrophages and on the course of experimental colitis<disease>. The anti-inflammatory effects of phenolic compounds ( Phi) and protein hydrolysates ( phr-FPH) from flaxseeds were studied in RAW264 .7 cells and in TNBS colitis<disease> model. We observed that incubation with either Phi or FPH resulted in lower levels of TNF-α and nitric oxide ( NO) in macrophages stimulated with LPS+IFN- γ. Both prophylactic and therapeutic treatments with Phi and phr-FPH , respectively , greatly contributed to the prevention of weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and colon inflammation<symptom> in colitic BALB/c mice. T cell proliferation , expansion of TH1 and TH17 cells , and pro-inflammatory cytokines were lower , whereas Treg cells were higher in spleen cell cultures from Phi-treated mice. In addition therapeutic phr-FPH treatment was able to reduce expansion of TH17 in splenic cell cultures. Confirming our initial hypothesis , the consumption of phenolic and protein compounds extracted from flaxseeds had a protective effect on TNBS-induced colitis<disease> , and may be useful in the control of other inflammatory disorders.
