 New vaccine design approaches would be greatly facilitated by a better understanding of the early systemic changes , and those that occur at the site of injection , responsible for the installation of a durable and oriented protective response. We performed a detailed characterization of very early infection and host response events following the intradermal administration of the modified vaccinia<disease><pathogen> virus<pathogen> Ankara as a live attenuated vaccine model in non-human primates. Integrated analysis of the data obtained from
