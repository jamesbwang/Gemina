Comparison of multifrequency bioelectrical impedance vs. dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry for assessing body composition changes after participation in a 10-week resistance training program. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis ( MF-BIA) to determine alterations in total and segmental body composition across a 10-week resistance training ( RT) program in comparison with the criterion reference dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA). Twenty-one young male volunteers ( mean ± SD; age = 22.9 ± 3.0 years; height = 175.5 ± 5.9 cm; body mass = 82.9 ± 13.6 kg; body mass index = 26.9 ± 3.6) performed an RT program that included exercises for all major muscle groups. Body composition was assessed using both methods before and after the intervention; change scores were determined by subtracting pre-test values from post-test values for percent body fat ( ( INCREMENT)) , fat mass ( ( INCREMENT) FM) , and fat-free mass ( ( INCREMENT) FFM). Mean changes were not significantly different when comparing MF-BIA with DXA for ( INCREMENT) ( -1.05 vs. -1.28 %) , ( INCREMENT) FM ( -1.13 vs. -1.19 kg) , and FFM ( 0.10 vs. 0.37 kg , respectively). Both methods showed strong agreement for ( INCREMENT) ( r = 0.75; standard error of the estimate ( SEE) = 1.15 %) , ( INCREMENT) FM ( r = 0.84; SEE 1.0 kg) , and ( INCREMENT) FFM ( r = 0.71; SEE of 1.5 kg). The 2 methods were poor predictors of each other in regards to changes in segmental measurements. Our data indicate that MF-BIA is an acceptable alternative for tracking changes in FM and FFM during a combined diet and exercise program in young , athletic men , but segmental lean mass measurements must be interpreted with circumspection.
