 De-noising is a crucial topic in Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI) which focuses on less loss of Magnetic Resonance ( MR) image information and details preservation during the noise suppression. Nowadays multiple-coil MRI system is preferred to single one due to its acceleration in the imaging process. Due to the fact that the model of noise in single-coil and multiple-coil MRI systems are different , the de-noising methods that mostly are adapted to single-coil MRI systems , do not work appropriately with multiple-coil one. The model of noise in single-coil MRI systems is Rician while in multiple-coil one ( if no subsampling occurs in k-space or GRAPPA reconstruction process is being done in the coils) , it obeys noncentral Chi ( nc-χ). In this paper , a new filtering method based on the Linear Minimum Mean Square Error ( LMMSE) estimator is proposed for multiple-coil MR Images ruined by nc-χ noise. In the presented method , to have an optimum similarity selection of voxels , the Bayesian Mean Square Error ( BMSE) criterion is used and proved for nc-χ noise model and also a nonlocal voxel selection methodology is proposed for nc-χ distribution. The results illustrate robust and accurate performance compared to the related state-of-the-art methods , either on ideal nc-χ images or GRAPPA reconstructed ones.
