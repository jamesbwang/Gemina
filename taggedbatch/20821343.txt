 Exogenous sex hormones may play a role in meningioma development and growth. Thus , transsexual patients being on long-standing hormone replacement therapy ( HRT) may be at particular risk for meningioma development and growth. Here we present two cases of two male-to-female transsexual patients taking HRT for an extended period of time with both patients requiring surgical treatment at our institution due to multiple growing meningiomas. The first patient was a 50-year-old genetic male ( male-to-female transsexual) who presented 7 years after an extensive sex-change operation due to progressive bitemporal visual defects. The patient had been on HRT for approximately a decade. Radiological examinations showed a total of four meningiomas , one being a large suprasellar meningioma causing the symptoms. Three of the four meningiomas were operated on , but the patient 's vision could not be saved. Immunohistochemical ( IH) analysis of the meningiomas showed both estrogen and progesterone receptor expression. The patient continued HRT and during follow-up regrowth of the meningiomas was noted. The second patient was a 48-year-old genetic male ( male-to-female transsexual) who had been on HRT for two decades and also presented due to left-sided visual loss. Radiological examination showed four meningiomas , one being a left-sided sinus cavernous meningioma causing compression of the visual apparatus. This patient had a previous normal head computerized tomography scan dating back 10 years before his current presentation. Three of the four meningiomas were operated on with a slight improvement in visual acuity. IH analysis showed positive progesterone receptor expression but negative estrogen receptor expression. Radiological screening may be justifiable for transsexual patients with a history of long-standing HRT and special focus should be paid to transsexual patients displaying new neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom> or those already diagnosed with a meningioma.
