 Multielement isotope ratio was assessed in fat and defatted ( protein) fillet of 130 rainbow<disease> trout , reared with feed incorporating a high or low fish content in 20 Italian farms , focusing on two northern Italian regions ( Friuli Venezia Giulia and Trentino). The aim was to investigate the ability of isotopic analysis to trace the geographical origin of trout , also according to the type of feed. The carbon , nitrogen and sulphur isotope ratios of feed and fillet were highly positively correlated both within each matrix ( feed or fillet) and between the two matrices and negatively correlated with the Î´
