 Linking individual task performance to preceding , regional brain activation is an ongoing goal of neuroscientific research. Recently , it could be shown that the activation and connectivity within large-scale brain networks prior to task onset influence performance levels. More specifically , prestimulus default mode network ( DMN) effects have been linked to performance levels in sensory near-threshold tasks , as well as cognitive tasks. However , it still remains uncertain how the DMN state preceding cognitive tasks affects performance levels when the period between task trials is long and flexible , allowing participants to engage in different cognitive states. We here investigated whether the prestimulus activation and within-network connectivity of the DMN are predictive of the correctness and speed of task performance levels on a cognitive ( match-to-sample) mental rotation task , employing a sparse event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) design. We found that prestimulus activation in the DMN predicted the speed of correct trials , with a higher amplitude preceding correct fast response trials compared to correct slow response trials. Moreover , we found higher connectivity within the DMN before incorrect trials compared to correct trials. These results indicate that pre-existing activation and connectivity states within the DMN influence task performance on cognitive tasks , both effecting the correctness and speed of task execution. The findings support existing theories and empirical work on relating mind-wandering and cognitive task performance to the DMN and expand these by establishing a relationship between the prestimulus DMN state and the speed of cognitive task performance.
