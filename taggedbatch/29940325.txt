 A number of observations have been reported on chemical capture and catalysis of anchoring materials for lithium-sulfur batteries. Here , we propose the design principles for the chemical functioned graphene as an anchor material to realize both strong chemical trapping and catalysis. Through the first principle , the periodic law is calculated from the theory. Seven different co-doping series were investigated , e.g. MN
