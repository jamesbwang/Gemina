 The transpsoas approach is a powerful tool in correcting adult spinal deformity secondary to the degenerative process. It may be used as a stand-alone construct or in combination with other approaches to correct both coronal and sagittal malalignment. Preoperative planning with careful analysis of full-length 36-in radiographs and an MRI of the lumbar spine is essential in determining the safety and feasibility of this approach. Ultimately the goals of deformity correction must be achieved , and lateral lumbar interbody fusion is a valuable tool that can aid in achieving these goals while minimizing perioperative morbidity.
