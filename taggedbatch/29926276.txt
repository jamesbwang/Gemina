 We have previously developed a polycaprolactone ( PCL) vascular graft with incorporated vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF). Functioning of the PCL/VEGF graft in rat circulatory system over 1 , 3 and 6 months after implantation into abdominal aorta was tested. Graft patency and formation of vascular wall elements were assessed histologically and by immunofluorescence staining for von Willebrand factor , CD31 , CD34 , and collagens I and IV and DAPI staining. Local application of VEGF promoted endothelialization and improved patency of the graft. The wall of the PCL/VEGF graft underwent remodeling due to active cellular infiltration and the extracellular matrix deposition.
