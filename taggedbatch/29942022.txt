 Ediacaran fossil communities consist of the oldest macroscopic eukaryotic organisms. Increased size ( height) is hypothesized to be driven by competition for water column resources , leading to vertical/epifaunal tiering and morphological innovations such as stems. Using spatial analyses , we find no correlation between tiering and resource competition , and that stemmed organisms are not tiered. Instead , we find that height is correlated with greater offspring dispersal , demonstrating the importance of colonization potential over resource competition.
