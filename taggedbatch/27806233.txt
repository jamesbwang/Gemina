 Fulminant myocarditis<disease> has been reported in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We present the first described case of acute immune-mediated myocarditis<disease> and myositis associated with durvalumab plus tremelimumab combination therapy. The patient was undergoing treatment for advanced endometrial cancer. A 75-year-old Caucasian female presented with difficulty ambulating due to neck protraction , imbalance , and increased shortness of breath with exertion 3 weeks after her first durvalumab and tremelimumab administration for advanced endometrial cancer. While the patient 's initial laboratory data showed an acute transaminitis and elevated creatine phosphokinase ( CPK) , consistent with myositis , she developed complete heart block and ventricular dysfunction , with elevated troponins. Endomyocardial biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of immune-mediated myocarditis<disease>. She was treated with high-dose steroids and mycophenolate mofetil , which led to eventual native conduction and left ventricular ejection fraction recovery. Upon discharge , she was titrated off of steroids over 8 weeks and her mycophenolate was subsequently stopped. A follow-up computed tomography scan revealed progression of metastatic disease. The patient remains alive using supplemental oxygen 3 months after admission. Durvalumab plus tremelimumab combination therapy can lead to fulminant immune-mediated myocarditis<disease>. This patient 's myocarditis<disease> was amenable to treatment with high-dose intravenous steroids and mycophenolate.
