 When learning rule-based categories , sufficient cognitive resources are needed to test hypotheses , maintain the currently active rule in working memory , update rules after feedback , and to select a new rule if necessary. Prior research has demonstrated that conjunctive rules are more complex than unidimensional rules and place greater demands on executive functions like working memory. In our study , event-related potentials ( ERPs) were recorded while participants performed a conjunctive rule-based category learning task with trial-by-trial feedback. In line with prior research , correct categorization responses resulted in a larger stimulus-locked late positive complex compared to incorrect responses , possibly indexing the updating of rule information in memory. Incorrect trials elicited a pronounced feedback-locked P300 elicited which suggested a disconnect between perception , and the rule-based strategy. We also examined the differential processing of stimuli that were able to be correctly classified by the suboptimal single-dimensional rule ( `` easy '' stimuli) versus those that could only be correctly classified by the optimal , conjunctive rule ( `` difficult '' stimuli). Among strong learners , a larger , late positive slow wave emerged for difficult compared with easy stimuli , suggesting differential processing of category items even though strong learners performed well on the conjunctive category set. Overall , the findings suggest that ERP combined with computational modelling can be used to better understand the cognitive processes involved in rule-based category learning.
