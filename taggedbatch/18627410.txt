 Little is known regarding consequences of climate change on riparian plant functional types ( PFTs) related to leaf traits , with putative domino effects on stream food webs , plausible even if the tipping point of stream-desiccation is not reached. We hypothesized that , as stream food-webs are highly dependent on riparian subsidies , climate change might alter PFTs to the point of weakening terrestrial-aquatic linkages. We conducted a gradient analysis to assess the relative effects of climate , soil and riparian physical characteristics on PFTs. If PFTs differ significantly in leaf traits and climate had major influences on them , we could assume space-for-time interchangeability forward in time to predict leaf traits changes , and consequences for stream food webs under future climate change scenarios. Results indicated a clear distinction in leaf traits among PFTs: woody deciduous plants showed leaf traits associated to high decomposability and nutritional value for invertebrate shredders compared to evergreen woody and giant graminoid groups. We found a prime role of climate predicting changes in abundance and diversity of PFTs: 1) a warming and precipitation-decline scenario , coupled with soil characteristics related to aridification , would have detrimental effects on deciduous plants , while fostering giant graminoids; 2) in a scenario of no precipitation-reduction in wetter areas , warming might promote the expansion of evergreen to the detriment of deciduous plants. In both scenarios the net outcome implies increasing recalcitrance of leaf litter inputs , potentially weakening terrestrial-aquatic linkages in headwater streams.
