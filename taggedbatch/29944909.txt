 Lactococcus<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> strains constitute one of the most important starter cultures for cheese production. In this study , a genome-wide analysis was performed including 68 available genomes of L.<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> group strains showing the existence of two species ( L.<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> and L.<pathogen> cremoris<pathogen>) and two biovars ( L.<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> biovar<pathogen>. diacetylactis and L.<pathogen> cremoris<pathogen> biovar<pathogen>. lactis<pathogen>). The proposed classification scheme revealed coherency among phenotypic ( through in silico and in vivo bacterial function profiling) , phylogenomic ( through maximum likelihood trees) and genomic ( using overall genome sequence-based parameters) approaches. Strain biodiversity for the industrial biovar<pathogen>. diacetylactis was also analyzed , finding they are formed by at least three variants with the CC1 clonal complex as the only one distributed worldwide. These findings and methodologies will help improve the selection of L.<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> group strains for industrial use as well as facilitate the interpretation of previous or future research studies on this diverse group of bacteria.
