 This work , as a proof of principle , presents a sensitive and selective electrochemical immunosensor for Zika-virus ( ZIKV)- protein detection using a functionalized interdigitated micro-electrode of gold ( IDE-Au) array. A miniaturized IDE-Au immunosensing chip was prepared via immobilization of ZIKV specific envelop protein antibody ( Zev-Abs) onto dithiobis ( succinimidyl propionate) i.e. , ( DTSP) functionalized IDE-Au ( electrode gap/width of 10 µm). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS) was performed to measure the electrical response of developed sensing chip as a function of ZIKV-protein concentrations. The results of EIS studies confirmed that sensing chip detected ZIKV-protein selectively and exhibited a detection range from 10 pM to 1 nM and a detection limit of 10 pM along with a high sensitivity of 12 kΩM
