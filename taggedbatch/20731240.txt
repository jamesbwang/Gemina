 Clinical laboratory workers face biohazard such as needlestick injury and occupational infection on a daily basis. In this study , we examined self-reported frequency of occupational infection and needlestick injury among the clinical laboratory workers in Al - Madinah , Saudi Arabia. A total of 234 clinical laboratory workers were recruited from private and government health sectors to answer a self-administered questionnaire that was prepared to achieve the aims of the study. The results showed that approximately 33 % of the sample had an experienced occupational infection while 24 % had experienced a needlestick injury. Approximately , 49 % reported that they always recap needle after use , whereas 15 % reported doing that most of the times. Occupational infection , needlestick injury and recapping needles after use were associated with lack of training on biosafety ( The frequency of occupational infection and needlestick injury among clinical laboratory workers in Al-Madinah is high. Interventions related to biosafety and infection control and the use of needlestick prevention devices might be useful in lowering such frequency.
