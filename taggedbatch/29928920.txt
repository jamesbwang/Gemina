 Innovative alternatives to control bacterial infections are need due to bacterial resistance rise. Antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs) have been considered as the new generation of antimicrobial agents. Based on the fact that AMPs are sequence-dependent , a linguistic model for designing AMPs was previously developed , considering AMPs as a formal language with a grammar ( patterns or motifs) and a vocabulary ( amino acids). Albeit promising , that model has been poorly exploited mainly because thousands of sequences need to be generated , and the outcome has high similarity to already known AMPs. Here we present Joker , an innovative algorithm that improves the application of the linguistic model for rational design of antimicrobial peptides. We modelled the AMPs as a card game , where Joker combines the cards in the hand ( patterns) with the cards in the table ( sequence templates) , generating a few variants. Our algorithm is capable of improving existing AMPs or even creating new AMPs from inactive peptides. A standalone version of Joker is available for download at < http://github.com/williamfp7/Joker > and requires a Linux 32-bit machine.
