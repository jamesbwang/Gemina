 We report on the virtual screening , synthesis , and biological evaluation of new furan derivatives targeting Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> salicylate synthase ( MbtI). A receptor-based virtual screening procedure was applied to screen the Enamine database , identifying two compounds , I and III , endowed with a good enzyme inhibitory activity. Considering the most active compound I as starting point for the development of novel MbtI inhibitors , we obtained new derivatives based on the furan scaffold. Among the SAR performed on this class , compound 1a emerged as the most potent MbtI inhibitor reported to date ( K
