 Despite the increased recognition of how neighborhood conditions bear on cognitive and academic outcomes , no studies have examined the influences of objective and subjective neighborhood indices on specific areas of cognitive functioning among youth living with perinatal HIV<pathogen> ( PHIV). In the United States ( US) , this is of particular concern as HIV<pathogen> has disproportionately affected African American youth living in economically disadvantaged and racially segregated communities. Thus , based on a longitudinal cohort study of psychosocial and behavioral health outcomes in 340 perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected ( PHEU) and PHIV youth residing in New<pathogen> York City , ages 9-16 years at enrollment , we analyzed data from baseline and multiple follow-up ( FU) quantitative interviews with youth and their primary caregivers , from when they were at least 13-years-old ( approximately 4-6 years post enrollment). We examined the association between baseline neighborhood indices ( 2000 US census data and caregiver 's perception of neighborhood stressors) and youth receptive language skills ( PPVT; Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test) at FU2 and FU3. Census data ( percentage of families in neighborhood living below the national poverty rate , median neighborhood household income , and percentage of residents professionally employed) were not independently associated with PPVT scores at both follow-ups. However , in the logistic regression model , the more caregivers perceived their neighborhood as stressful and subjected to violence , the stronger the relationship between census data indicators of low resource neighborhoods and lower PPVT scores for both groups. Findings support `` place-based '' policies and practices that alleviate caregiver experiences of neighborhood stressors which may contribute to improved cognitive outcomes for youth living with and affected by PHIV.
