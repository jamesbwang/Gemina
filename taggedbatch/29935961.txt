 To assess the feasibility of multi-component electrocorticography ( ECoG)- based mapping using `` wide-spectrum , intrinsic-brain activities '' for identifying the primary sensori-motor area ( S1-M1) by comparing that using electrical cortical stimulation ( ECS). We evaluated 14 epilepsy patients with 1514 subdural electrodes implantation covering the perirolandic cortices at Kyoto University Hospital between 2011 and 2016. We performed multi-component , ECoG-based mapping ( band-pass filter , 0.016-300/ 600 Hz) involving combined analyses of the single components: movement-related cortical potential ( < 0.5-1 Hz) , event-related synchronization ( 76-200 Hz) , and event-related de-synchronization ( 8-24 Hz) to identify the S1-M1. The feasibility of multi-component mapping was assessed through comparisons with single-component mapping and ECS. Among 54 functional areas evaluation , ECoG-based maps showed significantly higher rate of localization concordances with ECS maps when the three single-component maps were consistent than when those were inconsistent with each other ( p < 0.001 in motor , and p = 0.02 in sensory mappings). Multi-component mapping revealed high sensitivity ( 89-90 %) and specificity ( 94-97 %) as compared with ECS. Wide-spectrum , multi-component ECoG-based mapping is feasible , having high sensitivity/specificity relative to ECS. This safe ( non-stimulus) mapping strategy , alternative to ECS , would allow clinicians to rule in/out the possibility of brain function prior to resection surgery.
