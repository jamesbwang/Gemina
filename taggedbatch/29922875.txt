 To prevent leakage of pancreatic juice from the main pancreatic duct ( MPD) , complete external drainage appears to be the most effective technique. However , because this requires a pancreatic stent tube to be ligated with MPD , duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy ( PJ) is difficult. From our histopathological examination , a large amount of pancreatic juice is drained from the ducts other than MPD. This study aimed to evaluate our new conceptual technique of PJ after pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PD). We considered it important to drain pancreatic juice from the branch pancreatic ducts to the intestinal tract and to perform duct-to-mucosa PJ , while pancreatic juice from MPD is completely drained out of the body. We designed a technique that could simultaneously achieve these points. In our technique , which is based on conventional `` two-row '' anastomosis , a stent tube is fixed with MPD and its surrounding tissue by purse-string suture at the cut surface of the pancreas , and duct-to-mucosa PJ is concomitantly performed. Of 45 patients undergoing PD , 12 of soft pancreas underwent surgery with this technique. According to the classification of the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula<disease> , a Grade A PF was observed in four patients , whereas no patient had a Grade B or C PF. We propose our anastomotic technique that could simultaneously prevent PF and keep the pancreatic duct patent.
