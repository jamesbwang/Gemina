 The purpose of this study was to examine the experience of transition into the full-time faculty role among nurse educators who teach in associate degree nursing ( ADN) programs. As the nursing profession responds to both the nursing and faculty shortages , understanding the experience of the transition at the ADN level becomes important. Faculty roles and responsibilities differ among program types. A qualitative research design was used to explore the transition experience of 14 participants , identified through purposive sampling , who taught in ADN programs in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Themes that emerged include: a) difficulties , b) learning the role , c) embracing the role , d) the need for support , and e) personal experience of confidence and love of teaching. Findings suggest that role-specific orientation programs with a strong mentoring component are needed to ease the transition into the full-time faculty role at the ADN level of education.
