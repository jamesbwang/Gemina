 Factors associated with tobacco smoking are useful in designing tobacco control programs. To estimate the prevalence of and factors associated with tobacco smoking among long-distance drivers. A cross-sectional study. Stratified cluster sampling approach was used to select drivers based on if they received annual health screening ( AHS) or not ( non-AHS). We used a structured questionnaire to obtain information and weighted the resulting observations to derive population based estimates. Association between tobacco smoking and socio-demographic factors was explored in multivariate models. A total of 414 male drivers , with a mean age of 43.6 ( standard error 0.6) years were studied. Population weighted prevalence of current smoking was 18.9 % ( 95 % CI: 14.3-23.4) all drivers , 6.5 % ( 95 % CI: 2.6-10.4) of AHS drivers and 19.5 ( 95 % CI: 14.7-24.2) of non-AHS drivers ( p < 0.001). In multivariate models , having close friends that smoked ( OR = 6.36 , 95 % CI = 2.49- 16.20) cargo driving ( OR = 2.58 , 95 % CI = 1.29- 5.15) and lower education levels ( OR for post-secondary education vs. Primary education or less = 0.17 , 95 % CI = 0.04- 0.81) were associated with current smoking. Prevalence of tobacco smoking is higher among non-AHS compared to AHS drivers. Having close friends that smoked , cargo driving , and lower education levels were associated with current smoking.
