 We describe the synthesis , Langmuir-Blodgett ( LB) film formation , and photo-oxidation of an organic-inorganic hybrid block copolymer consisting of N-dodecyl acrylamide ( DDA) and silsesquioxane ( SQ) comonomers ( p ( DDA/SQ26)- b-pDDA). The copolymer was synthesized by reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization of DDA and SQ.. Higher monolayer stability at the air-water interface was confirmed for p ( DDA/SQ26)- b-pDDA. The p ( DDA/SQ26)- b-pDDA monolayer was deposited onto solid substrates with a monolayer thickness of 2.3 nm. The photo-oxidized SiO
