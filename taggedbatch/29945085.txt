 We previously reported Microcystin-LR ( MC-LR) could enter the hypothalamus , reduce the expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH) , and induce male reproductive barriers. However , the molecular mechanisms underlying in the hypothalamus have not been elucidated in detail. In this study , we further showed that MC-LR inhibited the synthesis of GnRH in GnRH neurons via activating protein kinase a ( PKA) , cAMP-response element binding protein ( Creb) , protein kinase c ( PKC) , nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-ÎºB) , extracellular regulated protein kinases ( Erk) and P38 protein , and thus resulted in the change of activity of transcriptional enhancers or suppressors such as Oct-1 , Otx-2 , Pbx1a , Dlx-2 , c-Jun and c-Fos. Following exposure , MC-LR-treated mice exhibited decreased GnRH level. Our data demonstrated that MC-LR can stimulate intracellular Ca
