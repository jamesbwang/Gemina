 Circular RNAs ( circRNAs) are highly expressed in the central nervous system and are involved in the regulation of physiological and pathophysiological processes. However , the potential role of circRNAs in stroke remains largely unknown. Here , using a circRNA microarray , we showed that circular RNA Hectd1 ( circHectd1) levels were significantly increased in ischemic brain tissues in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion ( tMCAO) mouse stroke models and further validated this finding in plasma samples from acute ischemic stroke ( AIS) patients. Knockdown of circHectd1 expression significantly decreased infarct areas , attenuated neuronal deficits , and ameliorated astrocyte activation in tMCAO mice. Mechanistically , circHECTD1 functions as an endogenous MIR142 ( microRNA 142) sponge to inhibit MIR142 activity , resulting in the inhibition of TIPARP ( TCDD inducible poly ( ADP-ribose) polymerase) expression with subsequent inhibition of astrocyte activation via macroautophagy/autophagy. Taken together , the results of our study indicate that circHECTD1 and its coupling mechanism are involved in cerebral ischemia , thus providing translational evidence that circHECTD1 can serve as a novel biomarker of and therapeutic target for stroke. 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; ACTB: actin beta; AIS: acute ischemic stroke; AS: primary mouse astrocytes; BECN1: beclin 1 , autophagy related; BMI: body mass index; circHECTD1: circRNA HECTD1; circRNAs: circular RNAs; CBF: cerebral blood flow; Con: control; DAPI: 4 ' ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ECA: external carotid artery; FISH: fluorescence in situ hybridization; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Gdna: genomic DNA; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein; GO: gene ontology; HDL: high-density lipoprotein; IOD: integrated optical density; LDL: low-density lipoprotein; LPA: lipoprotein ( a); MAP1LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MIR142: microRNA 142; mNSS: modified neurological severity scores; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; NIHSS: National Institute of Health Stoke Scale; OGD-R: oxygen glucose deprivation-reperfusion; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; PFA: paraformaldehyde; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TIPARP: TCDD inducible poly ( ADP-ribose) polymerase; tMCAO: transient middle cerebral artery occlusion; TTC: 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride; UTR: untranslated region; WT: wild type.
