 Modern size exclusion chromatography ( SEC) can be defined by the use of relatively small columns ( e.g. , 150 × 4.6 mm) packed with sub-3 μm particles , allowing a 3- to 5-fold increase in method throughput compared to that of conventional SEC. The quick success of the first sub-2 μm SEC column introduced in 2010 led to the development of numerous ultra-high performance ( UHP)- SEC columns for the analysis of therapeutic monoclonal antibody ( mAb)- based products. Aggregates also known as high-molecular-weight species ( HMWS) are indeed one of the most important critical quality attributes ( CQAs) of mAbs , as HMWS may decrease the product efficacy or cause immunogenicity effects. Therefore , the confident characterization of mAbs requires strong knowledge of not only modern SEC performance ( i.e. , selectivity and efficiency) but also the inherent limitations caused by non-specific interactions more likely to occur with complex antibody drug conjugates ( ADCs) and some commercial mAb products. This review discusses the importance of liquid chromatographic ( LC) instrumentation in order to exploit the full potential of modern SEC columns and current trends to hyphenate SEC to mass spectrometry ( MS). Recent applications for antibody-based products ( i.e. , mAbs , ADCs , Fc-Fusion proteins and bispecific antibodies) are presented. Finally , tips and tricks are provided to further optimize SEC separations and maintaining their performance over time with better understanding of unexpected SEC results.
