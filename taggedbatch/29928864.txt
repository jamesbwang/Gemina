 Opioids used for postoperative pain control after surgery have been associated with an increased risk of chronic opioid use. Hysterectomy is the most common major gynecologic procedure in the United States; however , we lack a data-driven definition of new persistent opioid use specific to hysterectomy. 1) Determine a data-driven definition of new persistent opioid use among opioid naïve women undergoing hysterectomy; 2) Determine the prevalence of and risk factors for new persistent opioid use. We used data from Optum Clinformatics that includes both medical and pharmacy data from a single national private health insurer. Hysterectomies performed from January 1 , 2011 to December 31 , 2014 were identified using Current Procedural Terminology and International Classification of Diseases , Ninth Revision codes. Inclusion criteria included: age ≤ 63 years at hysterectomy , no opioid fills for eight months preceding ( excluding the 30 days immediately prior) , and no additional surgical procedures within six months post-hysterectomy. The perioperative period was defined as 30 days prior to 14 days after hysterectomy. Number of opioid prescription fills , days supplied , and total oral morphine equivalents were analyzed to determine the distribution of opioid use in the perioperative and postoperative periods. We obtained demographics including age , race , educational level , and division of the country according to the U.S. Census Bureau and used International Classification of Diseases , Ninth Revision diagnosis codes to identify hysterectomy indications , surgical route , chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> disorders , depression/anxiety , and substance abuse. Bivariate analyses were used to compare persistent to non-persistent opioid users. A hierarchical logistic regression model controlling for regional variation was used to determine factors associated with new persistent opioid use following hysterectomy. 24,331 women were included in the analysis. `` New persistent opioid use '' was defined as: ≥ 2 opioid fills within six months of hysterectomy with ≥ 1 fill every three months , and either total oral morphine equivalent ≥ 1,150 or days ' supplied ≥ 39. Based on this definition , the prevalence of new persistent opioid use was 0.5 % ( N = 122). Median perioperative oral morphine equivalents ( OME) prescribed to those who became new persistent users was 437.5 mg ( IQR 200 , 750) compared to 225 mg ( IQR 150 , 300) for non-persistent users ( p < .0001). Factors independently associated with new persistent opioid use included: increasing age ( aOR 1.04 , 95 % CI 1.01-1.06 , p = .006) , black race ( ref: white , aOR 1.61 95 % CI 1.02-2.55 , p = .04) , gynecologic malignancy ( aOR 7.61 , 95 % CI 3.35-17.27 , p < .0001) , abdominal route ( aOR 3.61 , 95 % CI 2.03-6.43 , p < .0001) , depression/anxiety ( aOR 2.62 , 95 % CI 1.71-4.02 , p < .0001) , and preoperative opioid fill ( aOR 2.76 , 95 % CI 1.87-4.07 , p < .0001). C-statistic for this model is 0.74. Based on our definition , the prevalence of new persistent opioid use among opioid naïve women undergoing hysterectomy is low; however , two potentially modifiable risk factors are preoperative opioid prescription and abdominal route of surgery.
