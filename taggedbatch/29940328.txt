 The neuronal RNA-binding protein HuD is involved in synaptic plasticity and the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory. Previously , we have shown that HuD is upregulated after both spatial and addiction-associated forms of learning , such as conditioned place preference. However , what role HuD plays in non-drug dependent learning and memory is not fully understood. In order to elucidate the role that HuD plays in non-drug appetitive behavior , we assessed mice over-expressing HuD ( HuD
