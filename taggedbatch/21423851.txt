 Health care providers usually focus on index HIV-infected patients and seldom obtain information from their partners. We aimed to determine HIV-preventative measures among couples , the prevalence of HIV<pathogen> infection , and treatment outcomes of partners. This cross-sectional study was conducted in two hospital settings , a university hospital in Bangkok and a general hospital in northeastern Thailand , from January 2011-October 2015. Factors associated with serodiscordant relationships were determined by logistic regression. A total of 393 couples were enrolled for analysis; 156 ( 39.7 %) were serodiscordant. The median relationship duration of serodiscordant couples was shorter than that of seroconcordant couples ( 6.4 years vs 11.6 years , p < 0.001). Of 237 HIV-infected partners , 17.7 % had AIDS-defining illness , the median nadir CD4 count ( interquartile range) was 240 ( 96-427) cells/mm3 , 83.5 % received antiretroviral therapy ( ART) , 98.3 % had adherence > 95 % , 90.3 % had undetectable HIV<pathogen> RNA , and 22.9 % had a prior history of treatment failure. There was no significant difference in condom usage in the prior 30 days between serodiscordant and seroconcordant couples. Factors of index HIV-infected patients associated with serodiscordant relationships were younger age ( odds ratio ( OR) 1.04 per 5 years; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.01-1.06) , receiving care at the general hospital ( OR 1.73; 95 % CI 1.08-2.78) , a shorter duration of relationship ( OR 1.04 per year; 95 % CI 1.01-1.07) , a higher nadir CD4 count ( OR 1.06 per 50 cells/mm3; 95 % CI 1.1-1.13) , and not receiving a protease inhibitor-based regimen ( OR 2.04; 95 % CI 1.06-3.96). A high number of serodiscordant couples was determined. Partners ' information should be retrieved as a holistic approach. Interventions for minimizing HIV<pathogen> transmission within serodiscordant couples should be evaluated and implemented.
