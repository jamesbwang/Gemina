 International guidelines recommend the use of item based scales for the assessment of pain and sedation. In our previous study , the implementation of the Neonatal Pain Agitation and Sedation Scale ( N-PASS) , and the associated systematic assessment and treatment of pain and sedation reduced pain and over-sedation in our intervention group , but lead to a significant increase of individual opiate exposure. This increased opiate exposure was not associated with impaired<symptom> motor and mental development at one year of age. As one-year follow-up is not necessarily representative for future outcomes , we retested our sample at three years of age. Fifty-three patients after ( intervention group) and 61 before implementation ( control group) of the N-PASS and the Vienna Protocol for the Management of Neonatal Pain and Sedation ( VPNPS) , were compared for motor , mental and behavioural development at three-years follow-up using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Cumulative opiate exposure was not associated with mental ( p = .31) and motor ( p = .20) problems when controlling for other important medical conditions , but was associated to lower behavioural scores ( p = .007). No statistically significant differences were found with regard to mental ( p = .65) , psychomotor ( p = .12) and behavioural ( p = .61) development before and after the implementation of the N-PASS and the VPNPS. Implementing a neonatal pain and sedation protocol increased opiate exposure without affecting neurodevelopmental outcome at three-years of age.
