 Implant site preparation may be adjusted to achieve the maximum possible primary stability. The aim of this investigation was to study the relation among bone-to-implant contact at insertion , bone density , and implant primary stability intra-operatively measured by a torque-measuring implant motor , when implant sites were undersized or tapped. Undersized ( n = 14) , standard ( n = 13) , and tapped ( n = 13) implant sites were prepared on 9 segments of bovine ribs. After measuring bone density using the implant motor , 40 implants were placed , and their primary stability assessed by measuring the integral of the torque-depth insertion curve. Bovine ribs were then processed histologically , the bone-to-implant contact measured and statistically correlated to bone density and the integral. Bone-to-implant contact and the integral of the torque-depth curve were significantly greater for undersized sites than tapped sites. Moreover , a correlation between bone to implant contact , the integral and bone density was found under all preparation conditions. The slope of the bone-to-implant/density and integral/density lines was significantly greater for undersized sites , while those corresponding to standard prepared and tapped sites did not differ significantly. The integral of the torque-depth curve provided reliable information about bone-to-implant contact and primary implant stability even in tapped or undersized sites. The linear relations found among the parameters suggests a connection between extent and modality of undersizing and the corresponding increase of the integral and , consequently , of primary stability. These results might help the physician determine the extent of undersizing needed to achieve the proper implant primary stability , according to the planned loading protocol.
