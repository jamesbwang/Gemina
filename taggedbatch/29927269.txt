 Perceived slant has often been characterized as a component of 3D shape perception for polyhedral objects. Like 3D shape , slant is often perceived inaccurately. Lind , Lee , Mazanowski , Kountouriotis , and Bingham ( 2014) found that 3D shape was perceived accurately with perspective changes ≥ 45 °. We now similarly tested perception of 3D slant. To account for their results , Lind et al. ( 2014) developed a bootstrap model based on the assumption that optical information yields perception of 3D relief structure then used with large perspective changes to bootstrap to perception of 3D Euclidean structure. However , slant perception usually entails planar surfaces and structure-from-motion fails in the absence of noncoplanar points. Nevertheless , the displays in Lind et al. ( 2014) included stereomotion in addition to monocular optical flow. Because stereomotion is higher order , the bootstrap model might apply in the case of strictly planar surfaces. We investigated whether stereomotion , monocular structure-from-motion ( SFM) , or the combination of the two would yield accurate 3D slant perception with large continuous perspective change. In Experiment 1 , we found that judgments of slant were inaccurate in all information conditions. In Experiment 2 , we added noncoplanar structure to the surfaces. We found that judgments in the monocular SFM and combined conditions now became correct once perspective changes were ≥ 45 ° , replicating the results of Lind et al. ( 2014) and supporting the bootstrap model. In short , we found that noncoplanar structure was required to enable accurate perception of 3D slant with sufficiently large perspective changes.
