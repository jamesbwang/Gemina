 The role of the type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein B7-H3 is controversial in tumorigenesis; thus , a better clarification of its involvement in cancer is crucial. In the present study , 79.3 % of cervical cancer samples were found to be B7-H3 positive and the expression of B7-H3 was positively correlated with the clinical features of the samples. Silencing B7-H3 using small interfering RNA or blocking it with intracellular ScFv attenuated the malignancy of HeLa cells. By pull-down assay and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in HeLa cells , the glycolytic enzyme ENO1 was found to interact with B7-H3. Subsequently , the involvement of B7-H3 in glycolysis was investigated. We observed decreases in the levels of ATP and lactate , as well as c-Myc and lactate dehydrogenase A , upon B7-H3 downregulation in HeLa cells. The results of the present study provide evidence for B7-H3 mediating tumor glycolysis.
