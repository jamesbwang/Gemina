 Parametric separation of carbon nanotubes , especially based on their length is a challenge for a number of nano-tech researchers. We demonstrate a method to combine bio-conjugation , SDS-PAGE , and silver staining in order to separate carbon nanotubes on the basis of length. Egg-white lysozyme , conjugated covalently onto the single-walled carbon nanotubes surfaces using carbodiimide method. The proposed conjugation of a biomolecule onto the carbon nanotubes surfaces is a novel idea and a significant step forward for creating an indicator for length-based carbon nanotubes separation. The conjugation step was followed by SDS-PAGE and the nanotube fragments were precisely visualized using silver staining. This high precision , inexpensive , rapid and simple separation method obviates the need for centrifugation , additional chemical analyses , and expensive spectroscopic techniques such as Raman spectroscopy to visualize carbon nanotube bands. In this method , we measured the length of nanotubes using different image analysis techniques which is based on a simplified hydrodynamic model. The method has high precision and resolution and is effective in separating the nanotubes by length which would be a valuable quality control tool for the manufacture of carbon nanotubes of specific lengths in bulk quantities. To this end , we were also able to measure the carbon nanotubes of different length , produced from different sonication time intervals.
