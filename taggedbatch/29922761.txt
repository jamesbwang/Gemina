 Sofosbuvir is a hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) NS5B polymerase inhibitor. The objective of this study was to explore the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir for HCV<pathogen> genotype ( GT) 2 and 3 infected patients. We searched randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) which analyzed the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir-containing regimens for HCV<pathogen> GT 2/3 infected patients and collected data. The endpoints were sustained virological response 12- and 24-weeks after the cessation of therapy ( SVR12 and SVR24) , the adverse events ( AEs) and the severe adverse events ( SAEs). Eighteen trials comprising 2,975 HCV<pathogen> GT 2/3 infected patients were included. The pooled estimate SVR12 , SVR24 , AEs and SAEs rates were 84.6 % ( 95 % CI: 83.2-86.0) , 83.7 % ( 95 % CI: 82.0-85.2) , 83.8 ( 95 % CI: 82.3-85.3) and 3.9 ( 95 % CI: 3.2-4.8). The SVR12 rate of sofosbuvir-containing regimens for HCV<pathogen> GT 2 infection was higher than that for HCV<pathogen> GT 3 infection ( 95.7 % vs. 80.8 %). The sofosbuvir combined with velpatasvir ( with or without ribavirin) regimen presented a higher SVR12 rate and lower AEs rate than the sofosbuvir combined with ribavirin ( with or without peg-IFN) regimen ( 94.9 % vs. 80.7 % for SVR12 rate; 69.3 % vs. 87.7 % for AEs rate). The sofosbuvir-containing regimens in patients with HCV<pathogen> GT 2 infection have better efficacy than in patients with HCV<pathogen> GT 3 infection.
