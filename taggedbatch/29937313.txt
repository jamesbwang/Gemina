 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) is a respiratory disorder responsible for a high mortality and disability. People older than 65 years are more commonly affected than younger people and tend to present with more symptoms and a greater level of disability. Non-pharmacological interventions play an important role in the management of all patients with COPD and this is particularly true in the elderly. Given the improvement in quality of life and risk of hospitalization , smoking cessation should be promoted to patients of all ages. Increased physical activity is associated with reduced respiratory<symptom> symptoms<symptom>. Tests such as the `` Short Physical Performance Battery '' can be useful in frailer older people with COPD , while walking tests such as the 6-minute walk test are used as an assessment before pulmonary rehabilitation. Increased physical activity should be combined with nutritional management. Screening for undernutrition by questionnaire , body mass index and albumin quantification is recommended in the elderly. In case of undernutrition , oral supplementation seems to reduce the risk of re-admission. All these measures must be included in an education program adapted to the elderly comorbidities ( hearing loss , isolation...).
