 Four new dimeric phthalides , angesinenolides C-F ( 1-4) , along with three known ones , were isolated from the roots of Angelica sinensis<pathogen>. Their structures were determined by means of HRMS and NMR experiments. The structures of compounds 1 and 3 were confirmed using X-ray crystallographic data. All isolated compounds were tested for activities on the inhibition of COX-2 enzyme in vitro. Compounds 1-6 exhibited inhibitory activity against COX-2 with IC
