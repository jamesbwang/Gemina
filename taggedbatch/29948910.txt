 This study deals with synthesis of chromium nanoparticles ( CrNPs) from potassium dichromate using the aqueous extract of Allium sativum. They were characterized through UV-VIS light , FE-SEM , EDX , XRD , and FT-IR , which revealed uniform , mono-dispersive , and highly stable CrNPs of 31-64-nm size. The Artemia nauplii was enriched with 4.94 mg/L of CrNPs ( 24-h LC
