 Cushing 's syndrome<disease><symptom> , a potentially lethal disorder characterized by endogenous hypercortisolism , may be difficult to recognize , especially when it is mild and the presenting features are common in the general population. However , there is a need to identify the condition at an early stage , as it tends to progress , accruing additional morbidity and increasing mortality rates. Once a clinical suspicion is raised , screening tests involve timed measurement of urine , serum or salivary cortisol at baseline or after administration of dexamethasone , 1 mg. Each test has caveats , so that the choice of tests must be individualized for each patient. Once the diagnosis is established , and the cause is determined , surgical resection of abnormal tumor/tissue is the optimal treatment. When this can not be achieved , medical treatment ( or bilateral adrenalectomy) must be used to normalize cortisol production. Recent updates in screening for and treating Cushing 's syndrome<disease><symptom> are reviewed here.
