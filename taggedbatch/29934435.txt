 The dynamic interchange between monomeric globular actin ( G-actin) and polymeric filamentous actin filaments ( F-actin) is fundamental and essential to many cellular processes including cytokinesis and maintenance of genomic stability. Here we report that the long non-coding RNA LNC CRYBG3 directly binds G-actin to inhibit its polymerization and formation of contractile rings , resulting in M-Phase cell arrest. Knockdown of LNC CRYBG3 in tumor cells enhanced their malignant phenotypes. Nucleotide sequence 228-237 of the full-length LNC CRYBG3 and the ser14 domain of beta-actin are essential for their interaction , and mutation of either of these sites abrogated binding of LNC CRYBG3 to G-actin. Binding of LNC CRYBG3 to G-actin blocked nuclear localization of MAL , which consequently kept serum response factor ( SRF) away from the promoter region of several immediate early genes , including JUNB and Arp3 , which are necessary for cellular proliferation , tumor growth , adhesion , movement , and metastasis. These findings reveal a novel lncRNA-actin-MAL-SRF pathway and highlight LNC CRYBG3 as a means to block cytokinesis and treat cancer by targeting the actin cytoskeleton.
