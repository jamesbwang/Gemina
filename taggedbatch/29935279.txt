 Individual variation in coping with environmental challenges is a well-known phenomenon across vertebrates , including teleost fish. Dopamine is the major transmitter in the brain reward networks , and important for motivational processes and stress coping. Functions of the endogenous opioid system are not well studied in teleosts. However , in mammals the activity in the brain reward networks is regulated by the endogenous opioid system. This study aimed at investigating if there was a correlation between risk-taking behavior and the expression of dopamine and opioid receptors in the zebrafish ( Danio<pathogen> rerio<pathogen>) brain. Risk-taking behavior was assessed in a novel tank diving test , and the most extreme high risk taking , i.e. bold , and low risk taking , i.e. shy , fish were sampled for qPCR analysis of whole brain gene expression. The expression analysis showed a significantly higher expression of the dopamine D2 receptors ( drd2a and drd2b) and the delta opioid receptor ( DOR; oprd1b) in bold compared to shy fish. Besides reward and reinforcing properties , DORs are also involved in emotional responses. Dopamine D2 receptors are believed to be important for active stress coping in rodents , and taken together the results of the current study suggest similar functions in zebrafish. However , additional experiments are required to clarify how dopamine and opioid receptor activation affect behavior and stress coping in this species.
