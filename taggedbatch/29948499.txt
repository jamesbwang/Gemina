 Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada ( VKH) disease is a primary autoimmune granulomatous choroiditis that begins in the choroidal stroma. The aim of this review was to gather a body of evidence for the concept of a window of therapeutic opportunity , defined as a time interval following initial-onset disease during which adequate treatment will substantially modify the disease outcome and possibly even lead to cure , similar to what has been described for rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom>. We reviewed the literature and consulted leading experts in VKH disease to determine the consensus for the notion of a therapeutic window of opportunity in VKH disease. We found a substantial body of evidence in the literature that a therapeutic window of opportunity exists for initial-onset acute uveitis associated with VKH disease. The disease outcome can be substantially improved if dual systemic steroidal and non-steroidal immunosuppressants are given within 2-3 weeks of the onset of initial VKH disease , avoiding evolution to chronic<disease> disease<disease> and development of `` sunset glow fundus. '' Several studies additionally report series in which the disease could be cured , using such an approach. There is substantial evidence for a therapeutic window of opportunity in initial-onset acute VKH disease. Timely and adequate treatment led to substantial improvement of disease outcome and prevented chronic evolution and `` sunset glow fundus , '' and very early treatment led to the cure after discontinuation of therapy in several series , likely due to the fact that the choroid is the sole origin of inflammation<symptom> in VKH disease.
