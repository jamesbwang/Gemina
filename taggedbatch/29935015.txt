 A GPU-based Monte Carlo software ( MCtet) was developed to calculate the light propagation in arbitrarily shaped objects , like a human tooth , represented by a tetrahedral mesh. A unique feature of MCtet is a concept to realize different kinds of light-sources illuminating the complex-shaped surface of an object , for which no preprocessing step is needed. With this concept , it is also possible to consider photons leaving a turbid media and reentering again in case of a concave object. The correct implementation was shown by comparison with five other Monte Carlo software packages. A hundredfold acceleration compared with central processing units-based programs was found. MCtet can simulate anisotropic light propagation , e.g. , by accounting for scattering at cylindrical structures. The important influence of the anisotropic light propagation , caused , e.g. , by the tubules in human dentin , is shown for the transmission spectrum through a tooth. It was found that the sensitivity to a change in the oxygen saturation inside the pulp for transmission spectra is much larger if the tubules are considered. Another `` light guiding '' effect based on a combination of a low scattering and a high refractive index in enamel is described.
