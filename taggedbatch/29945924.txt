 This review summarises the available data on the disadvantages of the 7-day contraceptive-free interval ( CFI) of combined oral contraceptives ( COCs) , in contrast to shorter CFIs or continuous use- including flexible regimens- and provides recommendations for practice. Relevant papers were identified by Medline and PubMed. The final reference list was generated on the basis of relevance to the review , with priority given to systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials. There is considerable inter- and intra-individual variation in the absorption and metabolism of COCs. Even with perfect use , the loss of endocrine suppression during the standard 7-day CFI allows follicular development with the risk of escape ovulation in a vulnerable minority. This risk increases in typical users whenever the CFI is prolonged: late restarts are a common reason for pill omissions. Shortening or eliminating the CFI improves contraceptive efficacy using the lowest doses available , without evidence to date of compromised safety. There is no scientific evidence to support a 7-day CFI and it should be replaced either by a continuous flexible regimen , or extended regimens with a shortened CFI , prescribed first-line. In women preferring a monthly ` bleed ' , a 4-day CFI similarly provides a greater safety margin when pills are omitted.
