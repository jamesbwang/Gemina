 Recurrent pregnancy loss ( RPL) affects close to 1 % of couples; however , the etiology is known in only about 50 % of the cases. Recent studies show that autoimmune dysregulation is a probable cause of RPL , which in some cases may be overlooked. In order for a pregnancy to proceed to term , early modulation of immunologic response is required to induce tolerance to the semi-allogenic fetus. Certain subsets of both the innate and adaptive immune responses play a role in the induction of fetomaternal tolerance. A relatively predominant T-cell helper ( Th) 2 and T regulatory ( Treg) cell population seem to favor a better pregnancy outcome , whereas Th1 and Th17 cell populations appear to have an opposite effect. Lately , the role of vitamin D in the modulation of immune response was established. Vitamin D has been shown to promote a more favorable environment for pregnancy through various mechanisms , such as enhancement of the shift toward Th2 cells and regulation of immune cell differentiation and cytokine secretion. Therefore , it seems that vitamin D deficiency sways the balance<symptom> toward a worse outcome and may play a part in recurrent pregnancy loss. This review sheds light on the immunologic changes , which occur in early pregnancy and the regulatory role vitamin D has in the maintenance of this delicate balance<symptom>.
