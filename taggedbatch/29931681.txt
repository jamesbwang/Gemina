 Bee pollen , collected by honey bees , contains a substantial amount of nutrients and has a high nutritive value. However , a high level of nutrients can be difficult to be digested and absorbed due to the complex wall of bee pollen. We observed that amino acids were mostly distributed inside cell wall of lotus bee pollen , rape bee pollen , apricot bee pollen , wuweizi bee pollen and camellia bee pollen , using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry ( TOF-SIMS). Thus , five species of bee pollen were wall-disrupted with a combination of ultrasonication and high shear technique ( US-HS). After the treatment , bee pollen walls were entirely broken into fragments , and a high number of nutrients were released. The contents of amino acids , fatty acids , protein , crude fat , reducing sugar , Î²-carotene , calcium , iron , zinc , selenium obviously increased after wall-disruption. Overall , our study demonstrates that US-HS can disrupt bee pollen wall to release nutrients. Therefore , further studies are being conducted to compare the digestibility and absorptivity of pollen nutrients before and after wall-disruption. Additionally , TOF-SIMS seems to be a reliable mapping technique for determining the distribution of food ingredients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
