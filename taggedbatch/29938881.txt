 Automated audio recording offers a powerful tool for acoustic monitoring schemes of bird , bat , frog and other vocal organisms , but the lack of automated species identification methods has made it difficult to fully utilise such data. We developed Animal Sound<symptom> Identifier ( ASI) , a MATLAB software that performs probabilistic classification of species occurrences from field recordings. Unlike most previous approaches , ASI locates training data directly from the field recordings and thus avoids the need of pre-defined reference libraries. We apply ASI to a case study on Amazonian birds , in which we classify the vocalisations of 14 species in 194 504 one-minute audio segments using in total two weeks of expert time to construct , parameterise , and validate the classification models. We compare the classification performance of ASI ( with training templates extracted automatically from field data) to that of monitoR ( with training templates extracted manually from the Xeno-Canto database) , the results showing ASI to have substantially higher recall and precision rates.
