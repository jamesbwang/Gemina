 We aimed to ascertain whether waist circumference ( WC) is associated with risk of colorectal neoplasia ( CRN) , independent of body mass index ( BMI). Although several studies have reported the association between abdominal obesity , measured by WC , and CRN , it remains unclear whether their association is biased by BMI. A cross-sectional study was performed on 154,552 asymptomatic examinees who underwent colonoscopy for a health check-up. The mean age was 42.6 years , and the proportion of males was 65.2 %. The prevalence rate of CRN in subjects in WC quartiles 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 was 15.6 % , 18.1 % , 20.4 % , and 22.0 % among men and 7.8 % , 9.4 % , 12.2 % , and 15.8 % among women , respectively. WC and BMI were independent risk factors for overall CRN and nonadvanced CRN in both men and women. In men , the association of BMI with advanced CRN was attenuated to null after adjusting for WC ( Q2 , Q3 , and Q4 vs. Q1; odds ratios ( 95 % confidence intervals) , 0.93 ( 0.79-1.10) , 0.85 ( 0.71-1.03) , and 0.99 ( 0.80-1.22) , respectively; Ptrend = 0.822) , whereas the association of WC with advanced CRN significantly persisted even after adjusting for BMI ( Q2 , Q3 , and Q4 vs. Q1; 1.20 ( 1.02-1.42) , 1.45 ( 1.20-1.75) , and 1.64 ( 1.32-2.04) , respectively; Ptrend < 0.001). In women , neither WC nor BMI was associated with the risk of advanced CRN. Abdominal obesity is associated with an increased risk of advanced CRN , independent of overall obesity ( BMI) in men. Our findings suggest that abdominal obesity is more strongly predictive of advanced CRN than overall obesity in men.
