 The influenza<pathogen><disease> epidemic of 1918 represented the greatest failure of medical science in the 20th century. Fortunately , research throughout subsequent years has been making amends. Some studies have applied RT-PCR to the tissue samples from that time , whereas others have reconstructed the pathogen in its virulent state. But the resurrection of the 1918 influenza<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> leaves questions unanswered: although more virulent than contemporary H1N1<pathogen> epidemic viruses in animal models , this increased virulence of the 1918 influenza<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> is not sufficient to have been the sole cause of the high mortality rates recorded in humans during the epidemic. Thus , other hypotheses have been investigated. The immune history of the different age groups exposed at the time to the pandemic virus could be a factor , and the notion of original antigenic sin provides an explanation for the unusual pattern of deaths. The presence , or absence , of a cytokine storm in the lungs of young adults might also be involved. The time and location that the 1918 influenza<pathogen><disease> pandemic first emerged from its avian reservoir is contentious , with arguments for China , Europe , and the USA , at various dates. Novel vaccines were tested during 1918 , which are the precursors of the universal influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccines that might offer protection in a future pandemic.
