 Although hypothyroidism is associated with many comorbidities , the evidence for its association with all-cause mortality in older adults is limited. To evaluate the association between hypothyroidism and all-cause mortality in older adults. Population-based retrospective cohort study. National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. After 1:10 age/sex/index year matching , 2029 patients aged â‰¥ 65 years who received a new diagnosis of hypothyroidism between 2001 and 2011 , and 20290 patients without hypothyroidism or other thyroid diseases , were included in the hypothyroidism and non-hypothyroidism cohorts respectively. All-cause mortality was defined as the primary outcome. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate the hazard ratios ( HRs) of mortality. To further evaluate the effect of thyroxine replacement therapy ( TRT) on mortality , we divided patients with hypothyroidism into two groups: patients who received TRT and those who did not. Hypothyroidism was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality ( adjusted HR ( aHR) = 1.82 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.68-1.98 , p < 0.001). Patients with hypothyroidism who received TRT had a lower risk of mortality than patients who did not receive TRT ( aHR = 0.57 , 95 % CI = 0.49-0.66 , p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained after further propensity score matching , in age- , sex- , and comorbidity-stratified analyses. Hypothyroidism was independently associated with increased all-cause mortality in older adults. In patients with hypothyroidism , TRT was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality.
