 The analysis of sequence conservation patterns has been widely utilized to identify functionally important ( catalytic and ligand-binding) protein residues for over a half-century. Despite decades of development , on average state-of-the-art non-template-based functional residue prediction methods must predict ∼ 25 % of a protein 's total residues to correctly identify half of the protein 's functional site residues. The overwhelming proportion of false positives results in reported `` F-Scores '' of ∼ 0.3. We investigated the limits of current approaches , focusing on the so-far neglected impact of the specific choice of homologs included in multiple sequence alignments ( MSAs). The limits of conservation-based functional residue prediction were explored by surveying the binding sites of 1,023 proteins. A straightforward conservation analysis of MSAs composed of randomly selected homologs sampled from a PSI-BLAST search achieves average F-Scores of ∼ 0.3 , a performance matching that reported by state-of-the-art methods , which often consider additional features for the prediction in a machine learning setting. Interestingly , we found that a simple combinatorial MSA sampling algorithm will in almost every case produce an MSA with an optimal set of homologs whose conservation analysis reaches average F-Scores of ∼ 0.6 , doubling state-of-the-art performance. We also show that this is nearly at the theoretical limit of possible performance given the agreement between different binding site definitions. Additionally , we showcase the progress in this direction made by Selection of Alignment by Maximal Mutual Information ( SAMMI) , an information-theory-based approach to identifying biologically informative MSAs. This work highlights the importance and the unused potential of optimally composed MSAs for conservation analysis. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
