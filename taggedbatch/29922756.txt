. The video capsule endoscopy ( VCE) is an accurate and validated tool to investigate the entire small bowel mucosa , but VCE recordings interpretation by the gastroenterologist is time-consuming. A pre-reading of VCE recordings by an expert nurse could be accurate and cost saving. We assessed the concordance between nurses and gastroenterologists in detecting lesions<symptom> on VCE examinations. This was a prospective study enrolling consecutive patients who had undergone VCE in clinical practice. Two trained nurses and two expert gastroenterologists participated in the study. At VCE pre-reading the nurses selected any abnormalities , saved them as `` thumbnails '' and classified the detected lesions<symptom> as a vascular abnormality , ulcerative lesion<symptom> , polyp , tumor mass , and unclassified lesion<symptom>. Then , the gastroenterologist evaluated and interpreted the selected lesions<symptom> and , successively , reviewed the entire video for potential missed lesions<symptom>. The time for VCE evaluation was recorded. A total of 95 VCE procedures performed on consecutive patients ( M/F: 47/48; mean age: 63 +/- 12 years , range: 27-86 years) were evaluated. Overall , the nurses detected at least one lesion<symptom> in 54 ( 56.8 %) patients. There was total agreement between nurses and gastroenterologists , no missing lesions<symptom> being discovered at a second look of the entire VCE recording by the physician. The pre-reading procedure by nurse allowed a time reduction of medical evaluation from 49 ( 33-69) to 10 ( 8-16) minutes ( difference: -79.6 %). Our data suggest that trained nurses can accurately identify and select relevant lesions<symptom> in thumbnails that subsequently were faster reviewed by the gastroenterologist for a final diagnosis. This could significantly reduce the cost of VCE procedure.
