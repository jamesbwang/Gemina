 The pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1 ( PHLPP1) specifically regulates phospho-Ser473 of protein kinase B ( PKB , Akt) opposing cell survival during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R). Previous studies demonstrated PHLPP1 expression level was controlled by several mechanisms. However , the regulation mechanism of cardiac PHLPP1 expression following myocardial I/R remains unknown. The current study utilized the mouse model of myocardial I/R injury in vivo and the neonatal rat ventricular myocytes ( NRVMs) of hypoxia/reoxygenation ( H/R) injury in vitro. Expression of PHLPP1 , nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB) and pNF-κB were determined by western blot. The expression of PHLPP1 and translocation of NF-κB was assessed by immunofluorescence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP) assay was used to detect the binding of NF-κB to the promoter region of phlpp1 gene. Myocardial I/R had no effect on cardiac PHLPP1 expression following I/R ( 30 min/2 h) but decreased after 4 h reperfusion. In vitro , H/R ( 4 h/1 h) and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha ( TNF-α)- stimulation resulted in upregulation of PHLPP1 in NRVMs , which was blocked with etanercept. Yet , H These results implicated that TNF-α involved in cardiac PHLPP1 upregulation during reoxygenation , which was mediated by NF-κB transcriptional activity.
