 Emotion expression is a key part of trial advocacy. Attorneys are advised to gain credibility with juries by demonstrating conviction through anger expression. In 3 experiments , we tested whether expressing anger in court makes attorneys more effective and whether this depends on their gender. We randomly assigned participants ( n = 120 undergraduates) to view a male or female attorney presenting the same closing argument in either a neutral or angry tone ( Experiment 1). They reported their impressions of the attorney and how likely they would be to hire the attorney. People used the positive aspects of anger ( e.g. , conviction , power) , to justify hiring an angry male attorney. Yet , they used the negative aspects of anger ( e.g. , shrill , obnoxious) , to justify not hiring a female attorney. We replicated this effect in Experiment 2 with a community sample ( n = 294). Experiment 3 ( n = 273) demonstrated that the attorney anger by gender interaction generalized to perceptions of effectiveness across a set of additional attorney targets. Finally , a high-powered analysis collapsing across experiments confirmed that when expressing anger relative to when calm , female attorneys were seen as significantly less effective , while angry male attorneys were seen as significantly more effective. Women might not be able to harness the persuasive power of expressing anger in the courtroom , which might prevent female attorneys from advancing in their careers. ( PsycINFO Database Record
