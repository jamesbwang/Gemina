 Push-pull type fluorophores are often exploited as a biological probe because of their high environment-sensitivity nature. Herein , we report the potentiality of a push-pull fluorophore , 2-formyl-5- ( 4 '- N , N-dimethylaminophenyl) thiophene , as a membrane probe. This molecule exhibits strong absorbance in the violet region ( ∼ 400 nm) and a high emission quantum yield ( ≤ 0.6). The emission is highly sensitive to the surrounding environment , and a high Stokes shift ( > 7000 cm
