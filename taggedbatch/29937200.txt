 Chronic liver injury can cause cirrhosis and impaired liver regeneration , impairing organ function. Adult livers can regenerate in response to parenchymal insults , and multiple cellular sources have been reported to contribute to this response. In this study , we modeled human chronic liver injuries , in which such responses are blunted , without genetic manipulations , and assessed potential contributions of non-parenchymal cells ( NPCs) to hepatocyte regeneration. We show that NPC-derived hepatocytes replenish a large fraction of the liver parenchyma following severe injuries induced by long-term thioacetamide ( TAA) or 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine ( DDC) treatment. Through lineage tracing of biliary epithelial cells ( BECs) , we show that BECs are a source of new hepatocytes and gain an Hnf4Î±
