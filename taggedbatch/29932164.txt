 Nano-Sb ₂ O ₃ has excellent synergistic flame-retardant effects. It can effectively improve the comprehensive physical and mechanical properties of composites , reduce the use of flame retardants , save resources , and protect the environment. In this work , nanocomposites specimens were prepared by the melt-blending method. The thermal stability , mechanical properties , and flame retardancy of a nano-Sb ₂ O ₃ ⁻ brominated epoxy resin ( BEO) ⁻ poly ( butylene terephthalate) ( PBT) composite were analyzed , using TGA and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC) , coupled with EDX analysis , tensile testing , cone calorimeter tests , as well as scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) and flammability tests ( limiting oxygen index ( LOI) , UL94). SEM observations showed that the nano-Sb ₂ O ₃ particles were homogeneously distributed within the PBT matrix , and the thermal stability of PBT was improved. Moreover , the degree of crystallinity and the tensile strength were improved , as a result of the superior dispersion and interfacial interactions between nano-Sb ₂ O ₃ and PBT. At the same time , the limiting oxygen index and flame-retardant grade were increased as the nano-Sb ₂ O ₃ content increased. The results from the cone calorimeter test showed that the peak heat release rate ( PHRR) , total heat release rate ( THR) , peak carbon dioxide production ( PCO ₂ P) , and peak carbon monoxide production ( PCOP) of the nanocomposites were obviously reduced , compared to those of the neat PBT matrix. Meanwhile , the SEM ⁻ energy dispersive spectrometry ( EDX) analysis of the residues indicated that a higher amount of C element was left , thus the charring layer of the nanocomposites was compact. This showed that nano-Sb ₂ O ₃ could promote the degradation and charring of the PBT matrix , improving thermal stability and flame retardation.
