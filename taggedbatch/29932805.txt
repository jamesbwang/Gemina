 This study investigated the effect cadence has on the estimation of critical power ( CP) and the finite work capacity ( W ') during the 3-minute all-out cycling test. Ten participants completed 8 tests: 1) an incremental test to calculate gas exchange threshold ( GET) , maximal aerobic power ( MAP) and peak oxygen uptake ( VÌ‡O
