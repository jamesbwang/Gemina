 Long-term outcome data for patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy ( CEA) are lacking. As most of the published literature on CEA outcomes has been from high-volume providers , we wanted to investigate the outcomes of an average-volume cerebrovascular neurosurgeon. We reviewed a single neurosurgeon 's experience with CEA focusing on long-term outcomes. Most procedures ( 99.0 %) were performed with primary closure of the arteriotomy. We studied 192 CEAs performed between 1998 and 2017 , 77 % for symptomatic disease. Two patients ( 1 %) experienced immediate postoperative stroke. During an average follow-up of 53 months ( range , 0-205 months) , 2 more patients ( 1 %) experienced ipsilateral carotid circulation stroke , and 5 patients ( 2.6 %) experienced ipsilateral transient ischemic attacks. Five patients ( 2.6 %) experienced contralateral transient ischemic attacks , and 6 ( 3.1 %) experienced contralateral stroke. There were also 3 cases of ( 1.6 %) hemorrhagic stroke and 6 cases ( 3.1 %) of vertebrobasilar circulation stroke. The rate of ipsilateral stroke-free survival was 98.4 % at 5 years post-CEA , 97.9 % at 10 years post-CEA , and 97.9 % at 15 years post-CEA. The rate of ipsilateral restenosis-free survival was 97.9 % at 5 years post-CEA , 96.8 % at 10 years post-CEA , and 96.8 % at 15 years post-CEA. Six patients ( 3.1 %) experienced restenosis > 70 % during follow-up. Two of these patients underwent carotid artery stenting. Almost all patients ( > 95 %) were maintained on an antiplatelet medication and statin. In the hands of an average-volume cerebrovascular neurosurgeon , CEA can provide durable protection from recurrent stroke in the ipsilateral carotid distribution that extends beyond 15 years. Thus , this procedure should be considered the gold standard against which other revascularization modalities should be evaluated.
