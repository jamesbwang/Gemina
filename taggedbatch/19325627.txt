 Stem-group gnathostomes reveal the sequence of character acquisition in the origin of modern jawed vertebrates. The petalichthyids are placoderm-grade stem-group gnathostomes known from both isolated skeletal material and rarer articulated specimens of one genus. They are of particular interest because of anatomical resemblances with osteostracans , the jawless sister group of jawed vertebrates. Because of this , they have become central to debates on the relationships of placoderms and the primitive cranial architecture of gnathostomes. However , among petalichthyids , only the braincase of
