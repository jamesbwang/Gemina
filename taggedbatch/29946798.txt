 Bicalutamide ( BIC) , a non-steroidal anti-androgen , is FDA-indicated for use in combination with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH) analog for treatment of Stage D2 metastatic carcinoma of the prostate. Lack of consensus exists regarding the clinical benefit of BIC use , either alone or combined use of BIC with an LHRH analog or antagonist ( combined androgen blockade or CAB) , versus treatment with androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT) alone. The SEER-Medicare database was used to identify prostate cancer patients aged â‰¥ 66 years diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 and who filled at least one prescription for BIC. Duration of BIC treatment was assessed in relation to ADT use; either alone ( monotherapy) , as part of CAB only , and as part of CAB followed by monotherapy. Additionally , we assessed use of BIC during or outside a potential testosterone flare prevention period ( initiation within 2 months of an LHRH agonist). A total of 7521 prostate cancer patients who filled a prescription for BIC were identified. Eighteen percent of the cohort used BIC alone , over half the patients ( 54 %) used BIC as part of CAB and 27 % used BIC as part of CAB followed by monotherapy. Among men treated with BIC as part of CAB , 58 % received BIC only within the potential flare period. Although there is no FDA indication for BIC use as monotherapy , > 44 % of patients in this study used BIC alone or as part of CAB followed by monotherapy. Further research is necessary to understand the outcomes of BIC utilization in these settings , particularly compared with newer second-generation anti-androgens.
