 A high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric ( HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) method was developed for the quantification of MHI148-clorgyline amide ( NMI-amide) , a novel tumor-targeting monoamine oxidase A inhibitor , in mouse plasma. The method was validated in terms of sensitivity , precision , accuracy , recovery and stability and then applied to a pharmacokinetic study of NMI-amide in mice following intravenous administration. NMI-amide together with the internal standard ( IS) , MHI-148 , was extracted by protein precipitation using acetonitrile. Multiple reaction monitoring was used for quantification of NMI-amide by detecting
