 To study influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccination uptake in pregnant women from three Health Departments in the Valencian Community ( Spain) during the 2014-15 flu season , to identify degree of knowledge , sources of information and attitudes toward immunization against influenza<pathogen><disease>. Multicentre cross-sectional descriptive study during the 2014-15 vaccination campaign. Vaccine coverage was determined using the Nominal Vaccination Registry ( NVR). Subsequently , a telephone survey was carried out on a sample of vaccinated and unvaccinated postpartum women. The NVR had information on 934 ( 59.5 %) out of 1,569 postpartum women; distribution per Health Departments was: 420 ( 44.9 %) , 161 ( 17.2 %) and 353 ( 37.8 %) in La Ribera , Torrevieja and Elx-Crevillent respectively. Vaccine uptake was 27.9 % ( n = 261). According to the `` Country of Origin '' variable , 77.5 % ( n = 724) of women were Spanish , with a vaccination rate of 26.7 % ( n = 193) , compared to 22.5 % ( n = 210) who were non-Spanish , with a rate of 32.4 % ( n = 68). The main source of information was midwives for 83.7 % ( n = 159) of vaccinated pregnant women and for 44.6 % ( n = 127) of non-vaccinated women. The main reasons for vaccine refusal were lack of awareness ( 29.5 % , n = 84) and not considering it necessary ( 25.6 % , n = 73). Despite their high willingness to be vaccinated after receiving information about the flu vaccine , the vaccination coverage in pregnant women studied is still low and can be improved. Health professionals need new information strategies to extend vaccine uptake to a larger number of pregnant women in Spain. Midwife advice plays an essential role in transmitting information on influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccination in pregnant women and has a significant impact on uptake.
