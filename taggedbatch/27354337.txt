 Despite the extreme diversity of T-cell repertoires , many identical T-cell receptor ( TCR) sequences are found in a large number of individual mice and humans. These widely shared sequences , often referred to as `` public , '' have been suggested to be over-represented due to their potential immune functionality or their ease of generation by V ( D) J recombination. Here , we show that even for large cohorts , the observed degree of sharing of TCR sequences between individuals is well predicted by a model accounting for the known quantitative statistical biases in the generation process , together with a simple model of thymic selection. Whether a sequence is shared by many individuals is predicted to depend on the number of queried individuals and the sampling depth , as well as on the sequence itself , in agreement with the data. We introduce the degree of publicness conditional on the queried cohort size and the size of the sampled repertoires. Based on these observations , we propose a public/private sequence classifier , `` PUBLIC '' ( Public Universal Binary Likelihood Inference Classifier) , based on the generation probability , which performs very well even for small cohort sizes.
