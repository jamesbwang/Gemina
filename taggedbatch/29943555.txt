 Silver nanoparticles have widely applied for biomedical areas due to its potent antiviral and anti-bacterial activity. Synthesis of silver nanoparticles using biomacromoleculesis more efficient , environment-friendly and cost-saving compare with traditional approach. In this paper , a novel approach was developed to establish a reaction system with Ag
