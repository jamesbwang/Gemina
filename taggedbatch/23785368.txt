 Lignocellulose is one of the most abundant forms of fixed carbon in the biosphere. Current industrial approaches to the degradation of lignocellulose employ enzyme mixtures , usually from a single fungal species , which are only effective in hydrolyzing polysaccharides following biomass pre-treatments. While the enzymatic mechanisms of lignocellulose degradation have been characterized in detail in individual microbial species , the microbial communities that efficiently breakdown plant materials in nature are species rich and secrete a myriad of enzymes to perform `` community-level '' metabolism of lignocellulose. Single-species approaches are , therefore , likely to miss important aspects of lignocellulose degradation that will be central to optimizing commercial processes. Here , we investigated the microbial degradation of wheat straw in liquid cultures that had been inoculated with wheat straw compost. Samples taken at selected time points were subjected to multi-omics analysis with the aim of identifying new microbial mechanisms for lignocellulose degradation that could be applied in industrial pre-treatment of feedstocks. Phylogenetic composition of the community , based on sequenced bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomal genes , showed a gradual decrease in complexity and diversity over time due to microbial enrichment. Taxonomic affiliation of bacterial species showed dominance of A combination of mass spectrometry-based proteomics coupled with metatranscriptomics has enabled the identification of a large number of lignocellulose degrading enzymes that can now be further explored for the development of improved enzyme cocktails for the treatment of plant-based feedstocks. In addition to the expected carbohydrate-active enzymes , our studies reveal a large number of unknown proteins , some of which may play a crucial role in community-based lignocellulose degradation.
