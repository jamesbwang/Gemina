 A simple noninterferometric approach for probing the geometric phase of a structured Gaussian beam is proposed. Both the Gouy and Pancharatnam-Berry phases can be determined from the intensity distribution following a mode transformation if a part of the beam is covered at the initial plane. Moreover , the trajectories described by the centroid of the resulting intensity distributions following these transformations resemble those of ray optics , revealing an optical analogue of Ehrenfest 's theorem associated with changes in the geometric phase.
