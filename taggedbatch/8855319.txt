 Different serotypes of In this research , cultured samples were studied and strains identified through biochemical tests were recognized. Moreover , DNA was extracted and studied qualitatively and quantitatively. Four pairs of specialized primers related to This study was the first MLVA typing of the unencapsulated The highest diversity of the repeats was for VNTR5 ( 7 types) , followed by VNTR6 with 6 types of repeats , and VNTR12-1 and VNTR12-2 with 3 different types.
