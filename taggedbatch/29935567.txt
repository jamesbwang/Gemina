 Anaphylaxis during anaesthesia is a serious complication for patients and anaesthetists. The 6th National Audit Project ( NAP6) on perioperative anaphylaxis collected and reviewed 266 reports of Grades 3-5 anaphylaxis over 1 yr from all NHS hospitals in the UK. The estimated incidence was ≈ 1:10 000 anaesthetics. Case exclusion because of reporting delays or incomplete data means true incidence might be ≈ 70 % higher. The distribution of 199 identified culprit agents included antibiotics ( 94) , neuromuscular blocking agents ( 65) , chlorhexidine ( 18) , and Patent Blue dye ( 9). Teicoplanin comprised 12 % of antibiotic exposures , but caused 38 % of antibiotic-induced anaphylaxis. Eighteen patients reacted to an antibiotic test dose. Succinylcholine-induced anaphylaxis , mainly presenting with bronchospasm , was two-fold more likely than other neuromuscular blocking agents. Atracurium-induced anaphylaxis mainly presented with hypotension<symptom>. Non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agents had similar incidences to each other. There were no reports of local anaesthetic or latex-induced anaphylaxis. The commonest presenting features were hypotension<symptom> ( 46 %) , bronchospasm ( 18 %) , tachycardia<symptom> ( 9.8 %) , oxygen desaturation ( 4.7 %) , bradycardia<symptom> ( 3 %) , and reduced/absent capnography trace ( 2.3 %). All patients were hypotensive during the episode. Onset was rapid for neuromuscular blocking agents and antibiotics , but delayed with chlorhexidine and Patent Blue dye. There were 10 deaths and 40 cardiac arrests. Pulseless electrical activity was the usual type of cardiac arrest , often with bradycardia<symptom>. Poor<symptom> outcomes were associated with increased ASA , obesity , beta blocker , and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medication. Seventy per cent of cases were reported to the hospital incident reporting system , and only 24 % to Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency via the Yellow<pathogen><disease><symptom> Card Scheme. The overall incidence of perioperative anaphylaxis was estimated to be 1 in 10 000 anaesthetics.
