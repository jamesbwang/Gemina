 Known endocrine disruptor bisphenol A ( BPA) has been shown to be a reproductive toxicant in animal models. Its structural analogs: bisphenol S ( BPS) , bisphenol F ( BPF) , bisphenol AF ( BPAF) , and tetrabromobisphenol A ( TBBPA) are increasingly being used in consumer products. However , these analogs may exert similar adverse effects on the reproductive system , and their toxicological data are still limited. This mini-review examined studies on both BPA and BPA analog exposure and reproductive toxicity. It outlines the current state of knowledge on human exposure , toxicokinetics , endocrine activities , and reproductive toxicities of BPA and its analogs. BPA analogs showed similar endocrine potencies when compared to BPA , and emerging data suggest they may pose threats as reproductive hazards in animal models. While evidence based on epidemiological studies is still weak , we have utilized current studies to highlight knowledge gaps and research needs for future risk assessments.
