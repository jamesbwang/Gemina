 Pentacyclic triterpenes are diverse plant secondary metabolites derived from the mevalonate ( MVA) pathway. Many of these molecules are potentially valuable , particularly as pharmaceuticals , and research has focused on their production in simpler and more amenable heterologous systems such as the yeast Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen>. We have developed a new heterologous platform for the production of pentacyclic triterpenes in S.<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> based on a combinatorial engineering strategy involving the overexpression of MVA pathway genes , the knockout of negative regulators , and the suppression of a competing pathway. Accordingly , we overexpressed S.<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> ERG13 , encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA) synthase , and a truncated and deregulated variant of the rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase 1 ( tHMGR). In the same engineering step , we deleted the ROX1 gene , encoding a negative regulator of the MVA pathway and sterol biosynthesis , resulting in a push-and-pull strategy to enhance metabolic flux through the system. In a second step , we redirected this enhanced metabolic flux from late sterol biosynthesis to the production of 2,3-oxidosqualene , the direct precursor of pentacyclic triterpenes. In yeast cells transformed with a newly isolated sequence encoding lupeol synthase from the Russian dandelion ( Taraxacum koksaghyz) , we increased the yield of pentacyclic triterpenes by 127-fold and detected not only high levels of lupeol but also a second valuable pentacyclic triterpene product , Î²-amyrin.
