 Chronic kidney disease ( CKD) is highly prevalent but identification of patients at high risk for fast CKD progression before reaching end-stage renal disease in the short-term has been challenging. Whether factors associated with fast progression vary by diabetes status is also not well understood. We examined a large community-based cohort of adults with CKD to identify predictors of fast progression during the first 2 years of follow-up in the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. Within a large integrated healthcare delivery system in northern California , we identified adults with estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) 30-59 ml/min/1 .73 m We identified 36,195 eligible adults with eGFR 30-59 ml/min/1 .73 m In a large , contemporary population of adults with eGFR 30-59 ml/min/1 .73 m
