 Paleozoic holocephalian tooth plates are rarely found articulated in their original positions. When they are found isolated , it is difficult to associate the small , anterior tooth plates with the larger , more posterior ones. Tooth plates are presumed to have evolved from fusion of tooth files. However , there is little fossil evidence for this hypothesis. We report a tooth plate having nearly perfect bilateral symmetry from the Mississippian ( Chesterian Stage) Bangor Limestone of Franklin County , Alabama , USA. The high degree of symmetry suggests that it may have occupied a symphyseal or parasymphyseal position. The tooth plate resembles The new tooth plate is interpreted as an anterior tooth plate of a chondrichthyan fish. It is referred to
