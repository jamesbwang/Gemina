 Diabetic patients with a long disease duration usually accompanied complication such as diabetic retinopathy , but in some patients had no complication. We analyzed differences in plasma metabolites according to the presence or absence of diabetic retinopathy ( DR) in type 2 diabetic ( T2D) patients with disease duration â‰¥ 15 years. A cohort of 183 T2D patients was established. Their biospecimens and clinical information were collected in accordance with the guidelines of the National Biobank of Korea , and the Korean Diabetes Association. DR phenotypes of the subjects were verified by ophthalmologic specialists. Plasma metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. And these results were analyzed using multivariate statistics. For metabolomic study , propensity score matched case and control subjects were chosen. Mean age of the subjects was 66.4 years and mean T2D duration was 22.2 years. Metabolomic identification revealed various carbohydrates , amino acids , and organic compounds that distinguished between age- and sex-matched non-diabetic controls and T2D subjects. Among these , glutamine and glutamic acid were suggested as the most distinctive metabolites for the presence of DR. Receiver operating characteristics curves showed an excellent diagnostic value of combined ( AUC = 0.739) and the ratio ( AUC = 0.742) of glutamine and glutamic acid for DR. And these results were consistent in validation analyses. Our results imply that plasma glutamine , glutamic acid , and their ratio may be valuable as novel biomarkers for anticipating DR in T2D subjects.
