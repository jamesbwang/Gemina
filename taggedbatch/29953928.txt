 Skin has been increasingly recognized as an important drug administration route with topical formulations , offering a targeted approach for the treatment of several dermatological disorders. The effectiveness of this route is hampered by its natural barrier , the stratum corneum ( SC) , and hence , different strategies have been investigated to improve percutaneous drug transport. The design of nanodelivery systems , aiming at solving skin delivery issues , have been largely explored , due to their potential to revolutionize dermal therapies , improving therapeutic effectiveness and reducing side effects. Apart from nanosystem benefits , the fulfilment of the reproducibility requirements and quality standards still limit their industrial production. The optimization of nanosystem formulation and manufacturing process is complex , usually involving a large number of variables. Therefore , a science- and risk-oriented approach , such as Quality by Design ( QbD) will provide a comprehensive and noteworthy knowledge , yielding high quality drug products without extensive regulatory burden. This review aims to set up the basis for QbD development approach , encompassing preliminary and systematic risk assessments , with critical process parameters ( CPPs) and critical material attributes ( CMAs) identification , of different nanosystems potentially used in dermal therapies.
