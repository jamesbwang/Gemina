 Aquaculture plays an increasingly important role in the growing demand for seafood. Hatchery production of oyster larvae is an integral component of oyster farming , providing single seed for off-bottom farming or larvae for setting on larger substrates for on-bottom farming. Larvae from certain tanks in an established aquaculture enterprise were dying from an unknown etiologic agent. A metagenomic approach was used to examine oyster larvae and water from larval tanks with high and low survival rates to evaluate the epidemiological efficacy of this approach.
