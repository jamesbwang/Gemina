 A cavitand host has been shown to switch from a dimeric assembly to a tetrameric assembly in the presence of cations. Induced by pseudo-specific cation binding attenuating the net negative charge of each host , switching was shown to be highly cation selective. Thus , the concentration of cation required to induce assembly switching ranged from 2 mM in the case of N ( n-Bu)
