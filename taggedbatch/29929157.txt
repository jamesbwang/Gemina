 Attentional bias modification ( ABM) alleviates anxiety<symptom> by moderating biased attentional processing toward threat; however , its neural mechanisms remain unclear. We examined how ABM changes functional connectivity ( FC) and functional network measures , leading to anxiety<symptom> reduction. Fifty-four healthy anxious individuals received either ABM or sham training for 1 month in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Anxious traits , attentional control , and attentional bias were assessed. Thirty-five participants completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) scans before and after training. ABM significantly mitigated an anxious traits regarding physical stress vulnerability ( Î· Per-protocol analysis and reduced sample size in MRI analysis. ABM might augment the pulvinar 's control over vFPN to maintain endogenous attention to a behavioral goal , while diminishing the information exchanges of the postCG with vFPN to inhibit the capture of exogenous attention by potential threats. The pulvinar might play a critical role in ABM anxiolytic efficacy.
