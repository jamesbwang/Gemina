 Conjugative plasmid transfer is one of the major mechanisms responsible for the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. The incompatibility ( Inc) 18 group of plasmids is a family of plasmids replicating by the theta-mechanism , whose members have been detected frequently in enterococci and streptococci. Inc18 plasmids encode a variety of antibiotic resistances , including resistance to vancomycin , chloramphenicol and the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramine ( MLS) group of antibiotics. These plasmids comprising insertions of Tn1546 were demonstrated to be responsible for the transfer of vancomycin resistance encoded by the vanA gene from vancomycin resistant enterococci ( VRE) to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA). Thereby vancomycin resistant S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( VRSA) were generated , which are serious multi-resistant pathogens challenging the health care system. Inc18 plasmids are widespread in the clinic and frequently have been detected in the environment , especially in domestic animals and wastewater. pIP501 is one of the best-characterized conjugative Inc18 plasmids. It was originally isolated from a clinical Streptococcus<pathogen> agalactiae<pathogen> strain and is , due to its small size and simplicity , a model to study conjugative plasmid transfer in Gram-positive bacteria. Here , we report on the occurrence and spread of Inc18-type plasmids in the clinic and in different environments as well as on the exchange of the plasmids among them. In addition , we discuss molecular details on the transfer mechanism of Inc18 plasmids and its regulation , as exemplified by the model plasmid pIP501. We finish with an outlook on promising approaches on how to reduce the emerging spread of antibiotic resistances.
