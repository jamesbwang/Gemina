 We employed a coupled physical-biogeochemical modelling framework for the reconstruction of the historic ( H) , pre-industrial state of a coastal system , the German Bight ( southeastern North Sea) , and we investigated its differences with the recent , control ( C) state of the system. According to our findings: i) average winter concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus ( DIN and DIP) concentrations at the surface are ∼ 70-90 % and ∼ 50-70 % lower in the H state than in the C state within the nearshore waters , and differences gradually diminish towards off-shore waters; ii) differences in average growing season chlorophyll a ( Chl) concentrations at the surface between the two states are mostly less than 50 %; iii) in the off-shore areas , Chl concentrations in the deeper layers are affected less than in the surface layers; iv) reductions in phytoplankton carbon ( C) biomass under the H state are weaker than those in Chl , due to the generally lower Chl: C ratios; v) in some areas the differences in growth rates between the two states are negligible , due to the compensation by lower light limitation under the H state , which in turn explains the lower Chl: C ratios; vi) zooplankton biomass , and hence the grazing pressure on phytoplankton is lower under the H state. This trophic decoupling is caused by the low nutritional quality ( i.e. , low N: C and P: C) of phytoplankton. These results call for increased attention to the relevance of the acclimation capacity and stoichiometric flexibility of phytoplankton for the prediction of their response to environmental change.
