 The aim of this study was to determine changes in the quality of lamb meat ( Longissimus thoracis et lumborum) , which was vacuum-packaged and freezer-stored ( -26 °C) for 6 and 12 months. The experiment was performed on 12 male lambs of the Kamieniec Longwool breed , raised to 106 days of age. In comparison with fresh meat , thawed meat was characterized by lower ash content , higher pH , greater natural drip loss and cooking loss , and lower scores for taste intensity. Vacuum packaging and low-temperature storage protected lamb meat against oxidative changes , and alleviated the adverse effects of oxidation on the color , aroma and taste of meat. It can be concluded that freezer storage ( -26 °C) of vacuum-packaged meat can help meet consumer demand for lamb meat products in periods when fresh meat is unavailable. However , it should be noted that long-term frozen storage induces undesirable changes in meat quality , including a decrease in water-holding capacity and taste intensity.
