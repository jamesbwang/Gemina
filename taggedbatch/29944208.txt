 Peri-acenes are good model compounds for zigzag graphene nanoribbons , but their synthesis is extremely challenging owing to their intrinsic open-shell diradical character. Now , the successful synthesis and isolation of a stable peri-tetracene derivative PT-2ClPh is reported; four 2,6-dichlorophenyl groups are attached onto the most reactive sites along the zigzag edges. The structure was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis and its electronic properties were systematically investigated by both experiments and theoretical calculations. It exhibits an open-shell singlet ground state with a moderate diradical character ( y
