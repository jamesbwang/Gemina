 IVIM-DW imaging has shown potential usefulness in the study of pancreatic lesions<symptom>. Controversial results are available regarding the reliability of the measurements of IVIM-derived parameters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and the diagnostic potential of IVIM-derived parameters in differentiation among focal solid pancreatic lesions<symptom> and normal pancreas ( NP). Fifty-seven patients ( 34 carcinomas-PDACs , 18 neuroendocrine neoplasms-panNENs , and 5 autoimmune pancreatitis-AIP) and 50 subjects with NP underwent 1.5-T MR imaging including IVIM-DWI. Images were analyzed by two independent readers. Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) , slow component of diffusion ( D) , incoherent microcirculation ( Dp) , and perfusion fraction ( f) were calculated. Interobserver reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC). A Kruskal-Wallis H test with Steel-Dwass post hoc test was used for comparison. The diagnostic performance of each parameter was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis. Overall interobserver agreement was excellent ( ICC = 0.860 , 0.937 , 0.968 , and 0.983 for ADC , D , Dp , and f). D , Dp , and f significantly differed among PDACs and panNENs ( p = 0.002 , < 0.001 , and < 0.001) , albeit without significant difference at the pairwise comparison of ROC curves ( p = 0.08-0.74). Perfusion fraction was higher in AIP compared with PDACs ( p = 0.024; AUC = 0.735). Dp and f were higher in panNENs compared with AIP ( p = 0.029 and 0.023) , without differences at ROC analysis ( p = 0.07). IVIM-derived parameters have excellent reliability and could help in differentiation among solid pancreatic lesions<symptom> and NP.
