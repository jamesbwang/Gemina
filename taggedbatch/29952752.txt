 The performance of brain-computer interfaces ( BCIs) based on electroencephalography ( EEG) data strongly depends on the effective attenuation of artifacts that are mixed in the recordings. To address this problem , we have developed a novel online EEG artifact removal method for BCI applications , which combines blind source separation ( BSS) and regression ( REG) analysis. The BSS-REG method relies on the availability of a calibration dataset of limited duration for the initialization of a spatial filter using BSS. Online artifact removal is implemented by dynamically adjusting the spatial filter in the actual experiment , based on a linear regression technique. Our results showed that the BSS-REG method is capable of attenuating different kinds of artifacts , including ocular and muscular , while preserving true neural activity. Thanks to its low computational requirements , BSS-REG can be applied to low-density as well as high-density EEG data. We argue that BSS-REG may enable the development of novel BCI applications requiring high-density recordings , such as source-based neurofeedback and closed-loop neuromodulation.
