 The mitogenic effect of the analogous insulin glargine is currently under debate since several clinical studies have raised the possibility that insulin glargine treatment has a carcinogenic potential in different tissues. This study aimed to evaluate the Male Wistar rats were induced during one week with streptozotocin to develop Type 2 Diabetes ( T2D) and then randomly distributed into four groups. T2D rats included in the first group received insulin glargine , the second group received NPH insulin , the third group received metformin; finally , untreated T2D rats were included as the control group. All groups were treated for seven days; after the treatment , tissue samples of liver and colon were obtained. Quantitative PCR ( qPCR) was performed to analyze the The liver tissue showed overexpression of the Insr and These observations demonstrate that insulin glargine promote an excess of insulin and IGF-1 receptors in STZ-induced diabetic rats , which could overstimulate the mitogenic signaling pathways.
