 Bipolar spindle assembly is necessary to ensure the proper progression of cell division. Loss of spindle pole integrity leads to multipolar spindles and aberrant chromosomal segregation. However , the mechanism underlying the maintenance of spindle pole integrity remains unclear. In this study , we show that the actin-binding protein adducin-1 ( ADD1) is phosphorylated at S726 during mitosis. S726-phosphorylated ADD1 localizes to centrosomes , wherein it organizes into a rosette-like structure at the pericentriolar material. ADD1 depletion causes centriole splitting and therefore results in multipolar spindles during mitosis , which can be restored by re-expression of ADD1 and the phosphomimetic S726D mutant but not by the S726A mutant. Moreover , the phosphorylation of ADD1 at S726 is crucial for its interaction with TPX2 , which is essential for spindle pole integrity. Together , our findings unveil a novel function of ADD1 in maintaining spindle pole integrity through its interaction with TPX2.
