 Despite the important role of high-intensity statins in reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in secondary and primary prevention , substantial residual risk persists , particularly among high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> , and obesity. Considerable attention is currently directed to the role that elevated triglycerides ( TGs) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels play as important mediators of residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk , which is further strongly supported by genetic linkage studies. Previous trials with fibrates , niacin , and most cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors that targeted high-density lipoprotein cholesterol raising , and/or TG lowering , have failed to show conclusive evidence of incremental event reduction after low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were `` optimally controlled '' with statins. Although omega-3 fatty acids are efficacious in lowering TG levels and may have pleiotropic effects such as reducing plaque instability and proinflammatory mediators of atherogenesis , clinical outcomes data are currently lacking. Several ongoing randomized controlled trials of TG-lowering strategies with an optimal dosage of omega-3 fatty acids are nearing completion.
