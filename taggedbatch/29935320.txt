 Arteries that anastomose with the posterior inferior cerebellar artery ( PICA) can harbor aneurysms<disease>. We present a case of a patient who suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> as a result from an aneurysm<disease> on the left lateral spinal artery ( LSA) which anastomosed to the PICA. The aneurysm<disease> was surgically treated and the flow between the LSA and PICA was disrupted. The activated anastomotic network created a new anastomosis between the LSA and PICA which was seen at six months follow-up. Careful follow-up is warranted in patients who have an activated anastomotic network because they can potentially develop aneurysms<disease> on newly created anastomoses.
