 To explore the association between anemia<symptom> and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality among diabetic patients , and whether the association is modified by the presence of chronic kidney disease ( CKD). Physical examination data of 8 563 patients with diabetes who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria between 2010 and 2011 were collected , based on the prospective cohort data of Kailuan study. The deadline of the follow-up was December 31 , 2015 , and the endpoints comprised all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease. Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the association between anemia<symptom> with or without CKD , and cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality after adjustment for confounding factors. The average age of the subjects was ( 57.3 Â± 10.3) years , of whom the patients with anemia<symptom> accounted for 5.2 %. The proportion of the patients with anemia<symptom> combined with CKD was higher than that of the patients without anemia<symptom> ( 27.2 % vs. 20.8 % , P = 0.001). The median follow-up time was 4.9 years ( interquartile range: 4.6-5.2 years). During the follow-up period , 559 patients died , and 434 patients had cardiovascular disease. Compared with the patients without anemia<symptom> , the all-cause mortality rate of the patients with anemia<symptom> was higher ( 3 220.3/ 100 000 person-years vs. 1 257.9/ 100 000 person-years , P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of cardiovascular disease between the above two groups ( 999.8/ 100 000 person-years vs. 1 081.2/ 100 000 person-years , P > 0.05). The mortality and incidence of cardiovascular disease among the patients with CKD were higher than those of the patients without CKD ( 2 558.3/ 100 000 person-years vs. 1 044.0/ 100 000 person-years , P < 0.001; 1 605.9/ 100 000 person-years vs. 941.6/ 100 000 person-years , P < 0.001). Results of Cox regression model showed that , after adjustment for confounding factors , the all-cause mortality risk increased by 95 % in the diabetic patients with anemia<symptom> ( HR = 1.95 , 95 % CI: 1.50-2.54). Anemia<symptom> and CKD significantly increased the mortality risk among diabetic patients ( HR = 3.61 , 95 % CI: 2.48-5.26). The CKD patients without anemia<symptom> had an increased risk of cardiovascular disease ( HR = 1.41 , 95 % CI: 1.13-1.74). Anemia<symptom> is associated with an increased mortality risk in Chinese diabetic patients. Patients with CKD have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. The all-cause mortality risk increases significantly in anemia<symptom> patients with the presence of CKD , which indicates that we should focus on the prevention and treatment of diabetic patients with anemia<symptom> and CKD.
