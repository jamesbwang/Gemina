 Control of measles<pathogen> was the focus of a national workshop held in 2015 in Sydney , Australia , bringing together stakeholders in disease control and immunisation to discuss maintaining Australia 's measles<pathogen> elimination status in the context of regional and global measles<pathogen> control. The global epidemiology of measles<pathogen> was reviewed , including outbreaks in countries that have achieved elimination , such as the Disneyland outbreak in the United States and large outbreaks in Sydney , Australia. Transmission of measles<pathogen> between Australia and New Zealand occurs , but has not been a focus of control measures. Risk groups , the genetic and seroepidemiology of measles<pathogen> as well as surveillance , modelling and waning vaccine-induced immunity were reviewed. Gaps in policy , research and practice for maintaining measles<pathogen> elimination status in Australia were identified and recommendations were developed. Elimination of measles<pathogen> globally is challenging because of the infectiousness of measles<pathogen> and the need for 2-dose vaccine coverage rates in excess of 95 % in all countries to achieve it. Until this occurs , international travel will continue to permit measles<pathogen> importation from endemic countries to countries that have achieved elimination. When measles<pathogen> cases are imported , failure to diagnose and isolate cases places the health system at risk of measles<pathogen> outbreaks. Vaccine funding models can result in gaps in vaccine coverage for adults and migrants. Australia introduced a whole-of-life immunisation register in 2016 and catch-up vaccination for at-risk communities , which will improve measles<pathogen> control. Research on diagnosis , immunology , case management and modelling of vaccination strategies are important to ensure continued control of measles<pathogen>.
