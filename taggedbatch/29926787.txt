 Safe and efficient intravenous access is paramount to the practice of emergency medicine. We compared the first-stick success rates and blood spillage of two peripheral intravenous catheters in a busy urban emergency department. In this randomized controlled trial , we assigned emergency department patients requiring peripheral intravenous access to use of either a flash-tip catheter ( SurFlash Plus , Terumo Medical Corporation , Somerset , New Jersey) or a widely used control catheter ( Insyte Autoguard; Becton , Dickinson and Company , Franklin Lakes , New Jersey). We compared frequency of first-stick success and blood contamination between catheters using chi-squared analysis. We enrolled 600 patients , randomizing 309 to the flash-tip catheter and 291 to the control catheter. The first-stick success rate of each device was 79 %. Blood contamination , defined as spillage of blood on the patient 's skin , bedding , or the inserter , occurred in 8 of 309 cases ( 2.6 %) with the flash-tip catheter versus 92 of 291 cases ( 31.6 %) for the control catheter. The two catheters tested in this study had comparable rates of first-stick success , but the flash-tip catheter was associated with significantly less blood contamination during insertion attempts.
