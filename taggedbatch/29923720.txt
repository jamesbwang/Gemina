 The effectiveness of the optical rotation prediction ( ORP) basis set for computing specific rotations at the coupled cluster ( CC) level has been evaluated for a test set of 14 chiral compounds. For this purpose , the ORP basis set has been developed for the second-row atoms present in the investigated systems ( that is , for sulfur , phosphorus , and chlorine). The quality of the resulting set was preliminarily evaluated for seven molecules using time-dependent density-functional theory ( TD-DFT). Rotations were calculated with the coupled cluster singles and doubles method ( CCSD) as well as the second-order approximate coupled cluster singles and doubles method ( CC2) with the correlation-consistent aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets and extrapolated to estimate the complete basis-set ( CBS) limit for comparison with the ORP basis set. In the compounds examined here , the ORP calculations on molecules containing only first-row atoms compare favorably with results from the larger aug-cc-pVTZ basis set , in some cases lying closer to the estimated CBS limit , while results for molecules containing second-row atoms indicate that larger correlation-consistent basis sets are necessary to obtain reliable estimates of the CBS limit.
