 Ovarian cancer is associated with poor prognostic outcome due to late diagnosis and to intrinsic and acquired resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in a large number of patients. This chemoresistance is acquired through the peritoneal and ascites microenvironment by several released factors , such as IL-6 ,. Preclinical studies have implicated the activation of PI3K pathway in chemoresistance , showing it to extend tumor cell survival and modulate multidrug resistance. We aimed to evaluate the implication of the p110 alpha PI3K subunit in ovarian cancer chemoresistance acquisition , and to evaluate whether the STAT3 pathway can mediate resistance to PI3K inhibitors through secretion of IL6. Human ovarian adenocarcinoma IGROV-1 and JHOC-5 cells cultured in ascites showed an increase in carboplatinum-based resistance. Level of chemoresistance was associated to IL6 concentration in ascites. Activation of PI3K/Akt , STAT and MAPK pathways was observed after IGROV-1 incubation with ascites and treatment with carboplatin. Neither IGROV-1 nor JHOC-5 cells exposed to ascites treated with additional IL-6 directed antibody showed any reversion of the chemoresistance. IL6-related resistance was not abolished by the selective inhibition of PI3K alpha subunit coupled with the anti-IL6-receptor antibody tocilizumab. This dual inhibition requires further exploration in other ovarian cancer models such as clear cell carcinoma.
