 Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( ALL) are at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency , which might make them more susceptible to developing adverse events. Previous studies showed that low vitamin D levels were associated with an increased inflammatory mucosal state and impaired mucosal tissue barriers. We examined the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and studied the association between vitamin D levels and methotrexate ( MTX)- induced oral mucositis in pediatric ALL. We assessed 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D<pathogen> Vitamin D deficiency occurred in respectively 8 % ( < 30 nmol/L) and 33 % ( < 50 nmol/L) of the patients at T0 , and more frequently in children > 4 years of age as compared to children between 1 and 4 years of age. A decrease in 25 ( OH) D<pathogen> This study showed that vitamin D deficiency occurs frequently in pediatric ALL patients above the age of 4 years. A decrease in 25 ( OH) D<pathogen>
