 Many algorithms have been proposed for automated segmentation of white matter hyperintensities ( WMH) in brain MRI. Yet , broad uptake of any particular algorithm has not been observed. In this work , we argue that this may be due to variable and suboptimal validation data and frameworks , precluding direct comparison of methods on heterogeneous data. As a solution , we present Leave-One-Source-Out Cross Validation ( LOSO-CV) , which leverages all available data for performance estimation , and show that this gives more realistic ( lower) estimates of segmentation algorithm performance on data from different scanners. We also develop a FLAIR-only WMH segmentation algorithm: Voxel-Wise Logistic Regression ( VLR) , inspired by the open-source Lesion<symptom> Prediction Algorithm ( LPA). Our variant facilitates more accurate parameter estimation , and permits intuitive interpretation of model parameters. We illustrate the performance of the VLR algorithm using the LOSO-CV framework with a dataset comprising freely available data from several recent competitions ( 96 images from 7 scanners). The performance of the VLR algorithm ( median Similarity Index of 0.69) is compared to its LPA predecessor ( 0.58) , and the results of the VLR algorithm in the 2017 WMH Segmentation Competition are also presented.
