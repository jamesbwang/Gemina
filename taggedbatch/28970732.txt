 There is mounting evidence for the role of the gut microbiota and gut-brain interactions in neurological diseases. We present six patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who attained temporary seizure<symptom> freedom during antibiotic treatment. The effect on seizure<symptom> frequency waned within 2 weeks after cessation of antibiotic treatment. We hypothesized that antibiotic treatments may have a short-term effect , through gut microbiota disruption , on gut-brain interactions and ultimately seizure<symptom> frequency. This observed impact of antibiotics on seizure<symptom> frequency hints at a possible role of the gut microbiota in epilepsy and its manifestations. This begs the question: can epilepsy be treated by antibiotics? Or perhaps in a broader sense: can alterations in the gut microbiota be used as a treatment modality in drug-resistant epilepsy? This concept and the six intriguing cases provide interesting leads for epilepsy management.
