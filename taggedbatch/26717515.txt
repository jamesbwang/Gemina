 The Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees ( BEAST) software package has become a primary tool for Bayesian phylogenetic and phylodynamic inference from genetic sequence data. BEAST unifies molecular phylogenetic reconstruction with complex discrete and continuous trait evolution , divergence-time dating , and coalescent demographic models in an efficient statistical inference engine using Markov chain Monte Carlo integration. A convenient , cross-platform , graphical user interface allows the flexible construction of complex evolutionary analyses.
