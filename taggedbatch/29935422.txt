 The highly complex proprioceptive system provides neuromuscular control of the mobile cervical spine. Static neck flexion can induce the elongation of posterior tissues and altered afferent input from the mechanoreceptors. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of prolonged static neck flexion on neck<symptom> proprioception<symptom> and anticipatory postural adjustments. Thirty-eight healthy participants ( 20 females and 18 males) between the ages of 20-35 years with no history of neck , low<symptom> back , and shoulder pain enrolled in this study. Neck<symptom> proprioception<symptom> and anticipatory muscle activity were tested before and after 10-min static neck flexion. For assessment of neck<symptom> proprioception<symptom> , each participant was asked to perform 10 trials of the cervicocephalic relocation test to the neutral head position after active neck rotation to the left and right sides. Anticipatory postural adjustments were evaluated during a rapid arm flexion test. Following the flexion , the absolute and variable errors in head repositioning significantly increased ( p < 0.05). The results also showed that there was a significant delay in the onset of myoelectric activity of the cervical erector spinae muscles after flexion ( p = 0.001). The results of this study suggested that a 10-min static flexion can lead to changes in the neck<symptom> proprioception<symptom> and feed-forward control due to mechanical and neuromuscular changes in the viscoelastic cervical spine structures. These changes in sensory-motor control may be a risk factor for neck<symptom> pain<symptom> and injury.
