 Fission yeast ` cut ' mutants show defects in temporal coordination of nuclear division with cytokinesis , resulting in aberrant mitosis and lethality. Among other causes , the ` cut ' phenotype can be triggered by genetic or chemical perturbation of lipid metabolism , supposedly resulting in shortage of membrane phospholipids and insufficient nuclear envelope expansion during anaphase. Interestingly , penetrance of the ` cut ' phenotype in mutants of the transcription factor cbf11 and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase cut6 , both related to lipid metabolism , is highly dependent on growth media , although the specific nutrient ( s) affecting ` cut ' occurrence is not known. In this study , we set out to identify the growth media component ( s) responsible for ` cut ' phenotype suppression in Δcbf11 and cut6-621 cells. We show that mitotic defects occur rapidly in Δcbf11 cells upon shift from the minimal EMM medium ( ` cut ' suppressing) to the complex YES medium ( ` cut ' promoting). By growing cells in YES medium supplemented with individual EMM components , we identified ammonium chloride , an efficiently utilized nitrogen source , as a specific and potent suppressor of the ` cut ' phenotype in both Δcbf11 and cut6-621. Furthermore , we found that ammonium chloride boosts lipid droplet formation in wild-type cells. Our findings suggest a possible involvement of nutrient-responsive signaling in ` cut ' suppression.
