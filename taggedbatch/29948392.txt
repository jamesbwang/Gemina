 The literature suggests that psychological distress and quality of life are interdependent in couples coping with cancer. The current study seeks to extend these findings to physical symptom burden , examining differences in symptom self-rating and perception of partner symptoms. Couples were approached while waiting for an integrative oncology service. Fifty patients and their partners completed the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale ( ESAS-FS; twelve symptoms , scores 0-10 , 10 worst possible) and a Global Health measure ( PROMIS10). Patient and partner each also completed the ESAS-FS as it related to their perception of the other 's symptoms. ESAS distress subscales analyzed included Global ( GDS) , Psychosocial ( PSS) , and Physical ( PHS). Analyses included paired t tests to examine all measures. Fifty-eight percent of patients were female with most common cancer diagnoses of breast ( 22 %) , gastrointestinal ( 16 %) , and thoracic/H & N ( 16 %). For ESAS-FS self-ratings , patients had significantly higher physical distress than partners , with a no significant difference in psychosocial distress. For PROMIS10 self-ratings , patients reported significantly lower global health and physical health , ( p 's < 0.001); no differences were found for mental health between patients and caregivers. Patient rating of partner physical distress ( PHS , p = 0.01) was significantly higher than partner self-rating , with no significant difference observed in ratings for psychosocial distress. Partner rating of patient psychosocial distress ( PSS , p < 0.001) and physical distress ( PHS , p = 0.001) was significantly higher than that of patient self-rating. Our findings suggest that both patients and partners perceive physical distress of the other higher than self; however , patients may be more sensitive to psychosocial distress in their partners.
