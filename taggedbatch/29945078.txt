 In the context of a regional Chilean project ( FIC Taltape project , BIP code 30158422-0) , a multi-effect distillation ( MED) pilot plant has been built and installed in a small community in the north of Chile ( Taltape , Arica) in order to supply treated water for agricultural and domestic purposes. The aim of this paper is to assess the techno-economic feasibility of this system for supplying water with the required quality to the population. The characterization of the feed water and the effluents from the MED pilot plant ( distillate and brine) , obtained during five months of operation , has been firstly performed. Then , the prediction of the operation of the water treatment system with solar energy has been carried out using a typical meteorological year and the design of a static solar field that cover the thermal energy needs of the water treatment plant. The annual simulations of the MED pilot plant operating with solar energy showed that the water needs can be mostly covered using a static solar thermal field with a total area of 113.2 m
