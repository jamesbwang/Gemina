 Oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) is essential for the development and growth of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) , but the precise roles of EGFR in lung cancer metabolism remain unclear. Here , we show that EGFR mutation-mediated enhancement of glycolysis is critical for EGFR stability. EGFR knockdown significantly decreased levels of glycolytic pathway intermediates via transcriptional regulation of glycolytic genes. EGFR mutation-enhanced glycolysis was required for fueling the tricarboxylic acid cycle , a critical component of EGFR stability. Nonsustained ATP production enhanced reactive oxygen species accumulation and subsequent JNK-mediated activation of autophagy , which in turn induced EGFR degradation. Our data shows that EGFR-mutant NSCLCs require EGFR mutation-enhanced glycolysis to maintain EGFR stability. This pathway may serve as an attractive therapeutic target for EGFR-mutant NSCLCs.
