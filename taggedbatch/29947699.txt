 This study identified and summarized all Cochrane systematic reviews ( SRs) on the effects of ten integrative practices that were recently added to the Brazilian public healthcare system ( SUS). Review of systematic reviews , conducted in the Discipline of Evidence-Based Medicine , Escola Paulista de Medicina ( EPM) , Universidade Federal de SÃ£o Paulo ( Unifesp). Review of Cochrane SRs on the following interventions were identified , summarized and critically assessed: apitherapy , aromatherapy , bioenergetics , family constellation , flower therapy , chromotherapy , geotherapy , hypnotherapy , hand imposition or ozone therapy. We included a total of 16 SRs: 4 on apitherapy , 4 on aromatherapy , 6 on hypnotherapy and 2 on ozone therapy. No Cochrane SR was found regarding bioenergetics , family constellation , chromotherapy , clay therapy , flower therapy or hand imposition. The only high-quality evidence was in relation to the potential benefit of apitherapy , specifically regarding some benefits from honey dressings for partial healing of burn wounds<disease><symptom> , for reduction of coughing among children with acute<symptom> coughs<symptom> and for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings. Except for some specific uses of apitherapy ( honey for burn wounds<disease><symptom> and for acute<symptom> coughs<symptom> and bee venom for allergic reactions to insect stings) , the use of ten integrative practices that have recently been incorporated into SUS does not seem to be supported by evidence from Cochrane SRs.
