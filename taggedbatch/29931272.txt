 This study employed cell recycling , batch adaptation , cell mating and high-throughput screening to select adapted Spathaspora passalidarum strains with improved fermentative ability. The most promising candidate YK208-E11 ( E11) showed a 3-fold increase in specific fermentation rate compared to the parental strain and an ethanol yield greater than 0.45 g/g substrate while co-utilizing cellobiose , glucose and xylose. Further characterization showed that strain E11 also makes 40 % less biomass compared to the parental strain when cultivated in rich media under aerobic conditions. A tetrazolium agar overlay assay in the presence of respiration<symptom> inhibitors , including rotenone , antimycin A , KCN and salicylhydroxamic acid elucidated the nature of the mutational events. Results indicated that E11 has a deficiency in its respiration<symptom> system that could contribute to its low cell yield. Strain E11 was subjected to whole genome sequencing and an âˆ¼ 11 kb deletion was identified; the open reading frames absent in strain E11 code for proteins with predicted functions in respiration<symptom> , cell division and the actin cytoskeleton , and may contribute to the observed physiology of the adapted strain. Results of the tetrazolium overlay also suggest that cultivation on xylose affects the respiration<symptom> capacity in the wild-type strain , which could account for its faster fermentation of xylose as compared to glucose. These results support our previous finding that S. passalidarum has highly unusual physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> to xylose under oxygen limitation.
