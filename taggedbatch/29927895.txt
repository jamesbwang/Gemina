J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-Small-sided games ( SSGs) are considered an effective training tool for physical development in soccer. Small-sided games can be modified in several ways to manipulate the physical demands to best match the game demands , player characteristics , and session objectives. The aim of this study was to compare the physiological , perceptual , and Global Positioning System ( GPS)- derived time-motion characteristics of man marking ( MM) vs. non-man marking ( NMM) in 2v2 , 3v3 , and 4v4 SSGs. In an acute crossover design , 8 amateur soccer players ( mean age ± SD: 23.6 ± 3.3 years) played 2v2 , 3v3 , and 4v4 SSGs consisting of 4 × 4-minute bouts , with 2-minute passive recovery. During all SSGs , players wore a heart rate ( HR) monitor and GPS unit and reported their rating of perceived exertion ( RPE). Average percent HR ( % HRave) induced small to moderate effects with MM compared with NMM ( % Δ = 1-2.7 %; effect size ( ES) = 0.22-0.65). Comparisons between MM formats indicated a decrease in % HRave with increased player numbers ( % Δ = 1.6-3.5 %; ES = 0.39-0.86). Perceptual load increased with MM compared with NMM ( % Δ = 6.7-17.6 %; ES = 0.66-2.09) , whereas increases in player numbers ( MM only) reduced RPE output ( % Δ = 9.4-24.3 %; ES = 1.14-3.61). Time-motion characteristics revealed substantially greater total distance covered in MM irrespective of player number ( % Δ = 6.8-14.7 %; ES = 1.34-2.82). There were very likely increases in distances covered at striding ( 13.1-17.8 km · h) ( % Δ: 23.4-33.2; ES = 2.42-4.35) and high-intensity running ( HIR) ( 17.9-21 km · h) ( % Δ: 47.3-104; ES = 0.91-1.68) for MM compared with NMM irrespective of player number. In conclusion , MM substantially elevated perceptual load and distances from striding to HIR regardless of player number , whereas differences between NMM and MM for internal load remain unclear. Use of MM may allow coaches to condition for particularly demanding phases of the game and prescription of larger SSG formats to increase distance covered at higher velocities.
