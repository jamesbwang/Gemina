 The synthesis of a novel heterocubane ( RSnE) 4 was successful for E = As , while for E = P differing behaviour was observed. Aryl-substituted chlorostannylenes were treated with salts of heavy cyanate homologues PCO- and AsCO-. The reaction with AsCO- salts afforded primarily ( TerSnAs) 4 ( Ter = 2,6-dimesitylphenyl). In contrast , the reaction of TerSnCl with NaPCO proceeded considerably less cleanly affording a mixture of products. The main product was putatively a neutral ( Ter4Sn4P4) compound , however , it is not a cubane. A variety of by-products of this reaction could be characterised crystallographically.
