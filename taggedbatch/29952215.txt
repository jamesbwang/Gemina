 The aim of this study was to assess the washout rate ( WOR) for thallium-201-chloride single-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI) using cadmium zinc telluride detectors for SPECT ( CZT SPECT) versus conventional Anger-type SPECT ( conventional SPECT). A total of 52 Japanese patients were examined using CZT SPECT and conventional SPECT , and the global WORs were compared. Additionally , the MPI WORs were compared for patients with a normal MPI versus those in whom MPI reflected the patients ' multivessel disease ( MVD) MPI. Washout rates were similar when approximated by CZT SPECT versus conventional SPECT 12.59 ± 2.26 %/ h vs 12.57 ± 2.27 %/ h ( P = .997) , respectively. The WOR values for CZT SPECT versus conventional SPECT were 13.42 %/ h ( 1.53 %/ h) vs 13.93 %/ h ( 1.24 %/ h) ( P = .337) , respectively , for 7 normal MPI patients , and 10.64 ± 2.20 %/ h vs 10.84 ± 2.26 %/ h ( P = .848) , respectively , for 7 MVD-MPI patients. The WOR values for normal MPI versus MVD-MPI patients for CZT SPECT were 13.42 ± 1.53 %/ h vs 10.64 ± 2.20 %/ h ( P = .025) , respectively. Thallium-201-chloride WOR values obtained with high-efficiency CZT SPECT , which enabled significantly reduced imaging times and use of a low-dose protocol , were similar to those obtained with conventional SPECT.
