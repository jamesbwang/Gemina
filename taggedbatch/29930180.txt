 A 72-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with acute onset confusion<symptom> and haemoptysis. Chest X-ray showed a possible lung mass , while CT head showed a fluid-filled , space-occupying lesion<symptom> ( SOL) in the right frontal lobe of the brain. MRI head indicated that this SOL had spilt its contents into the subarachnoid and intraventricular spaces. Due to a fluctuating Glasgow Coma<symptom> Scale ( GCS) , the patient underwent emergency debulking. Macroscopically , a frail-walled cystic tumour filled with straw-coloured fluid was noted; histology confirmed metastasis from a primary lung adenocarcinoma. Whole brain radiotherapy was given , with a view to commence systemic therapy. The patient , however , deteriorated and unfortunately passed away a few weeks after completing radiotherapy. This patient presented with leptomeningeal metastasis as the first presentation of a lung adenocarcinoma , and had a highly unusual mechanism by which leptomeningeal spread had occurred , with metastatic brain tumour spilling its contents into the meningeal spaces.
