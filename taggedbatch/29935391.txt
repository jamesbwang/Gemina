 The development of size-selective and non-destructive detection techniques for nanosized biomarkers has many reasons , including the study of living cells and diagnostic applications. We present an approach for Raman signal enhancement on biocompatible sensing chips based on surface enhancement Raman spectroscopy ( SERS). A sensing chip was fabricated by forming a ZnO-based nanorod structure so that the Raman enhancement occurred at a gap of several tens to several hundred nanometers. The effect of coffee-ring formation was eliminated by introducing the porous ZnO nanorods for the bio-liquid sample. A peculiarity of this approach is that the gold sputtered on the ZnO nanorods initially grows at their heads forming clusters , as confirmed by secondary electron microscopy. This clustering was verified by finite element analysis to be the main factor for enhancement of local surface plasmon resonance ( LSPR). This clustering property and the ability to adjust the size of the nanorods enabled the signal acquisition points to be refined using confocal based Raman spectroscopy , which could be applied directly to the sensor chip based on the optimization process in this experiment. It was demonstrated by using common cancer cell lines that cell growth was high on these gold-clad ZnO nanorod-based surface-enhanced Raman substrates. The porosity of the sensing chip , the improved structure for signal enhancement , and the cell assay make these gold-coated ZnO nanorods substrates promising biosensing chips with excellent potential for detecting nanometric biomarkers secreted by cells.
