 Osteosynthesis has evolved theoretically and practically throughout its evolution. Similar to trends in other surgical fields , surgical techniques in fracture fixation , such as minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis ( MIPO) , have moved from large dissections to more tissue sparing methods. These plating techniques have been developed for a variety of bones , but more universal clinical adoption will rely upon improved clinical outcomes. The current review will describe minimally invasive techniques , evaluate their rationale , and summarize evidence for their efficacy.
