 With the widespread use of natural pyrethrins and pyrethroids to defend pest insects , people had the sustained interest in the potential risk to environment and human health. However , the research about natural pyrethrins and beta-cypermethrin induction of cytotoxicity is still seldom. This study is about the cytotoxic effects of these on human non-target cells in vitro. The cytotoxic effect of natural pyrethrins and beta-cypermethrin on QSG7701 cells were researched by using various bioassays in vitro. The results suggested that with the natural pyrethrin concentration increased , the viability of QSG7701 cells were inhibited increasingly , and the IC
