 To explore the present status of fluid therapy and clinical outcome in critically ill patients in intensive care units ( ICU). ICU patients consecutively admitted to our ICU were prospectively enrolled. Patients ' demographics , laboratory data , fluid record and clinical outcome were collected. Fluid intake quantity of all patients was at peak on the fifth day which was 2 806 ( 1 997 , 3 582) ml. From the fourth day in ICU , fluid balance<symptom> started to benegative as -84 ( -1 127 , 612) ml and gradually increased. Crystalloid solution was the main components. For treatment purposes , medication injections and nutrients were major fluids. Positive correlations were found between total fluid intake quantity , total crystalloid volume , total colloidal volume and hospital stay , ICU stay , duration of intubation (
