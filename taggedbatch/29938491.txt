 Global environmental challenges especially nuclear pollution pose a great threat to human health and public safety. Metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs) with high surface area and excellent stability are potential candidates for the remediation of nuclear pollution. Herein , a ZIF-8-based polyacrylonitrile ( PAN) fibrous filter was prepared by an in situ hydrothermal treatment of fibrous filters consisting of PAN , poly ( vinylpyrrolidone) ( PVP) , and zinc ions with an electrospinning method. In the process of hydrothermal treatment , PVP can be extracted from the PAN nanofibers and result in porous structures. Benefiting from these porous structures , the in situ ZIF-8/ PAN filters demonstrated a high adsorption capacity of U ( VI) ( 530.3 mg g
