 The dispersibility and stability issues of peptide drugs during preparation and storage hinder the widespread adoption of pressurized metered-dose inhaler ( pMDI). This study aimed to develop a reverse microemulsion ( RM) of exenatide ( EXE) pMDI through a liquid-based bottom-up method , thus to overcome the stability issue of peptide drugs encountered in traditional top-down methods , such as milling down and high-pressure homogenization. In this study , Pluronic ® L64 ( L64) was chosen as a surfactant to prepare the EXE-RM pMDI formulations with the assistance of ethanol. The results showed RM possessed a particle size of 123.80 ± 2.91 nm with 0.121 ± 0.024 PdI and a satisfied fine-particle fraction of 41.30 ± 3.73 % measured by a next-generation impactor. In addition , the dispersion stability of RM pMDI was maintained after storage at 4 °C for 50 days. The secondary structure of EXE was maintained during the preparation process. Moreover , the results indicated that L64 was compatible with cells and could improve the penetration of EXE through cell monolayers. Through the liquid-based bottom-up method , EXE-RM pMDI was successfully prepared and exhibited favorable stability and aerodynamic performance. This study offers a preparation strategy to enhance the stability of peptides in pMDIs.
