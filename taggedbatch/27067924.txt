 To determine the efficacy of real-time PCR for the diagnosis and prognosis of varicella-zoster virus ( VZV) keratitis<disease><symptom>. Retrospective case series. Patients: 545 consecutive patients with keratitis<disease><symptom> were examined to quantify copy numbers of VZV DNA by real-time PCR. Association of copy numbers of VZV DNA to clinical signs and disease course was assessed by logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazard model. Of the 545 eyes , 38 ( 6.9 %) were diagnosed as VZV keratitis<disease><symptom>. The median copy number of the VZV DNA was 10 Higher VZV DNA copy numbers are associated with the refractoriness of VZV keratitis<disease><symptom> , and its evaluation may be a useful way to clinically diagnose and manage VZV keratitis<disease><symptom>.
