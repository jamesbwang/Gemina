 This study compared the efficacy of catheter ablation of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) between impedance ( IMP)- guided and contact force ( CF)- guided annotation using the automated annotation system ( VisiTag ™). Fifty patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI) for AF were randomized to the IMP-guided or CF-guided groups. The annotation criteria for VisiTag ™ were a 10 second minimum ablation time and 2 mm maximum catheter movement range. A minimum CF of 10 g was added to the criteria in the CF-guided group. In the IMP-guided group , a minimum IMP drop of over 5 Ω was added to the criteria. The rates of successful PVI after an initial ablation line were higher in the CF-guided group ( 80 % vs 48 % , Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ablation using an automated annotation system guided by CF improved the success rate of PVI after the initial circumferential ablation. An IMP-guided annotation combined with catheter stability criteria showed similar clinical outcomes as compared to the CF-guided annotation.
