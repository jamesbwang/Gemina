 This study aims to evaluate EZSCAN detection in pilots and the general population , and determine the significance of EZSCAN detection in the identification of a pilot 's health. A total of 87 cases of non-diabetic Air Force pilots ( pilot group) and 49 cases from the general population without diabetes were collected. These two groups of subjects underwent EZSCAN detection , as well as the detection of blood glucose , lipid and uric acid levels. Subjects in the pilot group had the highest detection rate of no risk and the lowest detection rate of high risk , while the general population had the highest detection rate of high risk , followed by low risk. The difference in diabetic risk between these two groups were statistically significant ( P < 0.01). Various indicators were compared according to different risk levels. In the no risk group , age , BMI and the triglyceride of pilots were lower than in the general population; and the difference was statistically significant ( P < 0.05). In high risk group , BMI and blood uric acid of pilots were lower than in the general population; and the difference was statistically significant ( P < 0.05). BMI and blood uric acid are positively correlated to diabetic risk. The EZSCAN detection system can be used for assessment of pilot 's diabetic risk , and has certain significance in a pilot 's health identification.
