 With the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> there is a pressing need for new oral drugs with novel mechanisms of action. Herein , we describe the identification of a novel morpholino-thiophenes ( MOT) series following phenotypic screening of the Eli Lilly corporate library against M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> strain H37Rv<pathogen>. The design , synthesis , and structure-activity relationships of a range of analogues around the confirmed actives are described. Optimized leads with potent whole cell activity against H37Rv<pathogen> , no cytotoxicity flags , and in vivo efficacy in an acute murine model of infection are described. Mode-of-action studies suggest that the novel scaffold targets QcrB , a subunit of the menaquinol cytochrome c oxidoreductase , part of the bc1-aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase complex that is responsible for driving oxygen-dependent respiration<symptom>.
