 Some thyroid carcinomas ( TCs) have a violent biological behavior and poor prognosis , and lacking of effective molecular markers is still the main obstacle for clinical stratified diagnosis and treatment of TC. The aim of the study was to discover the clinicopathological and prognostic implications of Src homology region 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 ( SHP2) and Hook microtubule tethering protein 1 ( Hook1) expression in TC. The expression of SHP2 and Hook1was detected by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays from 313 primary TC who underwent surgery during January 2006 and January 2010 in Zhejiang Cancer Hospital. Chi-square test , Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional-hazards regression models were employed to analyze the associations between their expressions and clinicopathological features and prognosis. The expression rate of SHP2 and Hook1 in TC was 57.5 % ( 180/313) and 22.0 % ( 69/313) , respectively. SHP2 was positively correlated with Hook1 in TC. SHP2 expression differed significantly by age , histological variants , maximal tumor diameter , intrathyroidal dissemination , metastases , and disease stage ( P < 0.05). Moreover , Patients with high SHP2 expression had reduced risk for death of disease compared to those with low SHP2 expression ( Hazard ratio ( HR) = 0.267 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.105-0.684 , P = 0.006) in univariate analysis , but that multivariate analysis failed to suggest that SHP2 was an independent prognostic factor. Hook1 expression differed significantly by histological variants , maximal tumor diameter , and intrathyroidal dissemination ( P < 0.05). However , there was no significant correlation between Hook1 expression and outcome in TC ( P > 0.05). Our results suggested that SHP2 may be a favorable indicator of prognosis in TC.
