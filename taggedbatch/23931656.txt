 Mental health programs to improve problem-solving skills and reduce stress through social gameplay can improve psychiatric outcomes , but little is known about whether adult patients are interested in using them. Primary care patients ( n = 467) completed a cross-sectional survey to assess interest in using 2 types of group programs for mental health. A significantly greater percentage ( 23.7 %) of patients expressed interest in a gameplay-based program than in interpersonal therapy ( 17.6 %) ( P < .001). Lonely patients and younger patients were more likely to report interest in gameplay. Results suggest that diverse patient populations are interested in using gameplay programs for mental health.
