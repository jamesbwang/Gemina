 Public availability of biological sequences is essential for their widespread access and use by the research community. The Universal Protein Resource ( UniProt) is a comprehensive resource for protein sequence and functional data. While most protein sequences entering UniProt are imported from other source databases containing nucleotide or 3-D structure data , protein sequences determined at the protein level can be submitted directly to UniProt. To this end , UniProt provides a Web interface called SPIN. This service enables researchers to make their de novo-sequenced proteins available to the scientific community and acquire UniProt accession numbers for use in publications. This unit explains the process of submitting a protein sequence to UniProt using SPIN. The basic protocol describes all the necessary steps for a single sequence. A support protocol gives guidance on how best to deal with exceptionally large datasets. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
