 Ontogenetic growth functions provide basic information in biological and ecological studies. Various growth functions classified into the Pütter model have been used historically , regardless of controversies over their appropriateness. Here , we present a novel growth function for fish and aquatic organisms ( generalised q-VBGF) by considering an allocation schedule of allometrically produced surplus energy between somatic growth and reproduction. The generalised q-VBGF can track growth trajectories in different life history strategies from determinate to indeterminate growth by adjusting the value of the ` growth indeterminacy exponent ' q. The timing of maturation and attainable body size can be adjusted by the ` maturation timing parameter ' τ while maintaining a common growth trajectory before maturation. The generalised q-VBGF is a comprehensive growth function in which exponentials in the traditional monomolecular , von Bertalanffy , Gompertz , logistic , and Richards functions are replaced with q-exponentials defined in the non-extensive Tsallis statistics , and it fits to actual data more adequately than these conventional functions. The relationship between the estimated parameter values τ and rq forms a unique hyperbola , which provides a new insight into the continuum of life history strategies of organisms.
