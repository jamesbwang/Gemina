 To investigate the changes in the quality of life and behaviors in children before and after wearing orthokeratology lenses and to analyze the potential impact of orthokeratology lenses on children 's quality of life , behaviors , and the progression of myopia. A total of 100 children receiving orthokeratology lenses in the People 's Hospital of Hebei Province and the Nanjing First Hospital from January 2016 to February 2017 were enrolled in this study. A questionnaire survey was conducted for the orthokeratology lenses wearers before and 3 months after wearing the orthokeratology lenses , and analysis was performed for the 69 valid questionnaires. The scores of symptom module , entertainment module , and study and life module marked by the children differed significantly 3 months after wearing the orthokeratology lenses. Among 20 entries , the life quality scores of nine surveys before and after wearing lenses were statistically significant ( P < 0.05). The main reason why the children chose orthokeratology lenses was more convenience in athletic activities ( 43.5 %). The majority of children ( 75.4 %) were willing to accept orthokeratology lenses to correct vision and to alleviate myopia progression. Orthokeratology lenses have a good effect on children 's quality of life , behaviors , and psychology. The children who wore lenses were more self-confident , more willing to try new things , and more active in participating in sports and entertainment , resulting in an increasing trend of the total time spent on outdoor activities.
