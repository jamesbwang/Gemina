 ( Purpose) To clarify the relationship between the laterality of one-leg standing time ( OLST) due to blocking of visual information and the laterality of hip internal rotation ( IR) range of motion ( ROM). ( Subjects and Methods) The study included 101 young healthy male and female students. Hip IR ROM was classified into three patterns using left and right differences. Regarding OLST , differences between the left and right measured values with eyes open and closed were classified into three patterns. The matching rate between hip IR ROM laterality pattern and OLST laterality pattern was examined with eyes open and closed. The matching rate of the OLST laterality pattern with hip IR ROM laterality pattern in an imbalanced group was examined. ( Results) A significant difference was observed between eyes open and closed conditions in the matching rates of OLST and Hip IR ROM laterality patterns in the imbalanced group. In the imbalanced group , the pattern on the side where the Hip IR is greater changes to coincide with the pattern on the side where the OLST is longer , under the eyes closed condition. ( Conclusion) OLST on the side of greater Hip IR ROM tends to be longer due to visual information interception.
