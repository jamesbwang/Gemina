 This study provides an update and comparison to a 2010 nationwide survey on cardiac electrophysiology ( EP) , types and numbers of interventional electrophysiological procedures , and training opportunities in 2015. In 2010 , German cardiology centers performing interventional EP were identified and contacted to provide a survey on cardiac EP. German cardiology centers performing interventional EP in 2015 were identified from quality reports and contacted to repeat the 2010 questionnaire. A majority of 131 centers ( 57 %) responded. EP ( ablation procedures and device therapy) was mainly part of a cardiology department ( 89 %) and only independent ( with its own budget) in 11 %. The proportion of female physicians in EP training increased from 26 % in 2010 to 38 % in 2015. In total , 49,356 catheter ablations ( i.e. , 81 % of reported ablations in 2015) were performed by the responding centers , resulting in a 44 % increase compared with 2010 ( the median number increased from 180 to 297 per center). Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) was the most common arrhythmia interventionally treated ( 47 %). At 66 % of the centers , ( at least) 2 physicians were present during most catheter ablations. A minimum of 50 ( 75) AF ablations were performed at 80 % ( 70 %) of the centers. Pulmonary vein isolation with radiofrequency point-by-point ablation ( 62 %) and cryoablation ( 33 %) were the preferred ablation strategies. About one-third of centers reported surgical AF ablations , with 11 centers ( 8 %) performing stand-alone surgical AF ablations. Only one-third of the responding 131 centers fulfilled all requirements for training center accreditation. Comparing 2010 with 2015 , an increasing number of EP centers and procedures in Germany are registered. In 2015 , almost every second ablation was for therapy for AF. Thus , an increasing demand for catheter ablation is likely , but training opportunities are still limited , and most centers do not fulfil recommended requirements for ablation centers.
