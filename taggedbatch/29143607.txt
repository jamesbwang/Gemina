 Transposable elements make important contributions to adaptation and evolution of their host genomes. The well-characterized transposase-derived transcription factor FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYLS3 ( FHY3) and its homologue FAR-RED IMPAIRED RESPONSE1 ( FAR1) have crucial functions in plant growth and development. In addition , FHY3 and FAR1 are the founding members of the FRS ( FAR1-RELATED SEQUENCE) and FRF ( FRS-RELATED FACTOR) families , which are conserved among land plants. Although the coding sequences of many putative FRS and FRF orthologs have been found in various clades of angiosperms , their physiological functions remain elusive. Here , we summarize recent progress toward characterizing the molecular mechanisms of FHY3 and FAR1 , as well as other FRS-FRF family proteins , examining their roles in regulating plant growth and development. This review also suggests future directions for further functional characterization of other FRS-FRF family proteins in plants.
