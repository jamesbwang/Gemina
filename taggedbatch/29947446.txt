 P-wave duration , its dispersion and signal-averaged ECG , are currently used markers of vulnerability to atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF). However , since tangential atrial currents are better detectable at the body surface as magnetic than electric signals , we investigated the accuracy of magnetocardiographic mapping ( MCG) , recorded in unshielded clinical environments , as predictor of AF occurrence. MCG recordings , in sinus rhythm ( SR) , of 71 AF patients and 75 controls were retrospectively analyzed. Beside electric and magnetic P-wave and PR interval duration , two MCG P-wave subintervals , defined P-dep and P-rep , were measured , basing on the point of inversion of atrial magnetic field ( MF). Eight parameters were calculated from inverse solution with `` Effective Magnetic Dipole ( EMD) model '' and 5 from `` MF Extrema '' analysis. Discriminant analysis ( DA) was used to assess MCG predictive accuracy to differentiate AF patients from controls. All but one ( P-rep) intervals were significantly longer in AF patients. At univariate analysis , three EMD parameters differed significantly: in AF patients , the dipole-angle-elevation angular speed was lower during P-dep ( p < 0.05) and higher during P-rep ( p < 0.001) intervals. The space-trajectory during P-rep and the angle-dynamics during P-dep were higher ( p < 0.05) , whereas ratio-dynamics P-dep was lower ( p < 0.01) , in AF. At DA , with a combination of MCG and clinical parameters , 81.5 % accuracy in differentiating AF patients from controls was achieved. At Cox-regression , the angle-dynamics P-dep was an independent predictor of AF recurrences ( p = 0.037). Quantitative analysis of atrial MF dynamics in SR and the solution of the inverse problem provide new sensitive markers of vulnerability to AF.
