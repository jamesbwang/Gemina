 The musculoskeletal system can move in more ways than are strictly necessary , allowing many tasks to be accomplished with a variety of limb configurations. Why some configurations are preferred has been a focus of motor control research , but most studies have focused on shoulder-elbow or whole-arm movements. This study focuses on movements involving forearm pronation-supination ( PS) , wrist flexion-extension ( FE) , and wrist radial-ulnar deviation ( RUD) , and elucidates how these three degrees of freedom ( DOF) combine to perform the common task of pointing , which only requires two DOF. Although pointing is more sensitive to FE and RUD than to PS and could be easily accomplished with FE and RUD alone , subjects tend to involve a small amount of PS. However , why we choose this behavior has been unknown and is the focus of this paper. Using a second-order model with lumped parameters , we tested a number of plausible control strategies involving minimization of work , potential energy , torque , and path length. None of these control schemes robustly predicted the observed behavior. However , an alternative control scheme hypothesized to control the DOF that were most important to the task ( FE and RUD) and ignore the less important DOF ( PS) , matched the observed behavior well. Moreover , the behavior observed in PS appears to be a mechanical side effect caused by unopposed interaction torques. We conclude that moderately-sized pointing movements involving the wrist and forearm are controlled by ignoring forearm rotation even though this strategy does not robustly minimize work , potential energy , torque , or path length.
