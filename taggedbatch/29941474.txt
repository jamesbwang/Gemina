 Understanding the mechanisms of cellular differentiation is challenging because differentiation is initiated by signaling pathways that drive temporally dynamic processes , which are difficult to analyze in vivo. We establish a new tool , Timer of cell kinetics and activity ( Tocky; or toki ( time in Japanese)). Tocky uses the fluorescent Timer protein , which spontaneously shifts its emission spectrum from blue to red , in combination with computer algorithms to reveal the dynamics of differentiation in vivo. Using a transcriptional target of T cell receptor ( TCR) signaling , we establish
