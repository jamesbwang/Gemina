 The parallel placebo-controlled study examined the therapeutic effects of dual-target repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS) of the motor cortex ( bilaterally) and the left prefrontal cortex ( dorsolaterally) on spontaneous and mitogen-stimulating synthesis of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by the blood cells and the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) in blood serum of patients with Parkinson 's disease. The significantly steeper positive clinical dynamics ( assessed by UPRSD scale) observed in rTMS group in comparison with the placebo group was accompanied by a significant drop in spontaneous<symptom> production<symptom> of proinflammatory cytokines IFNÎ³ and IL-17A. rTMS produced no significant effect on serum BDNF. The possible mechanisms of rTMS therapeutic action on the level of cytokines associated with neuroinflammation in patients with Parkinson 's disease are discussed.
