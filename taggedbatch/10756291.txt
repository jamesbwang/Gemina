 By increasing the number of adults seeking orthodontic treatment bonding orthodontic brackets to the surfaces other than intact enamel has become necessary. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of three different surface preparation methods associated with orthodontic bonding on porcelain color alteration. In this Orthodontic bonding changed the color parameters significantly. Mean L * , a * and b * difference were 1.35 ± 2.41 , 0.19 ± 0.80 , 0.89 ± 1.27 units , respectively ( Orthodontic treatment changed the CIE color parameters of porcelain surface. However , the color alteration is below the clinically acceptable threshold. With regard to color alteration , there is no difference between different surface conditioning methods.
