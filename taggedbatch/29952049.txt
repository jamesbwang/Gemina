 In many prescription databases , the duration of treatment for the single prescription is not recorded. This study aimed to validate 2 different types of approaches for estimating prescription durations , using the oral anticoagulant warfarin as a case. The approaches undergoing empirical validation covered assumptions of a fixed daily intake of either 0.5 or 1.0 defined daily dose ( DDD) , as well as estimates based on the reverse parametric waiting time distribution ( rWTD) , with different sets of covariates. We converted estimates of prescription duration to daily dose and compared them to prescribed daily dose as recorded in a clinical registry ( using Bland-Altman plots). Methods were compared based on their average prediction error ( logarithmic scale) and their limit of agreement ratio ( ratio of mean error Â± 1.96 SD after transformation to original scale). Estimates of daily doses were underestimated by 19 % or overestimated by 62 % when assumptions of 0.5 or 1.0 DDD were applied. The limit of agreement ratio was 6.721 for both assumptions. The rWTD-based approaches performed better when using the estimated mean value of the inter-arrival density , yielding on average negligible bias ( relative difference of 0 to 2 %) and with limit of agreement ratios decreasing upon additional covariate adjustment ( from 6.857 with no adjustment to 4.036 with the fully adjusted model). Comparing the different methods , the rWTD algorithm performed best and led to unbiased estimates of prescribed doses and thus prescription durations and reduced misclassification on the individual level upon inclusion of covariates.
