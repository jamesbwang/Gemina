 In the past few years has used thetechnique for analyzing deletions of genes , its rearrangements , cross-reactivity or multiplications in human genome affected of genetic diseases. Was proved that , the best techniques in the investigation of malignant lymphocytes are the Flow Cytometry , Elisa , ICT and Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH). Last method , FISH is used as an alternative to chromosomal banding , a conventional application in molecular medicine and can detect the chromosomal rearrangements and complexes of different genes in malignant diseases , like chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL) , acute lymphocytic leukemia<disease> , ( ALL) , or multiple myeloma ( MM). Identification of P53 gene deletions and mutations in regions of chromosome 17 in hematological malignancies is important because these mutations have an impact on the clinical management of patients.
