 Growing evidence supports that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) and coexisting obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) have poor prognosis. This association is described as overlap syndrome<disease><symptom>. Positive airway pressure ( PAP) therapy is now the preferred treatment for OSA. We hypothesized that use of PAP therapy in elderly patients with overlap syndrome<disease><symptom> would be associated with lower healthcare utilization. In this retrospective cohort study , we analyzed data from 5 % national sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with a diagnosis of COPD who were newly started on PAP therapy in 2011. We examined the effect of PAP therapy on emergency room ( ER) visits and hospitalizations for all-cause and COPD-related conditions in the 1 year pre- and 1 year post-initiation of PAP therapy. In year 2011 , we identified 319 patients with overlap syndrome<disease><symptom> who were new users of PAP therapy. In this cohort of patients , hospitalization rates for COPD-related conditions were significantly lower in the 1 year post-initiation of PAP therapy compared to the 1-year pre-initiation period ( 19.4 vs 25.4 % , P value = 0.03). However , ER visits ( for any cause or COPD-related conditions) and hospitalization rates for any cause did not differ significantly in the pre- and post-initiation periods. PAP therapy was more beneficial in older adults , those with higher COPD complexity , and those with three or more comorbidities. Initiation of PAP therapy in elderly patients with overlap syndrome<disease><symptom> is associated with a reduction in hospitalization for COPD-related conditions , but not for all-cause hospitalizations and ER visits.
