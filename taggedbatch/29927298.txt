 The present study examined the association of psychopathy , measured by the Hare<pathogen> Psychopathy Checklist-Revised ( PCL-R; Hare , 1991 , 2003) , to sexual offender treatment completion , change , and recidivism in a Canadian sample of 302 treated sexual offenders followed up in the community 17.6 years post release. Sexual violence risk and treatment change was evaluated via the Violence Risk Scale-Sexual Offense version ( Wong , Olver , Nicholaichuk , & Gordon , 2003-2017) , and general violence risk via the Sex Offender Risk Appraisal Guide ( Quinsey , Harris , Rice , & Cormier , 1998). High-psychopathy men had significantly higher rates of sexual offender treatment noncompletion ( 30 %) than low-psychopathy men ( 6 %) , although they did not evidence significantly less therapeutic change. The Affective facet of the PCL-R uniquely , significantly predicted decreased therapeutic progress , and along with the Lifestyle facet , it predicted treatment noncompletion. Examination of recidivism outcomes revealed that treatment completion in and of itself was not significantly associated with decreased sexual or violent recidivism among psychopathic offenders; however , therapeutic change , reflecting risk reduction , was significantly associated with decreased sexual and violent recidivism after controlling for baseline risk and PCL-R score. Results of survival analysis indicated that a subgroup of high-risk psychopathic men who made substantial treatment gains had lower trajectories of sexual and violent recidivism over the follow-up period relative to other high-risk men who demonstrated fewer treatment benefits. The issue of therapeutic pessimism with implications for the treatment and retention of high-psychopathy sexual offenders , per the two-component model , is discussed. ( PsycINFO Database Record
