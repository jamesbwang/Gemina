 The de Bruijn graph is fundamental to the analysis of next generation sequencing data and so , as datasets of DNA reads grow rapidly , it becomes more important to represent de Bruijn graphs compactly while still supporting fast assembly. Previous implementations of compact de Bruijn graphs have not supported node or edge deletion , however , which is important for pruning spurious elements from the graph. Belazzougui et al. ( 2016b) recently proposed a compact and fully dynamic representation , which supports exact membership queries and insertions and deletions of both nodes and edges. In this paper , we give a practical implementation of their data structure , supporting exact membership queries and fully dynamic edge operations , as well as limited support for dynamic node operations. We demonstrate experimentally that its performance is comparable to that of state-of-the-art implementations based on Bloom filters.
