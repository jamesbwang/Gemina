 Over the recent couple of decades , pharmaceutical field has embarked most phenomenal noteworthy achievements in the field of medications as well as drug delivery. The rise of Nanotechnology in this field has reformed the existing drug delivery for targeting , diagnostic , remedial applications and patient monitoring. The convincing usage of nanotechnology in the conveyance of medications that prompts an extension of novel lipid-based nanocarriers and non-liposomal systems has been discussed. Present review deals with the late advances and updates in lipidic nanocarriers , their formulation strategies , challenging aspects , stability profile , clinical applications alongside commercially available products and products under clinical trials. This exploration may give a complete idea viewing the lipid based nanocarriers as a promising choice for the formulation of pharmaceutical products , the challenges looked by the translational process of lipid-based nanocarriers and the combating methodologies to guarantee the headway of these nanocarriers from bench to bedside.
