 Knowledge of the factors controlling the diverse chemical emissions of common environmental bacteria and fungi<pathogen> is crucial because they are important signal molecules for these microbes that also could influence humans. We show here not only a high diversity of mVOCs but that their abundance can differ greatly in different environmental contexts. Microbial volatiles exhibit dynamic changes across microbial growth phases , resulting in variance of composition and emission rate of species-specific and generic mVOCs. In vitro experiments documented emissions of a wide range of mVOCs ( > 400 different chemicals) at high time resolution from diverse microbial species grown under different controlled conditions on nutrient media , or residential structural materials ( N = 54 , N
