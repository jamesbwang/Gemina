 Distributed representations of scene categories are consistent between color photographs ( CPs) and line drawings ( LDs) in the parahippocampal place area ( PPA) and the retrosplenial cortex ( RSC) , as shown using multi-voxel pattern analysis ( MVPA). Here , we used repetition suppression ( RS) to further investigate the degree of representational convergence between CPs and LDs of natural scenes. MVPA and RS can capture different aspects of visual representations , and RS may prove useful in elucidating important differences in the representations of CPs and LDs of natural scenes. We performed an event-related fMRI experiment , including image-repetitions either within-type ( i.e. , CP to CP or LD to LD) or between-types ( CP to LD , LD to CP). We found significant RS for within-type repetitions in PPA , RSC and the occipital place area ( OPA) , but did not observe RS for between-types repetitions. By contrast , scene categories were decodable from activity patterns evoked by both CPs and LDs using SVM classification for both within-type decoding and between-types cross-decoding. We conclude that there are representational differences between CPs and LDs in scene-selective cortex despite a category-level correspondence.
