 The rapid drop in sequencing costs has produced many more ( predicted) protein sequences than can feasibly be functionally annotated with wet-lab experiments. Thus , many computational methods have been developed for this purpose. Most of these methods employ homology-based inference , approximated via sequence alignments , to transfer functional annotations between proteins. The increase in the number of available sequences , however , has drastically increased the search space , thus significantly slowing down alignment methods. Here we describe homology-derived functional similarity of proteins ( HFSP) , a novel computational method that uses results of a high-speed alignment algorithm , MMseqs2 , to infer functional similarity of proteins on the basis of their alignment length and sequence identity. We show that our method is accurate ( 85 % precision) and fast ( more than 40-fold speed increase over state-of-the-art). HFSP can help correct at least a 16 % error in legacy curations , even for a resource of as high quality as Swiss-Prot. These findings suggest HFSP as an ideal resource for large-scale functional annotation efforts. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
