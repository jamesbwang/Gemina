 Diabetes mellitus ( DM) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However , its effect on procedural and follow-up performance after transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR) remains controversial. We performed an observational study of all consecutive patients treated with a transfemoral TAVR in a single-center cohort ( n = 1818). All patients were stratified by diabetes status and gender. All-cause 3-year mortality was the primary endpoint. Male patients with DM were identified to have substantially increased 3-year mortality ( 125/314 ( 39.8 %)) compared to males without DM ( 142/478 ( 29.7 %) , p < 0.01). Male patients with DM had significantly higher 3-year mortality in comparison to female patients with ( p < 0.01) or without DM ( p < 0.01). There was no difference in 3-year mortality for female patients with ( 135/465 ( 29.0 %)) and without DM ( 151/554 ( 27.3 %); p = 0.70). This increase in mortality in male DM patients was triggered by both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore , DM served as an independent predictor of 3-year mortality after TAVR selectively only in men. The interaction between male gender and diabetes mellitus was identified as an independent predictor of 3-year mortality ( HR 1.88 ( 1.25; 2.82); p < 0.01). DM did not affect 30-day mortality for the overall cohort and for males. Males with DM are a high-risk subgroup of patients after TAVR and require close medical attention including aggressive therapy of modifiable risk factors. Intensified diabetes management may improve long-term survival after TAVR.
