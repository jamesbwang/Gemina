 Pediatric granulomatous<symptom> arthritis<disease><symptom> ( PGA) refers to two formerly separate entities: autosomal dominant Blau syndrome<disease><symptom> ( BS) and its sporadic phenocopy early-onset sarcoidosis ( EOS). In 2001 BS and in 2005 EOS became explained by heterozygous mutations within the gene that encodes nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 ( NOD2) , also called caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 15 ( CARD15). NOD2 is a microbe sensor in leukocyte cytosol that activates and regulates inflammation<symptom>. PGA is characterized by a triad of autoinflammatory problems ( dermatitis<disease> , uveitis , and arthritis<disease><symptom>) in early childhood , which suggests the causal NOD2/CARD15 mutations are activating defects. Additional complications of PGA were recognized especially when NOD2 mutation analysis became generally available. However , in PGA , hypercalcemia is only briefly mentioned , and generalized osteosclerosis is not reported , although NOD2 regulates NF-ÎºB signaling essential for osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function. Herein , we report a 4-year-old girl with PGA uniquely complicated by severe 1,25 ( OH)
