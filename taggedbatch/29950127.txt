 Objective This study aimed to explore cytokine serum levels and the ratio of type 1 T helper ( Th1)/ Th2 cells in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( AECOPD). Methods A total 245 patients diagnosed with AECOPD and 193 patients who progressed to stable COPD after the initiation of treatment in hospital were selected , while a further 50 healthy individuals served as controls. All patients with COPD were diagnosed using Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria. Serum concentrations of interleukin ( IL) -2 , interferon ( IFN)- γ , IL-4 , IL-10 , IL-17 , and immunoglobulin ( Ig) E<pathogen> were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results AECOPD patients had higher levels of IL-2 , IFN-γ , IL-4 , IL-10 , IL-17 , and IgE than those with stable COPD or controls. Intriguingly , the ratios of Th1/Th2 and IL-17/ IgE were lower in AECOPD patients compared with the other two groups. These data suggest that AECOPD patients produce more IgE and have more differentiated Th2 cells than other groups. Conclusion Our findings suggest that an imbalance of circulating CD4
