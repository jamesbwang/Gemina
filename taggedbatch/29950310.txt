 Cells sense myriad signals during G1 , and a rapid response to prevent cell cycle entry is of crucial importance for proper development and adaptation. Cln3 , the most upstream G1 cyclin in budding yeast , is an extremely short-lived protein subject to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. On the other hand , nuclear accumulation of Cln3 depends on chaperones that are also important for its degradation. However , how these processes are intertwined to control G1-cyclin fate is not well understood. Here , we show that Cln3 undergoes a challenging ubiquitination step required for both degradation and full activation. Segregase Cdc48/p97 prevents degradation of ubiquitinated Cln3 , and concurrently stimulates its ER release and nuclear accumulation to trigger Start. Cdc48/p97 phosphorylation at conserved Cdk-target sites is important for recruitment of specific cofactors and , in both yeast and mammalian cells , to attain proper G1-cyclin levels and activity. Cdk-dependent modulation of Cdc48 would subjugate G1 cyclins to fast and reversible state switching , thus arresting cells promptly in G1 at developmental or environmental checkpoints , but also resuming G1 progression immediately after proliferative signals reappear.
