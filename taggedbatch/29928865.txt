 Serum anti-single stranded DNA antibody ( anti-ssDNAab) is used as a marker for systemic lupus erythematosus. We found a ` prozone-like phenomenon , ' which was different from an original prozone phenomenon , in chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay using magnetic particles for the measurement of serum anti-ssDNAab titers. We investigated mechanisms of the prozone-like phenomenon and countermeasures to prevent it from being overlooked. This study examined 679 samples from patients tested for anti-ssDNAab titer at our hospital. In addition , the BF photometry OD value 2 ( OD2) , an index of optical density , was monitored simultaneously. The undiluted samples with a prozone-like phenomenon showed extremely lower OD2. Those samples were able to be distinguished from other samples by setting OD2 criteria based on the 95 % prediction interval. Significant differences ( p < 0.05) were found in the titer ratios ( ten-fold diluted against undiluted) between groups with > 1.5 and other groups with < 1.5 for the ratios of OD2. We proposed two valuable methods to find a prozone-like phenomenon: one by setting OD2 criteria based on the 95 % prediction interval and the other by analyzing the ratios both in titers and OD2 between undiluted and 10-fold diluted samples.
