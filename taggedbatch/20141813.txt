 BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of prosthetic material and framework design on the stress within dental implants and peripheral bone using finite element analysis ( FEA). MATERIAL AND METHODS A mandibular implant-supported fixed dental prosthesis with different prosthetic materials ( cobalt-chromium-supported ceramic ( C) , zirconia-supported ceramic ( Z) , and zirconia-reinforced polymethyl methacrylate ( ZRPMMA)- supported resin ( ZP)) and different connector widths ( 2 , 3 , and 4 mm) within the framework were used to evaluate stress via FEA under oblique loading conditions. Maximum principal ( smax) , minimum principal ( smin) , and von Mises ( svM) stress values were obtained. RESULTS Minimum stress values were observed in the model with a 2-mm connector width for C and ZP. The models with 3-mm and 4-mm connector widths showed higher stress values than the model with a 2-mm connector width for C ( 48-50 %) and ZP ( 50-52 %). Similar stress values were observed in the 3- and 4-mm models. There was no significant difference in the amount of stress with Z regardless of connector width. The Z and ZP models showed similar stress values in the 3- and 4-mm models and higher stress values than in the C model. Z , ZP , and C showed the highest stress values for the model with a 2-mm connector width. CONCLUSIONS Changes in the material and width of connectors may influence stress on cortical bone , cancellous bone , and implants. C was associated with the lowest stress values. Higher maximum and minimum principal stress values were seen in cortical bone compared to cancellous bone.
