 The field of occupational health and safety ( OHS) focuses on reducing occupational accidents to an acceptable level. OHS covers systematic efforts aimed at providing employee health , safety and welfare in the workplace. This study proposes a new approach for risk assessment in the field of OHS. It integrates the Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process ( PFAHP) and fuzzy VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje ( FVIKOR) into a risk assessment process. The PFAHP is used in weighting the risk parameters. FVIKOR is then applied to prioritize the hazards. To demonstrate the applicability and validity of the proposed approach , a case study of a barrel external surface oxidation and colouring unit of a gun and rifle production facility is performed. A comparison is also provided between the proposed approach and an intuitionistic fuzzy sets-based approach. The proposed approach is found to produce reliable outcomes that better represent the vagueness of the decision-making process.
