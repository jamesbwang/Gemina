 Some adult vertebrate species , such as newts , axolotls and zebrafish , have the ability to regenerate their central nervous system ( CNS). However , the factors that establish a permissive CNS environment for correct morphological and functional regeneration in these species are not well understood. Recent evidence supports a role for retinoid signaling in the intrinsic ability of neurons , in these regeneration-competent species , to regrow after CNS injury. Previously , we demonstrated that a specific retinoic acid receptor ( RAR) subtype<pathogen> , RARβ , mediates the effects of endogenous retinoic acid ( RA) on neuronal growth and guidance in the adult newt CNS after injury. Here , we now examine the expression of the retinoid X receptor RXRα ( a potential heterodimeric transcriptional regulator with RARβ) , in newt tail and spinal<disease> cord regeneration. We show that at 21 days post-amputation ( dpa) , RXRα is expressed at temporally distinct periods and in non-overlapping spatial domains compared to RARβ. Whereas RARβ protein levels increase , RXRα proteins level decrease by 21 dpa. A selective agonist for RXR , SR11237 , prevents both this downregulation of RXRα and upregulation of RARβ and inhibits tail and caudal spinal<disease> cord regeneration. Moreover , treatment with a selective antagonist for RARβ , LE135 , inhibits regeneration with the same morphological consequences as treatment with SR11237. Interestingly , LE135 treatment also inhibits the normal downregulation of RXRα in tail and spinal<disease> cord tissues at 21 dpa. These results reveal a previously unidentified , indirect regulatory feedback loop between these two receptor subtypes in regulating the regeneration of tail and spinal<disease> cord tissues in this regeneration-competent newt.
