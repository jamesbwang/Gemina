 Muscle-invasive bladder cancer ( MIBC) is an aggressive disease for which treatment strategies are continuously evolving. We characterized trends in treatment modalities for MIBC from 2004 to 2013 ( the `` pre-immunotherapy era '') and identified predictors of receiving the current standard of care treatment: neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC) followed by radical cystectomy ( RC). We used the National Cancer Database to identify individuals diagnosed with clinically localized MIBC from 2004 to 2013. We calculated the yearly prevalence of NAC followed by RC , RC as first treatment , trimodal therapy , chemotherapy and/or radiation alone , and no treatment. We then identified factors associated with receiving NAC prior to RC. There was a notable increase in the use of NAC followed by RC over the study period , from 3.68 % in 2004 to 14.83 % in 2013 ( P < 0.001). Factors associated with decreased odds of receiving this regimen included being older , Black , uninsured , less educated , and more burdened by comorbidities. Rates of trimodal therapy and chemotherapy and/or radiation alone remained relatively constant ( approximately 5 and 17 % , respectively). There was a consistent decline in the proportion of patients who did not receive any treatment , down to 34.20 % in 2013. Trends in localized MIBC treatment have evolved substantially since the early 2000s , and certain patient characteristics are associated with lower odds of receiving the current standard of care. This serves as a foundation from which to judge the impact of the upcoming immunotherapy era on the treatment landscape for this disease.
