 To use serological and multiplex polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) assays to examine sputum<symptom> samples from patients experiencing acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( AECOPD) for the presence of atypical pathogens , including Mycoplasma<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , Chlamydia<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , and Legionella<pathogen> pneumophila<pathogen>. From September 2012 to February 2014 , 341 patients with AECOPD attending outpatient clinics were enrolled as part of a randomized , double-blind , multicenter study. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure serum immunoglobulin M ( IgM) and IgG antibody titers on the first day of the study and at 36 days post-enrollment. Multiplex PCR was used to test sputum<symptom> samples for the presence of atypical pathogens. A urinary antigen test for L.<pathogen> pneumophila<pathogen> was performed on the first day. Nineteen patients ( 5.6 %) showed serological evidence of acute<disease> infection<disease> with M.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen>. Also , one and seven patients ( 2 %) showed serological evidence of acute<disease> infection<disease> with C.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> and L.<pathogen> pneumophila<pathogen> , respectively. All DNA samples were negative for M.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , C.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , and L.<pathogen> pneumophila<pathogen> according to PCR. Only one urine sample was positive for L.<pathogen> pneumophila<pathogen> antigen , but serologic evidence was lacking. Serological testing suggested that infection by atypical pathogens during AECOPD was relatively uncommon. In addition , PCR provided no direct evidence of infection by atypical pathogens. Thus , atypical pathogens may not be a major cause of AECOPD in South Korea.
