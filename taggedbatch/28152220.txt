 vSim ® for Nursing is the first web-based platform linked to the nursing education curriculum. It is an American simulation tool , developed in 2014 through a collaboration between Wolters Kluwer Health , Laerdal Medical and the National League for Nursing. To our knowledge , no studies have evaluated vSim ® for Nursing from the nursing students ' perspective in Norway. The aim of the study was to evaluate second year Norwegian nursing students ' experiences with the virtual clinical simulation scenario in surgical nursing from vSim ® for Nursing. A descriptive and a convergent mixed method design was utilised. The method comprised a 7-item questionnaire with five open-ended questions. Sixty-five nursing students participated in the study. The majority of Norwegian nursing students evaluated the virtual clinical scenario in surgical nursing from vSim ® for Nursing useful , realistic and educational in preparing for clinical placement in surgical care. However , a small portion of the nursing students had trouble understanding and navigating the American vSim ® for Nursing program. Introducing virtual simulation tools into the nursing education encompasses faculty and student preparation , guidance from faculty members during the simulation session and support for students who are facing difficulties with the simulation program.
