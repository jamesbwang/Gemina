 Avian influenza<pathogen><disease> viruses , including highly pathogenic strains , pose severe economic , animal and public health concerns. We implemented live bird market surveillance in Bangladesh to identify the subtypes of avian influenza<pathogen><disease> A viruses in domestic waterfowl and market environments. We collected waterfowl samples monthly from 4 rural sites from 2007 to 2012 and environmental samples from 4 rural and 16 urban sites from 2009 to 2012. Samples were tested through real-time RT-PCR , virus culture , and sequencing to detect and characterize avian influenza<pathogen><disease> A viruses. Among 4,308 waterfowl tested , 191 ( 4.4 %) were positive for avian influenza<pathogen><disease> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , including 74 ( 1.9 %) avian influenza<pathogen><disease> A/H5 subtype. The majority ( 99 % , n = 73) of the influenza<pathogen><disease> A/H5-positive samples were from healthy appearing waterfowl. Multiple subtypes , including H1N1<pathogen> , H1N3 , H3N2<pathogen> , H3N6 , H3N8<pathogen> , H4N1 , H4N2 , H4N6<pathogen> , H5N1<pathogen> ( clades 2.2.2 , 2.3.2.1 a , 2.3.4.2) , H5N2<pathogen> , H6N1 , H7N9 , H9N2<pathogen> , H11N2 and H11N3 , H11N6 were detected in waterfowl and environmental samples. Environmental samples tested positive for influenza<pathogen><disease> A<pathogen> viruses throughout the year. Avian influenza<pathogen><disease> viruses , including H5N1<pathogen> and H9N2<pathogen> subtypes were also identified in backyard and small-scale raised poultry. Live bird markets could be high-risk sites for harboring the viruses and have the potential to infect naive birds and humans exposed to them.
