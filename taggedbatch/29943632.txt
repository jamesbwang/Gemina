 OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of each of 3 incremental doses of MK-467 for alleviation of dexmedetomidine-induced hemodynamic depression<symptom> in isoflurane-anesthetized cats. ANIMALS 6 healthy adult domestic shorthair cats. PROCEDURES Each cat was anesthetized with isoflurane and received a target-controlled infusion of dexmedetomidine estimated to maintain the plasma dexmedetomidine concentration at 10 ng/mL throughout the experiment. Heart rate ( HR) and direct arterial pressures were measured at baseline ( isoflurane administration only) , during dexmedetomidine infusion , and before and after IV administration of each of 3 serially increasing doses ( 15 , 30 , and 60 μg/kg) of MK-467. Cardiac index ( CI) and systemic vascular resistance ( SVR) were recorded at baseline , during dexmedetomidine infusion , and at the mean arterial pressure nadir after administration of the 30- and 60-μg/kg doses of MK-467. RESULTS Compared with baseline values , the dexmedetomidine infusion significantly decreased HR and increased arterial pressures. Each dose of MK-467 caused a significant decrease in arterial pressures and a significant , albeit clinically irrelevant , increase in HR ( ≤ 10 %). Following administration of the 30- and 60-μg/kg doses of MK-467 , all cats developed clinical hypotension<symptom> ( mean arterial pressure , < 60 mm Hg) even though CI and SVR returned to baseline values. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated administration of small doses of MK-467 to isoflurane-anesthetized cats receiving dexmedetomidine restored CI and SVR , but caused a substantial decrease in arterial pressures and only a marginal increase in HR. Therefore , caution should be used when MK-467 is administered to alleviate dexmedetomidine-induced hemodynamic depression<symptom> in isoflurane-anesthetized cats.
