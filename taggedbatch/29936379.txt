 This was a comparative study of the heavy metal levels ( Zn , Pb , Cd , Co , Mn , Fe , Cr and Cu) in eggs from free grazing duck , small-scale , and large-scale farms in central and western regions of Thailand. A questionnaire was used to gather demographic data for the analysis of heavy metal contamination in feed , drinking water and wastewater. The correlation between the amounts of heavy metal contamination in eggs was studied against the heavy metals found in feed , drinking water and wastewater. The levels of Pb , Cd , Cr and Cu in eggs from large-scale farms were significantly higher than small farms and free grazing farms at P < 0.001. Zn in eggs from free grazing farms was higher than in the small farms and large-scale farms sampled. The contamination of Pb in eggs from all types of farms exceeded the standard limits of ACFS 6703-2005. The average levels of Pb in the eggs from small-scale farms correlated significantly with the level of Pb found in the feed at P < 0.05 , while the average levels of Pb in eggs from free grazing duck farms correlated significantly with the levels of Pb found in the drinking water at P < 0.05. Additionally , the average level of Cu in duck egg from large-scale farms correlated significantly with the level of Cu found in the feeds at P < 0.001. Furthermore , from a calculation of the provisional tolerable daily intake ( WHO-FAO) of heavy metals in this study , it was concluded that consumers face health risks from Cd contamination. Thus , heavy metal contamination , especially Pb and Cd in duck egg , must be of concern due to the health risks and the route of crucial heavy metals contamination should be elucidated and long- term monitoring of heavy metals posing health effects in farm systems should be carried out.
