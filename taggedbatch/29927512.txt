 Reactive perforating dermatosis is a rare chronic skin disease defined by the transepidermal elimination of collagen and/or elastin. In the acquired form in adults , it is frequently associated with diseases such as diabetes and chronic renal<symptom> failure<symptom>. No systematic reviews of treatment options are available for this disease. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize all reported treatment options for acquired reactive perforating dermatosis ( ARPD). This is a systematic review based on a MEDLINE search of articles in English and German from 1990 to 2016. Most medical literature on the treatment of ARPD is limited to individual case reports and small series of patients. Various therapies that have been tried include antihistamines , topical keratolytics , corticosteroids , tretinoin , oral drugs such as allopurinol or antibiotics , and phototherapy or photochemotherapy. While there are no specific criteria for the evidence-based selection of treatment options for ARPD , the first priority in management of these conditions should be treatment of an underlying disease if present. None of the described modalities has been approved for first-line therapy. It is recommended to choose a combination of drugs that reduce itching and assist in the resolution of the skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> at the same time.
