 Langerhans cell histiocytosis ( LCH) is regarded as a clonal disease , usually carrying the activating BRAF mutation V600E. Although LCH theoretically may affect all types of human tissue and typically appears during childhood , temporal bone involvement in adult patients is exceedingly rare. We report an atypical case of a 56-year-old man as one of the oldest patients diagnosed with temporal bone involvement of a BRAF-negative LCH , which caused painless otorrhea and hearing loss. Cutaneous manifestation ( multifocal multisystem LCH , also known as Letterer-Siwe disease) was later recognized incidentally. Administration of ifosfamide plus doxorubicin and mesna with supplementary irradiation resulted in a temporary remission followed by slow but constant tumor progression , which after 2.5 years became resistant to treatment with cytarabine and dasatinib. Attempts at therapy ( cladribine) to achieve cure are ongoing.
