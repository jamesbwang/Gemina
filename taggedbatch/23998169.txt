 We present an extensive review of the literature to date pertaining to the rationale for using a spacer/valved holding chamber ( VHC) to deliver inhaled therapy from a pressurised , metered-dose inhaler , a discussion of how the properties of individual devices may vary according to their physical characteristics and materials of manufacture , the potential risks and benefits of ancillaries such as valves , and the evidence that they contribute tangibly to the delivery of therapy. We also reiterate practical recommendations for the correct usage and maintenance of spacers/VHCs , which we trust offer practical help and advice to patients and healthcare professionals alike.
