 Cardiovascular stent restenosis remains a major challenge in interventional treatment of cardiovascular occlusive disease. Although the changes in arterial mechanical environment due to stent implantation are the main causes of the initiation of restenosis and thrombosis , the mechanisms that cause this initiation are still not fully understood. In this article , we reviewed the studies on the issue of stent-induced alterations in arterial mechanical environment and discussed their roles in stent restenosis and late thrombosis from three aspects: ( i) the interaction of the stent with host blood vessel , involve the response of vascular wall , the mechanism of mechanical signal transmission , the process of re-endothelialization and late thrombosis; ( ii) the changes of hemodynamics in the lumen of the vascular segment and ( iii) the changes of mechanical microenvironment within the vascular segment wall due to stent implantation. This review has summarized and analyzed current work in order to better solve the two main problems after stent implantation , namely in stent restenosis and late thrombosis , meanwhile propose the deficiencies of current work for future reference.
