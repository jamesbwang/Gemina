 Modifications in working conditions can accommodate changing needs of chronically ill persons. The self-employed may have more possibilities than employees to modify their working conditions. We investigate how working conditions change following diagnosis of chronic<disease> disease<disease> for employed and self-employed older persons. We used waves 2-7 from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing ( ELSA). We included 1389 participants aged 50-60 years who reported no chronic<disease> disease<disease> at baseline. Using fixed-effects linear regression analysis , we investigated how autonomy , physical and psychosocial job demands and working hours changed following diagnosis of chronic<disease> disease<disease>. For employees , on diagnosis of chronic<disease> disease<disease> autonomy marginally decreased ( -0.10 , 95 % CI -0.20 to 0.00) and physical job demands significantly increased ( 0.13 , 95 % CI 0.01 to 0.25) , whereas for the self-employed autonomy did not significantly change and physical job demands decreased on diagnosis of chronic<disease> disease<disease> ( -0.36 , 95 % CI -0.64 to -0.07) , compared with prediagnosis levels. Psychosocial job demands did not change on diagnosis of chronic<disease> disease<disease> for employees or the self-employed. Working hours did not change for employees , but dropped for self-employed ( although non-significantly) by about 2.8 hours on diagnosis of chronic<disease> disease<disease> ( -2.78 , 95 % CI -6.03 to 0.48). Improvements in working conditions after diagnosis of chronic<disease> disease<disease> were restricted to the self-employed. This could suggest that workplace adjustments are necessary after diagnosis of chronic<disease> disease<disease> , but that the self-employed are more likely to realise these. Policy seeking to extend working life should consider work ( place) adjustments for chronically ill workers as a means to prevent early exit from work.
