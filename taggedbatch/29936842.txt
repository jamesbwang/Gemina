 Nanomedicine relies on the effective internalization of nanoparticles combined with polymeric nanocarriers into living cells. Thus , exploration of internalization is essential for improving the efficacy of nanoparticle-based strategies in clinical practice. Here , we investigated the physicochemical internalization of gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs) conjugated with hydrophobic polyampholytes into cell-sized liposomes at a low but nonfrozen temperature. The hydrophobic polyampholytes localized in the disordered phase of the membrane , and internalization of AuNPs was enhanced in the presence of hydrophobic polyampholytes together with incubation at -3 °C as compared to 25 °C. These results contribute toward a mechanistic understanding for developing a model nanomaterials-driven delivery system based on hydrophobic polyampholytes and low temperature.
