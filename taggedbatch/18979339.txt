 This study aims to clarify the ideal technique for running on a curved path during sprinting events. Participants were twelve male track and field athletes including long jumpers and sprinters. The participants performed a 60-m sprint with maximal effort on straight and curved paths. Participants were divided into `` good curve runners '' and `` poor curve runners '' according to the curved path running speed relative to that of the straight path. Kinematic variables and ground reaction forces ( GRFs) were registered and compared between the groups and paths. The running speed , step length , and flight distance of the outside leg on the curved path were lower than on the straight path only in poor curve runners. The medial-lateral GRF and impulse showed an increase during curved path running for both groups. However , the maximum posterior GRF and impulse decreased only in poor curve runners. The ideal technique for running on a curved path is to maintain the same kinematics and kinetics in the sagittal plane as on a straight path.
