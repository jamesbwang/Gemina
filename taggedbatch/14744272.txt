 To test the effectiveness of topical EMLA cream ( lidocaine 2.5 % and prilocaine 2.5 %) for pain control during femoral artery catheterization for neuro-endovascular procedures in adult patients. The body habitus overlying the femoral arterial pulsation was graded as: ( 1) pubic symphysis and iliac crest bone protuberances visualized; ( 2) Pubic Symphysis and Iliac Crest bone protuberances not seen but easily palpable; ( 3) Pubic Symphysis and Iliac Crest bone protuberances palpable with considerable difficulty; and ( 4) abdominal layers fold over the femoral region. The severity of pain at femoral artery catheterization was classified using a numeric rating scale score ranging from 0 ( no pain) to 10 ( worst pain). The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with excellent ( score of ≤ 1) and failed pain control ( score of ≥ 8). The mean ( ± SD) and median numeric rating scale scores were 2.4 ± 2.7 and 1 , respectively , in 186 patients included. The proportion of patients with excellent pain control was 49.4 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 42.1 % -56.7 %) and failed pain control was 6.9 % ( 95 % CI 4.1 % -11.6 %). The body habitus was graded as 1 ( Topical EMLA cream as an adjunct to local lidocaine infiltration was associated with very low rates of failed pain control during femoral artery catheterization despite a relatively high rate of unfavorable body habitus.
