 BACKGROUND Pentraxin-3 ( PTX3) is considered a high quality inflammatory marker of the severity and prognosis of several diseases , however , the value of PTX3 in thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke remains unclear and PTX3 is still controversial in evaluating the prognosis of stroke patients. In this study , we investigated the association of PTX3 with thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-seven stroke patients who received thrombolytic therapy within 4.5 hours after symptom onset were enrolled consecutively between July 2016 and June 2017. All the patients underwent multiphase CTA ( computerized tomography angiography) or CT perfusion before thrombolysis with no indication for endovascular treatment. Initial and 24 hours of National Institute of Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS) scores and serum PTX3 level , stroke risk factors and predictors , and mRS ( modified Rankin scale) at 3 months were collected prospectively. Predictors of thrombolytic therapy effect and long-term prognosis were investigated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS The 24 hour NIHSS score and the treatment time was associated with symptom improvement , while the PTX3 level had no association with neurological improvement and prognosis in stroke patients receiving thrombolytic therapy. CONCLUSIONS PTX3 is not suitable to serve as an indicator of thrombolytic efficacy and had no association with long-term prognosis in stroke patients receiving thrombolytic therapy.
