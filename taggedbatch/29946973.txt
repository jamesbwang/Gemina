 Diagnosis and management of adult individuals with low bone mass and increased bone fragility before the age of 50 can be challenging. A number of these patients are diagnosed with mild osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI) through detection of COL1A1 or COL1A2 mutations; however , a clinical differentiation from early-onset osteoporosis ( EOOP) may be difficult. The purpose of this study was to determine the bone microstructural differences between mild OI and EOOP patients. 29 patients showed mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2 and were classified as OI. Skeletal assessment included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA) , high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography ( HR-pQCT) , and bone turnover serum analyses. Bone microstructure of 21/29 OI patients was assessed and compared to 23 age- and sex-matched patients clinically classified EOOP but without mutations in the known disease genes as well as to 20 healthy controls. In the OI patients , we did not observe an age-dependent decrease in DXA Z-scores. HR-pQCT revealed a significant reduction in volumetric BMD and microstructural parameters in the distal radius and tibia in both the OI and EOOP cohorts compared to the healthy controls. When comparing the bone microstructure of OI patients with the EOOP cohort , significant differences were found in terms of bone geometry in the radius , while no significant changes were detected in all other HR-pQCT parameters at the radius and tibia. Taken together , adult mild OI patients demonstrate a predominantly high bone turnover trabecular bone loss syndrome<disease><symptom> that shows minor microstructural differences compared to EOOP without mutation detection.
