 To identify the evidence base and evaluate the efficacy of each treatment for postural tachycardia<symptom> syndrome<disease><symptom> ( POTS) in light of a recent consensus statement highlighting the lack of treatment options with clear benefit to risk ratios for this debilitating condition. The CENTRAL ( Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) , PubMed , and Embase databases from inception to May 2017 were searched using the terms postural AND tachycardia<symptom> AND syndrome<disease><symptom>. A total of 135 full-text publications were screened after excluding duplicates ( n = 681) , conference abstracts ( n = 467) , and records that did not relate to POTS therapy ( n = 876). We included 28 studies with at least 4 patients with POTS in which symptomatic response was reported after more than 4 weeks of therapy. This review was performed according to the PRISMA ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. Two investigators independently performed the data extraction and evaluated the quality of evidence. This study comprised 25 case series and 3 small randomized controlled trials that evaluated 755 and 103 patients with POTS , respectively. Interventions directed at increasing intravascular volume , increasing peripheral or splanchnic vascular tone , controlling heart rate , and increasing exercise tolerance demonstrate moderate efficacy ( range , 51 % -72 %). Few data exist on their comparative effectiveness. Significant heterogeneities were seen in terms of patient age , symptom severity , and the measures used to evaluate treatment efficacy. The current evidence base to guide optimal management of patients with POTS is extremely limited. More high-quality collaborative research with standardized reporting of symptom response<symptom> and treatment tolerability is urgently needed.
