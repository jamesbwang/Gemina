 Pig farming is an important activity in the economic development of Mexico with millions of tons of meat produced annually. Antibiotics are used in therapeutic dose to prevent diseases , and sometimes as growth promoters. These compounds are not completely metabolized; they are carried into the environment in its active form at concentrations that could induce antibiotic resistance in bacteria , which could be transferred to human pathogens by horizontal gene transfer. The objective of this work was to develop methods of analysis for simultaneous quantification of the antibiotics Oxytetracycline ( OXT) , Chlortetracycline ( CLT) , Enrofloxacin ( ENRO) and Ciprofloxacin ( CIPRO) by field-amplified sampling injection in capillary zone electrophoresis ( FASI-CZE). The method was validated by parameters of ( 1) linearity , obtaining a lineal range of 0.05 at 1 Î¼g mL
