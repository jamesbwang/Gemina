 The aim of this study was to determine the gene expression associated with the persistence of a Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> stationary phase population when facing lethal nisin treatment METHODS: RNA Seq analysis was used for gene expression profiling of the persister cells in rich medium ( persister TN) compared with untreated cells ( non-persister). The results were confirmed using RT PCR. Functional genes associated with the persister populations were identified in multiple systems , such as heat shock<symptom> related stress response , cell wall synthesis , ATP-binding cassette ( ABC) transport system , phosphotransferase system ( PTS system) , and SOS/DNA repair. This study pointed to genetic regulation of persister cells exposed to lethal nisin and provides some insight into possible mechanisms of impeding bacterial persistence.
