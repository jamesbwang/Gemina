 Human genetic studies have indicated that plasma lipoprotein ( a) ( Lp ( a)) is causally associated with the risk of coronary heart disease ( CHD) , but randomized trials of several therapies that reduce Lp ( a) levels by 25 % to 35 % have not provided any evidence that lowering Lp ( a) level reduces CHD risk. To estimate the magnitude of the change in plasma Lp ( a) levels needed to have the same evidence of an association with CHD risk as a 38.67-mg/ dL ( ie , 1-mmol/L) change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C) level , a change that has been shown to produce a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of CHD. A mendelian randomization analysis was conducted using individual participant data from 5 studies and with external validation using summarized data from 48 studies. Population-based prospective cohort and case-control studies featured 20793 individuals with CHD and 27540 controls with individual participant data , whereas summarized data included 62240 patients with CHD and 127299 controls. Data were analyzed from November 2016 to March 2018. Genetic LPA score and plasma Lp ( a) mass concentration. Coronary heart disease. Of the included study participants , 53 % were men , all were of white European ancestry , and the mean age was 57.5 years. The association of genetically predicted Lp ( a) with CHD risk was linearly proportional to the absolute change in Lp ( a) concentration. A 10-mg/dL lower genetically predicted Lp ( a) concentration was associated with a 5.8 % lower CHD risk ( odds ratio ( OR) , 0.942; 95 % CI , 0.933-0.951; P = 3 × 10-37) , whereas a 10-mg/dL lower genetically predicted LDL-C level estimated using an LDL-C genetic score was associated with a 14.5 % lower CHD risk ( OR , 0.855; 95 % CI , 0.818-0.893; P = 2 × 10-12). Thus , a 101.5-mg/ dL change ( 95 % CI , 71.0-137.0) in Lp ( a) concentration had the same association with CHD risk as a 38.67-mg/ dL change in LDL-C level. The association of genetically predicted Lp ( a) concentration with CHD risk appeared to be independent of changes in LDL-C level owing to genetic variants that mimic the relationship of statins , PCSK9 inhibitors , and ezetimibe with CHD risk. The clinical benefit of lowering Lp ( a) is likely to be proportional to the absolute reduction in Lp ( a) concentration. Large absolute reductions in Lp ( a) of approximately 100 mg/dL may be required to produce a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of CHD similar in magnitude to what can be achieved by lowering LDL-C level by 38.67 mg/dL ( ie , 1 mmol/L).
