 As two-dimensional ( 2D) transition metal dichalcogenides electronic devices are scaled down to the sub-micrometer regime , the active layers of these materials are exposed to high lateral electric fields , resulting in electrical breakdown. In this regard , understanding the intrinsic nature in layer-stacked 2D semiconducting materials under high lateral electric fields is necessary for the reliable applications of their field-effect transistors. Here , we explore the electrical breakdown phenomena originating from avalanche multiplication in MoS
