 Aim was to develop a full automatic clustering approach of the time-activity curves ( TAC) from dynamic 18F-FET PET and evaluate its association with IDH1 mutation status and survival in patients with gliomas. Thirty-seven patients ( mean age: 45 Â± 13 y) with newly diagnosed gliomas and dynamic 18F-FET PET before any histopathologic investigation or treatment were retrospectively included. Each dynamic 18F-FET PET was realigned to the first image and spatially normalized in the Montreal Neurological Institute template. A tumor mask was semi-automatically generated from Z-score maps. Each brain tumor voxel was clustered in one of the 3 following centroids using dynamic time warping and k-means clustering ( centroid # 1: slowly increasing slope; centroid # 2: rapidly increasing followed by slowly decreasing slope; and centroid # 3: rapidly increasing followed by rapidly decreasing slope). The percentage of each dynamic 18F-FET TAC within tumors and other conventional 18F-FET PET parameters ( maximum and mean tumor-to-brain ratios ( TBRmax and TBRmean) , time-to-peak ( TTP) and slope) was compared between wild-type and IDH1 mutant tumors. Their prognostic value was assessed in terms of progression free-survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Twenty patients were IDH1 wild-type and 17 IDH1 mutant. Higher percentage of centroid # 1 and centroid # 3 within tumors were positively ( P = 0.016) and negatively ( P = 0.01) correlated with IDH1 mutated status. Also , TBRmax , TBRmean , TTP , and slope discriminated significantly between tumors with and without IDH1 mutation ( P range 0.01 to 0.04). Progression occurred in 22 patients ( 59 %) at a median of 13.1 months ( 7.6-37.6 months) and 13 patients ( 35 %) died from tumor progression. Patients with a percentage of centroid # 1 > 90 % had a longer survival compared with those with a percentage of centroid # 1 < 90 % ( P = 0.003 for PFS and P = 0.028 for OS). This remained significant after stratification on IDH1 mutation status ( P = 0.029 for PFS and P = 0.034 for OS). Compared to other conventional 18F-FET PET parameters , TTP and slope were associated with PFS and OS ( P range 0.009 to 0.04). Based on dynamic 18F-FET PET acquisition , we developed a full automatic clustering approach of TAC which appears to be a valuable noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic marker in patients with gliomas.
