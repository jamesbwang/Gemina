 Modern large-scale agricultural practices that incorporate high density farming with subtherapeutic antibiotic dosing are considered a major contributor to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections of humans with species of Salmonella<pathogen><disease> being a leading agriculture-based bacterial infection. Microcin J25 , a potent and highly stable antimicrobial peptide active against Enterobacteriaceae , is a candidate antimicrobial against multiple Salmonella<pathogen><disease> species. Emerging evidence supports the hypothesis that the composition of the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract prevents a variety of diseases by preventing infectious<disease> agents<disease> from proliferating. Reducing clearance of off-target bacteria may decrease susceptibility to secondary infection. Of the Enterobacteriaceae susceptible to microcin J25 , Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> are the most abundant within the human gut. To explore the modulation of specificity , a collection of 207 mutants encompassing 12 positions in both the ring and loop of microcin J25 was built and tested for activity against Salmonella<pathogen><disease> and E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strains. As has been found previously , mutational tolerance of ring residues was lower than loop residues , with 22 % and 51 % of mutations , respectively , retaining activity toward at least one target within the target organism test panel. The multitarget screening elucidated increased mutational tolerance at position G2 , G3 , and G14 than previously identified in panels composed of single targets. Multiple mutations conferred differential response between the different targets. Examination of specificity differences between mutants found that 30 % showed significant improvements to specificity toward any of the targets. Generation and testing of a combinatorial library designed from the point-mutant study revealed that microcin J25
