 Alcohol use among college students increases during spring break , which often results in more alcohol-related consequences. Given the rates of heavy alcohol use among Greek-life college students , this population may be particularly at risk for experiencing negative outcomes during this time. Thus , the current study utilized a Deviance Regulation Theory ( DRT)- based approach to increase the use of protective behavioral strategies ( PBS) among Greek-life college students during spring break. Greek-life college students going on spring break ( n = 89) completed a screening before being randomly assigned to a pre-spring break condition ( i.e. , either a positively or negatively framed message about peers who do or do not use PBS during spring break). Participants then completed a post-spring break assessment of alcohol and PBS use over spring break ( n = 70). There were no observed DRT effects on manner of drinking or stopping/limiting PBS use during spring break. However , there were effects on Harm Reduction PBS ( HR PBS). In the positive frame , HR PBS use was positively associated with PBS norm discrepancy ( the difference between spring break specific PBS norms and typical PBS norms). While these associations did not result in lower alcohol consumption , HR PBS was inversely associated with risk-related alcohol problems , but not other types of alcohol problems. A brief DRT-based approach may increase specific PBS types during spring break and may reduce risk-related alcohol-related problems among Greek-life students during spring break.
