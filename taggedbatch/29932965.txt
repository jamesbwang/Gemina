 Lincosamide resistance in staphylococci is based on the expression of a number of genes which specify three major resistance mechanisms: ( i) enzymatic inactivation by lincosamide nucleotidyltransferases , ( ii) ribosome protection by ABC-F proteins , and ( iii) methylation of the ribosomal target sites in the 23S rRNA by Cfr or Erm methylases. So far , only two lnu genes , lnu ( A) and lnu ( B) , which code for different types of lincosamide nucleotidyltransferases , have been found in staphylococci. The ABC-F proteins are encoded by genes of the vga , lsa and sal classes. The corresponding proteins exhibit ATP-binding domains , but lack transmembrane regions. So far , vga ( A) genes- including the variant genes vga ( A)
