 Based largely on the so-called problem of `` asymmetry in concept application '' , philosopher Murat Aydede has argued for a non-perceptual view of pain. Aydede is of course not denying basic neurobiological facts about neurons , action potentials , and the like , but he nonetheless makes a strong philosophical case for pain not being the perception of something extramental. In the present paper , after having stated some of the presuppositions I hold as a physician and pain researcher , and after having shortly described Aydede 's critique of perceptual theories of pain , I make a constructive proposal centred around the concept of pain as the perception of some-one , not some-thing. In doing so , I propose that there often is a problematic duality at work when we think about pain , namely the mental/extramental duality. This pre-reflective mindset creates difficulties when reflecting over pain. Instead , I propose the body/world duality as being more helpful. Two neologisms , cosmoception and egoception , are presented as an alternative to the twin concepts of exteroception and interoception. It is argued that the new concepts have the advantage of not pushing our thought into a mental/extra-mental dichotomy. Hence , when in pain ( which is an instance of egoception) , I get epistemic access to the body that is I , to how I fare in this world. From that perspective , pain is not the perception of something , but of someone-namely , the self. In the final part of the paper , this proposal is discussed in dialogue with a paper from phenomenological thinker Jennifer Bullington.
