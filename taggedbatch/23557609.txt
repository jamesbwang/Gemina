 To evaluate the anticoagulation efficacy of dabigatran etexilate for left atrial appendage ( LAA) thrombus resolution in patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> by transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography , and to investigate the anticoagulation factors.A total of 58 atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> patients with LAA thrombus in our hospital were enrolled. After dabigatran etexilate anticoagulation for 3 months , the patients were divided into the effective group and ineffective group according to dissolution of thrombosis. The baseline data and the left atrial diameter ( LAD) , left atrial ejection fraction ( LAEF) , left ventricular ejection fraction , LAA flow velocity ( LAA-v) , and LAA thrombus size before and after anticoagulation treatment were recorded , and the measurement index were statistically analyzed.After the patients received anticoagulation treatment for 3 months , 15 patients had complete dissolution , thrombus in 21 patients reduced significantly , and the complete dissolution rate was 25.9 % ( 15/58) , the effective rate of dissolution was 62.1 % ( 36/58). Compared with the ineffective group , the proportion of persistent atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> and LAD in effective group were lower than those in the ineffective group , the LAEF and LAA-v in the effective group were higher than those in the ineffective group , and the differences were statistically significant ( P < .05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis on the baseline data and each ultrasound index showed that the type of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> , LAD , LAEF , and LAA-v were independently associated with the efficacy of anticoagulation ( P < .05). Dabigatran etexilate is effective in dissolution of LAA thrombus in patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> , and the atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> type , LAD , LAEF , and LAA-v are significantly related with the efficacy of anticoagulation.
