 In this study , we aim to assess types and levels of psychosocial needs in adolescents and young adults ( AYAs) who have a parent with cancer. And define and describe the variables analyzing the demographic characteristics. This descriptive study with cross-sectional design was conducted on 217 participants from five hospitals in Tehran. By use of the `` Offspring Cancer Needs Instrument , '' in adolescents and young adults who had the inclusion criteria , information about the psychosocial needs were collected. Also , a demographic questionnaire was completed by the participants. Mean and standard deviation calculated for each domain and overall scores. Independent t test and one-way ANOVA was used for the comparison of needs ' mean and demographic variables. Total scores ' mean was 126 and among domains , the `` information '' got the highest and the `` support from friends '' the lowest mean. Among demographic variables , we found a relationship between parent education ( p value = 0.007) , treatment statue ( p value = 0.015) , parent gender ( p value = 0.018) , and parent-child relationship ( p value = 0.027) with the level of psychosocial needs. In this target group of adolescents and young adults , the need for `` information '' is the strongest domain of psychosocial need during parent cancer trajectory.
