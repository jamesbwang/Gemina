 Current treatment algorithms for stable juvenile osteochondritis dissecans ( JOCD) of the knee have not been established. For arthroscopically stable lesion<symptom> , in-situ arthroscopic fixation with bioabsorbable pins was introduced as a more desirable approach because of less surgical morbidity and faster recovery. However , there is a paucity of literature that concludes on its efficacy. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy and limitation of in-situ arthroscopic fixation on stable JOCD lesion<symptom> in the knee. Ninety-six patients with 110 affected knees were reviewed. Subsequently , patients who underwent in-situ arthroscopic fixation for arthroscopically stable JOCD lesions<symptom> were grouped for further analysis. Arthroscopic lesion<symptom> stability was graded according to the Guhl 's grading system from the surgical description of each lesion<symptom>. The grade I and II were defined as ` stable ' lesions<symptom>. The lesion<symptom> status was also evaluated with the MRI grading system described by Dipaola in preoperative images retrospectively. The grade I and II lesions<symptom> were also defined as ` stable ' and more than III as ` unstable '. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by the Lysholm score at the final office visit. If the patient had a revision surgery , the case was classified as a complete failure. There were 13 lesions<symptom> in 13 patients with open physis treated with in-situ arthroscopic fixation using bioabsorbable pins. In this population , radiographical lesion<symptom> status and the Lysholm score were significantly improved in 10 cases ( preoperative: 77.5 ± 11.2 , postoperative: 98.9 ± 3.1 , P = 0.002); however , we found three revision cases ( failure rate , 23 %). Of these revision cases , all lesions<symptom> were graded as ` unstable ' in MRI. In this series , the failure rate was 23 % for in-situ arthroscopic fixation for arthroscopically stable JOCD lesion<symptom> of the knee. Because of the potential risk for underestimation of lesion<symptom> instability , we strongly suggest that this less invasive approach should be chosen with great care for the lesion<symptom> that presents arthroscopically stable , but as unstable status on MRI.
