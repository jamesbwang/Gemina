 Combination regimens with anti-CD20 agents might improve the outcomes of patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies; however , the available comparative clinical evidence is limited. The present review assessed the reported evidence on the efficacy of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies combined with chemotherapy for patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL) , follicular lymphoma ( FL) , or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL) , using a rapid evidence assessment approach. MEDLINE , Embase , and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 1 , 1997 to July 14 , 2017 ( English language only). The data identified from randomized controlled trials or single-arm prospective studies are reported as descriptive study summaries , grouped by anti-CD20 agent and outcome ( overall response rate , including complete response and partial response; duration of response; survival , including overall survival and progression-free survival). Of 56 included reports , 32 reported on CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma , 15 on FL , and 11 on DLBCL. Within the study period , 40 , 11 , and 7 studies evaluated rituximab , ofatumumab , and obinutuzumab , respectively. Substantially more data were available for rituximab-based combination regimens than for either ofatumumab or obinutuzumab. Moreover , substantial heterogeneity was recorded in the study design and backbone chemotherapy. Thus , the available data are inconclusive regarding any potential similarities or differences in efficacy among these anti-CD20 agents for each respective disease. More importantly , only 1 direct comparison among the anti-CD20 agents was identified , emphasizing the need for head-to-head randomized controlled trials of these drugs to inform clinical decision-making for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.
