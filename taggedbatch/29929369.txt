 Precise isotopic and elemental characterization of spent nuclear fuel is a major concern for the validation of the neutronic calculation codes and waste management strategy in the nuclear industry. Generally , the elements of interest , particularly U and Pu which are the two major elements present in spent fuel , are purified by ion exchange or extractant resins before off-line measurements by thermal ionization mass spectrometry. The aim of the present work was to develop a new analytical approach based on capillary electrophoresis ( CE) hyphenated to a multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer ( MC-ICPMS) for online isotope ratio measurements. An electrophoretic separation protocol of U , Pu , and the fraction containing fission products and minor actinides ( Am and Cm) was developed using acetic acid as the electrolyte and complexing agent. The instrumentation for CE was designed to be used in a glovebox , and a laboratory-built interface was developed for hyphenation with MC-ICPMS. The separation was realized with only a few nL of a solution of spent nuclear fuel , and the reproducibilities obtained on the U and Pu isotope ratios were on the order of a few ‰ which is comparable to those obtained by thermal ionization mass spectrometry ( TIMS). This innovative protocol allowed a tremendous reduction of the analyte masses from μg to ng and also a drastic reduction of the liquid waste production from mL to μL. In addition , the time of analysis was shorted by at least a factor of three. All of these improved parameters are of major interest for nuclear applications.
