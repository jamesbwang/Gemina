 Uterine-serous-carcinoma ( USC) is a rare and aggressive variant of endometrial cancer. Whole-exome-sequencing ( WES) studies have recently reported c-Myc gene amplification in large number of USC suggesting c-Myc as a potential therapeutic target. We investigated the activity of novel BET bromodomain inhibitors ( GS-5829 and GS-626510 , Gilead-Science-Inc.) and JQ1 against primary USC-cultures and USC-xenografts. We evaluated c-Myc expression by qRT-PCR in a total of 45 USC including fresh-frozen-tumor-tissues and primary USC-cell-lines. We also performed immunohistochemistry ( IHC) and Western-Blot experiments in 8 USC tumors. USC cultures were evaluated for sensitivity to GS-5829 , GS-626510 and JQ1 Fresh-frozen USC and primary USC cell-lines overexpressed c-Myc when compared to normal tissues ( p = 0.0009 and = 0.0083 , respectively). High c-Myc expression was found in 7 of 8 of primary USC cell lines tested by qRT-PCR and 5 of 8 tested by IHC. GS-5829 and GS-626510 may represent novel , highly effective therapeutics agents against recurrent/chemotherapy resistant USC overexpressing c-Myc. Clinical studies with GS-5829 in USC-patients harboring chemotherapy-resistant disease are warranted.
