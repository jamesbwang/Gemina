 Doxorubicin ( DOX) is a chemotherapy agent widely used in clinical practice , and it is very efficient in tumor suppression , but the use of DOX is limited by a strong association with the development of severe<symptom> muscle atrophy and cardiotoxicity effects. Reversion or neutralization of the muscular atrophy can lead to a better prognosis. Recent studies have proposed that the negative effect of DOX on skeletal muscle is linked to its inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPk) , a key mediator of cellular metabolism. On the basis of this , our goal was to evaluate if aerobic exercise or metformin treatment , activators of AMPk , would be able to attenuate the deleterious effects on skeletal muscle induced by the DOX treatment. C57BL6 mice received either saline ( control) or DOX ( 2.5 mg/kg body<symptom> weight) intraperitoneally , twice a week. The animals on DOX were further divided into groups that received adjuvant treatment in the form of moderate aerobic physical exercise ( DOX+T) or metformin gavage ( 300 mg/body weight/day). Body<symptom> weight , metabolism , distance run , muscle fiber cross-sectional area ( CSA) , and protein synthesis and degradation were assessed. We demonstrated that aerobic training , but not metformin , associated with DOX increased the maximal aerobic capacity without changing muscle mass or fiber CSA , rescuing the muscle<symptom> fatigue<symptom> observed with DOX treatment alone. This improvement was associated with AMPk activation , thus surpassing the negative effects of DOX on muscle performance and bioenergetics. In conclusion , aerobic exercise increases AMPk activation and improved the skeletal muscle function , reducing the side effects of DOX.
