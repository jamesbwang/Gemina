 Multiple mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to the other-race effect on face memory , the phenomenon of better memory performance for own-race than other-race faces. Here , two of these mechanisms , increased attention allocation and greater holistic processing during memory encoding for own-race than other-race faces , were tested in two separate experiments. In these experiments event-related potentials were measured during study ( the difference due to memory , Dm) and test phase ( old/new effects) to examine brain activation related to memory encoding and retrieval , allowing for selective investigations of these memory sub-processes. In Experiment 1 , participants studied own-race ( Caucasian) and other-race ( Chinese) faces under focused or divided attention. In Experiment 2 , participants studied own-race ( Caucasian) and other-race ( African American) faces presented upright or upside down ( i.e. , inverted). Both experiments showed decreases in memory performance when attention allocation or holistic processing was reduced , but these effects were similar for own-race and other-race faces. Manipulations of holistic processing , but not attention allocation , influenced the neural other-race effects during memory encoding. Inverted own-race faces showed similar neural patterns as upright other-race faces , indicating that when holistic processing of own-race faces was reduced , these faces were encoded similarly as upright other-race faces. No influences of the experimental manipulations on other-race effects during memory retrieval were found. The present study provides the first neural evidence that increased holistic processing during memory encoding contributes to the other-race effect on face memory.
