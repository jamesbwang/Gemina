 The mechanisms underpinning the deposition of fine-grained , organic-rich sediments are still largely debated. Specifically , the impact of the interaction of clay particles with reactive , planktonic cyanobacterial cells to the sedimentary record is under studied. This interaction is a potentially major contributor to shale depositional models. Within a lab setting , the flocculation and sedimentation rates of these materials can be examined and measured in a controlled environment. Here , we detail a protocol for measuring the sedimentation rate of cyanobacterial/clay mixtures. This methodology is demonstrated through the description of two sample experiments: the first uses kaolin ( a dehydrated form of kaolinite) and Synechococcus sp.. PCC 7002 ( a marine coccoid cyanobacteria) , and the second uses kaolin and Synechocystis sp.. PCC 6803 ( a freshwater coccoid cyanobacteria). Cyanobacterial cultures are mixed with varying amounts of clay within a specially designed tank apparatus optimized to allow continuous , real-time video and photographic recording. The sampling procedures are detailed as well as a post-collection protocol for precise measurement of chlorophyll a from which the concentration of cyanobacterial cells remaining in suspension can be determined. Through experimental replication , a profile is constructed that displays sedimentation rate.
