 The study investigated the incidence of Achilles and patellar tendinopathy in adolescent elite athletes and non-athletic controls. Furthermore , predictive and associated factors for tendinopathy development were analyzed. The prospective study consisted of two measurement days ( M1/M2) with an interval of 3.2 ± 0.9 years. 157 athletes ( 12.1 ± 0.7 years) and 25 controls ( 13.3 ± 0.6 years) without Achilles/patellar tendinopathy were included at M1. Clinical and ultrasound examinations of both Achilles ( AT) and patellar tendons ( PT) were performed. Main outcome measures were incidence tendinopathy and structural intratendinous alterations ( hypo-/ hyperechogenicity , vascularization) at M2 ( %). Incidence of Achilles tendinopathy was 1 % in athletes and 0 % in controls. Patellar tendinopathy was more frequent in athletes ( 13 %) than in controls ( 4 %). Incidence of intratendinous alterations in ATs was 1-2 % in athletes and 0 % in controls , whereas in PTs it was 4-6 % in both groups ( p > 0.05). Intratendinous alterations at M2 were associated with patellar tendinopathy in athletes ( p ≤ 0.01). Intratendinous alterations at M1 , anthropometric data , training amount , sports or sex did not predict tendinopathy development ( p > 0.05). Incidence of tendinopathy and intratendinous alterations in adolescent athletes is low in ATs and more common in PTs. Development of intratendinous alterations in PT is associated with tendinopathy. However , predictive factors could not be identified.
