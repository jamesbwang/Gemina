 Using an age-structured process-based simulation model for diamondback moth ( DBM) , we model the population dynamics of this major Brassica pest using the cropping practices and climate of Guangdong , China. The model simulates two interacting sub-populations ( demes) , each representing a short season crop. The simulated DBM abundance , and hence pest problems , depend on planting regime , crop hygiene and biological control. A continuous supply of hosts , a low proportion of crop harvested and long residue times between harvest and replanting each exacerbate pest levels. Biological control provided by a larval parasitoid can reduce pest problems , but not eliminate them when climate is suitable for DBM and under certain planting practices. The classic Integrated Pest Management ( IPM) method of insecticide application , when pest threshold is reached , proved effective and halved the number of insecticide sprays when compared with the typical practice of weekly insecticide application.
