 In this review , most of the known and postulated mechanisms of osteopontin ( OPN) and its role in bone remodeling and orthodontic tooth movement are discussed based on available literature. OPN , a multifunctional protein , is considered crucial for bone remodeling , biomineralization , and periodontal remodeling during mechanical tension and stress ( orthodontic tooth movement). It contributes to bone remodeling by promoting osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity through CD44- and αvβ3-mediated cell signaling. Further , it has a definitive role in bone remodeling by the formation of podosomes , osteoclast survival , and osteoclast motility. OPN has been shown to have a regulatory effect on hydroxyapatite crystal ( HAP) growth and potently inhibits the mineralization of osteoblast cultures in a phosphate-dependent manner. Bone remodeling is vital for orthodontic tooth movement. Significant compressive and tensional forces on the periodontium induce the signaling pathways mediated by various osteogenic genes including OPN , bone sialoprotein , Osterix , and osteocalcin. The signaling pathways involved in the regulation of OPN and its effect on the periodontal tissues during orthodontic tooth movement are further discussed in this review. A limited number of studies have suggested the use of OPN as a biomarker to assess orthodontic treatment. Furthermore , the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) in OPN coding gene Spp1 with orthodontically induced root resorption remains largely unexplored. Accordingly , future research directions for OPN are outlined in this review.
