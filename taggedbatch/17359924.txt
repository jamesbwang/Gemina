 To determine the impact of Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) infection on brain structure and functional organization of severely affected adult patients with neurological complications that extend beyond Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome<disease><symptom> ( GBS)- like manifestations and include symptoms of the central nervous system ( CNS). In this first case-control neuroimaging study , we obtained structural and functional magnetic resonance images in nine rare adult patients in the subacute phase , and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. ZIKV patients showed atypical descending and rapidly progressing peripheral nervous system ( PNS) manifestations , and importantly , additional CNS presentations such as perceptual deficits. Voxel-based morphometry was utilized to evaluate gray matter volume , and resting state functional connectivity and Network Based Statistics were applied to assess the functional organization of the brain. Gray matter volume was decreased bilaterally in motor areas ( supplementary motor cortex , specifically Frontal Eye Fields) and beyond ( left inferior frontal sulcus). Additionally , gray matter volume increased in right middle frontal gyrus. Functional connectivity increased in a widespread network within and across temporal lobes. We provide preliminary evidence for a link between ZIKV neurological complications and changes in adult human brain structure and functional organization , comprising both motor-related regions potentially secondary to prolonged PNS weakness<symptom> , and nonsomatomotor regions indicative of PNS-independent alternations. The latter included the temporal lobes , particularly vulnerable in a range of neurological conditions. While future studies into the ZIKV-related neuroinflammatory mechanisms in adults are urgently needed , this study indicates that ZIKV infection can lead to an impact on the brain.
