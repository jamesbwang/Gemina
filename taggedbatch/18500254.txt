 Neutralizing antibodies ( Nabs) are a major challenge in clinical trials of adeno-associated virus ( AAV) vector gene therapy , because Nabs are able to inhibit AAV transduction in patients. We have successfully isolated several novel Nab-escaped AAV chimeric capsids in mice by administrating a mixture of AAV shuffled library and patient serum. These AAV chimeric capsid mutants enhanced Nab evasion from patient serum with a high muscle transduction efficacy. In this protocol , we describe the procedures for selection of the Nab-escaped AAV chimeric capsid , including isolation and characterization of Nab-escaping AAV mutants in mice muscle.
