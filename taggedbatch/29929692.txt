 With advances in osteosynthesis technology providing improved stability of fixation and better outcomes , surgical treatment has become the standard of care for distal femur fractures. Pre-contoured distal femoral locking plates are the most commonly used implants for fixation. However , healing problems such as delayed union , failure of fixation , and/ or nonunion are not uncommon. The fixation construct being `` too stiff '' is a commonly quoted reason when nonunion/failure of fixation occurs on distal femur fractures fixed with a plate. A flexible fixation construct allowing controlled axial micromotion could help stimulate the bone healing. In order to achieve this goal , plating construct stiffness can be modified by several methods.
