 Use of compression therapy to reduce the incidence of postthrombotic syndrome<disease><symptom> among patients with deep venous thrombosis is a controversial subject and there is no consensus on use of elastic versus inelastic compression , or on the levels and duration of compression. Inelastic devices with a higher static stiffness index , combine relatively small and comfortable pressure at rest with pressure while standing strong enough to restore the `` valve mechanism '' generated by plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of the foot. Since the static stiffness index is dependent on the rigidity of the compression system and the muscle strength within the bandaged area , improvement of muscle mass with muscle-strengthening programs and endurance training should be encouraged. Therefore , in the acute phase of deep venous thrombosis events , anticoagulation combined with inelastic compression therapy can reduce the extension of the thrombus. Notwithstanding , prospective studies evaluating the effectiveness of inelastic therapy in deep venous thrombosis and post-thrombotic syndrome<disease><symptom> are needed.
