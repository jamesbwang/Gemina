 Development of simple , sensitive and specific method for human<pathogen><disease> immunodeficiency<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) assays are urgently demand. In this study , we developed a novel molecularly imprinted polymer ( MIP) electrochemiluminescence ( MIP-ECL) sensor for the highly sensitive and selective HIV-1 gene detection using Europium sulfide nanocrystals ( EsNCs) as signal producing compound. Here , the HIV<pathogen> aptamer as the template and o-phenylenediamine as the functional monomer , were electropolymerized directly on the surface of ITO electrode. With the hybridization reaction between the assemblies of EuS NCs functionalized 5-amino-labeled oligonucleotides as capture probes and oligonucleotides as detection target ( HIV<pathogen> gene) , the ECL signal significantly increased using K
