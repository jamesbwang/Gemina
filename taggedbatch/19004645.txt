 Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are accumulative disorders that are most frequently found in agricultural farmers. The purpose of this study was to investigate factors that affect symptoms resulting from work-related musculoskeletal disorders among Cambodian farm workers working in fruit plantations in the eastern region of Thailand. The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire , Rapid Upper Limb Assessment , and Hazard Zone Jobs Checklist techniques were used to interview 861 farmers who participated in the study. The data showed that men who had been working for > 10 years were more at risk of neck<symptom> pain<symptom> than those working for < 1 year with adjusted odds ratio ( aOR) 1.66 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) ( 1.90 , 14.5). Among women those who had been working for > 10 years experienced lower back pain with aOR 8.13 , 95 % CI ( 1.04 , 63.74) , compared with those who had been working for < 1 year. Men whose tasks required raising the arms above shoulder height had a risk factor contributing to neck<symptom> pain<symptom> of aOR 1.68 , 95 % CI ( 1.08 , 2.61) when compared with those who did not work with this posture<symptom> , and women had aOR 1.82 , 95 % CI ( 1.07 , 3.12) when compared with those who did not work with this posture<symptom>. Based on the results of this study , it is recommended that work-related health conditions are monitored in migrant plantation workers to reduce the risks of musculoskeletal disorders.
