 The single-cell as the basic unit of biological organs and tissues has recently been considered an important window to furthermore understand molecular mechanisms of organ function and biology. The current issue with a special focus on single cell biomedicine is the first effort to collect the evidence of disease-associated single cell research , define the significance of single cell biomedicine in the pathogenesis of diseases , value the correlation of single cell gene sequencing with disease-specific biomarkers , and monitor the dynamics of RNA processes and responses to microenvironmental changes and drug resistances.
