 Cardiac imaging by means of myocardial Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography ( PET/CT) is being used increasingly to assess coronary artery disease , to guide revascularization decisions with more accuracy , and it allows robust quantitative analysis of both regional myocardial blood flow ( MBF) and myocardial flow reserve ( MFR). Recently , a more time-efficient protocol has been developed in combination with a residual activity correction algorithm in which a stress acquisition is performed directly after completion of the rest acquisition to subtract remaining myocardial radioactivity.The objective of this study is to define flow values of myocardial blood flow ( MBF) and Myocardial Flow Reserve ( MFR) with A mean MBF in rest of 1.02 ± 0.22 ml/g/min , a mean MBF in stress of 2.54 ± 0.41 ml/g/min with a mean MFR of 2.60 ± 0.61 were measured. Female patients had a significant higher MBF in rest and stress , but lower MFR; a small but significant negative correlation was measured between age and MBF in stress and MFR. Residual activity correction had a significant effect resulting in a difference in global stress MBF before and after correction of 0.39 ± 0.13 ml/g/min. This study established flow values for
