 Vitamin D status may be associated with insulin resistance and other key features of polycystic ovary syndrome<disease><symptom> ( PCOS) , but data from preliminary randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) are conflicting. Therefore , we aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on plasma glucose area under the curve ( AUCgluc , primary outcome measure) and on other metabolic and endocrine parameters ( secondary outcome measures). This study was a single-center , double-blind , randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted between December 2011 and July 2017 at the Medical University of Graz , Austria. One-hundred and eighty women with PCOS and 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D<pathogen>) concentrations < 75 nmol/L were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either receive 20,000 IU of cholecalciferol weekly or placebo over 24 weeks. Primary outcome was the between-group difference in AUCgluc at study end while adjusting for baseline values. In total , 123 participants completed the study ( age 25.9 ± 4.7 years; BMI 27.5 ± 7.3 kg/m Vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on metabolic and endocrine parameters in PCOS with the exception of a reduced plasma glucose during OGTT.
