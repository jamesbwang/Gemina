 Interleukin-33 ( IL-33) is a member of the interleukin-1 ( IL-1) cytokine family and an extracellular ligand for the orphan IL-1 receptor ST2. Accumulated evidence shows that the IL-33/ ST2 axis plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of central nervous system ( CNS) diseases and injury , including traumatic brain injury ( TBI). However , the roles and molecular mechanisms of the IL-33/ ST2 axis after TBI remain poorly understood. In this study , we investigated the role of IL-33/ ST2 signaling in mouse TBI-induced brain edema<symptom> and neurobehavioral deficits , and further exploited underlying mechanisms , using salubrinal ( SAL) , the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress inhibitor and anti-ST2L. The increase in IL-33 level and the decrease in ST2L level at injured cortex were first observed at 24 h post-TBI. By immunofluorescent double-labeled staining , IL-33 co-localized in GFAP-positive astrocytes , and Olig-2-positive oligodendrocytes , and predominantly presented in their nucleus. Additionally , TBI-induced brain water content , motor function outcome , and spatial learning and memory deficits were alleviated by IL-33 treatment. Moreover , IL-33 and SAL alone , or their combination prevented TBI-induced the increase of IL-1β and TNF-α levels , suppressed the up-regulation of ER stress , apoptosis and autophagy after TBI. However , anti-ST2L treatment could significantly invert the above effects of IL-33. Together , these data demonstrate that IL-33/ ST2 signaling mitigates TBI-induced brain edema<symptom> , motor function outcome , spatial learning and memory deficits , at least in part , by a mechanism involving suppressing autophagy , ER stress , apoptosis and neuroinflammation.
