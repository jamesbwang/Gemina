 Multiple myeloma is a malignant hemato-oncological malignancy that affects up to 600 people in the Czech Republic every year. Treatment options are under constant improvement and the autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation ( Tx) remains a part of treatment protocols. Despite modern drug administration , the autologous Tx keeps its irreplaceable position and when ensuring two autologous Tx , the studies confirm a survival time that is more than twice as long as in nontransplant patients. However , there are no standardized procedures specifying the period in between the transplantations in more details. Within our group , we compared the total of 66 patients who were administered a double transplant. One group underwent both planned tandem autologous Tx within a median of six months while mostly reaching just a partial remission ( PR) and less after the first transplant and out of disease progression. The other group of patients only underwent the second Tx within a median of up to 14 months during a progression period or disease relapse. Both groups were comparable as far as basic parameters are concerned ( age , type of induction therapy , cytogenetic risk). A significantly better TFS ( treatment free survival) and overall survival ( OS) were observed in the group where a tandem Tx was administered. TFS was 18 months and median OS was not reached for the group of patients who received tandem Tx while TFS was 10 months ( p = 0.04) and median OS was 57 months ( p = 0.005) for those who received delayed second Tx. In the group of patients who received second Tx during relapse , we observed that TFS and OS were shorter in those with a higher paraprotein level , suggesting the potential role of paraprotein level as a prognostic marker. The TFS in the subgroup with a high initial level was 4 months vs. 11 months ( p = 0.0016) and OS 44 months vs. 65 months ( p = 0.03).
