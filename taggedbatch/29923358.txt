 This study was aimed to investigate the effects of rumen-protected γ-aminobutyric acid ( RP-GABA) on apparent nutrient digestibility , growth performance and health status in heat stressed beef cattle. Fifty Jinjiang Yellow cattle were randomly assigned to 5 treatments ( 10 animals/treatment). Treatments 1 to 5 were basal diets affixed with 0 ( control) , 8 , 16 , 24 and 32 mg of RP-GABA/kg of body<symptom> weight ( BW) respectively. The trial lasted 45 days. Apparent digestibility of crude protein ( CP) , crude fiber ( CF) and calcium ( Ca) quadratically increased with increasing RP-GABA ( p < .01) , while apparent digestibility of phosphorus ( P) tended to quadratically increase ( p = .09). Dietary supplementation with increasing RP-GABA linearly increased DM digestibility and average daily gain ( ADG) ( p < .01) , whereas the feed<symptom> to gain ( F: G) ratio linearly decreased with increasing RP-GABA ( p < .01). The average daily feed intake ( ADFI) value tended to linearly increase with RP-GABA supplementation ( p = .08). Total protein ( TP) , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN) and malondialdehyde ( MDA) levels quadratically decreased ( p < .01) with increasing RP-GABA , however albumin ( ALB) , glucose ( GLU) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , triiodothyronine ( T3) and thyroxine ( T4) levels quadratically increased ( p ≤ .01). In conclusion , the present results indicated that dietary supplementation with RP-GABA led to improved nutrient digestibility , growth performance and antioxidant status in heat stressed beef cattle.
