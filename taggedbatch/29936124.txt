 Traditionally , Phase I oncology trials evaluate the safety profile of a novel agent and identify a maximum tolerable dose based on toxicity alone. With the development of biologically targeted agents , investigators believe the efficacy of a novel agent may plateau or diminish before reaching the maximum tolerable dose while toxicity continues to increase. This motivates dose-finding based on the simultaneous evaluation of toxicity and efficacy. Previously , we investigated hierarchical modeling in the context of Phase I dose-escalation studies for multiple populations and found borrowing strength across populations improved operating characteristics. In this article , we discuss three hierarchical extensions to commonly used probability models for efficacy and toxicity in Phase I-II trials and adapt our previously proposed dose-finding algorithm for multiple populations to this setting. First , we consider both parametric and non-parametric bivariate models for binary outcomes and , in addition , we consider an under-parameterized model that combines toxicity and efficacy into a single trinary outcome. Our simulation results indicate hierarchical modeling increases the probability of correctly identifying the optimal dose and increases the average number of patients treated at the optimal dose , with the under-parameterized hierarchical model displaying desirable and robust operating characteristics.
