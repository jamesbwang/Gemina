 This unit describes a protocol for generation of lung organoids. A lung organoid is a 3D cell/hydrogel composite that resembles the morphology and cellular composition of the human distal lung. These tissue-engineered constructs provide an in vitro model of human lung and are best suited for disease modeling applications. The organoid generation methodology is flexible , allowing for easy scalability in the number of organoids produced and in the ability to accommodate a wide range of cell types.
