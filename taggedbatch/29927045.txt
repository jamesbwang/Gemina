 To investigate the effects of curcumin ( CUR) and melatonin ( MEL) on new bone formation following rapid maxillary expansion ( RME) in rats. For this study , 24 12-week-old adult male Wistar albino rats from the Animal Laboratory at Adnan Menderes University , Faculty of Medicine , were used. The rats were randomly divided into the following 3 groups ( n = 8 each): only expansion ( OE) , expansion plus MEL ( MEL) and expansion plus CUR ( CUR). CUR and MEL were given to the rats during the study period. After the sacrifice of the animals , biochemical , histological and immunohistochemical examinations were performed. Serum bone alkaline phosphatase levels in the MEL group were statistically ( P = .007) higher than in the OE group. Serum glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities in the CUR and MEL groups were significantly higher than in the OE group ( P = .007 and P = .021 , respectively). Inflammatory cell infiltration , new bone formation and capillary intensity parameters did not demonstrate statistically significant differences between the groups ( P = .865 , P = .067 and P = .055 , respectively). The immunohistochemical findings revealed that IL-1 , IL-6 and TNF-α H scores showed considerable differences between the groups ( all P < .001). The highest IL-1 , IL-6 and TNF-α H scores were found in the OE groups rather than in the other groups ( P < .001). CUR and MEL treatments may be effective in accelerating new bone formation and beneficial in preventing relapse following the RME procedures.
