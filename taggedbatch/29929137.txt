 The existing form of an ionizable organic compound can simultaneously affect its soil adsorption and plant bioactivity. In this experiment , the adsorption and bioactivity of two weak acid herbicides ( WAHs) , imazethapyr and 2,4-D , were studied to explore the predominant mechanism by which the soil pH and the addition of biochar can influence the phytotoxicity of WAHs in soil. Then , the WAH concentration extracted by hollow fiber-based liquid-phase microextraction ( C
