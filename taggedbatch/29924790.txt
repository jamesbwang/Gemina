 Described in the article is a clinical case report regarding successful surgical treatment of total thrombosis of a stent graft in a high-risk surgical patient , having previously undergone endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> by means of a unilateral stent graft with suprarenal fixation of its crown and femorofemoral crossover bypass grafting. 5 months after the operation , the patient began complaining of rest pain in his right leg and trophic ulcers<disease><symptom> of the foot. The findings of MSCT angiography revealed total thrombosis of the stent graft , to be later on followed by operative intervention , i. e. resection of an infrarenal abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> with the removal of the stent graft , aortofemoral bifurcation prosthetic repair and graft-renal prosthetic repair on the left. The postoperative period was complicated by a transitory ischaemic attack. On POD 29 , the patient was discharged in a satisfactory condition. 8 months later , the findings of the control MSCT angiography revealed thrombosis of the graft of the left renal artery , with the left kidney secondarily shrunken. However , the clinical biochemistry data showed no evidence of renal<symptom> failure<symptom> , thus suggesting that renal function was compensated exclusively at the expense of the right kidney.
