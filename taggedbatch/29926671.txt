 To investigate the effect of taurine magnesium coordination compound ( TMCC) on torsades de pointes ( TdP) in isolated guinea pig hearts. Healthy male guinea pigs weighting 250 ~ 300 g were randomly divided into 4 groups: â‘  TdP model group ( Incidence of TdP in TdP model group was 6/7. TdP incidence could be decreased significantly by 1 , 2 , 4 mmol/L TMCC , and was 5/6 , 1/6 , 0/6 respectively. Compared with the pre-drug , Chromanol 293B under hypokalemic solution in TdP model group increased TDR ( corrected) evidently ( TMCC can play the role against TdP through decreasing TDR and instability of QT interval , and inhibiting early after depolarization ( EAD).
