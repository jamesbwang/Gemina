 Although the FDA already has approved two types of drug therapies for Alzheimer 's disease , in regard to moderate AD , there is no clear research to support the best choice of drug treatment. The goal of this study was to examine the levels of serum biomarkers in moderate-AD patients and to explore the value of these serum biomarkers for the diagnosis of memantine sensitivity in AD patients who are significantly affected by MEM. In our study , 177 patients with moderate AD were enrolled and divided into memantine-sensitive AD ( n = 90) and memantine-insensitive AD ( n = 87) groups. The sera from all patients were collected , and seven serum biomarkers were analysed. Then , 120 patients were used to establish a diagnostic model that was built with a binary logistic regression analysis , and 57 patients were used to validate our model. In addition , the area under the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve was established. From the seven serum biomarkers , the four serum biomarkers that were selected in to establish the regression model were VEGF , BDNF , IL-6 and IL-1β. The ROC curve of best combined detection was 0.899. The diagnostic ratio of the logistic model was 0.825. This study suggests that the logistic regression model ( LRM) and the ROC curve based on patients ' serum levels of VEGF , BDNF , IL-6 and IL-1β is a promising research for diagnosing and choosing the best course of treatment for moderate AD.
