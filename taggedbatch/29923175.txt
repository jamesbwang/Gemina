 The transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase ( KIT) , encoded by KIT , and the KIT ligand , encoded by KITLG , play crucial roles in the control of physiological and pathological skin pigmentation. The binding of KITLG to KIT regulates the migration , proliferation , differentiation and survival of melanocytes , and regulates melanogenesis and melanosome transfer.
