 Type 2 diabetes ( T2D) is associated with numerous comorbidities that significantly reduce quality of life , increase mortality and complicate treatment decisions. In a recent cardiovascular outcomes trial , Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients ( EMPA-REG OUTCOME) , the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 ( SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin was shown to reduce cardiovascular ( CV) mortality and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> in high-risk patients with T2D with a previous CV event or with established CV disease ( CVD). Recently published data from the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study ( CANVAS-PROGRAM) study suggested that the cardiovascular benefits of empagliflozin are also seen with the SGLT2-inhibitor canagliflozin , indicating a class effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. Evidence for a class effect has also been shown by meta-analyses and real-world studies , including the Comparative Effectiveness of Cardiovascular Outcomes in New Users of SGLT-2 Inhibitors ( CVD-REAL) and The Health Improvement Network ( THIN) databases. These findings also suggest the results of EMPA-REG OUTCOME can be applied to patients with T2D with a broader CV risk profile , including people at low risk of CVD.
