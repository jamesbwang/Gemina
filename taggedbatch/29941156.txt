 Despite limited efficacy and significant safety concerns , antipsychotic medications are frequently used to treat behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia ( BPSD) in long-term residential care. This study evaluates the sustained reduction of antipsychotic use for BPSD through a deprescribing intervention and education of health care professionals. Repeated-measures , longitudinal , single-arm study. Long-term residential care of older adults. Nursing staff from 23 nursing homes recruited 139 residents taking regular antipsychotic medication for â‰¥ 3 months , without primary psychotic illness , such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder , or severe BPSD. An antipsychotic deprescribing protocol was established. Education of general practitioners , pharmacists , and residential care nurses focused on nonpharmacological prevention and management of BPSD. The primary outcome was antipsychotic use over 12-month follow-up; secondary outcomes were BPSD ( Neuropsychiatric Inventory , Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory , and social withdrawal) and adverse outcomes ( falls , hospitalizations , and cognitive decline). The number of older adults on regular antipsychotics over 12 months reduced by 81.7 % ( 95 % confidence interval: 72.4-89.0). Withdrawal was not accompanied by drug substitution or a significant increase in pro-re-nata antipsychotic or benzodiazepine administration. There was no change in BPSD or in adverse outcomes. In a selected sample of older adults living in long-term residential care , sustained reduction in regular antipsychotic use is feasible without an increase of BPSD.
