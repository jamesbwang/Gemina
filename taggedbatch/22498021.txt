 In the context of colorectal cancer screening , we aimed to compare the effectiveness of different emotion-laden narratives , to investigate the specific emotions elicited at both subjective and physiological levels , and to test the effects of emotions explicitly expressed by the narrative character. Study 1 used a between-participants design comparing four conditions: relief-based narrative , regret-based narrative , control ( test-uptake only) narrative , and standard invitation material ( no-narrative condition). Study 2 used a mixed design , with the narrative content as a within-participants factor and whether emotions were expressed by the narrative character or not as between-participants factor. The main outcome measures were: intention to undergo testing ( Studies 1 and 2) , knowledge , risk perception , proportion of informed choices ( Study 1) , subjective emotional responses , changes in skin conductance , heart rate , and corrugator muscle activity ( Study 2). In Study 1 , relative to the non-narrative condition ( 51 %) , only the relief-based narrative significantly increased intention to undergo testing ( 86 %). Relative to the standard invitation material , the narrative conditions did not decrease knowledge , alter risk perception , or decrease the proportion of informed choices. In Study 2 , the relief-based narrative elicited the lowest self-reported negative affect , and received greater implicit attention , as suggested by the larger heart rate decrease. Making the emotions experienced by the narrative character explicit decreased negative affect , as indicated by the lower skin conductance and corrugator responses during reading. Our findings provide support for the use of a relief-based narrative with emotions expressed by the character in addition to the standard information material to promote colorectal cancer screening.
