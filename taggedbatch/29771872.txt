 Outbreaks associated with untreated recreational water can be caused by pathogens , toxins , or chemicals in fresh water ( e.g. , lakes , rivers) or marine water ( e.g. , ocean). During 2000-2014 , public health officials from 35 states and Guam voluntarily reported 140 untreated recreational water-associated outbreaks to CDC. These outbreaks resulted in at least 4,958 cases of disease and two deaths. Among the 95 outbreaks with a confirmed infectious etiology , enteric pathogens caused 80 ( 84 %); 21 ( 22 %) were caused by norovirus<pathogen> , 19 ( 20 %) by Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , 14 ( 15 %) by Shigella<pathogen> , and 12 ( 13 %) by Cryptosporidium. Investigations of these 95 outbreaks identified 3,125 cases; 2,704 ( 87 %) were caused by enteric pathogens , including 1,459 ( 47 %) by norovirus<pathogen> , 362 ( 12 %) by Shigella<pathogen> , 314 ( 10 %) by Cryptosporidium , and 155 ( 5 %) by E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. Avian schistosomes were identified as the cause in 345 ( 11 %) of the 3,125 cases. The two deaths were in persons affected by a single outbreak ( two cases) caused by Naegleria fowleri. Public parks ( 50 ( 36 %)) and beaches ( 45 ( 32 %)) were the leading settings associated with the 140 outbreaks. Overall , the majority of outbreaks started during June-August ( 113 ( 81 %)); 65 ( 58 %) started in July. Swimmers and parents of young swimmers can take steps to minimize the risk for exposure to pathogens , toxins , and chemicals in untreated recreational water by heeding posted advisories closing the beach to swimming; not swimming in discolored , smelly , foamy , or scummy water; not swimming while sick with diarrhea<disease><symptom>; and limiting water entering the nose when swimming in warm freshwater.
