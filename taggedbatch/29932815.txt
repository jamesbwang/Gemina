 Considering the need for new technologies for the removal of pesticides from the aqueous environment , the Moringa oleifera seed husks ( h-MO) were investigated for the diuron adsorption from contaminated water at different temperatures and solute concentrations. The biosorbent used in this study was characterized by chemical , structural and textural analyses. The best experimental condition for the biosorption was determined by evaluating the mass of the biosorbent and the pH solution. We found a good adsorption capacity for the herbicide where the maximum adsorption capacity was 14.74 mg/g at pH 5 and 45 °C. In addition , the adsorption process of diuron by the h-MO occurred spontaneously , in which , ΔG ° values increased as the temperature increased , meaning that the process tends to a more energetically favourable process at higher temperatures. Both Langmuir and Sips isotherm models presented satisfactory adjustment at all temperatures and the pseudo-second-order model presented the best fit for the experimental results. The application of the intra-particle diffusion model showed that the adsorption process started instantaneously through the boundary layer of the adsorbent and that the pore diffusion step was a limiting step in the process. Finally , the capacity of the h-MO was compared with other adsorbents that had been used for diuron removal from contaminated where it was found that the adsorption capacity of the h-MO is much higher than other natural adsorbents.
