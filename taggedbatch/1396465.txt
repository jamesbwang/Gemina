 Deterioration in the groundwater quality is prevalent in many parts of the eastern and north-eastern India; however , little attention has been paid for its assessment. In order to evaluate the groundwater suitability in the north-eastern region of India , this study was carried out in Barpeta District of Assam. The groundwater samples were collected from various locations to represent the overall water quality of the district. Suitability was assessed in terms of its usability for drinking and irrigation. It was found that the groundwater samples are contaminated with high amount of arsenic , which refers that water is unfit for consumption as well as agricultural activities. Hydrogeological studies revealed that regional geological factors might be responsible for excess arsenic concentration in the region. Overall , groundwater quality was found to be alkaline having moderate hardness with high amount of iron , manganese , and lead as well.
