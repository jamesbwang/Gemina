 <br> Background: Neuronal intermediates that communicate estrogen and progesterone feedback to gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH) neurons are essential for modulating reproductive cyclicity. Individually , kisspeptin and nitric oxide ( NO) influence GnRH secretion. However , it is possible these two neuronal intermediates interact with one another to affect reproductive cyclicity. We investigated the neuroanatomical relationship of one isoform of the enzyme that synthesizes NO , neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS) , to kisspeptin and GnRH in adult female rhesus monkeys and sheep using dual-label immunofluorescence. Additionally , we evaluated if the phase of the reproductive cycle would affect these relationships. Overall , no effect of stage of cycle was observed for any variable in this study. In the arcuate nucleus ( ARC) of sheep , 98.8 ± 3.5 % of kisspeptin neurons colocalized with nNOS , and kisspeptin close-contacts were observed onto nNOS neurons. In contrast to ewes , no colocalization was observed between kisspeptin and nNOS in the infundibular arcuate nucleus ( INF ARC) of primates , but kisspeptin fibers were apposed to nNOS neurons. In the preoptic area ( POA) of ewes , 15.0 ± 4.2 % of GnRH neurons colocalized with nNOS. In primates , 38.8 ± 10.1 % of GnRH neurons in the mediobasal hypothalamus ( MBH) colocalized with nNOS , and GnRH close-contacts were observed onto nNOS neurons in both sheep and primates. Although species differences were observed , this work establishes a neuroanatomical framework between nNOS and kisspeptin and nNOS and GnRH in adult female nonhuman primates and sheep. <br>.
