 Mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI) has been linked to enduring neurological damage following repetitive injury. Previously , we reported that intensity-specific , repetitive mTBI exacerbated microvascular and axonal damage in brainstem. For a more rigorous and global assessment , we assessed the burden of neocortical diffuse axonal injury ( DAI) evoked by repetitive mTBI. Mice were subjected to mild central fluid percussion injuries at 1.4 and 1.6 atm with or without repetitive insult at a 3-hour interval and killed at 24 hours postinjury. Neocortical DAI within layer V was quantitatively assessed by double-labeling p-c-Jun and NeuN to identify both the axotomized and total neuronal population. Both confocal and electron microscopic findings revealed no apparent evidence of neuronal death. Repetitive mTBI of 1.6 atm group , but not of 1.4 atm group , demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of axotomized neurons. These results demonstrate that different intensities of mTBI induced different burdens of DAI after repetitive insult. Interestingly , the parallel loss of the righting reflex reflected differences in injury intensity , yet the duration of this reflex was not elongated by the repetitive insult. These data highlight some of the complex issues surrounding repetitive mTBI and its associated morbidity , mandating the need for continued exploration.
