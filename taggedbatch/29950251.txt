 To examine whether the D-galactose induced aging model is an appropriate model for further aging research. Experimental study. Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine , Istanbul University , Turkey , June 2015- June 2017. The study comprises 3 groups of rats. Group I is young control ( YC) 5-month-old rats. Group II is 5-month- old rats , which were mimetically aged ( MA) for 6 weeks via intraperitoneal D-galactose ( 60 mg/kg body weight/day , 0.5 mL) administration. Group III is naturally aged ( NA) 24-month-old rats. Group I and III received intraperitoneal saline ( 0.9 % 0.5 mL) for 6 weeks as vehicle. Group I and Group II received injections at 21 weeks age and Group III rats 6 weeks before 24 months age. Tissues were harvested when rats became 6.5-month-old ( Group I and Group II) and 24-month-old ( Group III). Quantitative biochemical analyses of proteins , lipids , DNA biomarkers and Cu , Zn-SOD were conducted. Statistical analysis of the data was conducted using ANOVA , followed by post-hoc Bonferroni test. Higher magnitude of oxidative damage and diminished antioxidant defence capacity were found in both mimetically aged and naturally aged testicular tissues. It is observed that D-galactose aging model group shares significant similarities in terms of impaired redox homeostasis with the naturally aged rats. D-galactose induced testicular aging model successfully mimics aging process. Therefore , D-galactose induced aging model may be used as an accelerated aging model to study the age related alterations and interventions.
