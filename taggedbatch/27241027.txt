 A low-molecular-weight gel ( LMWG) with a hydrazone moiety and an aggregate-induced emission ( AIE) unit was fabricated; the self-assembly and disassembly of the LMWG under different stimuli conditions were studied. The LMWG exhibited multiple stimuli sensitivity with temperature , light , ions , and ionic strength. The hydrazone was integrated into the gelator to act as ion sensing sites and hydrogen bond donor groups to fulfil the task of ion recognition of Ni
