 The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias<symptom> ( SCAs) consist of a highly heterogeneous group of rare movement disorders characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia<symptom> variably associated with ophthalmoplegia<symptom> , pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs , dementia , pigmentary retinopathy , seizures<symptom> , lower motor neuron signs , or peripheral neuropathy. Over 41 different SCA subtypes have been described evidencing the high clinical and genetic heterogeneity. We previously reported a novel spinocerebellar ataxia<symptom> type subtype , SCA37 , linked to an 11-Mb genomic region on 1p32 , in a large Spanish ataxia<symptom> pedigree characterized by ataxia<symptom> and a pure cerebellar syndrome<disease><symptom> distinctively presenting with early-altered vertical eye movements<symptom>. Here we demonstrate the segregation of an unstable intronic ATTTC pentanucleotide repeat mutation within the 1p32 5 ' non-coding regulatory region of the gene encoding the reelin adaptor protein DAB1 , implicated in neuronal migration , as the causative genetic defect of the disease in four Spanish SCA37 families. We describe the clinical-genetic correlation and the first SCA37 neuropathological findings caused by dysregulation of cerebellar DAB1 expression. Post-mortem neuropathology of two patients with SCA37 revealed severe<symptom> loss<symptom> of Purkinje cells with abundant astrogliosis , empty baskets , occasional axonal spheroids , and hypertrophic fibres by phosphorylated neurofilament immunostaining in the cerebellar cortex. The remaining cerebellar Purkinje neurons showed loss of calbindin immunoreactivity , aberrant dendrite arborization , nuclear pathology including lobulation , irregularity , and hyperchromatism , and multiple ubiquitinated perisomatic granules immunostained for DAB1. A subpopulation of Purkinje cells was found ectopically mispositioned within the cerebellar cortex. No significant neuropathological alterations were identified in other brain regions in agreement with a pure cerebellar syndrome<disease><symptom>. Importantly , we found that the ATTTC repeat mutation dysregulated DAB1 expression and induced an RNA switch resulting in the upregulation of reelin-DAB1 and PI3K/AKT signalling in the SCA37 cerebellum. This study reveals the unstable ATTTC repeat mutation within the DAB1 gene as the underlying genetic cause and provides evidence of reelin-DAB1 signalling dysregulation in the spinocerebellar ataxia<symptom> type 37.
