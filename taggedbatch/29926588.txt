 To investigate the effects of yellow wine polyphenols on the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in diabetic cardiomyopathy rats. Thirty SD rats were randomly divided into control group ( Control) , diabetic cardiomyopathy group ( DCM) and diabetic cardiomyopathy treated with yellow wine polyphenols group ( DCM+YWP). A single intraperitoneal injection of 65 mg/kg streptozotocin ( STZ) was utilized to establish a rat model of DCM. The rats in control group were treated with citrate buffer at the same dose of a single intraperitoneal injection. DCM+YWP group were treated with 18 mg/kg Yellow wine polyphenols by ig after modeling. After treated for 12 weeks , the general condition of rats were observed. The cardiac structure and function of the rats were observed by Doppler echocardiography. The ultrastructure of myocardium were observed using electron microscopy. The inflammation<symptom> index of myocardial tissue was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). The oxidative stress in myocardial tissues was assessed by oxidative stress detection kits. The expressions of Bax , Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 ( cleaved) in myocardial were detected by Western blot. Compared with DCM group , the blood glucose levels and body<symptom> weight of rats in the DCM+YWP group were not changed significantly. Echocardiography showed that left ventricular end-diastolic diameter , left ventricular end-systolic diameter were decreased ( Yellow wine polyphenols can improve the diabetic cardiomyopathy rat cardiac function , attenuates inflammation<symptom> and oxidative stress in diabetic rats , inhibit the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in diabetic cardiomyopathy.
