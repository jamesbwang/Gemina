 Cyanide , as an ambidentate ligand , plays a pivotal role in providing a simple diatomic building-block motif for controlled metal aggregation ( M-CN-M '). Specifically , the inherent hard-soft nature of the cyanide ligand , i.e. , hard-nitrogen and soft-carbon centers , is due to electronic handles for binding Lewis acids following the hard-soft acid-base principle. Studies by Holm and Karlin showed structural and electronic requirements for cyanide-bridged ( por) FeIII-CN-CuII/I ( por = porphyrin) molecular assemblies as biomimetics for cyanide-inhibited terminal quinol oxidases and cytochrome-C oxidase. The dinitrosyliron unit ( DNIU) that exists in two redox states , ( Fe ( NO) 2) 9 and ( Fe ( NO) 2) 10 , draws attention as an electronic analogy of CuII and CuI , d9 and d10 , respectively. In similar controlled aggregations , L-type ( ( η5-C5R5) Fe ( dppe) ( CN)) ( dppe = diphenyl phosphinoethane; R = H and Me) have been used as N-donor , μ-cyanoiron metalloligands to stabilize the DNIU in two redox states. Two bimetallic ( ( η5-C5R5) ( dppe) FeII-CN- ( Fe ( NO) 2) 9 ( sIMes)) ( BF4) complexes , Fe-1 ( R = H) and Fe * -1 ( R = CH3) , showed dissimilar FeIIC ( triple bond , length as m-dash) N- ( Fe ( NO) 2) 9 angular bends due to the electronic donor properties of the ( ( η5-C5R5) Fe ( dppe) ( CN)) μ-cyanoiron metalloligand. A trimetallic ( ( η5-C5Me5) ( dppe) FeII-CN) 2- ( Fe ( NO) 2) 10 complex , Fe * -2 , engaged two bridging μ-cyanoiron metalloligands to stabilize the ( Fe ( NO) 2) 10 unit. The lability of the FeII-CN- ( Fe ( NO) 2) 9/10 bond was probed by suitable X-type ( Na + SPh-) and L-type ( PMe3) ligands. Treatment of Fe-1 and Fe * -1 with PMe3 accounted for a reduction-induced substitution at the DNIU , releasing ( ( η5-C5R5) Fe ( dppe) ( CN)) and N-heterocyclic carbene , and generating ( PMe3) 2Fe ( NO) 2 as the reduced ( Fe ( NO) 2) 10 product.
