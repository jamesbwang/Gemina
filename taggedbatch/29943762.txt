 Amyloidosis due to deposits of transthyretin ( ATTR) is currently considered the most frequent form of cardiac amyloidosis and its incidence is increasing thanks to the advances in diagnostic imaging techniques. Some non-invasive diagnostic criteria have recently been published on this entity that due to the development of new drugs for the specific treatment of cardiac ATTR , have prognostic and therapeutic implications. That is why cardiac ATTR could cease to be a rare disease and become a frequent one , and become potentially treatable instead of incurable. We present the case of an 80-year-old male diagnosed with non-hereditary cardiac ATTR by means of gammagraphy with 99mTc diphosfonate scintigraphy ( 99mTc-DPD) following the new criteria of non-invasive diagnosis.
