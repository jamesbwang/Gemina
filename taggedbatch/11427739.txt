 Notch signaling is mainly regulated by Notch1 during development of chicken germ stem cells; however , the molecular mechanisms that contribute to generation of these germ stem cells have not been thoroughly investigated. In our studies , Overexpression of the Notch1 NICD promoted development of the reproductive ridge , but inhibited the formation of seminiferous tubules. The formation efficiency of PGCs in the reproductive ridge following overexpression of NICD ( 7.5 % ± 0.11) was significantly higher than that ( 4.9 % ± 0.17 , In summary , Notch signaling plays diametrically opposing roles during normal development of chicken PGCs and SSCs , and these functions was determined by the expression of NICD , changes in the CBF-1/ RBP complex composition , and histone modification.
