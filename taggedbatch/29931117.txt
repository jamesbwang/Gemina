 Foliar application of zinc ( Zn) to crops is an effective way to increase the grain concentration of Zn. However , the development of more efficient foliar Zn fertilisers is limited by a lack of knowledge regarding the distribution , mobility and speciation of Zn in leaves once it is taken up by the plant. We performed an experiment using radiolabelled Zn ( 65Zn) , and in situ time resolved elemental imaging using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy ( XFM) , to investigate the behaviour of two commonly used Zn foliar fertilisers ( Zn sulfate and ZnEDTA) in wheat ( Triticum aestivum) leaves. Both experiments showed that Zn had limited mobility in leaves , moving < 25 mm from the application point after 24 h. Although limited , the translocation of Zn occurred quickly for both treatments; moving more between 3 and 12 h after application than between 12 and 24 h. Speciation analysis using synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure ( XANES) showed that ZnEDTA was in fact taken up in chelated form and not as ionic Zn ( Zn2 +). The XANES data also showed that Zn , from both treatments , was then complexed by ligands in the leaf ( e.g. phytate and citrate) , potentially in response to localised Zn toxicity. The results of the present study provide important insights into the behaviour of commonly used foliar applied Zn fertilisers , and can be used to optimise current fertilisation strategies and contribute to the development of more efficient foliar Zn fertilisers.
