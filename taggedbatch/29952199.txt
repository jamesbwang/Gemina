 Multifunctional therapeutic agents in the second near-infrared ( NIR-II) window have attracted wide attention on account of their synergetic properties for effective cancer therapy. Here , we construct a selective growth strategy for the first time to fabricate ternary Janus nanoparticles ( JNPs) containing hemispherical MnO
