 Studies have reported a high prevalence of peri-implantitis. The etiology of peri-implantitis remains unclear and no available treatments result in total resolution of established peri-implantitis. To investigate the factors that interfere with osteoblast adhesion to contaminated titanium surfaces after different surface treatments. Grade 4 titanium discs were randomly divided into 5 groups and each group was divided into 2 subgroups , with one contaminated with Aggregatibacter<pathogen> actinomycetemcomitans<pathogen> ( A.<pathogen> actinomycetemcomitans<pathogen>) , and the other contaminated with Porphyromonas<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> ( P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen>). Group 1 did not receive bacterial inoculation or surface debridement and served as a control. Group 2 received A.<pathogen> actinomycetemcomitans<pathogen> or P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> inoculation , separately. Group 3 received bacterial inoculation and titanium curette debridement , followed by normal saline irrigation. Group 4 received bacterial inoculation , curette debridement , normal saline irrigation , and ultrasonication. Group 5 received bacterial inoculation , curette debridement , normal saline irrigation , and placement in 0.12 % chlorhexidine. After various surface treatments , the surface roughness and hydrophilicity of the titanium surface were measured , the number of adhered osteoblast cells was calculated , and the amount of residual lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) was quantified. A.<pathogen> actinomycetemcomitans<pathogen> and P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> biofilms noticeably reduced surface hydrophilicity. Groups 3-5 showed decreased hydrophilicity and fewer adhered osteoblast cells compared with the control group. Although ultrasonication was more effective in removing LPS than curette debridement and chlorhexidine , cell adhesion was not as high as with clean titanium discs. The non-surgical treatment used in this study was not effective in removing LPS from titanium surfaces and increasing osteoblast adhesion. A more effective method to remove LPS completely is required to enhance the treatment outcome of peri-implantitis.
