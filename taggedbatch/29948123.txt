 γ-Aminobutyric acid ( GABA) affected ABA and ethylene metabolic genes and signal components in salt-treated poplar , indicating its potential role in signal pathways of ABA and ethylene during salt stress. GABA is a small signalling molecule that accumulates rapidly in plants exposed to various stresses. However , the relationship between GABA and other signalling molecules , such as hormones , remains unclear. Here , in the poplar woody plant under 200-mM NaCl conditions , the application of low ( 0.25 mM) and high ( 10 mM) exogenous GABA , compared to 0 mM , affected the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and hormones , including ABA and ethylene , in different manners. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that 1025 differentially expressed genes ( DEGs; | log2Ratio | ≥ 1.5) were widely affected by exogenous GABA under salt stress. A clustering analysis revealed that GABA could rescue or promote the effects of salt stress on gene expression. Among them , 146 genes involved in six hormone-signalling pathways were enriched , including 22 ABA- and 50 ethylene-related genes. Quantitative expression of selected genes involved in hormone-related pathways showed that ABA metabolic genes ( ABAG , ABAH2 , and ABAH4) , ethylene biosynthetic genes ( ACO1 , ACO2 , ACO5 , ACOH1 , ACS1 , and ACS7) and receptor genes ( PYL1 , PYL2 , PYL4 , and PYL6) were regulated by exogenous GABA , even at a 0.1 mM level. The production of ABA was negatively correlated with ABAH expression levels at different GABA concentrations. The increase of endogenous GABA , resulting from inhibitor ( succinyl phosphonate) of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase , affected the PYLs levels. Thus , GABA may be involved in ABA- and ethylene-signalling pathways. Our data provide a better understanding of GABA 's roles in the plant responses to environmental stresses.
