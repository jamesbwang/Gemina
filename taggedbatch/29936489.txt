 Background Although a significant amount of research has been conducted on handgrip strength and its association with anthropometric variables , very few researchers have focused on assessment of back strength and its relationship with anthropometric variables in cricketers. Objective To investigate the degree of correlation between handgrip strength and back strength in cricket players of different maturity levels and to find the correlations of handgrip strength and back strength with anthropometric variables of age , height , body<symptom> weight and body mass index ( BMI). Methods Twenty-four adolescents; aged 16.6 ± 0.8 years and 32 adult cricketers aged 24 ± 4.6 years were tested for height , body<symptom> weight , BMI , hand grip strength and back strength. t values , Cohen 's d and Pearson 's correlation coefficients were calculated. Results Hand grip strength and back strength were not found to correlate with each other at p ≤ 0.05 in adolescent players while a statistically significant large sized correlation was observed in adult cricketers at p = 0.001. Back strength and body<symptom> weight were found to have a statistically significant moderate sized correlation with each other ( r = 0.453 in the adolescent group and r = 0.355 in the adult group). Significant positive correlations were observed for left hand grip strength with height , body<symptom> weight and BMI and also between back strength and age in the adult population of cricketers. Conclusion A significantly large correlation exists between handgrip strength and back strength in adult cricketers with no such correlation found for adolescent cricketers. Data of the present study justify its utility in the case of selection , assessment and rehabilitation of cricket players.
