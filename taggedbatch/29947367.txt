 Muon spin relaxation ( μSR) experiments on a single-molecule magnet enriched in different Dy isotopes detect unambiguously the slowing down of the zero field spin dynamics for the non-magnetic isotope. This occurs in the low temperature regime dominated by quantum tunnelling , in agreement with previous ac susceptibility investigations. In contrast to the latter , however , μSR is sensitive to all fluctuation modes affecting the lifetime of the spin levels.
