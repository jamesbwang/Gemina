 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcome of young women with malignant transformation arising from mature cystic teratoma of the ovary ( MT-MCT) by comparing radical surgery and fertility-sparing surgery ( FSS). All patients treated with radical surgery or FSS for MT-MCT in multiple institutions were registered in this analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate clinical outcome , including overall survival ( OS) and disease-free survival ( DFS). From 1986 to 2016 , 62 patients with MT-MCT were treated in our group. The median follow-up period was 38.0 ( 2.0-227.9) months , and the median age was 54 ( 17-82) years old. Multivariate analysis revealed that only advanced stage was significantly correlated with poorer prognosis of patients ( hazard ratio ( HR) for death: 6.58 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.82-24.78 , P = 0.0048; HR for recurrence: 5.59 , 95 % CI: 1.52-21.83 , P = 0.01). Of a total of 13 women with stage I-II disease at less than 45 years old , 7 were treated with FSS , and there was no recurrence except for in one woman with stage II MT-MCT. There was no significant difference in long-term oncological outcome between radical surgery and FSS. FSS may be indicated for patients with stage I MT-MCT , who hope to preserve fertility , as no relapse was found after FSS.
