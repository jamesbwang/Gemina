 To evaluate the clinical value of volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) in exhaled breath for lung cancer ( LC) screening , a systematic review was performed. Systematic search for studies about exhaled VOCs for LC screening was conducted according to PRISMA. Thirty eight studies with 4873 participants met the criteria for inclusion in this systematic review. Generally speaking , the results suggest that exhaled VOCs have potential to screen LC and more studies are needed in the future.
