 Reproducible and stable transgene expression is an important goal in both basic research and biotechnology , with each application demanding a range of transgene expression. Problems in achieving stable transgene expression include multi-copy transgene silencing , chromosome-position effects , and loss of expression during long-term culture , induced cell quiescence , and/or cell differentiation. Previously , we described the `` BAC TG-EMBED '' method for copy-number dependent , chromosome position-independent expression of embedded transgenes within a BAC containing ~ 170 kb of the mouse Dhfr locus. Here we demonstrate wider applicability of the method by identifying a BAC and promoter combination that drives reproducible , copy-number dependent , position-independent transgene expression even after induced quiescence and/or cell differentiation into multiple cell types. Using a GAPDH BAC containing ~ 200 kb of the human GAPDH gene locus and a 1.2 kb human UBC promoter , we achieved stable GFP-ZeoR reporter expression in mouse NIH 3T3 cells after low-serum-induced cell cycle arrest or differentiation into adipocytes. More notably , GFP-ZeoR expression remained stable and copy-number dependent even after differentiation of mouse ESCs into several distinct lineages. These results highlight the potential use of BAC TG-EMBED as an expression platform for high-level but stable , long-term expression of transgene independent of cell proliferative or differentiated state.
