 Despite many studies attempt to identify the primary mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) , the key events still remain elusive. We have previously shown that a peptide cleaved from the acetylcholinesterase ( AChE) C-terminus ( T14) can play a pivotal role as a signaling molecule in neurodegeneration , via its interaction with the Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The main goal of this study is to determine whether a cyclized variant ( NBP14) of the toxic AChE-derived peptide can antagonize the effects of its linear counterpart , T14 , in modulating well-known markers linked to neurodegeneration. We investigate this hypothesis applying NBP14 on
