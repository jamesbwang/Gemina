 Details of the current UK drug and allergen exposure were needed for interpretation of reports of perioperative anaphylaxis to the 6th National Audit Project ( NAP6). We performed a cross-sectional survey of 356 NHS hospitals determining anaesthetic drug usage in October 2016. All cases cared for by an anaesthetist were included. Responses were received from 342 ( 96 %) hospitals. Within-hospital return rates were 96 %. We collected 15 942 forms , equating to an annual caseload of 3.1 million , including 2.4 million general anaesthetics. Propofol was used in 74 % of all cases and 90 % of general anaesthetics. Maintenance included a volatile agent in 95 % and propofol in 8.7 %. Neuromuscular blocking agents were used in 47 % of general anaesthetics. Analgesics were used in 88 % of cases: opioids , 82 %; paracetamol , 56 %; and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , 28 %. Antibiotics were administered in 57 % of cases , including 2.5 million annual perioperative administrations; gentamicin , co-amoxiclav , and cefuroxime were most commonly used. Local anaesthetics were used in 74 % cases and 70 % of general anaesthetics. Anti-emetics were used in 73 % of cases: during general anaesthesia , ondansetron in 78 % and dexamethasone in 60 %. Blood products were used in ≈ 3 % of cases , gelatin < 2 % , starch very rarely , and tranexamic acid in ≈ 6 %. Chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine exposures were 74 % and 40 % of cases , and 21 % reported a latex-free environment. Exposures to bone cement , blue dyes , and radiographic contrast dye were each reported in 2-3 % of cases. This survey provides insights into allergen exposures in perioperative care , which is important as denominator data for the NAP6 registry.
