 Chronic kidney disease has become an increasingly significant clinical and public health issue , accounting for 1.1 million deaths worldwide. Information on the epidemiology of chronic kidney disease and associated risk factors is limited in the United Arab Emirates. Therefore , this study aimed to evaluate the incidence and causes of chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 in adult United Arab Emirates nationals with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease. This retrospective study included 491 adults with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease ( diabetes mellitus or associated clinical disease) who attended outpatient clinics at a tertiary care hospital in Al-Ain , United Arab Emirates. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was assessed every 3 months from baseline to June 30 , 2017. Chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 were defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1 .73 m2 for â‰¥ 3 months. Multivariable Cox 's proportional hazards analysis was used to determine the independent risk factors associated with developing chronic kidney disease stages 3-5. The cumulative incidence of chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 over a 9-year period was 11.4 % ( 95 % confidence interval 8.6 , 14.0). The incidence rate of these disease stages was 164.8 ( 95 % confidence interval 121.6 , 207.9) per 10,000 person-years. The independent risk factors for developing chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 were older age , history of coronary heart disease , history of diabetes mellitus , and history of smoking. These data may be useful to develop effective strategies to prevent chronic kidney disease development in high-risk United Arab Emirates nationals.
