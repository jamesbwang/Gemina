 Progress in cancer treatment made by the beginning of the 21st century has shifted the paradigm from one-size-fits-all to tailor-made treatment. The popular vision , to study solid tumors through the relatively noninvasive sampling of blood , is one of the most thrilling and rapidly advancing fields in global cancer diagnostics. From this perspective , immune-cell analysis in cancer could play a pivotal role in oncology practice. This approach is driven both by rapid technological developments , including the analysis of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( cMDSCs) , and by the increasing application of ( immune) therapies , the success or failure of which may depend on effective and timely measurements of relevant biomarkers. Although the implementation of these powerful noninvasive diagnostic capabilities in guiding precision cancer treatment is poised to change the ways in which we select and monitor cancer therapy , challenges remain. Here , we discuss the challenges associated with the analysis and clinical aspects of cMDSCs and assess whether the problems in implementing tumor-evolution monitoring as a global tool in personalized oncology can be overcome.
