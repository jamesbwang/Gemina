 Lactate produced by Sertoli cells plays an important role in spermatogenesis , and heat stress induces lactate production in immature boar Sertoli cells. Extracellular signaling regulated kinase 1 and 2 ( ERK1/2) participates in heat stress response. However , the effect of ERK1/2 on heat stress-induced lactate production is unclear. In the present study , Sertoli cells were isolated from immature boar testis and cultured at 32 °C. Heat stress was induced in a 43 °C incubator for 30 min. Proteins and RNAs were detected by western blotting and RT-PCR , respectively. Lactate production and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) activity were detected using commercial kits. Heat stress promoted ERK1/2 phosphorylation , showing a reducing trend with increasing recovery time. In addition , heat stress increased heat shock<symptom> protein 70 ( HSP70) , glucose transporter 3 ( GLUT3) , and lactate dehydrogenase A ( LDHA) expressions , enhanced LDH activity and lactate production at 2-h post-heat stress.
