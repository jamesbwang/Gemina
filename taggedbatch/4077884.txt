 Introduction of silicon into hydroxyapatite ( HA) is one of the effective ways to modulate the bioactivity of HA-based biomaterials. The bulk and surface structures of silicate-substituted HA ( Si-HA) were characterized by using density functional theory calculations. The energetically favorable structures were identified from a number of candidate structures. Particular attention was paid to the surface structures of Si-HA , whose bioactivity is closely relevant to their surface atoms. Compared to the surface of pure HA , the Si-HA surface has similar surface energy but different charge distribution. Under the implicit solvent model , the exposed calcium/oxygen atoms become more positive/negative in net charge , resulting in a considerable change in the surface electrostatic potential at van der Waals distances. However , changes in the dissolution of surface calcium ions are not remarkable , as depicted by their activation energy leaving from the surface. Our calculations reveal that the surface structures and properties of HA were changed to some extent by silicate substitution , which provides some hints for understanding the experimentally observed changes in bioactivity and biodegradability of Si-HA that still remain controversial in many aspects.
