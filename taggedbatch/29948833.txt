 Toxic megacolon ( TM) is a potentially fatal condition characterized by non-obstructive colonic dilatation and systemic toxicity. It is most commonly caused by inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD). Limited data for TM are available demonstrating incidence , in-hospital outcomes and predictors of mortality. We sought to investigate incidence , characteristics , mortality and predictors of mortality associated with it. Data were obtained from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project ( HCUP) 's Nationwide Inpatient Sample ( NIS) database from January 2010 through December 2014. An analysis was performed on SAS 9.4 ( SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , NC). Patients below 18 years were excluded. A mixed-effects logistic regression model was developed to analyze predictors of mortality. Thus , 8139 ( weighted) cases of TM were diagnosed between 2010 and 2014. TM is more prevalent in women ( 56.4 %) than in men ( 43.6 %) , with a mean age of onset at 62.4 years , affecting whites ( 79.7 %) more than non-whites. The most common reason for hospital admission included IBD ( 51.6 %) followed by septicemia<disease><symptom> ( 10.2 %) and intestinal infections ( 4.1 %). Mean length of stay was 9.5 days and overall in-hospital mortality was 7.9 %. Other complications included surgical resection of the large intestine ( 11.5 %) and bowel obstruction ( 10.9 %). Higher age , neurological disorder , coagulopathy , chronic pulmonary disease , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , and renal<symptom> failure<symptom> were associated with greater risk of in-hospital mortality. TM is a serious condition with high in-hospital mortality. Management of TM requires an inter-disciplinary team approach with close monitoring. Patients with positive predictors in our study require special attention to prevent excessive in-hospital mortality.
