 In our previous study on natural products with fungicidal activity , pseudolaric acid B ( PAB) isolated from Pseudolarix amabilis was examined to inhibit significantly mango anthracnose ( Colletotrichum<pathogen> gloeosporioides<pathogen>) in vivo and in vitro. In the current study , sensitivity of 17 plant pathogenic fungi<pathogen> to PAB was determined. Mycelial growth rate results showed that PAB possessed strong antifungal activities to eleven fungi<pathogen> with median effective concentration ( EC
