 The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of polyhexamethylene biguanide ( PHMB) solution as a wound<disease><symptom> cleanser on bacterial load and bacterial biofilm in venous leg ulcers<disease><symptom>. Randomized controlled trial. The target population was adults attending the dermatology outpatient clinic of the Clinical Hospital of the Federal University of Minas Gerais , Brazil. The sample comprised 44 patients with venous leg ulcers<disease><symptom> recruited over a 6-month period. Participants were divided into 2 groups: the intervention group had their wounds<disease><symptom> cleansed with PHMB , and the control group had their wound<disease><symptom> cleansed with a 0.9 % saline solution. Tissue fragments of the wounds<disease><symptom> were collected for bacteriological analysis; transmission electron microscopy was used to identify the presence of biofilm. The bacterial load was reduced in both groups compared to baseline values; no significant difference was found when groups were compared. Correlation analysis between wound<disease><symptom> duration ( months) , wound<disease><symptom> area ( cm Â²) , necrosis<symptom> ( %) , variables , and bacterial count ( colony forming units ( CFUs)/ g) after cleansing showed a significant relationship between area of the wound<disease><symptom> and CFUs/g ( P = .0070 , r = 0.51). Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of bacterial biofilm in the wounds<disease><symptom> after cleansing with both solutions. The results of this study indicate that both PHMB and saline solution are effective in reducing the bacterial load in venous leg ulcers<disease><symptom>. However , bacterial biofilm was present after cleansing with both solutions. These findings provide important evidence regarding effectiveness of 2 common wound<disease><symptom> cleansers on bacterial presence in wounds<disease><symptom>.
