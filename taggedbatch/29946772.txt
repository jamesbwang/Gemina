 Otto Warburg observed a peculiar phenomenon in 1924 , unknowingly laying the foundation for the field of cancer metabolism. While his contemporaries hypothesized that tumor cells derived the energy required for uncontrolled replication from proteolysis and lipolysis , Warburg instead found them to rapidly consume glucose , converting it to lactate ( 1). The significance of this finding , later termed the Warburg effect , went unnoticed by the larger scientific community at that time. The field of cancer metabolism lay dormant for almost a century awaiting advances in molecular biology and genetics which would later open the doors to new cancer therapies.
