 Levels of circulating miRNA are considered to be potential biomarkers of acute myocardial infarction and disease progression. In this study , the expression levels of circulating miRNA-1 , miRNA-133 and miRNA-124a were investigated in a group of patients with acute myocardial infarction ( STEMI) and cardiogenic shock<symptom> ( CS) compared to controls. During the hospitalization period , miRNA-133 showed a significant up-regulation in the serum of STEMI and CS patients compared to controls , while the expression of miRNA-1 was significantly different only in CS. The expression of miRNA-124 was significantly higher in STEMI and CS. Furthermore , miRNA-1 expression was related to the level of circulating glucose in patients with STEMI. We also found a negative correlation between miRNA-133 and MMP-9 levels. MiRNA-124 expression was significantly related to the level of soluble ST2; the marker correlated to cardiac damage. All selected miRNAs are potential markers of cardiac injury in cardiogenic shock<symptom> , whereas miRNA-124a and -133 are markers of injury in STEMI. MiRNA-1 expression is related to circulating glucose in STEMI. None of miRNAs could be correlated to the extent of injury , progress of the disease , or prognosis of patient outcome. Therefore , the levels of circulating miRNA have no potential for becoming a biomarker of myocardial damage and as such would bring no further benefit compared to current markers ( Tab. 4 , Fig. 1 , Ref. 47).
