 Hypothermia<symptom> is a dangerous adverse effect that occurs in burn patients. Hypothermia<symptom> leads to decreased renal<symptom> blood flow and may decrease renal clearance of medications. Few human studies examine the effect of hypothermia<symptom> on drug clearance and no known studies examine its effect on vancomycin clearance in burn patients. This case report describes a 39-year-old female who suffered 60 % total body surface area third-degree burns. The patient required vancomycin , empirically , and for definitive treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>. During three of the vancomycin courses , the patient experienced significant hypothermia<symptom>. Vancomycin concentrations obtained during normothermia were found to be subtherapeutic or therapeutic. Concentrations obtained during hypothermia<symptom> were found to be supratherapeutic and rate elimination constants were found to be significantly decreased by 45 , 25 , and 31 % , respectively. These patient data suggest that hypothermia<symptom> can decrease vancomycin clearance in burn patients as evidenced by supratherapeutic vancomycin concentrations and decreased rate elimination constants. Burn patients should be monitored closely for hypothermia<symptom>. If hypothermia<symptom> occurs during treatment , vancomycin concentrations should be obtained frequently , even if renal function appears stable. Dosing based on concentrations may be necessary in order to avoid supratherapeutic vancomycin concentrations and associated adverse drug events.
