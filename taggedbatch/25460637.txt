 Particulate matter < 2.5 μm in diameter ( PM We jointly investigated the association of short and long-term exposures to PM Daily ZIP code counts of respiratory , cardiac and stroke admissions of adults ≥ 65 ( N = 2,015,660) were constructed across New-England ( 2001-2011). Daily PM Associations between short and long-term exposures were observed for all of the outcomes , with stronger effects of long-term exposures to PM We observed synergistic effects of short-term exposures to PM
