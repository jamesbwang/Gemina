 In spite of advances in surgical care and rehabilitation , the consequences of spinal<disease> cord injury ( SCI) are still challenging. Several experimental therapeutic strategies have been studied in the SCI field , and recent advances have led to the development of therapies that may act on the inhibitory microenvironment. Assorted lineages of stem cells are considered a good treatment for SCI. This study investigated the effect of systemic transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) in a compressive SCI model. Here we present results of the intraperitoneal route , which has not been used previously for MSC administration after compressive SCI. We used adult female C57BL/6 mice that underwent laminectomy at the T
