 Multi-strain mixed fermentation can provide a relatively complete lignocellulosic enzyme system compared with single-strain fermentation. This study was firstly to screen strains which have a strong ability to hydrolyse rice straw ( RS) enzymatically and enrich true protein ( TP). Then , the conditions in the process of SSF , including the optimum inoculum size of mixed strains , inoculation ratio , and different inoculation time of N. crassa 14-8 , were optimized. The experimental results showed that the highest TP content could be obtained by using N. crassa 14-8 , C. utilis , and P.<pathogen> chrysosporium<pathogen> as mixed strains , and 5 mM Mn
