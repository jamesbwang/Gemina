 Women who inject drugs are disproportionately affected by HIV<pathogen> and intimate partner violence ( IPV); however , the link between IPV and HIV<pathogen> remains under-researched among substance-using women in low- and middle-income countries. This study examined associations and additive effects of different forms of IPV victimization ( psychological , physical and/or injurious , and sexual) on HIV<pathogen> sexual risk behavior among women who inject drugs in Indonesia. Respondent-driven sampling ( RDS) was used to recruit 731 women from Greater Jakarta and Bandung , West Java. RDS-II weighted prevalence of any past-year IPV was 68.9 % ( 95 % CI 65.0 , 72.6) in Jakarta and 55.9 % ( 95 % CI 48.0 , 63.5) in Bandung. In separate logistic regressions controlling for socio-demographic covariates , all three forms of IPV showed statistically significant associations with sexual risk behavior. After adjusting for all IPV types , psychological ( OR 1.87; 95 % CI 1.17 , 2.99; p = 0.009) and sexual ( OR 1.98; 95 % CI 1.22 , 3.21; p = 0.006) IPV independently predicted women 's sexual risk behavior. Marginal effects models suggested that co-occurrence of multiple forms of IPV had greater adverse consequences: sexual risk behavior was reported by 64.1 % of women who did not experience any IPV , but increased to 89.9 % among women exposed to all three types. Comprehensive harm reduction services that integrate IPV monitoring and prevention are urgently needed to reduce both HIV<pathogen> and IPV.
