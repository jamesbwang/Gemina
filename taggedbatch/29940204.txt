 Modern requirements for designing efficient nanocarriers against diseases such as cancer are very complex. A suitable nanocarrier should indeed remain colloidally stable in the body , be biodegradable , target specific tumor cells , and release efficiently drugs. These challenging tasks can be overcome by using the chemistry of saccharides and polysaccharides. We discuss here recent applications of carbohydrates-based materials for providing biodegradability , enhancing contrast in bioimaging , a stealth effect for controlling the composition of protein corona , and targeting ability.
