 Although `` Girls are as good as boys at math '' explicitly expresses equality , we predict it could nevertheless suggest that boys have more raw talent. In statements with this subject-complement structure , the item in the complement position serves as the reference point and is thus considered more typical and prominent. This explains why `` Tents are like houses , '' for instance , sounds better than `` Houses are like tents ''- people generally think of houses as more typical. For domains about ability , the reference point should be the item that is typically more skilled. We further propose that the reference point should be naturally more skilled. In two experiments , we presented adults with summaries of actual scientific evidence for gender equality in math ( Experiment 1) or verbal ability ( Experiment 2) , but we manipulated whether the reference point in the statements of equality in the summaries ( e.g. , `` Boys ' verbal ability is as good as girls ' '') was girls or boys. As predicted , adults attributed more natural ability to each gender when it was in the complement rather than subject position. Yet , in Experiment 3 , we found that when explicitly asked , participants judged that such sentences were not biased in favor of either gender , indicating that subject-complement statements must be transmitting this bias in a subtle way. Thus , statements such as `` Girls are as good as boys at math '' can actually backfire and perpetuate gender stereotypes about natural ability.
