 Concomitant chronic kidney disease ( CKD) is common in patients with significant valvular heart disease ( VHD). This study sought to evaluate the clinical benefit of valvular surgery in patients with concomitant CKD.We evaluated 349 patients with significant VHD who were referred for surgery. Patients were divided into those with CKD stage â‰¥ 3 ( CKD patients; n = 88) and those with CKD stage 1 or 2 ( no CKD patients; n = 261). 63 patients did not receive surgery , of which 20 patients had CKD and 43 had no CKD. Mortality and change in eGFR were assessed after a median follow-up of 21 months.In the whole study population , 25 % of the patients had CKD and these patients had higher mortality than those with no CKD. The annual mortality rates of patients with CKD who did and did not undergo surgery were 7.9 % and 28.0 % , respectively. In patients with no CKD , the annual mortality rates of those who did and did not undergo surgery were 1.8 % and 2.3 % , respectively. Importantly , surgery was associated with significant survival benefit in patients with CKD ( log-rank test , P < 0.01) , but was neutral in patients with no CKD. Multivariable analysis confirmed the survival benefit of valvular surgery in all patients , which was most significant in patients with CKD. Furthermore , eGFR was preserved in patients who underwent valvular surgery but declined significantly in those who did not.CKD is common in patients with significant VHD and , if left untreated surgically , these patients exhibit a high mortality.
