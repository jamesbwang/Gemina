 Uveal melanoma ( UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults , with an incidence of 4 ⁻ 5 cases per million. The prognosis of UM is very poor. In the present study , our aim was to investigate the expression of mRNA and protein for somatostatin receptor types-1 , -2 , -3 , -4 , -5 ( SSTR-1 ⁻ 5) in human UM tissue samples and in OCM-1 and OCM-3 human UM cell lines by qRT-PCR , western blot and ligand competition assay. The mRNA for SSTR-2 showed markedly higher expression in UM tissues than SSTR-5. The presence of SSTRs was demonstrated in 70 % of UM specimens using ligand competition assay and both human UM models displayed specific high affinity SSTRs. Among the five SSTRs , the mRNA investigated for SSTR-2 and SSTR-5 receptors was strongly expressed in both human UM cell lines , SSTR-5 showing the highest expression. The presence of the SSTR-2 and SSTR-5 receptor proteins was confirmed in both cell lines by western blot. In summary , the expression of somatostatin receptors in human UM specimens and in OCM-1 and OCM-3 human UM cell lines suggests that they could serve as a potential molecular target for therapy of UM using modern powerful cytotoxic SST analogs targeting SSTR-2 and SSTR-5 receptors.
