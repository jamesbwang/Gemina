 The introduction of antiretroviral therapy ( ART) in South Africa began as part of the prevention of mother-to-child transmission programme. For significant reduction of vertical transmission , early antenatal care booking and ART initiation are necessary. This study aimed to evaluate ART initiation and booking practices of women attending antenatal care in eThekwini district during financial years ( FY) 2010/2011 and 2013/2014. An observational study used a retrospective chart review at four eThekwini district community health centres ( CHC). From these CHCs , records of women that initiated ART in FY10/11 and FY13/14 were reviewed and compared for ART initiation delays and booking practices. A total of 2749 pregnant women who attended antenatal care ( ANC) at the study sites were found eligible for ART; of these , 49 % ( n = 1334) attended ANC in FY10/11 while 51 % ( n = 1414) attended in FY13/14. In FY10/11 , 46 % ( n = 610) and 60 % ( n = 855) of the womenwere initiated on ART during pregnancy. The mean gestational age at booking for FY10/11 was 20.88 ( standard deviation ( s.d.) = 5.6) and 18.40 ( s.d. = 6.2) in FY13/14. The mean gestational age at ART initiation for women who initiated ART in FY10/11 was 26.30 ( s.d. = 6.02) and in FY13/14 it was 19.06 ( s.d. = 6.86). In FY13/14 ART initiations occurred within 4 days after booking. ANC booking before 20 weeks was found to have improved between the two years from 39 % to 58 %; however , on average , in both years women booked during the second trimester.
