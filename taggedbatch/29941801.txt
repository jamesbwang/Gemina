 Recent advances in unmanned aerial system ( UAS) sensed imagery , sensor quality/size , and geospatial image processing can enable UASs to rapidly and continually monitor coral reefs , to determine the type of coral and signs of coral bleaching. This paper describes an unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV) remote sensing methodology to increase the efficiency and accuracy of existing surveillance practices. The methodology uses a UAV integrated with advanced digital hyperspectral , ultra HD colour ( RGB) sensors , and machine learning algorithms. This paper describes the combination of airborne RGB and hyperspectral imagery with in-water survey data of several types in-water survey of coral under diverse levels of bleaching. The paper also describes the technology used , the sensors , the UAS , the flight operations , the processing workflow of the datasets , the methods for combining multiple airborne and in-water datasets , and finally presents relevant results of material classification. The development of the methodology for the collection and analysis of airborne hyperspectral and RGB imagery would provide coral reef researchers , other scientists , and UAV practitioners with reliable data collection protocols and faster processing techniques to achieve remote sensing objectives.
