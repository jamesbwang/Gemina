J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-This study aimed to assess the validity of an on-court tennis test ( specific endurance tennis test ( SET-Test)) and 2 heart rate ( HR)- based methods for estimating oxygen uptake ( V ( Combining Dot Above) O2) in competitive tennis players. Thirty-five male players performed a SET-Test to relate test duration ( minutes) and V ( Combining Dot Above) O2. Two weeks later , 16 players performed a simulated match play set where HR and V ( Combining Dot Above) O2 ( V ( Combining Dot Above) O2-PLAY , criterion value) were measured and then compared with V ( Combining Dot Above) O2 values predicted from the HR/V ( Combining Dot Above) O2 linear regression equations derived from the SET-Test ( pV ( Combining Dot Above) O2-TEST) and from the one set match play ( pV ( Combining Dot Above) O2-PLAY). Test duration and V ( Combining Dot Above) O2-TEST were strongly correlated ( r = 0.821 , p < 0.001 , SEE = 5.6 ml · kg · min) , indicating that SET-Test outcome is a somewhat good indicator of aerobic fitness in tennis players , likely to be useful for training purposes. pV ( Combining Dot Above) O2-PLAY and V ( Combining Dot Above) O2-PLAY ( criterion value) were strongly correlated ( r = 0.832 , p < 0.001) and SEE was moderate ( 3.5 ml · kg · min = 11.5 %). pV ( Combining Dot Above) O2-TEST differed from the criterion ( 32.4 ± 10.7 vs. 30.8 ± 8.6 ml · kg · min , p < 0.001) and , although strongly correlated ( r = 0.689 , p < 0.001) , an overestimation occurred ( mean Δ = 1.6 ml · kg · min = 4.9 %) , yielding a high SEE ( 4.8 ml · kg · min = 15.6 %). We conclude that ( a) SET-Test performance is a valid and moderately accurate predictor of V ( Combining Dot Above) O2; and ( b) the individual HR-V ( Combining Dot Above) O2 regression equation generated during tennis match play predicts V ( Combining Dot Above) O2 with greater accuracy than the regression derived from the SET-Test.
