 In Lebanon , cancer used to be regarded as a taboo and referred to as `` the disease '' and was rarely disclosed to patients. However , patients are now increasingly interested in knowing their cancer status but with varying degrees of information requested. The aim of this qualitative descriptive study was to explore the perceptions of cancer patients , their families , oncologists , and healthy individuals concerning the disclosure of cancer prognosis. In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 family members , 20 middle-aged cancer patients , 11 elderly cancer patients , 22 healthy individuals , and 6 oncologists at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. The interviews focused on the following: general perception of cancer in Lebanese society , type , and extent of information that should be disclosed , factors affecting patient autonomy , and elements contributing to the decisions taken by oncologists and patients. The oncologist 's compassion and communication with patients affected their emotional status greatly , and some gaps in communication skills of oncologists were in need of standardized training courses to improve the process of cancer status disclosure. Also , patients had an increased preference towards the disclosure of cancer prognosis , and a desire to know the truth and this need increased as the patient progressed to a terminal state. Future work should be directed at addressing the needs of cancer patients through every disease stage. More research and further deliberation are needed to confirm the findings of this study since the Lebanese Code of Medical Practice does not protect the right of full disclosure.
