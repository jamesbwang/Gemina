 Protein hydrolysates from food plants , such as legumes , have emerged as a new alternative to treat hyperglycemia , an important risk factor contributing to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) and its complications. The aim of this work was to assess antihyperglycemic activity , inhibition of Î±-glucosidase and intestinal glucose absorption , and acute toxicity of total hydrolysates and < 1kDa fractions from Phaseolus lunatus L. , Phaseolus vulgaris<pathogen> L. and Mucuna pruriens ( L.) DC. , obtained by hydrolysis with Alcalase In vivo results showed that three of six total hydrolysates and four of six < 1kDa fractions suppressed starch induced-postprandial hyperglycemia ( ED These results suggest that hydrolysates and < 1kDa fractions from P. lunatus , P.<pathogen> vulgaris<pathogen> and mainly M. pruriens are suitable candidates to treat or prevent T2DM.
