 The gold standard for estimating blood alcohol content ( BAC) after alcohol consumption is a blood sample analysis. An innovative technology to estimate BAC is based on impedance cardiography and bioimpedance spectroscopy ( BIS). This study investigated whether it is possible to estimate increasing blood alcohol levels during a drinking trial with bioimpedance measurement techniques. Twenty-one healthy volunteers were assigned to a test ( ethanol) group ( ETH) or a reference group ( H2O). After baseline measurements , the ETH group ingested 120 ml of vodka , followed by a resorption phase of 50 min. Then , bioimpedance and breath alcohol measurements were performed. Thereafter , 60 ml of vodka was ingested and another resorption phase of 50 min was followed by bioimpedance and breath alcohol measurements. This procedure was repeated until alcohol levels exceeded 0.4 mg/l. The H2O group performed in the same way with water. For all measurements , extracellular resistance ( Re) and the base impedance ( Z0) were computed. Regarding BIS , several parameters differed significantly between the ETH and the H2O group. Re increased in ETH ( p = 0.005) , but not in the H2O group when comparing the first and last measurements. Z0 also increased significantly in the ETH group ( p = 0.001). To conclude , with BIS measurements , it is possible to measure increasing blood alcohol levels.
