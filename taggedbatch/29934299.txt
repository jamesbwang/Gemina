 Lochnericine is a major monoterpene indole alkaloid ( MIA) in the roots of Madagascar periwinkle ( Catharanthus roseus). Lochnericine is derived from stereoselective C6 , C7 epoxidation of tabersonine and can be further metabolized to generate other complex MIAs. While the enzymes responsible for its downstream modifications have been characterized , those involved in lochnericine biosynthesis remain unknown. By combining gene correlation studies , functional assays , and transient gene inactivation , we identified two highly conserved P450s that efficiently catalyze the epoxidation of tabersonine: tabersonine 6,7-epoxidase isoforms 1 and 2 ( TEX1 and TEX2). Both proteins are quite divergent from the previously characterized tabersonine 2 , 3 epoxidase and are more closely related to tabersonine 16-hydroxylase , involved in vindoline biosynthesis in leaves. Biochemical characterization of TEX1/2 revealed their strict substrate specificity for tabersonine and their inability to epoxidize 19-hydroxytabersonine , indicating that they catalyze the first step in the pathway leading to hörhammericine production. TEX1 and TEX2 displayed complementary expression profiles , with TEX1 mainly expressed in roots and TEX2 in aerial organs. Our results suggest that TEX1 and TEX2 originated from a gene duplication event and later acquired divergent , organ-specific regulatory elements for lochnericine biosynthesis throughout the plant , as supported by the presence of lochnericine in flowers. Finally , through sequential expression of TEX1 and up to four other MIA biosynthetic genes in yeast , we reconstituted the 19-acetylhörhammericine biosynthetic pathway and produced tailor-made MIAs by mixing enzymatic modules that are naturally spatially separated in the plant. These results lay the groundwork for metabolic engineering of tabersonine/lochnericine derivatives of pharmaceutical interest.
