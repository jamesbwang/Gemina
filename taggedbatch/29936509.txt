 Pityriasis rosea<pathogen> ( PR) is a self-limiting exanthematous disease associated with human<pathogen> herpesvirus<pathogen> ( HHV<pathogen>) -6 and/or HHV-7 reactivation. In pregnant women , PR may be associated with pregnancy complications. To determine relevant risk factors in the development of negative pregnancy outcome in PR. Between 2005 and 2017 at the Department of Dermatology , University of Genoa , we recruited 76 women who developed PR during pregnancy. In 60 patients without known risk factors for intrauterine fetal death ( 30 with pregnancy complications and 30 without) we analyzed the pregnancy week of PR onset , presence of enanthem<symptom> and of constitutional symptoms , PR body surface area involvement , age , and in 50 patients ( 20 with pregnancy complications and 30 without) , the viral load of HHV-6 and HHV-7 ( copies/mL). In logistic regression analysis , early onset of PR ( p = 0.0017) and enanthem<symptom> ( p = 0.0392) proved to be significantly associated with pregnancy complications. HHV-6 viral load ( copies/mL) ( p < 0.0001) , constitutional symptoms ( p < 0.001) , and PR body surface area involvement ( p < 0.004) were also significantly associated with pregnancy complications. The onset of PR before week 15 and enanthem<symptom> may be considered major risk factors that should alarm the dermatologist. Constitutional symptoms and involvement of > 50 % of the body area may be considered minor risk factors.
