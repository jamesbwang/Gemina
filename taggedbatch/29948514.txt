 We attempted to overexpress Human Histone Deacetylase 1 ( HDAC1) in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. A synthetic gene coding for HDAC1 , and optimised for E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> codon usage , was cloned into pBADHisB , generating pBAD-rHDAC1. This construct was used to transform E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> TOP10 , and the target protein was overexpressed and partially purified. According to its elution volume from a Superdex 200 column , the partially purified rHDAC1 was obtained in aggregated form , i.e. , as an octamer. The dissociation of octameric HDAC1 was tested using several agents , among which sodium dodecyl sulfate was competent in partially dissociating rHDAC1 aggregates. When the enzyme activity was tested in vitro using We described a procedure for the overexpression in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> of recombinant HDAC1 , the purification of which in active form can be successfully performed , although yielding an octameric aggregate.
