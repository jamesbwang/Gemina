 Autosomal dwarfism ( adw) in chickens is a growth deficiency caused by a recessive mutation. Characteristic for adw is an approximately 30 % growth reduction with short shank. The adw variant was first recognized in the Cornell K-strain of White Leghorns , but the genetic causal variant remained unknown. To identify the causal variant underlying the adw phenotype , fine mapping was conducted on chromosome 1 , within 52-56 Mb. This region was known to harbor the causal variant from previous linkage studies. We compared whole-genome sequence data of this region from normal-sized and adw chickens in order to find the unique causal variant. We identified a novel nonsense mutation NP_001006244.1 :p. ( Trp59
