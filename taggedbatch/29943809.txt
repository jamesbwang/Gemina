 The management of HPV-positive women becomes particularly crucial in cervical cancer screening. Here we assessed whether detection of E6 or E7 oncoproteins targeting eight most prevalent HPV types could serve as a promising triage option. Women ( N = 1,416) aged 50-60 from Shanxi , China underwent screening with HPV testing and liquid-based cytology ( LBC) , with any positive results referring to colposcopy and biopsy if necessary. Women with HPV-positive results received further tests using DNA-based genotyping , E6 or E7 oncoprotein detection targeting HPV16/18 ( for short: E6 ( 16/18) Test) or HPV16/18/31/ 33/35/45/ 52/58 ( for short: E6/E7 ( 8 types) Test) respectively. Among HPV-positive women , E6/E7 ( 8 types) oncoproteins had lower positivity ( 17.37 %) compared with DNA-based genotyping for same 8 types ( 58.30 %) and LBC with ASC-US threshold ( 50.97 %); HPV16 was the genotype showing the highest frequency ( 8.49 %) for oncoprotein detection followed by HPV52 ( 3.47 %) , 58 ( 2.32 %) , 33 ( 1.54 %) , 18 ( 1.16 %) , 45 ( 0.77 %) , 35 ( 0.39 %) , and 31 ( 0 %). For detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or higher ( CIN3 +) , E6/E7 ( 8 types) Test had similar sensitivity ( 100.00 %) and superior specificity ( 85.94 %) as well as positive predictive value ( PPV , 22.22 %) compared to both LBC and DNA-based genotyping ( 8 types); For detection of CIN2 + , E6/E7 ( 8 types) Test was less sensitive ( 67.74 %) but still more specific ( 89.47 %) and risk predictive with PPV of 46.67 %. Notably , E6/E7 ( 8 types) Test remarkably decreased the number of colposcopies needed to detect one CIN2 + and CIN3 + ( 2.14 and 4.50). E6/E7 oncoprotein detection showed a good `` trade-off '' between sensitivity and specificity with more efficient colposcopy referrals , which is of great importance to maximize the benefits of HPV-based screening program , especially applicable for the areas with high HPV prevalence and low-resources.
