 The impact of concurrent exposure to neurotoxic metals is a significant threat to brain function , mostly in contexts of multiple exposures as seen in the developing world. Ninety-five children ( 46 boys and 49 girls , 6 to 11-year old) from Congo-Kinshasa were assessed for cognition using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children ( 2nd edition) and exposure to Cr , Cu , Zn , Co , Mn , As , Cd , Se , Hg , Fe , and Pb by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICPMS) in serum and urine collections. Concentrations of elements were all above normal ranges except for Cd , Se and Hg. General linear mixed effects models were used to predict neurocognitive outcomes with variable selection methods including backward elimination , elastic net , or subsets identified based on subject matter expertise. After adjusting for sex , age , and SES , urinary Co > 5 µg/l was associated with poor simultaneous processing ( memory) ( p = 0.0237). Higher excretion but normal concentration of Cd in serum was associated with better memory ( p = 0.03) , planning ( p = 0.05) , and overall performance scores ( p < 0.01); thus appeared to be neuroprotective. However , higher excretion of Zn had negative influence on the overall performance scores ( p = 0.02). Predictive neurotoxicology is a challenging task in contexts of multiple and concurrent exposures. Urinary Co > 5 µg/l is a risk factor for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in such contexts. The impact of heavy metals on cognition is dependent on concentrations of and interactions between toxic and essential elements.
