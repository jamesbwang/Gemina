 Redox-responsive nanoparticles having a diselenide linkage were synthesized to target pulmonary metastasis of cancer cells. Methoxy poly ( ethylene glycol)- grafted chitosan ( ChitoPEG) was crosslinked using selenocystine-acetyl histidine ( Ac-histidine) conjugates ( ChitoPEGse) for stimuli-responsive delivery of piperlongumine ( PL). ChitoPEGse nanoparticles swelled in an acidic environment and became partially disintegrated in the presence of H
