 Floral nectar is a reward offered by flowering plants to visiting pollinators. Nectar chemistry is important for understanding plant nutrient allocation and plant-pollinator interactions. However , many plant species are difficult to sample as their flowers are small and produce low amounts of nectar.We compared the effects of different methods of nectar collection on the amino acid composition of flowers with low volumes of nectar. We used five methods to collect nectar from 60 ( 5 Ã— 12)
