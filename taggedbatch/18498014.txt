 Resistance to therapy is a major obstacle for the effective treatment of cancer. Expression of synuclein-gamma ( SNCG) has been associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy. While reports on SNCG overexpression contributing to chemoresistance exist , limited information is available on the relationship between SNCG and radioresistance of cancer cells. Here we investigated the role of SNCG in radiation resistance in breast cancer cells. siRNA mediated knockdown of SNCG ( siSNCG) markedly reduced SNCG protein level compared to scrambled siRNA ( siScr) treatment. Furthermore , siSNCG treatment sensitized Estrogen Receptor-positive breast cancer cells ( MCF7 and T47D) to ionizing radiation at 4 to 12 Gy as evidenced by the significant increase of apoptotic or senescent cells and reduction in clonogenic cell survival in siSNCG treated cells compared to siScr treated cells. On the other hand , we established an
