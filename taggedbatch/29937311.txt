 The on-farm factors increasing the incidence of dark cutting were studied in 3145 pasture raised cattle consigned in 66 lots. Animal , environmental and farm management factors were recorded and pasture quantity , quality and mycotoxin concentrations were measured. The relative risk of dark cutting decreased by 26 % in cattle grazing pastures with magnesium concentrations exceeding 0.24 %. There was a 50 % increase in relative dark cutting risk of cattle drinking from dams compared to drinking from troughs. Feeding supplements ( hay/silage) in the last 7 days prior to slaughter reduced the relative risk of dark cutting by 25 %. A high prevalence of mycotoxins was detected in pastures across all farms. In this case pasture ergot alkaloid concentrations above 600PPB increased the relative risk of dark cutting by 45 % , while the presence of FumonisinB1 increased risk by 58 %. In contrast the presence of 3acetyldeoxynivalenol reduced the relative dark cutting risk by 37 %. Sex also affected the incidence of dark cutting , with heifers less likely to cut dark than steers by 47 %.
