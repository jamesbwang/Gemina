 Choline alphoscerate in clinical studies improved cognitive dysfunction in dementia , but it did not show any clear clinical benefit on mild cognitive impairment ( MCI). There is limited evidence of neuropsychological markers in showing the effects of cholinergic precursors in MCI. Object of this preliminary study is to evaluate the change of the P300 latency as a biomarker for cognitive function after taking choline alphoscerate in patients with MCI. Event related evoked potential study were done in baseline ( n = 27) and 3 months after taking choline alphoscerate ( n = 17). When compared to our previous reported control database , the difference of the P300 latencies between MCI and control group at baseline was statistically significant ( P < 0.01). Although Follow-up P300 latencies after taking choline alphoscerate did not show the significant change , the tendency of shortened P300 latencies was identified. Even though there are some limitations , choline alphoscerate could improve the electrophysiological markers in MCI patients. To identify the effect of cholinergic precursor in MCI and the usefulness of electrophysiological biomarkers , well-designed further study is needed.
