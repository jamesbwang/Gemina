 Sequential hydrogenation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH) cations drives a gradual transition from a planar to a puckered geometry and from an aromatic to an aliphatic electronic structure. The resulting H-induced weakening of the molecular structure together with the exothermic nature of the consecutive H-attachment processes can lead to substantial molecular fragmentation. We have studied H attachment to gas-phase coronene cations in a radiofrequency ion trap using tandem mass spectrometry. With increasing hydrogenation , C2Hi loss and multifragmentation are identified as main de-excitation channels. To understand the dependence of both channels on H-exposure time , we have simulated the molecular stability and fragmentation channels of hydrogenated PAHs using a molecular dynamics approach employing potential energies determined by a density functional based tight binding method. As the coronene fragmentation patterns depend on the balance<symptom> between energy deposition by H-attachment and the extent of cooling in between subsequent attachment processes , we investigate several scenarios for the energy distribution of hydrogenated PAHs. Good agreement between experiment and simulation is reached , when realistic energy distributions are considered.
