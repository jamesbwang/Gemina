 The direct anterior approach has gained popularity in total hip arthroplasty ( THA) over the past decade. However , there are few reports that describe the use of this approach for cases of complex revision. The purpose of this study was to report the surgical procedure and early clinical results of acetabular revision in the presence of bone defects using a Kerboull-type reinforcement device through the direct anterior approach. Eleven patients who had undergone acetabular reconstruction using a Kerboull-type reinforcement device for aseptic or septic loosening bone defects were enrolled. All procedures were performed using the direct anterior approach on a standard operating table. The mean age was 71.8 years , the mean period from initial surgery to revision THA was 14.5 years , and the mean follow-up period was 19.8 months. The Kerboull-type acetabular reinforcement device with cemented cup combined with allogenic femoral head bone grafts was used in all hips. The mean operative time and intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> were 148 min and 743 g , respectively. None of the patients required allogeneic blood transfusion. One patient required revision surgery 11 months postoperatively because of device displacement. No other major or minor orthopedic complications were observed. The direct anterior approach allows for less invasive acetabular reconstruction using a Kerboull-type reinforcement device.
