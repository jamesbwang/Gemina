 To delineate the timing of , indications for , and assessment of visitor restriction policies and practices ( VRPP) in pediatric facilities. An electronic survey to characterize VRPP in pediatric healthcare facilities. The Infectious<disease> Diseases Society of America Emerging Infections Network surveyed 334 pediatric infectious<disease> disease<disease> consultants via an electronic link. Descriptive analyses were performed. A total of 170 eligible respondents completed a survey between 12 July and August 15 , 2016 , for a 51 % response rate. Of the 104 respondents ( 61 %) familiar with their VRPP , 92 ( 88 %) had VRPP in all inpatient units. The respondents reported age-based VRPP ( 74 %) symptom-based VRPP ( 97 %) , and outbreak-specific VRPP ( 75 %). Symptom-based VRPP were reported to be seasonal by 24 % of respondents and to be implemented year-round according to 70 % of respondents. According to the respondents , communication of VRPP to families occurred at admission ( 87 %) and through signage in care areas ( 64 %) , while communication of VRPP to staff occurred by email ( 77 %) , by meetings ( 55 %) , and by signage in staff-only areas ( 49 %). Respondents reported that enforcement of VRPP was the responsibility of nursing ( 80 %) , registration clerks ( 58 %) , unit clerks ( 53 %) , the infection prevention team ( 31 %) , or clinicians 16 ( 16 %). They also reported that the effectiveness of VRPP was assessed through active surveillance of hospital acquired respiratory<disease> infections<disease> ( 62 %) , through active surveillance of healthcare worker exposures ( 28 %) and through patient/family satisfaction assessments ( 29 %). Visitor restriction policies and practices vary in scope , implementation , enforcement , and physician awareness in pediatric facilities. A prospective multisite evaluation of outcomes would facilitate the adoption of uniform guidance.
