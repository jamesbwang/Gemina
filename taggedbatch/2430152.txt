 Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery ( NOTES) has theoretical advantages over other approaches. This was a prospective cohort study of colorectal cancers operated on by NOTES ( transanally for rectal tumours , transvaginally for sigmoid tumours) between December 2013 and December 2015 , with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Eligibility criteria included ASA fitness grade I-III , BMI below 25 kg/m Sixteen patients were operated on by a transanal and four by a transvaginal approach. There were ten men and ten women , with a mean ( s.d.) age of 55 路 6 ( 12 路 1) years. Mean BMI was 22 路 4 ( 2 路 6) kg/m In carefully selected patients NOTES for colorectal cancer resection was feasible and effective.
