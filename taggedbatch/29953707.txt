 Activation of carbon-fluorine ( C-F) bonds is an important topic in synthetic organic chemistry recently. Among the methods for C-F bond cleavage , metal mediated and catalyzed β- or α-fluorine elimination proceeds under mild conditions compared with oxidative addition of C-F bond. The β- or α-fluorine elimination is initiated from organometallic intermediates having fluorine substituents on carbon atoms β or α to metal centers , respectively. Transformations via these elimination processes ( C-F bond cleavage) , which are typically preceded by carbon-carbon ( or carbon-heteroatom) bond formation , have been remarkably developed as C-F bond activation methods in the past five years. In this minireview , we summarize the applications of transition metal-mediated and- catalyzed fluorine elimination to synthetic organic chemistry from a historical perspective for early studies and from a systematic perspective for recent studies.
