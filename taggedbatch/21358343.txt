 To investigate the correlation between echinodermmicro tubule associated protein-like 4 ( EML4)- anaplasticlymphomakinase ( ALK) , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) and clinicopathological features in patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma according to International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society ( IASLC/ATS/ERS) international multidisciplinary classification of lung adenocarcinoma.Ninety patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma underwent surgical pathological classification. Ventana immunohistochemical staining of the EML4-ALK was performed. The mutation of EGFR and EML4-ALK was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) using the amplification refractory mutation system.The positive rate of EML4-ALK mutation was calculated as 6.7 % ( 6/90) , dominantly occurring in patients aged < 60 years. However , it was not correlated with the gender , smoking history , maximal tumor diameter , pleural invasion , lymphatic metastasis , or clinical staging. EML4-ALK fusion gene mutation was mainly associated with the predominant subtypes of acinar and solid tumors with mucin secretion. The mutation rate of EGFR was 60 % ( 27/45). EGFR gene mutation mainly occurred in the female , those with no smoking history and tumor size < 3 cm , whereas it had no association with age , pleural invasion , lymphatic metastasis , or clinical staging. It was histologically characterized with micropapillary , lepidic , and papillary subtypes.The mutation rate of EML4-ALK is relatively high in lung adenocarcinoma patients aged < 60 years , pathologically characterized with acinar and solid subtypes with mucin secretion. Female patients with no smoking habit , tumor size < 3 cm , pathologically characterized with micropapillary , lepidic , and papillary subtypes had a high mutation rate of EGFR.
