 ADAM17 ( a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17) is a membrane-bound enzyme that regulates bioavailability of multiple transmembrane proteins by proteolytic processing. ADAM17 has been linked to several pathologies , but its role in thoracic aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> ( TAA) has not been determined. The objective of this study was to explore the cell-specific functions of vascular ADAM17 in the pathogenesis and progression of TAA. In aneurysmal thoracic aorta from patients , ADAM17 was increased in tunica media and intima. To determine the function of ADAM17 in the major cells types within these regions , we generated mice lacking ADAM17 in smooth muscle cells ( SMC; We have identified distinct cell-specific functions of ADAM17 in TAA progression , promoting pathological remodeling of SMC and impairing integrity of the intimal endothelial cell barrier. The dual impact of ADAM17 deficiency ( or inhibition) in protecting 2 major cell types in the aortic wall highlights the unique position of this proteinase as a critical treatment target for TAA.
