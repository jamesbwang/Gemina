 Automated time-lapse cameras can facilitate reliable and consistent monitoring of wild animal populations. In this report , data from 73,802 images taken by 15 different Penguin Watch cameras are presented , capturing the dynamics of penguin ( Spheniscidae; Pygoscelis spp.) breeding colonies across the Antarctic Peninsula , South Shetland Islands and South Georgia ( 03/2012 to 01/2014). Citizen science provides a means by which large and otherwise intractable photographic data sets can be processed , and here we describe the methodology associated with the Zooniverse project Penguin Watch , and provide validation of the method. We present anonymised volunteer classifications for the 73,802 images , alongside the associated metadata ( including date/time and temperature information). In addition to the benefits for ecological monitoring , such as easy detection of animal attendance patterns , this type of annotated time-lapse imagery can be employed as a training tool for machine learning algorithms to automate data extraction , and we encourage the use of this data set for computer vision development.
