 The cricothyroid membrane is the most commonly accessed location for invasive surgical airway. Although the laryngeal handshake method is recommended for identifying the cricothyroid membrane , there is no clinical data regarding the utility of the laryngeal handshake method in cricothyroid membrane identification. The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of cricothyroid membrane identification between the laryngeal handshake method and simple palpation. After anaesthesia induction , the otorhinolaryngology resident and anaesthesia resident identified and marked the needle insertion point for cricothyroidotomy using simple palpation and the laryngeal handshake method , respectively. The cricothyroid membrane was confirmed with ultrasonography. Identification was determined successful if the marked point was placed within the longitudinal area of the cricothyroid membrane and within 5 mm from midline transversely. The accuracy of cricothyroid membrane identification using the laryngeal handshake method and simple palpation was compared. A total of 123 patients were enrolled. The cricothyroid membrane was correctly identified in 87 ( 70.7 % , 95 % confidence interval 61.8-78.6 %) patients using the laryngeal handshake method compared to 78 ( 63.4 % , 95 % confidence interval 54.3-71.9 %) patients using simple palpation ( P = .188). The time required to identify the cricothyroid membrane was longer when using the laryngeal handshake method ( 15 ( 3-48) seconds vs 10.9 ( 3-55) seconds , P = .003). The success rate of identifying the cricothyroid membrane was similar among the anesthesiologists who performed the laryngeal handshake method and also among otorhinolaryngologists who used simple palpation.
