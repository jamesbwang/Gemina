 The levonorgestrel intrauterine system ( LNG-IUS) is a contraceptive method that can cause irregular bleeding and cramping during the first 6 months of use. Expected side effects are common reasons given for LNG-IUS device discontinuation within 12 months of use. Anticipatory counselling regarding expected LNG-IUS side effects may reduce method discontinuation and improve patient satisfaction. Educational videos could improve anticipatory counselling for LNG-IUS users; however , none have been developed. This article describes the process of developing an anticipatory counselling video with input from women in the first 6 months of LNG-IUS use and from family planning ( FP) experts. We used a participatory , iterative process to develop an anticipatory counselling video about the first 6 months of LNG-IUS use. We developed a preliminary draft using evidence from the published literature. We sought feedback from 11 FP experts and 49 LNG-IUS users to revise the script before creating the final video. FP experts suggested balancing negative with positive information and using colloquial language. LNG-IUS users requested more detailed information on the LNG-IUS mechanism of action and expected side effects in the form of statistics , infographic animations , testimonials from LNG-IUS users , and technical as opposed to colloquial language. The final video is 6 min in length and features seven LNG-IUS users , three physicians , and infographic animations. Including input from FP experts and LNG-IUS users in the development process resulted in a 6-min anticipatory counselling video that will be piloted among patients on the day of their LNG-IUS insertion.
