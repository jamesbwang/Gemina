 Prurigo nodularis occurs with chronic pruritus and the presence of single to multiple symmetrically distributed , hyperkeratotic , and intensively itching nodules<symptom>. Diverse dermatologic , systemic , neurologic , or psychiatric conditions can lead to prurigo nodularis. Structural analysis demonstrated a reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density and increased dermal levels of nerve growth factor and neuropeptides such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Novel therapy concepts such as inhibitors at neurokinin-1 , opioid receptors , and interleukin-31 receptors have been developed. The mainstays of prurigo nodularis therapy comprise topical steroids , capsaicin , calcineurin inhibitors , phototherapy , and the systemic application of anticonvulsants , Î¼-opioid receptor antagonists , or immunosuppressants.
