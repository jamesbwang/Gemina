 To investigate the effect of smear layer on apical sealing ability in teeth obturated with mineral trioxide aggregate ( MTA) Plus as retrofilling materials. Fifty freshly extracted maxillary anterior teeth or premolars with single root canal were used in this study. All teeth were instrumented to master apical point 60 # by using the step back technique , obturated with lateral condensation technique , and then apical resected. A root end cavity was then instrumented with an ultrasonic diamond-coated tip. Then the selected teeth were randomly and equally divided into two groups ( n = 25). In the experimental group ( smear-) , the teeth were irrigated with 0.17 g/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA) to remove smear layer on the root-end cavity wall; in the control group ( smear +) , the teeth were irrigated with physiological saline. Five teeth were extracted to evaluate the cleanliness of root end cavity walls under a videomicroscope , respectively. The scanning electron microscope ( SEM) evaluation was also performed for the presence of smear layer and open tubule. For the additional 40 teeth , the root-end cavities were filled with MTA Plus. The quantitative apical leakage of each teeth was evaluated by measuring the concentration of leaked sucrose in apical reservoir on 1 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 35 , 42 , 49 and 56 days , respectively. The samples were stored at 37 Â°C and 100 % humidity for 56 days. Statistical analysis was done with ANOVA for repeated measurement design data. Removal of the smear layer did not cause significantly less apical leaked sucrose than that when the smear layer was left intact for 56 days ( P > 0.05). There were statistically significant differences at the concentration of leaked sucrose among different observation time points ( P < 0.05). It may be concluded that removing the smear layer may not be necessary in root-end cavities filled with MTA Plus.
