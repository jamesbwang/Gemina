 Forest<disease> catchments can produce high quality source water with a low turbidity. However , the combination of low turbidity , low organic carbon , and low temperature water conditions presents operating challenges in conventional water treatment processes. In this study , in-line filtration was tested using pilot-scale filter columns , and was found to be an appropriate option to treat a typical low turbidity water originating from the Rocky Mountains near Calgary , Alberta , Canada. When alum and cationic polymer were dosed simultaneously , in-line filtration produced high quality effluent with a turbidity and a particle count value of less than 0.1 NTU and 50 counts/mL , respectively. However , the alum and polymer doses and their ratios played important roles in the filtration efficiency. In general , short filter ripening times ( i.e. < 15 min) required an alum dose of at least 3 mg/L and an alum to polymer dose ratio of less than 180:1. A longer filter stable period was associated with lower alum and polymer doses , as long as their doses were at least 2 and 0.024 mg/L , respectively , and their dose ratio was maintained in the range of 30:1 to 130:1. The optimal alum and polymer doses were observed to be 3 and 0.072 mg/L , respectively. Filter performance was enhanced when higher alum and polymer doses were used for ripening , and lower doses were applied during the stable filtration period. In addition , in-line filtration resulted in the reduction of microspheres by 3.6 logs under the tested water conditions. Hence , a similar removal efficiency is anticipated for Cryptosporidium.
