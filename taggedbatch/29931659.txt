 Peritonitis<disease> is a serious complication and major cause of treatment failure in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis ( PD). Escherichia<pathogen> coli is the major pathogen in extraintestinal Gram-negative infections , including PD-related peritonitis<disease>. The outcomes of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> peritonitis<disease> in PD varied from relatively favorable outcomes to a higher incidence of treatment failure. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of bacterial virulence and host characteristics on the outcomes of PD-related peritonitis<disease> caused by E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. From January 2000 to June 2016 , a total of 47 episodes of monomicrobial and 10 episodes of polymicrobial E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> PD-related peritonitis<disease> , as well as 89 episodes of monomicrobial Gram-positive ( 56 Staphylococcus<pathogen> spp. and 33 Streptococcus<pathogen> spp.) PD-related peritonitis<disease> cases , were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical features , E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> bacterial virulence , and outcomes were analyzed. Compared to Streptococcus<pathogen> spp. peritonitis<disease> , E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> peritonitis<disease> had a higher peritoneal catheter removal rate ( 38 versus 12 %; P = 0.0115). Compared to the monomicrobial group , patients in polymicrobial group were older and had higher peritoneal catheter removal rate ( 80 versus 38 %; P = 0.0324). Treatment failure of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> peritonitis<disease> was associated with more polymicrobial peritonitis<disease> and immunocompromised comorbidity , longer duration of PD therapy , and more antimicrobial resistance. E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates with more iron-related genes had higher prevalence of phylogenetic group B2 and papG II , iha , ompT , and usp genes. This study demonstrates the important roles of clinical and bacterial characteristics in the outcomes of monomicrobial and polymicrobial E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> PD-related peritonitis<disease>.
