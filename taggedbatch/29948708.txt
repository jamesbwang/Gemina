 Chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) , phthalateesters , parabens , siloxanes and squalene , all of them classified as endocrine-disrupting chemicals ( EDCs) , have been reported to occur in all environmental compartments. The effects of EDCs on development , reproduction , growth , metabolism and obesity constitute a real public health issue. A list of EDCs ( > 40 compounds) were characterised in total suspended particulates ( outdoor soot: 92 samples) collected in July-September 2016 in an Algiers urban area; besides , settled indoor dusts ( 36 samples) were collected between November and December 2016 in schools , homes , manufacture and hospital of the same province. The analytical procedure consisted of ultrasonic bath extraction , column chromatography separation into fractions of different polarity and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric processing. The total loads of phthalates ranging from 6.0 to 347 ng/m
