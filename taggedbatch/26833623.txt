 The donation of multiple allografts from a single living donor is a rare practice , and the patient characteristics and outcomes associated with these procedures are not well described. Using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients , we identified 101 living multiorgan donors and their 133 recipients. The 49 sequential ( donations during separate procedures) multiorgan donors provided grafts to 81 recipients: 21 kidney-then-liver , 15 liver-then-kidney , 5 lung-then-kidney , 3 liver-then-intestine , 3 kidney-then-pancreas , 1 lung-then-liver , and 1 pancreas-then-kidney. Of these donors , 38 % donated 2 grafts to the same recipient and 15 % donated 2 grafts as non-directed donors. Compared to recipients from first-time , single organ living donors , recipients from second-time living donors had similar graft and patient survival. The 52 simultaneous ( multiple donations during one procedure) multiorgan donors provided 2 grafts to 1 recipient each: 48 kidney-pancreas and 4 liver-intestine. Donors had median of 13.4 years ( interquartile range , 8.3-18.5 years) of follow-up. There was one reported death of a sequential donor ( 2.5 years after second donation). Few postdonation complications were reported over a median of 116 days ( interquartile range , 0-295 days) of follow-up; however , routine living donor follow-up data were sparse. Recipients of kidneys from second-time living donors had similar graft ( P = 0.2) and patient survival ( P = 0.4) when compared with recipients from first-time living donors. Similarly , recipients of livers from second-time living donors had similar graft survival ( P = 0.9) and patient survival ( P = 0.7) when compared with recipients from first-time living donors. Careful documentation of outcomes is needed to ensure ethical practices in selection , informed consent , and postdonation care of this unique donor community.
