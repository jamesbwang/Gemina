 Hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) can escape from innate and adaptive immunity , making the immune response ineffective. Human leukocyte antigen E ( HLA-E) might regulate the antiviral function of immune response and contribute to the persistence of HCV<pathogen> and the severity of liver disease. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of HLA-E in the liver and its association with the severity of liver disease in HCV<pathogen> patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of liver biopsies from 125 HCV<pathogen> patients and from 20 control subjects without liver disease. Liver biopsies were reviewed and classified according to severity of fibrosis<disease> and inflammatory activity. The pathologist assessed the magnitude of HLA-E expression in a semiquantitative way , attributing scores from 0 to 3. Immunohistochemistry showed positive for HLA-E in hepatocyte and Kupffer cells. The rate of HLA-E positivity in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells was significantly higher in HCV<pathogen> patients compared to controls. The liver samples classified as severe fibrosis<disease> and necroinflammatory activity presented greater expression of HLA-E on Kupffer cells and hepatocytes , with a significant linear association. It indicates that HLA-E expression may have an immunomodulatory effect and a possible role in the severity of liver disease in chronic hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C.
