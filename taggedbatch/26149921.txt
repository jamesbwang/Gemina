 The pathology of Parkinson 's disease ( PD) is characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of phosphorylated α-synuclein ( α-syn). Protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A) is responsible for α-syn dephosphorylation. Previous work has demonstrated that α-syn can regulate PP2A activity. However , the mechanisms underlying α-syn regulation of PP2A activity are not well understood. In this study , we found that α-syn overexpression induced increased α-syn phosphorylation at serine 129 ( Ser129) , and PP2A inhibition ,
