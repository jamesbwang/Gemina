 The microbiome has received increasing attention over the last 15 years. Although gut microbes have been explored for several decades , investigations of the role of microorganisms that reside in the human gut has attracted much attention beyond classical infectious<disease> diseases<disease>. For example , numerous studies have reported changes in the gut microbiota during not only obesity , diabetes , and liver diseases but also cancer and even neurodegenerative diseases. The human gut microbiota is viewed as a potential source of novel therapeutics. Between 2013 and 2017 , the number of publications focusing on the gut microbiota was , remarkably , 12 900 , which represents four-fifths of the total number of publications over the last 40 years that investigated this topic. This review discusses recent evidence of the impact of the gut microbiota on metabolic disorders and focus on selected key mechanisms. This review also aims to provide a critical analysis of the current knowledge in this field , identify putative key issues or problems and discuss misinterpretations. The abundance of metagenomic data generated on comparing diseased and healthy subjects can lead to the erroneous claim that a bacterium<pathogen> is causally linked with the protection or the onset of a disease. In fact , environmental factors such as dietary habits , drug treatments , intestinal motility and stool<symptom> frequency and consistency are all factors that influence the composition of the microbiota and should be considered. The cases of the bacteria
