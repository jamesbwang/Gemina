 An efficient one-pot cascade process via unprecedented quadruple cleavage of BrCF2COOEt with primary amines to afford valuable fluorine-containing heterocycles is described , in which BrCF2COOEt plays a dual role as a C1 synthon and a difluoroalkylating reagent for the first time. Mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations suggest that a base plays an active role in the formation of the key intermediate isocyanides generated in situ from primary amines and difluorocarbene.
