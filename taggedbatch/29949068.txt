 In this report , we describe the knowledge and beliefs on causes and management of otitis<disease> media<disease> of an indigenous Filipino community with a high prevalence of otitis<disease> media<disease> that is associated with an A2ML1 variant. Community lectures and individual genetic counseling were provided as intervention. Knowledge , beliefs , and health care-seeking behavior pertaining to otitis<disease> media<disease> were assessed pre- and post-genetic counseling. Twenty-five heads of households were interviewed. Beliefs regarding etiology of ear discharge varied widely , with swimming in the sea as the most commonly cited cause of ear discharge. During the post-counseling session , poor personal hygiene , dirty environment , and familial inheritance were mentioned as risk factors for otitis<disease> media<disease> or ear discharge. Knowledge about the genotypes for the A2ML1 variant and otitis<disease> media<disease> diagnoses within the household influenced beliefs on the role of hygiene and genetic susceptibility to otitis<disease> media<disease> and attitudes towards health care-seeking behavior. Genetic counseling was associated with variable improvement in knowledge on otitis<disease> media<disease> and in their understanding of genetic susceptibility to otitis<disease> media<disease> due to the A2ML1 variant. Language barriers , literacy level , cultural factors , and the complex nature of genetic information made genetic counseling in the particular population a challenge. Insights drawn from this experience recommend follow-up visits in the community.
