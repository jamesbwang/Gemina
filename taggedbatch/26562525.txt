 Metastasis is the ultimate consequence of cancer progression and the cause of patients ' death across different cancer types. Patients with initial diagnosis of distant disease have a worst 5-year survival compared to patients with localized disease. Therapies that target primary tumors fail to eradicate distant dissemination of cancer. Recently , immunotherapies have improved the survival of patients with metastatic disease , such as melanoma and lung cancer. However , only a fraction of patients responds to immunotherapy modalities that target the host immune system. The need to identify new druggable targets that inhibit or prevent metastasis is , therefore , much needed. Tetraspanins have emerged as key players in regulating cell migration , invasion , and metastasis. By serving as molecular adaptors that cluster adhesion receptors , signaling molecules , and cell surface receptors; tetraspanins are involved in all steps of the metastatic cascade. They regulate cell proliferation , participate in EMT transition , modulate integrin-mediated cell adhesion , and participate in angiogenesis and invasion processes. Tetraspanins have also been shown to modulate metastasis indirectly through exosomes and by regulating cellular interactions in the immune system. Importantly , targeting individual tetraspanin with antibodies has impacted tumor progression. This review will focus on the contribution of tetraspanins to the metastatic process and their potential as therapeutic tumor targets.
