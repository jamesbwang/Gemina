 To investigate the presence of leukemia<disease> stem cells ( LSC) in acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) and find out the relative position of leukemia<disease> cells in the figures of flow cytometry , and to analyze the relationship between minimal residual diseases ( MRD) and the level of LSC , so as to explore the correlation of LSC changes with the curative effect and the prognosis during chemical therapy. A total of 85 samples were collected from 50 AML ( except M3) patients , including 50 samples from the newly diagnosed patients , 7 samples of AML patients with non-remission and 28 samples of AML patients with complete remission. All samples were used for detection of LSC from immune phenotype of CD34 The LSC was identified in the CD34 LSC exist in AML and the relative position are consistent with the leukemia<disease> cells in flow cytometry figures , the size characteristics and weak expression of CD45 are also similar to leukemia<disease> cells. The proportion of LSC decreases after chemotherapy. Detecting and tracking the LSC changes in bone<disease> marrow and combination with detecting minimal resident disease ( MRD) may contribute to evaluate the theraputic efficacy and prognosis of leukemia<disease> patients.
