 Silver nanowire ( Ag NW) based films are considered as a promising alternative for traditional indium tin oxide but still suffer from some limitations , including insufficient conductivity , transparency and environmental instability. We here report a novel etching synthesis strategy to improve the performance of Ag NW films. Different from the traditional methods to synthesize high aspect ratios of NWs or employ electrically conductive coatings , we find it effective to reduce the high-reactivity defects of NWs for optimizing the comprehensive performance of Ag NW films. In this strategy etching can suppress the generation of high-reactivity defects and meanwhile the etching growth of NWs can be accomplished in an uneven ligand distribution environment. The resulting Ag NWs are uniformly straight with a sharp-edged structure. The transparent conductive film obtained exhibits simultaneous improvements in electrical conductivity , transparency and air stability. Even after exposure in air for 200 days and no protective coatings , the film can still meet the highest requirement of practical applications , with a figure of merit 361 ( i.e. , FoM > 350). These results not only demonstrate the importance of defect control in the synthesis of Ag NWs , but also pave a way for further optimizing the performance of Ag NW-based films.
