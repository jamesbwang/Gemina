 A cultivar of fruiting bodies of Ophiocordyceps sinensis<pathogen> ( FBOS; OCS02) was analyzed for nutrients , bioactive compounds , and heavy metal content to showcase its potential as a competitive , sustainable , and safe alternative to wild types and other cultivars. A previous 28-day subacute toxicity study showed that doses up to 1 g · kg-1 did not cause any adverse effects in Sprague-Dawley rats. The OCS02 cultivar contained large amounts of cordycepin , polysaccharides , and essential and semi-essential amino acids ( 0.66 , 482.80 , 99.02 , and 101.04 g · kg-1 , respectively) compared with levels reported in wild types and in cultivated mycelia. β-1,3/ 1,6-glucan content was considerably high at 342.50 g · kg-1. The potassium level ( 5.14 g kg-1) tied in well with the low sodium content ( 0.121 g · kg-1) -6 times lower than amounts in wild types. We found no detectable levels of heavy metals such as lead , arsenic , cadmium , and mercury. The major amino acids found in FBOS ( 0CS02 cultivar) were arginine , lysine , serine , and threonine at 45.20 , 20.30 , 18.60 , and 18.20 g · kg-1 , respectively. The cultivated FBOS ( OCS02 cultivar) is a comparable alternative to wild-type and other cultivated strains of O. sinensis<pathogen>. It has potential as a nutraceutical to meet market demand.
