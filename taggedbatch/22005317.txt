 Sickle cell disease ( SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that results in a lifetime of anemia<symptom> , severe<symptom> pain<symptom> , and end-organ damage that can lead to premature mortality. While the SCD field has made major medical advances , much needs to be done to improve the quality of care for people with SCD. This study capitalizes on the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium ( SCDIC) , a consortium of eight academic sites aiming to test implementation strategies that could lead to more accelerated application of the NHLBI guidelines for treating SCD. This report documents the process to support the consortium by specifying the interventions being developed. This study consists of three steps. The Principal Investigator of each site and two site representatives who are knowledgeable of the intervention ( e.g. , study coordinator or the person delivering the intervention) will answer an online survey aiming to capture components of the interventions. This survey will be completed by the site representatives three times during the study: during the development of the interventions , after one year of the interventions being implemented , and at the end of this study ( after 2 years). A site visit and semi-structured interview ( Step 2) in the first year of the process will capture the context of the sites. Step 3 comprises of the development of a framework with the details of the multi-component SCDIC interventions at the sites. The outcome of this study , a framework of the SCDIC , will enable accurate replication and extension of published research , facilitating the translation of SCD studies to diverse populations and settings and allowing for theory testing of the effects of the intervention components across studies in different contexts and for different populations.
