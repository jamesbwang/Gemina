 Doppler ultrasonography ( Doppler US) plays an important role in evaluating patients with liver cirrhosis. This study aims to investigate the hemodynamic alterations of hepatic artery and portal vein among children with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension ( esophageal varices). We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study in Imam Hossein Children 's Hospital , Isfahan , Iran , in 2016. A number of 33 cirrhotic children with or without esophageal varices were selected through convenience sampling method to be compared with 19 healthy children as controls using color and spectral Doppler US. Portal vein mean velocities were 15.03 ± 7.3 cm/s in cirrhotics , 16.47 ± 6.4 cm/s in controls ( Alterations in Doppler parameters of portal vein including diameter and velocity may be the helpful indicators of liver cirrhosis and esophageal varices in children , respectively. Parameters of hepatic artery may not differentiate children with liver cirrhosis.
