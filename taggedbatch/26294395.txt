 This study investigated the role of HSP70 in modulating intestinal γδ T cells ' Th17 response in The intestinal HSP70 's expression and mRNA level were measured by Western blot and RT-PCR. The intestinal γδ T cell 's morphological changes were analyzed using immunofluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscope. The pro-inflammatory cytokines ' level was detected by ELISA. The isolated and purified γδ T cells were pre-incubated with HSP70 and their functions including proliferation , apoptosis , activation and production of IL-17 were also detected. Heat treatment augmented intestinal HSP70 expression and alleviated the clinical presentations in PI-IBS mice. Meanwhile , intestinal γδ T cells and local IL-17 level were increased by pre-induction of HSP70. HSP70 promoted the proliferation of PI-IBS mice 's intestinal γδ T cells , inhibited the apoptosis and stimulated these cells to secret IL-17 rather than IFN-γ. Our results suggest that HSP70 plays a protective role via up-regulating intestinal γδ T cell 's Th17 response in PI-IBS mice.
