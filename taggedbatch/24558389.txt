 There is a lack of screening tools for common mental disorders that can be applied across cultures , languages and levels of education in people with diabetes and hypertension. Aim: To develop a visual screening tool for depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> disorders that is applicable across cultures and levels of education. Setting: Participants were purposively recruited from two not-for-profit organisations and two public health facilities- a maternal mental health unit and a primary health care centre. Method: This was a qualitative cross-sectional study. Thirteen drawings based on the Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale depicting symptoms of anxiety<symptom> disorders and depression<symptom> were drawn. Participants described emotions and thoughts depicted in the drawings. Data were analysed through content analysis. Results: Thirty-one women ( 66 %) and 16 men ( 34 %) participated in the development of the visual screening tool. The mean age was 34 ( standard deviation ( SD) 12.46). There were 32 ( 68 %) black participants , 11 ( 23 %) mixed race participants and 4 ( 9 %) white participants. Two participants ( 4 %) had no schooling , 14 ( 31 %) primary schooling , 8 ( 18 %) senior schooling , 13 ( 29 %) matric qualification and 8 ( 18 %) had post-matric qualification. Participants correctly described 10 out of the 13 visual depiction of symptoms as associated with depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> disorders , with no differences between levels of education and cultural groups. Conclusion: Ten drawings were appropriate for inclusion in the visual screening tool for anxiety<symptom> disorders and depression<symptom> ( VISTAD). The VISTAD will be validated against the mini international neuropsychiatric interview ( MINI<pathogen>) in a primary care population with hypertension and/or diabetes.
