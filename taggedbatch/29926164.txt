 Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis ( CNH) is a benign auricular disease whose differentiation with nonpigmented tumors is mandatory. Clinical characteristics of CNH are well known , but there is no information about the dermoscopic features that could help differentiate CNH from squamous cell carcinoma and other non-melanoma skin cancers. To describe the dermoscopic appearance of CNH and to formulate a differential diagnostic model , we conducted a retrospective , single center , observational dermoscopic study on a sample of 189 biopsy-proven lesions<symptom>: 25 CNH; 26 squamous cell carcinomas; 62 basal cell carcinomas and 76 other benign and malignant tumors. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted by logistic regression. The most significant dermoscopic finding for CNH was a peculiar global configuration ( daisy pattern) , consisting of white<symptom> thick lines , radially arranged , converging to a central rounded yellow/brown clod ( an erosion covered by keratin or sero-crust). This pattern achieved 92 and 98 % of specificity for discriminating CNH with squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma , respectively. In conclusion , dermoscopy is valuable for the diagnosis of CNH as a first screening tool because of a consistent global dermoscopic configuration ( daisy pattern) , consisting of radially arranged white<symptom> thick lines surrounding a central rounded yellow/brown clod.
