 Campylobacter<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen><symptom> , a human gastrointestinal pathogen , uses nitrate for growth under microaerophilic conditions using periplasmic nitrate reductase ( Nap). The catalytic subunit , NapA , contains two prosthetic groups , an iron sulfur cluster and a molybdenum cofactor. Here we describe the cloning , expression , purification , and Michaelis-Menten kinetics ( kcat of 5.91 ± 0.18 s-1 and a KM ( nitrate) of 3.40 ± 0.44 μM) in solution using methyl viologen as an electron donor. The data suggest that the high affinity of NapA for nitrate could support growth of C.<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen><symptom> on nitrate in the gastrointestinal tract. Site-directed mutagenesis was used and the codon for the molybdenum coordinating cysteine residue has been exchanged for serine. The resulting variant NapA is 4-fold less active than the native enzyme confirming the importance of this residue. The properties of the C.<pathogen> jejuni<pathogen><symptom> enzyme reported here represent the first isolation and characterization of an epsilonproteobacterial NapA. Therefore , the fundamental knowledge of Nap has been expanded.
