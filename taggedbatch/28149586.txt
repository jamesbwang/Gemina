 Foreign bodies in the vasculature usually cause numerous problems for clinical physicians. Physician experience with diagnosing and treating non-iatrogenic foreign body migration in the venous system is insufficient. Here , we reported a 41-year-old male who had a foreign body in his left forearm following a work-related injury. X-ray films indicated a 3-mm high-density shadow in the superficial soft<disease> tissue of the left forearm. During the operation , the foreign body was imaged by a C-arm fluoroscope to provide a more accurate location. The foreign body was removed completely following a microsuture of the cephalic vein. The procedure was uneventful , and the patient remained asymptomatic after 6 months of clinical follow-up. This case indicated that the foreign body in the superficial tissue needed to be accurately diagnosed and located. X-ray and C-arm fluoroscope imaging should be combined with the patient 's medical history to ensure sufficient preoperative preparation.
