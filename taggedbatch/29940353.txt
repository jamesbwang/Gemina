 Cannabidiol ( CBD) has been reported to induce apoptosis in immune cells through oxidative stress-related mechanisms. The objective of the present study was to investigate the cellular mechanisms for CBD-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress in human monocytes. Exposure of freshly isolated human monocytes to CBD induced apoptosis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Time-course analyses revealed the induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS) at 1-2 h post CBD ( 16 Î¼M) exposure. By comparison , the CBD treatment rapidly elicited the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP) within 5 min , and the oxidation of cardiolipin , a major lipid component of the mitochondrial inner membrane , within 15 min. Moreover , CBD induced the release of cytochrome c ( Cyt c) from mitochondria. Mechanistic studies revealed that CBD-induced ROS production and apoptosis were not associated with the alteration of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase activity , the electron leakage through mitochondrial respiratory chain , and Fe
