 To compare the remineralization efficacy of using the MI paste plus according to manufacturer 's instructions to MI varnish and to using a modified method of MI-paste plus application. 100 enamel specimens were obtained from the buccal and lingual surfaces of 50 extracted human non-caries third molars. All specimens were challenged by a buffered demineralization solution for 4 days , and were divided in 4 groups with 25 specimens in each group. 25 demineralized specimens had MI paste plus applied for 4 min and then wiped out ( MI) , 25 specimens had MI paste applied followed by application of SE-bonding agent ( MI + Bond) , 25 specimens had MI Varnish applied according to manufacturer instructions ( MI Varnish) the rest of specimens served as controls ( C). All specimens were stored for 7 days in artificial saliva. All specimens had their surface hardness ( SH) measured by micro-hardness tester before/after the acidic challenge and after the treatment procedures. After the SH test all specimens were crosssectioned to obtain 100-150 micron thickness specimens to observe the lesion<symptom> depth before/after treatment by the TMR ( Transverse Micro Radiography) technique. TMR experiment showed that ( MI + Bond) and ( MI varnish) groups recorded significant decrease in lesion<symptom> depth and mineral loss of the tested subsurface lesion<symptom> p < 0.05. ( MI + Bond) group scored the highest significant regain of surface micro hardness results p < 0.05. ( MI varnish) and the modified application of MI paste are methods that can increase the efficacy of CPP-ACP in remineralizing the enamel surface lesions<symptom>.
