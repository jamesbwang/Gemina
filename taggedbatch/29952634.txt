 To describe the training periodization in Rugby-7s players competing in the Sevens World Series during a non-Olympic season. Workload data were collected over a 33-week period in twelve male players participating in a full competitive season. Workload was quantified using session RPE and GPS-derived data during training and competition. Self-reported wellbeing was assessed using a questionnaire. Each variable was analysed weekly and through 5 mesocycles ( Pre-season , In-season 1-4) , each of which ended with competition blocks. The perceived load decreased throughout the season for the full squad ( -68 ± 26 % between pre-season and final competitive block , large effect) and when unavailable players were removed from the analysis ( -38 ± 42 % , moderate). Weekly perceived load was highly variable with a typical periodization in 4 phases during each mesocycle ( regeneration , training overload , taper and competition). During the pre-season , the workload was higher during the overload training phase than during the competitive period ( range: +23-59 % , large to very large , for the distance covered above individual maximal aerobic speed and the number of accelerations). This observation no longer persisted during the in-season. The wellbeing score decreased almost certainly from In-3 ( moderate). These results highlighted the apparent difficulty in maintaining high-load training periods throughout the season in players engaged on the Sevens World Series despite ~ 4-7 training weeks separating each competitive block. This observation was likely explained by the difficulties inherent to the Sevens World Series ( risk of contact injury , calendar and multiple long-haul travel) and potentially by limited squad rotation policies.
