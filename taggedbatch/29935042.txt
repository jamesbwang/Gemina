 FlaG homologue has been found in several bacteria including spirochetes; however , its function is poorly characterised. In this report , we investigated the role of TDE1473 , a putative FlaG , in the spirochete Treponema<pathogen> denticola<pathogen> , a keystone pathogen of periodontitis<disease>. TDE1473 resides in a large gene operon that is controlled by a Ïƒ
