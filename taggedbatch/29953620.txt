 Artificial teeth have several advantages in preclinical training. The aim of this study is to three-dimensionally ( 3D) print accurate artificial teeth using scans from X-ray microtomography ( XMT). Extracted and artificial teeth were imaged at 90 kV and 40 kV , respectively , to create detailed high contrast scans. The dataset was visualised to produce internal and external meshes subsequently exported to 3D modelling software for modification before finally sending to a slicing program for printing. After appropriate parameter setting , the printer deposited material in specific locations layer by layer , to create a 3D physical model. Scans were manipulated to ensure a clean model was imported into the slicing software , where layer height replicated the high spatial resolution that was observed in the XMT scans. The model was then printed in two different materials ( polylactic acid and thermoplastic elastomer). A multimaterial print was created to show the different physical characteristics between enamel and dentine.
