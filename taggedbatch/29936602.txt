 To establish the preventable and potentially preventable death rates in a mature trauma center and to identify the causes of death and highlight the lessons learned from these cases. We analyzed data from a Level-1 Trauma Center Registry , collected over a 15-year period. Data on demographics , timing of death , and potential errors were collected. Deaths were judged as preventable ( PD) , potentially preventable ( PPD) , or non-preventable ( NPD) , following a strict external peer-review process. During the 15-year period , there were 874 deaths , 15 ( 1.7 %) and 6 ( 0.7 %) of which were considered PPDs and PDs , respectively. Patients in the PD and PPD groups were not sicker and had less severe head injury than those in the NPD group. The time-death distribution differed according to preventability. We identified 21 errors in the PD and PPD groups , but only 61 ( 7.3 %) errors in the NPD group ( n = 853). Errors in judgement accounted for the majority and for 90.5 % of the PD and PPD group errors. Although the numbers of PDs and PPDs were low , denoting maturity of our trauma center , there are important lessons to be learned about how errors in judgment led to deaths that could have been prevented.
