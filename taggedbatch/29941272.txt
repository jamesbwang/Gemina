 The detection of acyl homoserine lactones ( AHLs) in activated sludge is essential for clarifying their function in wastewater treatment processes. An LC-MS/MS method was developed for the detection of AHLs in both the aqueous and solid phases of activated sludge. In addition , the effects of proteases and extracellular polymeric substances ( EPS) on the detection of AHLs were evaluated by adding protease inhibitors and extracting EPS , respectively. Recoveries of each AHL were improved by adding 50Î¼L of protease inhibitor , and recoveries were also improved from 0 to 56.9 % to 24.2 % -105.8 % by EPS extraction. Applying the developed method to determine the type and concentration of AHLs showed that C
