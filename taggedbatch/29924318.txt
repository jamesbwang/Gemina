 This study investigates the accuracy of the reporting of medication use by proxy- and self-respondents , and it compares the prognostic value of the number of medications from survey and registry data for predicting mortality across self- and proxy-respondents. The study is based on the linkage of the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins and the Danish 1905-Cohort Study with the Danish National Prescription Registry. We investigated the concordance between survey and registry data , and the prognostic value of medication use when assessed using survey and registry data , to predict mortality for self- and proxy-respondents at intake surveys. Among self-respondents , the agreement was moderate ( κ = 0.52-0.58) for most therapeutic groups , whereas among proxy-respondents , the agreement was low<symptom> to moderate ( κ = 0.36-0.60). The magnitude of the relative differences was , generally , greater among proxies than among self-respondents. Each additional increase in the total number of medications was associated with 7 % -8 % mortality increase among self- and 4 % -6 % mortality increase among proxy-respondents in both the survey and registry data. The predictive value of the total number of medications estimated from either data source was lower among proxies ( c-statistic = 0.56-0.58) than among self-respondents ( c-statistic = 0.74). The concordance between survey and registry data regarding medication use and the predictive value of the number of medications for mortality were lower among proxy- than among self-respondents.
