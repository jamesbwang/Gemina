 MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) play crucial regulatory roles in plant growth and development by interacting with RNA molecules , including messenger RNAs ( mRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs); however , the genetic networks of miRNAs and their targets influencing the phenotypes of perennial trees remain to be investigated. Here , we integrated expression profiling and association analysis of underlying physiology and expression traits to dissect the allelic variations and genetic interactions of
