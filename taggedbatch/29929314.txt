 Hexavalent chromium ( Cr ( VI)) is a prominent toxic metal with significant adverse human health effects. Photocatalytic reduction of Cr ( VI) to less-toxic trivalent chromium ( Cr ( III)) is a promising method for removing Cr ( VI) from aquatic environments. However , this technique often suffers from electron-hole recombination of semiconductors and poor reduction efficiency. The photoelectrocatalytic microbial fuel cell ( Photo-MFC) , which can use wastewater and light to recover electricity , has recently been proven to improve the separation of photocarriers of semiconductors and enhance cathodic reduction of pollutants. Here , the reduction of Cr ( VI) was investigated in a Photo-MFC with a Pd-decorated p-type silicon nanowire ( Pd/SiNW) photocathode and a bioanode under visible light. The Cr ( VI) reduction efficiency reached 98.7 % in 8 h under visible light , which was much higher than that under dark condition ( 56.2 %) and open-circuit condition ( 19.4 %). The enhanced Cr ( VI) removal was mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Pd/SiNW photocathode and bioanode. Cr ( VI) reduction in the Photo-MFC fitted well with pseudo-first-order kinetics. The kinetics constants and reduction efficiencies of Cr ( VI) decreased with the increase of pH , initial Cr ( VI) concentration and external resistance. This work provides a promising alternative to mitigate Cr ( VI) pollution in aquatic environments.
