 To identify location and number of insulinomas before operation is very important for improving the cure rate. The objective of the study was to assess performance of CT during celiac artery angiography for preoperative localization of clinically suspected small insulinomas ( < 2 cm in diameter). From January 2013 to November 2016 , 42 patients with hypoglycemic symptoms underwent celiac artery angiography , superior mesenteric artery angiography and CT during celiac artery angiography by a combined CT/digital subtraction angiography system , MIYABI Angio CT plus an Artiszeeceiling ( SIEMENS , Germany). Patient group consisted of 13 males and 29 females , age 17-69 years ( average , 45.4 Â± 13.5 y). After diagnosis , all 42 patients were operated. Obtained images were retrospectively analyzed and compared with findings from post-operation pathology. All interventional radiology procedures were performed successfully with no complications. Sensitivity of angiography alone for insulinoma was 76.1 % ( 32/42) , at combined CT/digital subtraction angiography , 4 more nodules<symptom> were found ( sensitivity , 85.7 % , 36/42) , while 6 false-negatives were observed ( all false negative lesions<symptom> were less than 2 cm). A total of 64 ml to 80 ml contrast media was used per patient. CT during celiac artery angiography is a sensitive diagnostic procedure for localizing insulinomas. Combined with angiography , it can prioritize the pancreatic region for exploration and guide a pancreatic resection. Ethical approval was obtained from the Hospital Research Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study. Duan Feng , Bai Yan-hua and Cui Li are co-first authors.
