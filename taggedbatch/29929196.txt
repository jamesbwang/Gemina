 Toll-like receptors ( TLRs) have been implicated in myocardial ischemia/ reperfusion ( I/R) injury. We examined the effect of CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide ( ODN) on myocardial I/R injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with either CpG-ODN or control ODN 1 h prior to myocardial ischemia ( 30 min) followed by reperfusion. Rats treated with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS) served as I/R controls ( n = 8/group). Infarct size was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and Evans blue straining. Cardiac function was examined by echocardiography before and up to 14 days after myocardial I/R. CpG-ODN administration significantly increased infarct size and reduced cardiac function and survival rate after myocardial I/R , compared to the PBS-treated I/R group. Control-ODN did not alter I/R-induced myocardial infarct size , cardiac dysfunction , and survival rate. Additionally , CpG-ODN promoted I/R-induced myocardial apoptosis and cleaved caspase-3 levels in the myocardium. CpG-ODN increased TLR9 activation and p38 phosphorylation in the myocardium. In vitro data also suggested that CpG-ODN treatment induced TLR9 activation and p38 phosphorylation. Importantly , p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) inhibition abolished CpG-ODN-induced cardiac injury. CpG-ODN , the TLR9 ligand , accelerates myocardial I/R injury. The mechanisms involve activation of the TLR9-p38 MAPK signaling pathway.
