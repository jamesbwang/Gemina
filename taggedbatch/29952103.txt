 Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1) , caused by germ line mutations of the NF1 tumor-suppressor gene , is one of the most common autosomal dominant disorders. Here , we reported a NF1 patient with the mutation NF1 c. 4367 +1 G > C. This sequence change locates at the first nucleotide of NF1 intron 32 within the consensus splice site. Compared with NF1 c. 4367G > C predicted to potentially damage the wild-type donor site at c. 4367 , the NF1 c. 4367 +1 G > C potentially abolishes this wild-type donor site by in silico analysis. In vitro minigene assay revealed that the NF1 c. 4367 +1 G > C may cause exon 32 skipping. Our result provides further evidence for its clinical significance of NF1 c. 4367 +1 G > C in clinical practise.
