 Ascoviruses are circular double-stranded DNA viruses that infect insects. Herein we sequenced and analyzed the genome of the previously unrecorded ascovirus isolate Heliothis virescens ascovirus 3i ( HvAV-3i). The genome size is 185,650 bp with 181 hypothetical open reading frames ( ORFs). Additionally , definition based on ascovirus repeated ORFs ( aros) is proposed; whereby the 29 aros from all sequenced Ascoviridae genomes are divided into six distinct groups. The topological relationship among the isolates of Heliothis virescens ascovirus 3a is ( HvAV-3f , ( HvAV-3h , ( HvAV-3e , ( HvAV-3g , HvAV-3i)))) with every clade well supported by a Bayesian posterior probability of 1.00 and a Bootstrap value of 100 %.
