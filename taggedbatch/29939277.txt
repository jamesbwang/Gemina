 Although organ shortage is a rising problem , organs from HCV RNA positive donors are not routinely transplanted in HCV negative individuals. Since HCV only infects hepatocytes , other organs such as kidneys are merely contaminated with HCV via the blood. We here established a protocol to reduce HCV virions during the cold ischemic time. Standard virological assays were used to investigate the effect of antivirals , including methylene blue ( MB) , in different preservation solutions. Kidneys from mini<pathogen> pigs were contaminated with Jc1 or HCV RNA positive human serum. Afterwards , organs were flushed with MB. Hypothermic machine perfusion was used to optimize reduction of HCV. Three different antivirals were investigated for their ability to inactivate HCV in vitro. Only MB completely inactivated HCV in the presence of all perfusion solutions. HCV contaminated kidneys from mini<pathogen> pigs were treated with MB and hypothermic machine perfusion without any negative effect on the graft. Human liver-uPA-SCID mice did not establish HCV infection after inoculation with flow through from these kidneys. This proof of concept study is a first step to reduce transmission of infectious HCV particles in the transplant setting and might serve as a model for other relevant pathogens.
