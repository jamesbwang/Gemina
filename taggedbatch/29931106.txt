 Group A Streptococcus<pathogen> ( GAS) is the most common bacterial cause of pediatric acute pharyngitis<disease><symptom> , and its quick identification is important for subsequent treatment. We sought to determine whether molecular GAS-based testing can successfully replace GAS antigen testing and subsequent culture in a pediatric urgent care center. We tested 160 patient oropharyngeal<disease> samples by a rapid antigen GAS test , the Alere i Strep A test , and throat<symptom> culture in a pediatric urgent care setting and calculated basic statistical metrics. The sensitivity and specificity of the molecular test were 98 % and 100 % , respectively , compared with culture. There was a 9 % false-positive rate with the rapid antigen-based testing. The Alere test is sufficiently sensitive and specific for definitive GAS testing in a pediatric urgent care setting. This implementation has enabled us to provide definitive patient results at the time of each patient encounter.
