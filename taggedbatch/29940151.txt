 To determine individual and joint effects of pulse pressure and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> treatment intensity on serious adverse events in the Systolic Blood<symptom> Pressure<symptom> Intervention Trial ( SPRINT). Pulse pressure = systolic- diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> treatment intensity in the control arm was ≤ 140 mmHg and in the intensive arm was ≤ 120 mmHg. The primary outcome was a 5-point composite of hypotension<symptom> , syncope , electrolyte abnormalities , acute<symptom> renal insufficiency , or injurious falls. In 9,361 SPRINT participants , the incident rate for the primary outcome per 1000 person-years increased with higher pulse pressure category ≤ 49: 20.4 ( 17.2-24.1) , 50-59: 24.5 ( 21.3-28.2) , 60-69: 31.7 ( 27.7-36.2) , ≥ 70: 44.6 ( 39.8-49.9) , P Wider pulse pressure and intensive blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> treatment individually were associated with the composite adverse event outcome. A modest effect modification of pulse pressure and treatment intensity lead to additional adverse events when both were present. Clinicians should use caution in treating older patients with elevated pulse pressure to an intensive blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> treatment target.
