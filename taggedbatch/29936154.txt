 Unconventional oil and gas development is achieved through a series of sub-processes , which utilize large amounts of water , proppant , and chemical additives to retrieve sequestered hydrocarbons from low permeability petroliferous strata. As a result , a large amount of wastewater is produced , which is traditionally disposed of via subsurface injection into non-productive stratum throughout the country. However , this method of waste management has been linked to the induction of seismic events in a number of regions across North<pathogen> America , calling into question the environmental stewardship and sustainability of subsurface waste disposal. Advancements in water treatment technologies have improved the efficacy and financial viability of produced water recycling for beneficial reuse in the oil and gas sector. This review will cover the various treatment options that are currently being utilized in shale energy basins to remove organic , inorganic , and biological constituents , as well as some emerging technologies that are designed to remove pertinent contaminants that would otherwise preclude the reuse of produced water for production well stimulation.
