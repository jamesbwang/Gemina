 Food web theory suggests that the placement of a weak interaction is critical such that under some conditions even one well-placed weak interaction can stabilise multiple strong interactions. This theory suggests that complex stable webs may be built from pivotal weak interactions such that the removal of even one to a few keystone interactions can have significant cascading impacts on whole system diversity and structure. However , the connection between weak interactions , derived from the theory of modular food web components , and keystone species , derived from empirical results , is not yet well understood. Here , we develop numerical techniques to detect potential oscillators hidden in complex food webs , and show that , both in random and real food webs , keystone consumer-resource interactions often operate to stabilise them. Alarmingly , this result suggests that nature frequently may be dangerously close to precipitous change with even the loss of one or a few weakly interacting species.
