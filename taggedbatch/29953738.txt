 The incidence and mortality rate of urological cancers is increasing yearly. Niclosamide has been repurposed as an anti-cancer drug in recent years. Synthesized derivative of niclosamide was testified for its anti-cancer activity in urological cancers. MTT assay was used to measure the cytotoxicity effect of niclosamide and its derivatives in urological cancer cell lines. Migratory ability was monitored by scratch migration assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle changes were analyzed by annexin V and PI staining. The apoptosis-related signal proteins were evaluated by western blotting. T24 had the best drug sensitivity with the lowest IC
