 The synthesis of mono ( formazanate) iron complexes is described. In the presence of tetrabutylammonium halides , salt metathesis reactions afford the ferrate ( ii) complexes ( Bu4N) ( LFeX2) ( L = PhNNC ( p-tol) NNPh; X = Cl , Br) in good yield , and the products are characterized in detail. The high-spin ferrate ( ii) complexes show cyclic voltammograms that are consistent with reversible , ligand-based one-electron reduction. The halides in these ferrate ( ii) compounds are labile , and are displaced by 4-methoxyphenyl isocyanide ( 4 equiv.) as evidenced by formation of the low-spin , cationic octahedral complex ( LFe ( CNC6H4 ( p-OMe)) 4) ( Br). Thus , a straightforward route to mono ( formazanate) iron ( ii) complexes is established.
