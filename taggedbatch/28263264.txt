 A 39-year-old lady with past history of vitreoretinal surgery for retinal detachment and cataract surgery with Intraocular lens implantation was diagnosed as uncontrolled glaucoma. She had high myopia. She underwent Trabeculectomy and following which she presented with massive suprachoroidal hemorrhage<symptom> in the first postoperative day with severe<symptom> loss<symptom> of vision. This case depicts the risk of suprachoroidal hemorrhage<symptom> in a high myopic vitrectomised eye following glaucoma filtration surgery. It also demonstrates a favorable outcome following intervention for postoperative Suprachoroidal hemorrhage<symptom>. At present , there is no evidence in literature of such event in a high myopic Vitrectomised eye following Trabeculectomy.
