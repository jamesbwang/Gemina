 Infertility<symptom> as well as obesity are risng global concern. Whilst there is an established association between female obesity and infertility<symptom> , a similar link is yet to be proven in men. To determine the effects of elevated body mass index ( BMI) on semen quality among male partners of infertile couples attending an infertility<symptom> clinic. In this cross-sectional study , 206 men who met the inclusion criteria were recruited for the study. Selected participants were grouped according to their BMI ( kg/m The number of participants with normal BMI was 110 ( 53.4 %) while those with elevated BMI were 96 ( 46.6 %). Of the participants in elevated BMI group , 52 ( 25.2 %) were overweight and 44 ( 21.4 %) were obese. There was no statistically significant difference in the semen quality as well as the pattern of semen parameter abnormalities between males with normal and elevated BMI ( overweight or obese) ( p = 0.813). Elevated BMI did not significantly influence semen quality.
