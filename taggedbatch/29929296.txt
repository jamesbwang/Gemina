 Ambient inhalable particulate matter ( PM) is a serious health concern worldwide , but especially so in China where high PM concentrations affect huge populations. Atmospheric processes and emission sources cause spatial and temporal variations in PM concentration and chemical composition , but their influence on the toxicological characteristics of PM are still inadequately understood. In this study , we report an extensive chemical and toxicological characterization of size-segregated urban air inhalable PM collected in August and October 2013 from Nanjing , and assess the effects of atmospheric processes and likely emission sources. A549 human alveolar epithelial cells were exposed to day- and nighttime PM samples ( 25 , 75 , 150 , 200 , 300 Î¼g/ml) followed by analyses of cytotoxicity , genotoxicity , cell cycle , and inflammatory response.
