 Action-planning and execution deficits in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy ( HCP) are potentially due to deficits in the integration of sensory information , such as vision , with motor output. To determine differences in anticipatory visual patterns in children with HCP compared to typically developing ( TD) children , and to assess visuomotor coordination in children with HCP. We included 13 children with HCP ( Age = 6.8 + 2.9 yrs) and 15 TD children ( Age = 5.8 + 1.1 yrs). The experimental task used in this study is a valid action-planning task , which consisted of initially reaching and grasping an object placed at a fixed position , followed by placing the object in a random target position. Visual patterns were recorded using a head-mounted eye-tracker system and arm movements were recorded using motion capture ( 120 Hz). Children with HCP had delayed anticipatory gaze time and longer latency than TD children during the planning and execution phases. Children with HCP also had a higher frequency of gaze shifts , longer reaction times ( RT) and movement times ( MT) than TD children. Children with HCP may have deficits in anticipatory vision , which potentially affected planning and executing a goal-directed action. Therapeutic interventions focusing on improving visuomotor coordination may improve the motor performance in children with HCP.
