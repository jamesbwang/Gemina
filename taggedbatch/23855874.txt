 People with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> often have limited avenues for social support. Social isolation often develops as their abilities to engage in daily social and vocational activities decrease. With recent advancements in technology and increasing use of social media , virtual platforms such as blogging may provide opportunities for social support. This study analyzed published blog posts of people with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> to investigate how social support occurs through blogging for chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> blog users and the nature of such online interactions. A total of 810 blog posts published from January 2014 to December 2015 on 44 publicly accessible chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> blogs were collected and analyzed through qualitative phenomenological thematic analysis. The Virtual Online Support Sequence ( VOSS) was identified through the exchange of online comments; this sequence defines the process by which virtual social support can be established through the process of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> blogging. Three subthemes were also identified in relation to social support in the online blogging environment: ( a) the virtual community of pain blogging; ( b) establishing social support through the VOSS; and ( c) recounting everyday experiences related to pain. These findings suggest that blogging can be useful in seeking , receiving and providing social support for people with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Understanding this mechanism behind establishing virtual social support may potentially encourage people with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> to pursue additional support online if they have limited face-to-face opportunities.
