 Cells of E.<pathogen> coli isolates from the gut of healthy volunteers ( N = 5) and patients with Crohn 's disease ( N = 5) and laboratory E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strain DH5Î± bound mucin in vitro in similar amounts ranging from 0.02 to 0.12 mg/mg of bacterial dry<symptom> weight. Binding was evaluated by the decrease in optical absorption of mucin solution at 214 nm after incubation with bacteria. Detailed analysis of mucin binding by one of isolates showed that during incubation of 0.09 mg/ml bacteria in 0.15 M NaCl containing 0.1 mg/ml mucin at 25
