 MicroRNA ( miRNA) misregulation in peripheral blood has been linked to Parkinson disease ( PD) but its role in the disease progression remains elusive. We performed an explorative genome-wide study of miRNA expression levels in dopaminergic neurons ( DAn) from PD patients generated by somatic cell reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cells differentiation. We quantified expression levels of 377 miRNAs in DAn from 3 sporadic PD patients ( sPD) , 3 leucine-rich repeat kinase 2-associated PD patients ( L2PD) ( total 6 PD) , and 4 healthy controls. We identified differential expression of 10 miRNA of which 5 were upregulated in PD ( miR-9-5p , miR-135a-5p , miR-135b-5p , miR-449a , and miR-449b-5p) and 5 downregulated ( miR-141-3p , miR-199a-5p , miR-299-5p , miR-518e-3p , and miR-519a-3p). Changes were similar in sPD and L2PD. Integrative analysis revealed significant correlations between miRNA/mRNA expression. Moreover , upregulation of miR-9-5p and miR-135b-5p was associated with downregulation of transcription factors related to the DNA hypermethylation of enhancer elements in PD DAn ( FOXA1 and NR3C1). In summary , miRNA changes are associated with monogenic L2PD and sPD and co-occur with epigenetic changes in DAn from PD patients.
