 To observe the role of apelin in the prevention of pulmonary hypertension induced by hypoxia in mice. Adult male apoE gene knockout ( apoE-KO) mice were exposed to isobaric hypoxic chamber ( 9 % ~ 11 % O â‘  The right ventricular systolic pressure ( RVSP) and the weight ratio of right ventricle ( RV) to left ventricle plus septum ( LV+S) of hypoxia group were significantly higher than those of normoxia group by 87 % and 85 % ( Apelin attenuates hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension of mice through regulation of lipid metabolism.
