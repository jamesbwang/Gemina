 Adjuvant whole breast radiation therapy has developed into the standard of care for patients following a lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer. However , there is recent interest in intraoperative radiation therapy ( IORT) to minimize toxicity while still improving local control beyond surgical resection and anti-estrogen therapy alone. All patients were evaluated pre-operatively in a multidisciplinary clinic setting at a community hospital for suitability for breast conservation therapy. A total of 109 patients were reviewed receiving 110 IORT treatments. Patients were followed with clinical breast examinations and mammography as clinically indicated. At a median follow-up of 29.9 months , 2/110 ( 1.8 %) patients experienced a local failure. One patient ( 0.9 %) experienced a regional failure. Local control , disease-free survival and overall survival at 3 years were 98.9 % ( 95 % CI 92.2-99.8) , 97.2 % ( 95 % CI 88.9-99.3) , and 96.0 % ( 95 % CI 84.9-99.0) , respectively. Five-year local control , disease-free survival , and overall survival rates were 96.3 % ( 95 % CI 84.7-99.2) , 94.6 % ( 95 % CI 83.2-98.3) , and 92.5 % ( 95 % CI 80.4-97.3) , respectively. Patient self-reported cosmetic outcome was available for 51 patients , with all patients reporting being either very pleased , pleased , or satisfied with their cosmetic outcome , and no patients reported being dissatisfied or worse. The results of our series suggest the feasibility of utilizing IORT in a community-based cancer center with a high degree of local control , and patient satisfaction with regard to cosmesis. While the results of this series suggest that IORT may be a promising modality , longer follow-up is warranted to better understand exactly which clinicopathological features can predict long-term locoregional disease control.
