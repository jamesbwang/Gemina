 Paraoxonases are a group of different forms enzymes that consist of three non-similar isoforms , The studied population included three hundred patients with coronary artery disease with dyslipidemia who were prescribed statins. Total lipid profile was measured in these patients both before and after approximately 6 months of treatment. Q192R polymorphism of There were no significant differences in baseline lipid levels according to different genotypes in all studied casesof Q192R ( rs662) polymorphism. HDL-C goals were attained less often in patients with RR homozygosity than in Q allele carriers. Analysis by univariate logistic regression confirmed that QQ/QR carriers had an increased chance of attaining HDL-C goals. This study shows that the Q192R polymorphism of
