 Glycogen synthase kinase-3β ( GSK3β) has been reported for its impact on multitude biological processes from cell proliferation to apoptosis. The increase in the ratio of active/inactive GSK3β is the major factor associated in the etiology of several psychiatric diseases , diabetes , muscle hypertrophy , neurodegenerative diseases , and some cancers. These findings made GSK3β a promising therapeutic target , and the interest in the discovery , synthesis of novel drugs to effectively attenuate its function with probably no side effects has been increasing in the chronology of GSK3β drug discovery. In the present study , we applied a combination of computational tools on a chemical library for the virtual discovery of their potency to inhibit GSK3β. The chemical library was screened against a set of filters at different levels. Finally , five compounds in the chemical library were found to potentially inhibit GSK3β with no toxic effects. Furthermore , binding mode analysis revealed that all the compounds bound to the ATP site and most of the hydrogen bonding interactions are conserved as in GSK3β structures deposited in PDB.
