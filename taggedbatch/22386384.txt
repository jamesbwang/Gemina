 We describe the case of a 74-year-old man with a thoracic aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> with a bovine arch who underwent fenestrated endovascular repair of aortic arch aneurysm<disease> using the Najuta stent graft ( Kawasumi Laboratories , Inc , Tokyo , Japan). He has had a previous endovascular aneurysm<disease> repair and femoropopliteal bypass for abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> combined with peripheral arterial disease. The Najuta stent graft was inserted and deployed at zone 0 with delicate positional adjustment of the fenestration of the stent graft to the brachiocephalic trunk. There was no endoleak or complication. His postoperative course was uneventful. At 7-month follow-up , complete exclusion of the aneurysm<disease> was noted. The Najuta stent graft repair of aortic arch aneurysms<disease> is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with a bovine arch.
