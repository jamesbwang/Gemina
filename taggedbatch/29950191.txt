 To describe the 5-year findings after a policy to screen for , diagnose , and isolate medical center employees with adenoviral conjunctivitis<disease><symptom> was implemented. Observational report with a retrospective evaluation of a current quality improvement initiative. Johns Hopkins Medicine , Baltimore , Maryland.ParticipantsJohns Hopkins Medicine employees. Data were retrieved from records maintained for this initiative , in which employees with suspected adenoviral conjunctivitis<disease><symptom> were evaluated in the Occupational Health Clinic and swabbed for polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) testing for adenoviral conjunctivitis<disease><symptom>. Signs , symptoms , work area , diagnoses , and disposition of employees with eye complaints as well as PCR result and adenoviral type were recorded. Five-year data were reviewed. From 2011 to 2016 , of 10,000 full-time equivalent employees , 1,059 employees visited the Occupational Health Clinic with suspicion of adenoviral conjunctivitis<disease><symptom>. Of these , 104 ( 10 %) were PCR positive for adenovirus<pathogen>. Of these PCR-positive employees , 26 ( 25 %) had the worst clinical presentation , epidemic keratoconjunctivitis ( EKC). The Outpatient Pharmacy had the highest number of adenoviral conjunctivitis<disease><symptom> cases ( n = 9). The proportion of red-eye employees having PCR-positive adenoviral conjunctivitis<disease><symptom> increased over 5 years ( P < .005 , Cochrane-Armitage test for trend) as did the proportion of employees with EKC ( P < .05). The proportion of employees with EKC caused by type 37 also increased ( P < .05). Adenoviral conjunctivitis<disease><symptom> represents 10 % of employee cases clinically suspected of this infection. Employees in patient-care areas should be screened even if they have no direct patient contact. Despite increases in the proportions of adenoviral conjunctivitis<disease><symptom> and of EKC over 5 years , no outbreaks occurred. This policy helps identify incipient EKC outbreaks and guides infection control efforts.
