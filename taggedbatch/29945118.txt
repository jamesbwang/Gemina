 Strain within nanomaterials plays a crucial role in defining their physical and chemical properties. Geometrical phase analysis ( GPA) was widely used to investigate deformation within nanomaterials. The traditional GPA method using geometric phases of two lattice fringes provides two-dimensional strain mapping , which is inapplicable to nanomaterials viewed along high-index zone axis. Herein using silicon nanoplate embedded in Si
