 Consensus is lacking regarding optimal surgical treatment of recurrent lumbar disk herniation. A systematic search of multiple databases was conducted for studies evaluating outcomes after treatment for recurrent lumbar disk herniation. Treatment options included decompression surgeries and fusion surgeries. Although fusion surgeries eliminated re-recurrence of disk herniation , this coincided with higher incidences of complications and reoperation. Decompression surgeries and fusion surgeries both resulted in improvements in Japanese Orthopaedic Association , Oswestry Disability Index , and visual analog scale back and leg scores postoperatively ( P < .05). The complication risk profiles of decompression surgeries and fusion surgeries must be balanced with the risk of disk herniation re-recurrence , as both procedures lead to improvements in functional outcomes.
