 To detect the serum levels of platelet microparticle ( PMP) , fibronectin ( FN) , and von Willebrand Factor ( vWF) in acute leukemia<disease> ( AL) patients with thrombocytopenic and to analyze the relationship of the serum levels of PMP , FN and vWF with bleeding degree. One hundred and one newly diagnosed AL patients from May 2014 to May 2017 were enrolled the AL group. According to the WHO standard of bleeding stratification , 101 AL patients were divided into 5 sub groups: 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 score groups; 52 normal persons subjected to physical examination were enrolled in control group. The PMP level was detected by flow cytometry; the FN and vWF levels were detected by ELISA. The levels of PMP , FN and vWF were compared between the AL group and the control group. The serum levels of PMP , FN and vWF were compared according to bleeding degree group. The relationship of bleeding degree with the serum levels of PMP , FN and vWF was analyzed. The patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia<disease> aged 18 to 60 , and accounted for 61.39 %. The degree of bleeding was mainly 1 score , which accounted for 38.61 %. The serum levels of PMP , vWF and FN AL groups were significantly higher than those in control group ( 6.06 % ± 4.38 % vs 0.89 % ± 0.50 % , 205.82 ± 24.89 vs 58.04 ± 13.35 µg/L , 398.29 ± 46.93 vs 311.37 ± 26.02 µg/L) ( P < 0.001). The serum levels of PMP , FN and vWF were different among 5 subgroup ( P < 0.01); the level of PMP and FN were the highest in 0 score group and the lowest in 4 score group; the vWF level was the highest in 4 score groups and the lowest in 0 score group. The bleeding degree in the patients with acute leukemia<disease> negatively correlated with PMP level , and positively with NF and vWF levels ( r = -0.753 , r = 0.648 , r = 0.805). According to the relationship of the bleeding degree with serum levels of PMP , FN , vWF in patients , the detection of PMP , vWF and FN levels can help to evaluale the bleeding degree in the patients.
