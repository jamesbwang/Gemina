 In most animals , the brain makes behavioral decisions that are transmitted by descending neurons to the nerve cord circuitry that produces behaviors. In insects , only a few descending neurons have been associated with specific behaviors. To explore how descending neurons control an insect 's movements , we developed a novel method to systematically assay the behavioral effects of activating individual neurons on freely behaving terrestrial
