 The aim of the study was to describe oral health problems and planned measures in older people receiving nursing care. Poor<symptom> oral health conditions have a negative impact on the quality of life of older people. Therefore , oral care is an important task in daily nursing activities. Data were obtained from the web-based Swedish national quality register Senior Alert. Data regarding oral health status and planned measures in individuals ≥ 65 years from one county in Sweden between July 2014 and June 2015 were included. The Revised Oral Assessment Guide- the Jönköping ( ROAG-J) , was used routinely by nursing staff in nursing care facilities to measure oral health status. Oral assessments were made on 2567 individuals ( 65.7 % women). The most common oral health problem was related to `` Teeth '' ( 43.0 %) , which indicates deficient oral hygiene and/or broken teeth. At least one measure was planned in all the participants. The most common planned measures were `` Moistening of the mouth<symptom> '' ( 16.6 %) , followed by `` Brushing- assistance or complete help '' ( 13.5 %). Oral health problems were common , and planned measures did not seem to be sufficient to address the identified problems. The results indicate that greater priority should be given to the oral health care of older people in nursing care. The study highlights the importance of not only identifying oral health problems but also having knowledge and strategies for oral health care. Collaboration is needed to support nurses in caring for the oral health care of older people in nursing homes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
