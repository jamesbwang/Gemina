 We examined factors related to conditions of life function and falls , including eye movements<symptom> and gait variability , in community-dwelling older adults in Japan. Participants were 82 older adults ( 21 men , 61 women , mean age 76.1 years). We measured eye movements<symptom> and gait variability during walking , and cognitive , attentional and life function. We compared two groups according to their fall history , and used a multiple logistic regression analysis to determine its relevance. Fixation time , which was estimated from eye movements<symptom> during obstacle crossing , and gait variability ( vertical) were significantly associated with falls. There was also a significant correlation between fixation time and gait variability during obstacle crossing. In other words , the higher the gait variability in older adults , the higher the risk of falls , which was due to reduced attention estimated from eye movements<symptom> during obstacle crossing that required obstacle avoidance. These results show that poor attention during gait is a critical risk factor for falls in community-dwelling older adults. For fall prevention , it is necessary to promote exercises for attention , and to maintain an older adult-friendly pedestrian environment. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; • •: • •- • •.
