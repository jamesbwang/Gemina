 To evaluate the reliability of the parameters for acetabular/femoral pathomorphologies in L-spine and hip radiographs compared to pelvic radiographs. A retrospective review of L-spine , hip , and pelvic radiographs from 101 patients was performed. Three radiologists independently measured five parameters ( acetabular roof angle of Tönnis ( Tönnis angle) , center-edge-angle of Wiberg ( CEA) , femoral head extrusion index ( FHEI) , cross-over sign , pistol-grip deformity) in each radiograph. No significant differences were identified ( p ≥ 0.07) except Tönnis angles and FHEIs from the L-spine radiographs. Inter-radiograph/inter-reader ICCs were excellent or good. Pathomorphology-related measurements in L-spine radiographs can also be used as alternatives to those in pelvic or hip radiographs. If L-spine radiographs are already available , additional pelvic or hip radiographs may be unnecessary , thus reducing patients ' overall radiation exposure.
