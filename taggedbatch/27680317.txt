 Meaningful resident engagement in quality improvement ( QI) remains challenging. Barriers include a lack of time and of faculty with QI expertise. We leveraged our internal medicine ( IM) residency program 's adoption of an `` X '' ( inpatient rotations) plus `` Y '' ( ambulatory block) schedule to implement a QI curriculum for all residents during their ambulatory block. We sought to engage residents in interprofessional QI , improve residents ' QI confidence and knowledge and application to practice , and create opportunities for QI scholarship. In July 2015 , the program provided dedicated time for QI in the ambulatory block. All categorical IM residents and 11 voluntary faculty mentors were divided into 10 teams based on clinic site and `` Y '' block schedule. Teams participated in resident-led , interprofessional ambulatory QI projects. Resident QI knowledge and confidence were assessed before the curriculum and 11 months after using the Quality Improvement Knowledge Application Tool-Revised ( QIKAT-R) and surveys. QI project implementation and scholarship were tracked. All categorical residents ( N = 81) participated. Residents reported increased confidence in all QI skills , and they demonstrated increased knowledge , with mean QIKAT-R paired scores improving from 15.8 ± 4.6 to 19.1 ± 5.9 ( n = 45 pairs , This ongoing curriculum engaged IM and IM-psychiatry residents in QI during their ambulatory block using volunteer clinic faculty mentors. Residents demonstrated improved QI confidence and knowledge. The majority of resident projects were sustained and generated scholarship.
