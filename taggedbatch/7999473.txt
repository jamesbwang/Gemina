 Asians are diagnosed with breast cancer at a younger age than Caucasians are. We studied the effect of age on locoregional recurrence and the survival of Asian breast cancer patients treated with breast-conserving therapy. Medical records of 2492 patients treated with breast-conserving therapy between 1989 and 2012 were reviewed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate locoregional recurrence , breast cancer-free survival , and breast cancer-specific survival rates. These rates were then compared using log-rank tests. Outcomes and age were modeled by Cox proportional hazards. Fractional polynomials were then used to test for non-linear relationships between age and outcomes. Patients â‰¤ 40 years old were more likely to have locoregional recurrence than were older patients ( Hazard ratio ( HR) = 2.32 , P < 0.001). Locoregional recurrence rates decreased year-on-year by 4 % for patients with luminal-type breast cancers , compared with 8 % for those with triple-negative cancers. Similarly , breast cancer-free survival rates increased year-on-year by 4 % versus 8 % for luminal-type and triple-negative cancers , respectively. Breast cancer-specific survival rates increased with age by 5 % year-on-year. Both breast cancer-free survival and breast cancer-specific survival rates in patients with luminal cancers exhibited a non-linear ( `` L-shaped '') relationship-where decreasing age at presentation was associated with escalating risks of relapse and death. The influence of age on overall survival was confounded by competing non-cancer deaths in older women , resulting in a `` U-shaped '' relationship. Young Asian breast cancer patients have a continuous year-on-year increase in rates of disease relapse and cancer deaths compared with older patients with no apparent threshold.
