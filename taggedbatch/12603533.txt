 Clear cell sarcoma<disease> ( CCS) , a deep-rooted tumor with a predilection for lower extremities , has a proclivity to involve the tendons and aponeuroses. This sarcoma<disease> is seen predominantly around the foot and ankle region. Diagnosis is mainly finalized using histological and immunohistochemical assessment. The main treatment strategy is surgery followed by chemotherapy. An erratic challenge is posed by histological similarity and immunohistochemical overlap to the diagnosis and distinguishing of clear cell sarcoma<disease> from primary or metastatic malignant melanoma ( MM) which is more common. Here , we described a CCS case located in the left leg of a 37-year-old male patient.
