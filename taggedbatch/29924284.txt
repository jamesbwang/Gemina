 Inequalities in terms of access and quality of healthcare persist , especially among Andean populations , such as the community of Chopcca. Here , we describe the perception of healthcare provided in medical facilities as well as the practices linked to health care in residents of settlements in the Huancavelica region. We carried out a cross-sectional study by means of a structured questionnaire administered to 775 residents of urban and rural towns of the Yauli and Paucar√° districts. 68.7 % refer always using medicinal plants to cure themselves; 86.7 % never made a `` payment '' to Mother Earth; 81.4 % has not practiced coca qaway or sara qaway. 88.5 % of respondents visit the medical facility when they fall ill. 57.4 % refer that the healthcare staff always transmits confidence and security , this proportion is higher in rural vs. urban areas ( 64.6 % versus 28.8 %). The communities under study demand the healthcare services offered by the formal system; nevertheless , traditional cultural practices persist , being the most important one the use of medicinal plants.
