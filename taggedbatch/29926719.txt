 Techniques for rapidly measuring both the strength and mode of enzyme inhibitors are crucial to lead generation and optimization in drug development. Isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC) is emerging as a powerful tool for measuring enzyme kinetics with distinct advantages over traditional techniques. ITC measures heat flow , a feature of nearly all chemical reactions , and gives an instantaneous readout of enzyme velocity , eliminating the need for artificial substrates or postreaction processing. In principle , ITC is an ideal method for characterizing enzyme inhibition. However , existing ITC experiments are not well-suited to rapid throughput and few studies to date have employed this approach. We have developed a new ITC experiment , in which substrate and inhibitor are premixed in the injection syringe , that yields complete kinetic characterization of an enzyme inhibitor in an hour or less. This corresponds to savings in time and material of 5-fold or greater compared to previous ITC methods. We validated the approach using the trypsin inhibitor benzamidine as a model system , recapitulating both its competitive inhibition mode and binding constant. Our approach combines the rapid throughput of optimized spectroscopic assays with the universality and precision of ITC-based methods , providing substantially improved inhibitor characterization for biochemistry and drug development applications.
