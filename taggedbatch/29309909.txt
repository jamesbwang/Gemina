 Tumor metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in cancer patients. Migratory breast cancer cells in lymphatic and blood vessels seek new sites and form metastatic colonies in the lung and bone , and then these cancer cells often wreak considerable havoc. With advances in nanotechnology , nanomaterials and nanotechnologies are widely applied in tumor therapy. In this paper , small size fullerenol nanoparticles , which are separated by isoelectric focusing electrophoresis ( IFE) for discrepancy of isoelectric point ( pI) , are used in the study of tumor metastasis. In this study , the commendable inhibition of tumor metastasis was uncovered by intravenous injection of purified fullerenol fraction with special surface charge and functional groups , which was separated by IFE for discrepancy of pI. By investigating the actin dynamics in several cancer cell lines , we found these small size fullerenol nanoparticles disturbed actin dynamics. Young 's modulus detection and cell migration assays revealed that fullerenol lowered stiffness and restrained migration of breast cancer cells. Filopodia , the main supporting structures of actin bundles , are important for cell motility and adhesion. Scanning electron microscopy showed that fullerenol reduced the number and length of filopodia. Simultaneously , the inhibition of integrin to form clusters on filopodias , which was likely induced by reorganizing of actin cytoskeleton , impacted cancer cell adhesion and motility. With intravenous injection of these fullerenol nanoparticles , tumor metastasis is well inhibited in vivo. The underlying mechanism most likely to be attributed to the effect of fullerenol nanoparticles on disturbing actin dynamics. With the disordered actin fiber , cell function is varied , including decreased cell stiffness , reduced filopodia formation , and inactivated integrin.
