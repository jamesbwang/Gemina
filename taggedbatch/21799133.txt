 High-intensity interval training ( HIIT) has been proposed as a time-efficient exercise format to improve exercise adherence , thereby targeting the chronic<disease> disease<disease> burden associated with sedentary behaviour. Exercise mode ( cycling , running) , if self-selected , will likely affect the physiological and enjoyment responses to HIIT in sedentary individuals. Differences in physiological and enjoyment responses , associated with the mode of exercise , could potentially influence the uptake and continued adherence to HIIT. It was hypothesised that in young sedentary men , local and systemic oxygen utilisation and enjoyment would be higher during a session of running HIIT , compared to a session of cycling HIIT. A total of 12 sedentary men ( mean ± SD; age 24 ± 3 years) completed three exercise sessions: a maximal incremental exercise test on a treadmill ( MAX) followed by two experiment conditions , ( 1) free-paced cycling HIIT on a bicycle ergometer ( HIITCYC) and ( 2) constant-paced running HIIT on a treadmill ergometer ( HIITRUN). Deoxygenated haemoglobin ( HHb) in the gastrocnemius ( GN) , the left vastus lateralis ( LVL) and the right vastus lateralis ( RVL) muscles , oxygen consumption ( VO There was a higher HHb in the LVL ( In sedentary individuals , free-paced cycling HIIT produces higher levels of physiological stress when compared to constant-paced running HIIT. Participants perceived running HIIT to be more enjoyable than cycling HIIT. These findings have implications for selection of mode of HIIT for physical stress , exercise enjoyment and compliance.
