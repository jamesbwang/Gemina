 A growing and ageing haemophilia treatment centre ( HTC) population , as well as a glaring shortage of adult haematologists available for the clinical management of persons with haemophilia ( PWH) , has resulted in significant care gaps in the United States. In response , various advanced practice registered nurse ( APRN)- based models have been adopted across the country to counteract a deficit in haematologist resources for adult PWH. These models in the management of PWH have demonstrated competency and efficiency in the care of patients with haemophilia , offering a viable solution in areas where haematologist resources are limited and assure quality care provision , most notably in rural areas. The available literature indicates equivalence in terms of clinical outcomes , patient satisfaction and elements of healthcare service utilization. With continued support in current clinical guidelines and institutional contributions in the form of residency and fellowship programmes , the robust successes of APRN models for the clinical management of PWH can be maintained and expanded well into the foreseeable future.
