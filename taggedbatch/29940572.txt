 There is evidence that suicidal behavior , among others , is an abnormal response to stress caused by a dysfunction in the activity of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis , and that cortisol levels are low in a considerable number of people attempting suicide. In this study , we aimed to search for associations of plasma cortisol levels with the clinical characteristics of a group of psychiatric suicide attempters. The cortisol was measured in the morning in 200 psychiatric patients hospitalized after a suicide attempt , with diagnoses of major depressive disorder , bipolar disorder , psychosis , and personality/adjustment disorder , and compared to the levels of 138 healthy controls. Comparisons were also made for diagnostic subgroups and across diagnoses , with regard to depressive symptomatology , mode of attempt , suicide intent , number of attempts , and age. Cortisol levels were significantly lower for the whole group of attempters compared to controls. Furthermore , low cortisol levels characterized attempters with personality/adjustment disorder , higher depressive symptomatology , low suicide intent , non-violent attempt mode , repeated attempts , and of younger age. Certain clinical characteristics were identified in attempters with low cortisol levels. In previous studies , low cortisol levels have been associated with impairments in cognitive control , decision-making , and emotional processing that may lead , in the presence of stressors , to suicidal behavior , frequently with non-fatal outcome. Adding plasma cortisol levels to demographic and psychopathological data may help in identifying a subpopulation of attempters with neurocognitive deficits linked to dysfunction of Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal-axis activity , with implications for treatment.
