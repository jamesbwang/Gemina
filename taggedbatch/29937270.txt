 Polyethylene remains the most popular bearing material for total knee arthroplasty ( TKA). Despite its widespread use , wear continue to be one of major factors implicated in revision surgery. Sliding distance , cross-shear , and contact stress are the major factors influencing polyethylene wear. As previous studies have either relied on wear simulations , computational modeling , or in vitro measurements to quantify sliding distance and cross-shear , in vivo subject-specific sliding distance and cross-shear after bi-cruciate retaining ( BCR) TKA has not been previously reported. The objective of this study was to quantify the 6 Â°- of-freedom ( 6DOF) in vivo kinematics , sliding distance , and cross-shear in BCR TKA patients during gait. Twenty-nine unilateral BCR TKA patients performed level walking on a treadmill under dual fluoroscopic imaging system ( DFIS) surveillance. Cumulative normalized sliding distances between the lateral and medial compartments did not change significantly ( p > 0.05) during the gait cycle. Although the total normalized sliding distance was similar between the lateral and medial compartments , the cross-shear at the lateral compartment differed significantly from that at the medial compartment ( p < 0.001). Significant differences in the relative length positions of the peak sliding distance and cross-shear were found between the lateral and medial bearing components. The flexion-extension motion of the reconstructed knee was more associated with the linear displacements ( anterior-posterior , R
