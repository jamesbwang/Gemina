 A facile and practical ( Cp * RhCl2) 2-catalyzed three-component reaction between indolyl aldehydes , amines and alkynes involving C-H activation and cyclization has been developed. A series of β-carbolinium salts and γ-carbolinium salts are successfully afforded in good to quantitative yields under mild conditions. This efficient and convergent strategy provides a good choice for constructing the libraries of β-carbolinium salts and γ-carbolinium salts.
