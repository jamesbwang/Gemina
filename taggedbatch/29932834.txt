 People living with long-term conditions are increasingly being cared for in care homes. Prognostication in this population is particularly challenging , and outcomes are often uncertain. This case history highlights some of the difficulties encountered when clinicians give a time-bound prognosis. It also illustrates how education programmes with high facilitation and ongoing support for care home staff can sustain practice development and enable staff to become highly skilled in working with uncertainty. Practice development programmes such as those based on the Six Steps to Success Programme for care homes give care home staff a framework within which to regularly review a resident 's clinical status and the confidence to have the ongoing conversations that empower residents to contribute to decision making and focus on their own goals for care.
