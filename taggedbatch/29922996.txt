 We studied the dynamics of respiratory function in rats during intratracheal poisoning<disease> with diisopropyl fluorophosphate and pentylenetetrazole in doses corresponding to the LD50 in humans. The maximum of external respiration<symptom> impairment<symptom> was recorded in 30 min after poisoning<disease>. Administration of diazepam and atropine both separately and in combination during the development of the first signs of poisoning<disease> did not significantly affect the respiration<symptom> parameters , but reduced the incidence of seizures<symptom> and contributed to a decrease in the rate of animal death. Intratracheal administration of cholinolytic , Î²
