 DNA damage response pathways are essential for genome stability and cell survival. Specifically , the ATR kinase is activated by DNA replication stress. An early event in this activation is the recruitment and phosphorylation of RPA , a single stranded DNA binding complex composed of three subunits , RPA70 , RPA32 and RPA14. We have previously shown that the LIM protein Ajuba associates with RPA , and that depletion of Ajuba leads to potent activation of ATR. In this study , we provide evidence that the Ajuba-RPA interaction occurs through direct protein contact with RPA70 , and that their association is cell cycle-regulated and is reduced upon DNA replication stress. We propose a model in which Ajuba negatively regulates the ATR pathway by directly interacting with RPA70 , thereby preventing inappropriate ATR activation. Our results provide a framework to further our understanding of the mechanism of ATR regulation in human cells in the context of cellular transformation.
