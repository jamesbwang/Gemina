 Risk-taking is associated with increased morbidity and mortality among adolescents , with insufficient sleep a potential factor contributing to heightened risk-taking propensity in this age group. A systematic review of the evidence examining the relationship between sleep duration and risk-taking in adolescents was conducted using PsycINFO , PubMed , Medline , Scopus , and CINAHL databases. These searches identified 26 studies including 579,380 participants , 24 of which were appropriate for meta-analysis. Pooled results indicated that insufficient sleep was associated with 1.43 ( 1.26 , 1.62) times greater odds of risk-taking. This relationship was witnessed across diverse categories of risk-taking , including alcohol use , drug use , smoking , violent/delinquent behaviour , transport risk-taking/road safety , sexual risk-taking and trait risk-taking. Risk of bias analysis showed that the quality of the included studies was mixed. Further , few studies utilized either longitudinal or experimental designs , thus limiting causal conclusions. These findings highlight the importance of further research to examine the causal relationship between sleep duration and risk-taking and to elucidate the mechanisms that underpin this relationship.
