 Peripheral sensory neuropathy is the most prominently reported adverse effect of oxaliplatin. The purpose of this study was to evaluate metformin role in oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy. From November 2014 to May 2016 , 40 patients with stage III colorectal cancer completed 12 cycles of FOLFOX-4 regimen. Twenty patients in the control arm received FOLFOX-4 regimen only , and 20 patients in the metformin arm , received the same regimen along with metformin 500 mg three times daily. The metformin efficacy was evaluated using National Cancer Institute Common<disease> Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI-CTCAE version 4.0) , a12-item neurotoxicity questionnaire ( Ntx-12) from the validated Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group and , the brief pain inventory short form `` worst pain '' item. In addition to neurotensin , malondialdehyde and interleukin-6 serum levels assessment. At the end of the 12th cycle , there were less patients with grade 2 and 3 neuropathy in metformin arm as compared to control arm. ( 60 versus 95 % , P = 0.009) In addition , metformin arm showed significantly higher total scores of Ntx-12 questionnaire than control arm ( 24.0 versus 19.2 , P < 0.001). Furthermore , the mean pain score in metformin arm was significantly lower than those of control arm , ( 6.7 versus 7.3 , P = 0.005). Mean serum levels of malondialdehyde and neurotensin were significantly lower in metformin arm after the 6th and the 12th cycles. Metformin may be a promising drug in protecting colorectal cancer patients against oxaliplatin-induced chronic peripheral sensory neuropathy.
