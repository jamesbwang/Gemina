 The monitoring of dialysate ultraviolet ( UV) absorbance is a validated technology to measure hemodialysis adequacy and allows for continuous and real-time tracking every session as opposed to the typical once-monthly assessments. Clinical care guidelines are needed to interpret the findings so as to troubleshoot problematic absorbance patterns and intervene during an individual treatment as needed. When paired with highly structured clinical care protocols that allow autonomous nursing actions , this technology has the potential to improve treatment outcomes. These devices measure the UV absorbance of dialysate solutes to calculate and then display the delivered as well as predicted clearance for that session. Various technical factors can affect the course of dialysate absorbance , confound the device 's readout of clearance results and thus lead to challenges for the dialysis unit staff to properly monitor dialysis adequacy. We analyze optimal and problematic patterns to the device 's ` clearance ' display ( e.g. due to thrombosis of hollow fibers , inadequate access blood flow or recirculation) and provide specific interventions to ensure delivery of an adequate dialysis dose. A rigorous algorithm is presented with representative device monitor display profiles from actual hemodialysis sessions. Procedural rationale and interventions are described for each individual scenario. Real-time hemodialysate UV absorbance patterns can be used for protocol-based intradialytic interventions to optimize solute clearance.
