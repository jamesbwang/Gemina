 Genome duplication is essential for cell proliferation , and the mechanisms regulating its execution are highly conserved. These processes give rise to a spatiotemporal organization of replication initiation across the genome , referred to as the replication program. Despite the identification of such programs in diverse eukaryotic organisms , their biological importance for cellular physiology remains largely unexplored. We address this fundamental question in the context of genome maintenance , taking advantage of the inappropriate origin firing that occurs when fission yeast cells lacking the Rad3/ATR checkpoint kinase are subjected to replication stress. Using this model , we demonstrate that the replication program quantitatively dictates the extent of origin de-regulation and the clustered localization of these events. Furthermore , our results uncover an accumulation of abnormal levels of single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA<pathogen>) and the Rad52 repair protein at de-regulated origins. We show that these loci constitute a defining source of the overall ssDNA<pathogen> and Rad52 hotspots in the genome , generating a signature pattern of instability along the chromosomes. We then induce a genome-wide reprogramming of origin usage and evaluate its consequences in our experimental system. This leads to a complete redistribution of the sites of both inappropriate initiation and associated Rad52 recruitment. We therefore conclude that the organization of genome duplication governs the checkpoint control of origin-associated hotspots of instability and plays an integral role in shaping the landscape of genome maintenance.
