 Wastewater contains significant amounts of nitrogen that can be recovered and valorized as fertilizers and chemicals. This study presents a new membrane electrode coupled with microbial electrolysis that demonstrates very efficient ammonia<pathogen> recovery from synthetic centrate. The process utilizes the electrical potential across electrodes to drive NH
