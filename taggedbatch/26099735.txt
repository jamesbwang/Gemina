 Traditional health information systems are generally devised to support clinical data collection at the point of care. However , as the significance of the modern information economy expands in scope and permeates the healthcare domain , there is an increasing urgency for healthcare organisations to offer information systems that address the expectations of clinicians , researchers and the business intelligence community alike. Amongst other emergent requirements , the principal unmet need might be defined as the 3R principle ( right data , right place , right time) to address deficiencies in organisational data flow while retaining the strict information governance policies that apply within the UK National Health Service ( NHS). Here , we describe our work on creating and deploying a low cost structured and unstructured information retrieval and extraction architecture within King 's College Hospital , the management of governance concerns and the associated use cases and cost saving opportunities that such components present. To date , our CogStack architecture has processed over 300 million lines of clinical data , making it available for internal service improvement projects at King 's College London. On generated data designed to simulate real world clinical text , our de-identification algorithm achieved up to 94 % precision and up to 96 % recall. We describe a toolkit which we feel is of huge value to the UK ( and beyond) healthcare community. It is the only open source , easily deployable solution designed for the UK healthcare environment , in a landscape populated by expensive proprietary systems. Solutions such as these provide a crucial foundation for the genomic revolution in medicine.
