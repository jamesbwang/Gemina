 Real-time monitoring of cellular responses to dynamic changes in their environment or to specific treatments has become central to cell biology. However , when coupled to live-cell imaging , such strategies are difficult to implement with precision and high time resolution , and the simultaneous alteration of multiple parameters is a major challenge. Recently , microfluidics has provided powerful solutions for such analyses , bringing an unprecedented level of control over the conditions and the medium in which cells under microscopic observation are grown. However , such technologies have remained under-exploited , largely as a result of the complexity associated with microfabrication procedures. In this study , we have developed simple but powerful microfluidic devices dedicated to live-cell imaging. These microsystems take advantage of a robust elastomer that is readily available to researchers and that presents excellent bonding properties , in particular to microscopy-grade glass coverslips. Importantly , the chips are easy-to-build without sophisticated equipment , and they are compatible with the integration of complex , customized fluidic networks as well as with the multiplexing of independent assays on a single device. We show that the chips are re-usable , a significant advantage for the popularization of microfluidics in cell biology. Moreover , we demonstrate that they allow for the dynamic , accurate and simultaneous control of multiple parameters of the cellular environment. While they do not possess all the features of the microdevices that are built using complex and costly procedures , the simplicity and versatility of the chips that we have developed make them an attractive alternative for a range of applications. The emergence of such devices , which can be fabricated and used by any laboratory , will provide the possibility for a larger number of research teams to take full advantage of these new methods for investigating cell biology.
