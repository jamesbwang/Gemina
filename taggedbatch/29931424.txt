 Prior exposure to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was shown to increase glial acetate metabolism ( GAM) during subsequent exposure to hypoglycemia in diabetic individuals. However , it remained unclear whether this effect was dependent on the disease state or the antecedent cause of hypoglycemia. We aimed to establish whether exposure to fasting-induced hypoglycemia was sufficient to produce alterations in GAM in non-diabetic individuals. GAM was measured via carbon-13 magnetic resonance spectroscopy during infusion of ( 1- As expected , 72 h of fasting significantly reduced blood glucose levels and resulted in a high frequency of hypoglycemic episodes. Steady-state GAM increased from 53.5 ± 3.7 to 61.9 ± 1.7 % following the 72-h fast ( p = 0.005). This increase correlated with greater duration of hypoglycemia experienced during the fast ( r = 0.967). In addition , subjects with greater GAM at baseline experienced a greater increase in the duration of hypoglycemia experienced during the 72-h fast ( r = 0.979). GAM has potential as a biomarker for susceptibility to hypoglycemic episodes. Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT02690168.
