 Whole genome sequence comparisons have become essential for establishing a robust scheme in bacterial taxonomy. To generalize this genome-based taxonomy , fast , reliable , and cost-effective genome sequencing methodologies are required. MinION , the palm-sized sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies , enables rapid sequencing of bacterial genomes using minimal laboratory resources. Here we tested the ability of Nanopore sequences for the genome-based taxonomy of
