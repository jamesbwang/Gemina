 The demand for minimally invasive cosmetic procedures has continued to rise , especially in Germany , yet few studies have examined this patient population. The literature in Germany has repeatedly voiced the speculation that users of minimally invasive , skin-rejuvenating procedures displayed a higher tendency toward dysmorphic behavior patterns or , respectively , other abnormal personality traits. The aim of this study was to investigate body image , personality traits , quality of life , and socioeconomic parameters in users of botulinum<pathogen> toxin and/or facial fillers. One hundred forty-five females presented for botulinum<pathogen> toxin and/or soft<disease> tissue filler injections completed demographic and standardized psychometric questionnaires such as the World-Health-Organization Quality of Life-Short Form , Big Five Inventory-10 , Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire before treatment. Patients undergoing injectable aesthetic treatments in an urban dermatology practice were women , middle-aged , highly educated , and mostly employed. Furthermore , participants showed higher quality of life , especially health-related quality of life , and a lower body mass index than controls. Concerning personality traits , our participants scored significantly higher on extraversion , agreeableness , openness to experience , and neuroticism. This study helps to better understand the psychosocial factors characterizing this patient population. Patients differ from controls by having a higher level of quality of life. No signs of body dysmorphic patterns or problematic personality traits were found. This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.
