 The purpose of this study was to analyze the respiratory motion of each segment of the liver in patients with or without a history of abdominal surgery using four-dimensional computed tomography. In total , 57 patients treated for abdominal tumors using proton beam therapy were enrolled. Eighteen patients had a history of abdominal surgery and 39 did not. The positions of clearly demarcated , high-density regions in the liver were measured as evaluation points with which to quantify the motion of each liver segment according to the Couinaud classification. In total , 218 evaluation points were analyzed. Comparison of differences in the motion of individual liver segments showed that among patients without a history of surgery , the maximum was 29.0 ( 7.2-42.1) mm in S6 and the minimum was 15.1 ( 10.6-19.3) mm in S4. Among patients with a history of surgery , the maximum was 28.0 ( 9.0-37.4) mm in S7 and the minimum was 6.3 ( 4.1-9.3) mm in S3. The distances and directions of respiratory motion differed for each liver segment , and a history of abdominal surgery reduced the respiratory motion of the liver. It is necessary to selectively use the internal margin setting.
