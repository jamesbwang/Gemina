 The increasing incidence of morbid obesity suggests that the quantity of bariatric surgical procedures will continue to multiply each year , many patients who have experienced massive weight<symptom> loss<symptom> are left with the dissatisfying consequences of loose and redundant skin , resulting in contour irregularities , an aesthetic and functional problem , and profound dissatisfaction with appearance , residual body image dissatisfaction , There is a subsequent increase in the number of patients seeking additional corrective procedures including abdominoplasty which considered as one of the most popular body-contouring procedures. Correcting skin<symptom> excess<symptom> , could improve all the corollaries , including body , and functional problems and gives profound satisfaction with appearance , it has shown to improve both psychological and social aspects of the patients ' lives. Is there a gender difference in seeking body countering after bariatric surgery for weight<symptom> loss<symptom>? A longitudinal observational study includes 209 obese patients with mean age of 31 ± 8.6 years; ( 31 ± 9 , 31 ± 7 years for female and male patients respectively). Gender ratio M/F = 1.94/ 1 , mean BMI 40 ± 9 kg/m2sin ( n = 138 female) and 45 ± 8m2s in ( n = 71 male) patients , and Waist circumference 109 ± 7 cm in female and 118 ± 4 cm in males. Some female ( n = 10 , 7.25 %) patients were seeking abdominoplasty from the third month after the operations were they have lost ( 21 ± 2 kg) of their excess weight , fourteen patients ( 10.14 %) , at 6 months and 27 patients ( 19.56 %) at 12 months , but most of male patients were requesting abdominoplasty ( n = 7 , 09.86 %) at 12 months after the operations. Male patients have shifted their ideal from weight<symptom> loss<symptom> to abdominoplasty after losing ( 50-70) of their excess weight 12 months after the operations. The main motivation of requesting abdominoplasty in female and male patients was physical difficulty because of redundant skin , and a smaller number in both genders were motivated by a friend or by a doctor. The motivation for abdominoplasty in females is parallel to the amount of EWL or waist circumference. Female patients are looking for body countering three months after surgery , while male patients more often than not request body shaping following one year after surgery , the age groups are invert in genders; female patients asking for body contouring in younger age group while male patients in older age group.
