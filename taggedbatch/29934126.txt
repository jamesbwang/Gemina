 This study evaluated the efficacy of a thiourethane ( TU)- modified silane agent in improving properties in filled composites. The TU-silane agent was synthesized by combining 1,3-bis ( 1-isocyanato-1-methylethyl) benzene and 3- ( triethoxysilyl) propyl isocyanate with trimethylol-tris-3-mercaptopropionate ( TMP) , at 1:2 isocyanate: thiol , leaving pendant thiol and alkoxy silane groups. Barium glass fillers ( 1μm average particle size) were functionalized with 5wt % TU-silane in an acidic ethanol solution. Commercially available 3- ( trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate ( MA-silane) and ( 3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane ( SH-silane) , as well as no silane treatment ( NO-silane) , were used as controls. Composites were made with BisGMA-UDMA-TEGDMA ( 5:3:2) , camphorquinone/ethyl -4-dimethylaminobenzoate ( 0.2/ 0.8 wt %) and di-tert-butyl hydroxytoluene ( 0.3 wt %) and 70wt % silanated inorganic fillers. Polymerization stress ( PS) was measured using a cantilever beam apparatus ( Bioman). Methacrylate conversion ( DC) and rate of polymerization ( RP) during photoactivation ( 800mW/cm 2-way ANOVA/Tukey 's test ( α = 5 %). DC , Rp TU-silane oligomers favorably modified conventional dimethacrylate networks with minimal disruption to existing curing chemistry , in filled composites. For the same conversion values , stress reductions of up to 50 % were observed , without compromise to mechanical properties or handling characteristics.
