 Live attenuated influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccines ( LAIVs) are promising tools for the induction of broad protection from influenza<pathogen><disease> due to their ability to stimulate cross-reactive T cells against influenza<pathogen><disease> pathogens. One of the major targets for cytotoxic T-cell immunity is viral nucleoprotein ( NP) , which is relatively conserved among antigenically distant influenza<pathogen><disease> viruses. Nevertheless , a diversity of epitope composition has been found in the NP protein of different lineages of influenza<pathogen><disease> A<pathogen> viruses. The H2N2<pathogen> master donor virus which is currently used as a backbone for the LAIV and donor of the six genomic segments encoding the internal proteins , A/Leningrad/134/ 17/57 ( MDV Len/17) , was isolated 60 years ago. As such , NP-specific T-cell immunity induced upon vaccination with classical LAIVs with a 6:2 genome composition containing this older NP might be suboptimal against currently circulating influenza<pathogen><disease> viruses. In this study , a panel of H3N2<pathogen> LAIV candidates with wild-type NP genes derived from circulating viruses were generated by reverse genetics ( 5:3 genome composition). These viruses displayed the cold adaptation and temperature sensitivity phenotypes of MDV Len/17 in vitro. LAIVs with both 6:2 and 5:3 genome compositions were attenuated and replicated to a similar extent in the upper respiratory<disease><symptom> tract<symptom> of ferrets. LAIVs were immunogenic as high neutralizing and hemagglutination inhibition serum antibody titers were detected 21 days after infection. All vaccinated animals were protected against infection with heterologous H3N2<pathogen> influenza<pathogen><disease> A<pathogen> viruses. Thus , LAIV with a 5:3 genome composition is safe , immunogenic and can induce cross-protective immunity.
