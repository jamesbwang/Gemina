 In a relatively recent reevaluation of the van Deemter Equation , Guiochon concluded that the mass transfer resistance in the mobile phase is independent of the retention factor. In the process he showed reduced plate heights â‰ˆ 2 for a nearly unretained peak ( k = 0.4) in high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC). In the present work , using supercritical fluid chromatography ( SFC) , efficiency was measured at various pressures , densities , and modifier concentrations. The highest efficiency , with a reduce plate height of h
