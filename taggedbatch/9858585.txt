 Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( GSEA) is routinely used to analyze and interpret coordinate pathway-level changes in transcriptomics experiments. For an experiment where less than seven samples per condition are compared , GSEA employs a competitive null hypothesis to test significance. A gene set enrichment score is tested against a null distribution of enrichment scores generated from permuted gene sets , where genes are randomly selected from the input experiment. Looking across a variety of biological conditions , however , genes are not randomly distributed with many showing consistent patterns of up- or down-regulation. As a result , common patterns of positively and negatively enriched gene sets are observed across experiments. Placing a single experiment into the context of a relevant set of background experiments allows us to identify both the common and experiment-specific patterns of gene set enrichment. We compiled a compendium of 442 small molecule transcriptomic experiments and used GSEA to characterize common patterns of positively and negatively enriched gene sets. To identify experiment-specific gene set enrichment , we developed the GSEA-InContext method that accounts for gene expression patterns within a background set of experiments to identify statistically significantly enriched gene sets. We evaluated GSEA-InContext on experiments using small molecules with known targets to show that it successfully prioritizes gene sets that are specific to each experiment , thus providing valuable insights that complement standard GSEA analysis. GSEA-InContext implemented in Python , Supplementary results and the background expression compendium are available at: https://github.com/CostelloLab/GSEA-InContext.
