 Cervical cancer ( CC) is a leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in women; thus , the present study aimed to investigated potential target genes and pathways in patients with CC by utilizing an ensemble method and pathway enrichment analysis. The ensemble method integrated a correlation method ( Pearson 's correlation coefficient ( PCC)) , a causal inference method ( IDA) and a regression method ( least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( Lasso)) using the Borda count election algorithm , forming the PCC , IDA and Lasso ( PIL) method. Subsequently , the PIL method was validated to be a feasible approach to predict microRNA ( miRNA) targets by comparing predicted miRNA targets against those from a confirmed database. Finally , Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis was conducted for target genes in the 1,000 most frequently predicted miRNA-mRNA interactions to determine target pathways. A total of 10 target genes were obtained that were predicted > 5 times , including secreted frizzled-related protein 4 , maternally expressed 3 and NIPA like domain containing 4. Additionally , a total of 17 target pathways were identified , of which cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction ( P = 8.91 Ã— 10
