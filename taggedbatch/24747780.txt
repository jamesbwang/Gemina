 A millstone ( MS) was introduced in the production of large-size few-layer-graphene oxide ( FLGO) via true shear exfoliation in order to minimize fragmentation. The MS was constructed with two glass plates , where the top plate was designed to rotate against the stationary bottom plate , thereby generating true shear force. Mildly oxidized graphite ( MOG) was used for MS exfoliation in order to obtain both good property and high yield. The rpm of rotation ( 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , and 50) , solution concentration ( 0.5 , 1 , and 2 mg/ml) , and number of exfoliation ( 1 , 2 , and 3) were optimized by measuring the UV-vis absorption , and the effect of oxidation time ( 30 , 60 , and 90 min) was studied under the given optimum conditions. Next , the FLGO was isolated by centrifugation and characterized by TEM and AFM. The FLGO obtained was as large as ~ 10 μm in size , which was slightly smaller than the pristine graphite , suggesting a possibility of slight fragmentation. But it was still much larger than the FLGO obtained via sonication ( < 1 μm) , demonstrating successful MS exfoliation.
