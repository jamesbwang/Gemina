 Jump distance per step in bounding exercises from the standing position increases with increasing number of steps. We examined the hypothesis that the joint kinetic variables of the stance leg would also increase accordingly. Eleven male athletes ( sprinters and jumpers) performed bounding exercise , starting from the double-leg standing posture<symptom> , and covered the longest distance possible by performing a series of seven forward alternating single-leg jumps. Kinematic and kinetic data were calculated using the data by a motion capture system and force platforms. Hip extension joint work were decreased at third step ( 1
