 Network characteristics in physical gels composed of solvated block copolymers varying in molecular design are examined here by dynamic rheology and computer simulations. In two triblock copolymer series , one with chain length ( N) varied at constant copolymer composition ( f) and the other with f varied at constant N , we discern the dependence of equilibrium network metrics on both N and f. Increasing the block number in a linear multiblock series at constant N and f escalates conformational complexity , which dominates network connectivity classified according to a midblock conformation index.
