 Vaccinations are important preventative health behaviors. The recently developed Vaccination Attitudes Examination ( VAX) Scale aims to measure the reasons behind refusal/hesitancy regarding vaccinations. The aim of this replication study is to conduct an independent test of the newly developed VAX Scale in the UK. We tested ( a) internal consistency ( Cronbach 's α); ( b) convergent validity by assessing its relationships with beliefs about medication , medical mistrust , and perceived sensitivity to medicines; and ( c) construct validity by testing how well the VAX Scale discriminated between vaccinators and nonvaccinators. A sample of 243 UK adults completed the VAX Scale , the Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire , the Perceived Sensitivity to Medicines Scale , and the Medical Mistrust Index , in addition to demographics of age , gender , education levels , and social deprivation. Participants were asked ( a) whether they received an influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccination in the past year and ( b) if they had a young child , whether they had vaccinated the young child against influenza<pathogen><disease> in the past year. The VAX ( a) demonstrated high internal consistency ( α = .92); ( b) was positively correlated with medical mistrust and beliefs about medicines , and less strongly correlated with perceived sensitivity to medicines; and ( c) successfully differentiated parental influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccinators from nonvaccinators. The VAX demonstrated good internal consistency , convergent validity , and construct validity in an independent UK sample. It appears to be a useful measure to help us understand the health beliefs that promote or deter vaccination behavior.
