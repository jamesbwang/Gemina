 Mechanical stretch may cause myoblasts to either proliferate or undergo apoptosis. Identifying the molecular events that switch the fate of a stretched cell from proliferation to apoptosis is practically important in the field of regenerative medicine. A recent study on vascular smooth muscle cells illustrated that identification of these events may be achieved by addressing the stretch-induced opposite cellular outcomes simultaneously within a single investigation. To define conditions or a model in which both proliferation and apoptosis can be studied at the same time , we exposed in vitro cultured C2C12 myoblasts to a cyclic mechanical stretch regimen of 15 % elongation at a stretching frequency of 1 Hz for 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , or 8 h every day , consecutively , for 3 days. Both proliferation and apoptosis were observed. Moreover , as the duration of the stretch was prolonged , cell proliferation increased until it peaked at the optimal stretching duration. Afterwards , apoptosis gradually prevailed. Therefore , we established a model in which stretch-induced cell proliferation and apoptosis can be studied simultaneously.
