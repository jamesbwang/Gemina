 Dietary fatty acid ( FA) composition may influence metabolism , possibly affecting weight management. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a 5-d diet rich in PUFA v. MUFA. A total of fifteen normal-weight men participated in a randomised cross-over design with two feeding trials ( 3 d lead-in diet , pre-diet visit , 5-d PUFA- or MUFA-rich diet , post-diet visit). The 5-d diets ( 50 % fat) were rich in either PUFA ( 25 % of energy) or MUFA ( 25 % of energy). At pre- and post-diet visits , subjects consumed breakfast and lunch test meals , rich in the FA for that 5-d diet. Indirect calorimetry was used for 4 h after each meal. There were no treatment differences in fasting metabolism acutely or after the 5-d diet. For acute meal responses before diet , RER was higher for PUFA v. MUFA ( 0 · 86 ( sem 0 · 01) v. 0 · 84 ( sem 0 · 01) , P < 0 · 05) , whereas diet-induced thermogenesis ( DIT) was lower for PUFA v. MUFA ( 18 · 91 ( SEM 1 · 46) v. 21 · 46 ( SEM 1 · 34) kJ , P < 0 · 05). After the 5-d diets , the change in RER was different for PUFA v. MUFA ( -0 · 02 ( sem 0 · 01) v. 0 · 00 ( sem 0 · 01) , P < 0 · 05). Similarly , the change in fat oxidation was greater for PUFA v. MUFA ( 0 · 18 ( sem 0 · 07) v. 0 · 04 ( sem 0 · 06) g , P < 0 · 05). In conclusion , acutely , a MUFA-rich meal results in lower RER and greater DIT. However , after a 5-d high-fat diet , the change in metabolic responses was greater in the PUFA diet , showing the metabolic adaptability of a PUFA-rich diet.
