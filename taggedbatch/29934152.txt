 Sweet-tasting proteins may be useful as low-calorie sugar substitutes in foods , beverages , and medicines. Brazzein is an attractive sweetener because of its high sweetness , sugar-like taste , and good stability at high temperature and wide pH ranges. To investigate the bioactivities of brazzein , the antibacterial , antifungal , antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , and anti-allergic activities were determined in vitro. Brazzein showed no antibacterial and antifungal activities , although it showed approximately 45 % or greater similarity to defensin , which has antimicrobial effects , and drosomycin , which is used as an antifungal agent. However , brazzein exhibited strong antioxidant effects , showing ABTS radical scavenging activity ( IC
