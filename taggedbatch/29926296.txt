 Aminocaproic acid ( EACA) availability has recently been decreased whereas tranexamic acid ( TXA) is still available as an antifibrinolytic agent to decrease blood<symptom> loss<symptom> associated with procedures involving cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB) by inhibiting plasmin mediated platelet activation. Given that the clinical inclination is to substitute TXA for EACA , we sought to compare the antifibrinolytic efficacy of the two agents using the clinically accepted molar ratio of EACA: TXA ( 7.9:1) that prevents platelet activation in a viscoelastic based system under a variety of conditions in human plasma; 25-50 % therapeutic concentration ( EACA 32.5-65 µg/ml , TXA 5-10 µg/ml) in the presence of 1500-3000 IU tissue-type plasminogen activator , with 0-50 % dilution of plasma with buffer. In all equipotent concentrations , TXA provided superior antifibrinolytic action compared to EACA. It is hoped that this work will serve as a rationale to further investigate these and other similar agents , especially now in a time of unpredictable unavailability of key medications needed to optimize patient care. It is also our wish that these data assist perfusionists , anesthesiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons with their consideration of using an antifibrinolytic agent when managing complex patients with hypercoagulable states ( e.g. , ventricular assist device explant , infective endocarditis<disease>) undergoing CPB.
