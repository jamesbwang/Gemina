 Despite many innovations , meeting both economic and ecological requirements remains challenging for conventional resource recovery technology. The development of highly selective peptides puts a new competitor on the market. We present an approach to identify peptides for resource recovery using Phage Surface Display. Here , we describe the development of peptides for binding of rare earth element terbium-containing solids and for removal and enrichment of the heavy metal ions of cobalt and nickel out of waste waters and leaching solutions. We identified phage displaying specific peptides with ∼ 100 × enhanced affinity towards terbium-containing solids or ∼ 20 × enhanced affinity towards nickel ( ∼ 3 × cobalt).
