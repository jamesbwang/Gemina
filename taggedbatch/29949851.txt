 Neopterin has been extensively used as a clinical marker of immune activation during inflammation<symptom> in a wide range of conditions and stresses. However , the analysis of neopterin alone neglects the cellular reactions that generate it in response to interferon- & gamma;. Neopterin is the oxidation product of 7,8-dihydroneopterin , which is a potent antioxidant generated by interferon- & gamma;- activated macrophages. 7,8-Dihydroneopterin can protect macrophage cells from a range of oxidants through a scavenging reaction that generates either neopterin or dihydroxanthopterin , depending on the oxidant. Therefore , plasma and urinary neopterin levels are dependent on both macrophage activation to generate 7,8-dihydroneopterin and subsequent oxidation to neopterin. This relationship is clearly shown in studies of exercise and impact-induced injury during intense contact sport. Here , we argue that neopterin and total neopterin , which is the combined value of 7,8-dihydroneopterin and neopterin , could provide a more comprehensive analysis of clinical inflammation<symptom> than neopterin alone.
