 Comparative studies can provide powerful insights into processes that affect population divergence and thereby help to elucidate the mechanisms by which contemporary populations may respond to environmental change. Furthermore , approaches such as genotyping by sequencing ( GBS) provide unprecedented power for resolving genetic differences among species and populations. We therefore used GBS to provide a genomewide perspective on the comparative population structure of two palm genera ,
