 An expanding trend for genetically engineered ( GE) crops is to cultivate varieties in which two or more single trait products have been combined using conventional breeding to produce a stacked trait product that provides a useful grouping of traits. Here , we report results from compositional analysis of several GE stacked trait products from maize and soybean. The results demonstrate that these products are each compositionally equivalent to a relevant non-GE comparator variety , except for predictable shifts in the fatty acid profile in the case of stacked trait products that contain a trait , MON 87705 , that confers a high-oleic-acid phenotype in soybean. In each case , the conclusion on compositional equivalence for the stacked trait product reflects the conclusions obtained for the single trait products. These results provide strong support for conducting a reassessment of those regulatory guidelines that mandate explicit characterization of stacked trait products produced through conventional breeding.
