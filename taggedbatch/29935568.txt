 Based on landmark trials , international guidelines had for years promoted the use of beta-blockers in the setting of non-cardiac surgery. In 2011 , concerns were raised regarding the integrity of some of the landmark trials , as the Dutch Erasmus Medical Center found some of them to be scientifically incorrect. Based on the remaining studies that were to be trusted , investigations showed that , in contrast to prior beliefs , the widespread use of perioperative beta-blockers might be harmful. A call for further investigations into the matter ushered in several observational studies evaluating the safety of perioperative beta-blocker therapy in specific patient subgroups. Within this review , we discuss important aspects for making these decisions , and compare the major observational studies and specific estimates of risk in subgroups of interest. We conclude that patients at high risk with heavy co-morbidities , such as heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , may benefit from beta-blocker therapy , whereas low-risk patients , such as patients with uncomplicated hypertension , may be at increased risk with beta-blocker therapy. We provide a critical review of current perioperative guidelines in view of the new observational data , suggesting that the recommended schematics , such as the Revised Cardiac Risk Index , for risk stratification of patients in this setting may be suboptimal. Further , we provide discussions of other aspects , including risk of sepsis<disease> , type of beta-blocker , and the potential of perioperative beta-blocker withdrawal , which may be important in guiding future studies. Summarising the current evidence , we argue that , after a precarious decade , we may just now , be back on safe ground.
