 Pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis; hence , novel prognostic markers and effective therapeutic targets should be identified. We aimed to evaluate folate receptor alpha ( FR-α) expression in pancreatic cancer and examine its association with clinicopathological features. We utilized tissue samples from 100 primary pancreatic cancer patients who underwent surgery. FR-α was expressed in 37 of 100 cases ( 37 %). The FR-α-positive group ( median , 18.8 months) had a significantly poorer prognosis than the FR-α-negative group ( median 21.3 months; HR 1.89 ( 1.12-3.12); P = 0.017). These groups were not significantly different regarding progression-free survival ( P = 0.196). Furthermore , other serum tumor markers including CA19-9 ( mean , 186 vs. 822 U/ml; P = 0.001) , Dupan-2 ( 286 vs. 1133 U/ml; P = 0.000) , and Span-1 ( 69.7 vs. 171.9 U/ml; P = 0.006) were significantly downregulated in the FR-α-positive group. CA19-9 was another prognostic factor , in addition to FR-α , and patient prognosis showed clear stratification curves with the expression of these two molecules. Along with CA19-9 , FR-α expression was an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival. FR-α and CA19-9 helped predict patient prognosis based on stratification curves.
