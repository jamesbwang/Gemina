 Human gastric cancer is a common malignant neoplasm of the digestive system and represents a threat to human health worldwide. The mechanisms underlying gastric cancer germination and development are not yet fully understood. Circular RNAs ( circRNAs) serve crucial roles in various physiological and pathological processes , particularly cancer. However , few studies have focused on the mechanisms involving circRNAs in gastric cancer. Therefore the present study set out to identify the differentially expressed circRNAs in gastric cancer. Three specimens of gastric cancer and normal gastric tissue were selected and circRNA microarray analysis was performed to detect the differentially expressed circRNAs. The changes in circRNAs were confirmed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. A total of 347 upregulated and 603 downregulated circRNAs ( fold-change , > 2.0) were identified in gastric cancer compared with the normal gastric tissue. A total of 20 selected circRNAs were dysregulated during gastric cancer , which suggests their potential role in gastric cancer. The present study identified circRNAs in the expression profile of human gastric cancer that were potentially involved in the underlying molecular mechanisms of its development.
