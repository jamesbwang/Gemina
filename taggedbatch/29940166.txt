 To assess the safety of a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector expressing REP1 ( rAAV2.REP1) in choroideremia subjects. Design: Phase I clinical trial. Six adult male subjects , 30-42 years of age , with genetically confirmed choroideremia ( CHM) were enrolled. The eye with the worse vision , for all subjects , received a single subfoveal injection of 0.1 mL rAAV2.REP1 containing 10 The primary outcome measure was safety , determined by the number of ocular and systemic adverse events assessed by ophthalmic examination , spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT) , and short-wavelength autofluorescence ( FAF). Secondary outcome measures were the change from baseline in best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA) in the treated eye compared to the untreated eye , changes in visual function using microperimetry , and the area of retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE) preservation by FAF. One subject had an 8-ETDRS-letter BCVA loss from baseline measured at 24 months , while 1 subject had a â‰¥ 15-letter BCVA gain. A similar improvement was noted in the untreated eye of another subject throughout the follow-up period. Microperimetry sensitivity showed no improvement or significant change up to 2 years after vector administration. The area of preserved RPE as measured by FAF was noted to decline at a similar rate between the treated and untreated eyes. One subject experienced a serious adverse event: a localized intraretinal immune response , resulting in marked decline in visual function and loss of SD-OCT outer retinal structures. One serious adverse event was experienced in 6 subjects treated with a subfoveal injection of AAV2.REP1. The area of remaining functional RPE in the treated eye and untreated eye declined at the same rate over a 2-year period. Fundus autofluorescence area is a remarkably predictive biomarker and objective outcome measure for future studies of ocular gene therapy in CHM subjects.
