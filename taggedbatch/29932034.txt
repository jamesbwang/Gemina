 Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM) has been practiced in China for thousands of years. As a complementary and alternative treatment , herbal medicines that are frequently used in the TCM are the most accepted in the Western world. However , animal materials , which are equally important in the TCM practice , are not well-known in other countries. On the other hand , the Chinese doctors had documented the toxic profiles of hundreds of animals and plants thousand years ago. Furthermore , they saw the potential benefits of these materials and used their toxic properties to treat a wide variety of diseases , such as heavy pain and cancer. Since the 50s of the last century , efforts of the Chinese government and societies to modernize TCM have achieved tremendous scientific results in both laboratory and clinic. A number of toxic proteins have been isolated and their functions identified. Although most of the literature was written in Chinese , this review provide a summary , in English , regarding our knowledge of the clinical use of the toxic proteins isolated from a plant , Tian Hua Fen , and an animal , scorpion , both of which are famous toxic prescriptions in TCM.
