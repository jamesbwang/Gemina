 Gout is a systemic<disease> disease<disease> , characterized by the formation and deposition of crystals in tissues ( mainly in and around the joints) of individuals with elevated serum uric acid levels. Lately , a considerable number of reports relating elevated uric acid and/or gout with rhythm disorders , such as atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> , have been published. This review summarizes evidence linking common arrhythmias and hyperuricemia/gout and discusses questions or controversies that surround it. Overall , existing evidence may not be overwhelming , but strongly suggests a positive correlation between uric acid levels and common rhythm disorders. Needless to say that such a link- as a univariate association between the two- is to be expected , given the extensive overlap of risk factors and comorbidities of hyperuricemia/gout and arrhythmias. However , the observed associations seem to persist- in most studies- after extensive adjustment for potential confounders. Still , multivariable analyses of epidemiologically collected data can not substitute for proof coming from basic and clinical studies. There is obviously a need for further basic research to establish a causal relationship between uric acid effects and arrhythmias , as well as translational studies and clinical trials to investigate the therapeutic implications of such a relationship. Simply put , we are fairly certain that there is association , but proof of causation is what we are still in want of.
