 Many areas of research suffer from poor reproducibility , particularly in computationally intensive domains where results rely on a series of complex methodological decisions that are not well captured by traditional publication approaches. Various guidelines have emerged for achieving reproducibility , but implementation of these practices remains difficult due to the challenge of assembling software tools plus associated libraries , connecting tools together into pipelines , and specifying parameters. Here , we discuss a suite of cutting-edge technologies that make computational reproducibility not just possible , but practical in both time and effort. This suite combines three well-tested components-a system for building highly portable packages of bioinformatics software , containerization and virtualization technologies for isolating reusable execution environments for these packages , and workflow systems that automatically orchestrate the composition of these packages for entire pipelines-to achieve an unprecedented level of computational reproducibility. We also provide a practical implementation and five recommendations to help set a typical researcher on the path to performing data analyses reproducibly.
