 The environmental deterioration is in a grave situation , and it is urgent to restore the environment. Biochar is a carbon-rich pyrolysis product of feedstock , which has aroused extensive concern due to its broad application potential for getting rid of pollutants and rehabilitating environment. This review generalizes three aspects on biochar , including production and properties , applications and mechanisms , and its modifications. Firstly , the production and characteristics have been summarized , because the practical applications of biochar are highly related to the special characteristics of biochar. Secondly , this paper outlines the latest applications of biochar for environmental remediation , and further provides a critical review on the application mechanisms in environmental restoration. Thirdly , the modification methods and applications of modified biochar are summarized , and all of the ways can be classified into two types: pretreatment of feedstock and modification of primitive biochar. Furthermore , the possible improvements and outlooks of applying biochar in environmental remediation are proposed. This review provides useful information for the application of biochar in environmental restoration.
