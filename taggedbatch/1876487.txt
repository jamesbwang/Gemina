 Many membrane proteins sense the voltage across the membrane where they are inserted , and their function is affected by voltage changes. The voltage sensor consists of charges or dipoles that move in response to changes in the electric field , and their movement produces an electric current that has been called gating current. In the case of voltage-gated ion channels , the kinetic and steady-state properties of the gating charges provide information of conformational changes between closed states that are not visible when observing ionic currents only. In this
