 Herpes<disease> simplex<pathogen><disease> virus ( HSV) is an important human pathogen with a high worldwide seroprevalence. HSV enters epithelial cells , the primary site of infection , by a low pH pathway. HSV glycoprotein B ( gB) undergoes low pH-induced conformational changes , which are thought to drive membrane fusion. When neutralized back to physiological pH , these changes become reversible. Here , HSV-infected cells were subjected to short pulses of radiolabeling followed by immunoprecipitation with a panel of gB monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs) demonstrating that gB folds and oligomerizes rapidly and co-translationally in the endoplasmic reticulum. Full-length gB from transfected cells underwent low pH-triggered changes in oligomeric conformation in the absence of other viral proteins. MAbs to gB neutralized HSV entry into cells regardless of the pH-dependence of the entry pathway , suggesting a conservation of gB function in distinct fusion mechanisms. The combination of heat and acidic pH triggered irreversible changes in the antigenic conformation of the gB fusion domain while changes in the gB oligomer remained reversible. Elevated temperature alone was not sufficient to induce gB conformational change. Together , these results shed light on the conformation and function of the HSV-1 gB oligomer , which serves as part of the core fusion machinery during viral entry.
