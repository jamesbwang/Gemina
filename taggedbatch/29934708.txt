 Contact with the skin is inevitable or desirable for daily life products such as cosmetics , hair dyes , perfumes , drugs , household products , and industrial and agricultural products. Whereas the majority of these products are harmless , a number can become metabolized and/or activate the immunological defense via innate and adaptive mechanisms resulting in sensitization and allergic contact dermatitis<disease> upon following exposures to the same substance. Therefore , strict safety ( hazard) assessment of actives and ingredients in products and drugs applied to the skin is essential to determine I) whether the chemical is a potential sensitizer and if so II) what is the safe concentration for human exposure to prevent sensitization from occurring. Ex vivo skin is a valuable model for skin penetration studies but due to logistical and viability limitations the development of in vitro alternatives is required. The aim of this review is to give a clear overview of the organotypic in vitro skin models ( reconstructed human epidermis , reconstructed human skin , immune competent skin models incorporating Langerhans Cells and T-cells , skin-on-chip) that are currently commercially available or which are being used in a laboratory research setting for hazard assessment of potential sensitizers and for investigating the mechanisms ( sensitization key events 1-4) related to allergic contact dermatitis<disease>. The limitations of the models , their current applications , and their future potential in replacing animals in allergy-related science are discussed.
