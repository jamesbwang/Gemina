 We measured the prevalence of livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( LA-MRSA) in swine livestock workers , examined LA-MRSA resistance profile and associated carriage with the working activities. Information was collected on demographics and occupational history. Swabs were collected and tested for the isolation of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , examined for antimicrobial susceptibility and all MRSA underwent ST398qPCR assay. LA-MRSA was isolated in 7.3 % of the 396 enrolled workers. LA-MRSA colonization was more likely in farmers than in slaughterhouse workers ( Fisher 's exact p = 0.001). Carriage was associated with herd size , being less frequent in small/medium ( OR = 0.20; 95 % CI = 0.07-0.53) , and with the number of working days per week ( OR = 2.11; 95 % CI = 1.07-4.19). LA-MRSA carriage is strongly animal-exposure related and educational intervention informing about the risks related to the activity with livestock is needed.
