 Objectives To report on the treatment of urethral recurrence after orthotopic urinary diversion at our institution. Methods We retrospectively reviewed clinical information of urethral recurrence in patients who underwent radical cystectomy and orthotopic urinary diversion between January 1998 and January 2013. Results Of 341 patients , 282 presented for follow-up ( median follow-up: 56 months; range: 1-174 months). Eight patients developed local recurrence of urothelial cancer after radical cystectomy. The rate of urethral recurrence ( 1.4 %) in female patients who underwent orthotopic urinary diversion was lower than in male patients ( 3.3 %). The median ( range) time to recurrence was 33 ( 6-120) months after radical cystectomy and orthotopic urinary diversion. Recurrences were treated by transurethral resection of tumour , urethrectomy , neobladder resection , revision of urinary diversion , adjuvant chemotherapy , or radiation therapy , based on individual circumstances. Survival analysis showed that 5-year cancer-specific survival was significantly higher in patients with urethral recurrence alone ( 83.3 %) , compared with patients with other recurrences , including pelvic/abdomen recurrence and distant metastasis ( 26.8 %). Conclusions En bloc urethrectomy and revision of urinary diversion remain the principle surgical choices. Selection of transurethral tumour resection was based on tumour stage and was used in carefully chosen patients. Cancer-specific survival might depend on multidisciplinary therapy.
