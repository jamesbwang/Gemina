 Patients who have successfully acquired the intermittent self-catheterization ( ISC) technique can be expected to use it on a long-term basis. The aim of the present study is to present a validated evaluation scale , referred to as the ICAS ( Intermittent Catheterization Adherence Scale) , which can be used to assess long-term patient adherence to prescribed ISC treatment. The scale was validated in neurologic and non neurologic patients in an experienced French neurourology center , between September 2014 and February 2016. Eight items were chosen , providing a relatively objective insight into the degree to which patients reduce the frequency of their ISC procedures. Various factors , including the patients ' understanding of the procedure , its relevance to their specific condition , as well as their acceptance of its psychological and inherently time-consuming drawbacks , were evaluated. The ISC construct validity and reproducibility , based on internal test-retest consistency and test-retest reliability , were measured using the Intra-class Correlation Coefficient ( ICC). The ICAS was validated in 222 patients ( 133 females , 89 males , mean age 53 Â± 11 years). The patients ' comprehension of the questions was found to be good , and the questionnaire was well accepted. Cronbach 's alpha was 0.73. The ICC test-retest consistency was also found to be good. The ICAS is a simple , acceptable , valid and reproducible test , and in some cases it may facilitate the medical follow-up of ISC patients. In the clinical environment , it is found to be a valuable tool , which can assist medical staff in the prevention of complications related to ISC non-compliance.
