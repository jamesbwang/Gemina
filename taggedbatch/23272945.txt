 Delirium<symptom> not only compromises patient care , but is also associated with poorer outcomes: increased duration of mechanical ventilation , higher mortality , and greater long-term cognitive dysfunction. The PRE-DELIRIC model is a tool used to calculate the risk of the development of delirium<symptom>. The classification of the patients into groups by risk allows efficient initiation of preventive measures. The goal of this study was to validate the PRE-DELIRIC model using the CAM-ICU ( The Confusion<symptom> Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit) method for the diagnosis of delirium<symptom>. Patients admitted to the University Hospital of Vilnius during February 2015 were enrolled. Every day , data were collected for APACHE-II and PRE-DELIRIC scores. Out of 167 patients , 38 ( 23 %) were included and screened using the CAM-ICU method within 24 hours of admission to the ICU. We defined patients as having delirium<symptom> when they had at least one positive CAM-ICU screening or haloperidol administration due to sedation. To validate the PRE-DELIRIC model , we calculated the area under receiver operating characteristic curve. The mean age of the patients was 69.2 ± 17.2 years , 19 ( 50 %) were male , APACHE-II mean score 18.0 ± 7.4 points. Delirium<symptom> was diagnosed in 22 ( 58 %) of 38 patients. Data used for validation of the PRE-DELIRIC model resulted in an area under the curve of 0.713 ( The PRE-DELIRIC model predicted delirium<symptom> in the patients within 24 hours of admission to the ICU. Preventive therapy could be efficiently targeted at high-risk patients if both of the methods are to be implemented.
