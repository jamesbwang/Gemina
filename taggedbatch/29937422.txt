 To characterize functional trajectories in the year before and after a new cancer diagnosis among older adults and to identify risk factors for worsening disability post-diagnosis. We identified 170 participants 70 + years with monthly assessments of thirteen basic , instrumental , and mobility activities and with a new cancer diagnosis from 1998 to 2014. A group-based trajectory model identified distinct functional trajectories based on a total disability score during the twelve months pre- and post-diagnosis. We evaluated associations between potential risk factors at the time of cancer diagnosis and worsening disability post-diagnosis , explored functional transitions from pre- to post-diagnosis and identified participants whose functional trajectories worsened. Three pre-diagnosis functional trajectories were identified among 170 participants ( mean age at diagnosis: 83 years ( range: 73-105 years): mild , moderate , and severe disability. Three post-diagnosis functional trajectories were identified among 158 non-decedents: mild , moderate , and severe disability. Most participants ( 93.9 %) with severe disability pre-diagnosis had severe disability post-diagnosis. Risk factors independently associated with worsening disability post-diagnosis included moderate or severe disability pre-diagnosis ( adjusted risk ratio , aRR: moderate: 2.96; 95 % CI: 2.11-4.16; severe: 5.11; 95 % CI: 3.07-8.52) vs. mild ( reference) , poor physical capability ( aRR: 1.57; 95 % CI: 1.07-2.30) , and incurable stage ( aRR: 1.99; 95 % CI: 1.41-2.80). 40 % of participants with a mild or moderate disability trajectory pre-diagnosis transitioned to a worse functional trajectory post-diagnosis. Older adults followed distinct functional trajectories in the twelve months before and after cancer diagnosis. Functional trajectory pre-diagnosis , poor physical capability , and incurable stage were independent risk factors for worsening disability post-diagnosis.
