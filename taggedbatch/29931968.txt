 The remote controlling of ferroic properties with light is nowadays a hot and highly appealing topic in materials science. Here , we shed light on some of the unresolved issues surrounding light-matter coupling in ferroelectrics. Our findings show that the capacitance and , consequently , its related intrinsic material property , i.e. , the dielectric constant , can be reversibly adjusted through the light power control. High photodielectric performance is exhibited across a wide range of the visible light wavelength because of the wavelength-independence of the phenomenon. We have verified that this counterintuitive behavior can be strongly ascribed to the existence of `` locally free charges '' at domain wall.
