 We report a case of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) with Guillian-Barre syndrome<disease><symptom> ( GBS) as the first symptom. A 30-year-old Chinese female with numbness and inductance of lower extremities 2 months previously. The electromyographic and cerebrospinal fluid findings supported inflammatory demyelinating disease , and the renal biopsy findings and rheumatoid-related results considered systemic lupus erythematosus. The patient received treatment with glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide. Two months after the treatment , the patient 's limb numbness and weakness<symptom> disappeared , and the urinary protein was decreased significantly. Our case highlights the importance of the early diagnosis and treatment of SLE. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multifactorial participant autoimmune systemic<disease> disease<disease> for which the clinical manifestations are complex and diverse.
