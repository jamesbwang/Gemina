 New methods of conservative treatment of female stress urinary continence are needed. We investigated whether superimposed vibration mechanosignals during Kegel exercises could reduce the amount of urinary leakage after four and six weeks of training. Sixty women with stress urinary continence were included in this prospective cohort study. Vibration mechanosignals were superimposed during Kegel exercises using an intravaginal device. Each training session consisted of 15 maximal contractions of pelvic floor muscles for 5 seconds. The women performed training ( five minutes/day) at home for four ( n = 60) and six weeks ( n = 36). Urine leakage ( g) during stress test with standardized bladder volume , and contraction force ( N) without ( F) and with superimposed mechanical stimulations ( VF) were measured at inclusion ( T Mean urine leakage reduced significantly from 20.5 ( Â± 12.2) g at T Superimposed mechanical stimulation with Kegel exercises significantly reduced urinary leakage in women with stress urinary continence.
