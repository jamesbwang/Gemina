 Altitudinal gradients are interesting models to test the effect of biotic and abiotic drivers of floral colour diversity , since an increase in UV irradiance , decrease of pollinator availability and shifts from bee- to fly-pollination in high relative to low altitudes are expected. We tested the effect of altitude and phylogeny , using several chromatic and achromatic colour properties , UV reflectance and pollinators ' discrimination capacity ( Apis mellifera , Bombus terrestris<pathogen> , Musca domestica and Eristalis tenax) , to understand the floral colour diversity in an alpine altitudinal gradient. All colour properties were weakly related to phylogeny. We found a shift from overdispersed floral colours and high chromatic contrast with the background ( for bees) in the low altitude , to clustered floral colours ( UV and green range for bees and flies) and clustered chromatic and achromatic properties in the high altitude. Different from flies , bees could discriminate floral colours in all altitudinal ranges. Low altitudes are likely to exhibit suitable conditions for more plant species , increasing competition for pollinators and floral colour divergence. Conversely , the increase in UV irradiance in high altitudes may filter plants with specific floral UV-reflectance patterns. Overall , floral colour diversity suggests that both biotic ( pollinator fauna) and abiotic ( UV irradiance) drivers shape floral communities , but their importance changes with altitude.
