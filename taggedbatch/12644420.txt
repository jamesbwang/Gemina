 We retrospectively compared the effects of immediate extubation ( IE) in the operating room with those of overnight mechanical ventilation ( MV) after radical transthoracic esophagectomy with 3-field lymphadenectomy in patients with thoracic esophageal cancer. A total of 96 patients were evaluated. 48 patients were extubated in the operating room after surgery ( IE group). The other 48 patients were extubated on the following morning ( MV group). The propensity score-matching method was used to assemble a well-balanced cohort. Clinical and postoperative outcomes were investigated in each group. We also compared postoperative laboratory parameters between groups. The rate of ambulation on postoperative day ( POD) 1 was significantly higher in the IE group compared with that in the MV group ( 50 vs 19 % , respectively , p = 0.003). Moreover , the rate of catecholamine use in the ICU was significantly lower in the IE group compared with that in the MV group ( 15 vs 65 % , respectively , p < 0.001). With regard to postoperative respiratory management , there were no significant differences between groups. The length of ICU stay after esophagectomy was significantly shorter in the IE group compared with that in the MV group ( p = 0.01) , whereas the length of postoperative hospital stay was similar between groups ( p = 0.265). There were also no significant differences in the incidence of postoperative complications. IE in the operating room is not only safe and feasible , even after transthoracic esophagectomy with radical 3-field lymphadenectomy , but also contributes to decrease in catecholamine use , to increase in ambulation on POD 1 and to shorten the ICU stay.
