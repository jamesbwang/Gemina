 The present study assessed the therapeutic efficacy and safety of mirabegron 25 mg in older patients aged ≥ 80 years with overactive bladder and multiple comorbidities. Patients with overactive bladder were prospectively treated with 25 mg of mirabegron once daily. The patients were divided into a younger group ( aged 40-60 years) and an older group ( aged ≥ 80 years) , and their underlying comorbidities were recorded. The primary efficacy end-point was the change in symptom score from baseline to the third month. Safety assessments included adverse events and post-void residual urine volume. A total of 217 patients ( younger , n = 62; older , n = 155) were included. The older patients had more comorbidities than the younger patients. Statistically significant improvements in the Quality of Life index and Patient Perception of Bladder Condition were noted in the younger patients from 1 month after treatment , whereas the International Prostate Symptom Score-Voiding subscore , International Prostate Symptom Score-Total , Quality of Life index , post-void residual urine volume and Patient Perception of Bladder Condition were all significantly decreased in the older patients after 3 months of treatment. The mean changes in the International Prostate Symptom Score-Voiding subscore , maximal flow rate , post-void residual urine volume , nocturia and Urgency Severity Score were significantly different between the two groups. The younger patients experienced more minor adverse events than the older patients ( 41.94 % vs 24.62 %) during treatment. Nevertheless , the adverse event rate was acceptably low in both groups. Mirabegron 25 mg once daily is a safe and effective treatment for older patients with overactive bladder. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; • •: • •- • •.
