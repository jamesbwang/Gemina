 Previous epidemiologic studies have revealed a possible association between microRNA-608 rs4919510 G > C polymorphism and digestive system cancers ( DSCs) risk , but the results were not consistent. We therefore performed an updated meta-analysis to explore the association between microRNA-608 rs4919510 G > C polymorphism and DSCs risk. Crude odds ratios ( ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were calculated to assess the relationship between the microRNA-608 rs4919510 G > C polymorphism and DSCs risk. Heterogeneity , cumulative analyses , sensitivity analyses , and publication bias were also conducted to examine the statistical power. Eight published articles with nine independent case-control studies involving 10,836 individuals were included in this meta-analysis. Overall , no significant association was found between microRNA-608 rs4919510 G > C polymorphism and DSCs risk in general populations. But some significant protective effects were observed in the subgroup of Caucasian population group in three genetic models ( C vs. G: OR = 0.82 , 95 % CI , 0.68-0.99 ,
