 FA ( formaldehyde) and ACR ( acrolein) are common pollutants in environment , which often occur together in air. So , adverse health effects may not only result from their individual toxicity but also from the combined toxicity. While often studied alone , combination effects of these pollutants are inconclusive. Here , we examined the combined cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of FA and ACR on A549 cells based on CCK-8 assay , comet assay , and cytokinesis-block micronuclei assay. FA and ACR mixtures showed significant cytotoxicity and genotoxicity even at NOECs ( no observed effect concentrations). Moreover , FA and ACR administrated jointly at doses from NOECs to sub-cytotoxic concentrations demonstrated significant interactions in cytotoxicity , DNA strand breaks , and chromosome damage. Co-exposure to FA and ACR significantly showed a lower responses on DNA strand break and chromosome damage than those expected for additivity , while an opposite result was obtained on cytotoxicity. Taken together , these results indicated that there was significant interactions on cytotoxicity and genotoxicity for FA and ACR , and prolonged exposure to mixtures of FA and ACR below sub-cytotoxic concentrations can produce a serious threat in human 's health.
