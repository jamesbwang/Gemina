 Several mammalian animal models of traumatic brain injury have been used , mostly rodents. However , reparative mechanisms in mammalian brain are very limited , and newly formed neurons do not survive for long time. The brain of adult zebrafish , a teleost fish widely used as vertebrate model , possesses high regenerative properties after injury due to the presence of numerous stem cells niches. The ventricular lining of the zebrafish dorsal telencephalon is the most studied neuronal stem cell niche because its dorso-lateral zone is considered the equivalent to the hippocampus of mammals which contains one of the two constitutive neurogenic niches of mammals. To mimic TBI , stab wound<disease><symptom> in the dorso-lateral telencephalon of zebrafish was used in studies devoted to fish regenerative properties. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor , which is known to play key roles in the repair process after traumatic brain lesions<symptom> , persists around the lesioned area of injured telencephalon of adult zebrafish. These results are extensively compared to reparative processes in rodent brain. Considering the complete repair of the damaged area in fish , it could be tempting to consider brain-derived neurotrophic factor as a factor contributing to create a permissive environment that enables the establishment of new neuronal population in damaged brain.
