 Anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL) injuries are common in sports including a significant failure rate following reconstruction. The iliotibial band ( ITB) is an important stabilizer of the lateral portion of the knee and also an important lateral rotator of the tibia. Both the tensor fascia lata<pathogen> ( TFL) and gluteus maximus ( Gmax) muscles insert into the ITB proximally. This paper describes a theory that implicates weakened TFL and Gmax muscles as possible contributors to anterolateral rotatory instability. If the TFL and Gmax are important contributors to anterolateral rotatory instability , physical therapists can emphasize assessing for their weakness<symptom> and developing a rehabilitation program to restore their strength.
