 BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to compare the consistency differences between ultrasound and MRI detection methods and the reliability between 2 independent observers. MATERIAL AND METHODS Under 2 kinds of states- the resting state and muscle contractions state- intra-class correlation coefficients ( ICCs) were calculated and the consistency of 2 diagnostic methods was evaluated by 2 independent observers. We also assessed the interscorer reliability of the 2 observers. RESULTS In terms of the evaluation of biological parameters of the pelvic diaphragm , the consistency of the 2 diagnostic methods was moderate. The ICC of pelvic diaphragm area was 0.55 ( 95 % CI 0.35-0.71) , anteroposterior diameter was 0.48 ( 95 % CI 0.28-0.64) , and transverse diameter was 0.43 ( 95 % CI 0.25-0.63). The ultrasound detection values of the perineal ultrasound were significantly smaller than those of the MRI. In addition , these differences were increased with the rise of the pelvic diaphragm area. CONCLUSIONS By evaluating the pelvic diaphragm in patients with pelvic organ prolapse in the resting state , it was preliminarily confirmed that the consistency of ultrasound and MRI was only moderate. The comparison of these 2 diagnostic methods under the dynamic muscle contraction state needs to be further explored.
