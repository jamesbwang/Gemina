 Allergic Asthma is an inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> of the lungs that is characterized by increased infiltration of leukocytes into the airways , limiting the respiratory function. Studies suggest that a defective general regulatory system against inflammation<symptom> could be a significant factor in allergic asthma. It has been shown that Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) have a cellular immunosuppressive therapeutic potential for inflammatory disorders. We investigated whether administration of MSCs during allergen challenge would affect the underlying mechanisms in allergic airways inflammation<symptom>. Fifty mice were used in five control and experimental groups; the experimental mice sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of OVA and aluminum hydroxide emulsion on days 0 , 7 , and 14 , were then challenged intranasally with OVA or sterile PBS on days 14 , 25 , 26 , and 27. Before allergen challenge on day 14 , experimental mice received tail vein injection of MSCs in PBS , whereas control mice received PBS alone. Cytokine and IgE analyses were carried out using lung washes as well as serum samples. Our , results showed that MSCs significantly reduced total cells and eosinophilia and serum OVA-specific IgE concentration in OVA-sensitized and challenged mice. Also , results showed that MSCs markedly inhibited expressions of Th2 and Th17 cytokines and elevated levels of Treg cytokines. we found that administration of MSCs could be used as a potential therapeutic approach for allergic asthma.
