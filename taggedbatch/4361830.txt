 Dietary non-digestible oligosaccharides ( NDOs) have a protective effect against allergic manifestations in children at risk. Dietary intervention with NDOs promotes the colonization of beneficial bacteria in the gut and enhances serum galectin-9 levels in mice and atopic children. Next to this , NDOs also directly affect immune cells and low amounts may reach the blood. We investigated whether pre-incubation of whole blood from peanut-allergic patients with NDOs or galectin-9 can affect basophil degranulation. Heparinized blood samples from 15 peanut-allergic adult patients were pre-incubated with a mixture of short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides ( scGOS/lcFOS) , scFOS/lcFOS , or galectin-9 ( 1 or 5 µg/mL) at 37 °C in the presence of IL-3 ( 0.75 ng/mL). After 2 , 6 , or 24 h , a basophil activation test was performed. Expression of FcεRI on basophils , plasma cytokine , and chemokine concentrations before degranulation were determined after 24 h. Pre-incubation with scGOS/lcFOS , scFOS/lcFOS , or galectin-9 reduced anti-IgE-mediated basophil degranulation. scFOS/lcFOS or 5 µg/mL galectin-9 also decreased peanut-specific basophil degranulation by approximately 20 % , mainly in whole blood from female patients. Inhibitory effects were not related to diminished FcεRI expression on basophils. Galectin-9 was increased in plasma after pre-incubation with scGOS/lcFOS , and both NDOs and 5 µg/mL galectin-9 increased MCP-1 production. The prebiotic mixture scFOS/lcFOS and galectin-9 can contribute to decreased degranulation of basophils
