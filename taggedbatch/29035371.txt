 BACKGROUND Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) have been revealed to function as competing endogenous RNAs ( ceRNAs) , which can seclude the common microRNAs ( miRNAs) and hence prevent the miRNAs from binding to their ancestral gene. Nonetheless , the role of lncRNA-mediated ceRNAs in prostate cancer has not yet been elucidated. MATERIAL AND METHODS Using The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA) database , lncRNA , miRNA , and mRNA profiles from 499 prostate cancer tissues and 52 normal prostate tissues were analyzed with the R package `` DESeq '' to identify the differentially expressed RNAs. GO and KEGG pathway analyses were performed using `` DAVID6 .8 '' and R packages `` Clusterprofile. '' The ceRNA network in prostate cancer was constructed using miRDB , miRTarBase , and TargetScan databases. Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS A total of 376 lncRNAs , 33 miRNAs , and 687 mRNAs were identified as significant factors in tumorigenesis. Based on the hypothesis that the ceRNA network ( lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axis) is involved in prostate cancer and forms competitive interrelations between miRNA and mRNA or lncRNA , we constructed a ceRNA network that included 23 lncRNAs , 6 miRNAs , and 2 mRNAs that were differentially expressed in prostate cancer. Only 3 lncRNAs ( LINC00308 , LINC00355 , and OSTN-AS1) had a significant association with survival ( P < 0.05). The 3 prostate cancer-specific lncRNA were validated in prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 using qRT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated the differential lncRNA expression profiles in prostate cancer , which provides new insights for future studies of the ceRNA network and its regulatory mechanisms in prostate cancer.
