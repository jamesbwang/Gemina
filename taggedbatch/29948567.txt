 Epinephrine may impair splanchnic blood flow , but the impact of epinephrine dose on the occurrence of clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding ( CSGB) caused by stress ulcer<disease><symptom> remains unclear. We investigated the effect of epinephrine dose on the occurrence of stress ulcer-related CSGB in intensive care unit ( ICU) patients. In this prospective , observational , cohort study conducted in a French teaching hospital , 40 consecutive ICU patients receiving epinephrine infusion in whom a stress ulcer<disease><symptom> was diagnosed by an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were included , from February 2010 to July 2015. The effects of epinephrine dose , and other covariates , on the occurrence of stress ulcer-related CSGB were analyzed using a multiple logistic regression model for repeated measures: At each observation , each patient serves as his own control. A total of 1484 time-dependent epinephrine dose modifications were available for analysis. The median epinephrine dose rate was 0.8 ( 0-9.5) mg/h , and the median epinephrine cumulative dose was 44.8 ( 2.6-2343) mg. Epinephrine , expressed as the average dose per day at time t , had a significant protective effect on the occurrence of stress ulcer<disease><symptom> ( odds ratio 0.22; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.12-0.38; p < 0.0001 , for a log10 increase of epinephrine dose). Enteral feeding had also a protective effect ( odds ratio 0.55; 95 % CI 0.41-0.72; p < 0.0001 , for a log10 increase of kcal/day). Only renal replacement therapy increased the occurrence of stress ulcer<disease><symptom> in the model. An increase in the average dose of epinephrine per day increased the time to occurrence of stress ulcer<disease><symptom> in critically ill patients.
