 Polycystic ovary syndrome<disease><symptom> ( PCOS) is an endocrine disorder featured by insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. Testosterone enanthate can induce PCOS in mice models. We investigated the ovary stereological features along with the oxidative stress and inflammatory factors in mice following PCOS induction using testosterone enanthate. Twelve female NMRI mice ( 3 wk old) were divided into 2 groups ( n = 6/each): Control and PCOS. PCOS was induced through daily injections of testosterone enanthate ( 1 mg/100g subcutaneous s.c for 5 wk). Finally , ovaries were studied stereologically. The serum levels of the follicle-stimulating hormone , luteinizing hormone , testosterone , interleukin-6 , and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α were measured using ELISA kit. Serum levels of Malondialdehyde and the antioxidant capacity were measured relatively using thiobarbituric acid and ferric reducing antioxidant power assay. The mean total volume of ovary and the mean volume of cortex ( p < 0.001) , volume of oocyte in the preantral ( p = 0.011) and antral follicle ( p = 0.015) , thickness of zona pellucida ( p = 0.016) , the number of antral follicles ( p = 0.012) , the serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone ( p < 0.001) and the antioxidant capacity ( p = 0.020) reduced significantly in the PCOS group compared to the control. The number of primary ( p = 0.017) and preantral ( p = 0.006) follicles and the serum levels of testosterone ( p < 0.001) , Luteinizing hormone ( p = 0.002) , Malondialdehyde , Interleukin 6 and Tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( p < 0.001) showed a significant increase in the PCOS group compared to the control. Testosterone enanthate induced PCOS causes stereological features in the ovary , increases the oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in mice.
