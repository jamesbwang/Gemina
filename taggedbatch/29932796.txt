 Besides initiation of tumor-specific T cell immunity , dendritic cells ( DCs) are endowed with tumoricidal activity. Previously , we showed that monocyte-derived DCs of high-grade glioma patients generated in the presence of interferon alpha ( IFNα) ( IFN-DCs) have impaired cytotoxic activity against tumor necrosis<symptom> factor alpha ( TNFα)- sensitive HEp-2 tumor cells. Herein , we demonstrate that decreased transmembrane TNFα ( tmTNFα) expression , but not soluble TNFα ( sTNFα) production by high-grade glioma patient IFN-DCs , determines the defective tumoricidal activity against TNFα-sensitive HEp-2 cells. Blocking TNFα-converting enzyme or stimulation of patient IFN-DCs with rIL-2 or dsDNA enhances tmTNFα expression on IFN-DCs and significantly increases their cytotoxicity. Decreased tmTNFα expression on patient IFN-DCs is not caused by downregulation of pNFκB. Neither rIL-2 nor dsDNA upregulates tmTNFα expression on patient IFN-DCs via an increase of pNFκB. The current study shows an important role of tmTNFα as mediator of IFN-DC tumoricidal activity and as molecular target for the restoration of defective DC killer activity in high-grade glioma patients.
