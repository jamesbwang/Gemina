 High-grade salivary gland cancer is a distinct clinical entity that has aggressive disease progression and early systemic spread. However , because of the rarity of the disease , the clinical outcomes , prognostic factors and clinical decision on the optimal treatments have not been fully understood. In this study , we retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 124 patients with high-grade salivary gland cancers and performed multivariate survival analyses to evaluate the clinico-pathological factors affecting the treatment outcomes. The 5-year disease-specific survival was 63.4 % in patients with high-grade salivary gland cancers. Among the clinico-pathological factors , presence of lymph node metastasis ( hazard ratio 5.63 , 95 % confidence interval 2.64-12.03 , P < 0.001) and distant metastasis ( hazard ratio 4.59 , 95 % confidence interval 2.10-10.04 , P < 0.001) at diagnosis were the most potent unfavorable prognostic factors. Importantly , patients with early-stage disease ( T1-2N0M0) showed apparently a relatively excellent prognosis ( 93.2 % 5-year disease-specific survival); meanwhile N ( +) and M1 status at diagnosis resulted in dismal outcomes ( 44.6 and 21.1 % 5-year disease-specific survival , respectively). On comparing surgery alone as a treatment modality , surgery plus postoperative radiation significantly benefited the patients , but the difference between adjuvant radiation and chemoradiation was not found to be significant. Pathological subtypes of high-grade salivary gland cancers were not significantly associated with prognosis. Despite of an overall unfavorable prognosis in high-grade salivary gland cancer , patients with early-stage disease are expected to have excellent prognosis ( over 90 % survival rates) with surgery plus adjuvant radiation , which may implicate the patients ' consultation , therapeutic decision making , and the need for early detection of the disease.
