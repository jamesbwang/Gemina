 To investigate the effects of maca extract on the ultrastructures of mitochondria in the spinal nerve cell and exercise endurance. The Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups , including the control group ( no swimming) , the swimming group ( free swimming) , and 3 treatment groups treated with the maca extract at the doses of 4.0 , 5.3 and 8.0 g/kg body<symptom> weight. The animals in swimming and treatment groups were then for free swimming in the circulating water flow daily for 15 days. On the 16 When rats were treated with maca extract ( at 4.0 , 5.3 , 8.0 g/kg body<symptom> weight) , the total swimming time and the swimming duration before sinking were increased by 19.83 % , 60.28 % , 77.55 % , and 55.34 % , 73.91 % , 94.47 % , respectively , compared with the simple swimming group ( Our results demonstrated the protective effects of maca extract on the mitochondria of spinal cell and suggested that maca extract could improve the muscle antioxidant activity by increasing the levels of SOD , GSH-Px , and muscle glycogen.
