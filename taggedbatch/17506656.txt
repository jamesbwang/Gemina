 Skeletal muscle is a heterogeneous tissue composed of a continuum of contracting fibers ranging from slow-type to fast-type fibers. Muscle damage is a frequent event and a susceptibility of fast-fibers to exercise-induced damage ( EIMD) or statins toxicity has been reported. Biological markers of muscle damage such as creatine kinase ( CK) are not fiber-type specific and new biomarkers are needed. Some microRNAs ( miRNAs) are specific to the muscle tissue , can be found in the extracellular compartment and can rise in the plasma following muscle damage. Our aim was to identify whether a set of circulating miRNAs can be used as fiber-type specific biomarkers of muscle damage in a model of traumatic ( crush) injuries induced either in the slow
