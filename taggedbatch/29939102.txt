 Riociguat is the treatment of choice for inoperable patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH). We addressed here whether additional balloon pulmonary angioplasty ( BPA) provides further benefits. A prospective series of 36 consecutive patients with inoperable CTEPH were treated with riociguat at least three months before BPA. All patients underwent diagnostic workup at baseline , before BPA treatments , and six months after final intervention. The main outcome measures were pulmonary hemodynamic parameters and World Health Organization ( WHO) functional class ( FC). Significant improvements in pulmonary hemodynamics and physical capacity were observed for riociguat treatment , and subsequent BPA interventions yielded further benefits. With targeted medication , WHO FC improved by at least one class in 13 ( 36.1 %) patients ( P = 0.01). Hemodynamic assessment showed significant improvements in mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( mPAP) ( 49 ± 12 mmHg vs. 43 ± 12 mmHg; P = 0.003) and PVR ( 956 ± 501 dyn · s · cm
