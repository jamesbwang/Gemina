 The measurement of antibodies against hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) is important to screen HCV<pathogen> infection. The aim of this study is to investigate the reliability of 2 commercially available anti-HCV antibody kits used in routine laboratory testing in Egypt. One thousand nine hundred and thirty-one serum samples were analyzed using 2 anti-HCV test systems: Cobas e 411 ® Elecsys Anti-HCVII and Vidas ® Anti-HCV Biomerieux. Discrepant samples were tested using the recombinant immunoblot assay Innogenetics ® INNO-LIA HCV<pathogen> Score. Overall agreement of the 2 tests was 94 %. Following discrepant sample testing by LIA , sensitivity and specificity using Vidas were 94 % and 99 % , respectively , while those for Cobas were 97 % and 96 % , respectively. This study demonstrates superior specificity by Vidas and higher sensitivity by Cobas. Both methods are suitable for laboratory and/or blood screening programs. The concomitant use of a supplementary or confirmatory assay is necessary to compare the accuracy of HCV<pathogen> serological assays.
