 Conceptualizing the construct of flow in terms of ` deep and effortless concentration ' , we developed two measurement scales designed to index individual differences in flow during ` internal ' tasks , such as thinking ( deep effortless concentration: internal-DECI) and during ` external ' tasks , such as while playing a sport ( deep effortless concentration: external-DECE). These scales were highly correlated , indicating that individuals prone to experiencing flow in external contexts are also prone to experience flow in internal contexts. Nonetheless , a measurement model construing internal and external flow as related , but separate , constructs was found to fit the data significantly better than a model where they were construed as a single construct. We then explored associations between flow and various forms of everyday inattention. In addition , we explored the relation between flow and the Tellegen Absorption Scale ( TAS) , an index of absorption , as well as the Big Five personality traits. Amongst other things , we found that flow was negatively related to inattention , indicating that people who experience flow more frequently may experience relatively less inattention in everyday contexts.
