 Biomechanical analysis of foot loading characteristics may provide insights into the injury mechanisms and guide orthotic prescription for basketball players. This study aimed to quantify in-shoe plantar pressure profiles in amateur players when executing typical basketball movements. Twenty male university basketball players performed four basketball-specific movement tasks-running , maximal forward sprinting , maximal 45 ° cutting , and layup-in a pair of standardized basketball shoes fitted with an in-shoe plantar pressure measurement system. Peak pressure ( PP) and pressure-time integral ( PTI) data were extracted from ten plantar regions. One-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed across the tasks , with significance set at P < .05. Distinct plantar pressure distribution patterns were observed among the four movements. Compared with running , significantly higher ( P < .05) PP and PTI of up to approximately 55 % were found in sprinting and layup , particularly at the forefoot region. Similarly , significantly higher ( P < .05) PPs and PTIs , ranging from approximately 23 % to 90 % , were observed in 45 ° cutting compared with running at most foot regions. Compared with running , sprinting and layup demonstrated higher plantar loading in the forefoot region , and 45 ° cutting yielded increased plantar loading in most regions of the foot. Understanding the plantar pressure characteristics of different movements may be useful in optimizing footwear designs , orthosis use , or training strategies to minimize regional plantar loading during amateur basketball play.
