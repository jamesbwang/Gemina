 Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy that is unable to be cured and has significant impact throughout the world. Front line treatment has shifted but ultimately has landed on a bortezomib-based combination therapy. Carfilzomib is a next-generation proteasome inhibitor shown to improve both progression-free and overall survival in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone ( KRd). Given the favorable response rates seen in phase II trials treating newly diagnosed myeloma , this combination is listed as a viable option for upfront treatment. This systematic review compares pharmacologic properties , clinical efficacy , and toxicities of carfilzomib- and bortezomib-based regimens.
