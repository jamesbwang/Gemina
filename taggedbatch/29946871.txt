 Gastric and esophageal dysmotility syndromes<disease><symptom> are some of the most common motility diagnoses , but little is known about their interrelationship. The aim of our study was to determine if a correlation exists between gastric and esophageal dysmotility syndromes<disease><symptom>. We reviewed the records of all patients who underwent both solid gastric emptying scintigraphy ( GES) and high-resolution esophageal manometry ( HRM) within a 2 year period , with both done between August 2012 and August 2017. All GESs were classified as either rapid , normal , or delayed. All HRMs were classified according to the Chicago Classification 3.0. Correlations were assessed using Fisher 's exact test and multiple logistic regression. In total , 482 patients met inclusion criteria. Of patients with a normal , delayed , and rapid GES , 53.1 , 64.5 , and 77.3 % had an abnormal HRM , respectively ( p < 0.05 vs. normal GES). Likewise , patients with an abnormal HRM were more likely to have an abnormal GES ( 54.9 vs. 41.8 % , p = 0.005). Multiple logistic regression showed abnormal GES ( odds ratio ( OR) 2.14) , age ( OR 1.013) , scleroderma ( OR 6.29) , and dysphagia<symptom> ( OR 2.63) were independent predictors of an abnormal HRM. Likewise , an abnormal HRM ( OR 2.11) , diabetes ( OR 1.85) , heart or lung transplantation ( OR 2.61) , and autonomic dysfunction ( OR 2.37) were independent predictors of an abnormal GES. The correlation between an abnormal GES and HRM argues for common pathogenic mechanisms of these motility disorders , and possibly common future treatment options. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for another motility disorder if one is present.
