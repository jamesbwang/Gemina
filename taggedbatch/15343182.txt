 Although neonates and young infants with cholestasis are commonly treated with either phenobarbital or ursodeoxycholic acid ( ursodiol) , there is no evidence that phenobarbital is effective for this indication. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of ursodiol and phenobarbital for the treatment of cholestasis in a diverse NICU population. This is a retrospective cohort study including infants with cholestasis who were admitted to a Level IV NICU between January 2010 and December 2015. Drug courses of phenobarbital and ursodiol were identified within the medical record , and medical , demographic , and drug information were extracted. The primary outcome was reduction in direct bilirubin. Sixty-eight infants provided a total of 112 courses of drug therapy for comparison. Diverse medical diagnoses were captured in the patient cohort. Ursodiol was significantly more effective in reducing direct bilirubin than was phenobarbital (- 1.89 vs + 0.76 mg/dL;- 33.33 vs + 13.0 umol/L , p-value 0.03) , even after controlling for baseline cholestasis severity , intrauterine growth restriction status , and lipid lowering therapy (- 2.16 vs + 0.27 mg/dl;- 36.94 vs + 4.62 umol/L , p-value 0.03). There was no improvement in direct bilirubin in the majority of infants treated with phenobarbital. Phenobarbital , as compared to ursodiol , has limited efficacy for the reduction of direct bilirubin in neonates and young infants with cholestasis. Given new data regarding the potential neurotoxicity of phenobarbital in the developing brain , providers may choose to avoid phenobarbital in the treatment of cholestasis in infants.
