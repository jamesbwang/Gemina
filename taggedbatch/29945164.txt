 In this study , we first reported a lateral flow assay combined with primer extension ( PEXT) and gold nanoparticles for single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) genotyping of the tmigd1 gene of the Tsaiya ducks ( Anas platyrhynchos) , which has the advantages of simplicity of operation , cost-effectiveness , and time-saving. Gold nanoparticles were tailed with thiol-thymine oligodeoxyribonucleotides ( thiol- ( dT) 30) using the salt-aging method at 25 °C and used as a label in a lateral flow assay. The lateral flow device was composed of test and control zones on a nitrocellulose membrane containing streptavidin and adenosine oligodeoxyribonucleotides ( ( dA) 30) , respectively. When the specific SNP existed , the corresponding primers were extended , and the reaction product was captured by streptavidin at the test zone owing to the introduction of biotin-deoxyuridine triphosphate ( biotin-dUTP) into the reaction product during PEXT. Gold nanoparticles hybridized with the reaction product to render it visible. Here , we developed a new system for detection of single nucleotide polymorphism in a female reproduction-associated gene , tmigd1 , of Anas platyrhynchos using the strip biosensor , and identified the optimized parameters for the concentration of Mg2 + in the PEXT reaction and the amount of streptavidin used on membranes<symptom> for signal specificity.
