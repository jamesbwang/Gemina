 Although conventional metasurfaces have demonstrated many promising functionalities in light control by tailoring either phase or spectral responses of subwavelength structures , simultaneous control of both responses has not been explored yet. Here , we propose a concept of dual-mode metasurfaces that enables simultaneous control of phase and spectral responses for two kinds of operation modes of transmission and reflection , respectively. In the transmission mode , the dual-mode metasurface acts as conventional metasurfaces by tailoring phase distribution of incident light. In the reflection mode , a reflected colored image is produced under white light illumination. We also experimentally demonstrate a crypto-display as one application of the dual-mode metasurface. The crypto-display looks a normal reflective display under white light illumination but generates a hologram that reveals the encrypted phase information under single-wavelength coherent light illumination. Because two operation modes do not affect each other , the crypto-display can have applications in security techniques.
