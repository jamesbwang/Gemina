 To assess how the current practice of newborn screening ( NBS) for homocystinurias compares with published recommendations. Twenty-two of 32 NBS programmes from 18 countries screened for at least one form of homocystinuria. Centres provided pseudonymised NBS data from patients with cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency ( CBSD , n = 19) , methionine adenosyltransferase I/III deficiency ( MATI/IIID , n = 28) , combined remethylation disorder ( cRMD , n = 56) and isolated remethylation disorder ( iRMD) , including methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency ( MTHFRD) ( n = 8). Markers and decision limits were converted to multiples of the median ( MoM) to allow comparison between centres. NBS programmes , algorithms and decision limits varied considerably. Only nine centres used the recommended second-tier marker total homocysteine ( tHcy). The median decision limits of all centres were ≥ 2.35 for high and ≤ 0.44 MoM for low methionine , ≥ 1.95 for high and ≤ 0.47 MoM for low methionine/phenylalanine , ≥ 2.54 for high propionylcarnitine and ≥ 2.78 MoM for propionylcarnitine/acetylcarnitine. These decision limits alone had a 100 % , 100 % , 86 % and 84 % sensitivity for the detection of CBSD , MATI/IIID , iRMD and cRMD , respectively , but failed to detect six individuals with cRMD. To enhance sensitivity and decrease second-tier testing costs , we further adapted these decision limits using the data of 15,000 healthy newborns. Due to the favourable outcome of early treated patients , NBS for homocystinurias is recommended. To improve NBS , decision limits should be revised considering the population median. Relevant markers should be combined; use of the postanalytical tools offered by the CLIR project ( Collaborative Laboratory Integrated Reports , which considers , e.g. birth weight and gestational age) is recommended. tHcy and methylmalonic acid should be implemented as second-tier markers.
