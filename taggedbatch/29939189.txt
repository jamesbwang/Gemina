 A quick , automated and portable system for the separation and determination of radiostrontium in aqueous samples , using Sr-resin and multi sequential flow injection analysis , has been developed. The concentrations of radioactive strontium were determined by flow scintillation counting , allowing for on-line and also on-site determination. The proposed system can determine radioactive strontium at industrial relevant levels without further modification using overall analysis time of less than 10 min per aqueous sample. The limit of the detection is 320 fg Â· g
