 Changes of direction ( CoDs) have a high metabolic and mechanical impact in field and court team sports , but the estimation of the associated workload is still inaccurate. This study aims at validating an algorithm based on kinematic data to estimate the energy cost of running with frequent 180 °- CoDs. Twenty-six physically active male subjects ( 22.4 ± 3.2 years) participated in two sessions: ( 1) maximum oxygen uptake ( V̇O
