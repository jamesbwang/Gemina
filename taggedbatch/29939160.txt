 High-risk neuroblastoma is a devastating malignancy with very limited therapeutic options. Here , we identify withaferin A ( WA) as a natural ferroptosis-inducing agent in neuroblastoma , which acts through a novel double-edged mechanism. WA dose-dependently either activates the nuclear factor-like 2 pathway through targeting of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 ( noncanonical ferroptosis induction) or inactivates glutathione peroxidase 4 ( canonical ferroptosis induction). Noncanonical ferroptosis induction is characterized by an increase in intracellular labile Fe ( II) upon excessive activation of heme oxygenase-1 , which is sufficient to induce ferroptosis. This double-edged mechanism might explain the superior efficacy of WA as compared with etoposide or cisplatin in killing a heterogeneous panel of high-risk neuroblastoma cells , and in suppressing the growth and relapse rate of neuroblastoma xenografts. Nano-targeting of WA allows systemic application and suppressed tumor growth due to an enhanced accumulation at the tumor site. Collectively , our data propose a novel therapeutic strategy to efficiently kill cancer cells by ferroptosis.
