 This study aims to reflect on the intertwining of certain key ideas about what we call `` health '' within the hegemonic biomedical paradigm: health , disease , health needs , medicalization and medical-industrial complex. This reflection is based on the philosophical contributions of Heller and Wiggins on needs; on the discussion of some authors , especially Canguilhem , about health and illness; and Collins ' sociology of expertise. After pointing out some of the conundrums that arise from the conceptual fluidity of the topics abovementioned , we present a path forward , based on Collins ' proposals about the role of experts in political arguments , to resituate the discussion on health needs.
