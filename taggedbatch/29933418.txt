 To analyze the concept of patient discharge in leprosy<disease>. Theoretical study guided in the methodological framework of concept analysis. A bibliographical survey was held from December 2015 to January 2016 using the following bases: SCOPUS , CINAHL , PubMed , LILACS , SCIELO and BDENF , by use of the descriptors `` Leprosy<disease> '' and `` Patient Discharge '' , resulting in 13 studies. The following were identified as possible uses for the concept: discharge by cure , drug use discharge , bacteriological discharge and post-discharge. The attributes defined were completion of multidrug therapy , completion of multidrug therapy for paucibacillary leprosy<disease> , completion of multidrug therapy for multibacillary leprosy<disease> and cure from leprosy<disease>. The presence of an M.<pathogen> leprae<pathogen> infection , symptoms present in skin and peripheral nerves , diagnosis and treatment and leprosy<disease> reactions were identified as antecedents. Consequents were exclusion from the active leprosy<disease> record and continuity of health care. One case model and one opposing case were presented. The analysis broadened the concept `` discharge in leprosy<disease> '' , providing other meanings than the clinical definition of multidrug therapy.
