 To examine the diagnosis of health anxiety<symptom> , its prevalence in different settings , public health significance , treatment , and outcome. Health anxiety<symptom> is similar to hypochondriasis but is characterized by fear of , rather than conviction of , illness. Lifetime prevalence rates are 6 % in the population and as high as 20 % in hospital out-patients , leading to greater costs to health services through unnecessary medical contacts. Its prevalence may be increasing because of excessive internet browsing ( cyberchondria). Drug treatment with antidepressants has some efficacy but is not well-liked , but psychological treatments , including cognitive behavior therapy , stress management , mindfulness training , and acceptance and commitment therapy , given either individually , in groups , or over the Internet , have all proved efficacious in both the short and longer term. Untreated health anxiety<symptom> leads to premature mortality. Health anxiety<symptom> has become an increasing clinical and public health issue at a time when people are being formally asked to take more responsibility in monitoring their own health. More attention by health services is needed.
