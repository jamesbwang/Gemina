 Although oxaliplatin 130 mg/m Patients with unresectable or recurrent gastric adenocarcinoma , no previous chemotherapy , and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0-1 were treated with SOX130. The primary endpoint was the 3-cycle completion rate , defined as the proportion of patients who completed the first three cycles with â‰¥ 80 % relative dose intensity of oxaliplatin. Twenty-five patients were enrolled from April 2015 to 2016. The 3-cycle completion rate was 72.0 % ( 90 % confidence interval: 53.8-86.1) , which was higher than the predetermined threshold rate of 50 %. With the median number of cycles being 6 ( range , 1-19 +) , grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 10 patients ( 40 %). Major grade 3 adverse events were anorexia<symptom> ( 24 %) , thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( 16 %) , and neutropenia ( 12 %). No febrile neutropenia or treatment-related deaths occurred. Among 12 patients with measurable lesions<symptom> , the overall response rate was 58.3 %. Median progression-free and overall survival were 5.7 months ( 95 % confidence interval 2.9-8.5) and 13.1 months ( 95 % confidence interval 7.4-19.0) , respectively. Results indicated that SOX130 was feasible in Japanese patients with advanced gastric cancer.
