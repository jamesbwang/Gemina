 NR4A1 ( Nur77 or NGFI-B) , an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily , has been identified as a key regulator of the differentiation and function of myeloid , lymphoid , and mesenchymal cells. The detailed role of NR4A1 in bone biology is incompletely understood. Here , we report a role for NR4A1 as novel factor controlling the migration and recruitment of osteoclast precursors during bone remodeling. Myeloid-specific but not osteoblast-specific deletion of NR4A1 resulted in osteopenia due to an increase in the number of bone-lining osteoclasts. Although NR4A1-deficient osteoclast precursors displayed a regular differentiation into mature osteoclasts , they showed a hyper-motile phenotype that was largely dependent on increased osteopontin expression , suggesting that expression of NR4A1 negatively controlled osteopontin-mediated recruitment of osteoclast precursors to the trabecular bone. Pharmacological activation of NR4A1 , in turn , inhibited osteopontin expression and osteopontin-dependent migration of osteoclast precursors resulted in reduced abundance of bone-resorbing osteoclasts in vivo as well as in an ameliorated bone loss after ovariectomy in mice. This study identifies NR4A1 as a crucial player in the regulation of osteoclast biology and bone remodeling and highlights this nuclear receptor as a promising target for therapeutic intervention during the treatment of osteoporosis.
