 Caring for a mentally ill family member is a challenging task. Caregivers who are first-degree relatives ( FDR) are at a higher risk of experiencing the negative consequences of caregiving. This study was aimed at determining burden of care and its correlates in caregivers who are first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia. A dyad of 255 patients and caregivers was recruited. A socio-demographic questionnaire was administered to both. The GHQ-12 was used to screen for psychiatric morbidity in the FDRs. Caregiver 's burden was assessed with the Zarit Burden Interview. Patients ' illness severity and level of functioning were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning scales respectively. The mean ± SD age of caregivers and patients were 45.1 ± 12.3 and 36.7 ± 13.4 years respectively. About 49 % of caregivers experienced high burden of care. Older caregiver 's age ( r = 0.179; p < 0.004) and greater illness severity ( r = 0.332; p < 0.0001) in the patient had weak to moderate positive correlation with burden of care. Caregiver 's burden also increased with poorer functioning of the patient ( r = -0.467 p < 0.0001). Independent predictors of caregiver burden were low level of education of the caregiver ( OR 2.45; 95 % CI 1.27-4.73) , psychiatric morbidity in the caregiver ( OR 6.74; 95 % CI 2.51-18.15) and poor patient functioning ( OR 2.81; 95 % CI 1.27-6.18). Caregivers who are first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia experience varying degrees of burden of care during caregiving. Routine screening and early psychological intervention would help to ameliorate these negative consequences of caregiving.
