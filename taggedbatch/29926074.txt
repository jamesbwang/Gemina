 Recently , there has been a growing interest in the roles of androgen in the development of obesity and obesity-related diseases such as diabetes , metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> , atherosclerosis ( AS) , hypertension and cardiovascular diseases , as well as in the disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism. Androgen exerts its biological role mainly through binding to the androgen receptor ( AR) , one of the nuclear receptors widely expressed in multiple tissues such as the skeletal muscle , liver , adipose tissue and brain. Low testosterone and AR deficiency result in obesity , obesity-related diseases and metabolic disorders. Androgen regulates almost all the intracellular transduction pathways related to glucose and lipid metabolism , including key metabolic enzymes/proteins , nuclear transcription factors ( PPARγ , LXRα and FoxO1) , inflammation<symptom> , leptin sensitivity of hypothalamus , proliferation and differentiation of adipocyte , mitochondrial function and vascular endothelial function. In addition , females with high androgen are more likely to develop obesity as well as glucose and lipid metabolism disorders , while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This review focuses on the role and underlying mechanisms of androgen and AR in the development of obesity and obesity-related diseases as well as glucose and lipid metabolism disturbance in men.
