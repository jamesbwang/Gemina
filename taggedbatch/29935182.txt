 Schistosomes are parasitic platyhelminths that threaten over 600 million people globally. In recent years , RNA interference ( RNAi) has been widely used as a molecular tool in research into the genomic function of parasites. We aim to develop effective protocols for application of RNAi technology in the intra-mammalian life stages of Schistosoma japonicum. In this work , the expression of the parasite gene encoding cathepsin B1 ( SjCB1) was targeted by exposing the worms to 10 μg of long dsRNA dissolved in 0.1 ml of 0.7 % NaCl injected into the tail vein of infected mice. This method was effective and specific for eliciting SjCB1 gene suppression in both male and female adult worms in vivo ( > 79.4 % in male and > 91.5 % in female knockdown relative to control). In 60 cercaria infected mice , RNAi suppression of gene expression was best achieved by using 10 μg of target dsRNA for at least 4 days. The recommended procedure for interference producing long-term suppression was an injection of dsRNA on the first day of infection with booster injections administered every 4 days for up to 26 days. Long-term suppression of three published functional genes ( peroxiredoxin-1 , mago nashi , insulin receptor) in S. japonicum provided more information about the role of the expression of these genes in producing particular phenotypes. The protocols described here may be more convenient , economical and applicable , than currently available technology and have contributed to the observation of more phenotypes during worm development from schistosomula to adult<disease>. These approaches may promote and facilitate further studies into functional schistosome genomics.
