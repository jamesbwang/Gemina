 In this paper , a novel robot-assisted catheter operating system ( RCOS) has been proposed as a method to reduce physical stress and X-ray exposure time to physicians during endovascular procedures. The unique design of this system allows the physician to apply conventional bedside catheterization skills ( advance , retreat and rotate) to an input catheter , which is placed at the master side to control another patient catheter placed at the slave side. For this purpose , a magnetorheological ( MR) fluids-based master haptic interface has been developed to measure the axial and radial motions of an input catheter , as well as to provide the haptic feedback to the physician during the operation. In order to achieve a quick response of the haptic force in the master haptic interface , a hall sensor-based closed-loop control strategy is employed. In slave side , a catheter manipulator is presented to deliver the patient catheter , according to position commands received from the master haptic interface. The contact forces between the patient catheter and blood vessel system can be measured by designed force sensor unit of catheter manipulator. Four levels of haptic force are provided to make the operator aware of the resistance encountered by the patient catheter during the insertion procedure. The catheter manipulator was evaluated for precision positioning. The time lag from the sensed motion to replicated motion is tested. To verify the efficacy of the proposed haptic feedback method , the evaluation experiments in vitro are carried out. The results demonstrate that the proposed system has the ability to enable decreasing the contact forces between the catheter and vasculature.
