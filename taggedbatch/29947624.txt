 Understanding the formation and transformation of sulphur-rich particles is of prime importance since they contribute to the global atmospheric sulphur budget. In this work , we performed a series of experiments on a photoactive organosulphur compound namely , methyl thioglycolate , as a model of an organosulphur species of marine origin. By investigating the photoproducts within levitated droplets , we showed that elemental sulphur ( Î±-S8) and sulphate ( SO42-) can be photochemically generated at the gas-liquid interface by heterogeneous interaction with gaseous O2 and H2O. These results demonstrate that the surface of levitated droplets facilitate the oxidation of methyl thioglycolate in the dark , while illumination is necessary to produce the oxidation in bulk experiments.
