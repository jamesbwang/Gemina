 Erwinia<pathogen> ligand-gated ion channel ( ELIC) is a bacterial homologue of vertebrate pentameric ligand-gated ion channels ( pLGICs) and has proven to be a valuable model for understanding the structure and function of this important protein family. There is nevertheless still a question about whether molecular details can be accurately extrapolated from this protein to those found in eukaryotes. Here we explore the role of proline residues ( Pros) in ELIC by creating mutant receptors , expressing them in Xenopus laevis oocytes , and using whole-cell voltage-clamp electrophysiology to monitor channel activity. In contrast to eukaryotic pLGICs , proline-to-alanine ( Pro-to-Ala) substitution in ELIC mostly resulted in gain of function , and even altering highly conserved Pro residues in M1 and the M2-M3 loop did not ablate function. These substitutions also mostly resulted in ablation of the modulation by Ca
