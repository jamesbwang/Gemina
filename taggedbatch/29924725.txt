 Tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> ( TB) , caused by Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> , is one of the deadliest and most important infectious<disease> diseases<disease> worldwide. The sphingomyelinase/ceramide system , which has been shown several times to be a crucial factor in the internalization , processing and killing of diverse pathogens , also modulates the pro-inflammatory response and the state of mycobacteria in macrophages. Both acid and neutral sphingomyelinases are important in this activity. However , studies of the role of sphingomyelinases in TB are still at an early stage.
