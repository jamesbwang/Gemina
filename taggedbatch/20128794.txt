 The predictive value of factor V Leiden and the G20210A prothrombin mutation regarding recurrent venous thromboembolism ( VTE) is limited and does not influence subsequent patient management. Systematic testing for such genetic thrombophilia should be avoided , but to which extent such testing is practiced in a Swiss Hospital is unknown. To examine the current practice of factor V Leiden and/or G20210A prothrombin mutation testing in a University Hospital , and to assess the clinical consequences of testing on patients. 1388 adult patients ( 48.7 % women) with a main diagnosis of VTE hospitalized at the Lausanne university hospital between January 2013 and December 2015. FV Leiden and/or prothrombin G20210A mutation testing was performed in 61 ( 4.4 %) patients with VTE , an average of 20 patients/year. On multivariable analysis , age < 65 years ( odds ratio and ( 95 % confidence interval) 5.91 ( 3.12-11.19)) , being admitted in a medical ward ( 5.71 ( 2.02-16.16)) and staying in the intensive care unit ( 0.34 ( 0.12-0.97)) were associated with thrombophilia testing. No differences were found between patients with and without testing regarding in-hospital mortality ( OR and 95 % CI for tested vs. non-tested: 0.23 ( 0.03-1.73) , p = 0.153) and length of stay ( multivariable adjusted average ± standard error: 16.9 ± 3.3 vs. 20.0 ± 0.7 days for tested and non-tested patients , respectively , p = 0.875). Thrombophilia testing in hospitalized patients with a main diagnosis of VTE is seldom performed. FV Leiden and/or prothrombin G20210A mutation should not be routinely assessed in patients with acute VTE.
