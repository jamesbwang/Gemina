 Ponds are an important ecosystem in rural landscapes. They play an important role in water retention , aquatic products supply and biodiversity conservation. By using a questionnaire-based survey of rural households in a small watershed in the Three Gorges Reservoir area , we analyzed the distribution of ponds , their size and current status.

We found that pond density was high throughout hilly areas. About 20 ponds were within an area of 1 km
