 A decade ago , a novel mechanism to drive thermodynamically unfavorable redox reactions was discovered that is used in prokaryotes to drive endergonic electron transfer reactions by a direct coupling to an exergonic redox reaction in one soluble enzyme complex. This process is referred to as flavinbased electron bifurcation , or FBEB. An important function of FBEB is that it allows the generation of reduced low-potential ferredoxin ( Fd
