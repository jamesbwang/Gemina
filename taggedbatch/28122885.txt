 Ethnic minority populations in the United States ( US) are disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease ( CVD) risk factors , including hypertension , overweight/obesity , and diabetes. The size and diversity of ethnic minority immigrant populations in the US have increased substantially over the past three decades. However , most studies on immigrants in the US are limited to Asians and Hispanics; only a few have examined the prevalence of CVD risk factors across diverse immigrant populations. The prevalence of diagnosed hypertension , overweight/obesity , and diagnosed diabetes was examined and contrasted among a socioeconomically diverse sample of immigrants. It was hypothesized that considerable variability would exist in the prevalence of hypertension , overweight and diabetes. A cross-sectional analysis of the 2010-2016 National Health Interview Survey ( NHIS) was conducted among 41,717 immigrants born in Europe , South America , Mexico/Central America/Caribbean , Russia , Africa , Middle<pathogen> East , Indian subcontinent , Asia and Southeast Asia. The outcomes were the prevalence of diagnosed hypertension , overweight/obesity , and diagnosed diabetes. The highest multivariable adjusted prevalence of diagnosed hypertension was observed in Russian ( 24.2 %) and Southeast Asian immigrants ( 23.5 %). Immigrants from Mexico/Central America/Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent had the highest prevalence of overweight/obesity ( 71.5 and 73.4 % , respectively) and diagnosed diabetes ( 9.6 and 10.1 % , respectively). Compared to European immigrants , immigrants from Mexico/Central America/Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent respectively had higher prevalence of overweight/obesity ( Prevalence Ratio ( PR): 1.19 ( 95 % CI , 1.13-1.24)) and ( PR: 1.22 ( 95 % CI , 1.14-1.29)) , and diabetes ( PR: 1.70 ( 95 % CI , 1.42-2.03)) and ( PR: 1.78 ( 95 % CI , 1.36-2.32)). African immigrants and Middle Eastern<disease> immigrants had a higher prevalence of diabetes ( PR: 1.41 ( 95 % CI , 1.01-1.96)) and PR: 1.57 ( 95 % CI: 1.09-2.25) , respectively , than European immigrants- without a corresponding higher prevalence of overweight/obesity. Immigrants from Mexico/Central America/Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent bore the highest burden of overweight/obesity and diabetes while those from Southeast Asia and Russia bore the highest burden of hypertension.
