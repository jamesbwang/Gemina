 Leishmaniasis<disease> is one of the most important neglected tropical diseases , with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. Among the clinical manifestations of the disease , cutaneous leishmaniasis<disease> , caused by species of Leishmania<pathogen> braziliensis , presents wide distribution in Brazil. In this work , we performed the cloning , expression , and purification of the enzyme superoxide dismutase of Leishmania<pathogen> braziliensis ( LbSOD-B2) considered a promising target for the search of new compounds against leishmaniasis<disease>. In vitro assays based on pyrogallol oxidation showed that LbSOD-B2 is most active around pH 8 and hydrogen peroxide is a LbSOD-B2 inhibitor at low millimolar range ( IC
