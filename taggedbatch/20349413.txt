 Malignant renal epithelioid angiomyolipoma ( EAML) is an extremely rare disease with a poor prognosis , and currently there are no uniform criteria for its biological behavior. Here , we present a case of malignant renal EAML with TFE3 gene amplification in a 53-year-old woman. Four months after surgery , unenhanced computed tomography scans showed recurrence as well as metastasis in the abdomen and lung. The patient succumbed to rapid neoplastic progression of the disease 6 months later.
