 The results of an experimental investigation on the physical and chemical characteristics of cement-based materials under laser interactions are presented. The laser cutting tests were conducted using a multi-mode continuous fiber laser with a laser power of 1 kW. The experimental variables were laser speed , water to cement ratio , and material compositions including cement paste , cement mortar , and ultra high-performance concrete ( UHPC). In order to evaluate the mass removal mechanisms of cement-based materials under laser interactions , the effect of laser cutting was evaluated in terms of kerf width , penetration depth , and chemical composition changes before and after the interaction with laser using EDX analysis. The test results reveal that adding silica sand in cement-based materials leads to decreasing penetration depth and increasing kerf width. Unlike the cement paste and cement mortar series , UHPC specimens showed no discernible crack observed by the naked eye after laser interaction due to its high strength. Furthermore , the chemical analysis indicates that chemical composition changes were caused by various mechanisms including dehydration<symptom> of calcium hydroxide and thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate.
