 Podocytes are a major component of the glomerular blood filtration barrier , and alterations to the morphology of their unique actin-based foot processes ( FP) are a common feature of kidney disease. Adjacent FP are connected by a specialized intercellular junction known as the slit diaphragm ( SD) , which serves as the ultimate barrier to regulate passage of macromolecules from the blood. While the link between SD dysfunction and reduced filtration selectivity has been recognized for nearly 50 years , our understanding of the underlying molecular circuitry began only 20 years ago , sparked by the identification of
