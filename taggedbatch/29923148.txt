 Skeletal muscle glycogen is an important energy source for muscle contraction and a key regulator of metabolic responses to exercise. Manipulation of muscle glycogen is therefore a strategy to improve performance in competitions and potentially adaptation to training. However , assessing muscle glycogen in the field is impractical , and there are no normative values for glycogen concentration at rest and during exercise. The objective of this study was to meta-analyse the effects of fitness , acute dietary carbohydrate ( CHO) availability and other factors on muscle glycogen concentration at rest and during exercise of different durations and intensities. PubMed was used to search for original articles in English published up until February 2018. Search terms included muscle glycogen and exercise , filtered for humans. The analysis incorporated 181 studies of continuous or intermittent cycling and running by healthy participants , with muscle glycogen at rest and during exercise determined by biochemical analysis of biopsies. Resting muscle glycogen was determined with a meta-regression mixed model that included fixed effects for fitness status ( linear , as maximal oxygen uptake ( ( Formula: see text) O The resting glycogen concentration in the vastus lateralis of males with normal CHO availability and ( Formula: see text) O Dietary CHO availability and fitness are important factors for resting muscle glycogen. Exercise intensity and baseline muscle glycogen are important factors determining glycogen use during exercise , especially with longer exercise duration. The meta-analysed effects may be useful normative values for prescription of endurance exercise.
