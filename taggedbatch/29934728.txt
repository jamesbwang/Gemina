 Recent advances in magnetic sensing has made on-scalp magnetoencephalography ( MEG) possible. In particular , optically-pumped magnetometers ( OPMs) have reached sensitivity levels that enable their use in MEG. In contrast to the SQUID sensors used in current MEG systems , OPMs do not require cryogenic cooling and can thus be placed within millimetres from the head , enabling the construction of sensor arrays that conform to the shape of an individual 's head. To properly estimate the location of neural sources within the brain , one must accurately know the position and orientation of sensors in relation to the head. With the adaptable on-scalp MEG sensor arrays , this coregistration becomes more challenging than in current SQUID-based MEG systems that use rigid sensor arrays. Here , we used simulations to quantify how accurately one needs to know the position and orientation of sensors in an on-scalp MEG system. The effects that different types of localisation errors have on forward modelling and source estimates obtained by minimum-norm estimation , dipole fitting , and beamforming are detailed. We found that sensor position errors generally have a larger effect than orientation errors and that these errors affect the localisation accuracy of superficial sources the most. To obtain similar or higher accuracy than with current SQUID-based MEG systems , RMS sensor position and orientation errors should be ( Formula: see text) and ( Formula: see text) , respectively.
