 In the United States , universal screening for latent tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) infection among people with HIV<pathogen> is recommended , but the percentage receiving screening is unknown. This study assessed screening for latent TB infection among people with HIV<pathogen> enrolled in Medicaid during 2006-2010. We used nationwide fee-for-service Medicaid records to identify people with HIV<pathogen> , measure screening for latent TB infection , and examine associated demographic , social , and clinical factors. We used logistic regression analysis to calculate odds ratios ( ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). We created 2 multivariate models to prevent collinearity between variables for length of HIV<pathogen> infection. Of 152831 people with HIV<pathogen> , 26239 ( 17.2 %) were screened for latent TB infection. The factor most strongly associated with screening was TB exposure or suspected TB ( OR = 3.78; 95 % CI , 3.27-4.37). Significant demographic characteristics associated with screening included being African American ( OR = 1.28; 95 % CI , 1.24-1.32) or â‰¤ 20 years of age ( OR = 1.35; 95 % CI , 1.28-1.42). Significant clinical and social factors associated with screening included poor housing conditions , low body mass index , chemotherapy treatment , and use of certain substances ( ORs ranged from 1.24 ( 95 % CI , 1.20-1.27) to 1.47 ( 95 % CI , 1.22-1.76)). The screening rate for latent TB infection was higher among people with newly diagnosed HIV<pathogen> infection than among those with established infection ( OR = 1.37; 95 % CI , 1.32-1.41) and among people with a longer established HIV<pathogen> infection than among those with shorter HIV<pathogen> infection ( OR = 1.24; 95 % CI , 1.23-1.26 for each additional year). Screening for latent TB infection among fee-for-service Medicaid beneficiaries with HIV<pathogen> was suboptimal , despite the presence of demographic , social , or clinical characteristics that should have increased the likelihood of screening. The lack of certain data in Medicaid may have resulted in an underestimation of screening.
