 Continual renewal of the intestinal epithelium is dependent on active- and slow-cycling stem cells that are confined to the crypt base. Tight regulation of these stem cell populations maintains homeostasis by balancing proliferation and differentiation to support critical intestinal functions. The hierarchical relation of discrete stem cell populations in homeostasis or during regenerative epithelial repair remains controversial. Although recent studies have supported a model for the active-cycling leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 ( Lgr5) We used novel monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs) raised against murine intestinal epithelial cells in conjunction with ISC-green fluorescent protein ( GFP) reporter mice to analyze relations between ISC populations by microscopy. Ex vivo 3-dimensional cultures , flow cytometry , and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses were performed. Two novel mAbs recognized distinct subpopulations of the intestinal epithelium and when used in combination permitted isolation of discrete Lgr5 These data showed the functional utility of murine mAbs in the isolation and investigation of Lgr5
