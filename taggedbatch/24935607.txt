 Despite its efficacy , the uptake of HU in adults with sickle cell disease ( SCD) is poor likely due to a combination of system , provider , and patient-related factors. We investigated attitudes of adult patients towards HU by conducting qualitative interviews with 95 adult SCD patients ( age 18 to 67 years old , 71 were female). While 53 % of all participants reported that they were currently taking HU , patients ranging in age 18-30 years ( Group 1) were more likely to report current HU use as compared to those ( Group 2) ranging in age 31-67 years ( 65 % vs. 41 % P = 0.01). Most Group 1 participants who reported currently taking HU indicated that the decision to start HU was made by a parent , though some made the decision themselves as a young adult. Group 1 participants expressed trust in the efficacy of HU as well as trust that their physician adequately shared risks and benefits for the medication. The Group 2 participants , who were not currently on HU , were skeptical that all the risks and benefits of HU were known , were concerned that the efficacy of HU was not proven , and that they were not receiving complete information about its potential side effects. Of Group 2 participants who reported currently being on HU , 25 % were concerned about the side effects and efficacy of HU and reported continuing HU because of a lack of effective alternatives. These data suggest that there are significant differences by age in adult SCD patients ' attitudes towards , utilization and understanding of the risks and benefits of HU.
