 To investigate the effect of microRNA-125b ( miR-125b) on osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cell ( PDLSCs). The surface factor of isolated PDLSCs was detected by flow cytometry. After transfected with miR-125b or anti-miR125b in PDLSCs , MTT and LDH were used to detect cell viability and cytotoxicity; ALP activity and calcium level were detected by ALP assay kit and calcium colorimetric assay kit. Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to determine the expression of osteogenesis-related genes. The interaction between miR-125b and connexin 43 ( Cx43) was detected by dual luciferase gene reporter assay. The data were analyzed with SPSS 17.0 software. The cultured PDLSCs showed the characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells. After transfected with miR-125b in PDLSCs , the cell viability was decreased , cytotoxicity was increased; ALP activity , calcium level and the expression of osteogenesis-related genes were significantly decreased. On the contrary , cell viability , ALP activity , calcium level and the expression of osteogenesis-related genes in PDLSCs were increased after anti-miR-125b transfection. Dual luciferase gene reporter assay showed that miR-125b could target Cx43. In addition , the effect of miR-125b on osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs was reversed after Cx43 overexpression. miR-125b may inhibit osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs by targeting Cx43.
