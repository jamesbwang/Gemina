 Leaves are the most conspicuous planar organs in plants , designed for efficient capture of sunlight and its conversion to energy that is channeled into sustaining the entire biosphere. How a few founder cells derived from the shoot apical meristem give rise to diverse leaf forms has interested naturalists and developmental biologists alike. At the heart of leaf morphogenesis lie two simple cellular processes , division and expansion , that are spatially and temporally segregated in a developing leaf. In leaves of dicot model species , cell division occurs predominantly at the base , concomitant with the expansion and differentiation of cells at the tip of the lamina that drives increase in leaf surface area. The timing of the transition from one cell fate ( division) to the other ( expansion) within a growing leaf lamina is a critical determinant of final leaf shape , size , complexity and flatness. The TCP proteins , unique to plant kingdom , are sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors that control several developmental and physiological traits. A sub-group of class II TCPs , called CINCINNATA-like TCPs ( CIN-TCPs henceforth) , are key regulators of the timing of the transition from division to expansion in dicot leaves. The current review highlights recent advances in our understanding of how the pattern of CIN-TCP activity is translated to the dynamic spatio-temporal control of cell-fate transition through the transactivation of cell-cycle regulators , growth-repressing microRNAs , and interactions with the chromatin remodeling machinery to modulate phytohormone responses. Unravelling how environmental inputs influence CIN-TCP-mediated growth control is a challenge for future studies. Â© 2018 IUBMB Life , 2018.
