 Smoking is a major risk factor driving the tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) epidemic and smokers ' alveolar macrophages ( AM) demonstrate significant immune defects following infection. Recently , macrophage glycolytic reprogramming has emerged as crucial in the early host immune response to Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> ( Mtb) infection. To compare baseline metabolic characteristics and the glycolytic response to infection of human AM from smokers and non-smokers. AM were obtained at bronchoscopy and extracellular flux analyses performed to determine baseline metabolic characteristics compared to human monocyte derived macrophages ( MDM). Metabolic characterisation of AM from smokers and non-smokers was performed similarly. Following infection with Mtb , differences in glycolytic response were measured by extracellular flux analyses and gene expression analyses , and correlated with production of the glycolysis-driven IL-1Î² and PGE2. Similar experiments were performed in cigarette smoke extract ( CSE)- treated MDM as an alternative model. At baseline , human AM from non-smokers have a significantly lower ECAR/OCR ratio than MDM ( p < 0.05) , but retain substantial glycolytic reserve. Compared to non-smokers , smokers ' AM demonstrate reduced metabolic activity , reduced glycolytic reserve ( p = 0.051) and reduced spare respiratory capacity ( p < 0.01). Following infection with Mtb , smokers ' AM have significantly reduced glycolytic response , as measured by extracellular flux analyses ( p < 0.05) and glycolytic gene expression analyses. CSE-treated MDM similarly demonstrate reduced metabolic activity and reserves , and impaired glycolytic response to infection. Human AM demonstrate metabolic plasticity that allows glycolytic reprogramming to occur following Mtb infection. In smokers , this metabolic reserve is significantly attenuated , with consequent impairment of the glycolytic response to infection.
