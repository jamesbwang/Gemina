 Naturally occurring mutations found in one of the two Ω-loop substructures in human cytochrome c are associated with low<symptom> blood platelet count ( thrombocytopenia<symptom>). Both Ω-loops participate in the formation of conformers associated with cytochrome c peroxidase activity and apoptotic function. At alkaline pH values , the Met80 ligand to the ferric heme iron dissociates , and a lysine residue in the 71-85 Ω-loop coordinates to the iron. The alkaline isomerization has been the focus of extensive kinetic studies , and it is established that a deprotonation triggers the release of the Met80 ligand ( p K
