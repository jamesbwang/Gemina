 The synthesized LaFeO ₃ nanocrystalline sensor powders show positive response to sensing acetone vapor at 200 & deg; C. The responses to acetone vapor ( at 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 ppm) are 1.18 , 1.22 , 1.89 , 3.2 and 7.83. To make the sensor operate at a lower optimum temperature , UV light illumination 365 nm is performed. Response of the sensor has a larger improvement under 365 nm UV light illumination than without it. The responses to acetone vapor ( at 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 ppm) are 1.37 , 1.85 , 3.16 , 8.32 and 14.1. Furthermore , the optimum operating temperature is reduced to 170 & deg; C. As the relative humidity increases , the resistance and sensitivity of sensor are reduced. The sensor shows good selectivity toward acetone when compared with other gases. Since the detection of ultralow concentrations of acetone vapor is possible , the sensor can be used to preliminarily judge diabetes in the general public , as a high concentration of acetone is exhaled in breath of diabetic patients. The sensor shows a good stability , which is further enhanced under UV light illumination. The sensor shows better stability when under 365 nm UV light illumination. Whether under light illumination or not. The LaFeO ₃ material shows good performance as a sensor when exposed to acetone vapor.
