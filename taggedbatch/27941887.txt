 Colorectal cancer is the fifth prevalent cancer in China. Nevertheless , a large-scale characterization of Chinese colorectal cancer mutation spectrum has not been carried out. In this study , we have performed whole exome-sequencing analysis of 98 patients ' tumor samples with matched pairs of normal colon tissues using Illumina and Complete Genomics high-throughput sequencing platforms. Canonical CRC somatic gene mutations with high prevalence ( > 10 %) have been verified , including
