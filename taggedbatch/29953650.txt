 Open surgery is the most commonly used methodological approach for generating a partial bladder outlet obstruction ( pBOO) animal model. Surgical suturing closing a part of the urethral meatus induces comparable pathophysiological changes in bladder and renal functions , but the optimum degree of obstruction that closely mimics the clinical pathology of pBOO has not been elucidated. We investigated the optimum obstruction level by performing a comprehensive time-dependent analysis of the stability and reliability of this novel animal model. Six- to eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were divided into three groups according to the degree of urethral meatus stricture ( UMS). Non-operated mice served as controls , and a pBOO model generated using the traditional method served as a positive control. A cystometric evaluation and long-term studies were performed to evaluate the validity and reliability of this novel animal model. An additional 35 mice were used to investigate the protein expression levels and histopathological features 24 h and 14 days postoperatively , respectively. The characteristic cystometry features in the UMS group revealed increased changes in pressure-related parameters compared with the control. The 1/3 UMS model is an optional pBOO animal model because the cystometric evaluation and histopathological studies revealed a striking resemblance between the 1/3 UMS model and the model generated using the traditional open-surgery method. The minimally invasive UMS model required less time and produced minimal alterations in pathophysiologically relevant processes compared with the traditional surgery model. Suturing to cause UMS produced effective and repeatable patterns in bladder function investigations in mice.
