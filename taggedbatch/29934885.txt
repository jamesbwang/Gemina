 Early detection of mild<symptom> pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH) based on clinical evaluation and echocardiography remains quite challenging. In addition to enhanced right ventricular ( RV) assessment , cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR) imaging may accurately reflect deleterious remodeling and increased stiffness of the central pulmonary arteries based on pulsatility , or percent change of the PA during the cardiac cycle. The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of measuring PA pulsatility by CMR as a potential early maker in PAH. We hypothesize that pulsatility may help discriminate mild PAH from normal control subjects. Consecutive patients with PAH ( n = 51) were prospectively enrolled to receive same day CMR and right heart catheterization ( RHC). PA stiffness indices including pulsatility , distensibility , compliance , and capacitance were calculated. Comparisons were made between patients with varying severities of PAH and normal controls ( n = 18). Of the 51 subjects , 20 had mild PAH , and 31 moderate-severe based on hemodynamic criteria. PA pulsatility demonstrated a progressive decline from normal controls ( 53 %) , mild PAH ( 22 %) , to moderate-severe PAH ( 17 %; p < 0.001). There was no difference in RV size , function or mass between mild PAH and normal controls. PA pulsatility below 40 % had an excellent ability to discriminate between mild PAH and normal controls with a sensitivity of 95 % and specificity of 94 %. CMR assessment of PA stiffness may noninvasively detect adverse pulmonary<disease> vascular remodeling and mild PAH , and thus be a valuable tool for early detection of PAH.
