 Multiple recent reports have indicated a rising awareness of trunnionosis-related implant failures , accounting for up to 3 % of all total hip arthroplasty revisions. Moreover , aseptic loosening and osteolysis from local release of metal debris can be the presenting manifestations , and thus the true incidence of trunnionosis is thought to be underreported. Furthermore , the relatively unclear and multifactorial pathogenesis and the widely variable clinical presentations pose a diagnostic challenge. A consensus regarding the ideal intervention and its timing is also lacking. Because of the relative paucity of reports regarding the diagnosis and management of trunnionosis , we conducted this evidence-based review to evaluate the ( 1) incidence , ( 2) pathogenesis , ( 3) diagnosis , and ( 4) treatment of trunnionosis in metal-on-polyethylene total hip arthroplasty. We then propose an algorithm for the diagnostic work-up and management of this condition.
