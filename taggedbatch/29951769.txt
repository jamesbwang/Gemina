 Tramadol is an analgesic with monoamine reuptake inhibition and μ-opioid receptor activation. Although tramadol has been widely used for treatment of various pain conditions , there is controversy over the risk of abuse potential. We examined the effects of tramadol on the reward system in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) to assess the potential of tramadol for drug abuse or dependence. A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study was conducted for 19 healthy adults under tramadol or placebo. In association with subjective mood questionnaires , monetary incentive delay ( MID) task was performed to assess the neural response to reward anticipation during fMRI. Subjective mood measures and blood oxygenation level-dependent ( BOLD) signal during gain and loss anticipation were compared between tramadol and placebo. Tramadol significantly reduced anxiety<symptom> ( Z =- 2.513 , p = 0.012) and enhanced vigor ( Z =- 2.725 , p = 0.006) compared with placebo. By Mood Rating Scale , tramadol provoked contented ( Z =- 2.316 , p = 0.021) , relaxed ( Z =- 2.236 , p = 0.025) , and amicable feelings ( Z =- 2.015 , p = 0.044) as well as increased alertness ( Z =- 1.972 , p = 0.049) and contentedness domains ( Z =- 2.174 , p = 0.030) compared with placebo. Several brain regions including nucleus accumbens ( NAc) were activated during gain anticipation in the MID task under both tramadol and placebo. Tramadol increased the % BOLD signal change in NAc at + ¥ 500 cue significantly more than the placebo ( Z =- 2.295 , p = 0.022). Tramadol enhances the reward system and thereby may have abuse potential or precipitate drug abuse in human.
