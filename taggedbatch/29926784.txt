 This study investigated whether adults ' ability to attribute emotions to brief facial expressions ( microexpressions) is associated with family-related environmental factors ( FrFs) such as one 's number of siblings ( Experiment 1) , attachment style ( Experiment 2) , or perceived parental authority style ( Experiment 3). Participants ' accuracy and reaction time ( RT) to the recognition of anger , contempt , disgust , fear , happiness , and sadness to facial microexpressions ( exposure: 100 ms) were measured with a six-alternative forced choice computerised method ( 6AFC). The attachment style and the authority style of the participants ' parents were accessed using questionnaires. The findings revealed that up to 13 % of the variance in participants ' responses could be explained by FrFs , with modest to moderate effect sizes. Microexpressions linked to signs of hostility or threat ( i.e. , contempt and fear) were decoded faster and/or more accurately by adults with few or no siblings or with a fearful attachment. Conversely , participants who recalled their fathers as authoritarian were worse at recognising contempt and fear than participants who perceived them as permissive or authoritative. The findings suggest that early FrFs may still be involved in the fine-tuning of responses to signs of contextual danger when the time for cognitive processing of facial expressions is severely restricted.
