 Drinking motives have shown meaningful associations with borderline personality disorder ( BPD) features. However , it is unknown whether other common substances of abuse ( namely cannabis and prescription opioids) have the same associations with BPD features. In the present study , we tested associations between BPD features and motives across three substances: alcohol , cannabis , and prescription opioids. The purpose of the study was to determine whether BPD showed similar patterns of associations across drugs , or whether some substances serve particular functions for individuals with BPD features , and whether this also varies by sex in a college student sample. Five-hundred ninety-four college students completed online questionnaires measuring demographics , borderline personality disorder features , substance use , and substance specific motives for alcohol , cannabis , and prescription opioid use. BPD was most strongly associated with coping motives across all substances. For both alcohol and cannabis , this was true for both males and females , along with conformity motives. For prescription opioids , coping , social , enhancement , and pain motives were only significantly related to BPD features for females. When compared statistically , it was found that the associations with coping drinking motives and opioid pain motives were higher among females. This pattern of results suggests that negatively reinforcing motives ( coping and conformity) play a similar functional role in borderline personality and substance use disorder pathology for alcohol and cannabis , but for prescription opioids the negative reinforcement motives ( coping and pain) were only evident in females.
