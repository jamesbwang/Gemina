 Social support in marriage may be associated with reduced risk for mental illness. Past studies are limited by short follow up and a focus on depression<symptom>. A two-wave nationally representative survey in the United States ( n = 2,503) is used to examine whether social support in marriage is associated with the onset of each of four clusters of disorders-internalizing , externalizing , phobic , and bipolar-10 years later. Results indicate that higher levels of perceived marital support were protective against internalizing , fear , and bipolar disorders , and against incident externalizing disorders for women. Protective effects of social support in marriage against mental illness are long-lasting , and sometimes differ by gender. Findings suggest the importance of mental health assessment in clinical practice.
