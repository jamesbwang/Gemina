 Recent studies showed that melanin-mimetic catechol-chitosan films are redox-active and their ability to exchange electrons confers pro-oxidant activities for the sustained , in situ generation of reactive oxygen species for antimicrobial bandages. Here we electrofabricated catechol-chitosan films , demonstrate these films are redox-active , and show their ability to exchange electrons confers sustained radical scavenging activities that could be useful for protective coatings. Electrofabrication was performed in two steps: cathodic electrodeposition of a chitosan film followed by anodic grafting of catechol to chitosan. Spectroelectrochemical reverse engineering methods were used to characterize the catechol-chitosan films and demonstrate the films are redox-active and can donate electrons to quench oxidative free radicals and can accept electrons to quench reductive free radicals. Electrofabricated catechol-chitosan films that were peeled from the electrode were also shown to be capable of donating electrons to quench an oxidative free radical , but this radical scavenging activity decayed upon depletion of electrons from the film ( i.e. , as the film became oxidized). However , the radical scavenging activity could be recovered by a regeneration step in which the films were contacted with the biological reducing agent ascorbic acid. These results demonstrate that catecholic materials offer important redox-based and context-dependent properties for possible applications as protective coatings.
