 Melanoma represents the most aggressive and the deadliest form of skin cancer. Current therapeutic approaches include surgical resection , chemotherapy , photodynamic therapy , immunotherapy , biochemotherapy , and targeted therapy. The therapeutic strategy can include single agents or combined therapies , depending on the patient 's health , stage , and location of the tumor. The efficiency of these treatments can be decreased due to the development of diverse resistance mechanisms. New therapeutic targets have emerged from studies of the genetic profile of melanocytes and from the identification of molecular factors involved in the pathogenesis of the malignant transformation. In this review , we aim to survey therapies approved and under evaluation for melanoma treatment and relevant research on the molecular mechanisms underlying melanomagenesis.
