 Biohazards and chemical hazards as well as radioactive hazards have always been a threat to human health. The search for solutions to these problems is an ongoing worldwide effort. In order to control biohazards by chemical methods , a synthetically useful fused tricyclic iodine-rich compound , 2,6-diiodo-3,5-dinitro-4,9-dihydrodipyrazolo ( 1,5- a: 5 ' ,1 '- d) ( 1,3,5) triazine ( 5) , with good detonation performance was synthesized , characterized , and its properties determined. This compound which acts as an agent defeat weapon has been shown to destroy certain microorganisms effectively by releasing iodine after undergoing decomposition or combustion. The small iodine residues remaining will not be deleterious to human life after 1 month.
