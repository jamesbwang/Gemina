 ABSTRACTAvailability of health professionals is fundamental to population health. Multiple trends contribute to provider shortages. Develop and validate conceptual models of early and involuntary retirement among registered nurses ( RNs) and allied health professionals ( AHPs). A review of retirement literature ( n = 23 studies). Any factor reported as predictive of early or involuntary retirement was incorporated into a model. To achieve face validity , we conducted interviews with Canadian RNs/AHPs ( n = 14). The conceptual model of early retirement had eight categories ( 38 variables): workplace characteristics , socio-demographics , attitudes/beliefs , broader context , organizational factors , family , lifestyle/health , and work-related. The model of involuntary retirement had four categories ( eight variables): broader context , socio-demographics , lifestyle/health , and family. Caregiving responsibilities ( variable) was added based on interview data. RNs/AHPs consider many factors when contemplating retirement; some are sensitive to intercession , which generates possibilities for extending the work lives of older RNs and AHPs.
