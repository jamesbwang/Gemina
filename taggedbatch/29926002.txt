 To investigate megakaryocyte ( MK) DNA ploidy in various hematological diseases , fluorescence microscopy imaging system ( FMI) can be used to analyze DNA ploidy with cell morphology at the single-cell level by using specialized image-processing software. Here we compared DNA ploidy obtained by FMI measured with that obtained flow cytometry ( FCM). With FMI , we could evaluate the DNA ploidy in long-term preserved bone<disease> marrow smear samples after staining. We next analyzed the MK DNA ploidy in 42 bone<disease> marrow smear samples including 26 myeloid neoplasm cases , and we compared the DNA ploidy and platelet counts in the patients ' peripheral blood; the production of platelets was significantly high compared to DNA ploidy in the myeloproliferative neoplasms group. The FMI method revealed that the patients with 5q- syndrome<disease><symptom> exhibited relatively low DNA ploidy despite high platelet counts , and this result suggested that increased DNA ploidy is not indispensable to abundant platelet production. The FMI method for DNA ploidy will be a useful tool to clarify the relationship between DNA ploidy and platelet production by MKs.
