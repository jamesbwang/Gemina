 The aim of this research was to evaluate the impact of a transgender simulation on nursing students ' affirmative practice when caring for a transgender person. There is a paucity of research that assesses the attitudes of nursing students toward lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT) persons and a deficit in nursing curricula regarding LGBT content. A nonexperimental , pretest-posttest design was used to evaluate nursing students ' affirmative practice when caring for a transgender patient using the Gay Affirmative Practice Scale. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed a statistical significance in Gay Affirmative Practice scores after the simulation with a small effect size. These results suggest that the transgender simulation supported nursing students ' attitudes and affirmative practice when providing nursing care to a transgender person. Experiential learning in nursing education is an effective approach to teach cultural competence and sensitivity in caring for vulnerable populations.
