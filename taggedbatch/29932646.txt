 Mapping of weak and hence transient interactions between low-abundance interacting molecules is still a major challenge in systems biology and protein biochemistry. Therefore , additional system-wide acting tools are needed to determine protein interactomics. Most important are reagents that can be applied at any kind of protein interface and the possibility to enrich cross-linked fragments with high efficiency. In this study , we report the synthesis of a novel noncanonical amino acid that features a diazirine group for ultraviolet cross-linking as well as an alkyne group for labeling by click chemistry. This bifunctional amino acid , called PrDiAzK , may be inserted into almost any protein interface with minimal structural perturbation using genetic code expansion. We demonstrate that PrDiAzK can be site-selectively incorporated into proteins in both bacterial and mammalian cell cultures , and we show that PrDiAzK allows protein labeling as well as cross-linking. In addition , we tested PrDiAzK for proteome-wide incorporation via stochastic orthogonal recoding of translation , implying potential applications in system-wide mapping of protein-protein interactions in the future.
