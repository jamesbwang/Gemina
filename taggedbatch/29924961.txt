 Angiogenic effects of epidermal growth factor ( EGF) , a potent mitogen , have been demonstrated previously. Moreover , different in vitro studies showed that EGF affects processes associated with bone healing , such as osteoblast differentiation and bone resorption. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of combined core decompression ( CD) and recombinant human EGF ( rhEGF) treatment on early-stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head ( ONFH) surgically induced in rats. ONFH was induced by dissecting the cervical periosteum and placing a ligature tightly around the femoral neck. Thirty rats were assigned to one of the following groups ( n = 10 each group): sham-operated control , CD , and CD + rhEGF group. rhEGF was injected intraosseously into infarcted areas 2 weeks after the surgery. Preservation of femoral head architecture was assessed at 8 weeks post treatment by radiographic and histomorphological analyses. Osteopontin ( OPN) and cluster of differentiation 31 ( CD31) were detected by immunochemistry , as indicators of bone remodeling and vascular density , respectively. Inter- and intra-group ( non-operated left and operated right femur) differences in radiographic and histomorphological results were analyzed. The femoral head area and sphericity were more preserved in CD + rhEGF compared to CD and sham-control group. CD31 levels were significantly different between the three groups , and were higher in CD + rhEGF compared to CD group. OPN levels were increased in CD and CD + rhEGF groups compared to sham control , but with no significant difference between CD and CD + rhEGF groups. Overall , our results indicate that EGF promotes bone formation and microvascularization in ONFH and thus positively affects the preservation of femoral head during healing.
