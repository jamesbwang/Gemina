 FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer is among the most popular tools to follow protein-protein interactions. Although limited to certain cases , site-specific fluorescent labeling of proteins via natural functions by means of chemical manipulations can redeem laborious protein engineering techniques. Herein we report on the synthesis of a heterobifunctional tag and its use in site-specific protein labeling studies aiming at exploring protein-protein interactions. The oxadiazole-methylsulfonyl functionality serves as a thiol specific warhead that enables easy and selective installation of fluorescent labels through a bioorthogonal motif. Mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK14) and its substrate mitogen activated protein kinase activated kinase ( MAPKAP2) or its docking motif , a 22 amino acid-long peptide fragment , were labeled with a donor and an acceptor , respectively. Evolution of strong FRET signals upon protein-protein interactions supported the specific communication between the partners. Using an efficient FRET pair allowed the estimation of dissociation constants for protein-protein and peptide-protein interactions ( 145 nM and 240 nM , respectively).
