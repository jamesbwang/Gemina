 We hypothesized that trends in total bilirubin in the context of cholecystitis<disease> and symptomatic cholelithiasis could be used to guide testing for the presence of common bile duct stones ( CBDS). A review of adult patients with acute cholecystitis<disease> or biliary colic<symptom> with elevated total bilirubin and at least two levels drawn prior to procedural intervention was performed. Trends of total bilirubin and other serum makers were examined to predict the presence of CBDS. The total bilirubin level at presentation , average over 24 h and average over 48 h ( 3.74 mg/dl vs. 2.29 mg/dl , p = 0.005; 3.72 mg/dl vs. 2.40 mg/dl , p = 0.009; 2.41 mg/dl vs. 1.47 mg/dl , p < 0.001) respectively , were all higher in those with CBDS. However , prediction was not improved by following levels over time. Patients presenting with elevated serum bilirubin , should undergo immediate imaging or procedural intervention rather than obtaining follow-up bilirubin levels.
