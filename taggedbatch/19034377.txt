 The right subclavian artery may originate from the left portion of the aortic arch. This aberrant vessel is known as the arteria lusoria. Its course to its usual site runs behind the esophagus , which may cause a disease known as dysphagia<symptom> lusoria , responsible for symptoms of discomfort. This artery is often associated with other anomalies , such as the non-recurrent laryngeal nerve and the bicarotid trunk , and with diseases such as aneurysms<disease> , congenital heart defects , and even genetic syndromes<disease><symptom>. During routine dissection of a male cadaver fixed in 10 % formalin solution , an arteria lusoria was found. This article reports the variation and discusses its embryological , clinical and surgical aspects.
