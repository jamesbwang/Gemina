 AMPK activated protein kinase ( AMPK) , a master regulator of energy homeostasis , is activated in response to an energy shortage imposed by physical activity and caloric restriction. We here report on the identification of PAN-AMPK activator O304 , which- in diet-induced obese mice- increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle , reduced β cell stress , and promoted β cell rest. Accordingly , O304 reduced fasting plasma glucose levels and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR) in a proof-of-concept phase IIa clinical trial in type 2 diabetes ( T2D) patients on Metformin. T2D is associated with devastating micro- and macrovascular complications , and O304 improved peripheral microvascular perfusion and reduced blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> both in animals and T2D patients. Moreover , like exercise , O304 activated AMPK in the heart , increased cardiac glucose uptake , reduced cardiac glycogen levels , and improved left ventricular stroke volume in mice , but it did not increase heart<symptom> weight in mice or rats. Thus , O304 exhibits a great potential as a novel drug to treat T2D and associated cardiovascular complications.
