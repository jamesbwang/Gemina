 Olfactory dysfunction is common in Parkinson 's disease ( PD). The characteristics of the hyposmia in PD have not been well defined. To characterize the pattern of the olfactory deficit in PD and in other non-neurodegenerative aetiologies of hyposmia. We evaluated 36 PD patients , 20 patients with hyposmia secondary to acute<pathogen><disease><symptom> respiratory<disease> infection<disease> ( ARI) , and 19 patients with hyposmia secondary to traumatic brain injury ( TBI). For comparison purposes , we included a group of 15 controls age and sex matched with PD patients. PD patients were classified based on disease duration and severity in de novo PD , and PD with and without chronic levodopa-related complications. The Barcelona Smell Identification Test was applied to all participants. For the first cranial<symptom> nerve odours , PD patients scored lower than controls on smell detection ( 85.28 vs. 97.67 % , p = 0.006) , definition ( 79.58 vs. 93.33 % , p = 0.007) , recognition ( 63.33 vs. 81 % , p = 0.020) , and forced choice ( 58.06 vs. 82 % , p < 0.001). Compared with ARI , forced choice was significantly better in PD patients ( p < 0.001) , but no differences were found regarding other olfactory characteristics. TBI patients showed significantly lower scores than the other study groups in all the olfaction items. For the fifth cranial<symptom> nerve odours , recognition ( p = 0.003) and identification ( p = 0.019) were lower in the TBI group than in the others. No differences were found among PD subgroups regarding any olfactory characteristic. A differential pattern of hyposmia was observed in PD patients compared to other non-neurodegenerative aetiologies. Further studies with larger samples should replicate our results.
