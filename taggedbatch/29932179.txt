 Covering: up to 2018α-Ketoglutarate ( αKG , also known as 2-oxoglutarate)- dependent mononuclear non-haem iron ( αKG-NHFe) enzymes catalyze a wide range of biochemical reactions , including hydroxylation , ring fragmentation , C-C bond cleavage , epimerization , desaturation , endoperoxidation and heterocycle formation. These enzymes utilize iron ( ii) as the metallo-cofactor and αKG as the co-substrate. Herein , we summarize several novel αKG-NHFe enzymes involved in natural product biosyntheses discovered in recent years , including halogenation reactions , amino acid modifications and tailoring reactions in the biosynthesis of terpenes , lipids , fatty acids and phosphonates. We also conducted a survey of the currently available structures of αKG-NHFe enzymes , in which αKG binds to the metallo-centre bidentately through either a proximal- or distal-type binding mode. Future structure-function and structure-reactivity relationship investigations will provide crucial information regarding how activities in this large class of enzymes have been fine-tuned in nature.
