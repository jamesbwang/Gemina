 This paper performs a comprehensive study on the computer-aided detection for the medical diagnosis with deep learning. Based on the region convolution neural network and the prior knowledge of target , this algorithm uses the region proposal network , the region of interest pooling strategy , introduces the multi-task loss function: classification loss , bounding box localization loss and object rotation loss , and optimizes it by end-to-end. For medical image it locates the target automatically , and provides the localization result for the next stage task of segmentation. For the detection of left ventricular in echocardiography , proposed additional landmarks such as mitral annulus , endocardial pad and apical position , were used to estimate the left ventricular posture<symptom> effectively. In order to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the algorithm , the experimental data of ultrasonic and nuclear magnetic resonance images are selected. Experimental results show that the algorithm is fast , accurate and effective.
