 Allergic contact dermatitis<disease> is a challenging diagnostic problem in children. Although epicutaneous patch testing is the diagnostic standard for confirmation of contact sensitization , it is less used in children by dermatologists treating children , pediatric dermatologists , and pediatricians , when compared with adult practitioners. The aim of the study was to create and evaluate standardization of a pediatric patch test series for children older than 6 years. We surveyed dermatologists and allergists conducting epicutaneous patch testing in children attending the 2017 American Contact Dermatitis Society meeting held in Washington , DC. This was followed by discussion of collected data and consensus review by a pediatric contact dermatitis<disease> working group at the conference. A baseline pediatric patch test panel was established through working group consensus.
