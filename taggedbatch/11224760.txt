 Vestibular schwannoma ( VS) is a slow-growing benign neoplasm. There has been an evolution in the management of VS from active treatments ( microsurgery and stereotactic radiotherapy) to conservative management ( wait and scan). Regular MRI scanning is necessary to monitor tumor progression. Conservative management causes significantly less complications and offers a higher quality of life compared with active treatments. The mean growth rate of VS varies from 0.4 to 2.9 mm/year , and spontaneous shrinkage is observed in 3.8 percent of tumors during observation. If significant growth occurs , active treatment is considered. Significant growth is defined as an increase of at least 3 mm in the largest extrameatal diameter in any plane between the first and last available scans. The vestibulocochlear nerve is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid , which provides natural contrast for MRI; thus , gadolinium may not be needed to detect VS. Specific sequences have high sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy for detection of progression. Hypointense signal in the ipsilateral inner ear fluid might be a useful sign to distinguish VS from meningioma. In this paper , we summarize the current status of research on conservative management and non-contrast MRI for the detection of VS.
