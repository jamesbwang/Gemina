 Prostate cancer ( PCa) is the most common malignancy and second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American men. Proliferating cells have higher need for nutrients and oxygen , triggering angiogenesis that plays a critical role in tumor growth , progression and metastasis. Consequently , immense focus has converged onto inhibitors of angiogenesis in cancer treatment , such as Nintedanib , which has shown exceptional antitumor activity via inhibiting cell proliferation and the resulting tumor growth , primarily due to its combined action on tumor cells , endothelial cells and pericytes. Accordingly , here we assessed both in vitro and in vivo efficacy of Nintedanib in PCa. The results showed that Nintedanib decreased cell viability in both androgen dependent- and- independent PCa cells , together with a decrease in cell motility and invasiveness. Nintedanib also reduced the expression of significant genes responsible for cell cycle progression. PCa PC3 xenograft-carrying nude mice treated with Nintedanib showed significantly decreased tumor volume and cell proliferation alongside diminished levels of pro-angiogenic molecules and blood vessel densities. In conclusion , we report that Nintedanib has strong efficacy against PCa in pre-clinical models via modulation of various pathways , and that it could be employed as a promising new strategy to manage PCa clinically.
