 We used intravital multiphoton microscopy to study the recovery of hepatobiliary metabolism following carbon tetrachloride ( CCl4) induced hepatotoxicity in mice. The acquired images were processed by a first order kinetic model to generate rate constant resolved images of the mouse liver. We found that with progression of hepatotoxicity , the spatial gradient of hepatic function disappeared. A CCl4-induced damage mechanism involves the compromise of membrane functions , resulting in accumulation of processed 6-carboxyfluorescein molecules. At day 14 following induction , a restoration of the mouse hepatobiliary function was found. Our approach allows the study of the response of hepatic functions to chemical agents in real time and is useful for studying pharmacokinetics of drug molecules through optical microscopic imaging.
