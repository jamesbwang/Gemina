 Improvement of cotton fibre yield and quality is challenging due to the narrow genetic base of modern cotton cultivars , which emphasizes the great need to effectively explore the existing germplasm resources. With major objective to assess the genetic diversity and population structure at DNA level , 302 elite upland cotton germplasm accessions ( 253 Chinese and 49 different exotic origins) , were genotyped using 198 simple sequence repeats ( SSRs) markers. Each of the 198 markers differed greatly in its ability to detect variations in the panel of cotton germplasm. The SSRs amplified 897 alleles , of which 77.7 % were polymorphic. The number of alleles varied from 2 to 12 ( mean 4.53). Gene diversity ranged from 0.020 to 0.492 with a mean of 0.279. The polymorphic information content ( PIC) values ranged from 0.371 to 0.019 ( mean 0.225). Genetic distances in the whole cotton germplasm ranged from 0.451 to 0.052 ( mean 0.270) , demonstrating relatively wider genetic diversity range. Chinese-origin cotton germplasm showed the highest level of SSR polymorphisms ( gene diversity = 0.268 , PIC = 0.218) , whereas American-origin revealed the highest mean genetic distance ( 0.274). Model-based Bayesian analysis clustered the whole cotton germplasm into three subpopulations , and the highest molecular variation ws revealed between subpopulations ( 4 % ,
