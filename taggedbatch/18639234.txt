 Major depressive disorder is a common comorbidity in migraineurs. Depression<symptom> may affect the progression and prognosis of migraine. Few studies have examined the brain function in migraineurs that may cause this comorbidity. Here , we aimed to explore depression-related abnormalities in the intrinsic brain activity of interictal migraineurs with comorbid depression<symptom> using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Significant main effects of migraine and depression<symptom> provided evidence that migraine and depression<symptom> jointly affected the left medial prefrontal cortex , which was thought to be the neural basis of self-referential mental activity in previous studies. Abnormalities in this region may contribute to determining the common symptoms of migraine and depression<symptom> and even result in comorbidity. Additionally , migraineurs with comorbid depression<symptom> had different developmental trajectories in the right thalamus and fusiform , which were associated with recognizing , transmitting , controlling and remembering pain and emotion. Based on our findings , the abnormal mPFC which may contribute to determining the common symptoms in migraine and depression<symptom> and may be a therapeutic target for migraineurs comorbid depression<symptom>. The different developmental trajectory in thalamus and fusiform indicates that the comorbidity may arise through a specific mechanism rather than simple superposition of migraine and depression<symptom>.
