 The protein coding genes ( rbcL/cbbL/cbbM) for RuBisCO large subunit , the most abundant protein on earth that drives biological CO2 fixation , were considered as useful marker genes in characterizing CO2-assimilating plankton. However , their community specificity has hindered comprehensive screening of genetic diversity. In this study , six different rbcL/cbbL/cbbM primers were employed to screen clone libraries to identify CO2-assimilating plankton in Jiaozhou Bay. The following community compositions were observed: the community components in Form I A/B rbcL/cbbL clone library mainly comprised Chlorophyta and Proteobacteria , Form ID2 and ID3 libraries consisted of Bacillariophyta , Form II cbbM library consisted of Proteobacteria and Alveolata , and both Form I green and red libraries included Proteobacteria , respectively. At the genus taxonomic level , no overlaps among these clone libraries were observed , except for ID2 and ID3. Overall , the phytoplankton in Jiaozhou Bay mainly consists of Bacillariophyta , Chlorophyta , Cryptophyta , Haptophyceae and Alveolata. The CO2-assimilating prokaryotes mainly consist of Proteobacteria. Considering the high-sequence specificities of these marker genes , we propose that the joint use of multiple primers may be utilized in unveiling the diversity of CO2-assimilating organisms. In addition , designing novel RuBisCO gene primers that generate longer amplicons and have broader phylogenetic coverage may be necessary in the future.
