 Co-evolution between pairs of residues in a multiple sequence alignment ( MSA) of homologous proteins has long been proposed as an indicator of structural contacts. Recently , several methods , such as direct-coupling analysis ( DCA) and MetaPSICOV , have been shown to achieve impressive rates of contact prediction by taking advantage of considerable sequence data. In this paper , we show that prediction success rates are highly sensitive to the structural definition of a contact , with more permissive definitions ( i.e. , those classifying more pairs as true contacts) naturally leading to higher positive predictive rates , but at the expense of the amount of structural information contributed by each contact. Thus , the remaining limitations of contact prediction algorithms are most noticeable in conjunction with geometrically restrictive contacts-precisely those that contribute more information in structure prediction. We suggest that to improve prediction rates for such `` informative '' contacts one could combine co-evolution scores with additional indicators of contact likelihood. Specifically , we find that when a pair of co-varying positions in an MSA is occupied by residue pairs with favorable statistical contact energies , that pair is more likely to represent a true contact. We show that combining a contact potential metric with DCA or MetaPSICOV performs considerably better than DCA or MetaPSICOV alone , respectively. This is true regardless of contact definition , but especially true for stricter and more informative contact definitions. In summary , this work outlines some remaining challenges to be addressed in contact prediction and proposes and validates a promising direction towards improvement.
