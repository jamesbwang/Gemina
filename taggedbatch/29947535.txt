 Renal medullary endothelin B receptors ( ET ( B)) mediate sodium excretion and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) control. Several animal models of hypertension have impaired renal medullary ET ( B) function. We found that 4-week high-caloric diet elevated systolic BP in Dahl salt-sensitive ( Dahl S) rats ( 126 +/ -2 vs. 143 +/ -3 mm Hg , p < 0.05). We hypothesized that renal medullary ET ( B) function is dysfunctional in DS rats fed a high-caloric diet. We compared the diuretic and natriuretic response to intramedullary infusion of ET ( B) agonist sarafotoxin 6c ( S6c) in DS rats fed either a normal or high-caloric diet for 4 weeks. Urine was collected during intramedullary infusion of saline for baseline collection followed by intramedullary infusion of either saline or S6c. We first examined the ET ( B) function in DS rats fed a normal diet. S6c increased urine flow ( 2.7 +/ -0.3 microl/min during baseline vs. 5.1 +/ -0.6 microl/min after S6c; p < 0.05; n = 5) and sodium excretion ( 0.28 +/ -0.05 vs. 0.81 +/ -0.17 micromol/min; p < 0.05) , suggesting that DS rats have renal medullary ET ( B) function. However , DS rats fed a high-caloric diet displayed a significant increase in urine flow ( 2.7 +/ -0.4 vs. 4.2 +/ -0.4 microl/min , baseline vs. S6c infusion , respectively; p < 0.05 , n = 6) , but no significant change in sodium excretion in response to S6c ( 0.32 +/ -0.06 vs. 0.45 +/ -0.10 micromol/min). These data demonstrate that renal medullary ET ( B) function is impaired in DS rats fed a high-caloric diet , which may be contributed to the elevation of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> during high-caloric feeding in this model.
