 Conflict between task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimulus information leads to impairment in response speed and accuracy. For instance , in the colour-word Stroop paradigm , participants respond slower and less accurately to the print colour of incongruent colour words ( e.g. , `` red '' printed in green) than to congruent colour words ( e.g. , `` green '' in green). Importantly , this congruency effect is diminished when the trials in an experiment are mostly incongruent , relative to mostly congruent , termed a proportion congruent effect. When distracting stimuli are mostly congruent in one context ( e.g. , location or font) but mostly incongruent in another context ( e.g. , another location or font) , the congruency effect is still diminished in the mostly incongruent context , termed a context-specific proportion congruent ( CSPC) effect. Both the standard proportion congruent and CSPC effects are typically interpreted in terms of conflict-driven attentional control , frequently termed conflict adaptation or conflict monitoring. However , in two experiments , we investigated contingency learning confounds in context-specific proportion congruent effects. In particular , two variants of a dissociation procedure are presented with the font variant of the CSPC procedure. In both , robust contingency learning effects were observed. No evidence for context-specific control was observed. In fact , results trended in the wrong direction. In all , the results suggest that CSPC effects may not be a useful way of studying attentional control.
