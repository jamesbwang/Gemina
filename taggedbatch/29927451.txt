 Two monomeric non-classical tellurium-containing heteropolymolybdate-supported metal carbonyl derivatives ( NH4) 5H3 ( ( Te2Mo12 ( OH) O44) ( Mn ( CO) 3)) · 18H2O ( 1) and ( NH4) 8 ( ( Te2Mo12 ( OH) O44) ( Re ( CO) 3)) · 13H2O ( 2) have been successfully isolated in good yields. Compounds 1 and 2 are the first two examples of metal carbonyl derivatives of heteromolybdate with tellurium as the central atom. These two compounds have been thoroughly characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction , elemental analyses , X-ray powder diffraction , Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , thermogravimetric analysis , and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The electrochemical catalytic activities of 1 and 2 including cyclic voltammetry and catalytic oxidation of nitrite have also been investigated.
