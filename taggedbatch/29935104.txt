 The management of fatigue<symptom> associated with chronic liver disease is a complex and major clinical challenge. Although fatigue<symptom> can complicate many chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , it is particularly common in diseases with an inflammatory component. Fatigue<symptom> can have both peripheral ( i.e. , neuromuscular) and central ( i.e. , resulting from changes in neurotransmission within the brain) causes. However , fatigue<symptom> in chronic liver disease has strong social/contextual components and is often associated with behavioural alterations including depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom>. Given the increasing awareness of patient-reported outcomes as important components of treatment outcomes and clinical research , there is a growing need to better understand and manage this poorly understood yet debilitating symptom. Although several pathophysiological mechanisms for explaining the development of fatigue<symptom> have been generated , our understanding of fatigue<symptom> in patients with chronic liver disease remains incomplete. A better understanding of the pathways and neurotransmitter systems involved may provide specific directed therapies. Currently , the management of fatigue<symptom> in chronic liver disease can involve a combined use of methods to beneficially alter behavioural components and pharmacological interventions , of which several treatments have potential for the improved management of fatigue<symptom> in chronic liver disease. However , evidence and consensus are lacking on the best approach and the most appropriate biochemical target ( s) whilst clinical trials to address this issue have been few and limited by small sample size. In this review , we outline current understanding of the impact of fatigue<symptom> and related symptoms in chronic liver disease , discuss theories of pathogenesis , and examine current and emerging approaches to its treatment.
