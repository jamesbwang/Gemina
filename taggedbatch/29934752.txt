 Cell surface membrane proteins comprise a wide array of structurally and functionally diverse proteins involved in a variety of important physiological and homeostatic processes. Complex integral membrane proteins , which are embedded in the lipid bilayer by multiple transmembrane-spanning helices , are represented by families of proteins that are important target classes for drug discovery. Such protein families include G-protein-coupled receptors , ion channels and transporters. Although these targets have typically been the domain of small-molecule drugs , the exquisite specificity of monoclonal antibodies offers a significant opportunity to selectively modulate these target proteins. Nevertheless , the isolation of antibodies with desired pharmacological functions has proved difficult because of technical challenges in preparing membrane protein antigens for antibody drug discovery. In this review , we describe recent progress in defining strategies for the generation of membrane protein antigens. We also describe antibody-isolation strategies that identify antibodies that bind the membrane protein and modulate protein function.
