 Alcohol use disorder ( AUD) is a strong risk factor for development and mortality of pneumonia<disease>. Mucociliary clearance , a key innate defense against pneumonia<disease> , is perturbed by alcohol use. Specifically , ciliated airway cells lose the ability to increase ciliary beat frequency ( CBF) to Î²-agonist stimulation after prolonged alcohol exposure. We previously found that alcohol activates protein phosphatase 1 ( PP1) through a redox mechanism to cause ciliary dysfunction. Therefore , we hypothesized that PP1 activity is enhanced by alcohol exposure through an S-nitrosothiol-dependent mechanism resulting in desensitization of CBF stimulation. Bronchoalveolar S-nitrosothiol ( SNO) content and tracheal PP1 activity was increased in wild-type ( WT) mice drinking alcohol for 6-weeks compared to control mice. In contrast , alcohol drinking did not increase SNO content or PP1 activity in nitric oxide synthase 3-deficient mice. S-nitrosoglutathione induced PP1-dependent CBF desensitization in mouse tracheal rings , cultured cells and isolated cilia. In vitro expression of mutant PP1 ( cysteine 155 to alanine) in primary human airway epithelial cells prevented CBF desensitization after prolonged alcohol exposure compared to cells expressing WT PP1. Thus , redox modulation in the airways by alcohol is an important ciliary regulatory mechanism. Pharmacologic strategies to reduce S-nitrosation may enhance mucociliary clearance and reduce pneumonia<disease> prevalence , mortality and morbidity with AUD.
