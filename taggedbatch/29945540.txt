 HIV<pathogen> disproportionately affects men who have sex with men ( MSM). Substance use is common among people living with HIV<pathogen> and may affect antiretroviral therapy adherence. Nevertheless , research examining the association between substance use and viral suppression is lacking. The aims of this study were to determine the association between substance use and self-reported viral suppression , and by age and race among MSM living with HIV<pathogen>. Data were obtained from 309 HIV-positive MSM. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between substance use and self-reported viral suppression at baseline , and by age and race. Approximately 67 % of participants reported they were virally suppressed. After adjusting for sociodemographics , every increase in substance use score was associated with a 7 % decrease in the odds of reporting viral suppression ( odds ratio ( OR): 0.93; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.89-0.98; p = 0.003). The negative association between substance use and self-reported viral suppression remained statistically significant among MSM aged 25-34 years ( OR = 0.89; 95 % CI: 0.79-1.00; p = 0.041) and statistically significant for Black MSM ( OR = 0.92; 95 % CI: 0.86-0.98; p = 0.009). Intervention programs for MSM living with HIV<pathogen> aimed at improving viral suppression should address substance use and consider the differences by age and race.
