 The presence of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus ( DM) substantially increases cardiovascular risk. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) decrease in these individuals is associated with large reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality , but the optimal BP levels in DM still remain a matter of important controversy. For almost 20 years , guidelines recommended an office BP target of < 130/80 mmHg in diabetic individuals , following evidence from trials randomizing patients to diastolic BP levels. When the action-to-control-cardiovascular-risk-in-diabetes-blood-pressure ( ACCORD-BP) study showed that systolic BP ( SBP) < 120 mmHg was associated with similar risk to SBP < 140 mmHg in type 2 DM , all guidelines stepped back to recommend a SBP < 140 mmHg , despite the obvious limitations of ACCORD-BP , including the surprisingly low event rate and the actual average BP of 133.5/ 70.5 mmHg in the `` standard-target '' arm. In contrast , the systolic-blood-pressure-intervention-trial ( SPRINT) showed cardiovascular benefits in hypertensive patients without DM randomized to SBP < 120 versus < 140 mmHg and many believed that absence of between-group differences in ACCORD-BP was rather a matter of power and not of dissimilar cardiovascular profile of diabetic patients. In this regard , the American-College-of-Cardiology/ American-Heart-Association 2017 BP guidelines advocated a BP target of < 130/80 in all hypertensives , including those with DM. However , the 2018 American-Diabetes-Association recommendations were not in the same direction , suggesting BP goal < 140/90 for most patients , with the exception of those with `` high cardiovascular risk '' , where a < 130/80 mmHg target may apply. This review presents the evidence from old and recent trials relevant to optimal BP levels in DM , aiming to shed light in this major clinical question.
