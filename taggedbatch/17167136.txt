 In the era of highly effective vaccines for Hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> A<pathogen><disease> Virus<pathogen> ( HAV<pathogen>) and Hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> Virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) , acute viral hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> in patients with a chronic liver disease remains a public health concern. Vaccination for HAV<pathogen> and HBV is endorsed by all liver society guidelines. The aim of our study was to determine the rates of immunization in an internal medicine resident clinic. We identified patients with a chronic liver disease seen at the University of Oklahoma Internal Medicine resident clinic between June 2014 and May 2015. ICD-9 code 571 was used to identify patients with a chronic liver disease. Vaccination records and patient data were reviewed. A total of 141 patients with a chronic liver disease ( mean age 54.1 years , 56 % males) were identified. Almost half of the patients ( 47.5 %) were also being seen in the gastroenterology clinic. During the internal medicine resident clinic visit , vaccination against HAV<pathogen> and HBV was addressed for 50 % and 46 % of the patients , respectively. Patients being seen by senior residents were more likely to be immunized against HAV<pathogen> ( OR 2.7 , p = 0.009) and HBV<pathogen> ( OR 2.1 , p = 0.03). Patients followed in the GI clinic were more likely to be immunized against HAV<pathogen> ( OR 2.1 , p = 0.02) and HBV<pathogen> ( OR 2.0 , p = 0.02). The gender of the treating physician and etiology had no impact on vaccination rates. Immunization rates for HAV<pathogen> and HBV remain subpar despite clear guidelines for patients with a chronic liver disease. This provides an important avenue for improvement. Different strategies , including resident education , developing vaccination protocols , and referral to the gastroenterology clinic , are likely to improve vaccination status for patients with chronic liver diseases.
