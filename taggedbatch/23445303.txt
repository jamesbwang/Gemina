 Malignant tumors contain heterogeneous populations of cells in various states of proliferation and differentiation. The presence of cancer stem or initiating cells is a well-established concept wherein quiescent and poorly differentiated cells within a tumor mass contribute to drug resistance , and under permissive conditions , are responsible for tumor recurrence and metastasis. A number of studies have identified molecular markers that are characteristic of tissue-specific cancer stem cells ( CSCs). Isolation of CSCs has enabled studies on the metabolic status of CSCs. As metabolic plasticity is a hallmark of cancer cell adaptation , the intricacies of CSC metabolism and their phenotypic behavior are critical areas of research. Unlike normal stem cells , which rely heavily on oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS) as their primary source of energy , or cancer cells , which are primarily glycolytic , CSCs demonstrate a unique metabolic flexibility. CSCs can switch between OXPHOS and glycolysis in the presence of oxygen to maintain homeostasis and , thereby , promote tumor growth. Here , we review key factors that impact CSC metabolic phenotype including heterogeneity of CSCs across different histologic tumor types , tissue-specific variations , tumor microenvironment , and CSC niche. Furthermore , we discuss how targeting key players of glycolytic and mitochondrial pathways has shown promising results in cancer eradication and attenuation of disease recurrence in preclinical models. In addition , we highlight studies on other potential therapeutic targets including complex interactions within the microenvironment and cellular communications in the CSC niche to interfere with CSC growth , resistance , and metastasis.
