 We present a case report of a three-year-old girl of Pakistani origin with coeliac disease. The first symptom was spontaneous fracture of the fibula. Vitamin D deficiency rickets and iron deficiency anaemia were demonstrated. An intestinal biopsy and elevated antibody levels confirmed the coeliac disease. Rickets is a known but rare presentation of coeliac disease , but this case report illustrates , how coeliac disease in children often presents with non-gastrointestinal symptoms. The importance of investigations for malabsorp-tion , if iron deficiency is not easily corrected with sufficient iron supplements , is underlined as well as the importance of screening for coeliac disease.
