 Diabetics are at increased risk after stent implantation and potentially sensitive to the type of stent and dual anti-platelet therapy ( DAPT). The randomized , double-blind LEADERS FREE trial compared 2432 patients at high bleeding risk ( HBR) receiving either a polymer-free BA9-coated stent ( DCS) or a bare metal stent ( BMS) with 1 month of DAPT , and showed superior safety and efficacy of the DCS at 2 years. We report outcomes at 2 years of the pre-specified diabetic subgroup. The diabetic sub-group comprised 805 ( 33.1 %) patients; 262 ( 10.8 %) were insulin-dependent ( IDDM). Compared to non-diabetics , diabetics were younger and had more risk factors and multi-vessel disease. They suffered higher rates of death ( 15.6 vs. 12.2 % , p = 0.01) , cardiac death ( 8.3 vs. 5.9 % , p = 0.02) , myocardial infarction ( MI) ( 11.1 vs. 7.8 % , p = 0.009) and definite/probable stent thrombosis ( 3.1 vs. 1.7 % , p = 0.01) , but rates of clinically-indicated TLR ( 9.1 vs. 9.5 % , p = 0.93) and BARC 3-5 bleeding ( 10.2 vs. 8.4 % , p = 0.20) were comparable. Compared to diabetic patients treated with a BMS , diabetic DCS recipients required less clinically driven TLR ( 6.3 vs. 12.2 % , p = 0.006). The primary safety endpoint ( cardiac death , MI , definite/probable stent thrombosis) occurred numerically less frequently in the DCS group ( 14.9 vs. 19.7 % , p = 0.10) , and was significantly lower in IDDM patients ( 13.8 vs. 25.4 % , p = 0.03). BARC 3-5 was similar for patients treated with DCS ( 9.9 %) and BMS ( 10.5 % , p = 0.84). In diabetic HBR patients , DCS significantly reduced re-intervention rates over BMS , and showed a strong trend towards a safety benefit at 2 years. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01623180.
