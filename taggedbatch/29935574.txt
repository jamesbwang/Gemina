 General anaesthesia should prevent patients from experiencing surgery , defined as connected consciousness<symptom>. The isolated forearm technique ( IFT) is the current gold standard for connected consciousness<symptom> monitoring. We evaluated the efficacy of different anaesthesia regimens in preventing IFT responses. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of studies evaluating IFT in adults. Proportions of IFT-positive patients were compared for inhalational versus intravenous anaesthesia and anaesthesia brain monitor ( ABM)- guided versus non-ABM-guided. Of 1131 patients in 22 studies , 393 ( 34.8 %) had an IFT response during induction or maintenance. IFT-positive patients were less frequent during induction ( 19.7 % ( 95 % CI , 17.5-22.1)) than during maintenance ( 31.2 % ( 95 % CI , 27.8-34.8)). Proportions of IFT-positive patients during induction and maintenance were similar for inhalational ( 0.51 ( 95 % CI , 0.38-0.65)) and intravenous ( 0.52 ( 95 % CI , 0.26-0.77)) anaesthesia , but during maintenance were lower with inhalational ( 0.18 ( 95 % CI , 0.08-0.38)) than with intravenous ( 0.48 ( 95 % CI , 0.24-0.73)) anaesthesia. Proportions of IFT-positive patients during induction and maintenance were not significantly different for ABM-guided ( 0.64 ( 95 % CI , 0.39-0.83)) and non-ABM-guided ( 0.48 ( 95 % CI , 0.34-0.62)) anaesthesia but during maintenance were lower with non-ABM-guided ( 0.19 ( 95 % CI , 0.09-0.37)) than with ABM-guided ( 0.57 ( 95 % CI , 0.34-0.77)). Proportions of IFT-positive patients decreased significantly with increasing age and premedication use. Of the 34 anaesthesia regimens , 16 were inadequate. Studies had low methodological quality ( only seven randomised controlled trials) and significant heterogeneity. Standard general anaesthesia regimens might not prevent connected consciousness<symptom>. More accurate anaesthesia brain monitor methodology to reduce the likelihood of connected consciousness<symptom> is desirable.
