 Peripheral T cell lymphoma ( PTCL) is a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative neoplasms , with at least 29 distinct entities described in current WHO classification. Using present diagnostic approaches , more than a third of PTCL cases can not be classified , hence designated as PTCL-not otherwise specified ( PTCL-NOS). Herein , we summarize the current genomic findings and their role in the molecular pathogenesis in different PTCL entities. Gene expression profiling ( GEP) studies have identified distinct molecular signatures for accurate diagnosis and elucidated oncogenic pathways enriched in major PTCL entities. Furthermore , genomic characterization has identified recurrent somatic mutations and potential therapeutic targets. Further efforts are underway to develop genetically faithful murine models. GEP studies have identified molecular subgroups of PTCL , characterized by distinct genetic and epigenetic alterations. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of T cell lymphomagenesis using in vivo model will help to reveal novel therapeutic targets.
