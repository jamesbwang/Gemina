 Acute<symptom> pulmonary oedema is a serious complication of preeclampsia. Early detection of pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> in preeclampsia would improve fluid management and would also allow earlier detection of severe cases. The aim of this work is to evaluate the ability of thoracic fluid content measured by electrical cardiometry for early detection of pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> in parturients with preeclampsia. A prospective observational study included a cohort of preeclamptic parturients. On admission , lung ultrasound score was calculated , and thoracic fluid content was recorded using electrical cardiometry ICON device. Area under receiver operating characteristic ( AUROC) curve was calculated for lung ultrasound score , thoracic fluid content for detection of pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom>. Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated for correlation between lung ultrasound score and thoracic fluid content. Sixty patients were included in the study; of them , 6 patients ( 10 %) required diuretics for pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom>. Patients with pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> had higher lung ultrasound score and thoracic fluid content compared to other patients. Good correlation was reported between Lung ultrasound score and thoracic fluid content ( r = 0.82). Thoracic fluid content and lung ultrasound score showed excellent diagnostic properties for pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> ( AUROC: 0.941 ( 0.849-0.986) , best cut-off value: 40 k ohm
