 Little is known about the cross talk between the lignin biosynthesis gene promoters and the regulatory proteins that modulate molecular signaling and respond to various stresses. In this study , we characterized the promoter region of the lignin biosynthesis pathway cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase ( CAD) gene in elephant grass , Pennisetum purpureum. Quantification of the transcript levels of the PpCAD promoter revealed it is preferentially expressed in vascular tissue , especially xylem. Histochemical and fluorometric assays confirmed the vascular-preferential expression of the PpCAD promoter , as the highest Î²-glucuronidase ( GUS) activity was found in the basal stem in transgenic tobacco plants expressing a 1154-bp PpCAD promoter-GUS fusion construct. Moreover , 5 '- deleted PpCAD promoter analyses showed that the 1154-bp PpCAD promoter fragment had the highest transcriptional activity , whereas the 2054-bp fragment had multifarious inducible activity responding to gibberellin ( GA) , methyl jasmonate ( MeJA) , abscisic acid ( ABA) , and wounding. The regions from -248 to -243 bp and -1416 to -1411 bp contained W-box cis-elements , which were detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA). The binding effects of the GA-responsive elements ( from -561 to -555 bp and -1077 to -1071 bp) , MeJA-responsive element ( from -1146 to -1142 bp) , and the ABA-responsive cis-element ( from -1879 to -1874 bp) were also validated by EMSA. Based on our results , we suggest that lignin deposition associated with PpCAD promoter activity adapts to the environment through molecular signaling involving GA , MeJA , and ABA.
