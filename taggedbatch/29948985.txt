 Continuous manufacturing , a gaining interest paradigm in the pharmaceutical industry , requires in-process monitoring of critical process parameters to ensure product consistency. This study demonstrated the application of Fourier transform near-infrared ( FT-NIR) spectroscopy in conjunction with chemometrics modeling for in-line hot melt extrusion process monitoring. The obtained results suggested that inline FT-NIR analysis , along with a tailored NIR reflector , is a viable process analytical tool to monitor active pharmaceutical ingredient concentration as well as processing parameters.
