 BACKGROUND Factor VII-activating protease ( FSAP) has a role in vascular inflammation<symptom> and may have a role coronary artery disease ( CAD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between two naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) in the FSAP gene and the risk of coronary artery disease ( CAD). MATERIAL AND METHODS Of 733 patients , 173 patients had symptoms of angina , and 560 patients had CAD confirmed by coronary angiography. All patients were genotyped for SNPs of the FSAP gene , Marburg<pathogen><disease> I ( MI-SNP) and Marburg<pathogen><disease> II ( MII-SNP) , using 5 ' exonuclease TaqMan assays. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between two gene polymorphisms , metabolic and other cardiovascular risk factors in patients with CAD. RESULTS The presence of MI-SNP and MII-SNP FSAP gene polymorphisms were not associated with the presence of CAD. However , the MII-SNP polymorphism was significantly associated with a reduced risk of developing CAD ( OR = 0.422; 95 % CI , 0.194-0.920; P = 0.035); the MI-SNP polymorphism was associated with absence of hyperlipoproteinemia ( OR = 0.601; 95 % CI , 0.344-1.051; P = 0.074). There was no significant association between expression of the MI-SNP and MII-SNP FSAP gene polymorphisms and the incidence of myocardial infarction , or of a history of diabetes mellitus , arterial hypertension , obesity , or smoking. CONCLUSIONS The MI-SNP and MII-SNP FSAP gene polymorphisms were not predictive or prognostic biomarkers for CAD or its main risk factors. However , the presence of the MII-SNP polymorphism was associated with a reduced risk of developing CAD.
