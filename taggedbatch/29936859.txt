 Semmelweis finally achieved results from his persistent research work. Those being the scientific analysis of clinical statistical data and his animal experiments , which recognized the dreadful disease of puerperal fever<symptom> and its prevention. `` He not only discovered the real cause of puerperal fever<symptom> but he also created antiseptic prophylaxis , which he introduced in obstetrics and laid the foundations of modern surgery ( asepsis). The theory and practice of asepsis stemmed from the discovery of the etiology of puerperal fever<symptom> and therefore originating from the genius idea of Semmelweis. The discoveries of bacteriology by Lister , Pasteur and Koch only provided a scientific proof of the intuitive statements of Semmelweis. '' Semmelweis was a pioneer of clinical etiological research whose findings were aggressively disapproved by his colleagues due to earlier medical misunderstandings. Semmelweis is given due respect by posterity as a remuneration , to all the bitterness that he had suffered throughout his life. Semmelweis is considered the savior of mothers and infants. The Hungarian nation is very proud of him as he is one of our models whose oeuvre is acknowledged not only in Hungary but throughout the world. The message of his short , tragic yet effective life is eternal. The figure of Ignác Semmelweis is depicted as a statue and is placed in Chicago among the statues of the most innovative doctors and health care professionals of the world. The statue of Semmelweis is next to the statues of Louis Pasteur and Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen. `` Semmelweis reflex '' is a new expression which appeared and spread in English speaking countries. The word does not relate to a medical phenomenon but describes a social phenomenon when experts or the whole society automatically rejects discoveries and new recognitions without examination or justification. This phenomenon frequently occurs , even in our times. Orv Hetil. 2018; 159 ( 26): 1041-1054.
