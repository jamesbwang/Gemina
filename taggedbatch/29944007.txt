 This review describes the historical development of an imageable spherical embolic agent and focuses on work performed in collaboration between Biocompatibles UK Ltd ( a BTG International group company) and the NIH to demonstrate radiopaque bead utility and bring a commercial offering to market that meets a clinical need. Various chemistries have been investigated and multiple prototypes evaluated in search of an optimized product with the right balance<symptom> of handling and imaging properties. Herein , we describe the steps taken in the development of DC Bead LUMI â„¢ , the first commercially available radiopaque drug-eluting bead , ultimately leading to the first human experience of this novel embolic agent in the treatment of liver tumors.
