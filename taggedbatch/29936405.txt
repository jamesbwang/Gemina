 A micro-mesoporous activated carbon ( AC) was produced via an innovative approach combining microwave pyrolysis and chemical activation using NaOH/KOH mixture. The pyrolysis was examined over different chemical impregnation ratio , microwave power , microwave irradiation time and types of activating agents for the yield , chemical composition , and porous characteristic of the AC obtained. The AC was then tested for its feasibility as textile dye adsorbent. About 29 wt % yield of AC was obtained from the banana peel with low ash and moisture ( < 5 wt %) , and showed a micro-mesoporous structure with high BET surface area ( â‰¤ 1038 m
