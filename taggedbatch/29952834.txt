 To summarize recent findings from the application of MRI in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis ( MS) , and to review the insights into disease pathophysiology and the utility of MRI for monitoring treatment response. New evidence from the application of MRI in patients with clinically isolated syndromes<disease><symptom> has guided the 2017 revision of the McDonald criteria for MS diagnosis , which has simplified their clinical use while preserving accuracy. Other MRI measures ( e.g. , cortical lesions<symptom> and central vein signs) may improve diagnostic specificity , but their assessment still needs to be standardized , and their reliability confirmed. Novel MRI techniques are providing fundamental insights into the pathological substrates of the disease and are helping to give a better understanding of its clinical manifestations. Combined clinical-MRI measures of disease activity and progression , together with the use of clinically relevant MRI measures ( e.g. , brain atrophy) might improve treatment monitoring , but these are still not ready for the clinical setting. Advances in MRI technology are improving the diagnostic work-up and monitoring of MS , even in the earliest phases of the disease , and are providing MRI measures that are more specific and sensitive to disease pathological substrates.
