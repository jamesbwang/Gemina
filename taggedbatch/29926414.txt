 The antibody preparation method to the glycolipid is basically same to the method to the protein. However , because the immunogenicity of the carbohydrate moieties of glycolipid is generally low in the mouse , the development of the anti-glycolipid antibody using purified glycolipid as an immunogen was not yet established. Here , we describe a method using a purified ganglioside adsorbed onto Salmonella minnesota for the efficient production of an anti-ganglioside mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes the carbohydrate moieties of the ganglioside.
