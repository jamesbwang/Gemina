 To assess the effectiveness of the implementation of a protocol for glycaemic control in critical care , in terms of maintenance of a pre-established target of blood glucose level , reduction of hyperglycaemia and prevention of severe hypoglycaemia. Prospective `` pre-post '' quasi-experimental study carried out in a general critical care unit. Adult patients treated with intravenous insulin were included. We recorded all glycaemic tests performed from November 2014 to August 2015 ( pre-intervention) and from November 2015 to August 2016 ( post-intervention). The intervention consisted of the implementation of an evidence-based glycaemic control protocol to achieve glycaemic levels in a range of 140-180mg/ dl. Main variables analysed were: proportion of glycaemic tests in the target range , proportions of severe hypoglycaemia ( under 40mg/dl) and hyperglycaemia over 200mg/dl. We analysed 7864 glycaemic tests from 125 patients , 66 pre-intervention and 59 post-intervention. Average age was 66.24 Â± 13.99 years , 64 % of patients were male. The proportion of tests within the target range was higher in the intervention group ( 38.82 vs. 44.34 p < .001). Only one case of severe hypoglycaemia was identified , which happened in the pre-intervention period. The rate of severe hyperglycaemia was lower in the post-intervention group ( 19.19 vs. 16.28 p = .001). Our experience shows that implementation of evidence-based interventions can improve glycaemic control during critical illness. We found higher glycaemia levels in the target range. The protocol proved useful in the prevention of severe hypoglycaemia. Nurse-led interventions based on clinical data improved health results in our patients.
