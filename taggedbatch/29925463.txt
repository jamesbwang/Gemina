 Men who have sex with men ( MSM) are at elevated risk for sexually transmissible infection ( STI) acquisition globally. Yet , limited research has explored STI testing practices among MSM in contexts where same-sex practices are criminalised , such as in Jamaica. A cross-sectional , tablet-based survey with MSM in Kingston , Ocho Rios and Montego Bay , Jamaica , was conducted. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the adjusted risk ratio for lifetime STI testing and lifetime STI diagnosis. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the relative odds of having had an STI test 3-5 months ago and 6-12 months ago in comparison with < 3 months ago. Three-quarters ( 74.8 %) of the 556 participants reported receiving an STI test ( 44 % < 3 months ago; 32 % 3-5 months ago; 13 % 6-12 months ago; 10 % > 12 months ago); 12.1 % reported ever receiving an STI diagnosis. In adjusted multivariable analyses , STI testing was associated with sociodemographic ( education , location) , individual ( depression<symptom> , perceived risk) , social ( relationship status , sexual stigma) and structural ( healthcare provider access) factors. In multinomial analysis , reporting a less recent STI test ( Findings document associations between structural factors and delayed timing of STI testing. Further research is necessary to explore how to address social ecological factors in sexual health interventions with MSM in Jamaica.
