 A novel protease was isolated from Coprinopsis<pathogen> atramentaria , which is , to our knowledge , the first macromolecule to be purified from this species. The protease , referred to as CAP , was purified through the use of ion exchange chromatography on sulphopropyl-sepharose , diethylaminoethyl-cellulose , Q-Sepharose , and gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column. CAP is a monomelic protein with a molecular mass of 32 kDa. The maximum activity of CAP was detected at pH 7.0 and 50 °C. The preferred pH of CAP demonstrated that it was a neutral protease. Kinetic constants were determined under optimal reaction conditions , using 1 % casein as the substrate. We found Km and Vmax values of 7.98 mg · mL-1 and 215 μg · mL-1 · min-1 , respectively. Among the various metal ions tested , Pb2 + , Zn2 + , Mn2 + , Hg2 + , Cu2 + , and Cd2 + exerted dose-dependent inhibitory actions , whereas Mg2 + exhibited a promoting action at all concentrations tested. Eight inner peptide sequences were detected by liquid chromatography on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer and were identified using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool , which contains proteases from other sources. Alignment results showed that 2 of them were homologous to fungal cysteine proteases. The other 5 peptide sequences also shared similarities with proteases of other origins. The isolation of a novel protease from C. atramentaria in this study not only expands the sources of proteases but also provides further information about this fungus.
