 Advanced maternal age ( AMA) is associated with increased risk for preeclampsia , however , a paucity of data exists regarding the characteristics of the disease in this age group. Our aim was to compare the characteristics and severity of preeclampsia in older and younger gravidas. A retrospective , small case control study of women diagnosed with preeclampsia in a single tertiary care center. Nulliparous women ≥ 40 years old with singleton pregnancies ≥ 24 0/7 weeks ' gestation were matched ( 1:2 ratio) with young ( 20-34 years old) nulliparous women. The rate of severe preeclampsia ( 60.9 vs 69.6 % respectively) , HELLP , eclampsia or the need for magnesium treatment did not differ between the groups. However , the AMA group had an increased rate of postpartum presentation or exacerbation of preeclampsia compared to the control group ( 50.0 vs. 28.3 % respectively , p = 0.01). In the AMA group , 93.5 % of births were by cesarean section ( CS) compared to 52.2 % in the control group ( p < 0.0001). There was no difference in birthweight , rate of small for gestational age or composite neonatal morbidity between the groups. Preeclampsia at an advanced maternal age carries a similar rate of severe preeclampsia and complications as in young women. However , women over 40 years old have an increased risk for presentation or exacerbation of preeclampsia in the postpartum period and an increased rate of CS compared to younger gravidas.
