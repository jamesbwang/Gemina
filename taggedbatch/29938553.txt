 Acral lentiginous melanoma is the most common subtype among melanomas on the foot. Reconstruction of a wide surgical defect once it is excised may result in a challenge that requires replacing the lost tissue with another tissue having similarly unique physical characteristics. Although reconstructive options such as skin grafts and either local or distant flaps offer adequate coverage , they often are subject of contraction , muscle atrophy , and contour abnormalities. Dermal substitutes provide support and structure and recreates the dermal layer to ensure a durable reconstruction. We report 2 cases of plantar melanoma in which adequate reconstruction was achieved using a dermal substitute.
