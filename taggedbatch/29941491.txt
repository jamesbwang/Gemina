 Accurate chromosome segregation is a fundamental process in cell biology. During mitosis , chromosomes are segregated to daughter cells through interactions between centromeres and microtubules in the mitotic spindle. Centromere domains have evolved to nucleate formation of the kinetochore , which is essential for establishing connections between chromosomal DNA and microtubules during mitosis. Centromeres are typically formed on highly repetitive DNA that is not conserved in sequence or size among organisms and can differ substantially between individuals within the same organism. However , transcription of repetitive DNA has emerged as a highly conserved property of the centromere. Recent work has shown that both , the topological effect of transcription on chromatin and the nascent non-coding RNAs , contribute to multiple aspects of centromere function. In this review , we discuss the fundamental aspects of centromere transcription , its dual role in chromatin remodeling/CENP-A deposition and kinetochore assembly during mitosis , from a cell cycle perspective.
