 The existing four-week pre-exposure rabies<pathogen> vaccination schedule is costly and often not practicable. Shorter effective schedules would result in wider acceptance. We conducted a non-inferiority trial in 500 healthy adults comparing the safety and immunogenicity of a two-visit ( day 0 and day 7) intradermal ( ID) primary vaccination ( two doses of 0.1 ml ID of the human diploid cell culture rabies<pathogen> vaccine ( HDCV) at day 0 and 7) versus a standard three-visit schedule ( single dose of 0.1 mL ID at day 0 , 7 , and 28). One to three years after primary vaccination , a single booster dose of 0.1 mL ID of HDCV was given to evaluate the anamnestic rabies<pathogen> antibody response. The primary endpoint for immunogenicity was the percentage of subjects with an adequate antibody level > 0.5 IU/mL seven days after the booster injection. The safety endpoint was the proportion of participants developing adverse reactions following the primary vaccination and/or booster dose. All subjects in both study groups possessed a rabies<pathogen> antibody titer > 0.5 IU/mL on day 7 following the booster dose. Following the booster dose , subjects exposed to the double-dose two-visit ID schedule had a geometric mean titer of 37 IU/ml versus 25 IU/ml for the single-dose three-visit schedule ( p < 0.001). Local reactions at the injection site following primary vaccination were mild and transient. In healthy adults , ID administration of a double dose of 0.1 ml of HDCV over two-visits ( day 0 and day 7) was safe and not inferior to the single-dose three-visit schedule.
