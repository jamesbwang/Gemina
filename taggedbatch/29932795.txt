 In efforts to speed up the assessment of microorganisms , researchers have sought to use bacteriophages as a biosensing tool , due to their host-specificity , wide abundance , and safety. However , the lytic cycle of the phage has limited its efficacy as a biosensor. Here , we cloned a fragment of tail protein J from phage lambda and characterized its binding with the host , E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> K-12 , and other microorganism. The N-terminus of J was fused with a His-tag ( 6HN-J) , overexpressed , purified , and characterized using anti-His monoclonal antibodies. The purified protein demonstrated a size of ∼ 38 kDa upon SDS-PAGE and bound with the anti-His monoclonal antibodies. ELISA , dot blot , and TEM data revealed that it specifically bound to E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> K-12 , but not to Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen>. The observed protein binding occurred over a concentration range of 0.01-5 μg/ml and was found to inhibit the in vivo adsorption of phage to host cells. This specific binding was exploited by surface plasmon resonance ( SPR) to generate a novel 6HN-J-functionalized SPR biosensor. This biosensor showed rapid label-free detection of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> K-12 in the range of 2 × 10
