 A major feature of type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM) is hyperglycemia and dysfunction of pancreatic β-cells. In a previous study , we have shown that Tat-DJ-1 protein inhibits pancreatic RINm5F β-cell death caused by oxidative stress. In this study , we examined effects of Tat-DJ-1 protein on streptozotocin ( STZ)- induced diabetic mice. Wild type ( WT) Tat-DJ-1 protein transduced into pancreas where it markedly inhibited pancreatic β-cell destruction and regulated levels of serum parameters including insulin , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) , and free fatty acid ( FFA) secretion. In addition , transduced WT Tat-DJ-1 protein significantly inhibited the activation of NF-κB and MAPK ( ERK and p38) expression as well as expression of COX-2 and iNOS in STZ exposed pancreas. In contrast , treatment with C106A mutant Tat-DJ-1 protein showed no protective effects. Collectively , our results indicate that WT Tat-DJ-1 protein can significantly ameliorate pancreatic tissues in STZ-induced diabetes in mice. ( BMB Reports 2018; 51 ( 7): 362-367).
