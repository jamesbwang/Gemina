 The molecular machinery linking macroautophagy ( autophagy hereafter) to apoptosis is still being elucidated. A recent study found that the transcription factor FOXO3/FOXO3A ( forkhead box O3) , which regulates autophagy , is itself regulated by basal autophagy to determine apoptosis sensitivity. Autophagy inhibition confers cell sensitivity to anti-cancer agents , and this effect is explained by the ability of FOXO3 to transactivate the pro-apoptotic gene BBC3/PUMA. Here , we discuss the possibility that FOXO3 acts as a cell surveillance mechanism to correct autophagy perturbations ( i.e. , autophagy inhibition) , and confers apoptosis sensitization if this autophagy imbalance is not rectified.
