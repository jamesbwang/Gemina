 Bud-break assays under forced growth conditions suggest that a drop in ABA content and an increase in sugars are common features in the sprouting of paradormant ( PD) and endodormant ( ED) grapevine buds. However , increases in cell division and in respiration<symptom> are unique characteristics of the ED budding. In tropical and subtropical regions where the variations in day length and temperatures are minor throughout the year , the rupture of grapevine buds can be achieved during the current growing season given rise to a double-cropping system annually. However , it is unknown whether the breaking buds are in the paradormancy ( PD) or endodormancy ( ED) stage. In this study , we compared the breakage of PD and ED buds under conditions of forced growth. To do this , the expression of genes related to the metabolism of phytohormones and sugars , and of relevant physiological functions such as respiration<symptom> and cell division was analyzed temporally throughout the incubation period in both types of buds. An early fall in the expression of the ABA biosynthesis gene ( VvNCED1) and increases in genes related to sugar metabolism and transports were observed during the incubation period in both types of buds. However , while in the PD buds , the genes related to respiration<symptom> and the cell cycle did not undergo significant changes in their expression during the incubation period , in the ED buds , the expression of these genes together with those related to auxin and cytokinin biosynthesis experienced a large increase. The results suggest that a drop in ABA content and an increase in sugars are early signals for the onset of bud break in both PD and ED vines , while the increase in respiration<symptom> and cell division are unique characteristics of the ED buds , which reflect its transition from a resting state to a state of active growth.
