 Background Oxidative stress is strongly implicated in ischemia reperfusion ( IR)- mediated functional and neuronal impairment. Therefore , strategies employing antioxidants to reverse the damage due to IR are being investigated. Allium schoenoprasum L. is a culinary medicine whose antioxidant properties are well documented but whose neuroprotective potential has not been examined. Hence , the present study was designed to evaluate the effect of A. schoenoprasum leaf extract ( ASLE) on functional deficit against IR-induced cerebral injury in mice. Methods Acute toxicity studies of ASLE were performed following the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Guideline 423. IR injury was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion ( BCCAO) for 15 min followed by 24-h reperfusion. Animals were treated for 7 days with ASLE ( 200 and 400 mg/kg , p.o. once daily) after IR injury. Functional outcomes ( memory and sensorimotor functions) were measured using Morris water maze and neurological severity score , respectively. Cerebral infarct size and oxidative stress ( thiobarbituric acid reactive species ( TBARS) , reduced glutathione ( GSH) , and superoxide dismutase ( SOD) activity) were measured in order to elucidate the neuroprotective mechanism of ASLE. Results No toxic effects of ASLE were observed in mice. Oral treatment with ASLE for 7 days significantly attenuated IR-mediated memory and sensorimotor function deficit in the animals. The extract also reduced the cerebral infarct size and rise in brain TBARS levels , and restored the GSH levels and SOD activity. Conclusions The results of the present study suggest that ASLE is safe and effective in improving functional outcomes. It demonstrates neuroprotective effect by enhancing the antioxidant defence against IR injury.
