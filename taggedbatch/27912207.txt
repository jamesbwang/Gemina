 Venous thromboembolism ( VTE) is highly prevalent in patients with cancer. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants ( NOACs) , directly targeting the enzymatic activity of thrombin or factor Xa , have been shown to be as effective as and safer than traditional anticoagulation for VTE prophylaxis in no-cancer patients. However , related studies that focused on the anticoagulation in cancer patients are lacked , and almost no net clinical benefit ( NCB) analyses that quantified both VTE events and bleeding events have been addressed in this fragile population. Therefore , we aim to investigate this issue using a systematic review and NCB analysis. A comprehensive search of Medline , Embase , and Cochrane Library were performed for randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) that reported the VTE events and major bleeding of NOACs and traditional anticoagulants in patients with or without cancer. Odds ratios ( ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) of VTE and bleeding events were calculated using a random-effects model. The primacy outcome of narrow NCB was calculated by pooling ORs of VTE and major bleeding , with a weighting of 1.0. Similarly , the broad NCB was calculated by pooling ORs of VTE and clinically relevant bleeding. Heterogeneity was assessed through
