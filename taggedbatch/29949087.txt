 Cerebral reperfusion and arterial recanalization are radiological features of the effectiveness of thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke ( AIS) patients. Here , an investigation of the prognostic role of early recanalization/reperfusion on clinical outcome was performed. In AIS patients ( n = 55) , baseline computerized tomography ( CT) was performed ≤ 8 h from symptom onset , whereas CT determination of reperfusion/recanalization was assessed at 24 h. Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used to correlate reperfusion/recanalization with radiological ( i.e. , hemorrhagic transformation , ischemic core , and penumbra volumes) and clinical outcomes ( assessed as National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS) reduction ≥ 8 points or a NIHSS ≤ 1 at 24 h and as modified Rankin Scale ( mRS) < 2 at 90 days). At 24 h , patients achieving radiological reperfusion were n = 24 , while the non-reperfused were n = 31. Among non-reperfused , n = 15 patients were recanalized. Radiological reperfusion vs. recanalization was also confirmed by early increased levels of circulating inflammatory biomarkers ( i.e. , serum osteopontin). In multivariate analysis , ischemic lesion<symptom> volume reduction was associated with both recanalization ( β = 0.265; p = 0.014) and reperfusion ( β = 0.461; p < 0.001) , but only reperfusion was independently associated with final infarct volume ( β =- 0.333; p = 0.007). Only radiological reperfusion at 24 h predicted good clinical response at day 1 ( adjusted OR 16.054 ( 1.423-181.158); p = 0.025) and 90-day good functional outcome ( adjusted OR 25.801 ( 1.483-448.840); p = 0.026). At ROC curve analysis the AUC of reperfusion was 0.777 ( p < 0.001) for the good clinical response at 24 h and 0.792 ( p < 0.001) for 90-day clinical outcome. Twenty-four-hour radiological reperfusion assessed by CT is associated with good clinical response on day 1 and good functional outcome on day 90 in patients with ischemic stroke.
