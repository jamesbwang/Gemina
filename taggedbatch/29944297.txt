 Guidelines for pain management in the medical and surgical departments of the Geneva University Hospitals ( GUH) have been systematically developed using a multidisciplinary approach. These guidelines are aimed towards improving healthcare quality. We point to the ways the pain network of the GUH has elected to deal with the ever-increasing progression of concepts regarding pain management. This is of importance at a time when the risks related to the patients ' transitions between the different departments , to the specificities of the clinical practices , and to the need for personalized care have never been so high.
