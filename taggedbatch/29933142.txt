 Use of chemical agricultural inputs such as nitrogen fertilisers ( N) in agricultural production can cause diffuse source pollution thereby degrading the health of coastal and marine ecosystems in coastal river catchments. Previous reviewed economic assessments of N management in agricultural production seldom consider broader environmental impacts and uncertain climatic and economic conditions. This paper presents an economic risk framework for assessing economic and environmental trade-offs of N management strategies taking into account variable climatic and economic conditions. The framework is underpinned by a modelling platform that integrates Agricultural Production System sIMulation modelling ( APSIM) , probability theory , Monte Carlo simulation , and financial risk analysis techniques. We applied the framework to a case study in Tully , a coastal catchment in north-eastern Australia with a well-documented N pollution problem. Our results show that switching from managing N to maximise private net returns to maximising social net returns could reduce expected private net returns by $ 99 ha
