 Sodium hydroxide is a corrosive , highly alkaline ( PKa = 14.8) household product. Ingestion of sodium hydroxide liquid is common , showing toxicity on the oesophagus and stomach. Nevertheless , cases of sodium hydroxide ingestions in pellet are rare and the management of them is unknown. We report the case of a 65-year-old man who accidentally swallowed a bleach tablet of 3.5 g. Six hours later , the patient developed an aphonia associated with dysponea stage IV , motivating a nasofibroscopy showing glottis and supraglottic necrosis<symptom> and oedema for which the patient received intravenous steroids , was intubated and then underwent a tracheotomy. After 2 weeks under tracheotomy , local evolution was favourable allowing a removal of the cannula and a return back home.
