 Endometriosis is the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus and is characterized by progesterone resistance and changes in global and progesterone target gene expression. However , the mechanism behind this and whether it is innate , acquired , or present in both the eutopic and ectopic tissue in not always clear. We find large-scale gene expression studies in eutopic tissue , indicative of progesterone resistance , are often contradictory , potentially due to the dynamic nature of this tissue , whereas suppressed progesterone receptor expression is supported in ectopic but not eutopic tissue. This suggests more studies are required in eutopic tissue particularly , and that potentially the suppressed progesterone receptor ( PR) expression is a consequence of the pathogenic process and exposure to the peritoneal environment.
