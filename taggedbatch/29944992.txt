 Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome<disease><symptom> ( RSTS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by growth retardation , skeletal anomalies and intellectual disability , caused by heterozygous mutation in either the CREBBP ( RSTS1) or EP300 ( RSTS2) genes. We generated an induced pluripotent stem cell line from an RSTS2 patient 's blood mononuclear cells by Sendai virus non integrative reprogramming method. The iPSC line ( IAIi001RSTS2-65-A) displayed iPSC morphology , expressed pluripotency markers , possessed trilineage differentiation potential and was stable by karyotyping. Mutation and western blot analyses demonstrated in IAIi001RSTS2-65-A the patient 's specific non sense mutation in exon 23 c. 3829A > T , p. ( Lys 1277 *) and showed reduced quantity of wild type p300 protein.
