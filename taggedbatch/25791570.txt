 Bone is an engineering marvel that achieves a unique combination of stiffness and toughness exceeding that of synthesized materials. In orthopedics , we are currently challenged for the child population that needs a less stiff but a tougher bone substitute than adults. Recent evidence suggests that the relationship between inter-molecular connections that involve the two main bone building blocks , TropoCollagen molecules ( TC) and carbonated Hydroxyapatite ( cAp) , and bone macroscopic mechanical properties , stiffness and toughness , are key to building bone substitute materials for children. The goal of our study is to establish how inter-molecular connections that occur during bone mineralization are related to macroscopic mechanical properties in child bones. Our aim is to link the biological alterations of the TC-cAp self assembly process happening during bone mineralization to the bone macroscopic mechanical properties ' alterations during aging. To do so , we have developed a multiscale mathematical model that includes collagen cross links ( TC ‚Åª TC interface) from experimental studies of bone samples to forecast bone macroscopic mechanical properties. Our results support that the Young 's modulus can not be a linear parameter if we want to solve our system. In relation to bone substitute material with innovative properties for children , our results propose values of several biological parameters , such as the number of crystals and their size , and collagen crosslink maturity for the desired bone mechanical competence. Our novel mathematical model combines mineralization and macroscopic mechanical behavior of bone and is a step forward in building mechanically customized biomimetic bone grafts that would fit children 's orthopedic needs.
