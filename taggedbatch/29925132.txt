 In order to study the significance of CD ( 276) and CD ( 133) in the development and progression of colorectal cancer ( CRC) , the expression of CD ( 276) and CD ( 133) was detected by immunohistochemistry in CRC and precancerous lesions<symptom>. The results showed that the intensity of CD ( 276) and CD ( 133) in CRC samples was higher than that in adenoma group and non-adenoma group. CD ( 276) and CD ( 133) single and double positive expression were significantly correlated with CRC lymph node metastasis , distant metastasis and survival. CD ( 276) and CD ( 133) are significantly correlated to the development and progression of CRC and associated with poor prognosis.
