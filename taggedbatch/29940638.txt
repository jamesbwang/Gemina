 To evaluate the predictability , efficacy and safety of Femtosecond-laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis ( LASIK) procedure for mixed astigmatism. We prospectively evaluated for 12 months 74 eyes ( 52 patients) with mixed astigmatism that underwent Femtosecond-LASIK treatment. The preoperative mean refractive sphere value was +1.879 ± 1.313 diopters ( D) and the mean refractive cylinder value was -4.169 ± 1.091 D. The anterior corneal flap was cut using the VisuMax ® femtosecond laser and then the stromal ablation was done using the MEL ® 80 excimer laser. Mean age was 30.22 ± 6.421 years with 61.53 % female patients. Postoperative spherical equivalent at 12 months was within ± 0.5 D of emmetropia in 75.8 % of eyes and within ± 1D in 97.3 % of eyes. Postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity was equivalent to or better than the preoperative corrected distance visual acuity in 91.9 % of eyes. Compared to the preoperative corrected distance visual acuity ( CDVA) , 8.1 % of eyes gained one line , 2.7 % gained two lines and 2.7 % gained three lines of visual acuity. Femtosecond-LASIK using the VisuMax ®- MEL ® 80 platform appears to have safe , effective and predictable results in mixed astigmatic eyes. The results are impressive for high refractive error treatment and for improvement of both uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity.
