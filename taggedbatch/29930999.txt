 TiO2 nanowire arrays are often utilized to prepare high performance polymer nanocomposites , however , the contribution to the energy density is limited due to their non-ferroelectric characteristics. A nanocomposite with an optimized nanowire array combining the ferroelectric properties of lead zirconate titanate ( PZT) with TiO2 , readily forming nanowires ( denoted as a TiO2-P nanowire array) , is prepared to enhance the permittivity. Poly ( vinylidene fluoride) ( PVDF) is used as the polymer matrix due to its high breakdown strength , e.g. 600-700 kV mm-1. As a result , the permittivity and breakdown electric field reach 53 at 1 kHz and 550 kV mm-1 , respectively. Therefore , the nanocomposites achieve a higher discharge energy density of 12.4 J cm-3 with excellent cycle stability , which is the highest among nanocomposites based on a nanowire array as a filler in a PVDF matrix. This work provides not only a feasible approach to obtain high performance dielectric nanocomposites , but also a wide range of potential applications in the energy storage and energy harvesting fields.
