 Polyamidoamine ( PAMAM) dendrimers were covalently immobilized on multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( MWNT) by two `` grafting to '' strategies. We demonstrate the existence of non-covalent interactions between the two components but outline the superiority of our two grafting approaches , namely xanthate and click chemistry. MWNT surfaces were functionalized with activated ester and propargylic moieties prior to their reaction with PAMAM or azido-PAMAM dendrimers , respectively. The grafting of PAMAM generations 0 to 3 was evaluated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) , thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA) , and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM). The versatility of our hybrids was demonstrated by post-functionalization sequences involving copper alkyne-azide cycloaddition ( CuAAC). We synthesized homogeneous supported iridium complexes at the extremities of the dendrimers. In addition , our materials were used as templates for the encapsulation of Pd nanoparticles ( NPs) , validating our nanocomposites for catalytic applications. The palladium-based catalyst was active for carbonylative coupling over five consecutive runs without loss of activity.
