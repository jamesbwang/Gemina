 To improve the durability and extraction efficiency of an ionic liquid coating , 1-dodecyl-3-vinylimidazolium bromide was polymerized and grafted onto basalt fibers for in-tube solid-phase microextraction. To develop an extraction tube , basalt fibers grafted with the poly ( ionic liquids) coating were filled into a polyether ether ketone tube with a 0.75 mm inner diameter. The extraction tube was connected to high-performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a sampling pump to build an online enrichment and analysis system. Using four common phthalates as model analytes , the extraction tube was investigated by the online analysis system. Good enrichment performance was exhibited by high enrichment factors ranging from 851 to 1858. Under the optimum conditions , an online analysis method was established , and good linearity ( 0.03-12 and 0.15-12 μg/L) and low limits of detection ( 0.01-0.05 μg/L) were achieved. This analysis method was applied to real samples including water in a disposable plastic box and the bottled water , some targets were detected but not quantified , and the relative recoveries spiked at 2 , 5 and 10 μg/L were in the range of 86.4-119.5 %.
