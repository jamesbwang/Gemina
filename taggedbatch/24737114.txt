 Brain-computer interfaces ( BCI) are used in stroke rehabilitation to translate brain signals into intended movements of the paralyzed limb. However , the efficacy and mechanisms of BCI-based therapies remain unclear. Here we show that BCI coupled to functional electrical stimulation ( FES) elicits significant , clinically relevant , and lasting motor recovery in chronic stroke survivors more effectively than sham FES. Such recovery is associated to quantitative signatures of functional neuroplasticity. BCI patients exhibit a significant functional recovery after the intervention , which remains 6-12 months after the end of therapy. Electroencephalography analysis pinpoints significant differences in favor of the BCI group , mainly consisting in an increase in functional connectivity between motor areas in the affected hemisphere. This increase is significantly correlated with functional improvement. Results illustrate how a BCI-FES therapy can drive significant functional recovery and purposeful plasticity thanks to contingent activation of body natural efferent and afferent pathways.
