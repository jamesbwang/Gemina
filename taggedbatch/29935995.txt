 Biological invasions have the potential to influence parasite dynamics by altering ecological interactions. Similarly , parasitism can influence invasion by aiding or limiting expansion. While many parasite-invasion relationships have been evaluated , many have not been described. Here , we present a conceptual framework of potential interactions , and introduce two new concepts. The first , disease facilitation , nested within the parasite spillback hypothesis , is when invasive species facilitate parasite transmission through habitat alteration or physical transfer. The second , suppressive spillover , is when the deleterious effects of parasitic infection limit the expansion of an introduced species ( and hence invasion success). Taken together , the proposed framework may aide in our understanding of ecological drivers of invasion and parasite ecology and can be used to improve mitigation strategies.
