 DNA and RNA nanotechnology has been used for the development of dynamic molecular devices. In particular , programmable enzyme-free nucleic acid circuits , such as catalytic hairpin assembly , have been demonstrated as useful tools for bioanalysis and to scale up system complexity to an extent beyond current cellular genetic circuits. However , the intracellular functions of most synthetic nucleic acid circuits have been hindered by challenges in the biological delivery and degradation. On the other hand , genetically encoded and transcribed RNA circuits emerge as alternative powerful tools for long-term embedded cellular analysis and regulation. Herein , we reported a genetically encoded RNA-based catalytic hairpin assembly circuit for sensitive RNA imaging inside living cells. The split version of Broccoli , a fluorogenic RNA aptamer , was used as the reporter. One target RNA can catalytically trigger the fluorescence from tens-to-hundreds of Broccoli. As a result , target RNAs can be sensitively detected. We have further engineered our circuit to allow easy programming to image various target RNA sequences. This design principle opens the arena for developing a large variety of genetically encoded RNA circuits for cellular applications.
