 Adult pancreatic acinar cells have the ability to re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate upon injury or tissue loss. Despite this mitotic ability , the extent of acinar proliferation is often limited and unable to completely regenerate the injured tissue or restore the initial volume of the organ , thus leading to pancreatic dysfunction. Identifying molecular determinants of enhanced proliferation is critical to overcome this issue. In this study , we discovered that Murphy Roths Large ( MRL/MpJ) mice can be exploited to identify molecular effectors promoting acinar proliferation upon injury , with the ultimate goal to develop therapeutic regimens to boost pancreatic regeneration. Our results show that , upon cerulein-induced acinar injury , cell proliferation was enhanced and cell cycle components up-regulated in the pancreas of MRL/MpJ mice compared to the control strain C57BL/6. Initial damage of acinar cells was exacerbated in these mice , manifested by increased serum levels of pancreatic enzymes , intra-pancreatic trypsinogen activation and acinar cell apoptosis. In addition , MRL/MpJ pancreata presented enhanced inflammation<symptom> , de-differentiation of acinar cells and acinar-to-ductal metaplasia. Manipulation of inflammatory levels and mitogenic stimulation with the thyroid hormone 5,3-L-tri-iodothyronine revealed that factors derived from initial acinar injury rather than inflammatory injury promote the replicative advantage in MRL/MpJ mice.
