 National prevalence estimates of Between November 2016 and January 2017 , we performed a national population-based cross-sectional probability sample survey among men and women aged 18-34 years in the Netherlands. Individuals were invited to complete a questionnaire about sexual health. At the end of the questionnaire , sexually active individuals could request a home-based sampling kit. Samples were tested for chlamydia<pathogen> and gonorrhoea<disease> using nucleic acid amplification test ( NAAT). Logistic regression analyses were performed for predictors of participation and chlamydia<pathogen> infection. Of the 17222 invited individuals , 4447 ( 26 %) participated. Of these , 3255 were eligible for prevalence survey participation and 550 ( 17 %) returned a sample. Participation in the prevalence survey was associated with age ( 20 +) and risk factors for STI. We did not detect any gonorrhoea<disease>. The overall weighted prevalence of chlamydia<pathogen> was 2.8 % ( 95 % CI 1.5 % to 5.2 %); 1.1 % ( 0.1 % to 7.2 %) in men and 5.6 % ( 3.3 % to 9.5 %) in women. Risk factors for chlamydia<pathogen> infections in women aged 18-24 years were low/medium education level , not having a relationship with the person you had most recent sex with and age at first sex older than 16. Chlamydia<pathogen> and gonorrhoea<disease> prevalence were low in the general Dutch population , as was the participation rate. Repeated prevalence surveys are needed to analyse trends in STI prevalences and to evaluate control policies.
