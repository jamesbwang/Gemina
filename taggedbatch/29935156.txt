 High-grade gliomas ( HGGs; grades III and IV) are the most common and aggressive adult primary brain tumors , and their invasive nature ranks them the fourth in the incidence of cancer death. In our previous study , we found that AG-1031 and AG-1503 showed inhibitory effects on several cancer cell lines. In this study , C6 glioma-bearing rats were treated with AG-1031 or AG-1503. Western blot results of autophagy-associated protein ( LC3 II/I , Beclin-1) and apoptosis-associated proteins ( caspase-3 , Bcl-2 , Bax) revealed that AG-1031 could activate apoptotic signal pathway via inhibiting autophagy process in cancer cells. HE staining indicated that the tumor volumes were significantly decreased in AG-1031 and AG-1503 treated rats compared to non-treated C6 glioma-bearing rats. Meanwhile , AG-1031 and AG-1503 significantly decreased the expression of VEGF , a marker of invasion ability of tumor , in tumor tissue. The novel object recognition test showed that cognitive functions in C6 glioma-bearing rats were considerably damaged , whereas AG-1031 and AG-1503 significantly impeded the cognitive impairment. AG-1031 and AG-1503 efficiently alleviated the glioma-induced impairments of long-term potentiation ( LTP) , which was damaged in C6 glioma-bearing rats. Furthermore , AG-1031 and AG-1503 augmented the expression of synaptophysin ( SYP) , which were decreased in glioma rats. In conclusion , our results suggest that AG-1031 and AG-1503 can inhibit the expansion of glioma , and improve the cognitive impairment caused by glioma in glioma-bearing rats.
