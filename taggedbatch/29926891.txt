 Hydroa vaccinforme-like lymphoproliferative disorder ( HVLPD) is a rare T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder driven by the Epstein-Barr<disease> Virus ( EBV). It was initially designated under the 2008 WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues as a distinct entity but has been recently reclassified as a lymphoproliferative disorder under the 2016 revision of the 2008 WHO classification of lymphoid malignancies. HVLPD mainly affects Asian , Central , and South American children. It is rarely seen in adults. Although HVLPD may initially be limited to cutaneous involvement and run an indolent course , some patients may develop a rapidly aggressive course. We report a case of an elderly Chinese man with cutaneous-limited disease and a favorable course. A review of adult cases of HVLPD published in the English literature , with comparison to our case , is also presented in this paper.
