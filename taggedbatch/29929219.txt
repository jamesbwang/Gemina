 This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of 19 biocides in the aquatic environments ( including runoffs) of a highly urbanized region , and then analyze the sources and ecological risks of target biocides in the river system. The investigated results showed that 19 target biocides were universally detected in surface water ( 17) , sediment ( 19) and rainfall runoff ( 18). The tributaries of the river system were seriously contaminated by the biocides compared to the main stream. The prominent biocides in the riverine environment were methylparaben , climbazole and N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide ( DEET) for surface water , climbazole , triclosan and triclocarban for sediment , and DEET and carbendazim for rainfall runoff. The biocides source analysis based on the mass contribution suggested that domestic wastewater was a dominant input source for most biocides in the riverine environment , while rainfall runoff was another crucial input source for some biocides , especially for DEET and carbendazim. The ecological risk assessment revealed that some high levels biocides ( e.g. clotrimazole , carbendazim , and triclosan) could pose potential ecological risks to aquatic organisms. Therefore , it is essential that some efficient measures should be taken to reduce the input of biocides to river system from different sources.
