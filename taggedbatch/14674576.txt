 Advances in technology over the past decade have allowed unique methodologies to emerge , enabling the engagement of hard-to-reach populations on sensitive topics in a way that was before thought not possible with traditional face-to-face modalities. This study aimed to use online focus group discussions ( FGDs) to explore breastfeeding mothers ' use of social media. Results indicate participants had a positive experience with online FGDs , and almost all preferred this method to traditional face-to-face focus groups. We discuss reflections of the online FGD experience , including best practices and recommendations for innovative ways to include time-constrained or hard-to-reach participants , for yielding rich qualitative data.
