 Dysregulated expression of tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases ( TIMPs) is associated with systolic dysfunction and worsening heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF). However , no study has assessed the relationship between TIMP polymorphisms and chronic HF. In this study , 300 HF outpatients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and 304 healthy blood donors were genotyped for the 372 T > C polymorphism ( Phe124Phe; rs4898) in the TIMP-1 gene and the -418 G > C polymorphism ( rs8179090) in the TIMP-2 gene to investigate whether these polymorphisms are associated with HF susceptibility and prognosis. The genotype and allele frequencies of the 372 T > C polymorphism in HF patients were not significantly different from those observed among healthy subjects , and the C allele of the -418 G > C polymorphism was very rare in our population ( frequency < 1 %). After a median follow-up duration of 5.5 years , 121 patients ( 40.3 %) died ( 67 of them from HF). Survival analysis did not show statistically significant differences in all-cause death and HF-related death between patients with and without the T allele ( P > 0.05 for all comparisons). Thus , our findings do not support the hypothesis that the 372 T > C ( Phe124Phe) polymorphism in the TIMP-1 gene and the -418 G > C polymorphism in the TIMP-2 gene are associated with HF susceptibility and prognosis in Southern Brazilians.
