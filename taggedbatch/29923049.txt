 Sonicated activated carbon ( SAC) was developed and used to remove ibuprofen and ketoprofen from aqueous media by adsorption. A standard activated carbon sample ( AC) was used as comparison. Both adsorbents were characterized by X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR) , N
