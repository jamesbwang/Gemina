 Our previous study suggests a well-defined pharmacological activity of 20 ( R) -25-methoxyl-dammarane-3β ,12 β,20-triol ( AD-1) and its metabolite 20 ( R)- dammarane-3β ,12 β,20,25-tetrol ( AD-2). The current study aims to investigate the gender-related differences in pharmacokinetics , tissue distribution , and excretion of AD-1 and its metabolite in both male and female rats. A sensitive and rapid ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric ( UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed for the simultaneous determination of AD-1 and AD-2 levels in plasma , various tissues , bile , urine , and feces. The results showed that AD-1 and its metabolite were rapidly distributed and eliminated from rat plasma; linear dynamics ( r ≥ 0.8042) was observed in the dose range of 10-40 mg/kg. Compared with male rats , AD-1 and AD-2 were eliminated slowly from the plasma of female rats , and significant gender-related differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics as well as tissue distribution , however , long-term accumulation was not observed. Gender also significantly influenced excretion via urine and feces , but this effect was not observed in the bile excretion study. In rats , AD-1 and its metabolite were highly distributed in female genital organs , which implied that AD-1 and AD-2 might have a great potential for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Therefore , this study first investigated the in vitro activity of AD-1 and AD-2 for ovarian cancer. The results indicated that AD-1 , AD-2 , and Mitomycin C ( Mito C) obviously inhibited the growths of ovarian cancer cells ( HO-8910 and OVCAR ( R) -3). At 40 , 80 μM , AD-1 , AD-2 reduced growth of two ovarian Cancer cells by 80 % , were more effective than Mito C , and AD-1 showed stronger anti-ovarian cancer cell activity than AD-2. The results provide a theoretical basis for the future studies of AD-1 and AD-2 in ovarian cancer.
