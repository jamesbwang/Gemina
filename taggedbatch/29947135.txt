 The synergistic effect of two acidic amino acids , aspartic and glutamic acid , on the electrophoretic enantioseparation of four basic drugs was evaluated in the BGE containing a CD and at different pHs. Chlorpheniramine , hydroxyzine , propranolol and tramadol were used as the basic model drugs. However , no enantioseparations were achieved with a BGE containing sole amino acid , but the combined use of an acidic amino acid and a CD showed improved enantioseparations ( synergistic effect) compared with the single CD system. The results demonstrated that at optimized pH , the electrostatic interactions of the anionic amino acids with the positively charged basic drugs could result in a decrease of the analyte migration velocity and it consequently improved the enantioseparation. The effective parameters such as the amino acid and chiral selector type and concentration , buffer pH , applied voltage , and capillary temperature were optimized. Favorable enantiomeric resolution and migration times of the model drugs were achieved with a 100 mM phosphate buffer solution ( pH 3.0) containing 5.0 mM HP-α-CD/HP-β-CD and 20 mM aspartic acid with an 18 kV applied voltage at 25 °C.
