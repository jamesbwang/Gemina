 Origins of stereoselectivity in ROP of racemic chiral cyclic esters promoted by achiral yttrium complexes , resulting in the formation of highly heterotactic polylactide , and highly syndiotactic or , more uniquely , highly isotactic poly ( 3-hydroxybutyrate) s , are discussed. A close interplay between the nature of the cyclic ester , most particularly of the exocyclic functional chain installed on the chiral center of Î²-lactones , and the ortho-substituents installed on the phenolate rings of the ligand , results in various determining secondary interactions of steric and also electronic nature.
