 In this study , novel composite titanium-based metal-organic framework ( MOF) beads were synthesized from titanium based metal organic framework MIL-125 and chitosan ( CS) and used to remove Pb ( II) from wastewater. The MIL-125-CS beads were prepared by combining the titanium-based MIL-125 MOF and chitosan using a template-free solvothermal approach under ambient conditions. The surface and elemental properties of these beads were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy , Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies , as well as thermal gravimetric analysis. Moreover , a series of experiments designed to determine the influences of factors such as initial Pb ( II) concentration , pH , reaction time and adsorption temperature was conducted. Notably , it was found that the adsorption of Pb ( II) onto the MIL-125-CS beads reached equilibrium in 180 min to a level of 407.50 mg/g at ambient temperature. In addition , kinetic and equilibrium experiments provided data that were fit to the Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second-order kinetics. Furthermore , reusability tests showed that MIL-125-CS retained 85 % of its Pb ( II)- removal capacity after five reuse cycles. All in all , we believe that the developed MIL-125-CS beads are a promising adsorbent material for the remediation of environmental water polluted by heavy metal ions.
