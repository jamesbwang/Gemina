 Due to the importance of hypochlorous acid ( HClO) in biological and industrial , development of fluorescent probes for HClO has been an active research area. Here , a new red-emitting ratiometric fluorescent probe ( P) was synthesized and well defined characterization via NMR , HR-MS , and fluorescence spectrum , which serves as a selective and sensitive probe for ClO<pathogen>
