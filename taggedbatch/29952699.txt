 Foam Rolling ( FR) increases joint range of motion ( RoM) , but the optimal training parameters are unknown. To investigate the effect of FR velocity on RoM and tissue stiffness. Randomized , controlled crossover trial. University. Seventeen healthy , physically active adults ( 25 Â± 2 years , 10 females). 1) 4x45s high-velocity FR of the anterior thigh ( FAST-FR) , 2) 4x45s slow-velocity FR of the anterior thigh ( SLOW-FR) , 3) inactive control ( CON) Outcome measures: Maximal knee flexion RoM ( ultrasonic movement analysis) and anterior thigh tissue stiffness ( semi-electronic tissue compliance meter) , assessed assessed pre , immediately post ( T0) , as well as five ( T5) , and ten ( T10) minutes post-intervention. Statistical analysis included Friedman tests with adjusted post-hoc comparisons ( Wilcoxon tests). According to omnibus testing , RoM remained unchanged in all three conditions and at all time points ( p > .05) , while differences were found for tissue stiffness ( p < .05): Post-hoc tests revealed significant decreases following FAST-FR ( T5: -17 % , T10: -24 %; p < .05) and SLOW-FR ( T10: -15 %; p < .05). The observed stiffness changes were significant in comparison to CON ( p < .01) , but no difference was found between the two FR conditions ( p > .05). FR of the anterior thigh decreases myofascial stiffness regardless of velocity. The lack of effects on RoM contrasts findings of recent literature and warrants further investigation.
