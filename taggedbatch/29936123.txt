 The progression of castration resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC) is driven by the intratumoral conversion of adrenal androgen precursors to potent androgens. The expression of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 ( AKR1C3) , which catalyses the reduction of weak androgens to more potent androgens , is significantly increased in CRPC tumours. The oxidation of androgens to their inactive form is catalysed by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 ( 17βHSD2) , but little attention is given to the expression levels of this enzyme. In this study , we show that the 11-oxygenated androgen precursors of adrenal origin are the preferred substrate for AKR1C3. In particular we show that the enzymatic efficiency of AKR1C3 is 8- and 24-fold greater for 11-ketoandrostenedione than for the classic substrates androstenedione and 5α-androstanedione , respectively. Using three independent experimental systems and a computational model we subsequently show that increased ratios of AKR1C3: 17βHSD2 significantly favours the flux through the 11-oxygenated androgen pathway as compared to the classical or 5α-androstanedione pathways. Our findings reveal that the flux through the classical and 5α-androstanedione pathways are limited by the low catalytic efficiently of AKR1C3 towards classical androgens combined with the high catalytic efficiency of 17βHSD2 , and that the expression of the oxidative enzyme therefore plays a vital role in determining the steady state concentration of active androgens. Using microarray data from prostate tissue we confirm that the AKR1C3: 17βHSD2 ratio is significantly increased in patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy as compared to benign tissue , and further increased in patients with CRPC. Taken together this study therefore demonstrates that the ratio of AKR1C3: 17βHSD2 is more important than AKR1C3 expression alone in determining intratumoral androgen levels and that 11-oxygenated androgens may play a bigger role in CRPC than previously anticipated.
