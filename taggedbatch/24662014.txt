 This study investigated the interactions between tree-herb layer diversity and some physico-chemical and eco-physiological characteristics of soil in natural oriental beech stand in western Guilan , Iran. The data were collected from nine research sites ( 50 m × 50 m) which were described as a gradient from pure oriental beech ( Fagus orientalis<pathogen> Lipsky) stands to mixed stands with up to nine deciduous tree species ( n = 27) in Hyrcanian forest<disease>. Herbaceous plants were sampled within ten 1 m × 1 m sub-plots in two plots of 400 m
