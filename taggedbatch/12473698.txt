 In pediatric spine surgery nonunion is a challenging issue. Instability may cause neurological impairment and lead to numerous surgeries in order to achieve fusion. The use of rhBMP-2 for pediatric spinal fusion has not been widely reported. In this study , a series of 13 children ( 14 procedures) that underwent spinal rhBMP-2 application were analyzed in order to measure clinical and radiographic outcome. Therefore , patient data , diagnosis , construct of instrumentation , type of bone graft , quantity of BMP used , and fusion outcome were reviewed. The study cohort included four female and nine male patients with a mean age of 11.2 years ( range 2.6-19.2 years) at the time of rhBMP-2 application. Rh-BMP-2 was used in both primary ( n = 6) and revision surgery ( n = 8) in patients with a high risk for the development of nonunion. The mean follow-up was 51 months ( range 12-108 months). Fusion occurred in 11 patients. Complications that may be due to application of rhBMP-2 were seen after four operations. Three patients had an increased body temperature and in one case prolonged wound<disease><symptom> secretion was evident , treated by local wound<disease><symptom> care or observation. In one of these patients an extensive postoperative hematoma occurred , necessitating surgical treatment. In conclusion , we could detect high fusion rates following the use of rhBMP-2 in pediatric spine surgery without an increased complication rate attributable to its application. Therefore we consider recombinant human BMP-2 to be an option in selected pediatric spinal procedures , especially in cases with compromised bone healing due to congenital , systemic , or local conditions.
