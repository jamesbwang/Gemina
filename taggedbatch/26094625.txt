 It has previously been reported that cardamonin is able to regulate glycometabolism and vasodilation whilst also exhibiting anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties. The antitumor effect of cardamonin is multifaceted , and so it is necessary to investigate the antitumor mechanisms of cardamonin at the molecular level. Cardamonin alters chemotherapy-resistant colon cancer cell growth; however , the underlying mechanism is unknown. The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of cardamonin on chemotherapy-resistant colon cancer cells and the possible mechanisms of action. Cardamonin significantly suppressed the growth of chemotherapy-resistant colon cancer cells , induced apoptosis and promoted caspase-3/ 9 activity and Bax protein expression in 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU)- resistant HCT-116 cells. Cardamonin significantly suppressed c-MYC , octamer-binding transcription factor 4 , cyclin E , testes-specific protease 50 and nuclear factor-κB protein expression in 5-FU-resistant HCT-116 cells. The findings of the present study demonstrate that cardamonin suppresses chemotherapy-colon cancer cell via the NF-κB pathway
