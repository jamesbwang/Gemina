 Paraquat can cause severe injury to vascular endothelial cells and lead to coagulation dysfunction when it is taken into the blood by oral ingestion. In this study , we aim to find a routine coagulation index to serve as an indicator of outcome in patients with acute paraquat poisoning<disease>. Between January 2012 and December 2016 , 209 patients who attempted suicide by oral ingestion of paraquat were admitted to the emergency room. Routine coagulation indices , including plasma prothrombin time ( PT) , activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT) , fibrinogen ( Fbg) , thrombin time ( TT) , and D-dimer were measured to analyze the trend of changes and their relationship with prognosis. The results showed that the PT and APTT values in the ≥ 30 mL group were significantly greater than those in the < 30 mL group ( both P < .01). Within 1 week of admission , PT and APTT values gradually decreased , while Fbg levels gradually increased. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that sex , ingestion volume , and PT were independent predictors of mortality within 40 days. The cumulative survival rates differed significantly ( P = .001) between patients with PT < 12 seconds and PT ≥ 12 seconds. Coagulation status in patients with PQ poisoning<disease> was closely related to prognosis. Routine monitoring of coagulation function , particularly PT in plasma , is helpful for analysis of the condition and prognosis of patients with PQ poisoning<disease>.
