 Background The approach to the clinical management of Graves ' disease ( GD) is debatable. This study aimed to identify predictors of remission in pediatric GD. Methods A longitudinal study of 36 children and adolescents with GD followed from 1997 to 2017 at a single tertiary hospital was performed. Clinical and biochemical parameters , including comorbidities , treatment with anti-thyroid drugs ( ATD) or definitive therapy ( radioiodine ( RIT) and thyroidectomy) , and remission as the main outcome were collected. We performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify likely predictors of remission. Results Among patients , most were female , in late puberty , with exuberant symptoms at onset. Eleven also suffered from Down syndrome<disease><symptom> ( DS). Thirty-four patients ( 94 %) started on methimazole from disease onset , and 25 ( 69 %) received it as the only therapy , with a mean duration of 2.7 ± 1.8 years. Six changed to RIT and three underwent thyroidectomy; no DS patient received definitive therapy. Remission was higher in DS patients ( 45 % vs. 25 % , p = 0.24) , but afterwards ( 3.9 ± 2.5 vs. 2.3 ± 1.4 years , p < 0.05); there was no significance in relapsing ( 20 % vs. 15 %). Females were less likely to reach remission ( p < 0.05); serum free thyroxine at onset was higher ( p < 0.05) in patients who required definitive therapy. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin ( TSI) values normalized in exclusively ATD therapy , especially from 2 years on ( p < 0.05). Conclusions Males were more likely to achieve remission. TSI values may normalize in GD , notably from the second year of treatment. DS children may benefit with conservative management in GD.
