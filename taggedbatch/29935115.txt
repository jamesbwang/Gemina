 A thyroid storm ( TS) is a rare , but life-threatening condition in hyperthyroid patients. Mortality in adult TS patients may be as high as 10 %. Typically , a trigger precipitates the storm in hyperthyroid patients. We report the case of an adolescent girl with untreated hyperthyroidism who developed fulminant TS after a significant choking episode. Initially , she was found to have neck swelling and tachycardia<symptom> leading providers to suspect infection. She deteriorated after a CAT Scan ( CT) was performed with iodine contrast , potentially worsening storm symptoms. Here , we describe the case , the treatment strategy and propose a treatment modification for pediatric patients. While many children are found to have minor abnormalities in thyroid studies , this case highlights the critical importance of prompt medical attention for any child with significantly elevated free thyroxine ( FT4) levels as morbidity can occur when left untreated.
