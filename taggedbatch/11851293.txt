 The recent increase of parasitic<disease> diseases<disease> associated with wildlife tourism can be traced to human contact with wildlife and intense modification of wildlife habitat. The continental estimates of parasitic<disease> diseases<disease> among visited wildlife-tourists and mammalian wildlife present in conservation areas are lacking; therefore , a general review was necessary to provide insights into Africa 's parasitic<disease> disease<disease> burden and transmission between humans and wildlife. A two-step analysis was conducted with searches in Ovid MEDLINE , EMBASE , PubMed , Web of Science and Global Health. All diseases reported without prevalence were grouped and analysed as categorical data while meta-analysis of prevalence rates of parasitic<disease> diseases<disease> in wildlife from national parks and reserves in Africa was conducted. Only 4.7 % of the tourist centres reported routine wildlife diagnosis for parasitic<disease> diseases<disease>. Disease intensity shows that cryptosporidiosis and seven other parasitic<disease> diseases<disease> were observed in both human and wildlife; however , no significant difference in intensity between human and wildlife hosts was observed. Schistosomiasis intensity reports showed a significant increase ( P < 0.05) while entamoebiasis showed a significant decrease ( P < 0.05) in humans as compared to wildlife. Visiting tourists were more infected with malaria<disease> , while wildlife was more infected with parasitic gastroenteritis<disease><symptom> ( PGE). The meta-analysis of wildlife revealed the highest prevalence of PGE with mixed parasites and lowest prevalence of Giardia spp. at 99.9 and 5.7 % , respectively. The zoonotic and socioeconomic impact of some of these parasites could pose a severe public threat to tourism. Pre- and post-travel clinical examinations are important for tourists while routine examination , treatment and rational surveillance are important for these animals to improve wildlife tourism.
