 Although the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO) guidelines recommend a dialysate calcium concentration between 2.5 and 3.0 mEq/L , its optimal concentration remains unclear. A total of 53 hemodialysis patients with intact parathyroid hormone ( PTH) levels < 150 pg/mL were enrolled in this prospective observational study. A dialysate calcium concentration was converted from 3.0 to 2.75 mEq/L and bone metabolic markers including bone alkaline phosphatase ( BAP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b ( TRACP-5b) were examined. After 3 months , serum corrected calcium levels decreased ( P < 0.001) , while serum intact PTH , BAP and TRACP-5b levels increased ( P < 0.05 , P < 0.05 and P < 0.001 , respectively). Multiple regression analyses showed that the amount of change in BAP was significantly associated with dialysis vintage ( P < 0.01). In conclusion , the lowering of dialysate calcium concentration stimulated parathyroid gland and bone remodeling in hemodialysis patients with suppressed PTH , particularly with longer dialysis vintage.
