 There is scarce evidence about the prognosis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and in patients suffering non-surgical trauma. We used the RIETE database ( Registro Informatizado de pacientes con Enfermedad Trombo Emb√≥lica) to compare the prognosis of venous thromboembolism and the use of thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing different orthopedic procedures and in trauma patients not requiring surgery. From March 2001 to March 2015 , a total of 61,789 patients were enrolled in RIETE database. Of these , 943 ( 1.52 %) developed venous thromboembolism after elective arthroplasty , 445 ( 0.72 %) after hip fracture , 1,045 ( 1.69 %) after non-major orthopedic surgery and 2,136 ( 3.46 %) after non-surgical trauma. Overall , 2,283 patients ( 50 %) initially presented with pulmonary embolism. Within the first 90 days of therapy , 30 patients ( 0.66 %; 95 % CI 0.45-0.93) died from pulmonary embolism. The rate of fatal pulmonary embolism was significantly higher after hip fracture surgery ( n = 9 ( 2.02 %)) than after elective arthroplasty ( n = 5 ( 0.53 %)) , non-major orthopedic surgery ( n = 5 ( 0.48 %)) or non surgical trauma ( n = 11 ( 0.48 %)). Thromboprophylaxis was more commonly used for hip fracture ( 93 %) or elective arthroplasty ( 94 %) than for non-major orthopedic surgery ( 71 %) or non-surgical trauma ( 32 %). Major bleeding was significantly higher after hip fracture surgery ( 4 %) than that observed after elective arthroplasty ( 1.6 %) , non-major orthopedic surgery ( 1.5 %) or non-surgical trauma ( 1.4 %). Thromboprophylaxis was less frequently used in lower risk procedures despite the absolute number of fatal pulmonary embolism after non-major orthopedic surgery or non-surgical trauma , exceeded that observed after high risk procedures.
