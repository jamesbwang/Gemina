 The plant metal tolerance protein family ( MTP) includes 12 members that have been classified into three phylogenetically different subgroups- Zn-cation diffusion facilitator ( CDF) , Fe/Zn-CDF and Mn-CDF- based on their putative metal specificity. To date , only members belonging to the Zn-CDF or Mn-CDF group have been characterized functionally. The plant Fe/Zn-CDF subgroup includes two proteins , MTP6 and MTP7 , but their function and metal specificity have not been confirmed. In this study we showed that cucumber CsMTP7 is a highly specific mitochondrial Fe importer that is able to confer yeast tolerance to Fe excess through increased accumulation of Fe in the mitochondria. We also demonstrated that CsMTP7 contributes to the increased accumulation of Fe in the mitochondria of Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts. The transcripts and mitochondrial levels of CsMTP7 and ferritin- the iron-storing protein- are significantly increased in cucumber roots in response to Fe excess. This finding suggests that CsMTP7 and ferritin work in concert to accumulate Fe in plant mitochondria. As genes that encode orthologous proteins have been identified in phylogenetically distant organisms , including Archaea , cyanobacteria , humans and plants , but not in yeast , we concluded that the MTP7-mediated mitochondrial Fe accumulation may be conserved in the species , and express mitochondrial ferritin for mitochondrial Fe storage.
