 The epigenetic mark 5-hydroxymethylcytosine ( 5-hmC) is a distinct product of active DNA demethylation that is linked to gene regulation , development , and disease. In particular , 5-hmC levels dramatically decline in many cancers , potentially serving as an epigenetic biomarker. The noise associated with next-generation 5-hmC sequencing hinders reliable analysis of low 5-hmC containing tissues such as blood and malignant tumors. Additionally , genome-wide 5-hmC profiles generated by short-read sequencing are limited in providing long-range epigenetic information relevant to highly variable genomic regions , such as the 3.7 Mbp disease-related Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA) region. We present a long-read , highly sensitive single-molecule mapping technology that generates hybrid genetic/epigenetic profiles of native chromosomal DNA. The genome-wide distribution of 5-hmC in human peripheral blood cells correlates well with 5-hmC DNA immunoprecipitation ( hMeDIP) sequencing. However , the long single-molecule read-length of 100 kbp to 1 Mbp produces 5-hmC profiles across variable genomic regions that failed to show up in the sequencing data. In addition , optical 5-hmC mapping shows a strong correlation between the 5-hmC density in gene bodies and the corresponding level of gene expression. The single-molecule concept provides information on the distribution and coexistence of 5-hmC signals at multiple genomic loci on the same genomic DNA molecule , revealing long-range correlations and cell-to-cell epigenetic variation.
