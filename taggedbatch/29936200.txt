 d-β-hydroxybutyrate and melatonin ( BHB/MLT) infusion improves survival in hemorrhagic shock<symptom> models. The original BHB/MLT formulation contains dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO) to increase melatonin solubility. We formulated BHB/MLT solutions wherein DMSO was replaced either with 10 % polyvinylpyrrolidone ( BHB/MLT/PVP) or with 5 % hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin/2 .5 % PVP/2 .5 % polyethylene glycol 400 ( BHB/MLT/CD). Safety and efficacy of the new and the original BHB/MLT solution were tested in a lethal rat hemorrhagic shock<symptom> model , with seven groups: 1) sham , 2) shock<symptom> , untreated , 3) shock<symptom> , lactated Ringer 's solution ( LR) , 4) shock<symptom> , 4 M BHB/MLT/DMSO , 5) shock<symptom> , 2 M BHB/MLT/DMSO , 6) shock<symptom> , BHB/MLT/PVP and 7) shock<symptom> , BHB/MLT/CD. BHB/MLT/DMSO was given at full strength and 1:1 dilution to match the concentration of the novel formulations. Rats were anesthetized , instrumented , and 40 % of the total blood volume was withdrawn in three steps , followed by four-hour long shock<symptom>. Treatment boluses were infused half-way throughout hemorrhage<symptom>. Survival was highest in BHB/MLT/CD-treated rats ( 8/10) , followed by the BHB/MLT/PVP ( 6/10) , 4 M BHB/MLT/DMSO ( 5/10) or 2 M BHB/MLT/DMSO ( 5/10) , LR ( 3/10) and the untreated group ( 0/11). Survival did not differ significantly between BHB/MLT groups ( p > 0.05) , but was significantly higher in BHB/MLT/CD than in LR-treated animals ( p = 0.018). BHB/MLT/PVP and BHB/MLT/CD constitute promising candidates for clinical hemorrhagic shock<symptom> treatment.
