 The role of Hertwig 's epithelial root sheath ( HERS) cells in periodontal formation has been controversial. This study aimed to further clarify whether HERS cells participate in formation of the periodontium , and the necessity of HERS cells in differentiation of dental follicle cells ( DFCs) for periodontal regeneration. HERS cells and DFCs were isolated and identified from post-natal 7-day Sprauge-Dawley rats. In vitro , direct co-culture of HERS cells and DFCs as well as the individual culture of HERS and DFCs were performed and followed by alizarin red staining and the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. For in vivo evaluation , the inactivated dentin matrix ( iTDM) was fabricated. HERS cells and DFCs were seeded in combination or alone on iTDM and then transplanted into the rat omentum. Scanning electron microscope and further histological analysis were carried out. In vitro , mineral-like nodules<symptom> were found in the culture of HERS cells alone or HERS + DFCs either by alizarin red staining or scanning electronic microscope. The mineralization and fiber-forming relevant mRNA expressions , such as bone sialoprotein , osteopontin , collagen I and collagen III in HERS + DFCs were significantly higher than that of the HERS or DFCs alone group. After transplantation in vivo , cementum and periodontal ligament-like tissues were formed in groups of HERS + DFCs and HERS alone , while no evident hard tissues and attached fibers were found in DFCs alone. Hertwig 's epithelial root sheath cells directly participate in the formation of the periodontium , and they are essential for the differentiation of dental follicle cells to form periodontal structures. The combination use of Hertwig 's epithelial root sheath cells and dental follicle cells is a promising approach for periodontal regeneration.
