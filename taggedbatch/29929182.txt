 Between 2001 and 2012 , the health authority of Hamburg-Eimsbüttel carried out a health promotion programme for children and their parents in a disadvantaged neighbourhood called Lenzsiedlung. The programme consisted of different action fields aiming at sustainable establishment of community capacities. The research goal was the long-term assessment of community capacities with a newly developed instrument ` KEQ ' ( KEQ = Kapazitätsentwicklung im Quartier/capacity building in small areas/neighbourhoods). Practitioners and researchers wanted to know whether community capacities could be increased , which changes occurred during the programme and whether processes of capacity building could be maintained. Research results were also used for the continuous adjustment of the programme to community needs. Three surveys on community capacities were conducted ( t1: June 2006 ( including a retrospective measurement of t0: 2001); t2: June 2008; and t3: November 2011) , each directed to 40-60 stakeholders of the Lenzsiedlung. The instrument consists of five domains ( participation , local leadership , available resources , networking and cooperation and health care) with a total of 51 items. For the community capacities , we found a positive trend from 2001 to 2006 supported by data from a documentary analysis over the same period of time. Then , 2006-2011 was a phase of consolidation with only slight improvements ( e.g. in the particularly important domain ` health care '). The results show the feasibility of a community health promotion programme and its maintenance over a period of 10 years. However , Lenzgesund was not the sole programme in the neighbourhood during the period of observation , so that not all improvements in capacities are directly assignable to the interventions. The instrument mainly reflects the possibly one-sided perspective of the interviewed experts from the community.
