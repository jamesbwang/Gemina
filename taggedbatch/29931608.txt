 Photosynthetic microalgae are of burgeoning interest in the generation of commercial bioproducts. Microalgae accumulate high lipid content under adverse conditions , which in turn compromise their growth and hinder their commercial potential. Hence , it is necessary to engineer microalgae to mitigate elevated lipid accumulation and biomass. In this study , we identified acetyl-CoA carboxylase ( ACCase) in oleaginous microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum ( PtACC2) and expressed constitutively in the chloroplast to demonstrate the potential of chloroplast engineering. Molecular characterization of transplastomic microalgae revealed that PtACC2 was integrated , transcribed and expressed successfully , and localized in the chloroplast. Enzymatic activity of ACCase was elevated by 3.3-fold , and the relative neutral lipid content increased substantially by 1.77-fold , and lipid content reached up to 40.8 % of dry<symptom> weight. Accordingly , the number and size of oil bodies markedly increased. Fatty acid profiling showed that the content of monounsaturated fatty acids increased , while polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased. This method provides a valuable genetic engineering toolbox for microalgal bioreactors with industrial significance.
