 The reaction of a pentadentate NHC ligand precursor with Ni ( OAc) 2 Â· 4H2O or Pd ( OAc) 2 in the presence of a base yields four-coordinate square-planar Ni ( ii) and Pd ( ii) complexes with an unusual ligand generated in situ. A series of experimental studies point to a ring-opening and ring-closing process via novel C-N bond cleavage and formation.
