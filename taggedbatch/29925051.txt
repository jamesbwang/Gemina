 Low serum albumin ( SA) is a prognostic factor for poor outcome after cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to estimate the association between pre-operative SA , early post-operative SA and postoperative myocardial injury. This single center cohort study included adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery during 4 consecutive years. Postoperative myocardial damage was defined by calculating the area under the curve ( AUC) of troponin ( Tn) values during the first 72 h after surgery and its association with SA analyzed using linear regression and with multivariable linear regression to account for patient related and procedural confounders. The association between SA and the secondary outcomes ( peri-operative myocardial infarction ( PMI) , requiring ventilation > 24 h , rhythm disturbances , 30-day mortality) was studied using ( multivariable) log binomial regression analysis. In total 2757 patients were included. The mean pre-operative SA was 29 ± 13 g/l and the mean post-operative SA was 26 ± 6 g/l. Post-operative SA levels ( on average 26 min after surgery) were inversely associated with postoperative myocardial damage in both univariable analysis ( regression coefficient- 0.019 , 95 % CI -0.022/ -0.015 , p < 0.005) and after adjustment for patient related and surgical confounders ( regression coefficient- 0.014 ( 95 % CI -0.020/ -0.008) , p < 0.0005). Post-operative albumin levels were significantly correlated with the amount of postoperative myocardial damage in patients undergoing cardiac surgery independent of typical confounders.
