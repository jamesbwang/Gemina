 Novel fast-acting antidepressant strategies , such as ketamine and deep brain stimulation , enhance glutamatergic neurotransmission in medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC) regions via AMPA receptor ( AMPA-R) activation. We recently reported that the regionally-selective blockade of the glial glutamate transporter-1 ( GLT-1) by dihydrokainic acid ( DHK) microinfusion in rat infralimbic cortex ( IL) , the most ventral part of the mPFC , evoked immediate ( 10 min) antidepressant-like responses , which involved AMPA-R activation and were associated to increased serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5-HT) release. Given the reciprocal connectivity between the mPFC and the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus ( DR) , here we examined the serotoninergic mechanisms involved in the reported antidepressant-like responses of DHK microinfusion. First , we show that antidepressant-like responses evoked by IL application of DHK and citalopram are mediated by local 5-HT
