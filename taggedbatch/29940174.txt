 PolyPurine Reverse Hoogsteen ( PPRH) hairpins constitute a relatively new pharmacological agent for gene silencing that has been applied for a growing number of gene targets. Previously we reported that specific PPRHs against the antiapoptotic gene survivin were able to decrease viability of PC3 prostate cancer cells by increasing apoptosis , while not acting on HUVEC non-tumoral cells. These PPRHs were efficient both in vitro and in vivo. In the present work , we performed a functional pharmacogenomics study on the effects of specific and unspecific hairpins against survivin. Incubation of PC3 cells with the specific HpsPr-C-WT led to 244 differentially expressed genes when applying the p < 0.05 , FC > 2 , Benjamini-Hochberg filtering. Importantly , the unspecific or control Hp-WC did not originate differentially expressed genes using the same settings. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( GSEA) revealed that the differentially expressed genes clustered very significantly within the gene sets of Regulation of cell proliferation , Cellular response to stress , Apoptosis and Prostate cancer. Network analyses using STRING identified important interacting gene-nodes within the response of PC3 cells to treatment with the PPRH against survivin , mainly POLR2G , PAK1IP1 , SMC3 , SF3A1 , PPARGC1A , NCOA6 , UGT2B7 , ALG5 , VAMP7 and HIST1H2BE , the former six present in the Gene Sets detected in the GSEA. Additionally , HepG2 and 786-O cell lines were used to carry out in vitro experiments of hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity , respectively. The unspecific hairpin did not cause toxicity in cell survival assays ( MTT) and produced minor changes in gene expression for selected genes in RT-qPCR arrays specifically developed for hepatic and renal toxicity screening.
