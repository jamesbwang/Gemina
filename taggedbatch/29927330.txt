 The objective of this article is to review the normal anatomy and posttraumatic findings of the Chopart joint complex. Key imaging features of the normal ligaments and patterns of ligamentous and osseous injuries are discussed. Traumatic midtarsal injuries , particularly midtarsal sprain , are often overlooked clinically and on imaging but are relatively common and typically are associated with inversion ankle injuries. Radiologists should be familiar with Chopart joint anatomy and the imaging features of midtarsal injuries because early diagnosis may help optimize clinical management.
