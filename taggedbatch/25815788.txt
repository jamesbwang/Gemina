 To evaluate the correlation between the hepatic expression pattern of hsa-miR-125a-5p and HBV-DNA and the progression of fibrosis<disease> in patients with overt or occult HBV infection. We enrolled all the HBsAg-positive treatment naive patients ( overt HBV group) and all the HBsAg-negative patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and with a positive HBV-DNA in their hepatic tissue ( occult HBV group) , who underwent a diagnostic liver biopsy between April 2007 and April 2015. Tissue concentrations of HBV-DNA and hsa-miR-125a-5p were then analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. Necroinflammatory activity and fibrosis<disease> were evaluated according to the Ishak score. During the study period , we enrolled 64 patients with overt and 10 patients with occult HBV infection. In the overt HBV group , 35 of 64 ( 54.7 %) showed a mild fibrosis<disease> ( staging 0-2) , 17 ( 26.6 %) a moderate fibrosis<disease> ( staging 3-4) , while the remaining 12 ( 18.7 %) had a cirrhosis. All patients in the occult HBV group were cirrhotic. Patients with more advanced fibrosis<disease> stage showed a higher mean age when compared with those with mild ( This study suggests a correlation between the tissue expression of hsa-miR-125a-5p and the progression of liver damage in a group of patients with occult or overt HBV infection. If confirmed , these data suggest the hsa-miR-125a-5p may be a novel biomarker of hepatic damage.
