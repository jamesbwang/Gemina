 The feasibility of computed tomography ( CT) to identify common bile duct ( CBD) and comparison with ultrasonography results were evaluated in normal beagle dogs and dogs without hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases. In addition , CBD diameters obtained from CT at the level of porta hepatis and duodenal papilla level in dogs with underlying diseases which may cause cholestasis. US is useful modality to estimate gallbladder volume , because ejection fraction and CBD diameter were not significantly different with the results of CT.. The normal biliary<disease> tract was visible on CT images in 68 % of normal group dogs. CBD diameter is not over 3 mm and 3.5 mm at porta hepatis and duodenal papilla level in normal dogs weighing less than 15 kg. The dogs suspected to have cholestasis by hepatobiliary or pancreatic diseases had significantly larger CBD than in normal dogs.
