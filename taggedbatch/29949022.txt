 The aim of this study was to fully characterize the mechanical behavior of an external hexagonal implant connection ( ø3 .5 mm , 10-mm length) with an in vitro study , a three-dimensional finite element analysis , and a probabilistic fatigue<symptom> study. Ten implant-abutment assemblies were randomly divided into two groups , five were subjected to a fracture test to obtain the maximum fracture load , and the remaining were exposed to a fatigue<symptom> test with 360,000 cycles of 150 ± 10 N. After mechanical cycling , all samples were attached to the torque-testing machine and the removal torque was measured in Newton centimeters. A finite element analysis ( FEA) was then executed in ANSYS ® to verify all results obtained in the mechanical tests. Finally , due to the randomness of the fatigue<symptom> phenomenon , a probabilistic fatigue<symptom> model was computed to obtain the probability of failure associated with each cycle load. FEA demonstrated that the fracture corresponded with a maximum stress of 2454 MPa obtained in the in vitro fracture test. Mean life was verified by the three methods. Results obtained by the FEA , the in vitro test , and the probabilistic approaches were in accordance. Under these conditions , no mechanical etiology failure is expected to occur up to 100,000 cycles. Graphical abstract ᅟ.
