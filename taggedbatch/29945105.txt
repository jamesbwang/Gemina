 Currently , the growing demand on quick , easy and ecological sample pretreatment methods is unquestionable. Such challenge involves also approaches focusing on the analysis of pharmaceuticals and other endogenous compounds in biological matrices , termed as Bioanalysis. Solvent extraction such as liquid-liquid extraction ( LLE) , derived liquid phase microextraction ( LPME) and related approaches such as solid liquid extraction ( SLE) , proved to be applicable in bioanalysis , as numerous papers have been published in this field. However , their manual performances may suffer from a long-term and laborious preparation , due to the inherent complexity of the biological samples. A high sample-throughput ( enabling measurement of tens or hundreds of samples on a daily basis) can be achieved when automation of sample pretreatment is performed , resulting in decreased imprecision and low waste production of hazardous solvents and risky biological materials. Here , robotic systems have a key role , especially when multiple processing ( e.g. , 96-well plate format) and coupling to modern analytical instrumentation ( e.g. LC-MS) are combined. A thorough overview on the up-to-date automations of LLE , LPME , SLE and solid LLE via robotics , is therefore presented. Pharmaceuticals and related compounds determined in classical liquid biological samples ( i.e. plasma/serum , whole blood , urine , saliva etc.) and modern dried matrix spots ( DMS) were considered as analytes of interest. The methodologies were critically compared to manual setups and among themselves.
