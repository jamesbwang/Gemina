 Metaflammation in adipose tissue , which is characterized by increased local gene expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory factors , may contribute to the increased risk of metabolic complications in obesity. It has been suggested that IL-1β might induce metaflammation in adipose tissue via modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. In our study , the mRNA and secretion levels of major pro-inflammatory factors including IL ( interleukin) -1 β , IL-6 , IL-8 , MCP ( monocyte chemoattractant protein) -1 and RANTES ( regulated on activation , normal T cell expressed and secreted) were measured as indicators of the inflammatory profile. We herein showed that IL-1β could induce adipose tissue metaflammation by enhancing the inflammatory profile of preadipocytes. Moreover , IL-1β could enhance pro-inflammatory gene expression by increasing the phosphorylation or decreasing the methylation of relA ( NF-κB p65) of the NF-κB signaling pathway. VDR ( vitamin D receptor) ligands have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties in adipocytes. Likewise , our study demonstrated that the inflammatory profile of IL-1β-stimulated preadipocytes is significantly attenuated by VDR ligands 1α ,25 ( OH)
