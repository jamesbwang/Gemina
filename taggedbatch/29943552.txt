 The hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) envelope contains small ( S) , middle ( M) , and large ( L) proteins. PreS1 of the L protein contains a receptor-binding motif crucial for HBV infection. This motif is highly conserved among 10 HBV<pathogen> genotypes ( A-J) , making it a potential target for the prevention of HBV infection. In this study , we successfully generated a neutralizing human monoclonal antibody ( mAb) , 1A8 ( IgG1) , that recognizes the receptor-binding motif of preS1 using a phage-displayed human synthetic Fab library. Analysis of the antigen-binding activity of 1A8 for different genotypes indicates that it can specifically bind to the preS1 of major HBV genotypes ( A-D). Based on Bio-Layer interferometry , the affinity ( K
