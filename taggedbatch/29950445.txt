 Patient mortality rates have remained stubbornly high ( 40 %) for the past 35 years in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC) due to inherent or acquired drug resistance. Thus , a critical issue in advanced SCC is to identify and target the mechanisms that contribute to therapy resistance. We report that the transcriptional inhibitor , E2F7 , is mislocalized to the cytoplasm in > 80 % of human HNSCCs , whereas the transcriptional activator , E2F1 , retains localization to the nucleus in SCC. This results in an imbalance in the control of E2F-dependent targets such as
