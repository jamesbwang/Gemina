 The clinical management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC) is hampered by the lack of reliable biomarkers. This study investigated the value of soluble stroma-related molecules as PDAC biomarkers. In the first exploratory phase , 12 out of 38 molecules were associated with PDAC in a cohort of 25 PDAC patients and 16 healthy subjects. A second confirmatory phase on an independent cohort of 131 PDAC patients , 30 chronic pancreatitis<disease> patients , and 131 healthy subjects confirmed the PDAC association for MMP7 , CCN2 , IGFBP2 , TSP2 , sICAM1 , TIMP1 , and PLG Multivariable logistic regression model identified biomarker panels discriminating respectively PDAC versus healthy subjects ( MMP7 + CA19 .9 , AUC = 0.99 , 99 % CI = 0.98-1.00) ( CCN2 + CA19 .9 , AUC = 0.96 , 99 % CI = 0.92-0.99) and PDAC versus chronic pancreatitis<disease> ( CCN2 + PLG+FN+C ol4 + CA19 .9 , AUC = 0.94 , 99 % CI = 0.88-0.99). Five molecules were associated with PanIN development in two GEM models of PDAC ( PdxCre/LSL-Kras
