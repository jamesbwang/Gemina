 Determine whether hospitals are increasing the duration of observation stays following index admission for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> to avoid potential payment penalties from the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program. The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program applies a 30-day cutoff after which readmissions are no longer penalized. Given this seemingly arbitrary cutoff , we use regression discontinuity design , a quasi-experimental research design that can be used to make causal inferences. The High Value Healthcare Collaborative includes member healthcare systems covering 57 % of the nation 's hospital referral regions. We used Medicare claims data including all patients residing within these regions. The study included patients with index admissions for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> from January 1 , 2012 to June 30 , 2015 and a subsequent observation stay within 60 days. We excluded hospitals with fewer than 25 heart<symptom> failure<symptom> readmissions in a year or fewer than 5 observation stays in a year and patients with subsequent observation stays at a different hospital. Overall , there was no discontinuity at the 30-day cutoff in the duration of observation stays , the percent of observation stays over 12 hours , or the percent of observation stays over 24 hours. In the sub-analysis , the discontinuity was significant for non-penalized. The findings reveal evidence that the HRRP has resulted in an increase in the duration of observation stays for some non-penalized hospitals.
