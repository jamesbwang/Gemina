 Through vial impedance spectroscopy ( TVIS) is a product non-invasive process analytical technology which exploits the frequency dependence of the complex impedance spectrum of a composite object ( i.e. the freeze-drying vial and its contents) in order to track the progression of the freeze-drying cycle. This work demonstrates the use of a dual electrode system , attached to the external surface of a type I glass tubing vial ( nominal capacity 10 mL) in the prediction of ( i) the ice interface temperatures at the sublimation front and at the base of the vial , and ( ii) the primary drying rate. A value for the heat transfer coefficient ( for a chamber pressure of 270 Âµbar) was then calculated from these parameters and shown to be comparable to that published by Tchessalov ( 2017).
