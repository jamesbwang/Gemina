 Animal models suggest that gut microbiota contribute to obesity; however , a consistent taxonomic signature of obesity has yet to be identified in humans. We examined whether a taxonomic signature of obesity is present across two independent study populations. We assessed gut microbiome from stool<symptom> for 599 adults , by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We compared gut microbiome diversity , overall composition , and individual taxon abundance for obese ( BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m
