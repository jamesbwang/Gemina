 The ongoing shrinkage in the size of two-dimensional ( 2D) electronic circuitry results in high power densities during device operation , which could cause a significant temperature rise within 2D channels. One challenge in Raman thermometry of 2D materials is that the commonly used high-frequency modes do not precisely represent the temperature rise in some 2D materials because of peak broadening and intensity weakening at elevated temperatures. In this work , we show that a low-frequency E
