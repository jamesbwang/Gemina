 To evaluate the ability of OCT optic nerve head ( ONH) and macular parameters to detect disease progression in eyes with advanced structural glaucomatous damage of the circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer ( cRNFL). Longitudinal study. Forty-four eyes from 37 patients with advanced average cRNFL damage ( ≤ 60 μm) followed up for an average of 4.0 years. All patients were examined with spectral-domain OCT and visual field ( VF) assessment during at least 4 visits. Visual field mean deviation ( MD) and VF index. OCT cRNFL ( average , superior , and inferior quadrants) , ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer ( GCIPL) ( average , superior , and inferior) , rim area , cup volume , average cup-to-disc ( C :D) ratio , and vertical C :D ratio. At baseline , patients had a median VF MD of -10.18 dB and mean cRNFL of 54.55 ± 3.42 μm. The rate of change for MD and VF index were significant. No significant rate of change was noted for cRNFL , whereas significant ( P < 0.001) rates were detected for GCIPL ( -0.57 ± 0.05 μm/year) and ONH parameters such as rim area ( -0.010 ± 0.001 mm Macula GCIPL and ONH parameters may be useful in tracking progression in patients with advanced glaucoma.
