 Arid ecosystems constitute 41 % of land 's surface and play an important role in global carbon cycle. In particular , biological soil crusts ( BSC) are known to be a hotspot of carbon fixation as well as mineralization in arid ecosystems. However , little information is available on carbon decomposition and microbes in BSC and key controlling variables for microbial activities in arid ecosystems. The current study , carried out in South Mediterranean arid ecosystem , aimed to evaluate the effects of intact and removed cyanobacteria/lichen crusts on soil properties , soil enzyme activities , and microbial abundances ( bacteria and fungi<pathogen>). We compared five different treatments ( bare soil , soil with intact cyanobacteria , soil with cyanobacteria removed , soil with intact lichens , and soil with lichens removed) in four different soil layers ( 0-5 , 5-10 , 10-15 , and 15-20 cm). Regardless of soil treatments , activities of hydrolases and water content increased with increasing soil depth. The presence of lichens increased significantly hydrolase activities , which appeared to be associated with greater organic matter , nitrogen , and water contents. However , phenol oxidase was mainly controlled by pH and oxygen availability. Neither fungal nor bacterial abundance exhibited a significant correlation with enzyme activities suggesting that soil enzyme activities are mainly controlled by edaphic and environmental conditions rather than source microbes. Interestingly , the presence of lichens reduced the abundance of bacteria of which mechanism is still to be investigated.
