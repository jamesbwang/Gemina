 Collaboration between general practitioners and community pharmacists is essential to ensure safe and effective patient care. However , collaboration in primary care is not standardized and varies greatly. This review aims to highlight projects about professional collaboration in ambulatory care in Germany and identifies promising approaches and successful benchmarks that should be considered for future projects. A systematic literature search was performed based on the PRISMA guidelines to identify articles focusing on professional collaboration between general practitioners and pharmacists. A total of 542 articles were retrieved. Six potential premises for successful cooperation projects were identified: GP and CP knowing each other ( I) , involvement of both health care providers in the project planning ( II) , sharing of experience or concerns during regular joint meetings enabling continuing evaluation and adaption ( III) , ensuring ( technical) feasibility ( IV) , particularly by providing incentives ( V) , and by integrating these projects into existing health care structures ( VI). Only few studies have been published in scientific journals. There was no standardized assessment of how the participants perceived their collaboration and how it facilitates their daily work , even when the study aimed to evaluate GP-CP collaboration. Successful cooperation between GP and CP in daily routine care was often characterized by personal contact and longtime relationships. Therefore , collaborative teaching sessions at university might establish sympathy and mutual understanding right from the beginning. There is a strong need to establish standardized tools to evaluate collaboration in future projects and to enable comparability of different studies.
