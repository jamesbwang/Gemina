 We previously demonstrated that the phase of oscillations modulates neural activity representing categorical information using human intracranial recordings and high-frequency activity from local field potentials ( Watrous et al. , 2015b). We extend these findings here using human single-neuron recordings during a virtual navigation task. We identify neurons in the medial temporal lobe with firing-rate modulations for specific navigational goals , as well as for navigational planning and goal arrival. Going beyond this work , using a novel oscillation detection algorithm , we identify phase-locked neural firing that encodes information about a person 's prospective navigational goal in the absence of firing rate changes. These results provide evidence for navigational planning and contextual accounts of human MTL function at the single-neuron level. More generally , our findings identify phase-coded neuronal firing as a component of the human neural code.
