 Protein-protein interactions are an important mechanism for the regulation of enzyme function allowing metabolite channeling , crosstalk between pathways or the introduction of post-translational modifications. Therefore , a number of high-throughput studies have been carried out to shed light on the protein networks established under different pathophysiological settings. Surprisingly , this type of information is quite limited for enzymes of intermediary metabolism such as betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase , despite its high hepatic abundancy and its role in homocysteine metabolism. Here , we have taken advantage of two approaches , affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry and yeast two-hybrid , to further uncover the array of interactions of betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase in normal liver of Rattus<pathogen> norvegicus<pathogen>. A total of 131 non-redundant putative interaction targets were identified , out of which 20 were selected for further validation by coimmunoprecipitation. Interaction targets validated by two different methods include: S-methylmethionine homocysteine methyltransferase or betaine homocysteine methyltransferase 2 , methionine adenosyltransferases α1 and α2 , cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha , 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase and aldolase b. Network analysis identified 122 nodes and 165 edges , as well as a limited number of KEGG pathways that comprise: the biosynthesis of amino acids , cysteine and methionine metabolism , the spliceosome and metabolic pathways. These results further expand the connections within the hepatic methionine cycle and suggest putative cross-talks with additional metabolic pathways that deserve additional research.
