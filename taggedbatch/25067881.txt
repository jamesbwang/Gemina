 Although hemodynamic influence of the subprosthetic tissue , termed as pannus , may contribute to prosthetic aortic valve dysfunction , the relationship between pannus extent and hemodynamics in the prosthetic valve has rarely been reported. We investigated the fluid dynamics of pannus formation using in vitro experiments with particle image velocimetry. Subvalvular pannus formation caused substantial changes in prosthetic valve transvalvular peak velocity , transvalvular pressure gradient ( TPG) and opening angle. Maximum flow velocity and corresponding TPG were mostly affected by pannus width. When the pannus width was 25 % of the valve diameter , pannus formation elevated TPG to > 2.5 times higher than that without pannus formation. Opening dysfunction was observed only for a pannus involvement angle of 360 °. Although circumferential pannus with an involvement angle of 360 ° decreased the opening angle of the valve from approximately 82 ° to 58 ° , eccentric pannus with an involvement angle of 180 ° did not induce valve opening dysfunction. The pannus involvement angle largely influenced the velocity flow field at the aortic sinus and corresponding hemodynamic indices , including wall shear stress , principal shear stress and viscous energy loss distributions. Substantial discrepancy between the velocity-based TPG estimation and direct pressure measurements was observed for prosthetic valve flow with pannus formation.
