 Suicide is 1 of the top 3 leading causes of death in the pediatric population and a serious public health concern. There are evidence-based screening tools for suicide in the pediatric population; however , predicting suicide risks can be a difficult task. The emergency department is an essential source of mental health care for youths and can serve as an important opportunity for suicide screening and subsequent targeted interventions and resource management. More research is needed in emergency department-based screening algorithms and evidence-driven interventions in the pediatric population.
