 This study assessed the influence of wilting , lactobacillus<pathogen> ( LAB) and/ or molasses on the chemical composition , phenolic compounds , in situ degradability and in vitro ruminal fermentation parameters of amaranth ( var. Maria) silage using a randomized complete block design with 6 replicates. Treatments were fresh amaranth forage ( FAF) , ensiled amaranth without additive ( EA) , EA inoculated with LAB ( EAB) , EA + 5 % of molasses ( EAM) , EA inoculated with LAB + 5 % of molasses ( EABM) and 24-h wilted EA ( WEA). The ensiled materials were stored anaerobically for a period of 45 d. Chemical composition , oxalic acid and nitrate levels , silage fermentation characteristics , DM disappearance ( DMD) , OM disappearance ( OMD) , in vitro ruminal ammonia-N , VFA , cellulolytic bacteria and protozoa counts , and in situ DM and CP degradability were determined. Compared with FAF , EA had a lesser values of water-soluble carbohydrates ( P = 0.023) , nitrate ( P = 0.001) , total phenolics ( P = 0.04) , total tannins ( P = 0.01) , DMD ( P = 0.01) , ruminal cellulolytic bacteria ( P = 0.02) , soluble and very rapidly degradable fraction ( P = 0.014) , and effective degradability ( P = 0.01). The EA had lesser OMD and CP degradability compared with FAF ( P < 0.05). Adding molasses to EA resulted in increased ash and lactate concentrations and decreased ammonia<pathogen> ( P < 0.05) , but had no effect on OMD. The WEA had lesser ammonia<pathogen> and greater lactate compared to EA ( P < 0.05). Overall , fresh amaranth var. Maria can be preserved as a valuable silage to feed ruminants. Ensiling amaranth var. Maria decreased the anti-quality compounds , and molasses addition improved the fermentation quality of the silage.
