 LINE-1 mobile genetic elements have shaped the mammalian genome during evolution. A minority of them have escaped fossilization which , when activated , can threaten genome integrity. We report that LINE-1 are expressed in substantia nigra ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons , a class of neurons that degenerate in Parkinson 's disease. In
