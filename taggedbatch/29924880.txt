 Seed and pollen dispersal shape patterns of gene flow and genetic diversity in plants. Pollen is generally thought to travel longer distances than seeds , but seeds determine the ultimate location of gametes. Resolving how interactions between these two dispersal processes shape microevolutionary processes is a long-standing research priority. We unambiguously isolated the separate and combined contributions of these two dispersal processes in seedlings of the animal-dispersed palm Oenocarpus bataua to address two questions. First , what is the spatial extent of pollen versus seed movement in a system characterized by long-distance seed dispersal? Second , how does seed dispersal mediate seedling genetic diversity? Despite evidence of frequent long-distance seed dispersal , we found that pollen moves much further than seeds. Nonetheless , seed dispersal ultimately mediates genetic diversity and fine-scale spatial genetic structure. Compared to undispersed seedlings , seedlings dispersed by vertebrates were characterized by higher female gametic and diploid seedling diversity and weaker fine-scale spatial genetic structure for female gametes , male gametes and diploid seedlings. Interestingly , the diversity of maternal seed sources at seed deposition sites ( N
