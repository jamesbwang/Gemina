 Pantoea<pathogen> ananatis<pathogen> , a cause of center rot of onion , is problematic in the USA and elsewhere. The bacterium<pathogen> lacks disease determinants common to most other bacterial pathogens of plants. A genomic island<disease> containing the gene pepM was detected within many onion-pathogenic strains of P.<pathogen> ananatis<pathogen> of diverse origins. The pepM gene of P.<pathogen> ananatis putatively encodes a protein that converts phosphoenolpyruvate to phosphonopyruvate , the first step in the biosynthesis of phosphonates and related molecules. This gene appears to be essential for center rot disease. Deletion of pepM rendered the mutant strain unable to cause lesions<symptom> in leaves of growing onions and water-soaking of inoculated yellow onion bulbs. Furthermore , growth of the deletion mutant in onion leaves was significantly diminished compared to wild-type bacteria , and the mutant failed to cause cell death in tobacco. Complementation of the mutated strain with pepM restored the phenotype to wild-type capability. The pepM gene is the first pathogenicity gene identified that affects bacterial fitness as well as symptom development in both leaves and bulbs in a pathogen causing center rot of onion.
