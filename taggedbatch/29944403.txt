 The present study was performed to detect and characterize the serotypes of fowl adenovirus<pathogen> associated with inclusion body hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> ( IBH) or hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome<disease><symptom> ( HHS) in commercial poultry in some regions of China between 2007 and 2017. Approximately 81 fowl adenovirus<pathogen> strains were isolated from liver or kidney samples from diseased poultry. A sequencing analysis of the hexon loop 1 gene revealed fowl adenovirus<pathogen> serotypes 8a , 8b , and 11 in samples of broilers with IBH , serotype 11 in layers with IBH , and serotype 4 in poultry with HHS. Of the fowl adenovirus<pathogen> serotype 4 strains , 62.07 % were isolated from layers. Additionally , 74.07 % of the isolated strains were fowl adenovirus<pathogen> serotype 11 prior to June 2014; 53.70 % were serotype 4 after that time point; and strains isolated in the first half of 2017 were all serotype 8b , which was related to the widespread application of inactivated serotype 4 adenovirus<pathogen> vaccines. These results demonstrate that fowl adenovirus<pathogen> serotypes 11 , 4 , and 8b were the predominant serotypes in some regions of China between 2007 and June 2014 , between June 2014 and 2016 , and in the first half of 2017 , respectively. Layers were the predominant host infected with fowl adenovirus<pathogen> serotype 4 and could also be infected by serotype 11.
