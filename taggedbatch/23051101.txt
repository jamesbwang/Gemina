 Fibromyalgia ( FM) is characterized by chronic widespread pain , unrefreshing sleep , physical exhaustion<symptom> , and cognitive difficulties. It occurs in all populations throughout the world , with prevalence between 2 % and 4 % in general populations. Definition , pathogenesis , diagnosis , and treatment of FM remain points of contention , with some even contesting its existence. The various classification systems according to pain medicine , psychiatry , and neurology ( pain disease; persistent somatoform pain disorder; masked depression<symptom>; somatic symptom disorder; small fiber neuropathy; brain disease) mostly capture only some components of this complex and heterogeneous disorder. The diagnosis can be established in most cases by a general practitioner when the symptoms meet recognized criteria and a somatic disease sufficiently explaining the symptoms is excluded. Evidence-based interdisciplinary guidelines give a strong recommendation for aerobic exercise and cognitive behavioral therapies. Drug therapy is not mandatory. Only a minority of patients experience substantial symptom relief with duloxetine , milnacipran , and pregabalin.
