 Some patients with moyamoya disease ( MMD) show broad infarction with moderate internal carotid artery ( ICA) stenosis , whereas others with complete ICA occlusion show no infarction. This suggests that other factors contribute to the occurrence of infarction. Contributing factors predictive of cerebral infarcts must be identified for the prevention of infarction and the consequent neurological deficits. We examined data from 93 patients with confirmed MMD for the presence of infarction ( The incidence of PCA steno-occlusive lesions<symptom> was significantly higher in infarcted ( 77.8 %) than in non-infarcted hemispheres ( TIA , 14.6 %; asymptomatic , 9.8 %; hemorrhagic 9.1 %; This is the multivariate statistical analysis study identifying PCA steno-occlusive lesions<symptom> as the most important independent factor that is predictive to cerebral infarction in moyamoya patients. The prediction and inhibition of PCA steno-occlusive changes may help to prevent cerebral infarction.
