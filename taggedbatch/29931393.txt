 A microsporidium was found in a Mediterranean cricket Gryllus bimaculatus from a pet market in the UK and a lab stock at the Moscow Zoo ( originating from London Zoo). The spores were ovoid , uninucleate , 6.3 × 3.7 μm in size ( unfixed) , in packets by of 8 , 16 , or 32. The spores were easily discharged upon dessication or slight mechanical pressure. The polar tube was isofilar , with 15-16 coils arranged in 1-2 rows. The polaroplast was composed of thin lamellae and occupied about one third of the spore volume. The endospore was 200 nm thick , thinning over the anchoring disc. The exospore was thin , uniform , and with no ornamentation. Phylogenetics based upon small subunit ribosomal RNA ( Genbank accession # MG663123) and RNA polymerase II largest subunit ( # MG664544) genes placed the parasite at the base of the Trachipleistophora/Vavraia lineage. The RPB1 locus was polymorphic but similar genetic structure and identical clones were found in both isolates , confirming their common geographic origin. Due to in insufficient ultrastructural data and prominent divergence from described species , the parasite is provisionally placed to the collective taxon Microsporidium.
