 We sought to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with fecal incontinence ( FI) in the home hospice setting. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients served by a hospice agency. Data on patient characteristics were extracted from hospice medical records. The primary outcome , FI , was assessed routinely during clinical visits to the patient 's home. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient characteristics. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was estimated for FI to examine associations with sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients. A total of 15 432 patients were eligible. Patients were female ( 59.0 %) and 75 years or older ( 23.5 % were 75-84; 39.9 % were 85 +). Most patients with FI indicated incontinence at the time of hospice admission ( 64.5 %; n = 4314) , with the average onset period being approximately 18 days from admission ( mean = 17.9 , standard deviation = 50.6). Increasing age represented a risk factor for FI ( hazard ratio ( HR) = 1.01 ( confidence interval , CI = 1.01-1.01)). The absence of a health-care proxy was associated with an increased risk of FI ( HR = 1.11 ( CI = 1.04-1.19)). Greater risk of FI was observed among patients with dementia ( HR = 1.34 ( 1.24-1.46)) and stroke ( HR = 1.42 ( 1.26-1.60)) compared to patients with cancer. Patients referred to hospice from settings other than the hospital also had a greater risk of FI compared to those referred from the hospital ( HR = 1.17 ( 1.11-1.23)). Fecal incontinence is a highly prevalent condition among home hospice patients and most patients indicated FI upon admission ( median time to detection = 18 days). Further studies are needed to identify modifiable risk factors for FI detection and its symptom management in this patient population.
