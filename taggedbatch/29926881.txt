 An unprecedented copper mediated one-pot sequential synthesis of 1,2,3-triazolo cinnolinone derivatives from 2-halo-phenyl triazoles and terminal alkynes has been reported. Under the optimized reaction conditions , a broad range of substituted triazoles and alkynes were found to participate in this transformation , thus affording unknown 1,2,3-triazolo cinnolinone derivatives in moderate<symptom> to excellent yields. This method proceeds through sequential C-C coupling followed by an annulation cascade sequence in the same vessel under atmospheric air as the sole oxidant , thus representing a simple , efficient and atom economical approach for the synthesis of aza-cinnolinones.
