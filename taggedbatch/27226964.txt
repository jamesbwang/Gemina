 DesignRandomised controlled trial.InterventionPatients aged 12-30 years requiring fixed orthodontic treatment were eligible and were randomly allocated to treatment with the Insignia customised orthodontic system or the Damon Q noncustomised orthodontic system.Outcome measureThe primary outcome measure was treatment duration. Secondary outcomes were quality of treatment result; the degree of improvement graded using the Peer Assessment Rating ( PAR) score; number of visits from the first visit after bonding to debonding; number of loose brackets; time required for treatment planning; and number of complaints.ResultsOne hundred and eighty patients entered the trial. Four were lost to follow-up and two did not complete treatment , so 174 were analysed. Treatment duration was 1.29 ± 0.35 years in the customised group and 1.24 ± 0.37 years in the noncustomised group. The PAR did not differ significantly between groups. However , the orthodontist had a significant effect on treatment duration , quality of treatment outcome and number of visits ( P < 0.05). Compared to the noncustomised group , the customised group had more loose brackets , a longer planning time and more complaints.ConclusionsThe customised orthodontic system was not associated with significantly reduced treatment duration , and treatment quality was comparable between the two systems.
