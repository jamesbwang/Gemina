 Perceptual grouping is fundamental to many auditory processes. The Iambic-Trochaic Law ( ITL) is a default grouping strategy , where rhythmic alternations of duration are perceived iambically ( weak-strong) , while alternations of intensity are perceived trochaically ( strong-weak). Some argue that the ITL is experience dependent. For instance , French speakers follow the ITL , but not as consistently as German speakers. We hypothesized that learning about prosodic patterns , like word stress , modulates this rhythmic grouping. We tested this idea by training French adults on a German-like stress contrast. Individuals who showed better phonological learning had more ITL-like grouping , particularly over duration cues. In a non-phonological condition , French adults were trained using identical stimuli , but they learned to attend to acoustic variation that was not linguistic. Here , no learning effects were observed. Results thus suggest that phonological learning can modulate low-level auditory grouping phenomena , but it is constrained by the ability of individuals to learn from short-term training.
