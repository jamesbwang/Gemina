 Clinical microbiology is a highly challenging technical discipline , which makes it difficult to harmonize processes and protocols. In addition , the lack of scientific consensus on some diagnostic algorithms and the need to address the diverse needs of different patient populations contribute to the lack of interlaboratory consistency. Laboratories utilize a number of measures and metrics , but the lack of standardized approaches and data collection means that they can not effectively evaluate their performance against their peers. Coordinated efforts are required to develop tools that can be used across laboratories regardless of size or complexity.
