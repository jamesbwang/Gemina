 Native Americans from the Amazon , Andes , and coastal geographic regions of South America have a rich cultural heritage but are genetically understudied , therefore leading to gaps in our knowledge of their genomic architecture and demographic history. In this study , we sequence 150 genomes to high coverage combined with an additional 130 genotype array samples from Native American and mestizo populations in Peru. The majority of our samples possess greater than 90 % Native American ancestry , which makes this the most extensive Native American sequencing project to date. Demographic modeling reveals that the peopling of Peru began âˆ¼ 12,000 y ago , consistent with the hypothesis of the rapid peopling of the Americas and Peruvian archeological data. We find that the Native American populations possess distinct ancestral divisions , whereas the mestizo groups were admixtures of multiple Native American communities that occurred before and during the Inca Empire and Spanish rule. In addition , the mestizo communities also show Spanish introgression largely following Peruvian Independence , nearly 300 y after Spain conquered Peru. Further , we estimate migration events between Peruvian populations from all three geographic regions with the majority of between-region migration moving from the high Andes to the low-altitude Amazon and coast. As such , we present a detailed model of the evolutionary dynamics which impacted the genomes of modern-day Peruvians and a Native American ancestry dataset that will serve as a beneficial resource to addressing the underrepresentation of Native American ancestry in sequencing studies.
