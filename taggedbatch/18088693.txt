 The conservative management of large , odontogenic , developmental cysts<symptom> involving the jaws in young children using the technique of decompression has become increasingly popular to reduce the incidence of morbidity associated with aggressive treatment modalities. The lack of development of a stock device has made clinicians to explore various possible and readily available materials to customize the devices. This paper highlights the use of a novel material to be used as a decompression device that is readily available and can be used with good patient compliance and a predictable outcome.
