 Drawing on fieldwork in the postsocialist Czech Republic , we explore the transformative processes of biomedicalization , both within and in relation to complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM). We argue that it would be simplistic to understand evidence of these processes in CAM as a sign that CAM has fallen prey to biomedicine. Instead , we show how particular CAM practices play a groundbreaking role in shaping developments in contemporary health care. In this respect , we question the utility of the concept of biomedicalization , arguing that it reduces the transformative processes to aspects of biomedicine.
