 According to some specialists , ceremonial funeral practices are inclined to disappear , particularly as death is an object of repression in contemporary society. However , it seems that new forms of rituals are developing through modern technologies. Virtual tombs , memorial webpages , and the celebration of death anniversaries are now common currency on the Internet. Nonetheless , the overexposure favored by the Web seems to question traditional ways of `` living out '' one 's grief , subjecting the living and the dead to a redefinition of concepts of time and space , and entailing new forms of interaction.
