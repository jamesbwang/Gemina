 Infantile hemangioma can be linked to other organ malformations. In 1996 , PHACE syndrome<disease><symptom> was first defined as the association of large and segmental infantile hemangioma , usually on the face , head , or cervical region , with malformations of the posterior fossa of the brain , arterial anomalies of the central nervous system , coarctation of the aorta , cardiac defects , and ocular abnormalities. Over 300 cases of PHACE syndrome<disease><symptom> have been reported , and it is cconsidered one of the most common neurocutaneous vascular disorders in childhood. Knowledge of the features and locations of lesions<symptom> that imply a greater risk of systemic involvement is crucial for the diagnosis and proper management of PHACE syndrome<disease><symptom> patients. This review highlights the diagnostic criteria for PHACE syndrome<disease><symptom> , the imaging workup for extracutaneous involvement , the treatment of infantile hemangioma , and the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the management of these patients.
