 Lactobacillus<pathogen> casei<pathogen> ( L.<pathogen> casei) is well known for its probiotic property in human and animals. Lactoferricin ( Lfcin) polypeptide can effectively modulate host immune responses and have antimicrobial activity in vivo and in vitro. In order to develop a food-grade L.<pathogen> casei<pathogen> system constitutively expressing bovine Lfcin , this study constructed a thymidine auxotrophy ( ΔthyA) recombinant L.<pathogen> casei<pathogen>. Based on the thymidylate synthase gene ( thyA) insert site , LFEC ( Lfcin expression cassette) was inserted into L.<pathogen> casei<pathogen> genome through homologous recombination , successfully expressed and could be stably inherited. The recombinant L.<pathogen> casei<pathogen> , ΔthyA L. casei-LFEC , is sensitive to chloramphenicol and limited when cultured without thymine. Meanwhile , ΔthyA L. casei-LFEC has both good antibacterial activity against Escherichia<pathogen> coli and Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and antiviral activity against porcine epidemic diarrhea<disease><symptom> virus ( PEDV). We successfully constructed a recombinant L.<pathogen> casei<pathogen> strain expressing Lfcin , ΔthyA L. casei-LFEC , which could only survive in the presence of thymine , and had excellent antimicrobial and antiviral activity with good genetic stability and sensitivity. This research provides a cost-effective alternative to the antibiotics with additional biological functions and wider applicability prospect. Using ΔthyA as the selectable mark instead of antibiotic to construct genetic engineering L.casei provides a safe and effective approach of feed additives in livestock raising.
