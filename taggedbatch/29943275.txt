 Grifola frondosa is an edible fungus with a variety of potential pharmacological activities. This study investigates the hypoglycemic , anti-diabetic nephritic , and antioxidant properties of G. frondosa polysaccharides in diet-streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. After a 4-week treatment with 100 mg/kg of metformin and 200 mg/kg of one of four different G. frondosa polysaccharide mixtures ( especially GFPS3 and GFPS4) , diabetic rats had enhanced body<symptom> weight and suppressed plasma glucose , indicating the hypoglycemic activities of the G. frondosa polysaccharides. G. frondosa polysaccharides regulated the level of serum creatinine , blood urea nitrogen , N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase , and albuminuria; inhibited the serum levels of interleukin ( IL) -2 , IL-6 , and TNF-α; and enhanced the serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and interferon-α , confirming their anti-diabetic nephritic activities. G. frondosa polysaccharides ameliorated the pathological alterations in the kidneys of diabetic rats. Moreover , G. frondosa polysaccharides modulated the serum levels of oxidant factors such as superoxide dismutase , glutathione peroxidase , catalase , malondialdehyde , and reactive oxygen species , revealing their antioxidant properties. Furthermore , the administration of G. frondosa polysaccharides inhibited nuclear factor kappa B activities in the serum and kidneys. All of the data revealed that the activation of nuclear factor kappa B plays a central role in G. frondosa polysaccharide-mediated anti-diabetic and anti-nephritic activities.
