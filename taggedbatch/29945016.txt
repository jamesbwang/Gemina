 Electrochemically anodized titanium surfaces with titania nanostructures ( TNS; nanopores , nanotubes , etc.) have been widely applied as therapeutic bone/dental implant modifications. Despite the numerous advancements in the field of electrochemical anodization ( EA) , in terms of translation into the current implant market , research gaps in this domain include the lack of fabrication optimization , performed on a substrate of conventional implant surface/geometry , and inadequate mechanical stability. In the current study , we investigate the role of substrate pre-treatment on achieving desired nanotopographies for the purpose of reproducing optimized nanostructures on the complex geometry of commercial implant surfaces , as well as in-depth mechanical stability testing of these nano-engineered coatings. The results confirmed that: ( a) substrate polishing/smoothening may be insignificant with respect to fabrication of well-ordered and high quality TNS on micro-rough implants with preserved underlying micro-roughness; ( b) optimized outcomes can be successfully translated onto complex geometries characteristic of the current implant market , including dental implant abutments and screws ( also applicable to a wider implant market including orthopaedics); ( c) mechanical stability testing revealed improved modulus and hardness values as compared to conventional nanotubes/pores. We believe that such optimization advances the existing knowledge of titanium anodization and anodized implants towards integration into the current implant market and successful clinical translation.
