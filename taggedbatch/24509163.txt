 The usual way to present images from a scanning tunneling microscope ( STM) is to take multiple images of the same area , to then manually select the one that appears to be of the highest quality , and then to discard the other almost identical images. This is in contrast to most other disciplines where the signal to noise ratio ( SNR) of a data set is improved by taking repeated measurements and averaging them. Data averaging can be routinely performed for 1D spectra , where their alignment is straightforward. However , for serial-acquired 2D STM images the nature and variety of image distortions can severely complicate accurate registration. Here , we demonstrate how a significant improvement in the resolving power of the STM can be achieved through automated distortion correction and multi-frame averaging ( MFA) and we demonstrate the broad utility of this approach with three examples. First , we show a sixfold enhancement of the SNR of the Si ( 111)- ( 7 Ã— 7) reconstruction. Next , we demonstrate that images with sub-picometre height precision can be routinely obtained and show this for a monolayer of Ti
