 The synthesis , structure , and magnetic properties of two mononuclear cobalt ( ii) complexes ( Co ( LSal,2-Ph) 2) ( 1) and ( Co ( LNph,2-Ph) 2) ( 2) are reported. The utilized sterically demanding Schiff-base ligands HLSal,2-Ph ( 2- ( ( ( 1,1 '- biphenyl) -2-ylimino) methyl) phenol) and HLNph,2-Ph ( 1- ( ( ( 1,1 '- biphenyl) -2-ylimino) methyl) naphthalen-2-ol) lead to a strong distortion of the ( N2O2) coordination environment in the complexes 1 and 2 , which can be primarily attributed to the variation in the dihedral angle between the planes of the two chelate ligands. Magnetic susceptibility and FD-FT THz-EPR measurements as well as ab initio calculations reveal that both complexes exhibit an easy-axis type of anisotropy. For both compounds frequency-dependent ac susceptibility measurements show an out-of-phase susceptibility under applied static fields of 400 and 1000 Oe. A detailed analysis of the underlying relaxation process is given , revealing significant differences in the contributions of Orbach , Raman , and direct processes within the observed temperature range. Fitting of the magnetic data leads to a spin-reversal barrier of 49 cm-1 for 1 at an applied field of 1000 Oe. For 2 the barrier is not well defined by the analysis of the relaxation times and is , therefore , approximated by the experimental barrier derived from FD-FT THz-EPR measurements ( 62.8 cm-1). The results from ab initio calculations and FD-FT THz-EPR measurements show that the distortion of the coordination sphere in complexes 1 and 2 from the pseudotetrahedral towards a square-planar coordination geometry leads to an increase in both the axial ( D) and the rhombic zero-field splitting ( E).
