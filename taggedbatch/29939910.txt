 Although the life expectancy for the US population has increased , a high proportion of this population has lived with â‰¥ 1 chronic conditions. We have quantified the burden of disease associated with 15 chronic conditions and combinations of conditions by estimating quality-adjusted life years ( QALYs) for older US adults. Data were from the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey Cohort 15 ( baseline survey in 2012 , follow-up survey 2014 , with mortality follow-up through January 31 , 2015). We included individuals aged 65 years and older ( n = 96,481). We estimated mean QALY throughout the remainder of the lifetime according to the occurrence of these conditions. The age-adjusted QALY was 5.8 years for men and 7.8 years for women. Over 90 % respondents reported at least 1 condition and 72 % reported multiple conditions. Respondents with depression<symptom> and congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> had the lowest age-adjusted QALY ( 1.1-1.5 y for men and 1.5-2.2 y for women) , whereas those with hypertension , arthritis<disease><symptom> , and sciatica had higher QALY ( 4.2-5.4 and 6.4-7.2 y , respectively). Having either depression<symptom> or congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and any 1 or 2 of the other 13 conditions was associated with the lowest QALY among the possible dyads and triads of chronic conditions. Dyads and triads with hypertension or arthritis<disease><symptom> were more prevalent , but had higher QALY. Understanding the burden of disease for common chronic conditions and for combinations of these conditions is useful for delivering high-quality primary care that could be tailored for individuals with combinations of chronic conditions.
