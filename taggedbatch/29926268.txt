 Several studies report that patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) have a low plasma concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs). Since fish intake varies among countries and is high in Japan , those results may not apply to Japanese patients with ADHD. However , there is currently not enough evidence to support this. We compared the plasma PUFAs levels of patients with ADHD with the standard reference levels for healthy subjects , and examined the relationship between those PUFAs levels and the subject 's psychological evaluation. The subjects were 24 patients ( age < 20 years) previously diagnosed with ADHD ( according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria) at the psychiatric department of the Nagasaki University Hospital , between November 2010 and November 2015. The plasma concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA) , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA) , and arachidonic acid ( AA) were measured using gas chromatography. Data pertaining to global assessment of functioning ( GAF) , clinical global impressions , ADHD Rating Scale-IV , and the drug used for treatment ( atomoxetine or methylphenidate) were obtained from the medical records. The plasma concentrations of DHA , EPA , and EPA/AA were significantly lower than the normal reference range , indicating that ADHD patients present an imbalance in PUFAs levels. This trend is similar to ADHD patients in other countries and replacement therapy in Japanese ADHD patients may be useful.
