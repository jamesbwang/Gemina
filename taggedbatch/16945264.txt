 The pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) is complex and understanding of it has been changing in recent years , with regard to its multisystemic manifestations , especially peripheral dysfunction and its influence on intolerance to exercise. To evaluate the relationship between peripheral arterial occlusive disease ( PAOD) and peripheral<symptom> muscle strength and exercise capacity in COPD patients. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 35 patients with COPD who were evaluated with the Ankle-Brachial Index , handgrip strength test , 1 repetition maximum ( 1RM) of knee extensors and flexors<symptom> , and distance covered in the incremental shuttle walking test ( dISWT). COPD patients with coexisting PAOD had lower dominant handgrip strength test results ( 33.00 vs. 26.66 kgf , p = 0.02) and worse performance in the dISWT ( 297.32 vs. 219.41 m , p = 0.02) when compared to the COPD patients without PAOD. Strong correlations were found between the result of the handgrip strength test and both the dISWT ( r = 0.78; p < 0.001) and the 1RM/knee extension ( r = 0.71; p = 0.03); and also between the dISWT and both the 1RM/knee extension ( r = 0.72; p = 0.02) and the 1RM/knee flexion ( r = 0.92; p < 0.001). The linear regression model showed that the dISWT variable alone explains 15.3 % of the Ankle-Brachial Index result ( p = 0.01). COPD patients with PAOD exhibit reduced muscle strength and lower exercise capacity than COPD patients without PAOD.
