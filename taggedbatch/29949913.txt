 It is important for elderly people to maintain or improve muscle strength and for clinicians to know the factors that affect muscle strength. Therefore , the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of fat mass ( FM) and skeletal muscle mass ( SMM) on muscle strength. The participants included 192 community-dwelling elderly women. The SMM and FM , grip strength , and knee extension strength were measured. Data were evaluated using stepwise multiple linear regression analysis , which was performed with grip or knee extension strength as a dependent variable and the SMM and FM of the upper and lower limbs as the independent variables. The SMM and FM of the upper limbs were associated with grip strength , whereas the SMM but not the FM of the lower limbs was associated with knee extension strength. These findings suggest that there may be thresholds for the SMM/FM ratio to affect muscle strength.
