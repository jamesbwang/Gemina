 Everolimus , an orally administered mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor , has been widely used as an immunosuppressant and an anticancer agent. Whereas everolimus can control recurrent hypoglycemia in patients with insulinoma , possibly through tumor regression and/or the direct inhibition of insulin secretion , time-dependent changes in serum insulin levels caused by everolimus still remain unclear. Here we report a clinical case of a patient with metastatic insulinoma , in which frequent monitoring of serum insulin levels demonstrated rapid and substantial changes in insulin secretion levels , a few days after the discontinuation as well as the readministration of everolimus. To further confirm the direct effect of everolimus on
