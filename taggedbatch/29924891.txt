 The benefits of digital pathology for workflow improvement and thereby cost savings in pathology , at least partly outweighing investment costs , are increasingly recognized. Successful implementations in a variety of scenarios start to demonstrate cost benefits of digital pathology for both research and routine diagnostics , contributing to a sound business case encouraging further adoption. To further support new adopters , there is still a need for detailed assessment of the impact this technology has on the relevant pathology workflows with emphasis on time saving. To assess the impact of digital pathology adoption on logistic laboratory tasks ( i.e. not including pathologists ' time for diagnosis making) in LabPON , a large regional pathology laboratory in The Netherlands. To quantify the benefits of digitization we analyzed the differences between the traditional analog and new digital workflows , carried out detailed measurements of all relevant steps in key analog and digital processes , and compared time spent. We modeled and assessed the logistic savings in five workflows: ( 1) Routine diagnosis , ( 2) Multi-disciplinary meeting , ( 3) External revision requests , ( 4) Extra stainings and ( 5) External consultation. On average over 19 working hours were saved on a typical day by working digitally , with the highest savings in routine diagnosis and multi-disciplinary meeting workflows. By working digitally , a significant amount of time could be saved in a large regional pathology lab with a typical case mix. We also present the data in each workflow per task and concrete logistic steps to allow extrapolation to the context and case mix of other laboratories. This article is protected by copyright.
