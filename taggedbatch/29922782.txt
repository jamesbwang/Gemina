 Five new 3D isostructural lanthanide metal organic frameworks ( Ln-MOFs) , ( Ln ( HL) 1.5 ( H2O) ( DMF)) · 2H2O ( Ln = GdIII ( 1) , SmIII ( 2) , DyIII ( 3) , EuIII ( 4) and TbIII ( 5) , H3L = 5- ( 3 ' ,5 '- dicarboxylphenyl) nicotinic acid) were synthesized by solvothermal methods and studied by structural analyses , magnetic analyses and luminescence sensing. Crystallographic studies revealed that these compounds are 3D frameworks in which the LnIII-COO chains with alternating four and two carboxylate bridges are interlinked by the organic ligands L , and contain microporous channels with accessible Lewis-base sites , coordinated water molecules and uncoordinated carboxyl groups , which are easy to combine and recognise various analytes. Magnetic studies demonstrated that the carboxylate bridges transmit interchain dominant ferromagnetic interactions in Gd-MOF ( 1) and Dy-MOF ( 3) , while the decrease of the χT value in Sm-MOF ( 2) is due to the thermal depopulation effect of the excited levels. Furthermore , Dy-MOF ( 3) also shows slow magnetic relaxation behaviour under a zero dc field. The luminescence selective sensing experiments showed that Eu-MOF ( 4) and Tb-MOF ( 5) can act as recyclable sensors towards Fe3 + ions in water and the simulated biological fluids , and towards ketones in a water system with high sensitivity , selectivity and relatively low detection limits.
