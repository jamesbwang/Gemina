 Approximately five to 10 % of all melanomas occur in families with hereditary predisposition and the main high-risk melanoma susceptibility gene is the CDKN2A. To describe , after a five-years study , the clinical data of patients ( probands) from familial melanoma kindreds , and the pathological characteristics of their melanoma. The inclusion criteria were melanoma patients with a family history of melanoma or pancreatic cancer ( first- or second-degree relatives) or patients with multiple primary melanomas ( MPM). A total of 124 probands were studied , where 64 were considered familial cases and 60 MPM. Mean age at diagnosis was 50 years. Our results show that the following characteristics were prevalent: skin phototype I/II ( 89.5 %) , sunburn during childhood ( 85.5 %) , total number of nevi ≥ 50 ( 56.5 %) , Breslow thickness ≤ 1.0 mm ( 70.2 %) , tumors located on the trunk ( 53.2 %) and superficial spreading melanomas ( 70.2 %). Analyses of probands ' relatives will be demonstrated in future publication. Our findings are in agreement with previous familial melanomas reports. Fifteen new melanomas in 11 patients were diagnosed during follow up , all of which were ≤ 1.0 mm. This is the largest dataset of Brazilian melanoma prone kindreds to date , thus providing a complete database for future genetic studies.
