 Rabies<pathogen> is a serious concern to public health and wildlife management worldwide. Over the last three decades , various mathematical models have been proposed to study the transmission dynamics of rabies<pathogen>. In this paper we provide a mini-review on some reaction-diffusion models describing the spatial spread of rabies<pathogen> among animals. More specifically , we introduce the susceptible-exposed-infectious models for the spatial transmission of rabies<pathogen> among foxes ( Murray et al. , 1986) , the spatiotemporal epidemic model for rabies<pathogen> among raccoons ( Neilan and Lenhart , 2011) , the diffusive rabies<pathogen> model for skunk and bat interactions ( Bonchering et al. , 2012) , and the reaction-diffusion model for rabies<pathogen> among dogs ( Zhang et al. , 2012). Numerical simulations on the spatiotemporal dynamics of these models from these papers are presented.
