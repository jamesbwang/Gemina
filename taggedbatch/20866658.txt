 Single-particle tracking offers a noninvasive high-resolution probe of biomolecular reactions inside living cells. However , efficient data analysis methods that correctly account for various noise sources are needed to realize the full quantitative potential of the method. We report algorithms for hidden Markov-based analysis of single-particle tracking data , which incorporate most sources of experimental noise , including heterogeneous localization errors and missing positions. Compared to previous implementations , the algorithms offer significant speedups , support for a wider range of inference methods , and a simple user interface. This will enable more advanced and exploratory quantitative analysis of single-particle tracking data.
