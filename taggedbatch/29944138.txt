 In order to study the influence of different concentrations of zinc and sulfachloropyridazine sodium ( SCPS) on anaerobic digestion ( AD) during biogas production , we determined the levels of urease , dehydrogenase activity , and volatile fatty acids ( VFAs) in batch tests. The experiments were conducted in small AD devices at a temperature of 37 Â°C using swine manure and wheat straw as raw materials. Four digestion trials were performed using different zinc and SCPS contents: control digestion with no additives ( CK) , SCPS at 630 mg kg
