 To study the effects of Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 ( JAK2/STAT3) in exercise preconditioning ( EP) against myocardial apoptosis. Eighty healthy male SD rats were randomly divided into control group ( C) , exercise exhaust ( EE) group , EP group , and EP+JAK 2 inhibitor AG490 ( AG) group ( Compared with group C , myocardial apoptosis , and the expressions of Caspase-3 , p-JAK2 , and p-STAT3 in heart were increased significantly in group EE. Compared with group EE , myocardial apoptosis and the expression of Caspase-3 were decreased significantly , while the expressions of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 were increased significantly in group EP. Compared with group EP , myocardial apoptosis and the expression of Caspase-3 were increased significantly , while the expressions of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 were decreased significantly in group EP+AG. EP could increase the expressions of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 and decrease the expression of Caspase-3 in heart , which further mitigate myocardial apoptosis. Hence , JAK2/STAT3 pathway may participate in EP against myocardial apoptosis.
