 Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> Aat2p contains a peroxisomal targeting signal type-1 and localizes to peroxisomes in oleate-grown cells , but not in glucose-grown cells. Here , we have investigated Aat2p from the yeast Hansenula polymorpha , which lacks a recognizable peroxisomal targeting signal. Aat2p tagged with GFP at its C terminus displays a dual cytosol-peroxisome localization in ethanol-grown cells. The partial peroxisomal localization of Aat2p persisted in the absence of the classical cycling receptors Pex5p and Pex7p but Aat2p targeting to peroxisomes was reduced in cells deleted for the matrix protein import factors PEX1 , PEX2 and PEX13. Furthermore , we demonstrate that Aat2p targeting to peroxisomes requires Pex20p. Together , our data identify a Pex20p-dependent pathway for targeting Aat2p to peroxisomes.
