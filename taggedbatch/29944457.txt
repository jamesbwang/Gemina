 Oncoimmunology is a rapidly growing field , focusing both on studying of the interaction of immune factors with tumor cells and also on the development of new therapies. In this regard , immunotherapy is increasingly used clinically. Although tumorigenesis is generally seen as an autonomous process involving genetically transformed cancer cells , it is increasingly recognized that tumor environment is an essential factor that modulates both tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Tumor-associated immune cells , and in particular macrophages , are of particular importance in all stages of the tumorigenesis process and are also a clinical prognostic marker. From quantification of a single analyte in a given sample to complex platforms comprising multiple techniques , several methods for investigation of the dynamic balance<symptom> and interaction between tumor-associated macrophages ( TAMs) and tumor cells are available. This review presents the techniques carried out currently for investigation of TAMs functions , interactions , and modulation both at translational and transcriptional levels- ELISA and Multiplex assays , flow-cytometry , immunohistochemistry , DNA microarray- as essential steps not only for research purposes but also for predicting the therapeutic efficiency and patient survival.
