 Glyphosate ( N-phosphonomethyl-glycine) ( GLY) is the active ingredient of the most used herbicides in the world. GLY is applied in formulated products known as glyphosate-based herbicides ( GBH) , which could induce effects that are not predicted by toxicity assays with pure GLY. This herbicide is classified as organophosphorus compound , which is known to induce neurotoxic effects. Although this compound is classified as non-neurotoxic by regulatory agencies , acute exposure to GBH causes neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom> in humans. However , there is no consensus in relation to neurotoxic effects of GBH. Thus , the aim of this study was to investigate the neurotoxic effects of the GBH in the zebrafish Danio<pathogen> rerio<pathogen> , focusing on acute toxicity , the activity and transcript levels of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes , mitochondrial membrane potential , reactive species ( RS) formation , and behavioral repertoire. Adult zebrafish were exposed in vivo to three concentrations of GBH Scout
