 Smoking during pregnancy is three times as common among Aboriginal women as non-Aboriginal women , with consequent higher rates of adverse health outcomes. Effective interventions to support Aboriginal women to quit smoking have not yet been identified. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a culturally tailored , intensive smoking cessation program , including contingency-based financial rewards ( CBFR) , for pregnant Aboriginal women. The structured program included frequent support with individually tailored counselling , free nicotine replacement therapy , engagement with household members , specially developed resources , CBFR and peer support groups. It was implemented by three rural Aboriginal Maternal and Infant Health Services sites. Women were eligible if they or their partner were Aboriginal; and if they were: current smokers or had quit since becoming pregnant; > = 16 years old; at < 20 weeks gestation; and locally resident. Data included demographics , obstetrics , initial smoking behaviour , program implementation and quitting behaviour. Self-reported quitting was confirmed by expired carbon monoxide ( CO). Women and staff were interviewed about their experiences. Twenty-two of 38 eligible women ( 58 %) enrolled in the program , with 19 ( 86 % remaining at the end of their pregnancy. The program was highly acceptable to both women and providers. Feasibility issues included challenges providing twice-weekly visits for 3 weeks and running fortnightly support groups. Of the 19 women who completed the program , 15 ( 79 %) reported a quit attempt lasting > = 24 hours , and 8 ( 42 %) were CO-confirmed as not smoking in late pregnancy. The rewards were perceived to help motivate women , but the key to successful quitting was considered to be the intensive support provided. ` Stop Smoking in its Tracks ' was acceptable and is likely to be feasible to implement with some modifications. The program should be tested in a larger study.
