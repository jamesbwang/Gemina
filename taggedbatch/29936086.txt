 We aimed to determine the prevalence of arterial stiffness in young adults with youth-onset type 2 diabetes who previously participated in the TODAY clinical trial and whether arterial stiffness is influenced by their prior diabetes treatment assignment or glycemic control. We measured arterial stiffness by femoral , radial , and foot pulse wave velocity ( PWV) , augmentation index ( AIx) , and brachial distensibility ( BrachD) in 453 TODAY participants ( age 20.8 ± 2.5 years , diabetes duration 7.6 ± 1.5 years , 36.4 % male , BMI 36.7 ± 8.2 kg/m Arterial stiffness was identified in up to 50 % of TODAY participants. Prior diabetes treatment assignment was not associated with higher arterial stiffness. Glycemic control over time was associated with PWV radial and foot only. Age , race-ethnicity , sex , higher blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and BMI were also associated with higher arterial stiffness. Nearly half of TODAY youth have increased arterial stiffness. Targeting blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and perhaps obesity and glycemic control may positively impact arterial health in adolescents with type 2 diabetes. ClinicalTrials.govNCT00081328.
