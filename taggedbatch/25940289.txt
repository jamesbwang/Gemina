 Tumor recurrence and drug resistance are the main causes of death in tumor patients. The family of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase ( ALDH) is closely related to the proliferation , migration , invasion and resistance of tumor cells , and different ALDH subtypes are expressed in different tumor cells. The aim of this study is to elucidate the ALDH subtype in human lung adenocarcinoma HCC-827/ GR cells , which resistant to the gefitinib. The human lung adenocarcinoma HCC-827 cells were used to generate the gefitinib-resistant HCC-827/ GR cells; the expression of ALDH subtype in either HCC-827 or HCC-827/ GR was detected by flow cytometry; The proliferative capacity and sensitivity to gefitinib of hcc-827/ GR cells were analyzed by MTT assay before and after treatment with 100 μmol/L diethyllaminaldehyde ( DEAB); Real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression of ALDH subtypes at mRNA levels in hcc-827 cells and hcc-827/ GR cells. Compared with HCC-827 cells , the positive rate of ALDH in HCC-827/ GR cells increased. The proliferation ability of HCC-827/ GR cells decreased after treatment with 100 μmol/L DEAB. Compared with HCC-827 cells , the expression of ALDH1A1 and ALDH1L1 mRNA was increased in hcc-827/ GR cells , but the ALDH3B2 expression was decreased. ALDH might be used as a molecular biomarker to test the gefitinib-resistant to lung adenocarcinoma cancer cells , and the ALDH1A1 may play a role in gefitinib resistance in lung cancer.
