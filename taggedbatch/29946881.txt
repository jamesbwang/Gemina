 Notable differences have been identified between low-resolution manometry ( LRM) and high-resolution manometry ( HRM) in normative data. This study aimed to investigate within-subject differences between unidirectional LRM and circumferential HRM solid-state measurement sensors in the pharyngoesophageal segment during swallowing. Ten healthy subjects ( mean 26.9 years) were evaluated with both a 2.10 mm unidirectional catheter and a 2.75 mm circumferential catheter , with randomized order of catheter placement. Unidirectional measurements were made in four directions ( posterior , anterior , right-lateral , left-lateral). Pressures and durations were analyzed to compare ( 1) posterior to anterior and lateral recordings and ( 2) posterior and average-LRM measures ( C-LRM) to HRM measures at same anatomical location. No significant differences were found in any of the measures across the four radial directions. A lower amplitude was measured in C-LRM compared to HRM for pharyngeal sensors ( LRM Sensor 1:- 39.7 mmHg; Sensor 2:- 61.4 mmHg). Compared with posterior-LRM , HRM recorded higher UES pressures (- 12.8 mmHg) and longer UES relaxation durations (- 0.31 s). This exploratory study is the first to compare within-subject pressures between unidirectional LRM and circumferential HRM. Substantial differences in pharyngeal<symptom> manometric measures were found , particularly with regard to UES function. This is clinically important as manometry is uniquely able to evaluate UES function and clarify differential diagnoses in patients with dysphagia<symptom>.
