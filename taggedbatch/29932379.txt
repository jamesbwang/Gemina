 OBJECTIVE Although enhanced recovery after surgery ( ERAS) programs have gained acceptance in various surgical specialties , no established neurosurgical ERAS protocol for patients undergoing elective craniotomy has been reported in the literature. Here , the authors describe the design , implementation , safety , and efficacy of a novel neurosurgical ERAS protocol for elective craniotomy in a tertiary care medical center located in China. METHODS A multidisciplinary neurosurgical ERAS protocol for elective craniotomy was developed based on the best available evidence. A total of 140 patients undergoing elective craniotomy between October 2016 and May 2017 were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing this novel protocol to conventional neurosurgical perioperative management. The primary endpoint of this study was the postoperative hospital length of stay ( LOS). Postoperative morbidity , perioperative complications , postoperative pain scores , postoperative nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom> , duration of urinary catheterization , time to first solid meal , and patient satisfaction were secondary endpoints. RESULTS The median postoperative hospital LOS ( 4 days) was significantly shorter with the incorporation of the ERAS protocol than that with conventional perioperative management ( 7 days , p < 0.0001). No 30-day readmission or reoperation occurred in either group. More patients in the ERAS group reported mild<symptom> pain<symptom> ( visual analog scale score 1-3) on postoperative day 1 than those in the control group ( 79 % vs. 33 % , OR 7.49 , 95 % CI 3.51-15.99 , p < 0.0001). Similarly , more patients in the ERAS group had a shortened duration of pain ( 1-2 days; 53 % vs. 17 % , OR 0.64 , 95 % CI 0.29-1.37 , p = 0.0001). The urinary catheter was removed within 6 hours after surgery in 74 % patients in the ERAS group ( OR 400.1 , 95 % CI 23.56-6796 , p < 0.0001). The time to first oral liquid intake was a median of 8 hours in the ERAS group compared to 11 hours in the control group ( p < 0.0001) , and solid food intake occurred at a median of 24 hours in the ERAS group compared to 72 hours in the control group ( p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS This multidisciplinary , evidence-based , neurosurgical ERAS protocol for elective craniotomy appears to have significant benefits over conventional perioperative management. Implementation of ERAS is associated with a significant reduction in the postoperative hospital stay and an acceleration in recovery , without increasing complication rates related to elective craniotomy. Further evaluation of this protocol in large multicenter studies is warranted. Clinical trial registration no.: ChiCTR-INR-16009662 ( chictr.org.cn).
