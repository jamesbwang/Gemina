 Among atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) , rivaroxaban with background antiplatelet therapy significantly reduced the first occurrence of bleeding compared to triple therapy with warfarin. This study hypothesized that total bleeding events , including those beyond the first event , would be reduced with rivaroxaban-based regimens. In the PIONEER AF-PCI trial , 2099 patients in the modified intention-to-treat population were randomized to three groups and followed for 12 months: ( 1) rivaroxaban 15 mg once daily plus a P2Y URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.
