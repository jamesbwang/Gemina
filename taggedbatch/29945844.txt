 The wave of resolution revolution in cryo-EM has touched , and made a significant impact on , the structural biology of GPCRs. High-resolution structures of several GPCR-G-protein complexes are now determined by cryo-EM and they illuminate fine structural details of this central macromolecular complex involved in cellular signaling.
