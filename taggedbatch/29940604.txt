 Systematic review and meta-analysis. Examine the functional outcomes and complications following laminectomy for thoracic myelopathy due to ossification of the ligamentum flavum ( OLF). OLF is a rare condition that can cause thoracic myelopathy. Laminectomy is a procedure that can be performed to decompress the spinal<disease> cord in patients with thoracic myelopathy due to OLF. Few studies have examined postoperative outcomes and complications following laminectomy for thoracic myelopathy secondary to OLF. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. Literature search yielded six studies that met our selection criteria. Study characteristics and baseline patient demographics were extracted from each study. Primary outcomes included pre- and postoperative Japanese Orthopedic Association ( JOA) scores and perioperative complications including dural tears , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) leaks , neurological deficits , surgical<disease> site<disease> infections<disease> , and other complications. We calculated pooled proportion estimates for JOA scores and complications using a random effects model. A total of 137 patients were included. The pooled pre- and postoperative JOA scores were 5.08 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 2.70-7.47; I = 98 %) and 8.29 ( 95 % CI , 7.73-8.85; I = 18 %) , respectively , with a mean improvement of +3.03 points ( 95 % CI , 1.08-4.98; I = 88 %). Pooled proportion estimates for dural tears , CSF leaks , infections , and early neurological deficits were 18.4 % ( 95 % CI , 12.6-26.1; I = 0 %) , 12.1 % ( 95 % CI , 6.6-21.2; I = 0 %) , 5.8 % ( 95 % CI , 2.1-15.4; I = 0 %) , and 5.7 % ( 95 % CI , 2.2-14.3; I = 0 %) , respectively. Thoracic myelopathy secondary to OLF can be treated with laminectomy. However , despite some improvement in JOA score , functional status remains poor postoperatively. Perioperative complications are common , with dural tears and CSF leaks occurring most frequently. OLF is an uncommon condition and more research is needed to better understand how we can improve the outcomes of laminectomy alone for the treatment of thoracic myelopathy due to OLF. 3.
