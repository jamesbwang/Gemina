 This study was done retrospectively to evaluate rates of thrombocytopenia<symptom> and their clinical impact during chemo-radiotherapy for glioblastomas and to elucidate associated clinical factors. Sixty-four patients who received temozolomide chemotherapy at our institution were included. Thirty-five patients received full dose chemo-radiotherapy as per the STUPP protocol ( Group A) and nine patients received abbreviated radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy ( Group B). Twenty patients received temozolomide alone with an intended twelve cycles of therapy for first relapse at least six months after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy ( Group C). In group A , twenty-seven of thirty-five ( 77 %) patients completed chemo-radiotherapy phase. 14 % had grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia<symptom> leading to discontinuation. Sixteen of twenty-seven ( 59 %) patients completed adjuvant chemotherapy. There were no grade 3-4 thrombocytopenias<symptom> but 4 % discontinued due to grade 2 thrombocytopenias<symptom>. In Group B , four out of nine ( 45 %) patients completed chemo-radiotherapy phase. 11 % had grade 3-4 thrombocytopenias<symptom> and discontinued treatment. Three out of four ( 75 %) patients completed adjuvant chemotherapy. Of these , 75 % had grade 3-4 thrombocytopenias<symptom> but none discontinued. Lastly , in Group C , eight out of twenty ( 40 %) patients completed with 10 % discontinuing due to thrombocytopenias<symptom> and the rest due to disease progression. In exploratory analyses , being female increased the risk of myelosuppresion and there was a trend noticed in patients having a higher body surface area. Our toxicity data was within range of the literature. We identified the group of patients that have increased thrombocytopenia<symptom> risk. Larger pooled retrospective series and prospective studies are required. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
