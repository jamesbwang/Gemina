 This paper reports isolation of two monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs) that bind to both a membrane protein and a cytoplasmic protein. Most Abs established as markers for autoimmune disease bind to cytoplasmic or nuclear substances. However , it remains unknown how these Abs are produced. On the other hand , there were examples where clones originally isolated as Abs that bind to membrane proteins also showed binding activity to cytoplasmic or nuclear substances. Based on these results , the following hypothesis has been proposed. The Abs that had been originally produced against a membrane protein showed cross-reactivity against cytoplasmic or nuclear substances. In the present study we reported isolation of Abs that bound to both a membrane protein , CADM1 , and a cytoplasmic protein , α-actinin-4. The method adopted in the present study could be generally applicable to isolation of Abs showing such dual specificity. Firstly , we constructed a huge human Ab library using various organs including naïve B-cell-rich organs such as bone<disease> marrow and umbilical cords<disease>. Then , we developed a comprehensive screening method for isolation of Abs that bound to cell surface antigens. Through extensive screenings with many kinds of cell we newly obtained a library composed of around 4000 independent clones that bind to membrane proteins. We screened this library with α-actinin-4 and succeeded in isolating two Abs. They bound to α-actinin-4 and a membrane protein CADM1. Furthermore , they are encoded by naïve heavy and light chain variable genes ( V
