 Any sensory stimulus evokes a propagating wave of activity in the corresponding sensory cortex that exceeds its topographical boundaries within the primary sensory map. Hama and colleagues provided a first study , in the tactile modality , of the interactions between two successively evoked waves. We argue that the difficulty in finding a simple rule to account for all the various observed interactions calls for an effort to clarify the mechanisms and substrates of the propagating waves , and their role in sensory processing.
