 Hyperkalemia in neonatal diarrheic calves can potentially result in serious cardiac conduction abnormalities and arrhythmias. To document electrocardiographic ( ECG) findings and the sequence of ECG changes that are associated with increasing plasma potassium concentrations ( cK One hundred and thirty neonatal diarrheic calves ( age â‰¤ 21 days). Prospective observational study involving calves admitted to a veterinary teaching hospital. Hyperkalemic calves ( cK Hyperkalemia in neonatal diarrheic calves is associated with serious cardiac conduction abnormalities. In addition to increased S and T wave amplitude voltages , alterations of P and Ta wave amplitudes are early signs of hyperkalemia , which is consistent with the known sensitivity of atrial myocytes to increased cK
