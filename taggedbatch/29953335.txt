 This cross-sectional study describes the prevalence and context of violence by sexual partners against female sex workers ( FSWs , N = 589) in Andhra Pradesh and its association with alcohol use by FSWs and abusive partners. In all , 84 % of FSWs reported alcohol use; 65 % reported lifetime physical abuse by a sexual partner. Most abused women suffered abuse from multiple partners , often triggered by inebriation or FSW 's defiance. In multivariate logistic regressions , frequency of FSW 's alcohol use was associated with abuse by clients and primary partner , whereas partner 's alcohol use was only significant for abuse by primary partner , not clients.
