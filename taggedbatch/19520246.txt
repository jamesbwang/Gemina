 As cancer survivor rates improve with early screening and modern treatment options , cardiotoxicity is becoming an increasing problem. It is imperative for physicians to recognize adverse events early so that appropriate measures can be taken before advanced and permanent cardiac dysfunction ensues. In this review , we will evaluate the literature surrounding current cardiac biomarkers in the detection of cardiotoxicity during cancer treatment as well as discuss the role of emerging novel biomarkers. Troponin and brain natriuretic peptides show promise in the detection of subclinical cardiotoxicity during cancer treatment. In addition to identifying late complications among cancer survivors , they have the potential to predict patients who are at risk of developing cardiotoxicity prior to the initiation of cancer therapy. However , there are also conflicting data due to varying study design. Although biomarkers are an attractive option in the detection of cardiotoxicity among cancer patients , current recommendations surrounding its role are based on expert consensus opinion. Further research with appropriately designed prospective trials is required to guide optimal clinical practice.
