 To investigate the current situation of the activities of daily living ( ADL) of the aged at home in western China , and to analyze its influencing factors so that we can improve the quality of life and pension services of elderly people. The elderly people who came from Qinghai Province , Ningxia Autonomous Region , Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region , Shanxi Province , Guizhou Province , Guangxi Province , Sichuan Province , Yunnan Province and Chongqing were surveyed by questionnaires. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors of ADL. A total of 7 175 aged people living in the western China were surveyed. In the study , 78.86 % of the aged at home could independently live. 12.32 % of the aged were of mild dysfunction. 6.27 % of the aged had moderate<symptom> dysfunction<symptom>. And 2.55 % of the aged suffered severe dysfunction. Multiple Logistic analyses indicated that age , educational level , economic income , body mass index and disease were the factors that affected their ADL. The risk of decreased ADL in the 60-69 and 70-79 year-old groups were 0.221 ( 95 % CI: 0.190-0.258) and 0.353 ( 95 % CI: 0.305-0.409) times that of the elderly over the age of 80. Compared with illiterate seniors , the risks of decline in ADL of primary school , junior high school , secondary or high school , college or undergraduates , postgraduates or above were 0.299 ( 95 % CI: 0.140-0.637) , 0.312 ( 95 % CI: 0.146-0.663) , 0.238 ( 95 % CI: 0.112-0.510) , 0.226 ( 95 % CI: 0.105-0.484) , and 0.238 ( 95 % CI: 0.110-0.514) times. The declines in the risk of ADL for elderly people with quite difficult economic conditions , slight difficulty and breaking even were 2.720 ( 95 % CI: 2.015-3.672) , 2.344 ( 95 % CI: 1.816-3.027) , and 1.542 ( 95 % CI: 1.215-1.957) times of the economically abundant people. Compared with those with a body mass index ( BMI) â‰¥ 28 , the risk of ADL reduction for BMI < 18.5 was 1.577 ( 95 % CI: 1.142-2.179) times. And the ADL of the elderly with no disease was at the risk of falling 0.685 ( 95 % CI: 0.602-0.779) times that of an elderly person with the disease. The activities of daily living of age at home of western China are not high , and affected by many factors , such as age , educational level and so on. With the increasing of the elderly , maintaining and improving the ADL are the problems and challenges that we are faced with.
