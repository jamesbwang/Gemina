 The human body 's immune response to bacterial challenge , even when successful in controlling the infection , can result in negative consequences for the host , including reduced functionality of associated tissues. We present and analyze a low-dimensional mathematical model of this immune response to pathogen invasion , incorporating the coordinated actions of active immune cells , and both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The model simulates both the positive ( pathogen reduction) and negative ( local tissue dysfunction) effects of the immune response and includes the important role of immunologic memory in the process of a return to stasis. This differential equation-based model is sufficiently general to be applicable to a wide range of human tissues and organs.
