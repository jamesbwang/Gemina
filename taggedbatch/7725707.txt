 The purpose of this work is to develop a new model estimate of the fatigue<symptom> life of a hip prosthesis due to aseptic loosening as a multifactorial phenomenon. The formula developed here is a three-parameter model based on Basquin 's law for fatigue<symptom> , eccentric compression formula for the compressive stress and torsion in the prosthesis due to the horizontal components of the contact force. With our model , we can accurately predict the durability of a hip prosthesis due to the following four parameters: body<symptom> weight , femoral offset , duration , and intensity of daily physical activities of a patient. The agreement of the prediction with the real life of the prosthesis , observed on 15 patients , is found to be adequate. Based on the formula derived for a particular implant , there was a high degree of concurrence between the model-predicted and actual values of aseptic loosening ( durability) proved by the Mann-Whitney
