 Cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) is characterized by a chronic pulmonary<symptom> inflammation<symptom>. In CF , glucocorticoids ( GC) are widely used , but their efficacy and benefit/risk ratio are still debated. In plasma , corticosteroid-binding globulin ( CBG) binds 90 % of GC and delivers them to the inflammatory site. The main goal of this work was to study CBG expression in CF patients in order to determine whether CBG could be used to optimize GC treatment. The expression of CBG was measured in liver samples from CF cirrhotic and non-CF cirrhotic patients by qPCR and Western blot and in lung samples from non-CF and CF patients by qPCR.
