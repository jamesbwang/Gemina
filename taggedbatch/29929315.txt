 The aim of the present work was to test the efficiency of the phytoextraction process involving the use of exogenous phytohormone ( cytokinins , CKs) and fertilizer ( nitrogen , N) treatments in phytotechnologies to address risk management in `` recalcitrant areas ''. The CKs and N treatments , alone or combined ( CKs + N) in a Modulated Application ( MA) , were tested on the crop plant Helianthus annuus , common to Mediterranean area , fast growing and with high biomass production. Plants were grown on boron ( B) contaminated sediments ( collected from a geothermal area located in Tuscany ( Italy). Plant growth , B uptake , together with plant stress parameters were investigated. Boron is easily taken up and translocated by some crop plants , but the high phytotoxicity can dramatically impact the plant growth and consequently the applicability and efficiency of the phytoextraction process. As indicators of plant stress , oxidative balance<symptom> and photosynthetic parameters were investigated to give a deeper insight of phytotoxic mechanisms. Results showed that while each treatment ( CKs and N alone) had significantly positive effects on plant health , the MA treatment provided a synergistic effect on morphological parameters and biomass production as a whole. After MA treatment , plants showed antioxidant activity comparable to that of the control ( unpolluted sediments) and showed an increase of net photosynthesis. Moreover , our data showed very high values of B uptake and translocation ( about 800 mg kg
