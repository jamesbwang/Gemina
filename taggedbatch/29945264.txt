 Among all malignancies in Ukraine in 2016 , the group of non-melanoma skin cancers headed the list in men and made up 21.6 %. This group was second in women and made up 17.6 %. The diagnostics of skin tumors are becoming increasingly relevant. The store-and-forward ( SAF) method was used. The study included patients that were remotely diagnosed with melanocytic nevi , seborrheic keratoses , skin cancer , and skin melanoma. Patients signed up for remote diagnostics , were examined in person by dermatologists , and had tumors excised with a subsequent histological examination. Using telemedicine , 108 melanocytic nevi , 97 seborrheic keratoses , 62 skin cancers , and 47 skin melanomas were diagnosed and selected. The accuracy of teledermatological examination and teledermoscopy compared to clinical examination and dermoscopy was 90.3 to 100.0 %. The accuracy of teledermatological examination and teledermoscopy compared to histopathological diagnoses was 85.1 to 98.9 %. Teledermatological diagnosis showed a high ability for detecting skin neoplasms in Ukraine.
