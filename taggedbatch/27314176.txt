 Partner notification is an important component of public health test and treat interventions. To enhance this essential function , we assessed the potential for molecular methods to supplement routine partner notification and corroborate HIV<pathogen> networks. All persons diagnosed with HIV<pathogen> infection in Wake County , NC , during 2012-2013 and their disclosed sexual partners were included in a sexual network. A data set containing HIV-1 pol sequences collected in NC during 1997-2014 from 15,246 persons was matched to HIV-positive persons in the network and used to identify putative transmission clusters. Both networks were compared. The partner notification network comprised 280 index cases and 383 sexual partners and high-risk social contacts ( n = 131 HIV-positive). Of the 411 HIV-positive persons in the partner notification network , 181 ( 44 %) did not match to a HIV<pathogen> sequence , 61 ( 15 %) had sequences but were not identified in a transmission cluster , and 169 ( 41 %) were identified in a transmission cluster. More than half ( 59 %) of transmission clusters bridged sexual network partnerships that were not recognized in the partner notification; most of these clusters were dominated by men who have sex with men. Partner notification and HIV<pathogen> sequence analysis provide complementary representations of the existent partnerships underlying the HIV<pathogen> transmission network. The partner notification network components were bridged by transmission clusters , particularly among components dominated by men who have sex with men. Supplementing the partner notification network with phylogenetic data highlighted avenues for intervention.
