 For the past two decades , we have advanced in our understanding of the mechanisms implicated in the formation of brain circuits. The connection between the cortex and thalamus has deserved much attention , as thalamocortical connectivity is crucial for sensory processing and motor learning. Classical dye tracing studies in wild-type and knockout mice initially helped to characterize the developmental progression of this connectivity and revealed key transcription factors involved. With the recent advances in technical tools to specifically label subsets of projecting neurons , knock-down genes individually and/or modify their activity , the field has gained further understanding on the rules operating in thalamocortical circuit formation and plasticity. In this review , I will summarize the most relevant discoveries that have been made in this field , from development to early plasticity processes covering three major aspects: axon guidance , thalamic influence on sensory cortical specification , and the role of spontaneous thalamic activity. I will emphasize how the implementation of new tools has helped the field to progress and what I consider to be open questions and the perspective for the future.
