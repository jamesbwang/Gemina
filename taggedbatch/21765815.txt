 The chromosome 1q21 .1 duplication syndrome<disease><symptom> ( OMIM # 612475) is characterized by head anomalies , mild facial dysmorphisms , and cognitive problems , including autistic features , mental retardation , developmental delay , and learning disabilities. Speech and language development are sometimes impaired , but no detailed characterization of language problems in this condition has been provided to date. We report in detail on the cognitive and language phenotype of a child who presents with a duplication in 1q21 .1 ( arr ( hg19) 1q21 .1 q21 .2 ( 145,764,455-147,824,207) Ã— 3) , and who exhibits cognitive delay and behavioral disturbances. Language is significantly perturbed , being the expressive domain the most impaired area ( with significant dysphemic features in absence of pure motor<symptom> speech<symptom> deficits) , although language comprehension and use ( pragmatics) are also affected. Among the genes found duplicated in the child ,
