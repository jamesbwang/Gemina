 A discrete choice experiment ( DCE) is a method used to elicit participants ' preferences and the relative importance of different attributes and levels within a decision-making process. DCEs have become popular in healthcare; however , approaches to identify the attributes/levels influencing a decision of interest and to selection methods for their inclusion in a DCE are under-reported. Our objectives were: to explore the development process used to select/present attributes/levels from the identified range that may be influential; to describe a systematic and rigorous development process for design of a DCE in the context of thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke; and , to discuss the advantages of our five-stage approach to enhance current guidance for developing DCEs. A five-stage DCE development process was undertaken. Methods employed included literature review , qualitative analysis of interview and ethnographic data , expert panel discussions , a quantitative structured prioritisation ( ranking) exercise and pilot testing of the DCE using a ` think aloud ' approach. The five-stage process reported helped to reduce the list of 22 initial patient-related factors to a final set of nine variable factors and six fixed factors for inclusion in a testable DCE using a vignette model of presentation. In order for the data and conclusions generated by DCEs to be deemed valid , it is crucial that the methods of design and development are documented and reported. This paper has detailed a rigorous and systematic approach to DCE development which may be useful to researchers seeking to establish methods for reducing and prioritising attributes for inclusion in future DCEs.
