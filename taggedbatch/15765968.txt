 This study investigated the effect of dietary solvents on flexural strength and modulus of bulk-fill composites. One conventional composite ( Filtek Z350 ( FZ)) , two bulk-fill composites ( Filtek Bulk-fill ( FB) and Tetric N Ceram ( TN)) and a bulk-fill giomer ( Beautifil-Bulk Restorative ( BB)) were evaluated. Specimens ( 12 × 2 × 2 mm) were fabricated using customized stainless steel molds. Specimens were light-cured , removed from their molds , finished , measured and randomly divided into six groups. The groups ( n = 10) were conditioned in the following mediums for 7 days at 37 °C: air ( control) , artificial saliva ( SAGF) , distilled water , 0.02 N citric acid , heptane , 50 % ethanol-water solution. After conditioning , the specimens were rinsed , blotted dry , measured and subjected to flexural testing using a universal testing machine. Representative SEM images of the intact surfaces were obtained to appraise the degradation mechanism by dietary solvents. Data was subjected to statistical analysis using ANOVA/Tukey 's tests at significance level p < 0.05. Significant differences in flexural properties were observed between materials and conditioning mediums. The highest flexural properties were usually obtained with conditioning in air ( control) or heptane. Exposure to aqueous solutions generally reduced flexural properties of bulk-fill composites. The effect of dietary solvents on flexural properties of bulk-fill composites was material and medium dependent.
