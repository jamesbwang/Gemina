 To further illustrate the mutation traits of 21 autosomal STR loci involved in the newly developed AGCU 21 + 1 kit , randomly selected 485 trios were focused on. We have previously confirmed the biological father-mother-child relationships of these trios. Then matters of mutation rates , steps , and origins of the 21 STR loci were statically analyzed. Results showed 35 mutation events occurred at 16 STR loci of the panel during 20,370 meiosis , and the locus-specific mutation rates ranged from 0.000 to 1.134 % ( D3S4529) , with an overall mutation rate of 1.72 Ã— 10
