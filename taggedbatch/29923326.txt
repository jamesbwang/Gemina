 A new fluorine-containing azadibenzocyclooctyne ( ADIBO-F) was designed using a synthetically accessible pathway. The fluorine-18 prosthetic group was prepared from its toluenesulfonate precursor and isolated in 21-35 % radiochemical yield in 30 minutes of synthetic time. ADIBO-F has been incorporated into azide-functionalized , cancer-targeting peptides through a strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition with high radiochemical yields and purities. The final products are novel peptide-based positron emission tomography ( PET) imaging agents that possess high affinities for their targets , growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a ( GHSR-1a) and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor ( GRPR) , with IC
