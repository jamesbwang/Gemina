 Patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) have higher incidence of developing nephrolithiasis. Increased uric acid production induced by Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> exacerbates colitis<disease> in mice. We aimed to evaluate the association between serum uric acid level and disease activity in IBD population. Four hundred and thirty-five patients enrolled in Jinling Hospital from January 1 , 2015 to August 31 , 2017 were included in the retrospective study. Clinical parameters were collected and compared with non-IBD matched controls ( n = 51). Serum uric acid to creatinine ratio ( UA/Cr) was used as a biomarker for uric acid metabolism. Sixty-five active IBD patients were longitudinally studied to investigate the UA/Cr before and after therapy. Linear mixed models were estimated for Crohn 's disease ( CD) group to explore the relationship between UA/Cr and other parameters. Uric acid to creatinine ratio was significantly correlated with Crohn 's disease activity index ( ρ = 0.184 , P = 0.002) and Harvey Bradshaw index ( ρ = 0.154 , P = 0.010) and C-reactive protein ( ρ = 0.591 , P < 0.001) in CD group. Colonic CD and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae<pathogen> antibody ( ASCA) positive CD had an increased UA/Cr compared with L1 , L3 , and ASCA negative CD ( P = 0.027 , P = 0.0013 , and P = 0.043 , respectively). A significant decrease in UA/Cr was observed after induction therapy in active CD ( P = 0.0002) but not in ulcerative colitis<disease> ( P = 0.076). Uric acid to creatinine ratio correlated with disease activity in CD. Colonic CD and ASCA positive CD had an increased UA/Cr. Effective treatment for CD patients lowered UA/Cr. Uric acid metabolism might be a novel aspect to investigate disease activity of IBD.
