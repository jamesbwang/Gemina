 To examine and compare the clinical characteristics and treatment of youth with type 2 diabetes ( T2D) in two registries: one in Europe and one in the United States. Youth with onset of T2D at 10 to 18 years of age with current age < 20 years and an office visit after diabetes duration > 1 year were identified in the European ( Prospective Diabetes Follow-up , DPV) and the United States ( Pediatric Diabetes Consortium , PDC) databases. Demographic , physical and clinical characteristics and treatment at diagnosis as well as physical characteristics , treatment , laboratory data , and diabetes adverse events at most recent visit were analyzed from both registries. At diagnosis , the majority were female and obese; 70 % of DPV vs 34 % of PDC youth were diagnosed by targeted diabetes testing. PDC youth were younger , 12 vs 13 years ( P < 0.001) , had a greater body mass index-SDS , 3.07 vs 2.74 ( P < 0.001) , a higher hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c) , 9.9 % vs 7.1 % ( P < 0.001) , were more likely to present in DKA , 7.5 % vs 1.3 % ( P < 0.001) and more likely to be treated with insulin , 62 % vs 32 % ( P < 0.001); insulin treatment difference was not significant when adjusted for HbA1c. At follow-up , DPV youth had shorter diabetes duration , 2.1 vs 3.2 years ( P < 0.001) , lower HbA1c , 6.5 % vs 7.8 % ( P < 0.001) , were less likely to be treated with insulin , 36 % vs 56 % , ( P < 0.001) , and were more likely to have dyslipidemia and hypertension than PDC youth. PDC youth had a higher rate of microalbuminuria. Both DPV and PDC youth have multiple risks for diabetes complications. Understanding reasons for persistently higher HbA1c in PDC youth requires further study.
