 Necrotising soft<disease> tissue<disease> infection<disease> , or necrotising fasciitis<disease> , is a rapidly progressing disease requiring immediate diagnosis and treatment consisting of antimicrobial therapy , hyperbaric oxygen , debridement surgery and treatment in the intensive care unit. The harrowing illness trajectory affects the family caregivers potentially producing long-term psychological issues. We aimed to explore the experiences and coping strategies of family caregivers during the first six months after patient diagnosis of necrotising soft<disease> tissue<disease> infection<disease>. Our study had a prospective , explorative , qualitative design using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis to understand necrotising soft<disease> tissue<disease> infection<disease> as an intrinsic and instrumental case. Family caregivers ( n = 25) were recruited at three university hospitals in Denmark and Sweden. We identified three chronological themes describing issues of importance to the family caregivers. In the intensive care unit: Coping with illness and intensive care; In the ward: Coping with injury and post-intensive care and At home: Coping with recovery and new home life. Challenges facing family caregivers of necrotising soft<disease> tissue<disease> infections<disease> survivors are still under-recognised. Healthcare professionals need to ensure that families and stakeholders throughout the patient trajectory have access to and co-create timely information and care plans to bridge the knowledge gap across care environments and to relieve family responsibility.
