 Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease caused by immune disorder. The chronic skin<symptom> inflammation<symptom> involves inflammatory molecules that are released from T lymphocytes and keratinocytes. Therefore , developing an anti-inflammatory therapy that is suitable for long-term treatment is needed. Electrical stimulation induces biological responses by modulating intracellular signaling pathways. Our previous studies showed that the optimized combination treatment of mild electrical stimulation ( MES , 0.1-millisecond; ms , 55-pulses per second; pps) and heat shock<symptom> ( HS , 42 °C) modulates inflammatory symptoms of metabolic disorders and chronic kidney disease in mice models and clinical trials. Here , we investigated the effect of MES+HS treatment on imiquimod-induced psoriasis mouse model. Topical application of imiquimod cream ( 15 mg) to mice ear induced keratinocyte hyperproliferation and psoriasis-like inflammation<symptom>. In MES+HS- treated mice , imiquimod-induced skin hyperplasia<disease> was significantly decreased. MES+HS treatment reduced the protein expression of IL-17A and the infiltration of CD3-positive cells in lesioned skin. In addition , MES+HS- treated mice had decreased mRNA expression level of antimicrobial molecules ( S100A8 and Reg3γ) which aggravate psoriasis. In IL-17A-stimulated HaCaT cells , MES+HS treatment significantly lowered the mRNA expression of aggravation markers ( S100A8 , S100A9 and β-defensin2). Taken together , our study suggested that MES+HS treatment improves the pathology of psoriasis via decreasing the expression of inflammatory molecules.
