 Bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs) are multipotential differentiation cells which can differentiate into different cell types such as osteoblasts , chondrocytes , adipocytes , cardiomyocytes , hepatocytes , endothelial cells , and neuronal cells. Such multipotential differentiation makes them attractive for stem cell-based therapy aimed at treating previously incurable disorders. In the present work , we encapsulated BMSCs into a hydrogel with a three-dimensional ( 3D) network of nanofibers , formed from self-assembling of peptide amphiphile. The self-assembling of peptide amphiphile into hydrogel was triggered by mixing cell suspensions with dilute aqueous solutions of amphipathic peptide. Moreover , this hydrogel was designed to present cells the neurite-promoting laminin epitope IKVAV at nearly van der Waals density , which induced the successful differentiation of BMSCs into neural cells.
