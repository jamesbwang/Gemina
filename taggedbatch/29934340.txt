 In 2017 , an estimated 17,000 individuals were diagnosed with esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC) and less than 20 % will survive 5 years. PET-avidity is indicative of high glucose utilization and is nearly universal in EAC. TXNIP blocks glucose uptake and exhibits pro-apoptotic functions. Higher expression in EAC has been associated with improved disease-specific survival , lack of lymph node involvement , reduced perineural invasion , and increased tumor differentiation. We hypothesized that TXNIP may act as a tumor suppressor that sensitizes EAC cells to standard chemotherapeutics. EAC cell lines and a Barrett 's epithelial cell line were used. qRT-PCR , immunoblot , and immunofluorescence techniques evaluated gene expression. TXNIP was stably over-expressed or knocked down using lentiviral RNA transduction techniques. Murine xenograft methods examined growth following over-expression of TXNIP. Apoptosis and DNA damage were measured by Annexin V and É£H2AX assays. Activation of the intrinsic apoptosis was quantitated with green fluorescence protein-caspase 3 reporter assay. In cultured cells and an esophageal tissue array , TXNIP expression was higher in Barrett 's epithelia and normal tissue compared to EAC. Constitutive over-expression of TXNIP decreased proliferation , clonogenicity , and tumor xenograft growth. TXNIP overexpression increased whereas knockdown abrogated DNA damage and apoptosis following cisplatin treatment. An HDAC-inhibitor , entinostat ( currently in clinical trials) , upregulated TXNIP and synergistically increased cisplatin-mediated DNA damage and apoptosis. TXNIP is a tumor suppressor that is down-regulated in EACC. Its re-expression dramatically sensitizes these cells to cisplatin. Our findings support phase I/II evaluation of ` priming ' strategies to enhance the efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutics in EAC.
