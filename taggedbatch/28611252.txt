 Herpesviruses include many important human pathogens such as herpes<disease> simplex<pathogen><disease> virus , cytomegalovirus , varicella-zoster virus , and the oncogenic Epstein-Barr<disease> virus and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus<pathogen>. Herpes<disease> virions contain a large icosahedral capsid that has a portal at a unique 5-fold vertex , similar to that seen in the tailed bacteriophages. The portal is a molecular motor through which the viral genome enters the capsid during virion morphogenesis. The genome also exits the capsid through the portal-vertex when it is injected through the nuclear pore into the nucleus of a new host cell to initiate infection. Structural investigations of the herpesvirus<pathogen> portal-vertex have proven challenging , owing to the small size of the tail-like portal-vertex-associated tegument ( PVAT) and the presence of the tegument layer that lays between the nucleocapsid and the viral envelope , obscuring the view of the portal-vertex. Here , we show the structure of the herpes<disease> simplex<pathogen><disease> virus portal-vertex at subnanometer resolution , solved by electron cryomicroscopy ( cryoEM) and single-particle 3D reconstruction. This led to a number of new discoveries , including the presence of two previously unknown portal-associated structures that occupy the sites normally taken by the penton and the Ta triplex<pathogen>. Our data revealed that the PVAT is composed of 10 copies of the C-terminal domain of pUL25 , which are uniquely arranged as two tiers of star-shaped density. Our 3D reconstruction of the portal-vertex also shows that one end of the viral genome extends outside the portal in the manner described for some bacteriophages but not previously seen in any eukaryote viruses. Finally , we show that the viral genome is consistently packed in a highly ordered left-handed spool to form concentric shells of DNA. Our data provide new insights into the structure of a molecular machine critical to the biology of an important class of human pathogens.
