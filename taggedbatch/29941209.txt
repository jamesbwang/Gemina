 Delivering charged antibiotics to the intervertebral disc is challenging because of the avascular , negatively charged extracellular matrix ( ECM) of the tissue. The purpose of this study was to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient of two clinically relevant , charged antibiotics , vancomycin ( positively charged) and oxacillin ( negatively charged) in IVD. A one-dimensional steady state diffusion experiment was employed to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient of the two antibiotics in bovine coccygeal annulus fibrosus ( AF) tissue. The averaged apparent diffusion coefficient for vancomycin under 20 % compressive strain was 7.94 ± 2.00 × 10
