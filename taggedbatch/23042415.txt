 Electrochemically driven functioning of a battery inevitably induces thermal and mechanical effects , which in turn couple with the electrochemical effect and collectively govern the performance of the battery. However , such a coupling effect , whether favorable or detrimental , has never been explicitly elucidated. Here we use in situ transmission electron microscopy to demonstrate such a coupling effect. We discover that thermally perturbating delithiated LiNi
