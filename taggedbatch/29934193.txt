 The validation of a rapid , precise ( RSD < 4.6 %) , reliable and sensitive ( LOD = 0.026 Âµg/mL) liquid chromatography method for vitamin C quantification in foods ( infant formulae , n = 4; follow-on formulae , n = 3; processed cereal based-foods , n = 7; and baby foods , n = 10) for infants and young children is described. Vitamin C content ranged from 1.50 to 144 mg/100 g. A comparison between the declared values and the measured concentrations , as well as the accordance of these values with the tolerances , was performed. For 50 % of the analysed foods , the measured vitamin C content was higher than the declared value. However , all the analysed foods were in compliance with EU legislation concerning the maximum limits of vitamin C added to foods. The results obtained will be very useful for analytical laboratory control , risk assessment , establishment of maximum limits , development and implementation of guidelines regarding nutrient recommendations and estimation of vitamin C intake among infants and young children.
