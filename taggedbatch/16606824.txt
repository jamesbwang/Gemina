 CD19 is overexpressed in most human<pathogen> B<pathogen> cell malignancies and considered an important tumor marker for diagnosis and treatment. Aptamers are oligonucleotides that may potentially serve as tumor-homing ligand for targeted cancer therapy with excellent affinity and specificity. In this study , we selected a novel CD19 aptamer ( LC1) that was a 59-nucleotide single strand DNA. The aptamer could bind to recombinant CD19 protein with a
