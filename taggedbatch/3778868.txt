 A solid-phase methodology to synthesize oligopeptides , specifically incorporating serine residues linked to ADP-ribose ( ADPr) , is presented. Through the synthesis of both α- and β-anomers of the phosphoribosylated Fmoc-Ser building block and their usage in our modified solid-phase peptide synthesis protocol , both α- and β-ADPr peptides from a naturally Ser-ADPr containing H2B sequence were obtained. With these , and by digestion studies using the human glycohydrolase , ARH3 ( hARH3) , compelling evidence is obtained that the α-Ser-ADPr linkage comprises the naturally occurring configuration.
