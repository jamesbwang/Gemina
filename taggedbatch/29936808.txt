 Muscle<symptom> fatigue<symptom> has been studied for a long time with the use of a wide variety of exercise models , protocols and assessment methods , among which surface electromyography ( sEMG) is most commonly used. The main sEMG parameters ( amplitude and frequency) are prevalently used to evaluate the level of muscle<symptom> fatigue<symptom> in static and dynamic contractions. The purpose of this study is to determine and compare 2 separate indices: IF <sub> 1 </sub> basis of the sEMG signal amplitude analysis and IF <sub> 2 </sub> basis of the sEMG median frequency analysis , related to muscles<symptom> fatigue<symptom> during an isometric contraction. The study was performed on 60 professional runners divided into 2 equal groups. The first group comprised sprinters , competing in short distance track and field events ( 100 and 200 meters). The second group consisted of middle-distance runners , competing in middle-distance track and field events ( 800 and 1,500 meters). The electrical activity of the VMO muscles of the right and left lower limbs was recorded simultaneously during isometric activity in a squatting position. The sEMG data was used to determine and compare IF <sub> 1 </sub> and IF <sub> 2 </sub> indices. During isometric measurement , sprinters presented a much more significant increase in the mean amplitude of sEMG signal in comparison to middle-distance runners ( mean IF <sub> 1 </sub> difference: 0.228; p = 0.007). Analysis of the median frequency did not show significant differences between the 2 groups ( mean IF <sub> 2 </sub> difference: 0.037; p = 0.12). Change in sEMG amplitude during isometric exercise may be related to muscles<symptom> fatigue<symptom>. The use of fatigue<symptom> indices , based on sEMG amplitude , as an objective indicator of the efficacy of an endurance training programme for sportsmen requires further research.
