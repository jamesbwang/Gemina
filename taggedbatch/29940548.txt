 Paracoccidioidomycosis<disease> is endemic in subtropical rainforests of Latin America. Acute/subacute presentations involve an aggressive dissemination throughout the lymphatic system , while chronic forms ( more frequent) arise as differential diagnosis for other conditions involving lung , oropharynx , skin , and eventually the brain. We present the case of a man referred for evaluation and treatment of a possible lung tumor with brain metastasis. The finding of multibudded yeasts and the microbiological isolation of a dimorphic fungus identified as Paracoccidioides<pathogen> sp. from a brain biopsy prompted a cardinal change in prognosis and treatment. This case alerts on the importance of considering systemic<disease> fungal<disease> diseases<disease> as differential diagnosis of compatible clinical presentations in patients who had lived in , or visited , endemic areas.
