 Despite the rapid rise in diversity and quantities of engineered nanomaterials produced , the impacts of these emerging contaminants on the structure and function of ecosystems have received little attention from ecologists. Moreover , little is known about how manufactured nanomaterials may interact with nutrient pollution in altering ecosystem productivity , despite the recognition that eutrophication is the primary water quality issue in freshwater ecosystems worldwide. In this study , we asked two main questions: ( 1) To what extent do manufactured nanoparticles affect the biomass and productivity of primary producers in wetland ecosystems? ( 2) How are these impacts mediated by nutrient pollution? To address these questions , we examined the impacts of a citrate-coated gold nanoparticle ( AuNPs) and of a commercial pesticide containing Cu ( OH)
