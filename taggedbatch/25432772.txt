 The Triple Code Model ( TCM) of numerical cognition argues for the existence of three representational codes for number: Arabic digits , verbal number words , and analog nonsymbolic magnitude representations , each subserved by functionally dissociated neural substrates. Despite the popularity of the TCM , no study to date has explored all three numerical codes within one fMRI paradigm. We administered three tasks , associated with each of the aforementioned numerical codes , in order to explore the neural correlates of numerosity processing in a sample of adults ( N = 46). Independent task-control contrast analyses revealed task-dependent activity in partial support of the model , but also highlight the inherent complexity of a distributed and overlapping fronto-parietal network involved in all numerical codes. The results indicate that the TCM correctly predicts the existence of some functionally dissociated neural substrates , but requires an update that accounts for interactions with attentional processes. Parametric contrasts corresponding to differences in task difficulty revealed specific neural correlates of the distance effect , where closely spaced numbers become more difficult to discriminate than numbers spaced further apart. A conjunction analysis illustrated overlapping neural correlates across all tasks , in line with recent proposals for a fronto-parietal network of number processing. We additionally provide tentative results suggesting the involvement of format-independent numerosity-sensitive retinotopic maps in the early visual stream , extending previous findings of nonsymbolic stimulus selectivity. We discuss the functional roles of the components associated with the model , as well as the purported fronto-parietal network , and offer arguments in favor of revising the TCM.
