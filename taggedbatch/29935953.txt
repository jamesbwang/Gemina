 Important components that might mediate the relationship between aging and falls are reduced muscle strength and mass. Although muscle-related phenotypes have been linked to falls in older people , the role of muscle quality has yet to be examined. To investigate the relationship between muscle quality and incidence of falls over an 18-month follow-up in older community-dwelling women. A total of 167 women ( 68.1 Â± 6.2 years) underwent quadriceps isometric peak torque and thigh-muscle thickness assessments using isokinetic dynamometer and ultrasound , respectively. Muscle quality was considered as the ratio between maximal strength and muscle thickness. Participants were tracked by phone calls for ascertainment of falls during the follow-up period. Cox proportional regressions and X A total of 139 volunteers were successful tracked over the follow-up period. The overall incidence of fall was 23.4 % ( 95 % CI: 16.5-31.0). Rate of fallers among individuals with low-muscle quality ( 57.7 %) was higher than in those with normal muscle quality ( 15.3 %) ( X Low-muscle quality is associated with a higher incidence of falls in older women. These findings provide support for the concept that muscle quality is a clinically meaningful assessment among older people.
