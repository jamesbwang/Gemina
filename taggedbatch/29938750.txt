 An essential dimension of 3D regeneration in adult animals is developmental , with the formation of organizers from somatic tissues. These organizers produce signals that recruit surrounding cells and drive the restoration of the missing structures ( organs , appendages , body parts). However , even in animals with a high regenerative potential , this developmental potential is not sufficient to achieve regeneration as homeostatic conditions at the time of injury need to be `` pro-regenerative ''. In Hydra , we identified four distinct homeostatic properties that provide a pro-regenerative framework and we discuss here how these non-developmental properties impact regeneration. First , both the epithelial and the interstitial-derived cells are highly plastic along the animal body , a plasticity that offers several routes to achieve regeneration. Second , the abundant stocks of continuously self-renewing adult stem cells form a constitutive pro-blastema in the central body column , readily activated upon bisection. Third , the autophagy machinery in epithelial cells guarantees a high level of fitness and adaptation to detrimental environmental conditions , as evidenced by the loss of regeneration in animals where autophagy is dysfunctional. Fourth , the extracellular matrix , named mesoglea in Hydra , provides a dynamically-patterned environment where the molecular and mechanical signals induced by injury get translated into a regenerative process. We claim that these homeostatic pro-regenerative features contribute to define the high regenerative potential of adult Hydra.
