 Chlorothalonil is an important broad spectrum fungicide widely used in agriculture , silviculture , and urban settings. As a result of its massive use , chlorothalonil was found in all environmental matrices , with consequent risks to the health of terrestrial and aquatic organisms , as well as for humans. We analyzed the effects of chlorothalonil on human lymphocytes using in vitro chromosomal aberrations ( CAs) and micronuclei ( MNi) assays. Lymphocytes were exposed to five concentrations of chlorothalonil: 0.600 µg/mL , 0.060 µg/mL , 0.030 µg/mL , 0.020 µg/mL , and 0.015 µg/mL , where 0.020 and 0.600 µg/mL represent the ADI and the ARfD concentration values , respectively , established by FAO/WHO for this compound; 0.030 and 0.060 μg/mL represent intermediate values of these concentrations and 0.015 μg/mL represents the ADI value established by the Canadian health and welfare agency. We observed cytogenetic effects of chlorothalonil on cultured human lymphocytes in terms of increased CAs and MNi frequencies at all tested concentrations , including the FAO/WHO ADI and ARfD values of 0.020 and 0.600 μg/mL , respectively , but with exception of the Canadian ADI value of 0.015 μg/mL. Finally , no sexes differences were found in the levels of CAs and MNi induced by different chlorothalonil concentrations. Similarly , the mitotic index and the cytokinesis-block proliferation index did not show any significant effect on the proliferative capacity of the cells , although at the chlorothalonil concentration of 0.600 μg/mL the P-values of both indices were borderline.
