 Lean is emerging as a quality improvement ( QI) strategy in health care , but there has been minimal adoption in primary care teaching practices. This study describes a strategy for implementing Lean in an academic family medicine center and provides a formative assessment of this approach. A case study of the University of North Carolina Family Medicine Center that used the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to guide a formative evaluation. The implementation strategy included partnering with Lean content experts and creating a leadership team; planning and completing QI events and Lean training modules; and evaluating and reporting activities related to QI and training. During the initial period of Lean implementation , there was ( 1) minimal to no change in the quality of care as determined by the Preventive Care Index ( 46-48); ( 2) a decrease patient appointment cycle time from 89 minutes to 65 minutes; ( 3) an increase in overall practice productivity from $ 8144 to $ 9160; ( 4) a decrease in patient satisfaction from 94 % to 91 %; and ( 5) an increase in monthly visit volume from 4112 to 5076. Lean had an uneven effect on QI in an academic primary care practice during the first year of implementation.
