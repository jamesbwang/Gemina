 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO) can deliver effective respiratory and circulatory maintenance to organ donors , improve organ function , and shorten warm ischemic time before harvesting. However , ECMO-supported brain-dead donors ( DBDs) still have a high risk of acute kidney injury related to decreased renal oxygen delivery and inflammatory damage , which may cause early graft failure. Kidney transplantation from an ECMO-supported DBD. We found an extremely abnormal `` very dark blue '' appearance of the graft kidneys from an ECMO-supported DBD during kidney procurement. Rather than discarding the graft kidneys , we performed an on-table biopsy. Pretransplant biopsy results revealed minimal interstitial fibrosis<disease> in the section of these graft kidneys. Two candidates received graft kidneys , and the two grafts remained functional until the 8-month follow-up. Currently , there is no standard method for evaluating graft kidney function of ECMO-supported DBDs. Regardless of the donors ' preoperative serum creatinine ( SCr) level , estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) , or gross appearance of the graft kidney , we believe that it is more reliable to include pretransplant biopsy as a criterion in clinical practice to safely accept kidneys from ECMO-supported DBDs.
