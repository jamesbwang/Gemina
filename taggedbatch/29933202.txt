 Latent print examination traditionally follows the ACE-V process , in which latent prints are first analyzed to determine whether they are suitable for comparison , and then compared to an exemplar and evaluated for similarities and differences. Despite standard operating procedures and quality controls designed , in part , to mitigate differences between examiners , latent print processing and review are inherently subjective. The ACE-V process addresses subjectivity , and the possibility of error , in the verification stage in which a second examiner repeats the analysis , comparison , and evaluation steps in a given case. Other procedures outside the ACE-V framework , such as consultation and conflict resolution , provide further opportunity to understand how differences between latent print examiners emerge. Despite the growing body of research on latent print examination , questions have emerged about how these procedures work in practice. This study reviews case processing data for two years of casework at the Houston Forensic Science Center ( HFSC). We describe these data as cases proceed through each step of the ACE-V process , with a particular focus on verification , consultation , and conflict resolution. We discuss trends in these processes regarding modal types of disagreements , modal outcomes , and roles of the examiners involved. Results reveal implications for improving the practice of latent print examination.
