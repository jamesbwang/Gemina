 Limited data exist comparing the safety and efficacy of direct-acting antivirals ( DAAs) in hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) monoinfected and HCV/human immunodeficiency<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) coinfected patients in the real-world clinic practice setting. All HCV<pathogen> monoinfected and HCV/HIV coinfected patients treated with DAAs between January 2014 and October 2017 in community clinic settings were retrospectively analyzed. Pretreatment baseline patient characteristics , treatment efficacy , factors affecting sustained virologic response at 12 weeks ( SVR 12) after treatment , and adverse reactions were compared between the groups. A total of 327 patients were included in the study , of which 253 were HCV<pathogen> monoinfected , and 74 were HCV/HIV coinfected. There was a statistically significant difference observed in SVR 12 when comparing HCV<pathogen> monoinfection and HCV/HIV coinfection ( 94 % and 84 % , respectively , p = 0.005). However , there were no significant factors identified as a predictor of a reduced response. The most common adverse effect was fatigue<symptom> ( 27 %). No significant drug interaction was observed between DAA and antiretroviral therapy. None of the patients discontinued the treatment due to adverse events. In a real-world setting , DAA regimens have lower SVR 12 in HCV/HIV coinfection than in HCV<pathogen> monoinfection. Further studies involving a higher number of HCV/HIV coinfected patients are needed to identify real predictors of a reduced response.
