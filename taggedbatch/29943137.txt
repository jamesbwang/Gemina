 The number of patients aged ≥ 90 years is increasing worldwide; however , the treatment guidelines for colorectal cancer in elderly patients remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes of patients with primary colorectal cancer aged ≥ 90 years. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 100 patients ( aged ≥ 90 years) with primary colorectal adenocarcinoma. Their demographic and clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes were assessed. The patients who underwent tumor resections ( n = 71) showed longer overall and cancer-specific survival than those who underwent non-operative treatments ( n = 29) ( median overall survival time: 23.92 months vs. 2.99 months , P < 0.0001). Age , body mass index , performance status , advanced cancer stage ( stages 3 and 4) , and treatment strategy were identified as risk factors , prognostic factors , and predictors of overall survival. No significant differences in the postoperative morbidity rate , in-hospital mortality rate , and survival time were found between the elective laparoscopic ( n = 27) and elective open ( n = 37) surgery subgroups. However , the in-hospital mortality rate was 6.25 % ( 4/64) in the patients who underwent elective open surgeries and 42.9 % ( 3/7) in those who underwent emergent open surgeries ( p = 0.0179). In clinical practice , surgical treatment should not be denied to patients with primary colorectal cancer aged ≥ 90 years. However , the high complication and mortality rates for emergency surgeries act as a deterrent. Further studies to eliminate the bias between operative and non-operative groups may be needed to validate our results.
