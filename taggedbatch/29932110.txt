 Interleukin-1 & beta; ( IL-1 & beta ;-RRB- is a prominent pro-inflammatory cytokine that is implicated in a variety of autoimmune diseases and plays an important role in host defense against infections. IL-1 & beta; activity increases with its increasing binding capacity to IL-1 receptors ( IL-1Rs). Thus , numerous studies have targeted the discovery of molecules modulating the interactions between IL-1 & beta; and IL-1R1. We have conducted an IL-1R1 structure-based virtual screening to identify small molecules that could alter IL-1 & beta; activity , using in silico computational analysis. Sixty compounds from commercial libraries were predicted to bind to IL-1R1 , and their influence on cytokine production in IL-1 & beta;- stimulated gingival fibroblasts ( GFs) was determined. Of these , only ( 2- ( 1,2-diphenyl-1H-indol-3-yl) ethanamine ( DPIE) showed a synergistic increase in inflammatory molecules and cytokine production ( IL-6 , IL-8 , and COX-2) at both mRNA and protein levels in IL-1 & beta;- stimulated GFs. The enhancing activity of DPIE in IL-1 & beta;- induced cytokine production increased in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. This pattern was also observed in IL-1 & beta;- stimulated primary human periodontal ligament cells ( PDLs). Furthermore , we measured the impact of DPIE on the IL-1 & beta; ‚Åª IL-1R1 system using surface plasmon resonance and demonstrated that DPIE increased the binding affinity of IL-1 & beta; to IL-1R1. These data indicate that DPIE boosts IL-1 & beta; signaling by enhancing the binding of IL-1 & beta; to IL-1R1 in oral primary cells.
