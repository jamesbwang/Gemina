 The identification of root caries<disease> and calculus on tooth roots is of increasing importance with our aging population. Exposed root surfaces are often impacted by erosion , abrasion , calculus and staining which can make the identification and management of caries<disease> challenging. Identification of dental calculus on root surfaces and verification of its removal is also important for patient education and to decrease susceptibility to caries<disease> and periodontal<disease> disease<disease>. The objective of this study was to determine how the contrast of root caries<disease> lesions<symptom> and dental calculus varies with wavelength in the visible to near-infrared. The contrast of suspected root caries<disease> lesions<symptom> and dental calculus on 30 extracted teeth was measured using cross-polarization reflectance measurements at wavelengths from 400 to 2350 nm. Significantly higher ( P < 0.05) lesion<symptom> contrast was measured at wavelengths greater than 1460 nm. Stains interfered significantly at wavelengths less than 850 nm yielding non-diagnostic contrast for root caries<disease> lesions<symptom>. We postulate that the high absorption of water at longer wavelengths reduced the light scattering from the surrounding and underlying normal dentin , thus increasing the lesion<symptom> contrast. This study indicates that wavelengths beyond 1400 nm are advantageous for imaging calculus and caries<disease> lesions<symptom> on root surfaces due to the high contrast and lack of interference from stain.
