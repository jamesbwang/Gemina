 LIMKs ( LIMK1 and LIMK2) are serine/threonine protein kinases that involve in various cellular activities such as cell migration , morphogenesis and cytokinesis. However , its roles during mammalian early embryo development are still unclear. In the present study , we disrupted LIMK1/2 activity to explore the functions of LIMK1/2 during mouse early embryo development. We found that p-LIMK1/ 2 mainly located at the cortex of each blastomeres from 2-cell to 8-cell stage , and p-LIMK1/ 2 also expressed at morula and blastocyst stage in mouse embryos. Inhibition of LIMK1/2 activity by LIMKi 3 ( BMS-5) at the zygote stage caused the failure of embryo early cleavage , and the disruption of LIMK1/2 activity at 8-cell stage caused the defects of embryo compaction and blastocyst formation. Fluorescence staining and intensity analysis results demonstrated that the inhibition of LIMK1/2 activity caused aberrant cortex actin expression and the decrease of phosphorylated cofilin in mouse embryos. Taken together , we identified LIMK1/2 as an important regulator for cofilin phosphorylation and actin assembly during mouse early embryo development.
