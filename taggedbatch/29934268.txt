 This nationwide population-based study aimed to examine the prospective association between near visual activities and incident myopia in Taiwanese children 7 to 12 years old over a 4-year follow-up period. Prospective cohort design. There were 1958 children aged 7 to 12 years from the Taiwan 2009 National Health Interview Survey who were linked to the 2009 through 2013 claims data from the National Health Insurance system. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the associations between 3 types of near visual activities in sedentary posture<symptom> , namely reading ( < 0.5 , 0.5-0.9 , ≥ 1.0 hours per day ( h/d)) , use of computer , Internet , and games ( < 0.5 , 0.5-0.9 , ≥ 1.0 h/d) , and `` cram school '' attendance ( < 0.5 , 0.5-1.9 , ≥ 2.0 h/d) , and incident myopia. Prevalent myopia was defined as those who had ≥ 2 ambulatory care claims ( International Classification of Diseases code 367.1) in 2008-2009. Incident myopia was defined by those who had at least 2 ambulatory care claims ( International Classification of Diseases code 367.1) during the 4-year follow-up period ( 2010-2013) after excluding prevalent cases. Overall , 26.8 % of children had myopia at baseline , and 27.7 % of those without myopia at baseline developed incident myopia between 2010 and 2013. On average , they spent 0.68 ± 0.86 h/d on computer/Internet use , 0.63 ± 0.67 h/d on reading , and 2.78 ± 3.53 h/d on cram<disease> school. The results showed that children attending cram<disease> schools ≥ 2 h/d ( hazard ratio , 1.31; 95 % confidence interval , 1.03-1.68) had a higher risk of incident myopia. The effects of these activities remained similar in sensitivity analyses. Cram school attendance for ≥ 2 h/d may increase the risk of children 's incident myopia. This effect may be due to increased near visual activity or reduced time outdoors.
