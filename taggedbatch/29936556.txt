 Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI) can include the transition from a normal state to dementia. To explore biomarkers for the development of dementia , we performed an 18-month follow-up study in 28 patients with amnestic MCI. Amyloid deposition was examined using PiB PET , and cerebral blood flow ( CBF) was examined using SPECT. Cognitive function was periodically assessed. The rate of conversion to dementia was higher in the PiB-positive/equivocal group ( 74 %) than in the PiB-negative group ( 33 %) ( p = 0.041). Perfusion SPECT was performed in 16 patients. MCI patients with an AD-characteristic pattern of reduced CBF had a higher PiB-positive/equivocal rate ( 82 %) than those with a non-AD pattern ( 20 %) ( p = 0.018) , and patients with an AD pattern had a higher conversion rate ( 82 %) than those with a non-AD pattern ( 40 %) ( p = 0.094). Clinically , all PiB-positive converters were diagnosed as having Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) , whereas PiB-negative converters were thought to have some form of dementia other than AD. Amyloid PET is useful for predicting conversion to AD in MCI patients. A pattern analysis of perfusion SPECT findings might also be helpful for predicting conversion to AD , but with a lower specificity.
