 There is increasing evidence that changes in epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression are involved in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. Such evidence stems from studies conducted on postmortem brain tissues and peripheral cells or tissues of patients with mood disorders. This article describes and discusses the epigenetic changes in the mood disorders ( major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder) found to date. The article also describes and discusses preclinical drug trials of epigenetic drugs for treating mood disorders. In addition , nonrandomized and randomized controlled trials of nutritional drugs with effects on epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression in patients with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder are discussed. Trials of epigenetic drugs and nutritional drugs with epigenetic effects are showing promising results for the treatment of mood disorders. Thus , epigenetic drugs and nutritional drugs with epigenetic effects could be useful in the treatment of patients with these disorders.
