 In the present study , locally isolated Rhodococcus<pathogen> strains were attempted as biological tools for methyl red removal , a mutagenic azo dye posing threat to the environment if left untreated. Rhodococcus<pathogen> strain UCC 0016 demonstrated superior methyl red-decolourizing activity of 100 % after 24 h at static condition in comparison to Rhodococcus<pathogen> strain UCC 0008 which recorded 65 % decolourization after 72 h. Optimization of physicochemical parameters at 30 Â°C , pH 7 and supplementing glucose as the carbon source resulted in improved methyl red-decolourizing activity at static condition and reduced the time taken to achieve complete decolourization by 80 %. Higher concentration of methyl red ( 5 g/L) was able to be decolourized completely within 10 h by adopting the technology of immobilization. The encapsulated cells of Rhodococcus<pathogen> strain UCC 0016 demonstrated higher substrate affinity ( K
