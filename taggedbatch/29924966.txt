 The advent of precision medicine for genetic diseases has been hampered by the large number of variants that cause familial and somatic disease , a complexity that is further confounded by the impact of genetic modifiers. To begin to understand differences in onset , progression and therapeutic response that exist among disease-causing variants , we present the proteomic variant approach ( ProVarA) , a proteomic method that integrates mass spectrometry with genomic tools to dissect the etiology of disease. To illustrate its value , we examined the impact of variation in cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) , where 2025 disease-associated mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR) gene have been annotated and where individual genotypes exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity and response to therapeutic intervention. A comparative analysis of variant-specific proteomics allows us to identify a number of protein interactions contributing to the basic defects associated with F508del- and G551D-CFTR , two of the most common disease-associated variants in the patient population. We demonstrate that a number of these causal interactions are significantly altered in response to treatment with Vx809 and Vx770 , small-molecule therapeutics that respectively target the F508del and G551D variants. ProVarA represents the first comparative proteomic analysis among multiple disease-causing mutations , thereby providing a methodological approach that provides a significant advancement to existing proteomic efforts in understanding the impact of variation in CF disease. We posit that the implementation of ProVarA for any familial or somatic mutation will provide a substantial increase in the knowledge base needed to implement a precision medicine-based approach for clinical management of disease.
