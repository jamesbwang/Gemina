 In adult spinal deformity , the pedicle subtraction osteotomy is a useful technique to provide correction , especially in rigid , previously fused spines. However , it is not without its complications. In an effort to prevent pseudoarthrosis , a new technique using 4 rods has been pioneered to decrease stress on the 2 long rods while allowing for maintenance of correction with 2 smaller rods. One should also use careful neuromonitoring , especially during closure , to be able to make adjustments in time to prevent the development of neurologic deficits. Nevertheless , significant correction can be achieved and patients ' functional outcomes can be greatly improved.
