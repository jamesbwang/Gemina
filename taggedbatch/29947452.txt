 Antimicrobial resistance is a concern to public health , emphasizing the importance of controlling antibiotic use. This study analyzed the trend in outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in children and adolescents in Korea. Using National Prescribing Sample data from the Korea Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service between January 1 , 2010 and December 31 , 2014 , we analyzed outpatient systemic antibiotic ( ATC J01) prescriptions in patients aged 2-17 years. The antibiotic rate was defined as the proportion of all outpatient prescriptions for antibiotics. We calculated absolute and relative differences with 95 % confidence interval ( CI) between 2010 and 2014 in the antibiotic rate by age group ( 2-6 , 7-11 , and 12-17 years) and the percentage of antibiotic prescriptions by antibiotic class. Seven of the most commonly used antibiotic drugs were identified based on the defined daily doses. A total of 7,261,176 prescriptions were written for 1,039,756 pediatric patients between 2010 and 2014. The antibiotic rate in all patients increased from 34.8 % in 2010 to 70.4 % in 2014 , resulting in the relative difference of 102.1 % ( 95 % CI: 101.7-102.5). Extended spectrum penicillins were the most commonly prescribed antibiotic class , accounting for 40.0-41.0 % of all antibiotic prescriptions. The use of third generation cephalosporins increased steeply with the relative difference of 55.7 % ( 95 % CI: 55.2-56.2). Amoxicillin/clavulanate , an extended spectrum antibiotic drug , was the predominately used antibiotic drug but the use of cefpodoxime , a third generation cephalosporin , increased by 96 %. The use of outpatient antibiotics , especially third generation cephalosporins , increased in children and adolescents in Korea. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
