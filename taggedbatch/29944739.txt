 Papular acantholytic dyskeratosis ( PAD) , sometimes referred to as PAD of the vulvocrural or anogenital area , is an exceedingly rare skin condition , which usually presents in adulthood and features multiple , asymptomatic or pruritic , skin-colored to whitish papules , located in the groin area. PAD exhibits histological features resembling Darier disease ( DD) or Hailey-Hailey disease ( HHD) , including acantholysis , dyskeratosis as well as hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis , but differs from these disorders by absence of family history and confinement of the lesions<symptom> Although previously suggested to be a mosaic form of DD , several studies have demonstrated that PAD is caused by mutations in the ATP2C1 gene , encoding the Golgi hSPCA1 pump , which is defective in HHD , thus suggesting PAD is a variant of HHD or that the two diseases belong to the same clinical spectrum.
