 Gene expression profiling data provide useful information for the investigation of biological function and process. However , identifying a specific expression pattern from extensive time series gene expression data is not an easy task. Clustering , a popular method , is often used to classify similar expression genes , however , genes with a ` desirable ' or ` user-defined ' pattern can not be efficiently detected by clustering methods. To address these limitations , we developed an online tool called GEsture. Users can draw , or graph a curve using a mouse instead of inputting abstract parameters of clustering methods. GEsture explores genes showing similar , opposite and time-delay expression patterns with a gene expression curve as input from time series datasets. We presented three examples that illustrate the capacity of GEsture in gene hunting while following users ' requirements. GEsture also provides visualization tools ( such as expression pattern figure , heat map and correlation network) to display the searching results. The result outputs may provide useful information for researchers to understand the targets , function and biological processes of the involved genes.
