 To compare the diagnostic performance of the two most common approaches of MRI targeted biopsy ( TB)- cognitive registration ( COG-TB) and software fusion ( FUS-TB)- we assessed our institutional experience with both methods. TB has emerged to complement systematic template biopsy ( SB) in prostate cancer ( PCa) diagnosis; however , which MRI targeting methodology is diagnostically better remains unclear. A total of 510 patients underwent TB at our institution before and after the adoption of fusion software with the UroNav platform ( Invivo Corporation , Gainsville , FL). All patients had concurrent 12-core SB. We compared rates of clinically significant PCa detection , and rates of upstaging and missed diagnosis in reference to SB among patients who received COG-TB and patients who received FUS-TB. We also compared both COG-TB and FUS-TB results to their paired SB results. The rates of upstaging or missing clinically significant PCa with FUS-TB ( in reference to SB) was not significantly different from COG-TB ( p = 0.172) , nor was the risk of missing clinically significant PCa different betweenFUS-TB versus COG-TB on logistic regression ( OR = 0.55 , p = 0.106). No significant difference in biopsy outcomes were observed between FUS-TB and COG-TB ( p = 0.171). We did find significant differences between FUS-TB and SB and between COG-TB and SB , with SB finding more clinically insignificant PCa ( p < 0.001 and p = 0.04). In our institutional experience , no significant difference was observed between the diagnostic ability of COG-TB versus FUS-TB for detecting clinically significant PCa. Greater evidence demonstrating an advantage of FUS-TB over COG-TB would be required for clear recommendations in favor of FUS-TB.
