 Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without palate ( NSCL/P) represents a complex condition caused by genetic and environmental factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the EPHA3 polymorphisms and NSCL/P. To investigate the relationship between five EPHA3 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) and NSCL/P , we selected 180 affected patients and 167 normal controls from the Chinese Han Population. EPHA3 SNPs ( rs7650466 , rs1398197 , rs17801309 , rs1054750 , and rs7632427) were genotyped using the SNaPshot technique; bioinformatic analyses were performed to determine if any of them were potentially functional SNPs. The rs7650466 T allele was associated with the incidence of NSCL/P ( OR , 0.211; 95 % CI , 0.131-0.338; adjusted p = 4.881 Ã— 10 Collectively , our data suggest that the EPHA3 rs7650466 polymorphism confers genetic risk for NSCL/P in the Chinese Han Population. Furthermore , rs7650466 is associated with CL/P incidence in stratified analyses , but not with cleft palate only.
