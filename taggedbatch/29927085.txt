 Proteoglycans can be difficult molecules to isolate and analyze due to large mass , charge , and tendency to aggregate or form macromolecular complexes. This unit describes detailed methods for purification of matrix , cell surface , and cytoskeleton-linked proteoglycans. Methods for analysis of glycoaminoglycan size and type and of core protein species are described. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
