 White matter hyperintensity volume ( WMHV) and subclinical brain infarcts ( SBI) are associated with impaired mobility , but less is known about the association of WMHV in specific brain regions. We hypothesized that anterior WMHV would be associated with lower scores on the Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB) , a well-validated mobility scale. The SPPB was measured a median of 5 years after enrollment into the Northern Manhattan MRI sub study. Volumetric distributions for WMHV in 14 brain regions as a proportion of total cranial volume were determined. Multi-variable linear regression was performed to examine the association of SBI and regional log-WMHV with the SPPB score. Among 668 participants with SPPB measurements ( mean 74 ± 9 years , 37 % male and 70 % Hispanic) , the mean SPPB score was 8.2 ± 2.9. Total ( beta = -0.3 per SD , p = 0.001) , anterior periventricular ( beta = -0.4 per SD , p = 0.001) , parietal ( beta = -0.2 per SD , p = 0.02) and frontal ( beta = -0.3 per SD , p = 0.002) WMHVs were associated with SPPB; other WMHV and SBI were not associated with the SPPB. WMHV , especially in the anterior- cerebral regions , is associated with a lower SPPB. Prevention of subclinical cerebrovascular disease is a potential target to prevent physical decline in the elderly.
