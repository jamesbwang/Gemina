 Weekly ixazomib with lenalidomide-dexamethasone ( Rd) is feasible and has shown activity in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma ( NDMM) patients. This phase 1/2 study ( NCT01383928) evaluated the recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D) , pharmacokinetics , safety and efficacy of twice-weekly ixazomib plus Rd in NDMM; 64 patients were enrolled across both phases. Patients received twice-weekly oral ixazomib 3 · 0 or 3 · 7 mg plus lenalidomide 25 mg and dexamethasone 20 mg ( 10 mg in cycles 9-16) for up to sixteen 21-day cycles , followed by maintenance with twice-weekly ixazomib alone. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported in cycle 1; the RP2D was 3 · 0 mg based on overall tolerability across multiple cycles. In 62 evaluable patients , the confirmed overall response rate was 94 % ( 68 % ≥ very good partial response; 24 % complete response). Median progression-free survival was 24 · 9 months. Responses ( median duration 36 · 9 months for patients receiving the RP2D) deepened during treatment. Grade 3 drug-related adverse events ( AEs) occurred in 64 % of patients , including: rash<symptom> , 13 %; peripheral neuropathy , 8 %; hyperglycaemia , 8 %. There were no grade 4 drug-related AEs. Thirteen patients discontinued due to AEs. Twice-weekly ixazomib-Rd offers substantial activity with promising long-term outcomes in NDMM patients but may be associated with greater toxicity compared with weekly ixazomib-Rd in this setting.
