 The growth of animal consumers is affected by the balance<symptom> of elements in their diet with the transition between limitation by one element to another known as the threshold elemental ratio ( TER). Precise estimates of TERs with known levels of uncertainty have yet to be generated for most zooplankton consumers. We determined the TER for carbon ( C) and phosphorus ( P) in for a common lake zooplankter , Daphnia magna<pathogen> , using experimental measurements and theoretical considerations. Daphnia growth responses to food C :P ratios across a relatively narrow range ( 80-350) generated an empirical estimate of TER
