 Complex<pathogen> phenotypes may represent novel syndromes<disease><symptom> that are the composite interaction of several genetic and environmental factors. We describe an 9-year old male with high functioning autism spectrum disorder and Muckle-Wells syndrome<disease><symptom> who at age 5 years of age manifested perseverations that interfered with his functioning at home and at school. After age 6 , he developed intermittent episodes of fatigue<symptom> and somnolence lasting from hours to weeks that evolved over the course of months to more chronic hypersomnia. Whole exome sequencing showed three mutations in genes potentially involved in his clinical phenotype. The patient has a predicted pathogenic
