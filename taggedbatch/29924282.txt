 The aim of this study was to assess the relationship of the rs11191439 and rs3740393 polymorphisms of the Arsenite Methyltransferase ( As3MT) gene with the arsenic urinary excretion profiles in a population in northern Mexico. A crosssectional study was conducted with 102 participants between the ages of 14 and 75 in Comarca Lagunera , Mexico. Speciation of the arsenic urinary metabolites was determined , and DNA was extracted; analysis and amplification of the polymorphisms was made by PCR in real time. A descriptive analysis was carried out and the differences in the urinary arsenic concentrations were assessed according to sex and genotype. The median concentration of arsenic in water was 82 Î¼g/L; the levels of urinary excretion of dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA) were higher in women than in the men. The carriers of the CC genetic variant of the As3MT ( rs3740393) gene showed higher urinary concentrations of methylarsinic acid ( p = 0.01) and DMA ( p = 0.05).
