 Lysyl oxidase-like 2 ( LOXL2) is a copper-dependent monoamine oxidase that contributes to the remodelling of the extracellular matrix ( ECM) by cross linkage of collagen and elastin fibres and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in cancer and fibrosis<disease>. In the skin , LOXL2 is essential for epidermal cell polarity and differentiation. However , its role in the dermis has not been evaluated. We found that Loxl2 is dispensable for mouse dermal development , maturation and homeostasis , yet affects dermal stiffness. Neither loss of Loxl2 nor increased Loxl2 expression affected dermal architecture following treatment with the phorbol ester TPA. Furthermore , Loxl2 expression did not alter the stroma of DMBA-TPA-induced tumours. We conclude that , although Loxl2 is expressed in both dermis and epidermis , its function appears largely confined to the epidermis.
