 A brief period of aphasia<symptom> is an extremely rare and likely underreported adverse effect of electroconvulsive therapy. Clinical studies that have described this phenomenon are scarce and its prevalence is unknown. We present a unique case of a 35-year old woman , who underwent an outpatient ECT session at our department , followed by a short span of aphasic symptoms , the extent of which were monitored clinically and via the czech version of the Minnesota aphasia<symptom> screening test.
