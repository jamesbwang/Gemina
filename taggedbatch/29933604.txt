 By using a multi-scale measurement technique , a high-sensitivity and large dynamic-range sensor array , which consisted of a single resonator and a series of cascaded resonators with a sensing ring and a reference ring , was modeled , and its transmission properties were investigated theoretically and numerically. We also set forth the principle of a multi-scale measurement technique based on the transmission spectrum of a resonator. This sensor array could have a nearly tenfold increase in sensitivity , and an improved dynamic range in an arrow wavelength range. The simulated results were in good agreement with the theoretical analysis.
