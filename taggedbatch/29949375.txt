 We present gate-controlled single- , double- , and triple-dot operation in electrostatically gapped bilayer graphene. Thanks to the recent advancements in sample fabrication , which include the encapsulation of bilayer graphene in hexagonal boron nitride and the use of graphite gates , it has become possible to electrostatically confine carriers in bilayer graphene and to completely pinch-off current through quantum dot devices. Here , we discuss the operation and characterization of electron-hole double dots. We show a remarkable degree of control of our device , which allows the implementation of two different gate-defined electron-hole double-dot systems with very similar energy scales. In the single-dot regime , we extract excited state energies and investigate their evolution in a parallel magnetic field , which is in agreement with a Zeeman-spin-splitting expected for a g-factor of 2.
