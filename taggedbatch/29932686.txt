 A thermodynamically consistent free energy model for fluid flows comprised of one gas and two liquid components is presented and implemented using the entropic lattice Boltzmann scheme. The model allows a high density ratio , up to the order of O ( 10 ^ ( 3)) , between the liquid and gas phases , and a broad range of surface tension ratios , covering partial wetting states where Neumann triangles are formed , and full wetting states where complete encapsulation of one of the fluid components is observed. We further demonstrate that we can capture the bouncing , adhesive , and insertive regimes for the binary collisions between immiscible droplets suspended in air. Our approach opens up a vast range of multiphase flow applications involving one gas and several liquid components.
