 The point of this study is to explore and investigate mechanisms of Buyang Huanwu decoction for treatment of cerebral infarction ( CI) using a network pharmacology approach. First , TCMSP database , DrugBank database and PharmMapper server were used and combined with oral bioavailability and drug analysis to screen the components of Buyang Hanwu decoction and predict the potential targets. Then , Cytoscape 3.5.1 software was used to construct compounds-targets network and the protein-protein interaction ( PPI) networks for targets of compounds and CI-related targets and merge the two PPI networks to acquire active targets. Finally , gene ontology ( GO) and KEGG pathway analysis of active targets were carried out by DAVID online analysis tool and KOBAS 3.0 software. In total of 150 screened compounds and 232 potential targets were obtained. And in total of 208 active targets were finally determined by merging networks. Results indicated that Buyang Huanwu decoction might have a role in treating CI by regulating some biological processes including response to drug , aging , response to hypoxia , and blood coagulation , and some molecular function , such as protein binding , enzyme binding and serine-type endopeptidase activity. The mechanisms might be concerned with PI3K-Akt signaling pathway , TNF signaling pathway , HIF-1 signaling pathway and cAMP signaling pathway. Among them , the regulation of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway might be one of the most crucial mechanisms.
