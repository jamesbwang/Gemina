 Progress has been made into research on new therapies , mechanical and pharmacological approaches and repair/regenerative cellular therapy to treat irreversible cardiovascular pathologies , such as acute myocardial infarction. Research into cellular therapies is exploring the use of new cellular types. Although the therapeutic effects of cell therapy remain modest , results from clinical trials are encouraging. To expand this improvement , advances are being made that involve the paracrine function of stem cells , the use of growth factors , miRNA and new biomaterials. In the near future , these therapies should become part of routine clinical practice.
