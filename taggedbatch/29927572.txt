 The Polo-like kinases ( Plks) are an evolutionary conserved family of Ser/Thr protein kinases that possess , in addition to the classical kinase domain at the N-terminus , a C-terminal polo-box domain ( PBD) that binds to phosphorylated proteins and modulates the kinase activity and its localization. Plk1 , which regulates the formation of the mitotic spindle , has emerged as a validated drug target for the treatment of cancer , because it is required for numerous types of cancer cells but not for the cell division in noncancer cells. Here , we employed chemical biology methods to investigate the allosteric communication between the PBD and the catalytic domain of Plk1. We identified small compounds that bind to the catalytic domain and inhibit or enhance the interaction of Plk1 with the phosphorylated peptide PoloBoxtide in vitro. In cells , two new allosteric Plk1 inhibitors affected the proliferation of cancer cells in culture and the cell cycle but had distinct phenotypic effects on spindle formation. Both compounds inhibited Plk1 signaling , indicating that they specifically act on Plk1 in cultured cells.
