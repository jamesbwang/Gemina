 Hemangioblastomas are benign tumors of the central nervous system ( CNS) that may occur either sporadically or as part of von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL) disease , in which they coexist with a series of other tumors outside the CNS. Because of their low mitosis rate , hemangioblastomas usually have slow-growing and late manifestations , but may cause sudden neurological<symptom> symptoms<symptom> if tumor hemorrhage<symptom> occurs. Few studies have evaluated the impact of pregnancy on the evolution of hemangioblastomas. Some authors have reported tumor growth in women with VHL disease , but no such association was observed by others. The influence of pregnancy on sporadic hemangioblastomas remains largely unexplored. We report here the case of a pregnant woman whose first manifestation of sporadic spinal hemangioblastoma was life-threatening , rapidly progressive dysautonomia. In addition , we discuss the role of pregnancy in the triggering of symptoms , as well as the possibility of medically indicated delivery for the management of these tumors.
