 Kafirins are the major storage proteins in sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor) grains and form protein bodies with poor digestibility. Since kafirins are devoid of the essential amino acid lysine , they also impart poor protein quality to the kernel. The α-kafirins , which make up most of the total kafirins , are largely encoded by the k1C family of highly similar genes. We used a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR)/ CRISPR-associated protein 9 ( Cas9) gene editing approach to target the k1C genes to create variants with reduced kafirin levels and improved protein quality and digestibility. A single guide RNA ( sgRNA) was designed to introduce mutations in a conserved region encoding the endoplasmic reticulum signal peptide of α-kafirins. Sequencing of kafirin PCR products revealed extensive edits in 25 of 26 events in one or multiple k1C family members. T1 and T2 seeds showed reduced α-kafirin levels , and selected T2 events showed significantly increased grain protein digestibility and lysine content. Thus , a single consensus sgRNA carrying target sequence mismatches is sufficient for extensive editing of all k1C genes. The resulting quality improvements can be rapidly deployed for breeding and generation of transgene-free , improved cultivars of sorghum , a major crop worldwide.
