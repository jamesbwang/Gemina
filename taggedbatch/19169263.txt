 To investigate the effects of sequential nutritional support on nutritional status and immune regulation in patients with early severe traumatic brain injury ( STBI). A total of 62 patients diagnosed with STBI enrolled from Chaoyang Hospital ( Beijing , China) from February 2015 to October 2016 were divided into two groups. The observational group ( n = 34) was given sequential nutritional support and the control group ( n = 28) was given the standard formula of whole protein enteral preparations. The energy supply for the two groups was 30 kcal/kg/d and protein 1.6 g/kg/d , respectively. The albumin ( ALB) , total protein ( TP) , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( Hs-CRP) , neuron-specific enolase ( NSE) , Glasgow Coma<symptom> Score ( GCS) , and regulatory T cells before and after nutritional treatment were measured in both groups. At the 14th day , the levels of ALB ( 41.7 ± 4.2 g/L) and TP ( 70.6 ± 4.9 g/L) were significantly higher than those in the control group ( 33.5 ± 2.3 g/L and 62.3 ± 3.9 g/L) ( The effect of sequential nutritional support is better than conventional nutritional support in patients with STBI. The findings call for early identification of malnutrition and individual nutritional support.
