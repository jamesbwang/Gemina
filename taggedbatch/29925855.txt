 We explored the clinico-genetic basis of spinocerebellar ataxia<symptom> 29 ( SCA29) by determining the frequency , phenotype , and functional impact of ITPR1 missense variants associated with early-onset ataxia<symptom> ( EOA). Three hundred thirty one patients from a European EOA target cohort ( n = 120) , US-American EOA validation cohort ( n = 72) , and early-onset epileptic encephalopathy ( EOEE) control cohort ( n = 139) were screened for de novo ITPR1 variants. The target cohort was also screened for inherited ITPR1 variants. The variants ' functional impact was determined by IP3-induced Ca
