 Accumulating evidence confirms that the exposure of neonatal rats to maternal separation can significantly alter individual processes of postnatal neurogenesis in the olfactory neurogenic region- the subventricular zone ( SVZ) and the rostral migratory stream ( RMS). To establish the stressful influence of MS on postnatal neurogenesis we have investigated whether altered olfactory environment caused by short-term MS induces expression of Fos protein in the SVZ/RMS and in the olfactory cortical area- anterior olfactory nucleus ( AON) of neonatal rats. Pups were separated from mothers for 2 hours at the postnatal days 7 , 14 and 21. Immunohistochemically labeled Fos protein was assessed. Our results revealed that single exposure to MS is a stressful event that selectively and in age-dependent manner stimulates cellular activity in the SVZ and AON. A few Fos + cells were found in the SVZ of P21 control animals and MS significantly increased their number. This suggests that some SVZ cells are included in the circuitry , which is activated by MS and that these cells have complete equipment for the Fos signal transduction. MS significantly increased the number of Fos + cells in the AON in all age stages examined suggesting that its effect is mediated by olfaction.
