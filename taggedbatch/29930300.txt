 The R98S mutation in ribosomal protein L10 ( RPL10 R98S) affects 8 % of pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( T-ALL) cases , and was previously described to impair cellular proliferation. The current study reveals that RPL10 R98S cells accumulate reactive oxygen species which promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced ATP levels , causing the proliferation defect. RPL10 R98S mutant leukemia<disease> cells can survive high oxidative stress levels via a specific increase of IRES-mediated translation of the anti-apoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma 2 ( BCL-2) , mediating BCL-2 protein overexpression. RPL10 R98S selective sensitivity to the clinically available Bcl-2 inhibitor Venetoclax ( ABT-199) was supported by suppression of splenomegaly<symptom> and the absence of human leukemia<disease> cells in the blood of T-ALL xenografted mice. These results shed new light on the oncogenic function of ribosomal mutations in cancer , provide a novel mechanism for BCL-2 upregulation in leukemia<disease> , and highlight BCL-2 inhibition as a novel therapeutic opportunity in RPL10 R98S defective T-ALL.
