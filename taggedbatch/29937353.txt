 Unconventional oil and natural gas ( UOG) operations have contributed to a surge in domestic oil and natural gas production in the United States , combining horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing to unlock previously inaccessible fossil fuel deposits. > 1000 organic chemicals are used in the production process , and wastewater is produced following injection and for the life of the producing well. This wastewater is typically disposed of via injecting into disposal wells for long-term storage , treatment and discharge from wastewater treatment plants , and/or storage in open evaporation pits; however , wastewater spill rates are reported at 2-20 % of active well sites across regions , increasing concerns about the environmental impacts of these wastewaters. This study assessed adipogenic activity ( both triglyceride accumulation and pre-adipocyte proliferation) for a mixture of 23 commonly used UOG chemicals and a small subset of UOG wastewater-impacted surface water extracts from Colorado and West Virginia , using 3T3-L1 cells and a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ( PPARγ) reporter assay. We report potent and efficacious adipogenic activity induced by both a laboratory-created UOG chemical mixture and UOG-impacted water samples at concentrations below environmental levels. We further report activation of PPARγ at similar concentrations for some samples , suggesting a causative molecular pathway for the observed effects , but not for other adipogenic samples , implicating PPARγ-dependent and independent effects from UOG associated chemicals. Taken together , these results suggest that UOG wastewater has the potential to impact metabolic health at environmentally relevant concentrations.
