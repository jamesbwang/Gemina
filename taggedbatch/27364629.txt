 To determine the aqueous humor levels of cytokines in eyes with type 1 retinopathy of prematurity ( ROP) before primary intravitreal injection of ranibizumab ( IVR). Forty-nine infants with type 1 ROP ( 56 eyes of 28 infants in the threshold ROP group and 42 eyes of 21 infants in the type 1 pre-threshold ROP group) received primary IVR and 49 aqueous humor samples were obtained preoperatively. Aqueous humor samples from 15 infants ( 15 eyes) undergoing congenital cataract surgery were used as controls. The concentrations of 27 cytokines were measured by a multiplex bead assay. Infants with persistent , recurrent , or progressive ROP after IVR were retreated. The preoperative aqueous levels of 16 cytokines were significantly different among type 1 pre-threshold , threshold ROP , and control groups ( P < 0.05). The concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) ( P < 0.001) , interferon-γ ( P < 0.001) , interleukin ( IL) -10 ( P < 0.001) , and IL-12 ( P < 0.001) were the highest in the threshold ROP group , less in the type 1 pre-threshold ROP group , and the lowest in the control group. Retreatment was given to 55 % of infants with ROP within a 48-week follow-up period after primary IVR. Higher VEGF ( hazard ratio ( HR) = 1.001 , P = 0.001) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β ( HR = 1.085 , P = 0.022) levels were independently correlated with ROP retreatment. Higher aqueous levels of VEGF and inflammatory cytokines were associated with more severe type 1 ROP and ROP retreatment after primary IVR.
