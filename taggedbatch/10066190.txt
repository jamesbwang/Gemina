 The purpose of this report is to describe the interventions implemented between 2012 and 2017 at the National Cancer Institute Paraguay ( NCI Paraguay) to improve treatment quality and efficiency for patients with cervical cancer , with an emphasis on radiation quality and access. The NCI Paraguay requested collaboration with Health Volunteers Overseas ( HVO) , an international volunteer organization , to improve the care of patients with cervical cancer. This report is based on site visits to NCI Paraguay by HVO volunteers in 2012 , 2013 , and 2016 , with a follow-up report from the site in 2017. During the study period , increased access to external beam radiation and brachytherapy led to a decrease in wait time to start radiation from 2 to 3 months to 4-6 weeks. The center transitioned from 2-dimensional ( 2D) to 3-D planning and was able to offer concurrent chemotherapy and radiation , including brachytherapy , to patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. Based on the American Society of Clinical Oncology 's resource-stratified clinical guidelines , from 2012 to 2017 , the practice transitioned from a `` basic setting '' to an `` enhanced setting ''.
