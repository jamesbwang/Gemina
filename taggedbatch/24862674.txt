 The benefits of single-use ultrasonic scissors in thyroid surgery are still debated. Although this device has been shown to reduce operating time compared with conventional haemostasis , its cost-effectiveness has never been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy , cost-effectiveness and safety of ultrasonic scissors for total thyroidectomy. This was a prospective , randomized , multicentre trial conducted at 13 hospital sites. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with hypocalcaemia ( serum calcium level below 2 mmol/l) on day 2. Secondary endpoints included postoperative complications and costs , with calculation of incremental cost differences and cost-effectiveness ratios. In total , 1329 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy were included in the analysis: 670 were randomized to treatment with ultrasonic scissors and 659 to conventional haemostasis. There was no difference between groups in the rate of complications , including hypocalcaemia on day 2 ( 19 Ultrasonic scissors were no more clinically effective than conventional haemostasis , but use of these devices was more costly.
