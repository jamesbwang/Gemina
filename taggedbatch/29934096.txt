 The aim of this study was to biomechanically compare three different fixation methods for the fixation of anterior column posterior hemitransverse type acetabular fracture ( ACPHT). ACPHT fracture models were created on twenty-four foam cortical shell artificial hemipelvis models. Three fixation methods were assessed- Group 1: posterior column lag screws over a suprapectineal plate; Group 2: Posterior column lag screws over a suprapectineal plate and an infrapectineal plate; Group 3: A suprapectineal plate and a vertical infrapectineal plate. Stiffness and displacement amounts of fixation methods under dynamic and static axial loading conditions were measured. In the dynamic and static tests , Group 3 showed the less stable fixation compared to Group 2. There was no statistically significant difference between the stiffness values of the fixation groups. In the static tests , there was no statistically significant difference between Group 1 and 2 , although less displacements were obtained in Group 2. A combination of posterior lag screws over a suprapectineal plate and an infrapectineal plate supporting the pelvic brim along both sides of the linea terminalis resulted in a better fixation construct than a suprapectineal plate accompanying with a vertical infrapectineal plate provide better stability with less fracture displacement.
