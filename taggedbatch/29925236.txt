 A general Pd-catalyzed intermolecular reductive Heck reaction of both terminal and internal unactivated aliphatic alkenes has been first developed. This method affords γ- and δ-arylated alkyl carboxylic acid derivatives in high yields with complete anti-Markovnikov selectivity. Notably , the coupling process is stereoretentive for the alkyl chain. Mechanistically , alkyl palladacycle intermediates stabilized by directing group and ligand , hydride species multigenerated from PS/TFA reductant , are two key factors that successfully promote the reaction and regioselectivity.
