 Vertebral augmentation procedures such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are utilized in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures ( VCFs). However , their capacity for providing analgesia , reducing disability , and improving quality of life in patients with osteoporotic VCFs remains a topic of debate. The objective of this narrative review is to summarize the latest evidence for the safety and efficacy of vertebral augmentation for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures ( VCFs). A systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed and Cochrane electronic databases for systematic reviews , review articles , meta-analyses , and randomized clinical trials prior to May 2017. The keywords were `` vertebroplasty , '' `` kyphoplasty , '' and `` vertebral augmentation. '' Thirty-three papers ( 7 systematic reviews , 6 cohort studies , 15 randomized clinical trials , and 5 international guidelines) were included in this narrative review. Vertebral augmentation is a safe procedure , with low rates of serious complications and no increase in subsequent post-treatment fracture risk.
