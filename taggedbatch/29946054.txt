 Intestinal TG-rich lipoproteins ( TRLs) are important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in insulin resistance ( IR). We investigated the association of plasma proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( PCSK9) concentrations with apoB-48-containing TRL metabolism in 148 men displaying various degrees of IR by measuring in vivo kinetics of TRL apoB-48 during a constant-fed state after a primed-constant infusion of L- ( 5,5,5-D3) leucine. Plasma PCSK9 concentrations positively correlated with TRL apoB-48 pool size ( r = 0.31 , p = 0.0002) and production rate ( r = 0.24 , p = 0.008) but not fractional catabolic rate ( r = -0.04 , p = 0.6). Backward stepwise multiple linear regression analysis identified PCSK9 concentrations as a positive predictor of TRL apoB-48 production rate ( standard Î² = +0.20 , p = 0.007) independent of BMI , age , type 2 diabetes/metformin use , dietary fat intake during the kinetic study , and fasting concentrations of TGs , insulin , glucose , LDL cholesterol , or C reactive protein. We also assessed intestinal expression of key genes involved in chylomicron processing from duodenal samples of 71 men. Expression of PCSK9 and HMG-CoAR genes was positively associated ( r = 0.43 , p = 0.002). These results support PCSK9 association with intestinal secretion and plasma overaccumulation of TRL apoB-48 in men with IR.
