 DNA interstrand crosslinks ( ICLs) are extremely cytotoxic , but the mechanism of their repair remains incompletely understood. Using Xenopus egg extracts , we previously showed that repair of a cisplatin ICL is triggered when two replication forks converge on the lesion<symptom>. After CDC45/MCM2 -7/ GINS ( CMG) ubiquitylation and unloading by the p97 segregase , FANCI-FANCD2 promotes DNA incisions by XPF-ERCC1 , leading to ICL unhooking. Here , we report that , during this cell-free ICL repair reaction , one of the two converged forks undergoes reversal. Fork reversal fails when CMG unloading is inhibited , but it does not require FANCI-FANCD2. After one fork has undergone reversal , the opposing fork that still abuts the ICL undergoes incisions. Our data show that replication fork reversal at an ICL requires replisome disassembly. We present a revised model of ICL repair that involves a reversed fork intermediate.
