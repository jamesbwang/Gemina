 Pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma ( PPC) has a poor prognosis due to the poor results of treatment with systemic chemotherapy. We report the case of a 73-year-old woman with PPC who showed a favorable response to nivolumab. As first-line treatment for postoperative recurrence , she received carboplatin and nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel. However , 12 months later , a new metastatic lymph node appeared. Nivolumab was administered as second-line treatment , and the patient showed a favorable prolonged response. The effects of treatment of PPC with nivolumab seem promising. The results of a future prospective study are expected to identify indicators for the treatment of PPC.
