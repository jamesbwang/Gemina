 The wax-made comb of the honeybee is a masterpiece of animal architecture. The highly regular , double-sided hexagonal structure is a near-optimal solution to storing food and housing larvae , economizing on building materials and space. Elaborate though they may seem , such animal constructions are often viewed as the result of ` just instinct , ' governed by inflexible , pre-programmed , innate behavior routines. An inspection of the literature on honeybee comb construction , however , reveals a different picture. Workers have to learn , at least in part , certain elements of the technique , and there is considerable flexibility in terms of how the shape of the comb and its gradual manufacture is tailored to the circumstances , especially the available space. Moreover , we explore the 2-century old and now largely forgotten work by Fran√ßois Huber , where glass screens were placed between an expanding comb construction and the intended target wall. Bees took corrective action before reaching the glass obstacle , and altered the ongoing construction so as to reach the nearest wooden wall. Though further experiments will be necessary , these results suggest a form of spatial planning skills. We discuss these findings in the context of what is now known about insect cognition , and ask if it is possible that the production of hexagonal wax combs is the result of behavioral heuristics where a complex structure emerges as the result of simple behavioral rules applied by each individual , or whether prospective cognition might be involved.
