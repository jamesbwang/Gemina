 Long noncoding RNA colon cancer-associated transcript 1 ( lncRNA CCAT1) is highly expressed in gastric cancer ( GC) tissues compared with normal counterparts and CCAT1 upregulation can promote proliferation and migration of GC cells in vitro. B-cell specific moloney leukemia<disease> virus insertion site 1 ( Bmi-1) expression is positively correlated with tumor progression. The present study aimed to investigate the biological functions of CCAT1 and the relationships between CCAT1 and Bmi-1 in GC progression. In the present study , CCAT1 was knocked down by specific shRNA transfection in two human GC cell lines ( MGC-803 and SGC-7901). The effects of CCAT1 knockdown on GC cell proliferation , cell cycle , migration and invasion were investigated in vitro. The effect of CCAT1 knockdown on peritoneal metastasis was assessed in nude mice. Bmi-1 expression levels were examined both in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that CCAT1 knockdown markedly inhibited cell proliferation , migration and invasion , arrested the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase in vitro , and inhibited peritoneal metastasis in nude mice , along with the downregulation of Bmi-1. Taken together , CCAT1 is functionally involved in growth and metastasis of GC cells and it may be a potential target for GC therapy.
