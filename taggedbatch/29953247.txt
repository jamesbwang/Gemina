 Beyond finding inhibitors that show high binding affinity to the respective target , there is the challenge of optimizing their properties with respect to metabolic and toxicological issues , as well as further off-target effects. To reduce the experimental effort of synthesizing and testing actual substances in corresponding assays , virtual screening has become an indispensable toolbox in preclinical development. The scope of application covers the prediction of molecular properties including solubility , metabolic liability and binding to antitargets , such as the hERG channel. Furthermore , prediction of binding sites and drugable targets are emerging aspects of virtual screening. Issues involved with the currently applied computational models including machine learning algorithms are outlined , such as limitations to the accuracy of prediction and overfitting.
