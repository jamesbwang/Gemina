 Human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) is currently the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States , with potentially serious health consequences , including cervical cancer. Young adults are particularly at risk of infection , but many remain unvaccinated. Low health literacy may contribute to poor knowledge of HPV<pathogen> and lack of vaccine uptake , and women living in the Southeastern United States are particularly at risk for lower vaccination rates and cervical cancer screening adherence. Three-hundred-sixty undergraduates at a Southeastern U.S. University completed measures of health literacy , sexual attitudes , and HPV<pathogen> knowledge in 2016. Less than half of both male and female participants had completed an HPV<pathogen> vaccine series , and there were no differences in health literacy scores between participants who had completed a vaccine series and those who had not. Forty subjects were familiar with HPV<pathogen> vaccines but not the virus itself. More than half of these individuals had received at least one dose of an HPV<pathogen> vaccine , highlighting a lack of knowledge regarding the purpose of this vaccine. While health literacy was not related to vaccination status , it was associated with greater knowledge of both HPV<pathogen> and available vaccines. Participants who were familiar with HPV<pathogen> had higher health literacy than participants who were not. College students hold serious misconceptions about HPV<pathogen> that may be redressed through public health education programs to increase health literacy and knowledge. Such public health interventions would potentially increase HPV<pathogen> vaccine uptake , leading to decreased cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates.
