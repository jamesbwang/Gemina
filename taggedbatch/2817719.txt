 A 37-year-old man complained of a refractory posterior malleolar ulceration on his left ankle. He was diagnosed with Werner syndrome<disease><symptom> according to the progeroid clinical features and genetic testing. To approach the ulceration , a free flow-through right anterolateral thigh perforator flap with anterolateral thigh cutaneous nerve was harvested. One year later , he was readmitted due to a new ulceration on his right ankle. We harvested the left anterolateral thigh perforator flap with anterolateral thigh cutaneous nerve to reconstruct the defect. After one more year of follow-up , there was no recurrence of ulcers<disease><symptom> , and the sensation of the flap recovered partially after 6 months. We conclude that free flow-through anterolateral thigh perforator flap is a feasible choice for the repair of foot ulcers<disease><symptom> in Werner syndrome<disease><symptom>.
