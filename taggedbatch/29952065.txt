 There is an increasing demand for the development of a simple Si-based universal memory device at the nanoscale that operates at high frequencies. Spin-electronics ( spintronics) can , in principle , increase the efficiency of devices and allow them to operate at high frequencies. A primary challenge for reducing the dimensions of spintronic devices is the requirement for high spin currents. To overcome this problem , a new approach is presented that uses helical chiral molecules exhibiting spin-selective electron transport , which is called the chiral-induced spin selectivity ( CISS) effect. Using the CISS effect , the active memory device is miniaturized for the first time from the micrometer scale to 30 nm in size , and this device presents memristor-like nonlinear logic operation at low voltages under ambient conditions and room temperature. A single nanoparticle , along with Au contacts and chiral molecules , is sufficient to function as a memory device. A single ferromagnetic nanoplatelet is used as a fixed hard magnet combined with Au contacts in which the gold contacts act as soft magnets due to the adsorbed chiral molecules.
