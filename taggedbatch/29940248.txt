 The relative value of rigid or elastic registration during Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI)/ Ultrasound ( US) fusion guided prostate biopsy ( FBx) has been poorly studied. This study compared registration error ( RE) between rigid and elastic registration during FBx using a prostate phantom model. Four gold fiducial markers , visible on MRI and US , were placed throughout one phantom prostate model. The phantom underwent MRI and fiducial markers were labeled as regions of interest ( ROIs). Both an experienced and novice FBx user targeted ROIs and then the corresponding fiducial with US after rigid , and then elastic registration. REs ( distance between ROI and fiducial markers) were compared. A total of 224 RE measurements were recorded. Overall , elastic registration did not provide significantly improved RE over rigid registration ( 4.87 ± 3.50 vs 4.11 ± 2.09 mm , p = 0.05). However , lesions<symptom> near the phantom 's edge experienced increased RE when using elastic registration ( 5.70 ± 3.43 vs 3.23 ± 1.68 mm , p = 0.03). The experienced user reported reduced RE with rigid ( 3.25 ± 1.49 vs 4.98 ± 2.10 mm , p < 0.01) and elastic registration ( 3.94 ± 2.61 vs 6.07 ± 4.16 mm , p < 0.01) compared to the novice user. We found no difference in RE between rigid or elastic registration overall but indicated that rigid registration reduced the RE for targets near the prostate edge. Additionally , operator experience reduces RE regardless of registration method. Therefore , the use of elastic registration algorithms can not act as a replacement for attention to detail during the registration process and use of anatomical landmarks indicating accurate registration when beginning the procedure and before targeting each region of interest.
