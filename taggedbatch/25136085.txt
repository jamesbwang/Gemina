 Violent aggression in humans may involve a modified response to stress , but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we show that naturally present autoantibodies reactive to adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH) exhibit distinct epitope-binding profiles to ACTH peptide in subjects with a history of violent aggression compared with controls. Namely , while nonaggressive male controls displayed a preferential IgG binding to the ACTH central part ( amino acids 11-24) , subjects who had committed violent acts of aggression had IgG with increased affinity to ACTH , preferentially binding to its N terminus ( amino acids 1-13). Purified IgGs from approximately half of the examined sera were able to block ACTH-induced cortisol secretion of human adrenal cells in vitro , irrespective of the source of sample ( from a control subject or a violent aggressor). Nevertheless , in the resident-intruder test in mice , i.p. injection of residents with ACTH and IgG from aggressive subjects , but not from control subjects , shortened latency for the first attack against intruders. Immunohistochemical screening of violent aggressors ' sera on rat brain and pituitary sections did not show IgG binding to ACTH-producing cells , but 4 of 16 sera revealed selective binding to a nonidentified antigen in vasopressinergic neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Thus , the data show that ACTH-reactive plasmatic IgGs exhibit differential epitope preference in control and violently aggressive subjects. These IgGs can modulate ACTH-induced cortisol secretion and , hence , are involved in the regulation of the stress response. However , the possible role of ACTH-reactive autoantibodies in aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom> needs further investigation.
