 Previous studies attempted to characterize the subjects with sarcoidosis according to differences in sex , age , and the presence of specific organ involvement. However , significant interactions among these factors precluded a clear conclusion based on simple comparison. This study aimed to clarify the age- and sex-stratified prevalence of specific organ involvement and the heterogenous nature of sarcoidosis. Using the data of 9,965 patients who were newly registered into a database at the Ministry of Health , Labour and Welfare , Japan between 2002 and 2011 , we evaluated the age- and sex-specific prevalence of the eye , lung , and skin involvement of sarcoidosis. We also attempted corresponding analysis considering multiple factors. As compared with several decades ago , the monophasic age distribution in men became biphasic , and the biphasic distribution in women , monophasic. The prevalence of pulmonary and cutaneous lesions<symptom> was significantly associated with age , whereas the prevalence of ocular involvement showed a biphasic pattern. The prevalence of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy<disease><symptom> was significantly higher , whereas the prevalence of diffuse lung shadow was significantly lower , in subjects with ocular involvement than those without ocular involvement. Corresponding analysis visually clarified the complex interactions among factors. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the heterogeneous features of sarcoidosis.
