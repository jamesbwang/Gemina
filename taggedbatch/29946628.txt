 The genomic DNA is enveloped by nanotubes formed by the nuclear aggregates of polyamines ( NAPs) that induce DNA conformational changes and provide protection and increased interaction abilities for the double strands. In a physiological environment , the nanotube arrangement is initiated by spontaneous interaction among the terminal amino groups of the polyamines and the phosphate ions , with the consequent formation of cyclic monomers that hook at the DNA grooves. The polymer thus formed has the morphological features of an organic semiconductor and therefore , it can be considered to be able to conduct electric charges. Phosphate ions positioned on the NAP external surface could regulate , as in a physical electric circuit , both linear and rotational ( histones) protein motion , in accordance with the basilar principles of the electronics. A model of a carrier system for protein motion along the polymer wrapping the DNA strands , based on the phosphate-phosphate complexation , is proposed.
