 The study objective was to determine the prevalence of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> colonisation in the nares and oropharynx of healthy persons and identify any risk factors associated with such S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> colonisation. In total 263 participants ( 177 adults and 86 minors) comprising 95 families were enrolled in a year-long prospective cohort study from one urban and one rural county in eastern Iowa , USA , through local newspaper advertisements and email lists and through the Keokuk Rural Health Study. Potential risk factors including demographic factors , medical history , farming and healthcare exposure were assessed. Among the participants , 25.4 % of adults and 36.1 % minors carried S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> in their nares and 37.9 % of adults carried it in their oropharynx. The overall prevalence was 44.1 % among adults and 36.1 % for minors. Having at least one positive environmental site for S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> in the family home was associated with colonisation ( prevalence ratio: 1.34 , 95 % CI: 1.07-1.66). The sensitivity of the oropharyngeal<disease> cultures was greater than that of the nares cultures ( 86.1 % compared with 58.2 % , respectively). In conclusion , the nares and oropharynx are both important colonisation sites for healthy community members and the presence of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> in the home environment is associated with an increased probability of colonisation.
