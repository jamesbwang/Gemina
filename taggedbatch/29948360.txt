 The proportion of antimicrobial resistance ( AMR) among the ESKAPE and Escherichia<pathogen> coli ( ESKAPEEc) pathogens causing bloodstream infection ( BSI) increased worldwide. We described longitudinal trends in ESKAPEEc BSI and AMR over 9 years ( 2007-2015) at a large teaching hospital in Italy. Of 9720 unique BSI episodes , 6002 ( 61.7 %) were caused by ESKAPEEc pathogens. The majority of these episodes ( 4374; 72.9 %) were hospital-onset infections. The most frequent pathogen was E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( 32.8 %) , followed by Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( 20.6 %) , Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( 16.1 %) , and Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> ( 11.6 %). There was a significant increase of hospital-onset K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( from 2.3 to 5.0 per 10,000 patient-days; P = 0.001) and community-onset E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( from 3.3 to 9. 1 per 10,000 emergency admissions; P = 0.04) BSIs. Among hospital-onset BSIs , increases of extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase ( ESBL)- producing E.<pathogen> coli ( from 25.4 to 35.2 % , P = 0.006) , carbapenemase-producing K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( from 4.2 to 51.6 % , P < 0.001) , and methicillin-resistant S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( from 33.9 to 44.4 % , P < 0.001) BSIs were observed between the 2007-2009 and 2010-2012 study periods. In contrast , a decrease of BSIs caused by P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> resistant to ceftazidime ( from 45.5 to 28.2 % , P < 0.001) , ciprofloxacin ( from 46 to 36.3 % , P = 0.05) , and meropenem ( from 55 to 39.9 % , P = 0.03) was observed through all 9 years of the study period. Among community-onset BSIs , increases of BSIs caused by ESBL-producing E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( from 28.6 to 42.2 % , P = 0.002) and carbapenemase-producing K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( from 0 to 17.6 %) were observed between the 2007-2009 and 2010-2012 study periods. Our findings show increased rates of BSI and relative AMR for specific pathogen-health care setting combinations , and call for continued active surveillance and infection control policies.
