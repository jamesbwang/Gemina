 Pestalopezia brunneopruinosa , the type species of Pestalopezia in Leotiomycetes , produces typical cup-shaped ascomata. Because its asexual morph has conidia comprised of five cells including apical and basal appendages and three pigmented median cells , it was first described as Pestalotia gibbosa , which belongs to Sordariomycetes. This contradiction has not been resolved due to the difficulty in isolating this fungus in culture. In this study , we isolated separate strains from the sexual morph and the asexual morph for molecular analysis. Phylogenetic trees of Sporocadaceae based on internal transcribed spacer , partial Î²-tubulin , and partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha sequence datasets revealed that both strains fall into the same taxon , in a clade in Pestalotiopsis sensu stricto alongside P. gaultheriae and P. spathulata. We provide the first evidence that fungi<pathogen> producing cup-shaped ascomata in Pestalotiopsis belong to Sordariomycetes , and we have proposed the transfer of Pestalopezia brunneopruinosa to Pestalotiopsis gibbosa.
