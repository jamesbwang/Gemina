 Understanding population change is essential for conservation of imperiled species , such as amphibians. Worldwide amphibian declines have provided an impetus for investigating their population dynamics , which can involve both extrinsic ( density-independent) and intrinsic ( density-dependent) drivers acting differentially across multiple life stages or age classes. In this study , we examined the population dynamics of the endangered Barton Springs Salamander (
