 Cobamides ( Cbas) are synthesized by many archaea , but some aspects of Cba biosynthesis in these microorganisms remain unclear. Here , we demonstrate that open reading frame MM2060 in the archaeum Methanosarcina mazei strain GÃ¶1 encodes a bifunctional enzyme with l-threonine- O-3-phosphate ( l-Thr-P) decarboxylase ( EC 4.1.1.81) and l-Thr kinase activities ( EC 2.7.1.177). In Salmonella<pathogen> enterica<pathogen> , where Cba biosynthesis has been extensively studied , the activities mentioned above are encoded by separate genes , namely , cobD and pduX , respectively. The activities associated with the MM2060 protein ( MmCobD) were validated in vitro and in vivo. In vitro , MmCobD used ATP and l-Thr as substrates and generated ADP , l-Thr-P , and ( R) -1-aminopropan-2-ol O-phosphate as products. Notably , MmCobD has a 111-amino acid C-terminal extension of unknown function , which contains a putative metal-binding motif. This C-terminal domain alone did not display activity either in vivo or in vitro. Although the C-terminal MmCobD domain was not required for l-Thr-P decarboxylase or l-Thr kinase activities in vivo , its absence negatively affected both activities. In vitro results suggested that this domain may have a regulatory or substrate-gating role. When purified under anoxic conditions , MmCobD displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics and had a 1000-fold higher affinity for ATP and a catalytic efficiency 1300-fold higher than that of MmCobD purified under oxic conditions. To the best of our knowledge , MmCobD is the first example of a new class of l-Thr-P decarboxylases that also have l-Thr kinase activity. An archaeal protein with l-Thr kinase activity had not been identified prior to this work.
