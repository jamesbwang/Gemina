 About 60,000-70,000 tons of 2-chlorotoluene , which shows high toxicity in aquatic ecosystems , are produced worldwide and used in a tremendous field of applications. However , clear proofs of biodegradation were only presented for Comamonas<pathogen> testosteroni<pathogen> KT5 and Rhodococcus<pathogen> sp.. OCT10. Hence , this study aims on the isolation of additional strains and their characterization in pilot-scale biotrickling filters. Three strains named OCT2 , OCT9 , and OCT14 of the genus Rhodococcus<pathogen> were isolated , able to mineralize gaseous 2-chlorotoluene like the previously isolated strain Rhodococcus<pathogen> sp.. OCT10. The performance levels of these strains were tested in four biotrickling filters each containing 18.8 L of polyurethane foam package , showing elimination capacities of carbon ( C) of 30.9 ( OCT2) , 30.1 ( OCT9) , 32.2 ( OCT10) , and 3.9 g C Â· m
