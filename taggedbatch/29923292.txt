 As part of our research project to understand why dietary polyphenols with the catechol skeleton tend to exhibit cancer chemopreventive activity , a catechol-type resveratrol analog ( 3,4-dihydroxy-trans-stilbene ( 3,4-DHS)) was selected to probe its antiangiogenic effects and mechanisms. The antiangiogenic effects of 3,4-DHS on angiogenesis-related endothelial cell functions were examined , including migration , invasion , and tube formation , and in vivo angiogenesis on a chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. The potential molecular mechanisms for the suppression of cell migration by 3,4-DHS were analyzed using various specific inhibitors. 3,4-DHS was identified as a potent angiogenesis inhibitor by constructing an efficient catalytic redox cycle with intracellular copper ions and NAD ( P) H quinone oxidoreductase I to generate reactive oxygen species and thereby downregulate matrix metalloproteinase-9. This work provides further evidence that dietary catechols manifest antiangiogenic activity by virtue of their copper-dependent prooxidative instead of antioxidative role , and useful information for designing polyphenol-inspired angiogenesis inhibitors.
