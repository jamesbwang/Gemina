 Vascular calcification is a frequent complication of advanced chronic kidney disease. Protein carbamylation is implicated in the acceleration of vascular disease in chronic kidney disease , but the mechanisms are not clear. Mori et al. report that protein carbamylation exacerbates vascular calcification by decreasing ectonucleotide pyrophosphate/phosphodiesterase 1 expression , owing to carbamylation of mitochondrial proteins and oxidative stress. This provides new insight into the pathways responsible for calcification in chronic kidney disease.
