 Stem cells are well-known for their great capacity for tissue regeneration. This provides a promising source for cell-based therapies in treating various bone degenerative disorders. However , the major hurdles for their application in transplantation are the poor bone<disease> marrow homing and engraftment efficiencies. Stromal cell-derived factor 1 ( SDF-1) has been identified as a major stem cell homing factor. With the aims of bone targeted SDF-1 delivery and regulating MSCs migration , alendronate modified liposomal nanoparticles ( Aln-Lipo) carrying SDF-1 gene were developed in this study. Alendronate modification significantly increased the mineral binding affinity of liposomes , and facilitated the gene delivery to osteoblastic cells. Up-regulated SDF-1 expression in osteoblasts triggered MSCs migration. Systemic infusion of Aln-Lipo-SDF-1 with fluorescence labeling in mice showed the accumulation in osseous tissue by biophotonic imaging. Corresponding to the delivered SDF-1 , the transplanted GFP
