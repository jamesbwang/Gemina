 Nurses are involved in delivering care for patients following acute traumatic spinal<disease> cord injury throughout the entire care journey. An injury of this type is significant for the individual and their family and can be challenging for nurses delivering care for patients with life changing injuries , especially for nurses new to this setting. There is a lack of research that examines the experience of nurses caring for these patients in the acute setting. A hermeneutic phenomenological approach was used to understand the experience of nurses caring for patients in the acute setting who had sustained a traumatic spinal injury with associated neurological deficit. Using the phenomenological approach guided by the insight of Gadamer and Max Van Manen , participants with a broad range of experience were recruited and interviewed. The responses were transcribed into a text and subjected to hermeneutic analysis. Burnard 's ( 1991) 14-step process and the hermeneutic approach were used to interpret and understand the phenomenon of interest. The study highlights the experience and challenges of providing care to these individuals. Although patients had significant physical disabilities and were often dependent physically , the nurses ' concerns were directed more towards fulfilling their psychological needs. Nurses identified grieving patients and felt their role was to provide realistic hope to motivate them. They felt an internal tension regarding desensitisation towards their patients , but this was often an internal protective mechanism to deal with the significance of the events surrounding these patients. Nurses new to this setting took time to learn the routines and manage the unique challenges effectively. Caring for these patients gave the nurses the opportunity to understand their patients and their families , and appreciate that both groups will fluctuate in their behavior throughout the acute process , as they adjust to grief and loss.
