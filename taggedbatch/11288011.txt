 Venous thromboembolism ( VTE) is considered a potentially serious complication of knee arthroscopy and leads to conditions such as deep venous thrombosis ( DVT) and pulmonary embolism ( PE). Low-molecular-weight heparin ( LMWH) is widely employed in knee arthroscopy to reduce perioperative thromboembolic complications. However , the efficacy and safety of LMWH in knee arthroscopy remains unclear. Seven randomized controlled clinical trials on LMWH in knee arthroscopy were identified and included in this meta-analysis. The main outcomes of the effectiveness ( prevention of DVT and PE) and complications ( death , major bleeding , and minor bleeding) of LMWH in knee arthroscopic surgery were assessed using Review Manager 5.3 software. The meta-analysis indicated that LMWH prophylaxis comprised 79 % of asymptomatic DVT. No association was found in symptomatic VTE ( RR: 0.90; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.39-2.08; P = 0.80) , symptomatic DVT ( RR: 0.79; 95 % CI: 0.28-2.23; P = 0.66) , symptomatic PE ( RR: 1.36; 95 % CI: 0.37-4.97; P = 0.64) and major bleeding ( RR: 0.70; 95 % CI: 0.12-3.95; P = 0.68) risk during LMWH prophylaxis were identified. Death was not reported in these studies. Moreover , there was a lower incidence of minor bleeding ( RR: 0.64; 95 % CI: 0.49 to 0.83; P = 0.001) in the control group than in the LMWH group. Compared with the control group , the group treated with LMWH after knee arthroscopy was no association in reducing the symptomatic VTE rate , symptomatic DVT rate or symptomatic PE rate. The symptomatic VTE rate was 0.5 % ( 11/2 ,166) in the LMWH group versus 0.6 % ( 10/1 ,713) in the control group. Although the limitations of this meta-analysis can not be ignored , the results of our study show that LMWH after knee arthroscopy is ineffective. We recommend that LMWH should not be routinely provided for knee arthroscopy. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03164746.
