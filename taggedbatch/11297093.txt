 Understanding of the land use and malaria<disease> transmission among farming communities in Tanzania is of great significance. Water resource development projects , deforestation , wetland cultivation , and land use changes for agricultural purposes all expand habitats for malaria-carrying mosquitoes. The main objective of this study was to assess land use patterns and their implication on malaria<disease> transmission in two villages in Kilosa District , Tanzania. Multiple research methods were used for data collection , including household interviews using a structured questionnaire; key informant interviews; transect walks and direct field observations. A larval search was conducted using the dipper standard method whereby mosquito larvae and pupae were identified to genus level. Data analysis was undertaken using the Stata software version 10 and descriptive statistics were used. A total of 211 diverse mosquito breeding habitats were surveyed during this study. The mosquito breeding sites ranged from small areas such as hoof prints and coconut shells to large ones such as swamps created through anthropogenic activities. The relationships between land use patterns and malaria<disease> transmission were statistically insignificant , indicating that malaria<disease> transmission in Kilosa could possibly be due to other human activities , including seasonal movement to distant farms during farming seasons. Communities were knowledgeable about malaria<disease> preventive measures such as the use of mosquito nets. While knowledge that links mosquitoes and malaria<disease> was relatively high among respondents , knowledge related to mosquito ecology and breeding sites was generally low. Although analysis of land use patterns did not show statistical significance in the study area , agricultural activities , brick making and settlement seem to be highly linked to malaria<disease> transmission. The association of land use patterns and malaria<disease> transmission is well observed in habitats created that harbour mosquitoes , and evidenced by presence of immature Anopheles<pathogen> mosquito larvae. Lack of knowledge of the epidemiology of transmission by the inhabitants is a major issue. Although it might be difficult to change land use patterns , as they are driven by economic necessity , future reduction of spread , through better education , is something that could be modified. In addition , more detailed studies are recommended to further confirm the linkages between land use/cover changes and malaria<disease> transmission in the study area.
