 This study evaluated the antimicrobial properties , cytotoxicity , and mineralization potential of methylcellulose hydrogels loaded with low concentrations of double antibiotic pastes ( DAP). The direct and residual antibacterial effects of 1 , 5 , and 10 mg/mL of DAP loaded into hydrogels as well as calcium hydroxide ( Ca ( OH) All tested concentrations of DAP hydrogels as well as Ca ( OH) Hydrogels containing 1 mg/mL DAP offered significant direct antibacterial effects against single- and dual-species biofilms without causing significant negative effects on viability , ALP activity , and mineralization nodule<disease> formation of DPSC. The methylcellulose-based hydrogel proposed in this study can be used clinically as a biocompatible system to deliver controlled low concentrations of DAP.
