 Tissue-resident memory T ( TRM) cells have emerged as a major component of T cell biology. Recent investigations have greatly advanced our understanding of TRMs. Common features have been discovered to distinguish memory T cells residing in various mucosal and non-mucosal tissues from their circulating counterparts. Given that most organs and tissues contain a unique microenvironment , local signal-induced tissue-specific features are tightly associated with the differentiation , homeostasis , and protective functions of TRMs. Here , we discuss recent advances in the TRM field with a special emphasis on the interaction between local signals and TRMs in the context of individual tissue environment.
