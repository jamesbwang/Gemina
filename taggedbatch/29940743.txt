 Blood gas analysis is very important in the patients with respiratory problems. Arterial puncture may cause complications such as pain , local hematoma , infection and nerve injury. The procedure itself can be technically difficult. In contrast , venous sampling is an easier procedure with fewer complications. Therefore , this study aims to determine the possibility of replacement of venous blood gas ( VBG) values by ABG values in ICU wards admitted patients. In this study , 155 paired blood gas samples collected from patients admitted to ICU wards in Motahari hospital , Marvdasht , Fars , Iran. Statistical means of blood gas parameters , including PO2 , PCO2 , HCO3 and PH have been compared in both , arterial and venous , blood samples in parallel using paired t-test. Mean difference of arterial and venous gas parameters , PO2 , PCO2 and HCO3 , was significantly differ. All paired gas parameters in arterial and venous blood samples were significantly correlated , while this correlation was stronger between PCO2 and HCO3. To predict the arterial blood gas parameters from VBG parameters , single regression models are of more statistical value compared to multiple regression models. Defined single regression prediction models could be used to predict arterial PCO2 and HCO3 , which may reduce arterial sampling in ICU wards.
