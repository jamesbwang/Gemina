 We propose a general high-throughput virtual screening approach for the optical and electronic properties of conjugated polymers. This approach makes use of the recently developed xTB family of low-computational-cost density functional tight-binding methods from Grimme and co-workers , calibrated here to ( Time-Dependent) Density Functional Theory ( ( TD) DFT) data computed for a representative diverse set of ( co) polymers. Parameters drawn from the resulting calibration using a linear model can then be applied to the xTB derived results for new polymers , thus generating near DFT-quality data with orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost. As a result , after an initial computational investment for calibration , this approach can be used to quickly and accurately screen on the order of thousands of polymers for target applications. We also demonstrate that the ( opto) electronic properties of the conjugated polymers show only a very minor variation when considering different conformers and that the results of high-throughput screening are therefore expected to be relatively insensitive with respect to the conformer search methodology applied.
