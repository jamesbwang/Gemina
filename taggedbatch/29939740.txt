 The glycosylation of plant polyphenols may modulate their solubility and bioavailability and protect these molecules from oxygen , light degradation , and during gastrointestinal transit. In this work , the synthesis of various α-glucosyl derivatives of (-)- epigallocatechin gallate , the predominant catechin in green tea , was performed in water at 50 °C by a transglycosylation reaction catalyzed by cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase from Thermoanaerobacter sp.. The molecular weight of reaction products was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Using hydrolyzed potato starch as a glucosyl donor , two main monoglucosides were obtained with conversion yields of 58 and 13 % , respectively. The products were isolated and chemically characterized by combining two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance methods. The major derivative was epigallocatechin gallate 3 '- O-α-d-glucopyranoside ( 1) , and the minor derivative was epigallocatechin gallate 7- O-α-d-glucopyranoside ( 2).
