 Assessment of support needs has received significant attention in the disability field , however , little is known about the stability of support needs scores over time. Data from 82 adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities ( IDD) who were reassessed with the Supports Intensity Scale-Adult ( SIS-A) version as well as the SIS-A Annual Review Protocol ( SIS-A ARP) were analyzed. The findings suggest stability of SIS-A scores over a one- to three-year period in adults with IDD. Several sections of the SIS-A ARP showed discriminative power , particularly sections that asked if there had been changes in a subset of specific life activities assessed on the SIS-A and in medical and behavioral needs. Implications for further research and practice are discussed.
