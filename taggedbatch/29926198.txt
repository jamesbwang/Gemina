 In this article , an attempt for efficient screening of circulating tumor cells ( CTCs) with excellent operability on microfluidic chips was reported. A Parsortix ™- like cell separation chip was manufactured in our lab. This chip allowed lateral flow of fluid which increased the flow rate of blood. And , an air valve controlled injection pump was manufactured which allowed eight chips working simultaneously. This greatly facilitated the blood treatment process and saved time. As for the mechanism of screening circulating tumor cells , selective size amplification was utilized. By size amplification of cancer cells , both the hardness and the size of CTCs increased which differentiated them from blood cells. And the modification procedure of beads used for size amplification of cancer cells was optimized. Finally , by integrating the commercialized Parsortix ™- like cell separation chip and selective size amplification , a practical method for screening circulating tumor cells was established.
