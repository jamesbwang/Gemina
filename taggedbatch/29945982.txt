 The bile acid receptors , farnesoid X receptor ( FXR) and Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 ( TGR5) , regulate multiple pathways , including glucose and lipid metabolism. In a rabbit model of high-fat diet ( HFD)- induced metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> , long-term treatment with the dual FXR/TGR5 agonist INT-767 reduces visceral adipose tissue accumulation , hypercholesterolemia and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. INT-767 significantly improves the hallmarks of insulin resistance in visceral adipose tissue ( VAT) and induces mitochondrial and brown fat-specific markers. VAT preadipocytes isolated from INT-767-treated rabbits , compared to preadipocytes from HFD , show increased mRNA expression of brown adipogenesis markers. In addition , INT-767 induces improved mitochondrial ultrastructure and dynamic , reduced superoxide production and improved insulin signaling and lipid handling in preadipocytes. Both
