 An innovative core-shell nanocarrier , combining the magnetism of surface active maghemite nanoparticles ( SAMNs , the core) and tannic acid ( TA , the shell) was self-assembled by simple incubation in water. Due to the drastic reorganization of SAMN surface , the prepared magnetic nanocarrier ( SAMN@TA) resulted as one of the most robust nanomaterial bearing TA to date. Nevertheless , the ferric tannates network , constituting the SAMN@TA shell , and the free tannic acid display comparable chemical behavior. The antimicrobial properties of SAMN@TA were tested on Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> in comparison with free TA , showing similar bacteriostatic effects at relatively low concentrations. Besides the preservation of the TA inhibitory activity toward L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> , the possibility of being magnetically removed leaving no residues into the matrix makes this nanocarrier an innovative processing aid for surface treatments. Thus , SAMN@TA can be used as an effective , low-cost and environmentally friendly antimicrobial nanomaterial for the food industry applications.
