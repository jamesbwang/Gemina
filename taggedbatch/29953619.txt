 The microbiome and its cross-talk with the brain have drawn increasing attention lately , since imbalances in the gut microbiota 's composition may result in pathogenic dysfunctions affecting brain functioning up to development of neurodegenerative and mental diseases. The current Editorial discusses a study by Gao and coworkers in the current issue of the Journal of Neurochemistry in which the authors use a model of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis- targeted infusion of antibiotics into the gut- to assess if microbiotic metabolites exert effects on local neurotransmitter expression or contribute to the gut-brain axis. The authors mechanistically link distal ileal infusion of antibiotics with a change in the levels of microbial metabolites that affect the expression of neurotransmitters in the brain and thereby can participate in the fine-tuning of the hypothalamic functions , including regulation of visceral and neuroendocrine processes , stress responses , mood and anxiety<symptom>. Their study thus represents an important step towards our understanding of the brain-gut axis , with the potential to advance therapeutics.
