 Hypertrophic scars formed after burns remain a challenge in clinical practice. Development of effective scar therapies relies on validated animal models that mimic human hypertrophic scars. A consistent porcine full-thickness burn hypertrophic scar model has yet to be developed. We have previously reported that Shikonin induces apoptosis and reduces collagen production in hypertrophic scar fibroblasts
