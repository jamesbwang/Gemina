 Interindividual variation in fecundities has major consequences on population evolutionary potential , through genetic drift and selection. Using two spatially explicit mating models that analyse the genotypes of seeds and seedlings , we investigated the variation of male and female fecundities within and among three European beech ( Fagus sylvatica) stands situated along an altitudinal gradient. Female and male individual fecundity distributions were both skewed in this monoecious species , and we found a higher variance in female as compared to male fecundities. Both female and male fecundities increased with tree size and decreased with density and competition in the neighbourhood , the details of these effects suggesting sex-specific strategies to deal with the impact of limited resource on fecundity. The studied populations were functionally male-biased. Among-individual variations in functional gender were not driven by tree size but by density and competition in the neighbourhood. Femaleness decreased under limited resource availability , an expected consequence of the higher cost of female reproduction. Considering the variation of gene flow and genetic drift across elevation , our results suggest that the adaptive potential could be enhanced by low genetic drift at low elevation , and by high pollen-mediated gene flow at high elevation. Finally , this study predicts a more efficient response to selection for traits related to male vs. female fitness , for a given selection intensity.
