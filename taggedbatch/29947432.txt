 Analysis of the bacterial community dynamics during the production of traditional fermented condiments is important for food safety assessment , quality control and development of starter culture technology. In this study , bacteria isolated during the processing of iru and ogiri , two commonly consumed condiments in Nigeria , were characterised based on phylogenetic analyses of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. A total of 227 isolates were obtained and clustered into 12 operational taxonomic units ( OTUs) based on 97 % 16S rRNA gene similarity. The OTUs spanned three phyla ( Firmicutes , Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria) , and nine genera: Acinetobacter<pathogen> , Aerococcus<pathogen> , Bacillus , Enterococcus<pathogen> , Enterobacter<pathogen> , Lysinibacillus , Micrococcus<pathogen> , Proteus<pathogen> and Staphylococcus<pathogen>. OTUs closely related to species of Bacillus<pathogen> dominated the processing stages of both condiments. Although no single OTU occurred throughout iru processing stages , an OTU ( mostly related to B. safensis) dominated the ogiri processing stages indicating potentials for the development of starter culture. However , other isolates such as those of Enterococcus<pathogen> spp. and Lysinibacillus spp. may be potential starters for iru fermentation. Presumptive foodborne pathogens were also detected at some stages of the condiments ' processing , possibly due to poor hygienic practices. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
