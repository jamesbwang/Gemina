 Women with overweight experience stigma in clinical interactions. Emerging evidence suggests that one near-term approach to offset the negative consequences of weight stigma could be to capitalize on benefits of patient-physician weight concordance. However , it is likely that patient attitudes towards physicians with overweight are complicated and multifaceted and may include stigmatization of providers with overweight. Two-hundred ninety-eight women with overweight completed an online questionnaire and indicated preference for a physician who is ` overweight ' , ` not overweight ' , or indicated no preference. Participants provided reasons for their choice and answered questions about their weight-related beliefs and experiences. The majority of women indicated no weight preference ( 63 %) , and a portion ( 36 %) of the sample explicitly preferred physicians who are not overweight. Reasons provided for these preferences were primarily based on stereotyped notions of physician aptitude based on weight. Compared with having no preference , those who preferred physicians who are not overweight had fewer previous negative weight-related physician interactions and had increased beliefs about the controllability of weight. These findings elucidate patient attitudes towards physicians with overweight in a sample at increased risk for weight stigmatization. Findings underscore the need for stigma-reducing interventions so that clinical experiences for both women and physicians with overweight can be improved.
