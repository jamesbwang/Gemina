 Headache<symptom> in patients with calcified neurocysticercosis ( NCC) is probably common but has been largely overlooked. We aimed to assess the presence , characteristics , and diagnosis of headache<symptom> across patients with calcified NCC and their matched controls. In this case-control study nested to a population-based cohort , Atahualpa residents aged â‰¥ 20 years with calcified NCC were identified as case patients and paired 1:1 to age- and gender-matched randomly selected controls. A culturally adapted questionnaire was derived from the EUROLIGHT. Headache<symptom> diagnosis was established according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders , 3rd edition. Conditional logistic regression models for matched paired data were fitted to assess the independent association between calcified NCC ( as the exposure) and headache<symptom> variables , after adjusting for education , alcohol intake , depression<symptom> , and epilepsy. The selection process generated 106 case patients and their matched controls. Lifetime headache<symptom> prevalence ( OR: 4.18; 95 % Confidence Interval ( CI): 1.79-9.75;
