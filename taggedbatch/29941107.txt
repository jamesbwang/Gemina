 Ultrasound is the second most utilized imaging modality in the world because it is widely accessible , robust , and safe. Aside from its extensive use in diagnostic imaging , ultrasound has also been frequently utilized in therapeutic applications. Particularly , when combined with appropriate delivery systems , ultrasound provides a flexible platform for simultaneous real-time imaging and triggered release , enabling precise , on-demand drug delivery to target sites. This chapter will discuss the basics of ultrasound including its mechanism of action and how it can be used to trigger the release of encapsulated drug either through thermal or cavitation effects. Fundamentals of ultrasound contrast agents , how they enhance ultrasound signals , and how they can be modified to function as carriers for triggered and targeted release of drugs will also be discussed.
