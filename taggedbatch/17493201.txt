 With the rapid increase in the number of Korean older adults , developing and integrating quality , expert older adult care in the Korean health care system will be essential and a tremendous benefit to these older adult patients , their families , and Korean society. While the awareness of geriatric medicine as a specialty for physicians caring exclusively for older adults has improved greatly in recent decades among Korean health care providers and older adult patients , there is still great opportunity to improve training opportunities for all medical students , primary care physicians , and specialty Geriatrics. Korea must also formally establish uniform geriatric medicine fellowships and certification. However , a number of barriers such as insufficient expertise , low incentives , and competitive geriatric societies exist to implement widespread , quality geriatric medicine in the Korean health care system.
