 Breast compression is used in mammography to improve image quality and reduce radiation dose. However , optimal values for compression force are not known , and studies have found large variation in use of compression forces between breast centres and radiographers. We investigated breast compression parameters , including compression force , compression pressure and compressed breast thickness across four consecutive full field digital mammography screening examinations for 25,143 subsequently screened females aged 50-69 years. Methods: Information from females attending four consecutive screening examinations at two breast centres in BreastScreen Norway during January 2007- March 2016 was available. We compared the changes in compression force , compression pressure and compressed breast thickness from the first to fourth consecutive screening examination , stratified by craniocaudal ( CC) and mediolateral oblique ( MLO) view. Results: Compression force , compression pressure and compressed breast thickness increased relatively by 18.3 , 14.4 and 8.4 % respectively , from first to fourth consecutive screening examination in CC view ( p < 0.001 for all). For MLO view , the values increased relatively by 12.3 % for compression force , 9.9 % for compression pressure and 6.9 % for compressed breast thickness from first to fourth consecutive screening examination ( p < 0.001 for all). Conclusion: We observed increasing values of breast compression parameters across consecutive screening examinations. Further research should investigate the effect of this variation on image quality and females ' experiences of discomfort and pain. Advances in knowledge: Breast compression force , compression pressure and compressed breast thickness increased across consecutive screening examinations , which might be of influence for the females ' experiences of discomfort and pain during the examination and for image quality.
