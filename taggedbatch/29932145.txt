 The geostationary remote sensing satellite has the capability of wide scanning , persistent observation and operational response , and has tremendous potential for maritime target surveillance. The GF-4 satellite is the first geostationary orbit ( GEO) optical remote sensing satellite with medium resolution in China. In this paper , a novel ship-tracking method in GF-4 satellite sequential imagery is proposed. The algorithm has three stages. First , a local visual saliency map based on local peak signal-to-noise ratio ( PSNR) is used to detect ships in a single frame of GF-4 satellite sequential images. Second , the accuracy positioning of each potential target is realized by a dynamic correction using the rational polynomial coefficients ( RPCs) and automatic identification system ( AIS) data of ships. Finally , an improved multiple hypotheses tracking ( MHT) algorithm with amplitude information is used to track ships by further removing the false targets , and to estimate ships & rsquo; motion parameters. The algorithm has been tested using GF-4 sequential images and AIS data. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the algorithm achieves good tracking performance in GF-4 satellite sequential images and estimates the motion information of ships accurately.
