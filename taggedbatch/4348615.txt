 The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of lipid-coated ZnO ( LCZ) and the level of LCZ compared with ordinary zinc oxide ( ZnO) on antioxidant defense system in the intestine and liver of piglets. A total of forty piglets ( n = 8) were fed a diet supplemented with 100 ppm Zn with ZnO ( ZnO-1) , 2,500 ppm Zn with ZnO ( ZnO-2) , 100 ppm Zn as LCZ ( LCZ-1) , 200 ppm Zn as LCZ ( LCZ-2) , or 400 ppm Zn as LCZ ( LCZ-3) for 14-d , respectively. The LCZ-3 group resulted in higher (
