 The existence of a blood group preference for ticks is a problem widely discussed among the lay public but often neglected by the scientific community. The <i> Ixodes ricinus<pathogen> </i> tick transmits serious zoonotic diseases such as Lyme<disease> borreliosis , tick encephalitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> , or anaplasmosis<disease>. The preventive strategies include vaccination ( if available) and individual measures including the use of repellents and avoidance of risk areas. Since this topic is relatively neglected in the scientific literature , a simple <i> in vitro </i> method was used. Ticks used in this study were collected in the suburban region of Ruda in Brno , Czech Republic. One hundred active nymphs of the collected ticks were tested for preferences for blood groups , using Petri dishes and blood samples from volunteers. To demonstrate the threat of ticks and the diseases they transmit , the positivity of one of the most abundant zoonosis , Lyme<disease> borreliosis , was tested using dark-field microscopy. The results obtained showed that the examined ticks were attracted most by blood group A , whereas the least preferred was group B , which was proved statistically ( p < 0.05). The mean positivity of collected ticks for the presence of spirochaetes was 9.35 %. The results indicate that the host selection of ticks may be influenced by the physiological or biochemical profile of an individual , such as their blood group. This means that a blood group of an individual can be one of the factors that increase the risk of tick bite and the transmission of dangerous diseases and thus must not be underestimated.
