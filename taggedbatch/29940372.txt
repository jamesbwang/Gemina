 This literature study paper will present the possibility of a correlation between the Energy Meridians of Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM) , which can be traced back to the recently described Primo Vessels ( formerly known as Bong-Han ducts) , their composition and the ability of tumours to proliferate and metastasise. It is proposed that microvesicular bodies such as exosomes , known to be involved in cell-to-cell communication , immune response and tumour proliferation , could be moving across the body via the Primo Vascular System. The ubiquity of the Primo Vascular System and its penetration through the blood-brain barrier could also explain the ability of some peripheral tumours ( e.g. breast tumour) to metastasise in the brain.
