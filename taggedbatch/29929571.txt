 Phenoloxidase ( PO) plays a key role in melanin biosynthesis during insect development. Here , we isolated the 2310-bp full-length cDNA of PPO1 from Zeugodacus tau , a destructive horticultural pest. qRT-polymerase chain reaction showed that the ZtPPO1 transcripts were highly expressed during larval-prepupal transition and in the haemolymph. When the larvae were fed a 1.66 % kojic acid ( KA)- containing diet , the levels of the ZtPPO1 transcripts significantly increased by 2.79- and 3.39-fold in the whole larvae and cuticles , respectively , while the corresponding PO activity was significantly reduced; in addition , the larval and pupal durations were significantly prolonged; pupal weights were lowered; and abnormal phenotypes were observed. An in vitro inhibition experiment indicated that KA was an effective competitive inhibitor of PO in Z. tau. Additionally , the functional analysis showed that 20E could significantly up-regulate the expression of ZtPPO1 , induce lower pupal weight , and advance pupation. Knockdown of the ZtPPO1 gene by RNAi significantly decreased mRNA levels after 24 h and led to low pupation rates and incomplete pupae with abnormal phenotypes during the larval-pupal interim period. These results proved that PO is important for the normal growth of Z. tau and that KA can disrupt the development of this pest insect.
