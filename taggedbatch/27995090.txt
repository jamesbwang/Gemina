 In colorectal cancer ( CRC) , the liver is the most common site of metastasis. Surgical resection represents the standard therapy for patients with colorectal liver metastases ( CRLM). However , 5-year survival rates after resection do not exceed 50 % , and despite existing preoperative stratification algorithms it is still debated which patients benefit most from surgical treatment. The soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ( suPAR) has recently evolved as a promising biomarker for distinct clinical conditions. Here , we examined a potential role of suPAR as a biomarker in patients undergoing resection of CRLM. Correlating with upregulated uPAR tissue expression in resected metastases , serum concentrations of suPAR were significantly elevated in CRLM patients compared to healthy controls. Importantly , patients with preoperative suPAR serum levels above the identified ideal cut-off value of 4.83 ng/ml showed a significantly reduced overall survival after resection of CRLM , both in right- and left-sided primary CRC. Moreover , multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed preoperative suPAR serum levels as a prognostic factor for mortality. Additionally , elevated preoperative suPAR but not creatinine levels were a predictor of acute kidney injury ( AKI) after CRLM resection , correlating with a longer postoperative hospitalization. SuPAR represents a promising novel biomarker in CRLM patients that might help to guide preoperative treatment decisions regarding patients ' outcome and to identify patients particularly susceptible to AKI. Expression levels of uPAR were analyzed in CRLM tissue using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. SuPAR serum levels were measured by ELISA in 104 CRC patients undergoing hepatic resection for CRLM and 50 healthy controls.
