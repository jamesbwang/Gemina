 The development of non-fullerene acceptor molecules have remarkably boosted power conversion efficiency ( PCE) of polymer solar cells ( PSCs) due to the improved spectral coverage and reduced energy loss. An introduction of fullerene molecules into the non-fullerene acceptor-based blend may further improve the photovoltaic performance of the resultant ternary PSCs. However , the underlying mechanism is still debatable. Herein , the ternary PSCs based on PBDB-T: ITIC: PC
