 Chronic hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection is common among people who inject drugs ( PWID) and is associated with morbidity and premature death. Although HCV<pathogen> can be cured , treatment may be inaccessible. We studied HCV<pathogen> testing , status and treatment among marginalized people who use drugs in Ottawa , Canada , a setting with universal insurance coverage for physician services. We analyzed data from the Participatory Research in Ottawa: Understanding Drugs study , a cross-sectional , peer-administered survey of people who use drugs from 2012 to 2013. We linked responses to population-based health administrative databases and used multivariable Poisson regression to identify factors independently associated with self-reported HCV<pathogen> testing , self-reported positive HCV<pathogen> status , and database-determined engagement in HCV<pathogen> treatment. Among 663 participants , 562 ( 84.8 %) reported testing for HCV<pathogen> and 258 ( 45.9 %) reported HCV-positive status. In multivariable analysis , HCV-positive status was associated with female gender ( RR 1.27; 95 % CI 1.04 to 1.55) , advancing age ( RR 1.03/ year; 95 % CI 1.02 to 1.04) , receiving disability payments ( RR 1.42; 95 % CI 1.06 to 1.91) , injecting drugs ( RR 5.11; 95 % CI 2.64 to 9.91) , ever injecting with a used needle ( RR 1.30; 95 % CI 1.12 to 1.52) , and ever having taken methadone ( RR 1.26; 95 % CI 1.05 to 1.52). Of HCV<pathogen> positive participants , 196 ( 76 %) were engaged in primary care but only 23 ( 8.9 %) had received HCV<pathogen> therapy. Conclusions/Importance: Although HCV<pathogen> testing and positive status rates are high among PWID in our study , few have received HCV<pathogen> treatment. Innovative initiatives to increase access to HCV<pathogen> treatment for PWID are urgently needed.
