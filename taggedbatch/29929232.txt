 Quantifying operator exposure to pesticides is a key component of the decision-making procedure for risk assessment. China is the largest cotton-planting country in the world. Dense cotton planting patterns and pesticide overuse potentially place Chinese cotton farmers at high levels of exposure risk. Using whole-body dosimetry during backpack spraying application in cotton filed , the present study monitored potential dermal and inhalation exposure to the insecticide imidacloprid. For forward spraying ( when the operators walked forward) , the total potential dermal and inhalation exposure was 2059mg/kg of active ingredient ( ai) , corresponding to 0.21 % of the applied quantity of the insecticide. However , the total exposure of backward walking ( 188mg/kg of ai) was approximately 11 times lower than that of forward walking. The upper body parts ( head , chest , back and arms) were the most exposed. The potential inhalation exposure contributed to < 0.1 % of the total exposure. The exposure risk to imidacloprid inherent in these agricultural procedures was evaluated by margin of exposure values and was found to be safe under the present cotton treatment scenarios. In general , similar body exposure and distribution between Allura Red and imidacloprid verify Allura Red 's feasibility as an environmentally friendly pesticide surrogate for exposure assessment.
