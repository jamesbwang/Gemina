 Despite the abundance of plants that benefit from fire in Mediterranean ecosystems , little is known about the possible presence of fire-favoured insects ( other than bark beetles). For two years we sampled invertebrates after two large wildfires in eastern Spain and demonstrate that two flower beetle species , Protaetia morio and P. oblonga ( Cetoniidae) , show a pyrophilous behaviour. These beetles were much more numerous after the fires than in unburnt plots around the fire perimeter; in addition , these species tended to increase in number with the distance from the fire perimeter and with fire recurrence , especially P. morio. These results were maintained for the two postfire years sampled. The results for the beetles do not support the hypothesis of postfire colonization , but that local populations survived the fire as eggs or larvae protected in the soil ( endogenous persistence). We propose that the increase in population size ( compared with unburnt zones) could be driven by the reduction of their predator populations , as vertebrates that feed on these beetles were disfavoured by fire. That is , the results suggest that these flower beetle species benefit from fire because fire disrupts antagonistic interactions with their predators ( predation release hypothesis). Given the omnipresence of small mammals , soil insects , and fires , the processes described here are likely to be general but unexplored.
