 We developed and validated a tool assessing the adherence to the Mediterranean diet based on current nutritional recommendations for health promotion ( MEDI-Quest). Four-hundred-and-eleven clinically healthy subjects completed both the MEDI-Quest-score and the validated MedDietScore ( MDS). A good accordance between MEDI-Quest and MDS was observed ( R = 0.638) , as well as for the percentage of individuals having similar scores with both methods for each food group. Regarding socio-cultural-factors , higher adherence was observed in people with older-age ( OR = 1.030 , p < .0001) , more qualifier-employment ( OR = 1.136 , p < .005) , higher-income ( OR = 1.925 , p < .0001) , interest in reading-food-labels ( OR = 2.057 , p < .0001) , and having frequent physical activity ( OR = 1.608 , p < .05). In conclusion , our findings show that ( 1) the MEDI-Quest score well correlate with MDS , and ( 2) the adherence to the Mediterranean diet is not particularly high due to less cultural roots. It could be necessary to improve people 's knowledge about food and nutrition , taking into consideration believes embedded in their family , tradition and religion.
