 A key adaptation of mammals to their environment is their ability to maintain a constant high body temperature , even at rest , under a wide range of ambient temperatures. In cold climates , this is achieved by an adaptive production of endogenous heat , known as nonshivering thermogenesis ( NST) , in the brown adipose tissue ( BAT). This organ , unique to mammals , contains a very high density of mitochondria , and BAT correct functioning relies on the correct functioning of its mitochondria. Mitochondria enclose proteins encoded both in the maternally inherited mitochondrial genome and in the biparentally inherited nuclear genome , and one overlooked hypothesis is that both genomes and their interaction may shape NST. By housing under standardised conditions wild-derived common voles ( Microtus<pathogen> arvalis) from two distinct evolutionary lineages ( Western and Central) , we show that Western voles had greater NST than Central voles. By introgressing those two lineages over at least 9 generations , we then experimentally tested the influence of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes on NST and related phenotypic traits. We found that between-lineage variation in NST and BAT size were significantly influenced by the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes , respectively , with the Western mitochondrial genotype being associated with higher NST and the Western nuclear genotype with a larger BAT. There were significant mito-nuclear interactions on whole animal body<symptom> weight and resting metabolic rate. Hybrid voles were lighter and had higher resting metabolic rate. Overall , our findings turn new light on the influence of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes on thermogenesis and building adaptation to the environment in mammals.
