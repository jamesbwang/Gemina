 Germ line DICER1 mutations predispose to a syndrome<disease><symptom> associated with increased risk of e.g. multinodular goitre ( MNG) , pleuropulmonary blastoma and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour ( SLCT). This is a case report about a family with a nonsense DICER1 mutation , c. 988C > T , affecting six family members. The proband had once undergone a unilateral oophorectomy and a thyroidectomy due to SLCT and MNG , respectively. The proband has two children with the mutation but with no manifestations. Given this circumstance , we discuss the prospects of an implementation of screening programmes for children with predisposed cancerous syndromes<disease><symptom>.
