 MyD88 is a cytoplasmic adaptor protein that plays a central role in signaling downstream of the TLRs and the IL1R superfamily. We previously demonstrated that MyD88 plays a critical role in EAE , the murine model of multiple sclerosis , and showed that the MyD88 BB-loop decoy peptide RDVLPGT ameliorates EAE. We now designed and screened a library of backbone cyclized peptides based on the linear BB loop peptide , to identify a metabolically stable inhibitor of MyD88 that retains the binding properties of the linear peptide. We identified a novel cyclic peptide protein mimetic that inhibits inflammatory responses to TLR ligands , and NFÎºB activation in response to IL-1 activation. The inhibitor , c ( MyD 4-4) , is metabolically stable in comparison to the linear peptide , blocks MyD88 in a specific manner , and inhibits MyD88 function by preventing MyD88 dimerization. Finally , treatment of mice with c ( MyD 4-4) reduced the severity of clinical disease in the murine EAE model of multiple sclerosis. Thus , modulation of MyD88-dependent signaling using c ( MyD 4-4) is a potential therapeutic strategy to lower innate immune inflammation<symptom> in autoimmune CNS disease.
