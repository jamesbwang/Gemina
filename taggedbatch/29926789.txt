 Prior studies have found associations between visual acuity ( VA) and cognitive function. However , these studies used a limited range of cognitive measures and did not control for cardiovascular disease risk factors ( CVD-RFs) and baseline function. The primary objective of this study was to analyze the associations of VA and cognitive performance using a thorough neuropsychological test battery. This study used community-dwelling sample data across the sixth ( 2001-2006) and seventh ( 2006-2010) waves of the Maine-Syracuse Longitudinal Study ( n = 655). Wave 6 VA as measured by the Snellen Eye Test was the primary predictor of wave 6 and wave 7 Global cognitive performance , Visual-Spatial Organization and Memory , Verbal Episodic Memory , Working Memory , Scanning and Tracking , and Executive Function. Additionally , VA was used to predict longitudinal changes in wave 7 cognitive performance ( wave 6 performance adjusted). We analyzed these relationships with multiple linear and logistic regression models adjusted for age , sex , education , ethnicity , depressive symptoms , physical function deficits in addition to CVD-RFs , chronic kidney disease , homocysteine , continuous systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and hypertension status. Adjusted for demographic covariates and CVD-RFs , poorer VA was associated with concurrent and approximate 5-year declines in Global cognitive function , Visual-Spatial Organization and Memory , and Verbal Episodic Memory. VA may be used in combination with other screening measures to determine risk for cognitive decline. ( JINS , 2018 , 24 , 1-9).
