 Psychosocial protective factors include dispositional and family attributes that may reduce the occurrence of dental<disease> caries<disease>. This review analysed the evidence on the relationship between protective psychosocial factors and dental<disease> caries<disease> in children and adolescents. Primary studies involving children and adolescents were searched in the following electronic databases: Medline , SCOPUS , LILACS , SciELO , and Web of Science. The reference lists were also screened. Protective psychosocial factor descriptors were in accordance with the salutogenic theory. The outcome was clinical measure of dental<disease> caries<disease>. Quality assessments were performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The final search resulted in 35 studies , including 7 cohort , one case-control , and 27 cross-sectional studies. Most studies were of moderate quality. Meta-analyses revealed that low parental internal locus of control ( cohort studies: OR = 1.42 , 95 % CI: 1.20-1.64; cross-sectional studies: OR = 1.30 , 95 % CI: 1.19-1.41) , high parental external chance ( OR = 1.20 , 95 % CI: 1.10-1.29) , and high maternal sense of coherence ( OR = 0.77 , 95 % CI: 0.62-0.93) were associated with dental<disease> caries<disease> in children. High social support ( OR = 0.81 , 95 % CI: 0.68-0.93) and greater self-efficacy ( OR = 1.50 , 95 % CI: 1.12-1.22) were also associated with dental<disease> caries<disease> in adolescents. The current evidence suggests that some salutogenic factors are important protective factors of dental<disease> caries<disease> during childhood and adolescence.
