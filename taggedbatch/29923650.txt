 L-dopa induced dyskinesias ( LIDs) are a disabling motor complication of L-dopa therapy for Parkinson 's disease ( PD) management. Treatment options remain limited and the underlying network mechanisms remain unclear due to a complex pathophysiology. What is well-known , however , is that aberrant striatal signaling plays a key role in LIDs development. Here , we discuss the specific contribution of striatal cholinergic interneurons ( ChIs) and GABAergic medium spiny projection neurons ( MSNs) with a particular focus on how cholinergic signaling may integrate multiple striatal systems to modulate LIDs expression. Enhanced ChI transmission , altered MSN activity and the associated abnormal downstream signaling responses that arise with nigrostriatal damage are well known to contribute to LIDs development. In fact , enhancing M4 muscarinic receptor activity , a receptor favorably expressed on D1 dopamine receptor-expressing MSNs dampens their activity to attenuate LIDs. Likewise , ChI activation via thalamostriatal neurons is shown to interrupt cortical signaling to enhance D2 dopamine receptor-expressing MSN activity via M1 muscarinic receptors , which may interrupt ongoing motor activity. Notably , numerous preclinical studies also show that reducing nicotinic cholinergic receptor activity decreases LIDs. Taken together , these studies indicate the importance of cholinergic control of striatal neuronal activity and point to muscarinic and nicotinic receptors as significant pharmacological targets for alleviating LIDs in PD patients.
