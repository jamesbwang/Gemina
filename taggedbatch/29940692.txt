 Ultrasonography is highly sensitive for the diagnosis of sialoliths. Recently , wireless mobile ultrasonography was developed. We describe the case of a 49-year-old man who presented with painful postprandial left cheek swelling. Computed tomography detected a solitary 5-mm parotid<symptom> duct stone with infection at the anterior portion of the left masseter muscle. Transoral stone removal was planned , although difficulty was expected in view of the surrounding infection. Surgery was performed under the guidance of mobile ultrasonography , and the stone was removed safely.
