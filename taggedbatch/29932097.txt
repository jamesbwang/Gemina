 Asphalt pavement is widely used for expressways due to its advantages of flexibility , low cost , and easy maintenance. However , pavement failures , including cracking , raveling , and potholes , will appear after long-term service. This research evaluated the residual fatigue<symptom> properties of asphalt pavement after long-term field service. Fatigue<symptom> behavior<symptom> of specimens with different pavement failure types , traffic load , service time , and layers were collected and characterized. Results indicate that after long-term field service , surface layer has a longer fatigue<symptom> life under small stress levels , but shorter fatigue<symptom> life under large stress levels. Longer service time results in greater sensitivity to loading stress , while heavier traffic results in shorter fatigue<symptom> life. Surface and underneath layers present very close fatigue<symptom> trend lines in some areas , indicating that the fatigue<symptom> behavior<symptom> of asphalt mixture in surface and underneath layers are aged to the same extent after eight to ten years of field service.
