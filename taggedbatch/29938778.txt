 Phosphatidylserine ( PS) exposure increases as red cells age , and is an important signal for the removal of senescent cells from the circulation. PS exposure is elevated in red cells from sickle cell anaemia ( SCA) patients and is thought to enhance haemolysis and vaso-occlusion. Although precise conditions leading to its externalisation are unclear , high intracellular Ca
