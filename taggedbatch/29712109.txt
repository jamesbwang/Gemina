 This work describes a nanohybrid material consisting of gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs) and nanosheets of layered double hydroxides ( NLDHs) of Mg ( II) and Al ( III). Mono-disperse AuNPs were immobilized on the surface of the LDHs via Au-O bonding. The nanohybrid sorbent was packed in an organic filter along with a syringe and applied to the microextraction of triazine herbicides with the help of an injection pump. The collected hexane eluate was concentrated and directly injected into a HPLC column for quantification. The effects of the amount of Au/LDH nanohydrobrids , type , flow rate , volume of washing and eluting solvent were optimized. The method was validated by detecting four triazine herbicides ( prometryn , atrazine , terbumeton and secbumeton) in spiked maize. The limits of detection range between 35 and 108 pg g
