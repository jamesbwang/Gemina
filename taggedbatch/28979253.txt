 The coinage `` pan-genome '' was first introduced dating back to 2005 , and was used to elaborate the entire gene repertoire of any given species. Core genome consists of genes shared by all bacterial strains studied and is considered to encode essential functions associated with species ' basic biology and phenotypes , yet its relatedness with bacterial lifestyle of the species remains elusive. We performed the pan-genome analysis of sulfur-oxidizing acidophile
