 Liver damage is typically inferred from serum measurements of cytoplasmic liver enzymes. DNA molecules released from dying hepatocytes are an alternative biomarker , unexplored so far , potentially allowing for quantitative assessment of liver cell death. Here we describe a method for detecting acute hepatocyte death , based on quantification of circulating , cell-free DNA ( cfDNA) fragments carrying hepatocyte-specific methylation patterns. We identified 3 genomic loci that are unmethylated specifically in hepatocytes , and used bisulfite conversion , PCR , and massively parallel sequencing to quantify the concentration of hepatocyte-derived DNA in mixed samples. Healthy donors had , on average , 30 hepatocyte genomes/ml plasma , reflective of basal cell turnover in the liver. We identified elevations of hepatocyte cfDNA in patients shortly after liver transplantation , during acute rejection of an established liver transplant , and also in healthy individuals after partial hepatectomy. Furthermore , patients with sepsis<disease> had high levels of hepatocyte cfDNA , which correlated with levels of liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT). Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients , in which elevated AST and ALT derive from damaged muscle rather than liver , did not have elevated hepatocyte cfDNA. We conclude that measurements of hepatocyte-derived cfDNA can provide specific and sensitive information on hepatocyte death , for monitoring human liver dynamics , disease , and toxicity.
