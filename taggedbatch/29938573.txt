 Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease , and stratification of patients is fundamental to the success of treatment modalities. Breast tumors deficient in BRCA1 are mostly associated with basal-like breast cancers and targeted therapeutics for this disease subtype are still lacking. In order to address whether macroautophagy/autophagy inhibition will be effective in BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors , we generated mice with conditional deletion of an essential autophagy gene , Rb1cc1 , along with Brca1 and Trp53 , through utilization of the K14-Cre transgene. We found that Rb1cc1 deletion suppressed tumorigenesis in the BRCA1-deficient model when compared to wild type and heterozygous Rb1cc1 controls. However , in contrast to previous studies in the mouse mammary tumor<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( MMTV)- polyoma middle T antigen ( PyMT) model , tumor growth and the distribution of histological subtypes were not affected by loss of RB1CC1. Interestingly , loss of RB1CC1 decreased mitochondrial mass and oxidative respiratory capacity of these tumor cells , along with a decrease in the phosphorylation of MTOR substrates and transcript levels of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. Importantly , we observed an increased sensitivity to mitochondrial disrupting agents upon loss of RB1CC1. Consequently , our data showed that combination of an autophagy inhibitor , spautin-1 , along with a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor , metformin , was more effective in limiting oxidative respiratory capacity , colony-forming ability and tumor growth. Altogether , our results indicate that inhibition of autophagy can increase the benefits of metformin treatment in BRCA1-deficient breast cancers.
