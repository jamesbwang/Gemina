 The ductus arteriosus ( DA) connects the main pulmonary artery and the aorta in fetal circulation and closes spontaneously within days after birth in normal infants. Abnormal patent DA ( PDA) causes morbidities and mortality , especially in preterm infants. Closure of the DA is a complex interactive process involving two events: functional and anatomic closure. Functional closure by smooth muscle contraction was achieved through the regulatory factors of vaso-reactivity. These factors include oxygen sensing system , glutamate , osmolality , prostaglandin E â‚‚ , nitric oxide , and carbon monoxide. Anatomic closure by vascular remodeling involved several vascular components including endothelium , extracellular matrix , smooth muscle cells , and intraluminal blood cells. Despite advances in understanding of PDA pathogenesis , the molecular mechanism for regulation of DA closure is complex and not fully understood. In this article we review recent evidence regarding the molecular mechanisms of DA closure.
