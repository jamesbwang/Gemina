 Reactive oxygen species ( ROS) play important roles in hematopoiesis and regulate the self-renewal , migration , and myeloid differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs). This study was conducted to determine whether ROS levels in donor HSCs correlate with neutrophil and platelet engraftment in patients after bone<disease> marrow transplantation. Cryopreserved HSC samples from 51 patients who underwent autologous transplantation were studied. Levels of intracellular ROS were assessed by flow cytometry using 2 ' ,7 '- dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate ( H
