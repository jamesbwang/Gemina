 Quinic acid ( QA) and shikimic acid ( SA) , two kinds of natural organic acids , have been reported to exhibit potent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>. In this study , the effects of QA and SA on the cellular functions of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> were investigated by measuring the intracellular pH , intracellular and extracellular ATP concentrations , succinate dehydrogenase activity , DNA content , and interactions between SA and QA with S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> DNA. Studies of the cellular functions demonstrated that QA could significantly decrease the intracellular pH , whereas SA had no effect on intracellular pH. QA and SA reduced succinate dehydrogenase activity and caused a significant decrease in intracellular ATP concentration but no proportional increase in extracellular ATP. Moreover , QA and SA both could remarkably reduce the DNA content of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and directly interact with genomic DNA. The results suggested that the effects of QA and SA on cellular functions were distinguishable , although the chemical structures of these two compounds were similar. In conclusion , the results of the present research suggested that SA and QA could be used as antibacterial agents in food preservation.
