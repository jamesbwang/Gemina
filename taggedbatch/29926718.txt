 Reliable and sensitive in situ detection of molecules released from live cells attracts tremendous research interest , as it shows significance in pathological and physiological investigation. In the present work , a novel electrochemiluminescent ( ECL) luminophore , N- ( aminobutyl)- N- ( ethylisoluminol)- functionalized Ag nanoparticles modified three-dimensional ( 3D) polyaniline-phytic acid conducting hydrogel ( ABEI-Ag@PAni-PA) , is synthesized to adhere cells for in situ sensitive ECL detection of hydrogen peroxide ( H
