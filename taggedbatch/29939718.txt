 The optical control of atomic relocations in a metallic quantum point contact is of great interest because it addresses the fundamental limit of `` CMOS scaling ''. Here , by developing a platform for combined electronics and photonics on the atomic scale , we demonstrate an optically controlled electronic switch based on the relocation of atoms. It is shown through experiments and simulations how the interplay between electrical , optical , and light-induced thermal forces can reversibly relocate a few atoms and enable atomic photodetection with a digital electronic response , a high resistance extinction ratio ( 70 dB) , and a low OFF-state current ( 10 pA) at room temperature. Additionally , the device introduced here displays an optically induced pinched hysteretic current ( optical memristor). The photodetector has been tested in an experiment with real optical data at 0.5 Gbit/s , from which an eye diagram visualizing millions of detection cycles could be produced. This demonstrates the durability of the realized atomic scale devices and establishes them as alternatives to traditional photodetectors.
