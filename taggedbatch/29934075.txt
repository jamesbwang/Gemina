 tRNA fragments ( tRFs) are a class of small , regulatory RNAs with diverse functions. 3 '- Derived tRFs perfectly match long terminal repeat ( LTR)- retroelements which use the 3 '- end of tRNAs to prime reverse transcription. Recent work has shown that tRFs target LTR-retroviruses and- transposons for the RNA interference ( RNAi) pathway and also inhibit mobility by blocking reverse transcription. The highly conserved tRNA primer binding site ( PBS) in LTR-retroelements is a unique target for 3 '- tRFs to recognize and block abundant but diverse LTR-retrotransposons that become transcriptionally active during epigenetic reprogramming in development and disease. 3 '- tRFs are processed from full-length tRNAs under so far unknown conditions and potentially protect many cell types. tRFs appear to be an ancient link between RNAi , transposons , and genome stability.
