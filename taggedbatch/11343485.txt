 Diseases affecting the brain contribute to a substantial proportion of morbidity and mortality in the general population. Conditions such as stroke , dementia and cognitive impairment have a prominent impact on global public health. Despite the heterogeneous clinical manifestations of these conditions and their diverse prognostic implications , current evidence supports a role for cardiovascular disease as a common pathophysiological ground. Brain white matter hyperintensities ( WMH) are patchy white matter signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences commonly found in elderly individuals. WMH appear to have a vascular pathogenesis and have been shown to confer an increased risk of stroke and cognitive decline. Indeed , they were proposed as a marker for central nervous system frailty. Cardiovascular diseases seem to play a key role in the etiology of WMH. Carotid atherosclerosis and atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> were shown to be associated with higher WMH burden , while adequate blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control has been reported reducing WMH progression. Aim of the present work is to review the available evidence linking WMH to cardiovascular disease , highlighting the complex interplay between cerebral and cardiovascular health.
