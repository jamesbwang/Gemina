 The +6 oxidation state of iron generally exists in the form of ferrate ( VI) with high redox potential and environmentally friendly nature. Although ferrate ( VI) has been known for over a century , its chemistry is still limited to the solvent-based reactions that suffers from the insolubility/instability of this oxidant and the environmental issues caused by hazardous solvents. Herein , we explore the solvent-free reactivity of ferrate ( VI) under mechanical milling , revealing that its strong oxidizing power is accessible in the `` dry '' solid state towards a broad variety of substrates , for examole , aromatic alcohols/aldehydes and carbon nanotubes. More significantly , solvent-free mechanochemistry also reshapes the oxidizing ability of ferrate ( VI) due to the underlying solvent-free effect and the promotive mechanical actions. This study opens up a new chemistry of ferrate ( VI) with promising application in green oxidative transformation of both organic and inorganic substrates.
