 Covalent functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes ( SWCNTs) is a promising route to enhance the quantum yield of exciton emission and can lead to single-photon emission at room temperature. However , the spectral linewidth of the defect-related E11 * emission remains rather broad. Here , we systematically investigate the low-temperature exciton emission of individual SWCNTs that have been dispersed with sodium-deoxycholate ( DOC) and polyfluorene ( PFO-BPy) , are grown by laser vaporization ( LV) or by CoMoCat techniques and are functionalized with oxygen as well as 3,5-dichlorobenzene groups. The E11 excitons in oxygen-functionalized SWCNTs remain rather broad with up to 10 meV linewidth while exciton emission from 3,5-dichlorobenzene functionalized SWCNTs is found to be about one order of magnitude narrower. In all cases , wrapping with PFO-BPy provides significantly better protection against pump induced dephasing compared to DOC. To further study the influence of exciton localization on pump-induced dephasing , we have embedded the functionalized SWCNTs into metallo-dielectric antenna cavities to maximize light collection. We show that 0D excitons attributed to the E11 * emission of 3,5-dichlorobenzene quantum defects of LV-grown SWCNTs can display near resolution-limited linewidths down to 35 Î¼eV. Interestingly , these 0D excitons give rise to a 3-fold suppressed pump-induced exciton dephasing compared to the E11 excitons in the same SWCNT. These findings provide a foundation to build a unified description of the emergence of novel optical behavior from the interplay of covalently introduced defects , dispersants , and exciton confinement in SWCNTs and might further lead to the realization of indistinguishable photons from carbon nanotubes.
