 Neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs) are DNA fibers decorated with histones and antimicrobial proteins from cytoplasmic granules released into the extracellular space in a process denominated NETosis. The molecular pathways involved in NETosis have not been completely understood. Classical NETosis mechanisms involve the neutrophil elastase ( NE) translocation to nucleus due to the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) by NADPH oxidase ( NOX2) or the peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 ( PAD4) activation in response to an increase in extracellular calcium influx; both mechanisms result in DNA decondensation. Previously , we reported that trophozoites and lipopeptidophosphoglycan from
