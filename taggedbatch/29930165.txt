 Posterior root medial meniscus ( PRMM) tears have shown to be biomechanically equivalent to complete meniscectomy. Drawbacks from PRMM tears repair are unsatisfactory healing rates. In this case report , we outlined a PRMM reconstruction with gracilis<pathogen> graft healing outcome in chronic PRMM tear case , based on clinical and MRI evaluation. A 60-year-old man reported a chief complaint of increasing pain on the right knee joint in the last 1 year after a deep-flexion injury. On MRI investigation , we confirmed the chronic PRMM tear as Osteoarthritis Kellgren-Lawrence grade II. Then , we planned to perform a PRMM reconstruction with gracilis<pathogen> graft per arthroscopy. At the 6-month MRI evaluation , we found healing of the attached PRMM on its footprints , with intact graft transition from the meniscus to the tibial bone tunnel.
