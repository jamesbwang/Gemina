 The number of elderly patients with esophageal cancer is expected to increase. We aimed to determine the postoperative outcomes of esophagectomy for esophageal cancer in elderly patients. A retrospective , population-based analysis was performed using the National inpatient sample for the period 2000-2014. Adult patients ≥ 18 years old ( yo) diagnosed with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy during their inpatient hospitalization were included. Patients were categorized into < 70 yo and ≥ 70 yo. Multivariable linear and logistic regressions were used to assess the potential effect of age on postoperative complications , inpatient mortality , and hospital charges. Overall , 5243 patients were included , with 3699 ( 70.6 %) < 70 yo and 1544 ( 29.5 %) ≥ 70 yo. The yearly rate of esophagectomies among patients ≥ 70 yo did not significantly changed during the study period ( 28.4 % in 2000 and 26.3 % in 2014 , P = 0.76). Elderly patients were significantly more likely to have postoperative cardiac failure ( odds ratio 1.59 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.21 , 2.09 , P = 0.0009) and inpatient mortality ( odds ratio 1.84 , 95 % CI 1.39 , 2.45 , P < 0.0001). Among the elderly patients , hospital charges were , on average , $ 16,320 greater ( 95 % CI $ 3110 , $ 29,530) than patients < 70 yo ( P = 0.02). The predicted probability of mortality increased consistently across age ( 1.5 % in 40 yo , 2.5 % in 50 yo , 3.6 % in 60 yo , 5.4 % in 70 yo , and 7.0 % in 80 yo). Elderly patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer have a significantly higher risk of postoperative mortality and pose a higher financial burden on the health care system. Elderly patients with esophageal cancer should be carefully selected for surgery.
