 Phospholipase D ( PLD) was firstly hyperactivated by the bio-imprinting and , then , these hyperactivated PLD molecules were immobilized by adsorption and precipitation , followed by cross-linking. The high degree of conformational rigidification provided by intra- and intermolecular cross-linking can make PLD `` remember '' imprint-induced characteristics even in aqueous solutions. The obtained immobilized PLD showed the excellent catalytic performance. The maximum activity of immobilized PLD reached 166953 U/g
