 To use Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System ( LI-RADS) categorization and features of hepatocellular carcinomas ( HCCs) to intraindividually compare gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( Gd-DTPA-MRI) and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI ( Gd-EOB-MRI) , before and after applying modified major features. Of 77 HCCs in 64 patients analysed , 17 HCCs were confirmed histopathologically and 46 patients had cirrhosis. Gd-EOB-MRI and Gd-DTPA-MRI were evaluated for the presence of major and ancillary features by two radiologists. LI-RADS categorization was done for Gd-DTPA-MRI ( LI-RADS-DTPA) and for Gd-EOB-MRI before and after applying modified major features ( hepatobiliary phase ( HBP) hypointensity as an additional major feature , LI-RADS-EOBm1; HBP hypointense rim as capsule appearance , LI-RADS-EOBm2; and transitional phase ( TP) hypointensity as washout appearance , LI-RADS-EOBm3). Sensitivities of LR-5 categorization for the diagnosis of HCC were compared. Washout ( p = 0.012) and capsule appearance ( p < 0.001) were less frequently observed on Gd-EOB-MRI. Sensitivity for LR-5 categorization was significantly higher with LI-RADS-DTPA compared with LI-RADS-EOB ( p = 0.001) and LI-RADS-EOBm2 ( p = 0.004) , while sensitivity for LR-5 categorization with LI-RADS-EOBm1 ( p = 0.210) and LI-RADS-EOBm3 ( p = 0.727) was comparable. Modifying LI-RADS for use with Gd-EOB-MRI , such as applying HBP hypointensity as an additional major feature or using TP hypointensity as washout appearance , can improve the sensitivity for the detection of HCC. • Adding HBP hypointensity as additional major feature improved sensitivity of LR-5 categorization. • Adding TP hypointensity as modified washout appearance improved sensitivity of LR-5 categorization. • Sensitivities for LR-5 classification were comparable between LI-RADS-DTPA , LI-RADS-EOBm1 , and LI-RADS-EOBm3.
