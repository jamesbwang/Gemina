 Exacerbations are common during the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) and contribute to its morbidity and mortality. COPD is also associated with high prevalence of anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom>. A systematic literature review of data on the association between anxiety<symptom> and/or depression<symptom> and COPD exacerbations. Medline search , for the 1980-2017 period , with the following keywords: `` chronic obstructive pulmonary disease '' or `` COPD '' and `` exacerbation '' and `` anxiety<symptom> '' or `` depression<symptom> ''; limits: `` title/abstract ''; the selected languages were English or French. Among 152 articles , 77 abstracts have been preselected for a dual reading and 30 studies have been finally selected. The prevalence of anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> ranged from 6.7 to 58 % and 5.5 to 51.5 % , respectively. Among the 30 studies included in this review , 19 ( 63.3 %) revealed positive associations between anxiety<symptom> and/or depression<symptom> and increased risk for exacerbations , although 11 ( 36.7 %) failed to support such an association. The association between anxiety<symptom> and/or depression<symptom> and an increased risk of COPD exacerbations was more frequently observed in studies using an event-based definition ( 85.7 %) than in those using a symptom-based definition ( 14.3 %). The main limitation of this review is the high heterogeneity of the studies included. Another limitation is the low rate of women included in this review ( 32.6 %). Anxiety<symptom> and/or depression<symptom> are associated with a greater risk for exacerbations to occur in COPD. However , a high heterogeneity across the published studies makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusions on the amplitude of this increased risk.
