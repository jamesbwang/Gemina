 CD4 T cells convey a number of discrete functions to protective immunity to influenza<pathogen><disease> , a complexity that distinguishes this arm of adaptive immunity from B cells and CD8 T cells. Although the most well recognized function of CD4 T cells is provision of help for antibody production , CD4 T cells are important in many aspects of protective immunity. Our studies have revealed that viral antigen specificity is a key determinant of CD4 T cell function , as illustrated both by mouse models of infection and human vaccine responses , a factor whose importance is due at least in part to events in viral antigen handling. We discuss research that has provided insight into the diverse viral epitope specificity of CD4 T cells elicited after infection , how this primary response is modified as CD4 T cells home to the lung , establish memory , and after challenge with a secondary and distinct influenza<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> strain. Our studies in human subjects point out the challenges facing vaccine efforts to facilitate responses to novel and avian strains of influenza<pathogen><disease> , as well as strategies that enhance the ability of CD4 T cells to promote protective antibody responses to both seasonal and potentially pandemic strains of influenza<pathogen><disease>.
