 So far , studies on possible association of plasma lipid levels and depressive disorder are contradictory. This prospective work aimed at assessing a plasma lipid profile in individuals with major depression<symptom> and healthy controls. In total , 94 patients with major depression<symptom> and 152 healthy controls were included in this prospective study. After an overnight fasting state of 12 h they underwent blood drawing for triglyzerides ( TG) , total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL)- and high-density lipoprotein ( HDL)- cholesterol measurements. All participants were evaluated in a clinical interview and filled out the self-rating Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory ( BDI-II) scale to identify depressive symptomatology. Ninety-four patients with major depression<symptom> showed significantly higher median ( interquartile range) plasma TG levels ( 108.0 ( 75.8-154.1) vs. 84.0 ( 63.0-132.2) mg/dL , P = 0.014) and significantly lower HDL-cholesterol levels ( 55.0 ( 46.9-123.0) vs. 61.5 ( 47.4-72.6) mg/dL , P = 0.049) compared to 152 individuals without depression<symptom> , respectively. Total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations were observed slightly higher in patients with major depression<symptom>. Significant positive correlation was found between TG , total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations and the BDI-II score ( p = 0.027 , 0.048 and 0.018) , and in tendency negative correlation between HDL-cholesterol levels and the BDI-II score ( P = 0.091) , respectively. Depressive individuals were found with adverse plasma lipid patterns of higher TG and lower HDL-cholesterol levels compared to healthy controls. On this basis , the authors would suggest the implementation of routine lipid measurements in order to stratify these patients by their cardiovascular risk.
