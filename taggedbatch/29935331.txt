 Colistin has historically been considered a last-line therapeutic option against multidrug-resistant ( MDR) Gram-negative bacterial infections. However , chromosomally-encoded and plasmid-mediated colistin resistance is increasingly being reported worldwide. The spread of the plasmid-borne colistin resistance gene mcr-1 is of great concern since it can be transferred among bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of colistin resistance gene mcr-1 in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> collected from human clinical specimens in Thailand. The minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC) of colistin by broth microdilution ( BMD) method was determined in 317 non-duplicate isolates ( 37 E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and 280K. pneumoniae<pathogen>). All isolates were screened for the mcr-1 gene using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR). The colistin MIC This is the first report on the prevalence of the colistin resistance gene mcr-1 in colistin-resistant E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> isolated from humans in Thailand. This data provides added insight into the mechanism of colistin resistance among Enterbacteriaceae pathogens.
