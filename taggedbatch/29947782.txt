 Pancreatic steatosis may contribute to ß-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes ( T2D) , but data are controversial. Women who had gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM) are at high risk for developing T2D. To examine the association of pancreatic fat content with early/first-phase insulin secretion ( as markers of β-cell function). Cross-sectional analysis of a subcohort of the monocentric , prospective cohort study PPS-Diab. Ludwig-Maximilians-University Hospital , Munich , Germany. 97 women , 3 to 16 months after pregnancy ( 41 normoglycemic women post GDM , 19 women post GDM with pathological glucose metabolism and 37 normoglycemic women after a normoglycemic pregnancy ( controls)). Correlation of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) measured pancreatic fat content with early insulin release in an oral glucose tolerance test ( IR30) and first-phase insulin response in an intravenous glucose tolerance test ( FPIR; n = 65) , both adjusted for insulin sensitivity index ( ISI). Pancreatic fat content did not correlate with IR30 and FPIR adjusted for ISI. It correlated positively with BMI , waist circumference , liver fat and intraabdominal fat volume. Pancreatic fat content does not correlate with ß-cell function in a cohort of young women with different degrees of T2D risk.
