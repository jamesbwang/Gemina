 Current study was designed to evaluate protective effect of mangiferin and its interaction with low dose of nitric oxide ( NO) modulators in complete Freund 's adjuvant ( CFA) inoculated rats. Male wistar rats ( 200-300 g , n = 8 per group) were used in the study. On day `` 0 '' of study arthritis<disease><symptom> was induced in rats by injecting 0.2 ml CFA in sub-planter region of right hind paw of animals. Treatment with methotrexate ( 5 mg/kg) , mangiferin ( 10-30 mg/kg) alone and in combination with NO modulators was given ( i.p.) from days 14 to 28. After 28 days , blood and joint synovial fluid was collected for biochemical analysis and rat paws were excised to estimate MDA and SOD in tissue ( paw) homogenates. CFA inoculation significantly increases ( 1) arthritic index , ( 2) ankle diameter , ( 3) paw volume , and ( 4) serum TNF-α , IL-6 , IL-1β , and synovial TNF-α levels ( p < 0.001). The serum Th
