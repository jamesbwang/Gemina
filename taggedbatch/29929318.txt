 A method to improve bromine fixation by co-pyrolysis of non-metallic fractions ( NMFs) of waste printed circuit boards ( WPCBs) with Bayer red mud ( RM) has been developed. More than 78.59 wt % of bromine was fixed into the solid residues with an addition of 15 wt % RM after co-pyrolysis at 500 Â°C , comparing with 36.42 wt % without the RM addition. Metal oxides ( Fe
