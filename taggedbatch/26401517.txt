 To evaluate whether the clinical benefit and relapse rates in anti-muscle-specific kinase ( MuSK) myasthenia gravis ( MG) differ depending on the protocol of rituximab followed. This retrospective multicentre study in patients with MuSK MG compared three rituximab protocols in terms of clinical status , relapse , changes in treatment , and adverse side effects. The primary effectiveness endpoint was clinical relapse requiring a further infusion of rituximab. Survival curves were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and survival analyses were undertaken using Cox proportional-hazards models. Twenty-five patients were included: 11 treated with protocol 4 + 2 ( 375 mg/m This study provides class IV evidence that the 4 + 2 rituximab protocol has a lower clinical relapse rate and produces a more durable response than the 1 + 1 and 4 protocols in patients with MuSK MG.
