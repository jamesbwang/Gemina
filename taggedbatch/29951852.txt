 In a 30-year-old chef with recurrent delayed angioedema history as well as the experimental detection of IgE antibodies against galactose-alpha- ( 1,3)- galactose ( alpha-Gal) pointed to alpha-Gal as the causative agent. The diagnosis , therefore , was delayed anaphylaxis due to alpha-Gal. Because of the potential relationship to his profession , we submitted a dermatologist 's report BK 5101 to the liability and insurance association , whereupon his contract of employment was terminated without notice. As a consequence , we reported an occupational disease. This case demonstrates an underdiagnosed , potentially life-threatening allergy to the disaccharide alpha-Gal in red meat as an occupational disease.
