 Medical tourism has a potential of spreading multi-drug resistant bacteria ( MDR). The Hadassah Medical Center serves as a referral center for global medical tourists and for Palestinian Authority residents. In order to assess whether patients of these groups are more likely to harbor MDR bacteria than local residents , we reviewed data from all patients admitted to our institution between 2009 and 2014. We compared MDR rates between countries of residency , controlling for gender , age , previous hospitalization and time from admission to MDR detection. Overall , among 111,577 patients with at least one microbiological specimen taken during hospitalization , there were 3,985 ( 3.5 %) patients with at least one MDR-positive culture. Compared to Israeli patients , tourists and patients from the Palestinian Authority had increased rates of MDR positivity ( OR , 95 % CI): 2.3 ( 1.6 to 2.3) and 8.0 ( 6.3 to 10.1) , respectively. Our data show that foreign patients seeking advanced medical care are more likely to carry MDR bacteria than the resident population. Strategies to minimize MDR spread , such as pre-admission screening or pre-emptive isolation should be considered in this population.
