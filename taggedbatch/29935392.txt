 As a sulfonylurea herbicide , sulfosulfuron is extensively applied in controlling broad-leaves and weeds in agriculture. It may cause a potential risk for human and herbivores health due to its widely application and residue in crops and fruits. The study of the binding characteristics of calf thymus DNA ( ct-DNA) with sulfosulfuron was performed through a series of spectroscopic techniques and computer simulation. The experimental results showed sulfosulfuron interacted with ct-DNA through the groove binding. The negative values of thermodynamic parameter ( Î”H
