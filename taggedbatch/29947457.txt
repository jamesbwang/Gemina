 Transforming Care is making mixed progress in supporting people with intellectual and developmental disabilities , and complex needs , move to more appropriate specialist accommodations closer to home. Community support staff often spend greatest amounts of time with service-users , yet are some of the least heard voices about why placements succeed and fail to varying extents. Managers and support staff ( n = 13) , working in ostensibly `` specialist '' community placements , were interviewed about perceived barriers and facilitators to implementing Transforming Care. Transcripts were subjected to thematic analysis. Participants identified difficulties balancing people 's rights , safety and quality of life needs , and felt the system 's expectations of them are hard to deliver within the resources , legislation , values and support models provided them. Multidisciplinary expertise was highly valued for both emotional and practical support , but was least valued when perceived as overly blaming or inspectorial. Specialist health input was seen to withdraw prematurely for this particular client group. Recommendations are provided for how staff perspectives should inform Transforming Care in interests of service-users.
