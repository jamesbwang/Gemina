 In the last 15 years , the market for prosthetic arms and hands has shifted toward systems with greater degrees of actuation. There has also been a progressive use of emerging technologies to overcome hardware design challenges. Moreover , the proliferation of rapid prototyping has resulted in applications in the prosthetic market. Even though there are concerns on robustness and wide-user acceptance , the affordable and customizable solution offered by rapid prototyping , combined with the possibility for easy maintenance and repair , is very attractive for prosthesis design. Areas covered: Functional layouts for multi-articulated , dexterous 3D printed hands and sockets are freely available , with many patients using them at home. We provide an overview of the current solutions , compare their features , and discuss their potential impact on the field of prosthetics. Expert commentary: The high level of low-cost customization is an appealing concept , but this comes with challenges not yet systematically addressed; such challenges include durability , sufficient grip strength , reproducibility , and general appeal to the wide range of users. The introduction of new printable materials could assist in overcoming some of these issues , but present an added risk of compromising the low cost and wide availability.
