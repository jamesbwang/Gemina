 Australian native species grow competitively in nutrient limited environments , particularly in nitrogen ( N) limited soils; however , the mechanism that enables this is poorly understood. Biological nitrification inhibition ( BNI) , which is the release of root exudates into the plant rhizosphere to inhibit the nitrification process , is a hypothesized adaptive mechanism for maximizing N uptake. To date , few studies have investigated the temporal pattern and components of root exudates by Australian native plant species for BNI. This study examined root exudates<symptom> from two Australian native species ,
