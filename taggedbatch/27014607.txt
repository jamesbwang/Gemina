 Teeth segmentation is an important task in computer-aided procedures and clinical diagnosis. In this paper , we propose an accurate and robust algorithm based on watershed and morphology operators for teeth and pulp segmentation and a new approach for enamel segmentation in cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT) images. Proposed method consists of five steps: acquiring appropriate CBCT image , image enhancement , teeth segmentation using the marker-controlled watershed ( MCW) , enamel segmentation by global threshold , and finally , utilizing the MCW for pulp segmentation. Proposed algorithms evaluated on a dataset consisting 69 patient images. Experimental results show a high accuracy and specificity for teeth , enamel , and pulp segmentation. MCW algorithm and local threshold are accurate and robust approaches to segment tooth , enamel , and pulp tissues. Methods overcome the over-segmentation phenomenon and artifacts reduction.
