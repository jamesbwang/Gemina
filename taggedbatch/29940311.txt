 Steroid hormone receptors are important regulators of development and physiology in bilaterian animals , but the role of steroid signaling in cnidarians has been contentious. Cnidarians produce steroids , including A-ring aromatic steroids with a side-chain , but these are probably made through pathways different than the one used by vertebrates to make their A-ring aromatic steroids. Here we present comparative genomic analyses indicating the presence of a previously undescribed nuclear receptor family within medusozoan cnidarians , that we propose to call NR3E. This family predates the diversification of ERR/ER/SR in bilaterians , indicating that the first NR3 evolved in the common ancestor of the placozoan and cnidarian-bilaterian with lineage-specific loss in the anthozoans , even though multiple species in this lineage have been shown to produce aromatic steroids , whose function remain unclear. We discovered serendipitously that a cytoplasmic factor within epidermal cells of transgenic Hydra vulgaris<pathogen> can trigger the nuclear translocation of heterologously expressed human ERα. This led us to hypothesize that aromatic steroids may also be present in the medusozoan cnidarian lineage , which includes Hydra , and may explain the translocation of human ERα. Docking experiments with paraestrol A , a cnidarian A-ring aromatic steroid , into the ligand-binding pocket of Hydra NR3E indicates that , if an aromatic steroid is indeed the true ligand , which remains to be demonstrated , it would bind to the pocket through a partially distinct mechanism from the manner in which estradiol binds to vertebrate ER.
