 To explore whether functional electrical stimulation of the hamstrings results in improved knee kinematics in chronic stroke survivors walking with a stiff knee gait. Quasi-experimental. Sixteen adult chronic stroke survivors. Survivors received functional electrical stimulation of the hamstrings , 3 times a week for 1 h during a period of 5 weeks. 3D kinematics was calculated before the training period and after 5 weeks of training. Knee kinematics of walking without stimulation before the training period was compared with walking with stimulation after 5 weeks of training. ( intervention effect). In addition , knee kinematics of walking without stimulation before the training period was compared with walking without stimulation after the training period ( therapeutic effect). The intervention effect showed a significant increase , of mean 8.7 ° ( standard deviation ( SD) 8.3 , p = 0.001) , in peak knee flexion. The therapeutic effect showed a significant increase in peak knee flexion , of mean 3.1 ° ( SD 4.7 , p = 0.021) Conclusion: The results of this exploratory study suggest an increase in knee kinematics in swing after functional electrical stimulation of the hamstrings in stroke survivors walking with a stiff knee gait. The largest improvement in peak knee flexion in swing was seen when participants walked with hamstring stimulation. Participants with low neurological impairment responded better to hamstring stimulation , and there are indications that the effect of hamstring stimulation can be predicted during a single session. The effect of functional electrical stimulation is comparable to that of more invasive treatment options , such as botulinum<pathogen> toxin ( BTX) or soft-tissue surgery. This makes functional electrical stimulation a feasible treatment option for daily clinical practice.
