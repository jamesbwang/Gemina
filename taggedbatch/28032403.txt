 Our society has become data-rich to the extent that research in many areas has become impossible without computational approaches. Educational programmes seem to be lagging behind this development. At the same time , there is a growing need not only for strong data science skills , but foremost for the ability to both translate between tools and methods on the one hand , and application and problems on the other. Here we present our experiences with shaping and running a masters ' programme in bioinformatics and systems biology in Amsterdam. From this , we have developed a comprehensive philosophy on how translation in training may be achieved in a dynamic and multidisciplinary research area , which is described here. We furthermore describe two requirements that enable translation , which we have found to be crucial: sufficient depth and focus on multidisciplinary topic areas , coupled with a balanced breadth from adjacent disciplines. Finally , we present concrete suggestions on how this may be implemented in practice , which may be relevant for the effectiveness of life science and data science curricula in general , and of particular interest to those who are in the process of setting up such curricula. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
