 Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O104: H4 ( E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O104: H4) , which caused in 2011 a massive foodborne outbreak in Germany , is characterized by an unusual combination of virulence traits. E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O104: H4 contains a prophage-encoded Shiga toxin ( Stx) gene , which is the cardinal virulence factor of enterohemorrhagic E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( EHEC). However , the outbreak strain shares highest DNA sequence similarity with enteroaggregative E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( EAEC) and displays the EAEC-characteristic tight adherence to epithelial cells. The virulence potential of the underlying EAEC background has not been investigated and it is therefore not clear whether E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O104: H4 displays distinct virulence characteristics in comparison to prototypical EAEC. In this study , we performed a detailed comparative phenotypic characterization of the Stx phage-cured E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O104: H4 strain C227-11φcu , the closely related EAEC strain 55989 and two other well-characterized EAEC strains 042 and 17-2 with focus on virulence traits. C227-11φcu displayed superior aggregative adherence phenotype to cultured HCT-8 epithelial cells , adhering with 3-6 times more bacteria per epithelial cells than the tested EAEC strains. Otherwise , C227-11φcu showed similar virulence characteristics to its closest relative 55989 , i.e. strong acid resistance , good biofilm formation and cytotoxic culture supernatants. Furthermore , C227-11φcu was characterized by significantly weaker motility and pro-inflammatory properties than 55989 and 042 , nevertheless stronger than 17-2. Taken together , C227-11φcu displayed mostly robust , but not outstanding virulence characteristics in comparison to the tested EAEC. Therefore , it appears likely that the combination of Stx production and EAEC characteristics in general , rather than an exceptionally potent EAEC background resulted in the unusual virulence of the E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O104: H4. Thus , the emergence of such hypervirulent strains in the future might be more likely than previously anticipated.
