 Basal cell nevus syndrome<disease><symptom> ( BCNS) is an autosomal dominant disorder most commonly caused by a germline mutation in the PTCH1 gene. PTCH1 is known to have different isoforms with different functional properties and expression patterns among tissues. We detected a novel , pathogenic de novo mutation in PTCH1 isoform 1b ( c. 114delG) in a BCNS patient. Furthermore , we elucidated the specific expression pattern of PTCH1 isoforms in normal skin , BCC and peripheral blood by studying expression of different PTCH1 isoforms. Human skin showed expression of isoforms 1b and 1d , while peripheral blood additionally showed 1a and 1e expression. BCCs showed expression of all isoforms. Here we report a patient with a novel , isoform 1b specific mutation in PTCH1 and thereby distinguish PTCH1 isoform 1b as the major transcript in the development of BCNS.
