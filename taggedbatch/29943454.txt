 In this work we have studied the phosphoryl transfer reaction in RNA in alkaline conditions by theoretically exploring the influence of several solvents. The calculations have been carried out using the M06-2X functional while the solvents are taken as a continuum using the SMD method. The main results are that the O2 '- P-O5 ' angle in the reactants , the free activation energies and the reaction mechanism are clearly dependent on the dielectric constant of the environment , thus showing that the electrostatic term is determining for this chemical system with two negative charges. Our study seems to indicate that water , the solvent with the greatest dielectric constant , would be the one that mostly increases the reaction rate. As this is not the case in enzymatic catalysis , one has to conclude that , in the case of proteins as well as in the case of ribozymes , the enzymatic catalysis is not mainly due to the solvent reaction field , but to local electrical fields due to the enzyme preorganization.
