 Acute coronary syndromes<disease><symptom> represent a major cause of mortality in our country. There is a very wide spectrum of clinical presentation since the actual classification of acute coronary syndromes<disease><symptom> is based on electrocardiographic presentation , that is to say based on absence or presence of ST segment elevation. When dealing with an acute<symptom> chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , once the probability of acute coronary syndrome<disease><symptom> is established , the emergency care must follow the scientific guidelines. One of the critical steps is represented by the evaluation of ischaemic and hemorrhagic risk in order to tailor optimally antithrombotic and anticoagulation therapies and revascularization timing. This article summarizes the main points of the emergency care from the diagnosis to risk stratification.
