 Hepatic mitochondrial function ( HMF) assessed by the 77 patients with NAFLD and 11 healthy control subjects were studied. HMF was assessed using HMF ( cPDR over 1 h) was lower in NAFLD compared to controls ( 13.4 % ( 4.8) v. 21.0 % ( 6.3); p < 0.0001)). In NAFLD , HMF was lower in patients with diabetes versus no diabetes ( 12.7 % ( 3.4) v. 14.3 % ( 6.1); p = 0.003)). Regression modelling showed age ( β = -0.08; p = 0.01) , waist circumference ( β = -0.08; p = 0.01) , hip circumference ( β = -0.04; p = 0.01) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) ( β = -0.05; p = 0.01) and diabetes status ( β = -1.81; p = 0.01) were independently associated with HMF ( R In patients with NAFLD ( compared to healthy subjects) , there was a reduction in HMF assessed by the
