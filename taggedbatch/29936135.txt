 Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( CA-MRSA) , typified by the pulse-field type USA300 , is an emerging endemic pathogen that is spreading rapidly among healthy people. CA-MRSA causes skin and soft<disease> tissue<disease> infections<disease> , life-threatening necrotizing pneumonia<disease> and sepsis<disease> , and is remarkably resistant to many antibiotics. Here we show that engineered liposomes composed of naturally occurring sphingomyelin were able to sequester cytolytic toxins secreted by USA300 and prevent necrosis<symptom> of human erythrocytes , peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bronchial epithelial cells. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed the capture by liposomes of phenol-soluble modulins , α-hemolysin and other toxins. Sphingomyelin liposomes prevented hemolysis<symptom> induced by pure phenol-soluble modulin-α3 , one of the main cytolytic components in the USA300 secretome. In contrast , sphingomyelin liposomes harboring a high cholesterol content ( 66 mol/ %) were unable to protect human cells from phenol-soluble modulin-α3-induced lysis , however these liposomes efficiently sequestered the potent staphylococcal toxin α-hemolysin. In a murine cutaneous abscess<symptom> model , a single dose of either type of liposomes was sufficient to significantly decrease tissue dermonecrosis. Our results provide further insights into the promising potential of tailored liposomal therapy in the battle against infectious<disease> diseases<disease>.
