 To identify the differentially expressed microRNAs ( miRNAs) profiles of yang and yin syndromes<disease><symptom> in patients with acute ischemic stroke , and to provide the molecular basis of the classififi cation of these two syndrome<disease><symptom> types in acute ischemic stroke patients. A microarray assay was performed to assess the expression pattern of miRNAs in the lymphocyte<symptom> of acute ischemic stroke patients. Target genes for the deregulated miRNAs were predicated using the online bioinformatic algorithms and functional annotation via Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis for miRNAs predicted targets was carried out. Based on the predicted target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs , the miRNA-gene-network and miRNA-pathway-network were constructed. Yang score based on tongue texture , urine , dejecta , and appearance , etc. showed that clinical symptoms were distinct between yang and yin syndromes<disease><symptom>. There were significantly higher total leukocyte number and lower total protein level in patients with yang syndrome<disease><symptom> compared with those in patients with yin syndrome<disease><symptom> ( P < 0.05). Comprehensive miRNA analysis identified 36 unique down-regulated miRNAs in yang syndrome<disease><symptom> group , and 20 unique down-regulated and 2 unique up-regulated miRNAs in yin syndrome<disease><symptom> group. The key regulatory miRNAs , gene , and pathways in the yang syndrome<disease><symptom> were hsa-miR-93-5p and -320 b , enabled homolog , the metabolic pathways and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways , respectively , while those in the yin syndrome<disease><symptom> were hsa-miR-424-5p and -106 b-5p , CNOT4 , hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> and pathways in cancer , respectively. These results offered insight into the molecular basis underlying the different pathogenesis of yang or yin syndrome<disease><symptom> , providing clues for the individualized therapeutic strategies of acute ischemic stroke.
