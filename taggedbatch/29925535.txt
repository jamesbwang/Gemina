 Cardiac repolarization abnormalities in drug-induced and genetic long-QT syndrome<disease><symptom> may lead to afterdepolarizations and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes ( hiPSC-CMs) should help to overcome the limitations of animal models based on species differences in repolarization reserve. Here , we compared head-to-head the contribution of APs were measured with sharp microelectrodes in EHT from 3 different control hiPSC-CM lines and in tissue preparations from failing LV. EHT from hiPSC-CMs showed spontaneous diastolic depolarization and AP generation that were sensitive to low concentrations of ivabradine. EHT from hiPSC-CMs shows a lower repolarization reserve than human LV working myocardium and could thereby serve as a sensitive and specific human-based model for repolarization studies and arrhythmia , similar to Purkinje fibers. In both human LV and EHT ,
