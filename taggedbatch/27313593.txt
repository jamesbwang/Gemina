 Transfer RNA-derived fragments ( tRFs) represent a novel class of small RNAs ( sRNAs) generated through endonucleolytic cleavage of both mature and precursor transfer RNAs ( tRNAs). These 14-28 nt length tRFs that have been extensively studied in animal kingdom are to be explored in plants. In this study , we introduce a database of plant tRFs named PtRFdb ( www.nipgr.res.in/PtRFdb) , for the scientific community. We analyzed a total of 1344 sRNA sequencing datasets of 10 different plant species and identified a total of 5607 unique tRFs ( 758 tRF-1 , 2269 tRF-3 and 2580 tRF-5) , represented by 487 765 entries. In PtRFdb , detailed and comprehensive information is available for each tRF entry. Apart from the core information consisting of the tRF type , anticodon , source organism , tissue , sequence and the genomic location; additional information like PubMed identifier ( PMID) , Sample accession number ( GSM) , sequence length and frequency relevant to the tRFs may be of high utility to the user. Two different types of search modules ( Basic Search and Advanced Search) , sequence similarity search ( by BLAST) and Browse option with data download facility for each search is provided in this database. We believe that PtRFdb is a unique database of its kind and it will be beneficial in the validation and further characterization of plant tRFs.Database URL: http://www.nipgr.res.in/PtRFdb/.
