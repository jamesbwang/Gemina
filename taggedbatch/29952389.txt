 Utilizing high-energy beta particles emitted from radioisotopes for long-lifetime betavoltaic cells is a great challenge due to their low energy conversion efficiency ( ECE). Here we report a betavoltaic cell fabricated using black titania nanotube arrays ( TiO2 NTAs) by electrochemical anodization and Ar-annealing techniques. The obtained samples show enhanced electrical conductivity as well as Vis-NIR light absorption by the introduction of oxygen vacancy ( OV) and Ti3 + defects in reduced TiO2-x NTAs. A 20 mCi63 Ni source was assembled into TiO2 NTAs to form a sandwich-type betavoltaic cell. By I-V measurements , the Ar-annealed TiO2 NTAs at 650 Â°C exhibited a maximum ECE of 3.65 % with Voc = 1.13 V , Jsc = 103.3 nA cm-2 , and Pmax = 37 nW cm-2. In comparison with air-annealed TiO2 NTAs , the enhancement of the betavoltaic effect in reduced TiO2-x NTAs can be attributed to the suppression of e-h recombination induced by the generation of OV and Ti3 + defects , serving as electron donors as well as electron traps that not only contribute to the increase of electrical conductance , but also facilitate the charge carrier separation.
