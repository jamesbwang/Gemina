 The repressive activity of ancestral histone-like proteins helps integrate transcription of foreign genes with discrepant AT content into existing regulatory networks. Our investigations indicate that the AT-rich discriminator region located between the -10 promoter element and the transcription start site of the regulatory gene ssrA plays a distinct role in the balanced expression of the Salmonella<pathogen><disease> pathogenicity island-2 ( SPI2) type III secretion system. The RNA polymerase-binding protein DksA activates the ssrAB regulon post-transcriptionally , whereas the alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate ( ppGpp) relieves the negative regulation imposed by the AT-rich ssrA discriminator region. An increase in the GC-content of the ssrA discriminator region enhances ssrAB transcription and SsrB translation , thus activating the expression of downstream SPI2 genes. A Salmonella<pathogen><disease> strain expressing a GC-rich ssrA discriminator region is attenuated in mice and grows poorly intracellularly. The combined actions of ppGpp and DksA on SPI2 expression enable Salmonella to grow intracellularly , and cause disease in a murine model of infection. Collectively , these findings indicate that ( p) ppGpp relieves the negative regulation associated with the AT-rich discriminator region in the promoter of the horizontally-acquired ssrA gene , whereas DksA activates ssrB gene expression post-transcriptionally. The combined effects of ( p) ppGpp and DksA on the ssrAB locus facilitate a balanced SPI2 virulence gene transcription that is essential for Salmonella<pathogen><disease> pathogenesis.
