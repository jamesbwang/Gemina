 Infants with congenital diarrheal disorders caused by enteroendocrine cell dysgenesis , or the loss of intestinal endocrine cells , by itself causes severe malabsorptive diarrhea<disease><symptom> though the mechanism is unknown. The transcription factor ` Aristaless-related homeobox ' ( Arx) , is specifically expressed in intestinal endocrine cells. This study seeks to characterize the early malabsorptive phenotype of mice deficient for Arx using cell-type specific gene ablation in Villin-Cre; Arx
