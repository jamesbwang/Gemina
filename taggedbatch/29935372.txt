 Neuregulin 1 ( NRG1) , a ligand for HER3 and HER4 receptors , is secreted by both pancreatic tumor cells ( PC) and cancer-associated fibroblasts ( CAFs) , the latter representing the most abundant compound of pancreatic stroma. This desmoplastic stroma contributes to Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma ( PDAC) aggressiveness and therapeutic failure by promoting tumor progression , invasion and resistance to chemotherapies. In the present work , we aimed at disrupting the complex crosstalk between PC and CAF in order to prevent tumor cell proliferation. To do so , we demonstrated the promising tumor growth inhibitory effect of the 7E3 , an original antibody directed to NRG1. This antibody promotes antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity in NRG1-positive PC and CAFs and inhibits NRG1-associated signaling pathway induction , by blocking NRG1-mediated HER3 activation. Moreover , 7E3 inhibits migration and growth of pancreatic cancer cells co-cultured with CAFs , both in vitro and in vivo using orthotopic pancreatic tumor xenografts. Our preclinical results demonstrate that the anti-NRG1 antibody 7E3 could represent a promising approach to target pancreatic stroma and cancer cells , thereby providing novel therapeutic options for PDAC.
