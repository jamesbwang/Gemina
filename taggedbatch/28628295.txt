 New types of air filter technologies are being called because air pollution by particulate matters ( PMs) and volatile organic compounds has raised serious concerns for public health. Conventional air filters have limited application and poor degradability and they become non-disposable wastes after use. Here , we report a highly efficient , eco-friendly , translucent , and multifunctional air purification filter that is highly effective for reducing air pollution , protecting the environment , and detecting hazardous chemical vapors encountered in everyday life. Uniform silk protein nanofibers were directly generated on a window screen by an electrospinning process. Optical properties ( translucence and scattering) of the silk nanofibrous air filters ( SNAFs) are advantageous for achieving viewability and controlling the room temperature. Air filtration efficiencies of the fabricated SNAFs could reach up to 90 % and 97 % for PMs with sizes under 2.5 and 10 Î¼m , respectively , exceeding the performances of commercial semi-high-efficiency particulate air ( semi-HEPA) filters. After use , the SNAFs could be naturally degraded. Furthermore , we demonstrate the ability of SNAFs impregnated with organic dyes to sense hazardous and volatile vapors encountered in everyday life.
