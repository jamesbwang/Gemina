 Intermolecular hydrogen bonds play a crucial role in determining the unique characteristics of liquid water. We present low-frequency ( 1 Hz-40 MHz) dielectric spectroscopic investigations on water in the presence and absence of added solutes at different temperatures from 10 °C to 60 °C. The intersection points of temperature dependent permittivity contours at the vicinity of isopermitive frequency ( IPF) in water are recorded and its properties are presumed to be related to the extent of hydrogen bond networks in water. IPF is defined as the frequency at which the relative permittivity of water is almost independent of temperature. The set of intersection points of temperature dependent permittivity contours at the vicinity of IPF are characterized by the mean ( Formula: see text) and root-mean-square deviation/standard deviation ( Formula: see text) associated with IPF. The tunability of M
