 The present study was conducted to investigate the influence of rehydration with diluted sports drink and water gargling on salivary flow , pH and buffering capacity during exercise. Nineteen participants performed a 30-min bicycle ergometer exercise at 80 % of maximal heart rate while consuming a sports drink , followed by gargling with water , or no gargling , immediately after the exercise ( Exp. 1). The same experiment was then conducted on 9 participants who drank 1.5-fold diluted sports drink ( Exp. 2-A) and 10 who drank 2-fold diluted sports drink ( Exp. 2-B). Paraffin-stimulated whole saliva samples were collected for 3 min before , during and after exercise , and salivary parameters were examined using a hand-held pH meter. Statistical significance was assessed using multi-factor ANOVA and Turkey-Kramer test ( P < 0.05). The decrease in salivary pH was significantly suppressed after water gargling in Exp. 1 ( P < 0.01) and Exp. 2-A ( P < 0.001). Dilution of the sports drink had an interactive effect with water gargling in Exp. 2-B ( P < 0.01). These results suggest that gargling with water suppresses the decrease of salivary pH resulting from sports drink rehydration during ergometer exercise , but that this effect may be lost if athletes consume sports drink that has been diluted 2-fold with water.
