 To investigate the risk of all-cause mortality , recurrent VTE , and hospitalized bleeding in patients with VTE treated with either rivaroxaban or apixaban. Using Danish nationwide registries , patients with VTE treated with rivaroxaban or apixaban in the period from January 1st 2015 to June 30th 2017 were identified. Standardized absolute risks were estimated based on outcome-specific Cox regression models , adjusted for potential confounders. A total of 8,187 patients were included in the study , of which 1,504 ( 18 %) were treated with apixaban ( 50 % males , median age 70 years; inter quartile range ( IQR) 56-80) and 6,683 ( 82 %) were treated with rivaroxaban ( 55 % males , median age 67 years; IQR 53-76). The 180 days risk of all-cause mortality was 5.08 % ( 95 % CI: 4.08 % to 6.08 %) in the apixaban group and 4.60 % ( 95 % CI: 4.13 % to 5.18 %) in the rivaroxaban group ( absolute risk difference: -0.48 % ( 95 % CI: -1.49 % to 0.72 %) The 180 days risk of recurrent VTE was 2.16 % ( 95 % CI: 1.49 % to 2.88 %) in the apixaban group and 2.22 % ( 95 % CI: 1.89 % to 2.52 %) in the rivaroxaban group ( absolute risk difference of 0.06 % ( 95 % CI: -0.72 % to 0.79 %)). The 180 days risk of hospitalized bleeding was 1.73 % ( 95 % CI: 1.22 % to 2.35 %) for patients in the apixaban group and 1.89 % ( 95 % CI: 1.56 % to 2.20 %) in the rivaroxaban group ( absolute risk difference: 0.16 % ( 95 % CI: -0.59 % to 0.81 %)). In a nationwide cohort of 8,187 patients with VTE treated with rivaroxaban or apixaban there were no significant differences in the risks of all-cause mortality , recurrent VTE , or hospitalized bleeding.
