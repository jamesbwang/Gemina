 Sapheno femoral junctional tributaries are usually left untreated at the time of endovenous ablation of axial vein. The long-term clinical significance of these untreated tributaries remains elusive and there is very little research done into this area. This article reviews the fate of untreated tributaries at sapheno femoral junction following ablation of incompetent axial vein. A literature search and analysis of evidence reveal that the junctional tributaries are one of the commonest ( ranges between 8 % and 31 %) cause for recurrence following endovenous ablation of the axial veins. Follow up of this subset of patients after their axial vein treatment should be considered to identify neoreflux in side branches at sapheno femoral junction and plan treatment.
