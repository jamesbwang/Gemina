 Breast cancer survivors who carry a genetic mutation for one of the BRCA genes often undergo surgically-induced menopause a decade or more before the usual age of natural menopause. These women are at elevated risk for multiple negative health outcomes , including metabolic diseases , heart disease , and cancer recurrence. Effects of a 12-month commercially available web-based lifestyle program ( Precision Nutrition) were tested on body composition and markers of inflammation<symptom> in a randomized controlled trial. Participants ( N = 35) were BRCA1/2 + , breast cancer survivors , and had completed surgically-induced menopause at age < 45 years. DXA was used to quantify body composition. Fasting blood samples were used to assay insulin , IL1β , IL6 , IL8 , and TNFα. At baseline , we observed relationships between insulin , TNFα , and IL6 , and between biomarkers and adiposity. Insulin and subcutaneous adipose tissue levels significantly decreased following the intervention compared to the change in the control group. Compared to baseline , TNFα and total adipose tissue levels decreased significantly in the intervention group. The percent change in insulin levels was moderately correlated with the percent change in subcutaneous adipose tissue ( r = 0.33). Change in adiposity was not related to change in TNFα or IL6. Women in the intervention group decreased levels of subcutaneous , but not visceral , adipose tissue. The change in subcutaneous adipose tissue was the main driver of change in insulin levels for the women in the intervention group. However , the change in body composition achieved by the Precision Nutrition program was not sufficient to alter biomarker levels of inflammation<symptom>.
