 A massive deletion over three exons 16-17b in the CFTR gene was identified in Japanese CF patients with the highest frequency ( about 70 % of Japanese CF patients definitely diagnosed). This pathogenic mutation results in a deletion of 153 amino acids from glycine at position 970 ( G970) to threonine at 1122 ( T1122) in the CFTR protein without a frameshift. We name it Δ ( G970-T1122)- CFTR. In the present study , we characterized the Δ ( G970-T1122)- CFTR expressed in CHO cells using immunoblots and a super resolution microscopy. Δ ( G970-T1122)- CFTR proteins were synthesized and core-glycosylated but not complex-glycosylated. This observation suggests that the Δ ( G970-T1122) mutation can be categorized into the class II mutation like ΔF508. However , VX-809 a CFTR corrector that can help maturation of ΔF508 , had no effect on Δ ( G970-T1122). Interestingly C-terminal FLAG tag seems to partially rescue the trafficking defect of Δ ( G970-T1122)- CFTR; however the rescued Δ ( G970-T1122)- CFTR proteins do not assume channel function. Japanese , and perhaps people in other Asian nations , carry a class II mutation Δ ( G970-T1122) with a higher frequency than previously appreciated. Further study of the Δ ( G970-T1122)- CFTR is essential for understanding CF and CFTR-related diseases particularly in Asian countries.
