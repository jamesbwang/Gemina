 Despite abundant research into the neurobiology of mental disorders , to date neurobiological insights have had very little impact on psychiatric diagnosis or treatment. In this review , we contend that the search for neuroimaging biomarkers-neuromarkers-of mental disorders is a highly promising avenue toward improved psychiatric healthcare. However , many of the traditional tools used for psychiatric neuroimaging are inadequate for the identification of neuromarkers. Specifically , we highlight the need for larger samples and for multivariate analysis. Approaches such as machine learning are likely to be beneficial for interrogating high-dimensional neuroimaging data. We suggest that broad , population-based study designs will be important for developing neuromarkers of mental disorders , and will facilitate a move away from a phenomenological definition of mental disorder categories and toward psychiatric nosology based on biological evidence. We provide an outline of how the development of neuromarkers should occur , emphasizing the need for tests of external and construct validity , and for collaborative research efforts. Finally , we highlight some concerns regarding the development , and use of , neuromarkers in psychiatric healthcare.
