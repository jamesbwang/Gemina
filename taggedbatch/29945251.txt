 To examine the impact of transmitted drug resistance ( TDR) on response to first-line regimens with integrase strand transfer inhibitors ( INSTIs) or boosted protease inhibitors ( bPIs). From an Italian observational database ( ARCA) we selected HIV-1-infected drug-naive patients starting two NRTIs and either an INSTI or a bPI , with an available pre-ART resistance genotype. The endpoint was virological failure ( VF; plasma HIV-1 RNA > 200 copies/mL after week 24). WHO surveillance drug resistance mutations and the Stanford algorithm were used to classify patients into three resistance categories: no TDR ( A) , TDR but fully-active ART prescribed ( B) , TDR and at least low-level resistance to one or more prescribed drug ( C). We included 1365 patients with a median follow-up of 96 weeks ( IQR 54-110): 1205 ( 88.3 %) starting bPI and 160 ( 11.7 %) INSTI. Prevalence of TDR was 6.1 % , 12.5 % , 2.6 % and 0 % for NRTI , NNRTI , bPI and INSTI , respectively. Cumulative Kaplan-Meier estimates for VF at 48 weeks were 11 % ( 95 % CI 10.1 % -11.9 %) for the bPI group and 7.7 % ( 95 % CI 5.4 % -10 %) for the INSTI group. In the INSTI group , cumulative estimates for VF at 48 weeks were 6 % ( 95 % CI 4 % -8 %) in resistance category A , 5 % ( 95 % CI 1 % -10 %) in B and 50 % ( 95 % CI 30 % -70 %) in C ( P < 0.001). Resistance category C ( versus A , adjusted hazard ratio ( aHR) 12.6 , 95 % CI 3.2-49.8 , P < 0.001) and nadir CD4 ( +100 cells/mm3 , aHR 0.6 , 95 % CI 0.4-0.9 , P = 0.03) predicted VF. In the bPI group , VF rates were not influenced by baseline resistance. Our data support the need for NRTI resistance genotyping in patients starting an INSTI-based first-line ART.
