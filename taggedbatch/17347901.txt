 Segmental colitis<disease> associated with diverticulosis ( SCAD) is manifested by active chronic inflammation<symptom> of the colonic segments affected by diverticulosis , luminal-mucosal inflammation<symptom> , independent of the presence of inflammation<symptom> within and/or around the diverticula , and it usually spares the rectum. We present the case of a 15-year-old female admitted to our clinic due to lower digestive hemorrhage<symptom> and abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> in the previous week , associated with fever<symptom> 1 day prior to admission. The patient had pallor , painful abdomen upon palpation , accelerated bowel movements , and macroscopic evidence of blood in the stools<symptom>. Initial laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia , thrombocytosis , anemia<symptom> , and elevated inflammatory biomarkers. Moreover , colonoscopy revealed multiple ulcerations , hemorrhage<symptom> , and edema<symptom> of the sigmoid colon; however , multiple orifices raised the suspicion of a colonic diverticulosis and this was later on confirmed through a barium enema. The histopathological examination pointed out signs of an active chronic inflammation<symptom> and mucosal architectural changes associated with crypt abscesses<symptom> , therefore suggesting the diagnosis of SCAD. The patient 's prognosis was favorable; her condition improved following steroid and 5-aminosalicylate therapy , without any symptoms or recurrences at the 4 months follow-up. In conclusion , SCAD is a very rare disease entity that is usually confused with other inflammatory bowel conditions. Moreover , it has not been reported in the pediatric age group until now.
