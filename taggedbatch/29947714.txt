 To evaluate lung function and inspiratory muscle strength , correlating them with exercise tolerance , in obese individuals with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome<disease><symptom> ( OSAS). The sample comprised 31 adult subjects with moderate-to-severe OSAS diagnosed by polysomnography. We used spirometry to measure FVC , FEV1 , and FVC/FEV1 ratio , using pressure manometry to measure MIP and MEP. The incremental shuttle walk test ( ISWT) and the six-minute walk test ( 6MWT) were used in order to determine functional exercise capacity. In this sample , the mean values for FVC ( % of predicted) , FEV1 ( % of predicted): MIP , and MEP were 76.4 ± 12.3 % , 80.1 ± 6.3 % , 60.0 ± 21.9 cmH2O , and 81.3 ± 22.2 cmH2O , respectively. The mean distances covered on the ISWT and 6MWT were 221 ± 97 m and 480.8 ± 67.3 m , respectively. The ISWT distance showed moderate positive correlations with FVC ( r = 0.658; p = 0.001) and FEV1 ( r = 0.522; p = 0.003). In this sample of obese subjects with untreated OSAS , lung function , inspiratory muscle strength , and exercise tolerance were all below normal. In addition , we found that a decline in lung function , but not in respiratory<symptom> muscle strength , was associated with exercise tolerance in these patients.
