 OBJECTIVE Advances in endovascular therapy for the treatment of middle cerebral artery ( MCA) aneurysms<disease> have led to scrutiny of its benefits compared with microsurgical repair. To provide information regarding complication rates and outcomes , the authors reviewed the results of a large series of unruptured MCA aneurysms<disease> treated with open microsurgery. METHODS The authors included all patients who underwent surgical repair of an unruptured MCA aneurysm<disease> between 1997 and 2015. All surgical procedures , including clipping , wrapping , bypass , and parent artery occlusion , were performed by a single neurosurgeon. Aneurysm<disease> occlusion was assessed using intraoperative digital subtraction angiography ( DSA) or DSA and indocyanine green videoangiography in all cases. Postoperatively , all patients were monitored in a neurointensive care unit overnight. Clinical follow-up was scheduled for 2-4 weeks after surgery , and angiographic follow-up was performed in those patients with subtotally occluded aneurysms<disease> at 1 , 2 , and 5 years postoperation. RESULTS The authors treated 750 unruptured MCA aneurysms<disease> in 716 patients: 649 ( 86.5 %) aneurysms<disease> were small , 75 ( 10.0 %) were large , and 26 ( 3.5 %) were giant. Most aneurysms<disease> ( n = 677 , 90 %) were treated by primary clip reconstruction. The surgical morbidity rate was 2.8 % , and the mortality rate was 0 %. Complete angiographic aneurysm<disease> occlusion was achieved in 92.0 % of aneurysms<disease>. At final follow-up , 713 patients had a modified Rankin Scale ( mRS) score of 0 , 2 patients had an mRS score of 2 or 3 , and 1 had an mRS score of 4. CONCLUSIONS In high-volume centers , microsurgical management of MCA aneurysms<disease> can be performed with very low morbidity rates. Currently , microsurgical repair appears to be a highly effective method of treating MCA aneurysms<disease>.
