 ( Purpose) This study aimed to evaluate the effect of body<symptom> weight support with an assistive device on predicted locomotive physical activity measured using triaxial accelerometers in healthy young subjects. ( Subjects and Methods) Sixteen healthy subjects aged 21.9 Â± 1.1 years walked on a treadmill at speeds of 45 and 55 meters/min under 0 % , 10 % , 20 % , and 30 % body<symptom> weight support conditions. Predicted metabolic equivalents and number of steps were evaluated using triaxial accelerometers. Measured metabolic equivalents and number of steps were evaluated using a metabolic system and observers , respectively. Raw data of synthetic accelerations were also obtained. ( Results) Predicted metabolic equivalents and number of steps and raw data of synthetic accelerations decreased with increasing amounts of body<symptom> weight support. ( Conclusion) These findings suggest that accelerometers may underestimate locomotive physical activity with increasing amounts of body<symptom> weight support using assistive devices. Thus , it is important to consider the amount of body<symptom> weight support when assessing physical activities in subjects using assistive devices for mobility.
