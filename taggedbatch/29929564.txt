 The present study aimed to estimate heritability of Hwabyung ( HB) symptoms in adolescent and young adult twins in South Korea. The sample included 1,601 twins consisting of 143 pairs of monozygotic male ( MZM) , 67 pairs of dizygotic male ( DZM) , 295 pairs of monozygotic female ( MZF) , 114 pairs of dizygotic female ( DZF) , and 117 pairs of opposite-sex dizygotic ( OSDZ) twins and 129 twins with non-participating co-twins ( mean age = 19.1 Â± 3.1 years; range: 12-29 years). An HB symptom questionnaire was given to twins via a telephone interview. Consistent with the literature of HB , the mean level of HB was significantly higher in females than in males. Maximum likelihood twin correlations for HB were 0.31 ( 95 % CI ( 0.16 , 0.45)) for MZM , 0.19 ( 95 % CI ( -0.05 , 0.41)) for DZM , 0.50 ( 95 % CI ( 0.41 , 0.58)) for MZF , 0.28 ( 95 % CI ( 0.11 , 0.44)) for DZF , and 0.23 ( 95 % CI ( 0.05 , 0.40)) for OSDZ twins. These patterns of twin correlations suggested the presence of additive genetic influences on HB. Model-fitting analysis showed that additive genetic and individual-specific environmental influences on HB were 44 % ( 95 % CI ( 37 , 51)) and 56 % ( 95 % CI ( 49 , 63)) , respectively. Shared environmental influences were not significant. These parameter estimates were not significantly different between two sexes , and did not change significantly with age in the present sample , suggesting that genetic and environmental influences on HB in both sexes are stable across adolescence and young adulthood.
