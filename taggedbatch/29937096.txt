 The ductus arteriosus is typically viewed as a mammalian fetal blood vessel providing a right-to-left shunt of right ventricular outflow away from the lungs and to the systemic circuit , that must close at birth. This review provides a wider comparative examination of the ductus arteriosus in lungfish , reptiles , birds , and mammals. The ductus arteriosus evolved with the lung in the ancestors of the lungfish as a connection between the pulmonary arteries and dorsal aorta. During embryonic development , reptiles , birds , and mammals all possess either one or two paired ductus arteriosi that provide a fetal shunt of blood away from the lungs. Differences in the fetal circulatory arrangement are seen between these groups and this influences the importance of the ductus arteriosus as an embryonic shunt. The ductus arteriosus from lungfish and tetrapod vertebrates is an oxygen sensitive blood vessel , with shared conserved pathways involved in oxygen sensing. By expanding studies into more comparative models such as lungfish or developing birds a better understanding of the physiology of the ductus arteriosus can be developed.
