 Current pharmaceutical research and development ( R&D) is a high-risk investment which is usually faced with some unexpected even disastrous failures in different stages of drug discovery. One main reason for R&D failures is the efficacy and safety deficiencies which are related largely to absorption , distribution , metabolism and excretion ( ADME) properties and various toxicities ( T). Therefore , rapid ADMET evaluation is urgently needed to minimize failures in the drug discovery process. Here , we developed a web-based platform called ADMETlab for systematic ADMET evaluation of chemicals based on a comprehensively collected ADMET database consisting of 288,967 entries. Four function modules in the platform enable users to conveniently perform six types of drug-likeness analysis ( five rules and one prediction model) , 31 ADMET endpoints prediction ( basic property: 3 , absorption: 6 , distribution: 3 , metabolism: 10 , elimination: 2 , toxicity: 7) , systematic evaluation and database/similarity searching. We believe that this web platform will hopefully facilitate the drug discovery process by enabling early drug-likeness evaluation , rapid ADMET virtual screening or filtering and prioritization of chemical structures. The ADMETlab web platform is designed based on the Django framework in Python , and is freely accessible at http://admet.scbdd.com/.
