 Risk assessments of toxicants in aquatic environments are typically based on the evaluation of concentrations in water or sediment. However , concentrations in water are highly variable , while the body burden may provide a better time-integrated measure of pesticide exposure and potential effects in aquatic organisms. Here , we quantified pesticide body burdens in a dominant invertebrate species from agricultural streams , Gammarus pulex , compared them with pesticide concentrations in water samples , and linked the pesticide contamination with observed ecological effects on macroinvertebrate communities. In total , 19 of 61 targeted analytes were found in the organisms , ranging from 0.037 to 93.94 ng g
