 To analyze the marginal adaptation of computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufactured ( CAD/CAM) porcelain laminate veneers. A total of 25 three-dimensional ( 3D) machine-milled laminate veneers were divided into five groups of five each according to fabrication material ( E-max; Empress; Lava Ultimate; Suprinity; and Vita Mark II) and cemented in 25 prepared acrylic central incisors. Digital microscopy images ( × 7.5 magnification) were analyzed for gaps in the mesial/distal surfaces of the prepared tooth and in the cervical , medial , and incisal thirds. All CAD/CAM laminate veneers except for Empress and Suprinity in the middle and incisal thirds showed good results ( ie , gaps < 120 μm in the cervical , middle , and incisal thirds).
