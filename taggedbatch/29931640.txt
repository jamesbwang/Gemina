 Tannin extracts from the bark of Acacia mearnsii and wood of Schinopsis balansae , commonly known as Quebracho , were employed. These were modified at laboratory sale via the Mannich aminomethylation with formaldehyde and dimethylamine hydrochloride. Some reaction conditions were varied , namely the formaldehyde dosage and reaction time , while keeping the Mannich solution activation time constant , and their influence on the shear viscosity of the created bio-coagulants was evaluated. The effect of the final pH of the products on their shear viscosity was also analyzed. Up-scaling of the Mannich reaction for tannin from South Africa was performed and the procedure developed at 1-L scale was reproducible in upscaled conditions. One example of a modified South Africa tannin and the modified Quebracho tannin was subsequently selected for the treatment of an industrial wastewater and tested for color and turbidity reduction in jar tests. The effluent treatment was carried out in a single and dual system with cationic synthetic flocculation agents of different charge degree. Good turbidity and decoloration results ( 93 and 89 % reduction , respectively) were obtained with the simultaneous introduction of a cationic , 40 % charged polyacrylamide , with minimal dosage ( 5 ppm) of the latter additive. The tannin-based coagulant from Acacia mearnsii was successfully applied in dual system with cationic polyacrylamide flocculant for industrial wastewater treatment at pilot plant scale. It was shown to satisfactorily treat the water and generate less sludge.
