 Cellular senescence , that is , the withdrawal from the cell cycle , combined with the acquirement of the senescence associated secretory phenotype has important roles during health and disease and is essential for tissue remodeling during embryonic development. Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells , responsible for bone resorption , and cell cycle arrest during osteoclastogenesis is well recognized. Therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate whether these cells should be considered senescent and to assess the influence of hypoxia on their potential senescence status. Osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption capacity of osteoclasts , cultured from CD14 + monocytes , were evaluated in two oxygen concentrations , normoxia ( 21 % O
