 Background and aims Epidemiological data have suggested that the prevalence of co-occurring personality disorders is particularly high in people with gambling disorder ( GD). Among the personality disorders , obsessive-compulsive personality disorder ( OCPD) appears to be the most common problem. The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical presentation of GD with and without co-occurring OCPD. Methods We studied 25 subjects with current GD and lifetime diagnosis of OCPD. They were matched for age and gender with 25 individuals with current GD but no lifetime diagnosis of any personality disorder. Results Subjects with GD and OCPD demonstrated ( a) lower severity of gambling symptoms , ( b) slower progression from recreational gambling to full-blown GD , ( c) preferred individual forms of betting , ( d) identified more triggers to gambling ( specially the availability of money and stress); and ( e) reported less negative impact on relational problems due to GD. Conclusions Our research provides further insight on GD co-occurring with OCPD , such as increasing social support and improvement of coping skills , especially to deal with financial difficulties and stress. Our findings may lead to more customized and effective therapeutic approaches to this frequent comorbidity.
