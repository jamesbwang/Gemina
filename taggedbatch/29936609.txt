 Oncogenic viruses carry an extensive arsenal of oncogenes for hijacking cellular pathways. Notably , variations in oncogenes among tumor-producing viruses give rise to different mechanisms for cellular transformation. Specifically , Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus<pathogen> ( KSHV) is an oncogenic virus able to infect and transform a variety of cell types. The oncogenicity of KSHV disseminates from the virus ' ability to induce and encode a wide variety of both cellular and viral oncogenes. Such an array of cellular and viral oncogenes enables KSHV to induce the malignant phenotype of a KSHV-associated cancer. Evolutionarily , KSHV has acquired many oncogenic homologues capable of inducing cell proliferation , cell differentiation , cell survival , and immune evasion. Integration between inducing and encoding oncogenes plays a vital role in KSHV pathogenicity. KSHV is alleged to harbor the highest number of potential oncogenes by which a virus promotes cellular transformation and malignancy. Many KSHV inducing/encoding oncogenes are mainly expressed during the latent phase of KSHV infection , a period required for virus establishment of malignant cellular transformation. Elucidation of the exact mechanism ( s) by which oncogenes promote KSHV pathogenicity would not only give rise to potential novel therapeutic targets/drugs but would also add to our understanding of cancer biology. The scope of this review is to examine the roles of the most important cellular and viral oncogenes involved in KSHV pathogenicity.
