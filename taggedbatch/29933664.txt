 Endometrial receptivity refers to the ability of endometrium to accept and accommodate endometrial implantation in the process of embryo implantation in implantation window period. It is an important factor affecting the rate of blastocyst implantation in assisted reproduction. It is worth mentioning that ovulation-promoting drugs in current assisted reproduction technology could reduce endometrial receptivity and inhibit blastocyst implantation , greatly affecting the success rate of assisted reproduction. By searching Chinese Scientific Citation Database , it was found that 121 studies from 2006 to 2017 showed that Chinese Bushen Huoxue prescriptions could significantly improve the development of pinopodes in the implantation window , promote the expression of endometrial receptors ER , PR , integrinÎ²3 , LIF , LPA3 and other molecules , and thus enhancing endometrial receptivity and improving embryo implantation. In the theory of traditional Chinese medicine , kidney deficiency is an important factor causing infertility<symptom>. Chinese Bushen Huoxue prescriptions could nourish the kidney-essence , and promote blood circulation , playing an important role in treating infertility<symptom> with combined application of western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine. These studies suggest that Chinese Bushen Huoxue prescriptions could improve endometrial receptivity , and their mechanisms are worth further investigation. This article has summarized the research progress of Chinese Bushen Huoxue prescriptions in the field of assisted reproduction , summarized the deficiency of current researches , and preliminarily discussed the potential application prospect of Chinese Bushen Huoxue prescriptions in the treatment of infertility<symptom>.
