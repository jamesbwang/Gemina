 To review and compare treatments ( 1) after primary traumatic shoulder dislocation aimed at minimising the risk of chronic shoulder instability and ( 2) for chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability. Intervention systematic review with random effects network meta-analysis and direct comparison meta-analyses. Electronic databases ( Ovid MEDLINE , Cochrane Clinical Trials Register , Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews , Embase , Scopus , CINAHL , Ovid MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print , In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations , Ovid MEDLINE Daily , DARE , HTA , NHSEED , Web of Science) and reference lists were searched from inception to 15 January 2018. Randomised trials comparing any interventions either after a first-time , traumatic shoulder dislocation or chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability , with a shoulder instability , function or quality of life outcome. Twenty-two randomised controlled trials were included. There was moderate quality evidence suggesting that labrum repair reduced the risk of future shoulder dislocation ( relative risk 0.15; 95 % CI 0.03 to 0.8 , p = 0.026) , and that with non-surgical management 47 % of patients did not experience shoulder redislocation. Very low<symptom> to low-quality evidence suggested no benefit of immobilisation in external rotation versus internal rotation. There was low-quality evidence that an open procedure was superior to arthroscopic surgery for preventing shoulder redislocations. There was moderate-quality evidence that half of the patients managed with physiotherapy after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation did not experience recurrent shoulder dislocations. If chronic instability develops , surgery could be considered. There was no evidence regarding the effectiveness of surgical management for post-traumatic chronic shoulder instability.
