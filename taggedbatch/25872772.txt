 Warfarin is the most recommended anticoagulant drug for patients undergoing heart valve replacement. However , due to the narrow therapeutic window and individual dose , the use of warfarin needs more advanced technology. We used the data collected from a multi-central registered clinical system all over China about the patients who have undergone heart valve replacement , subsequently divided into three groups ( training group: 10673 cases; internal validation group: 3558 cases; external validation group: 1463 cases) in order to construct a hybrid model with genetic algorithm and Back-Propagation neural network ( BP-GA) , For testing the model 's prediction accuracy , we used Mean absolute error ( MAE) , Root mean squared error ( RMSE) and the ideal predicted percentage of total and dose subgroups. In results , whether in internal or in external validation group , the total ideal predicted percentage was over 58 % while the intermediate dose subgroup manifested the best. Moreover , it showed higher prediction accuracy , lower MAE value and lower RMSE value in the external validation group than that in the internal validation group ( p < 0.05). In conclusion , BP-GA model is promising to predict warfarin maintenance dose.
