 To assess differences in cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality in classic cardiopulmonary resuscitation versus extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation events using video recordings of actual pediatric cardiac arrest events. Single-center , prospective , observational trial. Tertiary-care pediatric teaching hospital , cardiac ICU. All patients admitted to the pediatric cardiac ICU with cardiopulmonary resuscitation events lasting greater than 2 minutes captured on video. None. Seventeen events comprising 264.5 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation were included: 11 classic cardiopulmonary resuscitation events ( 87.5 min) and six extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation events ( 177 min). Events were divided into 30-second epochs , and cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality markers were assessed using video and telemetry data review of goal endpoints: end-tidal carbon dioxide greater than or equal to 15 mm Hg , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg , chest compression fraction greater than 80 % per epoch , and chest compression rate between 100 and 120 chest compression per minute. Additionally , each chest compression pause ( hands-off event) was recorded and timed. When compared with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation , classic cardiopulmonary resuscitation epochs were more likely to have end-tidal carbon dioxide greater than or equal to 15 mm Hg ( 56 % vs 6.2 %; p = 0.01) and provide chest compression between 100 and 120 times per minute ( 112 vs 134 chest compression per minute; p < 0.001). No difference was found between classic cardiopulmonary resuscitation and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in compliance with diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg ( 38 % classic cardiopulmonary resuscitation vs 30 % extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation). There were 135 hands-off events: 52 in classic cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 83 in extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( p = 0.12). Classic cardiopulmonary resuscitation had superior adherence to end-tidal carbon dioxide goals and chest compression rate guidelines than extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
