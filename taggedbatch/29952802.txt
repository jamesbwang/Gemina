 We present a time-series analysis of shear-mediated platelet activation ( SMPA) in a patient supported by a left ventricular assist device ( LVAD) who developed recurrent thromboembolic events over the course of support. The patient showed marked alterations of SMPA as quantified via the platelet activity state ( PAS) assay. At the time of a first pump thrombosis , PAS was equal to 16.2 ± 2.1 % , indicating a significant level of SMPA. A moderate decrease of PAS was observed 30 days after pump exchange ( PAS = 9.5 ± 1.0 %). A sudden PAS increase was recorded after 60 days ( PAS = 60.5 ± 4.3 %) , and an ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation was subsequently diagnosed at 120 days after pump exchange ( PAS = 86.9 ± 7.5 %); high PAS values did not recover over time likely because of sustained platelet activation from the inflammatory milieu caused by a driveline infection occurred at 240 days of support ( PAS = 84.4 ± 7.3 %). Platelet activity state values were completely reversed after heart transplantation ( PAS = 0.6 ± 0.1 %) , demonstrating resolution of SMPA. This study provides further insight into our understanding of the pathogenesis of LVAD thrombosis , addressing SMPA as a relevant key factor associated with thrombotic complications. With the PAS assay , we have identified a reliable biomarker to promote tailored pharmacological therapy for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with LVADs.
