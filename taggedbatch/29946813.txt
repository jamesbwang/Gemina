 Purpose To describe: ( i) patterns of self-employment and social welfare provisions for self-employed and salaried workers in several European countries; ( ii) work-related outcomes after cancer in self-employed people and to compare these with the work-related outcomes of salaried survivors within each sample; and ( iii) work-related outcomes for self-employed cancer survivors across countries. Methods Data from 11 samples from seven European countries were included. All samples had cross-sectional survey data on work outcomes in self-employed and salaried cancer survivors who were working at time of diagnosis ( n = 22-261 self-employed/101 -1871 salaried). The samples included different cancers and assessed different outcomes at different times post-diagnosis. Results Fewer self-employed cancer survivors took time off work due to cancer compared to salaried survivors. More self-employed than salaried survivors worked post-diagnosis in almost all countries. Among those working at the time of survey , self-employed survivors had made a larger reduction in working hours compared to pre-diagnosis , but they still worked more hours per week post-diagnosis than salaried survivors. The self-employed had received less financial compensation when absent from work post-cancer , and more self-employed , than salaried , survivors reported a negative financial change due to the cancer. There were differences between self-employed and salaried survivors in physical job demands , work ability and quality-of-life but the direction and magnitude of the differences differed across countries. Conclusion Despite sample differences , self-employed survivors more often continued working during treatment and had , in general , worse financial outcomes than salaried cancer survivors. Other work-related outcomes differed in different directions across countries.
