 RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq) has become the preferred method for global quantification of bacterial gene expression. With the continued improvements in sequencing technology and data analysis tools , the most labor-intensive and expensive part of an RNA-seq experiment is the preparation of sequencing libraries , which is also essential for the quality of the data obtained. Here , we present a straightforward and inexpensive basic protocol for preparation of strand-specific RNA-seq libraries from bacterial RNA as well as a computational pipeline for the data analysis of sequencing reads. The protocol is based on the Illumina platform and allows easy multiplexing of samples and the removal of sequencing reads that are PCR duplicates. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
