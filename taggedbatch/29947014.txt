 In several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) , microglia are hyperactivated and release nitric oxide ( NO) and proinflammatory cytokines , resulting its neuropathology. Mounting evidence indicates that dietary supplementation with coconut oil ( CNO) reduces the cognitive deficits associated with AD; however , the precise mechanism ( s) underlying the beneficial effect of CNO are unknown. In the present study , we examined the effects of lauric acid ( LA) , a major constituent of CNO , on microglia activated experimentally by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) , using primary cultured rat microglia and the mouse microglial cell line , BV-2. LA attenuated LPS-stimulated NO production and the expression of inducible NO synthase protein without affecting cell viability. In addition , LA suppressed LPS-induced reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokine production , as well as phosphorylation of p38-mitogen activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. LA-induced suppression of NO production was partially but significantly reversed in the presence of GW1100 , an antagonist of G protein-coupled receptor ( GPR) 40 , which is an LA receptor on the plasma membrane. LA also decreased LPS-induced phagocytosis , which was completely reversed by co-treatment with GW1100. Moreover , LA alleviated amyloid-Î²-induced enhancement of phagocytosis. These results suggest that attenuation of microglial activation by LA may occur via the GPR40-dependent pathway. Such effects of LA may reduce glial activation and the subsequent neuronal damage in AD patients who consume CNO.
