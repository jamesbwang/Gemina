 The structural complexity of lignocellulose offers unique opportunities for the development of entirely new , energy efficient and waste-free pathways in order to obtain valuable bio-based building blocks. Such sustainable catalytic methods- specifically tailored to address the efficient conversion of abundant renewable starting materials- are necessary to successfully compete , in the future , with fossil-based multi-step processes. In this contribution we give a summary of recent developments in this field and describe our `` cleave and couple '' strategy , where `` cleave '' refers to the catalytic deconstruction of lignocellulose to aromatic and aliphatic alcohol intermediates , and `` couple '' involves the development of novel , sustainable transformations for the formation of C-C and C-N bonds in order to obtain a range of attractive products from lignocellulose.
