 Food craving has been shown to induce states of psychological challenge , indexed by increases in adrenaline but not cortisol production. The study aimed to test the relationship between challenge and ( 1) desire thinking ( the active processing of the pleasant consequences of achieving a desired target and planning how to do so) and ( 2) craving. Participants ( N = 61) self-reported their levels of craving and desire thinking. They were then presented with situations in which their craving would be fulfilled or not via a false feedback practice task ( a wordsearch task). During this period psycho-physiological measures of challenge and threat were taken. Higher levels of craving were linked to challenge only when the craved object was likely to be obtained. Whilst anticipating reward fulfillment , higher levels of craving were linked to higher levels of desire thinking. In turn , higher levels of desire thinking were related to lower levels of challenge. In contrast , during the processes of reward fulfillment , desire thinking was linked to increased challenge ( i.e. , a positive indirect effect). Craving is linked to increased levels of psychological challenge when the object of the craving can be obtained , but it is unrelated to craving when it is not. The research also highlights the importance of desire thinking as an important , but complex , mediator in the relationship between craving and motivational states: desire thinking inhibited challenge when anticipating craving fulfillment , but encouraging it during the process of fulfillment itself.
