 Life Span psychological and life course sociological perspectives have long acknowledged that individual functioning is shaped by historical and sociocultural contexts. Secular increases favoring later-born cohorts are widely documented for fluid cognitive performance and well-being ( among older adults). However , little is known about secular trends in other key resources of psychosocial function such as perceptions of control and whether historical changes have occurred in young , middle-aged , and older adults alike. To examine these questions , we compared data from two independent national samples of the Midlife in the United States survey obtained 18 years apart ( 1995/96 vs. 2013/14) and identified case-matched cohorts ( per cohort , n = 2,223 , aged = 23-75 years) based on age and gender. We additionally examined the role of economic resources for cohort differences in perceived mastery and constraints. Results revealed that older adults in later-born cohorts reported perceiving fewer constraints than did matched controls 18 years ago , with such positive secular trends being particularly pronounced among women. In contrast , younger adults reported perceiving more constraints in later-born cohorts than those 18 years ago and also reported perceiving lower mastery. We conclude from our national U.S. sample that secular trends generalize to central psychosocial resources across adulthood , such as perceptions of control , but are not unanimously positive. We discuss possible underlying mechanisms and practical implications. ( PsycINFO Database Record
