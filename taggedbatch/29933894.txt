 The mortality rate of patients with hemodynamic<symptom> instability<symptom> due to severe pelvic fracture remains substantial and massive transfusion happens frequently. Angio-embolization , external fixation and preperitoneal pelvic packing of the pelvis are the main managements used to control bleeding in these patients. In this paper , we aimed at characterizing the rationale of these surgical managements , and placed them in optimal management algorithm to compose a new guideline. We selected controlled trials , assessing safety of management for the intervention of hemorrhagic shock<symptom> from mortality data , and assessing efficacy from volume of first 24 h blood transfusion following hospitalization. Six single and combined managements were extracted as comparison. A pairwise meta-analysis was conducted using a random effect model , and then the analysis was extended to a network meta-analysis. Pooled effect sizes were ranked and demonstrated the probability of being the best treatments for safety and efficacy. 13 clinical trials and 24,396 participants were identified for this analysis. The assessment of rank probability indicated that pelvic packing presented the greatest likelihood of improving safety , while external fixation was indicated most efficient among the interventions for controlling hemorrhage<symptom>. Clinical protocols for guidelines of hemodynamically unstable pelvic fracture patients have been multidirectionally developed. We strongly support the initial application of an external fixator. Provided that patients remain hemodynamically unstable after application of an external fixation , pelvic packing is the next procedure to consider. Angio-embolization is the complementary but not alternative method of choice subsequently.
