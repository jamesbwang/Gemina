 Motor thalamus ( Mthal) comprises the ventral anterior , ventral lateral , and ventral medial thalamic nuclei in rodents. This subcortical hub receives input from the basal ganglia ( BG) , cerebellum , and reticular thalamus in addition to connecting reciprocally with motor cortical regions. Despite the central location of Mthal , the mechanisms by which it influences movement remain unclear. To determine its role in generating ballistic , goal-directed movement , we recorded single-unit Mthal activity as male rats performed a two-alternative forced-choice task. A large population of Mthal neurons increased their firing briefly near movement initiation and could be segregated into functional groups based on their behavioral correlates. The activity of `` initiation '' units was more tightly locked to instructional cues than movement onset , did not predict which direction the rat would move , and was anticorrelated with reaction time ( RT). Conversely , the activity of `` execution '' units was more tightly locked to movement onset than instructional cues , predicted which direction the rat would move , and was anticorrelated with both RT and movement time. These results suggest that Mthal influences choice RT performance in two stages: short latency , nonspecific action initiation followed by action selection/invigoration. We discuss the implications of these results for models of motor control incorporating BG and cerebellar circuits.
