 High-flow nasal cannula ( HFNC) oxygen therapy may provide effective respiratory management of hypoxemic respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> in patients with interstitial lung disease ( ILD) with a do-not-intubate ( DNI) order. The aim was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of HFNC for these patients. We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients requesting a DNI order for hypoxemic respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> associated with ILD , comparing treatment with HFNC and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation ( NPPV). Outcomes measured were 30-day survival , in-hospital mortality , temporary interruption and discontinuation of the treatment at the patient 's request , adverse events , oral intake , and communication ability at the end of life. A total of 84 patients ( HFNC , n = 54; NPPV , n = 30) were analyzed. Neither 30-day survival ( HFNC 31.5 % vs. NPPV 30.0 %; p = 0.86) nor in-hospital mortality ( HFNC 79.6 % vs. NPPV 83.3 %; p = 0.78) differed significantly. The temporary interruption and discontinuation rates were significantly lower in the HFNC group than in the NPPV group ( 3.7 vs. 23.3 %; p = 0.009 and 0 vs. 10 %; p = 0.043 , respectively) , and that group had significantly fewer adverse events. Among patients who died in the hospital , those treated with HFNC had significantly better oral intake and ability to converse until just before death. HFNC had a survival rate equivalent to that of NPPV and was better tolerated by patients with hypoxemic respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> associated with ILD who had a DNI order. HFNC allowed patients to eat and converse until just before death , suggesting that HFNC in these patients is a reasonable palliative treatment.
