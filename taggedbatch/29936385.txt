 With the intent of enhancing the loading capacity and controlled the release of a low-water soluble drug ( quercetin) , 6 ar ms ( Poly-Ethylene-Glycol)- amine was grafted in the external surface of halloysite nanotubes. The grafted halloysite nanotubes ( HNTs-g-PEG) were decorated with carbon quantum dots for additive fluorescents properties. Conjointly , biotin was conjugated to PEG 's free amine groups for precise targeting of tumor tissue and higher cellular uptake. The obtained nanoparticles were characterized by the FTIR , TEM , XRD , zeta potential and TGA analysis. The photoluminescence ( PL) properties were investigated by firstly , observing under UV-light at 365 nm; then , the fluorescence spectra of modified HNTs at different levels of preparation were obtained and showed a suitable blue fluorescence. Furthermore , the fluorescent properties were demonstrated by the optical image of HNTs-g-PEG-CDs-Biotin obtained from the confocal microscope , which could be interesting for both in vitro and in vivo imaging. Besides , the prepared NPs showed a superior loading capacity of Que ( 278.36 mg/g) at optimal adsorption conditions comparing to pristine HNTs. The in vitro drug release from these NPs was relatively sustained and pH sensitive. The incubation of the prepared HNTs-g-PEG-CDs-Biotin NPs with HeLa cells showed a low toxicity and a suitable biocompatibility. The MTT assay of the Que-loaded NPs possesses enhanced antitumor activity over the free Que.
