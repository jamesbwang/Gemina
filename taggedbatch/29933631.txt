 Nanocellulose-modified presspaper is a promising solution to achieve cellulose insulation with better performance , reducing the risk of electrical insulation failures of a converter transformer. Predicting the dielectric properties will help to further design and improvement of presspaper. In this paper , a multivariable method was adopted to determine the effect of softwood fiber on the macroscopic performance of presspaper. Based on the parameters selected using the optimum subset method , a multiple linear regression was built to model the relationship between the fiber properties and insulating performance of presspaper. The results show that the fiber width and crystallinity had an obvious influence on the mechanical properties of presspaper , and fiber length , fines , lignin , and nanocellulose had a significant impact on the breakdown properties. The proposed models exhibit a prediction accuracy of higher than 90 % when verified with the experimental results. Finally , the effect of nanocellulose on the breakdown strength of presspaper was taken into account and new models were derived.
