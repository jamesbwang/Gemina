 Networked multiple sensors are used to solve the problem of maneuvering target tracking. To avoid the linearization of nonlinear dynamic functions , and to obtain more accurate estimates for maneuvering targets , a novel adaptive information-weighted consensus filter for maneuvering target tracking is proposed. The pseudo measurement matrix is computed with unscented transform to utilize the information form of measurements , which is necessary for consensus iterations. To improve the maneuvering target tracking accuracy and get a unified estimation in each sensor node across the entire network , the adaptive current statistical model is exploited to update the estimate , and the information-weighted consensus protocol is applied among neighboring nodes for each dynamic model. Based on posterior probabilities of multiple models , the final estimate of each sensor is acquired with weighted combination of model-conditioned estimates. Experimental results illustrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm with respect tracking accuracy and agreement of estimates in the whole network.
