 To evaluate cardiotoxicity in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 + ( HER2 +) breast cancer ( 29 left-sided , 23 right-sided) treated with adjuvant whole-breast hypofractionated radiotherapy ( HRT) concurrently administered with the humanized monoclonal antibody to HER2 , trastuzumab. From February 2008 to June 2017 , 52 patients received three-dimensional conformal RT , with different HRT schemes. Echocardiogram monitoring was used to evaluate the decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF). At a median follow-up of 5 years , cardiotoxicity was as follows: among the 15 patients treated with 46 Gy: grade ( G) 2 in two ( 13 %) , G1 in three ( 20 %) , and G0 in 10 ( 67 %); in those treated with 39 Gy ( 16 patients): G1 in five ( 31 %) , and G0 in 11 ( 69 %); among the 21 patients treated with 35 Gy: G2 in one ( 5 %) , G1 in five ( 24 %) , and G0 in 15 ( 71 %). Trastuzumab was shown to be a safe adjuvant treatment when administered with concomitant HRT since it did not increase cardiotoxicity in those with left-sided breast cancer. No differences in LVEF were observed between the HRT schemes.
