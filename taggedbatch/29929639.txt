 The aim of this study was to investigate medium-term outcomes in patients with leaflet thrombosis ( LT). The clinical significance of early LT after transcatheter aortic valve replacement , diagnosed by computed tomography angiography in approximately 10 % of patients , is uncertain. In this observational study , computed tomographic angiography was performed a median of 5 days after transcatheter aortic valve replacement and assessed for evidence of LT. Follow-up consisted of clinical visits , telephone contact , or questionnaire. LT was diagnosed in 120 of 754 patients ( 15.9 %). Patients with LT were less likely male ( 36.7 % vs. 47.0 % , p = 0.045) , with a lower rate of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( 28.3 % vs. 41.5 % , p = 0.008). Peri- and post-procedural characteristics were comparable between groups ( e.g. , valve implantation technique; p = 0.116). During a median follow-up period of 406 days , there were no significant differences in the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality and the secondary combined endpoint of stroke and transient ischemic attack between patients with LT and those without LT ( 18-month Kaplan-Meier estimate for mortality 86.6 % vs. 85.4 % , p = 0.912; for stroke- or transient ischemic attack-free survival 98.5 % vs. 96.8 % , p = 0.331). In univariate and multivariate analyses , LT was not predictive of either endpoint , whereas male sex ( p = 0.03) , atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( p = 0.002) , and more than mild paravalvular leak ( p = 0.015) were associated with all-cause mortality. In this prospective observational cohort undergoing post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement computed tomographic angiography , LT was not associated with increased mortality or rates of stroke over a follow-up period of 406 days.
