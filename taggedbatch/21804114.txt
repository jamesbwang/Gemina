 ( Purpose) To examine whether the needs of older individuals are commonly understood by multidisciplinary team members at elderly care facilities. ( Subjects and Methods) A questionnaire survey with care workers , nurses , and therapists linked to residents and structured interviews with residents were conducted at eight facilities in Japan. The questionnaire comprised 25 items regarding basic activities of daily living , instrumental activities of daily living ( IADL) , environment and lifestyle ( EL) , and emotion. ( Results) The data of 88 residents ( 83.0 % female , 86.4 % aged â‰¥ 75 years) and 125 staff members ( 63 care workers , 36 nurses , and 26 therapists) were analyzed. Perceptions regarding the subjective needs of residents differed significantly by occupation with regard to pace of eating , pace of dressing , and freedom to brush at any time; shaving or putting on make-up; personal space , role performance , and health exercises; and feeling good. All three occupations underestimated the subjective needs of residents for household chores. ( Conclusion) Staff members had insufficient understanding of the subjective needs of residents , with a tendency to underestimate IADL and EL needs. Perceived subjective needs also differed by occupation. Sharing the understanding of subjective needs of older individuals within multidisciplinary care teams is desired.
