 Two bis ( diaryldiazomethane) s substituted with amino groups are synthesized and used for the surface modification of membranes<symptom> electrospun from gelatin. These membranes<symptom> are then reacted with tolylene-2,4-diisocyanate to give urea-functionalized materials , so that hydrogen peroxide can be reversibly bound onto their surface. These membranes<symptom> are characterized by scanning electron microscopy , XPS , differential scanning calorimeter , and tensile test to show their surface properties and bulk properties. The surface modification with amino-substituted diazomethanes and the subsequent cross-linking reaction with diisocyanates contribute to high loadings of hydrogen peroxide , and greatly increase the antibacterial activity of gelatin-derived membranes<symptom> , which open a new horizon in the preparation of high loading antiseptic/antibacterial biomacromolecular surfaces and interfaces.
