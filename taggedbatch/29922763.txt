 Management of patients undergoing endoscopy and under treatment with the newer direct oral anticoagulants ( DOACs) is a common and a complex clinical issue that gastroenterologists have to face more and more often these days. The increasing use of DOACs in patients requiring both short- and long-term anticoagulation is mostly due to the advantages these agents offer , among which the lack of monitoring requirements and the reduced need of dose adjustments are perhaps the most important ones. Managing these patients in the peri-endoscopic period implies balancing the risk for thrombosis that a certain patient carries and the bleeding risk associated with the endoscopic procedure itself. The Romanian Society of Gastroenterology and Hepatology decided to create a consensus paper to serve to practitioners and teachers. After reviewing the available published data and existing recommendations , a Delphi consensus process was carried out involving the leaders of opinion in this field. After reaching expert consensus , we provide herein guidance for a practical approach of DOACs therapy management in patients with endoscopic interventions.
