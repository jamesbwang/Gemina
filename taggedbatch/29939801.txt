 A century of advances in infectious<disease> disease<disease> diagnosis and treatment changed the face of medicine. However , challenges continue to develop including multi-drug resistance , globalization that increases pandemic risks , and high mortality from severe infections. These challenges can be mitigated through improved diagnostics , and over the past decade , there has been a particular focus on the host response. Since this article was originally published in 2015 , there have been significant developments in the field of host response diagnostics , warranting this updated review. Areas Covered: This review begins by discussing developments in single biomarkers and pauci-analyte biomarker panels. It then delves into ` omics , an area where there has been truly exciting progress. Specifically , progress has been made in sepsis<disease> diagnosis and prognosis; differentiating viral , bacterial , and fungal pathogen classes; pre-symptomatic diagnosis; and understanding disease-specific diagnostic challenges in tuberculosis<disease> , Lyme<disease> disease<disease> , and Ebola<disease>. Expert Commentary: As ` omics have become faster , more precise , and less expensive , the door has been opened for academic , industry , and government efforts to develop host-based infectious<disease> disease<disease> classifiers. While there are still obstacles to overcome , the chasm separating these scientific advances from the patient 's bedside is shrinking.
