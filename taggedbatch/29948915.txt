 The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the supplementation of a slow-release bolus of zinc ( Zn) , selenium ( Se) , and cobalt ( Co) at late gestation ( 6 week prepartum) on performance and some blood metabolites of Mehraban ewes and their lambs until weaning. Seventy pregnant ewes , 6 weeks prior to expected lambing , were randomly divided into two groups ( 35 heads each) including ( 1) control group and ( 2) slow-release bolus group. Blood samples of ewes were obtained on day 10 prepartum and 45 and 90 days postpartum , and milk samples were collected on day 45. Blood samples of lambs were collected on days 10 , 45 , and 90. Body<symptom> weight at birth and weaning and average daily gain were higher and percentage of mortality and white muscle disease rate were lower in lambs whose mothers were given a bolus ( P < 0.05). Slow-release bolus administration increased serum alkaline phosphatase and whole blood glutathione peroxidase activity , plasma concentrations of Zn , Se , and vitamin B
