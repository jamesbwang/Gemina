 Meningitis<disease><symptom> , a disease of the Central Nervous System is described as inflammation<symptom> of the covering of the brain and spinal<disease> cord ( meninges). It is characterised by fever<symptom> , severe<symptom> headache<symptom> , nausea<symptom> , vomiting , stiff<symptom> neck , photophobia<symptom> , altered consciousness<symptom> , convulsion/seizures and coma<symptom>. In December , 2015 , twelve suspected cases of meningitis<disease><symptom> were reported in Tain district in Brong Ahafo region ( BAR). Subsequently , dozens of suspected cases were hospitalized in five district hospitals in BAR. We investigated to determine the magnitude , causative agent and risk factors for the disease transmission. A community-based 1:2 case-control study ( with 126 individuals) was conducted form 10/12/15 to 26/4/16 in 27 districts of Brong-Ahafo Region , Ghana. We defined suspected meningitis<disease><symptom> cases as people presenting with sudden<symptom> headache<symptom> and fevers<symptom> ( Temp > 38.0 Â°C) in combination with one of the following signs: neck stiffness , altered consciousness<symptom> , convulsions<symptom> , bulging fontanelle ( infants) and other meningeal signs. Controls were selected from the same neighbourhood and defined as individuals with no overt meningitis<disease><symptom> signs/symptoms. We collected CSF samples and performed serological testing using Pastorex-Meningitis-Kit and culture for bacterial isolation. Moreover , structured questionnaires were used to collect data on socio-demographics , living conditions , health status and other risk factors. We conducted univariate data analysis and logistic regressions to study disease-exposure associations using Stata 15. A total of 969 suspected cases with 85 deaths ( CFR = 9.0 %) were recorded between December , 2015 and March , 2016. Majority , 55.9 % ( 542/969) were females aged between 10 months-74 years ( median 20 years , IQR; 14-34). Of the 969 cases , 141 were confirmed by Laboratory test with Streptococcus<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> identified as the causative agent. Cases were reported in 20 districts but 6 of these districts reported cases above threshold levels. The outbreak peaked in week 6 with 178 cases. Overall attack rate ( AR) was 235.0/ 100,000 population. District specific ARs were; Tain; 143.6/ 100,000 , Wenchi; 110.0/ 100,000 , Techiman; 46.6/ 100,000 , Jaman North; 382.3/ 100,000 and Nkoranza South; 86.4/ 100,000. Female and male specific ARs were 251.3/ 100,000 and 214.5/ 100,000 respectively. Age group 10-19 years were most affected 33.8 % ( 317/940). We identified sore<symptom> throat<symptom> ( aOR = 5.2 , 95 % ( CI 1.1-26.1)) and alcohol use ( aOR = 9.1 , 95 % ( CI 1.4-55.7)) as factors associated with the disease transmission. Meningitis<disease><symptom> outbreak due to Streptococcus<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> was established in BAR. Upper<symptom> respiratory<disease><symptom> tract<symptom><disease> infection<disease> and alcohol use were associated with the outbreak. Mass campaigns on healthy living habits , signs and symptoms of meningitis<disease><symptom> as well as the need for early reporting were some of the control measures instituted. Moreover , we recommend Pneumococcal vaccination in BAR to prevent future outbreaks.
