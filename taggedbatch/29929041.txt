 High concentration of citrate exists in bone of humans and all osteo-vertebrates , and citrate incorporation imparts important biomechanical and other functional properties to bone. However , which cells are responsible for citrate production in bone remains unclear and whether the citrate component changes with bone loss during osteoporosis is also not known. Here , we show that the citrate content is markedly reduced in the bone of mice or rats with age-related , ovariectomy-induced or retinoic acid-induced bone loss. Plasmic citrate is also downregulated in osteoporotic animals. Importantly , the plasmic citrate level of aged osteoporotic males is significantly lower than that of young healthy males and positively correlates with human lumbar spine bone mineral density ( BMD) and total hip BMD. Furthermore , citrate production increases with in vitro osteoblastic differentiation , accompanied by upregulation of proteins involved in citrate secretion , suggesting that osteoblasts are highly specialized cells that produce citrate in bone. Our findings establish a novel relationship between citrate content and bone loss-related diseases such as osteoporosis , suggesting a critical role of bone citrate in the maintenance of the citrate balance<symptom> in the circulation. Serum citrate level may thus represent a novel marker for osteoporosis.
