 Background and aim Gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM) poses a threat to the mother and child. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of acupressure on the glycemic control and insulin requirement of GDM females. Materials and methods Thirty GDM female patients were randomized to either the study group ( SG; n = 15) , which was treated with acupressure and the standard antenatal care , or the control group ( CG; n = 15) , which was treated with the standard antenatal care. Fasting and 2-h post-prandial blood glucose levels , requirement for insulin and insulin resistance were measured at 24 and 36 weeks ' gestation ( WG). Also , neonatal outcomes were registered at delivery. Results The pre intervention showed no statistically significant differences between SG and CG for baseline characteristics of participants ( p > 0.05). Within group analyses , after 12 weeks intervention had shown that 75 g oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT) , insulin resistance , number of required insulin and measure of utilized insulin were significantly reduced ( p < 0.05) , with significant increase in body mass index ( BMI) ( p < 0.05) in both groups. All outcome measures were not significantly changed ( p > 0.05) between both groups at 24 and 36 WG. No significant differences ( p > 0.05) in pregnancy and neonatal outcomes between both groups at labor. Conclusions Acupressure may help to reduce gestational diabetes or insulin treatment for overweight female patients with GDM.
