 Nanoparticles ( NPs) can be toxic , depending on their physico-chemical characteristics. Macroautophagy/autophagy could represent a potential underlying mechanism of this toxicity. We therefore set up a study aimed to characterize in depth the effects , on autophagy , of macrophage exposure to NPs , with a particular attention paid to the role of NP physico-chemical characteristics ( specifically chemical composition , shape , size , length , crystal phase , and/or surface properties). We demonstrate that exposure to carbon nanotubes ( CNT) but not to spherical NPs leads to the blockage of the autophagic flux. We further identified lysosomal dysfunction , in association with the downregulation of SNAPIN expression , as the underlying mechanism responsible for the CNT-induced autophagy blockade. These results identify for the first time the shape as a major determinant of the interaction of NPs with the autophagy pathway. Moreover , identifying the lysosomes and SNAPIN as primary targets of MWCNT toxicity opens new directions in the interpretation and understanding of nanomaterial toxicity.
