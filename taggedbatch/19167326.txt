 Global quantification of total RNA is used to investigate steady state levels of gene expression. However , being able to differentiate pre-existing RNA ( that has been synthesized prior to a defined point in time) and newly transcribed RNA can provide invaluable information e.g. to estimate RNA half-lives or identify fast and complex regulatory processes. Recently , new techniques based on metabolic labeling and RNA-seq have emerged that allow to quantify new and old RNA: Nucleoside analogs are incorporated into newly transcribed RNA and are made detectable as point mutations in mapped reads. However , relatively infrequent incorporation events and significant sequencing error rates make the differentiation between old and new RNA a highly challenging task. We developed a statistical approach termed GRAND-SLAM that , for the first time , allows to estimate the proportion of old and new RNA in such an experiment. Uncertainty in the estimates is quantified in a Bayesian framework. Simulation experiments show our approach to be unbiased and highly accurate. Furthermore , we analyze how uncertainty in the proportion translates into uncertainty in estimating RNA half-lives and give guidelines for planning experiments. Finally , we demonstrate that our estimates of RNA half-lives compare favorably to other experimental approaches and that biological processes affecting RNA half-lives can be investigated with greater power than offered by any other method.
