 N-Phenyl ureidobenzenesulfonates ( PUB-SOs) are a new class of anticancer agents blocking the cell cycle progression in S-phase , inducing replicative stress and DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs). In this study , we evaluate the effect of modifying the nature and the position of different substituents on ring A of PUB-SOs on the antiproliferative activity , pharmacological activity as well as on calculated physicochemical , pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties. Modification of the urea group by an amide group led to new PUB-SO analogs designated as N-phenyl amidobenzenesulfonates ( PAB-SOs). The 2-chloroethyl moiety on ring A was also substituted by different alkyl , cycloalkyl and chloroalkyl groups. The new PAB-SOs and PUB-SOs blocking the cell cycle progression in S-phase exhibit antiproliferative activity in the submicromolar to low micromolar range ( 0.14-27 Î¼M) on four human cancer cell lines , namely HT-1080 , HT-29 , M21 and MCF7. Moreover , selected PUB-SO and PAB-SO derivatives induced the phosphorylation of H2AX in M21 cells and do not exhibit or only slightly alkylating activity as confirmed by the 4- ( 4-nitrobenzyl) pyridine ( NBP) assay. Finally , our results show that structure modifications weakly affect the calculated physicochemical , pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties of PAB-SOs and PUB-SOs. Therefore , PAB-SOs and PUB-SOs are promising anticancer agents inducing replicative stress and DNA damage via a mechanism of action unrelated to DNA alkylation.
