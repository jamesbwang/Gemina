 The increasing manufacture of plastics and their mismanagement has turned plastic into a ubiquitous waste in the marine environment. Among all the substances conforming the plastic items , the effects of a dietary Bisphenol A ( BPA) and Di-isononyl phthalate ( DiNP) have been evaluated in adult male gilthead sea bream , focusing on their effects in the modulation of the Endocannabinoid System ( ECS). In zebrafish , the ECS has been recently chosen as a new target for the activity of some Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals ( EDC) , since it represents a complex lipid signaling network essential for the well-being of the organisms. The results obtained in gilthead seabream showed that BPA and DiNP altered the structure and the biochemical composition of liver , increasing the presence of lipids and triglycerides and decreasing the glycogen and phospholipids. Moreover , the addition of BPA or DiNP in the gilthead sea bream diet altered the levels of endocannabinoids ( EC) and EC-like mediators in the liver. These alterations were also associated to changes at the transcriptomic level of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and ECS metabolism. At the central level , both BPA and DiNP reduced the expression of the endocannabinoid receptor type I ( cnr1) and the neuropeptide Y ( npy) as well as the levels of the endocannabinoid Anandamide ( AEA) , suggesting a downregulation of appetite<symptom>. The results herein reported highlighted the negative effects of chronic dietary exposure to DiNP or BPA on ECS functions and lipid metabolism of male gilthead sea bream liver , showing a similar disruptive activity of these contaminants at metabolic level. Moreover , the novelty of the biomarkers used evidenced possible innovative endpoints for the development of novel OEDCS test guidelines.
