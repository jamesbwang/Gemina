 Lercanidipine is a calcium antagonist with no cardiodepressant activity , long lasting antihypertensive action and reno-protective effect. Our previous data demonstrated that lercanidipine blocks L-type calcium channels ( CaL). However , no data are available concerning its effects on T-type calcium channels ( CaT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on both CaL and CaT and the selectivity ratio of R-lercanidipine , S-lercanidipine and RS-lercanidipine. A comparison with other dihydropyridines ( amlodipine and lacidipine) and the CaT blocker mibefradil was also performed. In patch-clamped guinea-pig ventricular myocytes , a voltage protocol was applied mimicking a normal action potential: HP of -90 mV , 200 ms depolarizing steps to -50/ +50 mV. Lercanidipine was tested at concentrations ( 1-10 µM) able to block ≈ 50 % CaL evoked from a HP in the range of -50 to -30 mV. Cells were superfused with a Na + and K + free solution pre-warmed to 35 °C to abolish overlapping currents. Using the described voltage protocol , all dihydropyridines at 1 µM blocked less than 20 % CaL , with the exception of lacidipine , that reduced CaL > 60 % of control. All calcium channel blockers ( CCBs) blocked a significant amount of CaT , varying from 28 % ( mibefradil) to 4.3 % ( amlodipine). Based on the ratio between CaT and CaL blockade in each cell ( T/L) , mibefradil , as expected , showed the highest T affinity ( T/L = 1.3). Lercanidipine , either racemate or enantiomers , showed a noticeable T selectivity , T/L varying from 1.05 ( S-lercanidipine) to 1.15 ( R-lercanidipine). All CCBs examined in this study showed both T- and L-channel blocking activities and can be differentiated based on their relative affinity. Among tested dihydropyridines , lercanidipine showed the highest T/L selectivity.
