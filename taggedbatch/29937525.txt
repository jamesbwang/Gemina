 Chronic kidney disease ( CKD) is a major global health problem. Unless intensive intervention is initiated , some patients can rapidly progress to end-stage kidney disease. However , it is often difficult to predict renal outcomes using conventional laboratory tests in individuals with CKD. Therefore , many researchers have been searching for novel biomarkers to predict the progression of CKD. Angiogenesis is involved in physiological and pathological processes in the kidney and is regulated by the balance<symptom> between a proangiogenic factor , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)- A , and various endogenous antiangiogenic factors. In recent reports using genetically engineered mice , the roles of these antiangiogenic factors in the pathogenesis of kidney disease have become increasingly clear. In addition , recent clinical studies have demonstrated associations between circulating levels of antiangiogenic factors and renal dysfunction in CKD patients. In this review , we summarize recent advances in the study of representative endogenous antiangiogenic factors , including soluble fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 , soluble endoglin , pigment epithelium-derived factor , VEGF-A
