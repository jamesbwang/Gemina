 The cattle industry is one of the most important Brazilian agribusiness sectors and is a strong contributor to the national economy. Annually about 44.6 million calves are bred , which makes the optimal management of these animals extremely important. Several diseases can affect the initial stages of the bovine production chain , being the bovine respiratory<pathogen><disease> syncytial<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( BRSV) one of the most relevant pathogens. This study aimed to characterize the epidemiology of BRSV infection in dairy cattle herds of SÃ£o Paulo State , Brazil , using serological and risk factors analyses. For that , 1243 blood samples were collected of animals from 26 farms and a questionnaire about possible risk factors for BRSV prevalence was performed. The obtained blood sera were analyzed using virus neutralization test ( VNT). VNT results showed high BRSV prevalence in dairy cattle herds , reaching 79.5 % of seropositivity. The BRSV seroprevalence among studied farms ranged from 40 to 100 %. The analysis of risk factors indicated that the age group and the occurrence of coinfection with bovine herpesvirus<pathogen> 1 ( BoHV-1) and bovine viral diarrhea<disease><symptom> virus 1 ( BVDV-1) should be associated with a higher prevalence of BRSV , while natural suckling was considered a protective factor. The study showed that adult animals over 1 year old are an important risk factor for the high seroprevalence of BRSV in herds. The high BRSV prevalence associated with BoHV-1 and BVDV-1 suggests that biosecurity measures should be applied in order to reduce viral dissemination. Additionally , the natural suckling may be an important management to protect calves from high BRSV seroprevalence.
