 Austropurcellia , a genus of dispersal-limited arachnids endemic to isolated patches of coastal rainforest in Queensland , Australia , has a remarkable biogeographic history. The genus is a member of the family Pettalidae , which has a classical temperate Gondwanan distribution; previous work has suggested that Austropurcellia is an ancient lineage , with an origin that predates Gondwanan rifting. Subsequently , this lineage has persisted through major climatic fluctuations , such as major aridification during the Miocene and contraction and fragmentation of forest<disease> habitats during the Last Glacial Maximum ( LGM). In order to understand Austropurcellia 's evolutionary and biogeographic history , we generated DNA sequences from both mitochondrial and nuclear loci and combined this information with previously published datasets for the globally-distributed suborder Cyphophthalmi ( i.e. , all mite harvestmen). We generated phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches to date divergences using a relaxed molecular clock. According to our estimates , the family Pettalidae diversified in the late Jurassic , in accordance with Gondwanan vicariance. Within Pettalidae , Austropurcellia split from its sister group in the early Cretaceous and began to diversify some 15 Ma later. Therefore , its presence in Australia predates continental rifting-making it one of very few hypothesized examples of Gondwanan vicariance that have withstood rigorous testing. We found a steady rate of diversification within the genus , with no evidence for a shift in rate associated with Miocene aridification. Ages of splits between species predate the Pleistocene , consistent with a `` museum '' model in which forest<disease> refugia acted to preserve existing lineages rather than drive speciation within the group.
