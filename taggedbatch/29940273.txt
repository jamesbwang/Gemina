 Y-box binding protein 1 ( YB-1) is a member of the cold shock<symptom> domain protein superfamily and is involved in development , environmental stresses and DNA oxidative damage in many organisms. However , the precise functions of YB-1 are still not well understood in various insects , including bees. In the current study , we identified a YB-1 gene in Apis cerana cerana ( AccYB-1). The predicted cis-acting elements in the promoter sequence of AccYB-1 indicated its possible roles in development and stress responses. AccYB-1 expression was higher in one-day-old larvae and dark-eyed pupae than in other development stages. Tissue-specific expression analysis showed that the mRNA level of AccYB-1 was higher in the thorax and midgut than in other tissues. The results from real-time PCR showed that AccYB-1 was induced by many environmental stresses. Silencing AccYB-1 downregulated the transcriptional level of some growth- and development-related genes and antioxidant genes and decreased the enzyme activities of several antioxidant-related enzymes , further indicating a possible function of AccYB-1 in growth , development and stress responses. Taken together , our findings suggest that AccYB-1 may play an indispensable role in growth and development and environmental stress responses in Apis cerana cerana. To our knowledge , this is the first paper to explore the role of YB-1 in bees.
