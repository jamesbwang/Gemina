 A new class of non-spherical particles was recently designed in our research group by mixing a polysaccharide grafted with fatty acids and α-cyclodextrin in water. Because their flat surfaces , and according to their size , particles are called micro- or nano-platelets. Here , we varied the composition of fatty acids grafted on chitosan ( oleic acid , palmitic acid or stearic acid) and characterized platelet morphology. Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) , cryogenic TEM , scanning electron microscopy , atomic force microscopy ( AFM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy experiments showed that the platelets have a preferentially hexagonal shape with sharp edges , independently on alkyl chain grafted on chitosan. Furthermore , AFM topographic analysis of platelet surface showed parallel thin terraces with 12-14-nm height , suggesting a multi-layered structure alternating chitosan and fatty-acid/α-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes. We also revealed for the first time that a simple magnetic mixing of fatty acids with α-cyclodextrin in water results from solid inclusion complexes with a crystalline structural organization characterized by powder X-ray diffraction. Our results demonstrate that fatty acid/α-cyclodextrin interaction is the driving force for platelet formation.
