 Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis ( PAP) is a rare disease diagnosed pathologically by the build up of surfactant in the alveolar spaces. Establishing a diagnosis usually requires invasive procedures such as bronchoalveolar lavage and forceps biopsy to obtain tissue specimens. Infrequently , surgery is required when histopathological results from other modalities are equivocal. Cryobiopsy has emerged as a novel technique for obtaining lung tissues in pulmonary diseases. Recently , cryobiopsy has been used to diagnose diffuse parenchymal lung disease , but it has rarely been used for the diagnosis of PAP. Here , we describe a 54-year-old male businessman presenting with intermittent coughing with yellowish sputum<symptom> and dyspnoea upon exertion for half a year. Tissues from forceps biopsy fail to yield a specific diagnosis , whereas those from cryobiopsy confirm the diagnosis of PAP. Cryobiopsy offers several diagnostic advantages compared to conventional techniques and appears to be a potential diagnostic tool for diagnosing PAP.
