 We studied the outcome of 47 adult patients with relapsed acute leukaemia ( AML = 25 and ALL = 22) treated with FLAG-mitoxantrone regimen. Median time to relapse was 10.7 months ( range 1.9-27.7). Complete remission ( CR2) was 60.1 % which was significantly more frequent in ALL compared to AML ( P = 0.049). WBC count < 100 Ã— 10
