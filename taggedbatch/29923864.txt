 Many multivalent vaccines target only a subset of all pathogenic types. If vaccine and nonvaccine types compete , vaccination may lead to type replacement. The plausibility of type replacement has been assessed using the odds ratio ( OR) of co-infections in cross-sectional prevalence data , with OR > 1 being interpreted as low risk of type replacement. The usefulness of the OR as a predictor for type replacement is debated , as it lacks a theoretical justification , and there is no framework explaining under which assumptions the OR predicts type replacement. We investigate the values that the OR can take based on deterministic S usceptible- I infected- S usceptible and S usceptible- Infected- Recovered- S usceptible multitype transmission models. We consider different mechanisms of type interactions and explore parameter values ranging from synergistic to competitive interactions. We find that OR > 1 might mask competition because of confounding due to unobserved common risk factors and cross-immunity , as indicated by earlier studies. We prove mathematically that unobserved common risk factors lead to an elevation of the OR , and present an intuitive explanation why cross-immunity increases the OR. We find that OR < 1 is predictive for type replacement in the absence of immunity. With immunity , OR < 1 remains predictive under biologically reasonable assumptions of unidirectional interactions during infection , and an absence of immunity-induced synergism. Using the OR in cross-sectional data to predict type replacement is justified , but is only unambiguous under strict assumptions. An accurate prediction of type replacement requires pathogen-specific knowledge on common risk factors and cross-immunity.
