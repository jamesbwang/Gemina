 Nanoporous gold ( np-Au) electrode coatings have shown improved neural electrophysiological recording fidelity in vitro , in part due to reduced surface coverage by astrocytes. This reduction in astrocytic spreading has been attributed to the influence of electrode nanostructure on focal adhesion ( FA) formation. This study describes the development and use of a microfluidic flow cell for imposing controllable hydrodynamic shear on astrocytes cultured on gold surfaces of different morphologies , in order to study the influence of nanostructure on astrocyte adhesion strength as a function of np-Au electrode morphology. Astrocyte detachment ( a surrogate for adhesion strength) monotonically increased as feature size was reduced from planar surfaces to np-Au , demonstrating that adhesion strength is dependent on nanostructure. Putative mechanisms responsible for this nanostructure-driven detachment phenomenon are also discussed.
