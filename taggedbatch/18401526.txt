 BACKGROUND The POZ/BTB and AT-hook-containing Zinc finger protein 1 ( PATZ1) is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor belonging to the POZ domain Kr√ºppel-like zinc finger ( POK) family. It is involved in the pathogenesis of a growing list of human<disease> diseases<disease> , including cancer. The effect of PATZ1 on serous ovarian carcinoma ( SOC) remains unclear. This study initially explored the clinical significance of PATZ1 in patients with SOC , the relationship between its expression and the prognosis of SOC patients , and its role in tumor proliferation and invasion. MATERIAL AND METHODS Immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR) were performed to characterize the expression of PATZ1 in SOC tissues. The relationship between PATZ1 expression and the clinicopathological features of patients with SOC was analyzed by chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analyses were utilized to evaluate the prognosis of SOC. PATZ1-constructed transfection-mediated overexpression was conducted. The CCK-8 assay was performed to examine the proliferation , while Transwell assay was used to detect the invasive capability. RESULTS The results of IHC and qPCR analyses showed that the expression of PATZ1 in cancerous tissue was significantly lower than that in non-cancerous tissues. Meanwhile , PATZ1 expression was significantly associated with tumor differentiation and LN metastasis. Survival analysis showed that PATZ1 expression was one of the independent prognosis factors for overall survival of SOC patients. In addition , overexpression of PATZ1 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of OVCAR3 cells by in vitro experiments. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that PATZ1 is a novel prognostic marker in SOC.
