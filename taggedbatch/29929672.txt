 This study sought to evaluate the influence of slow conducting anatomic isthmuses ( SCAI) as dominant ventricular tachycardia<symptom> ( VT) substrate on QRS duration. QRS prolongation has been associated with VT in repaired tetralogy of Fallot. Seventy-eight repaired tetralogy of Fallot patients ( age 37 ± 15 years , 52 male , QRS duration 153 ± 29 ms , 67 right bundle branch blocks ( RBBB)) underwent programmed stimulation and electroanatomic activation mapping during sinus rhythm. Right ventricular ( RV) surface , RV activation pattern , RV activation time , conduction velocity at AI , and remote RV sites were determined. Twenty-four patients were inducible for VT ( VT +); SCAI was present in 22 of 24 VT + but only in 2 of 54 patients without inducible VT ( VT-). Conduction velocity through AI was slower in VT + patients ( median of 0.3 ( 0.3 to 0.4) vs. 0.7 ( 0.6 to 0.9) m/s; p < 0.01) but conduction velocity in the remote RV did not differ between groups. In non-RBBB , QRS duration was similar in VT + patients ( n = 6) and VT- patients ( n = 5) , but RV activation within SCAI exceeded QRS offset in VT + patients ( 37 ± 20 ms vs. -5 ± 9 ms , p < 0.01). In RBBB , both QRS duration and RV activation time were longer in VT + patients ( n = 18 , 17 of 18 QRS > 150 ms) compared with VT- patients ( n = 49 , 27 of 49 QRS > 150 ms) ( 173 ± 22 ms vs. 156 ± 20 ms; p < 0.01; 141 ± 22 ms vs. 129 ± 21 ms; p = 0.04). In VT + patients , QRS prolongation > 150 ms ( n = 17) was due to SCAI or blocked isthmus in 15 patients ( 88 %) and 1 ( 6 %). In contrast , in VT- patients , QRS prolongation > 150 ms ( n = 27) was due to enlarged RV or blocked isthmus in 10 patients ( 37 %) and 8 ( 30 %) , but due to SCAI in only 1 ( 4 %). After exclusion of a severely enlarged RV , a QRS duration > 150 ms was highly predictive for SCAI/blocked AI ( OR: 17; 95 % CI: 3.3 to 84; p < 0.01). A narrow QRS interval does not exclude VT-related SCAI. In the presence of RBBB , SCAI further prolongs QRS duration. QRS duration > 150 ms is highly suspicious for SCAI or isthmus block distinguishable by electroanatomic mapping.
