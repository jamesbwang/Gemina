 Dogs can serve human society in various ways by working at tasks based on their superior olfactory sensitivity. However , it has been reported that only about half of all trained dogs qualified as working dogs through conventional breeding management , because proper temperament and health are needed in addition to their innate scent detection ability. To overcome this low efficiency of producing working dogs and to reduce the enormous costs of maintaining unqualified dogs , somatic cell nuclear transfer has been applied to propagate working dogs. Here , we review the history of cloning working dogs , and evaluate health development , temperaments and behavioral similarities of cloned dogs. We also discuss concerns about dog cloning including birth defects , lifespan and cloning efficiency.
