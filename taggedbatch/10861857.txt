 Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>) internalization into bovine mammary epithelial cells ( bMECs) is considered an important pathogenic mechanism for the establishment of mastitis<symptom>. Given the interesting link between selenium ( Se) status and mastitis<symptom> , our objective was to prove that Se was essential to suppress pro-inflammatory mediators , in part , by modulation of Toll-like receptor2 ( TLR2) , nuclear factor kappaB ( NF-κB) and mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK) signal transduction pathway in bMECs. Results showed that Se ( 0 ~ 16 μM) did not affect the growth of bMECs. The mRNA expression of TLR2 , Myeloid differentiation factor 88 ( Myd88) , Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase4 ( Irak4) , Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase1 ( Irak1) and TNF receptor-associated factor6 ( Traf6) in TLR2 signal pathway were increased or significantly increased by S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>. Se played an important role in regulating the genes expression of TLR2 , Myd88 , Traf6 but not in controlling the expression of Irak4 and Irak1. In addition , Se exerted strong inhibitory effects on the genes expression of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha ( TNF-α) , interleukin-1β ( IL-1β) and interleukin-6 ( IL-6) induced by S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>. To further investigate the possible signaling mechanisms involved in the processes , we analyzed the role of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathway in inflammation<symptom> response in S. aureus-stimulated bMECs in vitro. Results showed that the phosphorylation of inhibitory kappaB alpha ( IκBα) , p65 , p38 and extracellular regulated protein kinase ( Erk) were significantly increased in S. aureus-stimulated bMECs. It indicated that S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> activated NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathway. We also examined the effects of Se on the phosphorylation of IκBα , p65 , p38 and Erk in NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathway , which have well been proved to control the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory mediators during inflammation<symptom>. The findings are exciting , that pretreatment with Se ( 4 , 8 μM) significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of IκBα , p65 , p38 and Erk. These results suggest that Se down-regulates inflammatory mediators TNF-α , IL-1β and IL-6 gene expressions via TLR2 , NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathway in S. aureus-stimulated bMECs , which may be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of Se.
