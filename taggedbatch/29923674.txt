 The aim of this study was to evaluate antifungal activity in a diverse group of chlorine-containing xanthone and phenoxyethyl amine derivatives- and to select the most promising compounds for further studies. The antifungal efficacy of 16 compounds was tested with qualitative and quantitative methods against both reference and clinical strains of dermatophytes , moulds and yeasts. The disc-diffusion method has demonstrated that from 16 tested compounds , 7 possess good antifungal activity against dermatophytes and/or moulds while none of them has shown good efficacy against yeasts or bacterial strains. The most active compounds ( 2 , 4 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 16) were tested quantitatively by broth dilution method to obtain MIC values. The MIC values against dermatophytes ranged from 8 to 64 Î¼g/ml. Compound 2 was the most active one against dermatophytes ( MIC
