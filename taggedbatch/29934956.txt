 The aim of this study was to compare bone block grafts fixed at a distance ( BBG-D) with the SonicWeld Rx shell technique ( Poly-D-L-Lactide foil fixed at a distance , augmented with autogenous and deproteinized bovine bone particles ( SWST)) for lateral alveolar ridge augmentation. In this single-blinded , randomized , controlled trial , 30 patients with a bucco-palatal bone width of â‰¤ 3 mm were randomized into the treatment groups: `` BBG-D '' and `` SWST ''. Bone width was measured with cone beam computed tomography ( CBCT). One implant was placed at each grafted site. Frequencies of complications , bone gain and bone resorption in the CBCT were assessed as outcomes. Fifteen sites were augmented in each treatment group. One graft ( 7 %) in the BBG-D group and five ( 33 %) in the SWST group were lost ( p = 0.17). In the SWST group , two implants ( 20 %) were lost and none in the BBG-D group ( p = 0.18). The rate of pooled severe complications ( loss of graft and/or implant) was different ( p = 0.035). Five ( 33 %) wound<disease><symptom> dehiscences happened in the SWST group and none in the BBG-D group ( p = 0.042). Seven ( 47 %) nonsevere complications ( wound<disease><symptom> dehiscence , inflammation<symptom> , transient nerve injury) happened in the SWST group and one ( 7 %) in the BBG-D group ( p = 0.035). At the one-year evaluation , there were no significant differences in bone loss at the mesial , distal or buccal implant shoulder between treatment groups. Within the limitations of this study , the BBG-D method remains the gold standard for lateral alveolar ridge augmentation compared to the shell technique because of the lower complication rates.
