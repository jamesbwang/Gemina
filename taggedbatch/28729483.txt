 Chromatin regulators play a broad role in regulating gene expression and , when gone awry , can lead to cancer. Here , we demonstrate that ablation of the histone demethylase LSD1 in cancer cells increases repetitive element expression , including endogenous retroviral elements ( ERVs) , and decreases expression of RNA-induced silencing complex ( RISC) components. Significantly , this leads to double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA) stress and activation of type 1 interferon , which stimulates anti-tumor T cell immunity and restrains tumor growth. Furthermore , LSD1 depletion enhances tumor immunogenicity and T cell infiltration in poorly immunogenic tumors and elicits significant responses of checkpoint blockade-refractory mouse melanoma to anti-PD-1 therapy. Consistently , TCGA data analysis shows an inverse correlation between LSD1 expression and CD8
