 The methoxymethanes have been studied and compared with the fluoromethanes. The energies and atomic charges were calculated using MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ , and the group separation energies and bond dissociation enthalpies were calculated using CBS-QB3. The group separation energies are endothermic and the BDE increases with additional substitution as a result of the increase in charge at the central carbon. The greater charge leads to a stronger bond to the new substituent as well as to the original substituents. With the methoxymethanes , there is a linear relationship between the BDE and the atomic charge at C. The energies of the several methoxymethane conformers were calculated , and their energies usually increase with increasing values of the electronic spatial extent in accord with a proposal by Gillespie. The role of hyperconjugation in these cases is not settled.
