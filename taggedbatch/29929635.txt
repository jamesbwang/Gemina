 The present study aimed to test the clinical benefit of combined transcatheter mitral plus tricuspid valve edge-to-edge repair ( TMTVR) as compared with transcatheter mitral valve edge-to-edge repair ( TMVR) alone in patients with both significant mitral ( MR) and tricuspid regurgitation ( TR) at high surgical risk. A growing number of patients with severe MR at increased surgical risk are treated by transcatheter techniques. Evidence suggests that residual TR remains a predictor of adverse outcome in these patients. Sixty-one patients ( mean age 79.5 ± 8.4 years , EuroSCORE II 8.6 ± 5.9 %) underwent TMTVR ( n = 27) or TMVR ( n = 34). Echocardiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and after the procedure. Reduction of MR was similar in patients undergoing TMTVR and TMVR. Effective regurgitant orifice area of TR was reduced from 0.51 to 0.29 cm TMTVR appears superior to TMVR in terms of cardiac output and functional improvement early after the intervention , and improves clinical outcome up to 18 months of follow-up.
