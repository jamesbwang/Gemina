 HIV/HCV co-infected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) have poorer survival than HCV mono-infected patients. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic factors for survival. From 2006 to 2013 , 55 incident HCCs among HIV<pathogen> +/ HCV + patients , from three ANRS cohorts , were compared with 181 HCCs in HIV<pathogen>-/ HCV + patients from the ANRS Cirvir cohort. HIV<pathogen> +/ HCV + patients were younger ( 50 years ( IQR: 47-53) vs 62 ( 54-70) , P < 0.001) , male ( 89 % vs 63 % , P < 0.001) than HIV<pathogen>-/ HCV + patients. At HCC diagnosis , both groups had a majority of non-responders to anti-HCV-therapy , and HIV<pathogen> +/ HCV + patients had more frequently known a previous cirrhosis decompensation ( 31 % vs 14 % , P = 0.005). At diagnostic imaging , there were more infiltrative forms of HCC in HIV<pathogen> +/ HCV + group ( 24 % vs 14 % , P < 0.001) , associated with tumour portal thrombosis in 29 %. During a median follow-up period of 11.96 ( 5.51-27) months since HCC diagnosis , a majority of palliative treatments were decided in HIV<pathogen> +/ HCV + patients ( 51 % vs 19 % , P < 0.001). The 1 and 2-year crude survival rates were 61 % versus 78 % and 47 % versus 63 % , P = 0.003 respectively. In a Cox model multivariate analysis adjusted for the cohort , age and sex , the most important prognostic factor for survival was the infiltrative form of the tumour ( aRR: 8.10 ( 4.17-15.75) , P < 0.001). The radiological aggressiveness of the tumour is the best prognostic factor associated with poorer survival of HCC in HIV<pathogen> +/ HCV + patients. High Î±-foetoprotein level and decompensated cirrhosis are other ones. This justifies a particular attention to the detection and the management of small nodules<symptom> in this high-risk population.
