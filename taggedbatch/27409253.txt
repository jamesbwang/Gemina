 Four inhaler adherence clusters have been identified using the INCA audio device in COPD patients: ( 1) regular use/good technique , ( 2) regular use/frequent technique errors , ( 3) irregular use/good technique , and ( 4) irregular use/frequent technique errors. Their relationship with healthcare utilization and mortality was established , but the cost-effectiveness of adherence-enhancing interventions is unknown. In this exploratory study , we aimed to estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of reaching optimal adherence in the three suboptimal adherence clusters , i.e. , a theoretical shift of clusters 2 , 3 , and 4 to cluster 1. Cost-effectiveness was estimated over a 5-year time horizon using the Irish healthcare payer perspective. We used a previously developed COPD health-economic model that was updated with INCA trial data and Irish national economic and epidemiological data. For each cluster , interventions would result in additional quality-adjusted life years gained at reasonable investment. Cost-effectiveness was most favorable in cluster 3 , with possible cost savings of $ 845/annum/person.
