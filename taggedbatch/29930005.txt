 Macrophages play key roles in inflammation<symptom> and diabetic vascular complications. Emerging evidence implicates long noncoding RNAs in inflammation<symptom> , but their role in macrophage dysfunction associated with inflammatory diabetic complications is unclear and was therefore investigated in this study. RNA-sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated that a long noncoding RNA These results demonstrate novel mechanisms involving upregulation of long noncoding RNA
