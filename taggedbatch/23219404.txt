 To evaluate the alteration of pressure characteristics in the cerebral venous sinuses before and after venous sinus stenting ( VSS) using mean sinus pressures ( MSPs) , sinus pressure gradient ( SPG) , and sinus pressure pulsatility ( SPP) parameters among the idiopathic intracranial hypertension ( IIH) patients. Prospective evaluation of 45 consecutive IIH patients who underwent VSS at our institution. A written informed consent approved by the Weill Cornell Institutional Review Board was signed by the study participants. All patients ( The mean age of the study population was 30.6 ± 10 years ( 7-59 years) and 43 out of 45 are female patients. The mean weight and BMI of the study population were 96 ± 24.7 kg ( 30.8-144 kg) and 35.6 ± 8.3 kg/M VSS resulted in immediate alteration of the cerebral venous sinus pressure measurements in patients with IIH.
