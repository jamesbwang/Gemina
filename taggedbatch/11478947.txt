 Contact hypersensitivity<disease> ( CHS) is a common T cell-mediated skin disease induced by epicutaneous sensitization to haptens. Mast cells ( MCs) are widely deployed in the skin and can be activated during CHS responses to secrete diverse products , including some with pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions. Conflicting results have been obtained regarding pathogenic versus protective roles of MCs in CHS , and this has been attributed in part to the limitations of certain models for studying MC functions
