 Endoscopic stenting is used to palliate malignant large bowel obstruction. A proportion of patients will develop recurrent obstruction due to tumour ingrowth and require reintervention. This study aimed to assess the outcome ( clinical success and complication rates) of endoscopic reintervention compared with surgical intervention in patients with stent obstruction due to tumour ingrowth. This was an observational study using data from a database of patients who underwent palliative colonic stenting between January 1998 and March 2017 at Christchurch Public Hospital. A total of 190 patients underwent colonic stent insertion , for palliation in 182 cases. Reintervention was performed in 55 ( 30 · 2 per cent). Thirty-one patients ( 17 · 0 per cent) developed obstruction within the stent at a median of 4 · 6 ( i.q.r. 2 · 3-7 · 7) months after the procedure. Of these , 21 had endoscopic restenting and ten underwent surgery. Restenting had technical and clinical success rates of 100 per cent , and involved a significantly shorter length of stay compared with surgery ( median 2 ( i.q.r. 1-4) versus 11 ( 6-19) days respectively; P = 0 · 006). Seven of the 21 patients in the restented group underwent a third palliative intervention. The overall stoma rate in the restented group was significantly lower than that in the surgical group ( 4 of 21 versus 10 of 10; P < 0 · 001). There was no difference in complications or survival between the two groups. Among palliative patients who develop malignant stent obstruction , endoscopic restenting had a high chance of technical success. It resulted in a shorter hospital stay and lower stoma rate than those seen after surgery.
