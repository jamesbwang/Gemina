 For fluorescence molecular tomography , higher spatial resolution can be achieved using minimally scattered early photons. Conventional reconstruction methods of early photon tomography ( EPT) are based on the integral of temporal point spread function ( TPSF) , which may lead to poor image quality due to systematic noise and time mismatch between the TPSF data and forward model. The derivative of the rising portion of TPSF is proposed to be used in EPT to increase the performance of reconstruction because the derivative is less sensitive to noise and time mismatch than the integral. A method based on projected Tikhonov regularization with the reconstructed result of steepest descent algorithm as a priori information is developed. Using the derivative of TPSF , the method can achieve high spatial resolution in phantom experiments and is capable of separating targets with an edge-edge distance of 1.5 mm.
