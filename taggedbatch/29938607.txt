 This methodological article reflects on the contribution audio diaries can make to accessing important , and commonly silenced , dimensions of the lived experience of growing up with HIV<pathogen> and their acceptability to children. Audio diaries were used by 12 young people , aged 11 to 13 years , as part of a longitudinal qualitative study embedded within the Anti-Retroviral Research for Watoto ( ARROW) clinical trial. The method provided an alternative means for young people to express detailed reflections on their day-to-day encounters , as well as ordinarily silenced topics , including hidden and suppressed emotions regarding the circumstance surrounding their perinatal infection. Although the audio diary has great potential as method , its efficacy rests on young people 's understanding of how to use it. There are ethical challenges around maintaining confidentiality while participants are in possession of the diaries and provision of appropriate support. The technology used in the study was in many ways cumbersome compared with opportunities increasingly available.
