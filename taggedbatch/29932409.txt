 Membranous nephropathy ( MN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome<disease><symptom>. Rarely , it can present with rapidly-progressive renal<symptom> failure<symptom> and hematuria<symptom>. While this may be due to lupus nephritis , superimposed anti-glomerular basement membrane ( GBM) disease , or antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( ANCA)- associated vasculitis , there have been rare reports of anti-GBM- and ANCA-negative crescentic glomerulonephritis<disease> presenting in primary membranous nephropathy ( pMN). We present the case of a patient with long-standing pMN who developed acute deterioration of renal function and was found to have a flare of MN along with crescentic glomerulonephritis<disease> ( GN) despite a negative serum ANCA , anti-GBM , and antinuclear antibody ( ANA) work-up. He was started on dialysis and immunosuppressive therapy , and eventually recovered enough renal function to become dialysis-independent. A brief review of available literature suggests that crescentic GN presenting with pMN is a rare but established entity. Much more rarely has it been reported to occur in patients with previously-diagnosed pMN. In these contexts , crescentic GN may be occurring as the most severe manifestation of pMN rather than as a separate entity. Immunosuppressive therapy is often given , however , prognosis is guarded as half of patients will have worsening renal function and a quarter will develop end-stage renal disease..
