 The objective of this study was to evaluate the nutritional value of Glutenol , a new coproduct of the ethanol industry. Glutenol was produced by Quality Technology International , Elgin , IL , in a modified wet-milling plant using a hybrid process , NextGenFrac , which fractionates the corn kernel components prior to fermentation without the use of sulfur dioxide. Glutenol was analyzed to contain 52.3 % CP , 1.7 % Met + Cys , 1.32 % Lys , 1.69 % Thr , and 2.23 % Val on a DM basis. Two precision-fed rooster assays with conventional and cecectomized roosters were conducted to determine TMEn and standardized digestibility of amino acids ( AA) , respectively. The TMEn of Glutenol was determined to be 3,256 kcal/kg DM. Standardized digestibility values for Lys , Met , Cys , Thr , and Val were 80.1 % , 90.4 % , 80.1 % , 74.1 % , 81.1 % , and 84.9 % , respectively. In addition , a 3-wk broiler chick assay was conducted with increasing levels of dietary Glutenol. Diet 1 was a standard corn/soybean meal diet with 0 % Glutenol. Diets 2 , 3 , and 4 had increasing levels of Glutenol at 4 % , 8 % , and 12 % , respectively. Diets were fed from 3 to 22 d post-hatch and all diets were formulated to be equal in TMEn and digestible AA. Weight gain , feed intake , and gain/feed ratio were measured. No differences in growth performance were observed among dietary treatments. In conclusion , Glutenol can be fed up to at least 12 % in the diet of broiler chickens if diets are formulated to be equal in ME and digestible AA.
