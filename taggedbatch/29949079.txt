 The field of systematic conservation planning has grown substantially , with hundreds of publications in the peer-reviewed literature and numerous applications to regional conservation planning globally. However , the extent to which systematic conservation plans have influenced management is unclear. This paper analyses factors that facilitate the transition from assessment to implementation in conservation planning , in order to help integrate assessment and implementation into a seamless process. We propose a framework for designing implementation strategies , taking into account three critical planning aspects: processes , inputs , and context. Our review identified sixteen processes , which we broadly grouped into four themes and eight inputs. We illustrate how the framework can be used to inform context-dependent implementation strategies , using the process of ` engagement ' as an example. The example application includes both lessons learned from successfully implemented plans across the engagement spectrum , and highlights key barriers that can hinder attempts to bridge the assessment-implementation gap.
