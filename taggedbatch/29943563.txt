 Concurrent presentation of acute hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> A<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HAV<pathogen>) infection and Graves ' disease has not been reported in literature worldwide. Although there is no well-established mechanism that explains the induction of Graves ' disease by HAV<pathogen> to date , our case suggests that HAV<pathogen> infection may be responsible for inducing Graves ' disease. A healthy 27-year-old female presented fever<symptom> , palpitation , and diarrhea<disease><symptom> , and she was subsequently diagnosed as acute HAV<pathogen> infection. Concurrently , she showed hyperthyroidism , and the diagnosis was made as Graves ' disease. She had never had symptoms that suggested hyperthyroidism , and previous thyroid function test was normal. Acute HAV<pathogen> infection was recovered by conservative management , however , thyroid dysfunction was maintained even after normalization of liver enzymes. Methimazole was used to treat Graves ' disease. We report a case of concurrent acute HAV<pathogen> infection and Graves ' disease in a patient without preexisting thyroid disease. This suggests that HAV<pathogen> infection may be a trigger for an autoimmune thyroid disease in susceptible individuals.
