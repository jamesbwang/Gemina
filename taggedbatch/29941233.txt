 Preterm infants have lower levels of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids ( LCPUFAs). Supplementing very premature infants with intravenous lipid emulsions that fish oil , which is rich in n-3 LC-PUFAs , may decrease bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD) by modulating inflammation<symptom> and neonatal immune function. Sixty very low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( VLBW) premature infants requiring ventilator support were randomized in a double-blind manner to 2 groups and received total parenteral nutrition with fish oil containing LE ( intervention group , n = 30) or soybean oil containing LE ( control group , n = 30) for 7 days. Blood samples and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF) were obtained for assay on day 1 and 7 days after LE. The primary outcome was to compare the levels of interleukin ( IL) -1 β and IL-6 in serum and BALF. Secondary outcomes were to compare mortality and co-morbidities. The levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in serum and BALF were significantly lower in the intervention group at day 8 ( p < 0.05). The incidence of BPD in the intervention group compared to the control group was 13.3 % versus 36.7 % ( p = 0.04; odds ratio ( OR) , 0.36; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.21-0.86). The duration of ventilator support and oxygen use was significantly less in the intervention group than in the control group ( p < 0.05). The level of alanine aminotransferase was significantly lower in the intervention group on day 8 ( p = 0.031). In very premature infants , early administration of fish oil containing LE significantly decreased IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and BALF and was associated with shorter duration of ventilator support and less bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD).
