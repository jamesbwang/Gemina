 In recent years , major advances in molecular imaging of prostate cancers ( PCa) were made with the development and clinical validation of highly accurate PET tracers to stage and restage the disease. Prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA) is a transmembrane protein highly expressed in PCa , and its expression has led to the development of PSMA-binding radiopharmaceuticals for molecular imaging or radioligand therapy ( RLT). We herein review the recent literature published on diagnostic and therapeutic ( i.e. theranostic) PSMA tracers. Development in small PSMA-targeted molecules labeled with gallium-68 and fluorine-18 show promising results for primary staging and detection of disease at biochemical recurrence using PET/computed tomography ( PET/CT). Studies show a higher sensitivity and specificity , along with an improved detection rate over conventional imaging ( CT scan and bone scan) or choline PET tracers , especially for restaging after prostate-specific antigen failure following loco-regional therapy. In addition , some PSMA tracers can be labeled with beta-minus and alpha particle emitters , yielding encouraging response rates and low toxicity , and potentially offering a new line of targeted therapy for metastatic castration-resistant PCa. PSMA-targeted tracers have shown unprecedented accuracy to stage and restage PCa using PET/CT. Given their specific biodistribution toward PCa tissue , PSMA RLT now offers new therapeutic possibilities to target metastatic PCa. Prospective multicenter randomized studies investigating the clinical impact management impacts of PSMA-targeted molecules are urgently needed.
