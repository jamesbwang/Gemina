 HIV-associated lymphoma was first classified as an AIDS-defining disease by the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) in 1985. Non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas ( NHLs) are frequent malignancies in AIDS patients. The risk of NHL in the case of an underlying HIV<pathogen> infection is estimated to be 100 times greater than in the general population , and it increases with the progression of the retrovirus-related immunosuppression. Cases of HIV-related non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma are widely documented in the literature. In this article we present three cases of NHL and HIV<pathogen> hospitalized over a period of three years ( 2013-2016) at our specialized department for AIDS patients. Two of them were initially diagnosed with NHL and then with HIV<pathogen> infection. In one patient , NHL developed despite the patient 's taking background antiretroviral therapy. The first case was a 38-year-old male diagnosed previously with HIV<pathogen> , who developed a palpable mass in the left zygomatic bone. The second case was a 52-year-old male who was first diagnosed with a cutaneous lymphoma , and subsequently with HIV<pathogen> infection. The third patient was a 63-year-old male who presented with two palpable masses: one in the left part of the mandible , and the other in the right inguinal region , the latter subsequently diagnosed as lymphoma. Following the latter diagnosis , the patient tested positive for HIV<pathogen>. The histological findings of the three lymphomas were as follows: an NHL plasmoblastic lymphoma , a cutaneous large B-cell anaplastic lymphoma , and a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The first patient received antiretroviral therapy ( ART) and EPOCH ( etoposide , pharmarubicin , vincristin , endoxane , uromitexan) plus radiotherapy , while the second received ART and CHOEP ( endoxan , epirubicin , vincristin , etoposide , prednisolone). The third patient died a few days after beginning antiretroviral therapy.
