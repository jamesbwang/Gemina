 Mixotrophic plants combine photosynthesis and heterotrophic nutrition. Recent research suggests mechanisms explaining why mixotrophy is so common in terrestrial ecosystems. First , mixotrophy overcomes nutrient limitation and/or seedling establishment constraints. Second , although genetic drift may push mixotrophs to full heterotrophy , the role of photosynthesis in reproduction stabilizes mixotrophy.
