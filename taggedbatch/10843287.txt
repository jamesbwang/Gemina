 The present study investigated the expression and clinical significance of micro-ribonucleic acid-23a ( miR-23a) and metastasis suppressor 1 ( MTSS1) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL). A total of 70 cases of tumor tissues of patients with DLBCL and 30 cases of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia<disease> tissues were collected. OCI-LY10 cell was transfected with miR-23a antisense oligonucleotide ( miR-23a ASO). The expression of miR-23a and MTSS1 in tumor tissues of patients with DLBCL and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia<disease> tissues were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry. Spearmans test was used for correlation analysis was also performed for their expression. The relationship of the expressions of miR-23a and MTSS1 with the pathological parameters of patients with DLBCL was further analyzed. The DLBCL OCI-LY10 cells were cultured
