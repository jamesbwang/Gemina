 The advent of next-generation sequencing has boosted the analysis of bacterial genome evolution. Insertion sequence ( IS) elements play a key role in prokaryotic genome organization and evolution , but their repetitions in genomes complicate their detection from short-read data. PanISa is a software pipeline that identifies IS insertions ab initio in bacterial genomes from short-read data. It is a highly sensitive and precise tool based on the detection of read-mapping patterns at the insertion site. PanISa performs better than existing IS detection systems as it is based on a database-free approach. We applied it to a high-risk clone lineage of the pathogenic species Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , and report 43 insertions of five different ISs ( among which three are new) and a burst of ISPa1635 in a hypermutator isolate. PanISa is implemented in Python and released as an open source software ( GPL3) at https://github.com/bvalot/panISa. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
