 Silicon blue-emitting nanoparticles ( NPs) are promising effectors for photodynamic therapy and radiotherapy , because of their production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) upon irradiation. Amino-functionalized silicon NPs ( NH Subsequent derivatizations after amino-functionalization and incorporation to nanodrug delivery systems could expand the spectrum of the biomedical application of these kind of silicon NPs.
