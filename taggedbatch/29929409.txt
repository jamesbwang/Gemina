 Historically , political elites adopted the idea of human rights if , and only if , it could foster their interests. Today , it is thus public interest civil society organizations , and not states , that are left to contribute most to the protection of and the struggle for human rights. Despite human rights being enshrined in constitutions , nowadays they can primarily be effectively claimed by those with access to the courts and by the press , i.e. , those in power. Public interest civil society organizations and social movements are the only ones left to play this crucial role. The need for the global human rights movement to bridge the gap that has opened up between itself and the majority of the public is clear. Communications in the human rights domain simply have to become less legalistic and more hands-on. To claim their rights , those rendered poor need real power. Those who have been left poor and oppressed do not ever get to actively claim their rights. Instead they ask for mercy , expect charity , and seek benefits from benevolent masters.
