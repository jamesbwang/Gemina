 Tributyltin ( TBT) is a widespread environmental contaminant that is present in human blood and other tissues. It has been shown to disrupt the immune function of human natural killer ( NK) cells and to alter the secretion of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines from immune cells. Secretion of both interleukin 1β ( IL-1β) and interleukin 6 ( IL-6) from human lymphocytes can be increased dependent upon the level of TBT exposure. This study shows that the TBT-induced increases in secretion of both cytokines are due to TBT-induced increases in the synthesis of these proteins and not simply because of the release of pre-existing cytokine. Furthermore , the data indicate that these TBT-induced increases in IL-1β and IL-6 synthesis require MAP kinase signaling pathways. Additionally , elevated synthesis of IL-1β and IL-6 seen at the highest exposures to TBT ( 200 , 200 , 50 nM) were accompanied by increases in the mRNA for these cytokines. TBT-induced increases in IL-1β and IL-6 mRNAs were also shown to be dependent on MAP kinase signaling. The study suggests that TBT has the capacity to increase immune cell production of these 2 important pro-inflammatory cytokines and that this increase is in part explained by increased mRNA for the cytokines.
