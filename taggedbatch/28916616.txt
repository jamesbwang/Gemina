 Thymoma and thymic carcinoma , known as the most common features of thymic epithelial tumors ( TETs) , are thoracic malignancies displaying varied clinical features and prognosis. These neoplasms being frequently ineligible for surgical complete resection as a curative treatment because of extensive tumor spread , effectual nonsurgical treatments are needed; however , an optimal chemotherapeutic regimen has not been identified , although some regimens have been shown to be active. Immunotherapy is effective for other malignancies and may be promising as a therapeutic alternative for refractory TETs. Thus far , several studies have determined the expression of programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) and programmed death 1 ( PD-1) in TETs , including its clinicopathological and prognostic significance. The results have been conflicting due to the different immunohistochemical antibodies employed and distinct cutoff values. However , many authors identified abundant PD-L1 expression in TETs , which is considered as an important predictive factor for therapeutic effect of PD-1 inhibitors in other malignant tumors. In some clinical trials , an acceptable clinical efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor for TETs has been reported as expected; however , concerns regarding immunological adverse events have been raised. To optimize these therapeutic agents for refractory TETs , additional studies which evaluate clinical availabilities of immunotherapeutic drugs and characterize their basic mechanisms of action against immunotherapeutic targets are both urgently required.
