 Patient Reported Outcome Measures ( PROMs) are useful for understanding the health needs and outcomes of the general public. We aim to develop a burn-specific metric-Adult Burn Outcome Questionnaire ( ABOQ)- that is brief and can be administered electronically to all burn survivors over the age of 18. The 14-item ABOQ was developed from the already validated Young Adult<disease> Burn Outcome Questionnaire ( YABOQ) long form. The ABOQ questionnaire , along with Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement System-10 ( PROMIS-10) , was administered to 120 outpatient burn survivors at three hospitals. Clinical validity of the ABOQ was measured by testing associations between ABOQ items and burn size , the PROMIS-10 generic items and composite scales using correlational analysis including multivariate canonical analysis. Nine out of 14 ABOQ items were significantly correlated with burn size ( correlations ranging from -0.25 to -0.46 , P < .01). The canonical correlation between ABOQ and burn size was 0.68 ( P = .0002). The overall canonical correlation between two instruments was also significant ( P < .0001). At the item level , at least 25 % of the variation in each of the five ABOQ items could be explained by PROMIS-10 items and composite scores , while six other items could only be accounted for by less than 15 % of the variation. ABOQ short form assessment can be used to efficiently measure burn outcomes across a range of relevant clinical domains with credible validity. A large proportion of the variation in ABOQ scores was not accounted for by PROMIS-10 , suggesting that ABOQ provided additional health-related information specifically for the burn population beyond the generic instrument.
