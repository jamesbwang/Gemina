 Attention can be attracted reflexively by sensory signals , biased by learning or reward , or focused voluntarily based on momentary goals. When voluntary attention is focused by purely internal decision processes ( will) , rather than instructions via external cues , we call this `` willed attention. '' In prior work , we reported ERP and fMRI correlates of willed spatial attention in trial-by-trial cuing tasks. Here we further investigated the oscillatory mechanisms of willed attention by contrasting the event-related EEG spectrogram between instructional and choice cues. Two experiments were conducted at 2 different sites using the same visuospatial attention paradigm. Consistent between the 2 experiments , we found increases in frontal theta power ( starting at ~ 500 ms post cue) for willed attention relative to instructed attention. This frontal theta increase was accompanied by increased frontal-parietal theta-band coherence and bidirectional Granger causality. Additionally , the onset of attention-related posterior alpha power lateralization was delayed in willed attention relative to instructed attention , and the amount of delay was related to the timing of frontal theta increase. These results , replicated across 2 experiments , suggest that theta oscillations are the neuronal signals indexing decision-making in the frontal cortex , and mediating reciprocal communications between the frontal executive and parietal attentional control regions during willed attention.
