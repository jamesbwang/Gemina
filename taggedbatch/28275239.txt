 Molecular chirality and the inherently connected differential absorption of circular polarized light ( CD) combined with semiconducting properties offers great potential for chiral opto-electronics. Here we discuss the temperature-controlled assembly of enantiopure prolinol functionalized squaraines with opposite handedness into intrinsically circular dichroic , molecular J-aggregates in spincasted thin films. By Mueller matrix spectroscopy we accurately probe an extraordinary high excitonic circular dichroism , which is not amplified by mesoscopic ordering effects. At maximum , CD values of 1000 mdeg/nm are reached and , after accounting for reflection losses related to the thin film nature , we obtain a film thickness independent dissymmetry factor g = 0.75. The large oscillator strength of the corresponding absorption within the deep-red spectral range translates into a negative real part of the dielectric function in the spectral vicinity of the exciton resonance. Thereby , we provide a new small molecular benchmark material for the development of organic thin film based chiroptics.
