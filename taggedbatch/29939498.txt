 Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> is a nosocomial , opportunistic pathogen that causes several serious conditions such as meningitis<disease><symptom> , septicemia<disease><symptom> , endocarditis<disease> and pneumonia<disease>. It can be found in the oral biofilm , which may be a reservoir for pneumonia<disease> and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Subgingival colonization by A.<pathogen> baumannii is associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis<disease> as well as refractory periodontal<disease> disease<disease>. Porphyromonas<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> , a keystone periodontal pathogen localized to subgingival plaque , is also implicated in several chronic conditions including aspiration pneumonia<disease>. While both bacteria are found together in subgingival plaque and can cause multiple polymicrobial infections , nothing is known about the interactions between these two important human pathogens. In this study , we used RNA sequencing to understand the transcriptional response of both species as they adapt to heterotypic communities. Among the differentially regulated genes were those encoding a number of important virulence factors for both species including adhesion , biofilm formation , and protein secretion. Additionally , the presence of A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> increased the abundance of P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> in model dual species communities Collectively these results suggest that both P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> and A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> adapt to each other and have synergistic potential for increased pathogenicity. In identifying the mechanisms that promote pathogenicity and refractory disease , novel approaches to mitigate polymicrobial synergistic interactions may be developed to treat or prevent associated diseases.
