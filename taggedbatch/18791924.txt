 Herbal medicines are an alternative choice for treatment or controlling of polycystic ovary syndrome<disease><symptom> ( PCOS). Effect of hydroalcoholic extract of flaxseed was evaluated on ovarian hormones and histological changes of uterus and ovary in a PCOS-induced rat model. Twenty four rats divided into four groups including negative control , positive control , PCOS and treatment groups. Positive control group received hydroalcoholic extract of flaxseed for 30 days. PCOS was induced by single intramuscular injection of estradiol valerate. Treatment group was treated with flaxseed extract 7 weeks after induction of PCOS for 30 days. Ovaries and uterus were dissected out and their sections were used for histomorphometric study. Levels of estradiol , progesterone , testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA) were measured in the serum. In the treatment group , flaxseed extract increased level of progesterone ( Hormonal profile and histomorphometric features of ovary that were disturbed by PCOS induction were ameliorated by hydroalcoholic extract of flaxseed.
