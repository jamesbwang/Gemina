 Inequalities in infant mortality rates ( IMRs) are rising in some low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs) and decreasing in others , but the explanation for these divergent trends is unclear. We investigate whether government expenditures and redistribution are associated with reductions in inequalities in IMRs. We estimated country-level fixed-effects panel regressions for 48 LMICs ( 142 country observations). Slope and Relative Indices of Inequality in IMRs ( SII and RII) were calculated from Demographic and Health Surveys between 1993 and 2013. RII and SII were regressed on government expenditure ( total , health and non-health) and redistribution , controlling for gross domestic product ( GDP) , private health expenditures , a democracy indicator , country fixed effects and time. Mean SII and RII was 39.12 and 0.69 , respectively. In multivariate models , a 1 percentage point increase in total government expenditure ( % of GDP) was associated with a decrease in SII of -2.468 ( 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs): -4.190 , -0.746) and RII of -0.026 ( 95 % CIs: -0.048 , -0.004). Lower inequalities were associated with higher non-health government expenditure , but not higher government health expenditure. Associations with inequalities were non-significant for GDP , government redistribution , and private health expenditure. Understanding how non-health government expenditure reduces inequalities in IMR , and why health expenditures may not , will accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.
