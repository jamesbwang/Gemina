 In 1962 Victor Herbert developed megaloblastic anaemia four months after commencing a severely folate-deficient diet whereas , in his self-experiment 50 years later , this author took 19 months to fully deplete his liver folate store. This author proposed that his own larger initial liver folate store , due to his vegetarian diet and consumption of fortified foods , was the cause of the time difference. This author now proposes that Herbert was also likely to have been deficient in vitamin C , thus shortening the time taken to develop folate deficiency. Several human experiments have confirmed the role of vitamin C in protecting reduced forms of folate from oxidation. Although there has historically been no consensus on the required intake of vitamin C , and official recommendations set a level below that required to ensure plasma saturation , recent research supports an intake that would ensure saturation. There have been no longitudinal experiments on human subjects since the introduction of voluntary or mandatory folic acid fortification of food , and the few published models differ significantly in their estimates of human liver folate storage capacity. Because of the importance of folate in one-carbon metabolism , the potential influence of vitamin C intake on the time taken to deplete the liver folate store should be experimentally investigated.
