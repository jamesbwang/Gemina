 We examined whether anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> symptoms constitute increased risk of bloodstream infection ( BSI) , as a proxy for sepsis<disease>. A general population with self-reported anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> symptoms was followed prospectively for hospital-verified BSI. Using multivariable Cox regression analysis , we estimated hazard ratios ( HR) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI) of BSI and BSI mortality , with and without statistical adjustment for comorbidities , BMI and lifestyle factors that may confound or mediate the associations. During 14.8 years median follow-up of 59,301 individuals , 1578 ( 2.7 %) experienced BSI , and 328 ( 0.55 %) participants died within 30 days after a BSI. Severe<symptom> depression<symptom> symptoms were associated with a 38 % increased risk of BSI , adjusted for age , sex and education ( HR 1.38 , 95 % CI , 1.10-1.73). The hazard ratio was attenuated to 1.23 ( 0.96-1.59) after adjustment for comorbidities , and to 1.15 ( 0.86-1.53) after additional adjustment for BMI and lifestyle factors. For severe anxiety<symptom> symptoms , the corresponding HRs were 1.48 ( 1.20-1.83) , 1.35 ( 1.07-1.70) , and 1.28 ( 0.99-1.64). Moderate symptoms of depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> were not associated with increased BSI risk. The analysis of BSI mortality yielded imprecise results , but suggested an increased risk of BSI mortality in participants with moderate<symptom> depression<symptom> symptoms. Severe<symptom> depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> symptoms were associated with a moderately increased risk of BSI. The association may , at least in part , be confounded or mediated by comorbidities , BMI and lifestyle. Future research should investigate if interventions targeting improved BMI and lifestyle may reduce the risk of BSI and sepsis<disease> in people with depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> symptoms.
