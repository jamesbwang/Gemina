 Background: Oral cancer is a frequently encountered neoplasm of the head and neck region , being the eight most common type of human malignancy worldwide. Despite improvement in its control , morbidity and mortality rates have improved little in the past decades. Therefore , prevention and/or early detection are a high priority. Proteomics with network analysis have emerged as a powerful tool to identify important proteins associated with cancer development and progression that can be potential targets for early diagnosis. In the present study , network- based protein- protein interactions ( PPI) for oral cancer were identified and then analyzed for use as key proteins/potential biomarkers. Material and Methods: Gene expression data in articles which focused on saliva proteomics of oral cancer were collected and 74 candidate genes or proteins were extracted. Related protein networks of differentially expressed proteins were explored and visualized using cytoscape software. Further PPI analysis was performed by Molecular Complex Detection ( MCODE) and BiNGO methods. Results: Network analysis of genes/proteins related to oral cancer identified kininogen-1 , angiotensinogen , annexin A1 , IL-8 , IgG heavy variable and constant chains , CRP , collagen alpha-1 and fibronectin as 9 hub-bottleneck proteins. In addition , based on clustering with the MCODE tool , vitronectin , collagen alpha-2 , IL-8 and integrin alpha-v were established as 5 distinct seed proteins. Conclusion: A hub-bottleneck protein panel may offer a potential/ candidate biomarker pattern for diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer disease. Further investigation and validation of these proteins are warranted.
