 A need exists to characterise the long-term cognitive outcomes in patients who recovered from autoimmune encephalitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> and to identify the modifiable factors associated with improved outcomes. We retrospectively analysed data from patients diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> in our outpatient autoimmune encephalitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> clinic over a 5-year period , where the Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA) is routinely administered. In total , 21 patients met the inclusion criteria , of whom 52 % had persistent cognitive impairment at their latest follow-up ( median delay to testing = 20 months , range 13-182). Visuospatial and executive abilities , language , attention , and delayed recall were predominantly affected. Patients with status epilepticus at presentation had lower total MoCA scores at their last follow-up ( median total score 21 , range 15-29) compared with patients without status epilepticus at presentation ( median total score 27.5 , range 21-30; r 2 = 0.366 , p = 0.004). Patients who experienced delays of more than 60 days from symptom onset to initiation of treatment ( either immunosuppression or tumour removal) were more likely to have a MoCA score compatible with cognitive impairment at their last follow-up ( r 2 = 0.253 , p = 0.0239; z-score = -2.01 , p = 0.044). Our study suggests that the MoCA may be used to evaluate cognition in recovering patients with autoimmune encephalitis<pathogen><disease><symptom>. Delays to treatment shorter than 60 days and absence of status epilepticus at onset were associated with better performance on the MoCA obtained more than 1 year after symptom onset , and may predict better long-term cognitive outcomes.
