 To assess the association between physical activity ( PA) during pregnancy and the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM) accounting for sitting time. The study used data from a cohort study of 2030 pregnant women in Vietnam. Women were recruited from six hospitals in Ha Noi , Hai Phong , and Ho Chi Minh City. Baseline measurements including PA and GDM were taken at 24-28 weeks of gestation. PA was assessed during the past 3 months before the interview using the interviewer-administered Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire. GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation using the 2013 World Health Organization criteria. 1987 out of 2030 pregnant women were included in the final analysis , of which 432 had GDM ( 21.7 %). Women undertaking the highest level ( upper tertile) of PA during pregnancy appeared to have a lower risk of GDM ( odds ratio ( OR) 0.70 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.53-0.94 , P High levels of PA , particularly moderate-intensity and household/caregiving activities during pregnancy were associated with a lower prevalence of GDM independent of sitting time.
