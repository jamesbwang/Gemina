 To determine the feasibility of pre-TACE IVIM imaging based on histogram analysis for predicting prognosis in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC). Fifty-five patients prospectively underwent 1.5 T MRI 1 week before TACE. Histogram metrics for IVIM parameters and ADCs maps between responders and non-responders with mRECIST assessment were compared. Kaplan-Meier , log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazard regression model were used to correlate variables with time to progression ( TTP). Mean ( p = 0.022) , median ( p = 0.043) , and 25 Pre-TACE kurtosis of ADC • mRECIST was associated with TTP independently. • Lower kurtosis and higher mean for ADCs tend to have good response. • Pre-TACE kurtosis of ADC
