 Comorbidity of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) and insomnia , nightmares , and obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) is high. We review recent research on psychotherapeutic and pharmacological interventions for sleep disorders in PTSD. PTSD treatments decrease PTSD severity and nightmare frequency , but do not resolve OSA or insomnia. Research on whether insomnia hinders PTSD treatment shows mixed results; untreated OSA does interfere with PTSD treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is the recommended treatment for insomnia; however , optimal ordering with PTSD treatment is unclear. PTSD treatment may be most useful for PTSD-related nightmares. CPAP therapy is recommended for OSA but adherence can be low. Targeted treatment of sleep disorders in the context of PTSD offers a unique and underutilized opportunity to advance clinical care and research. Research is needed to create screening protocols , determine optimal order of treatment , and elucidate mechanisms between sleep and PTSD treatments.
