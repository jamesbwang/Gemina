 The objective of this study is to evaluate by means of a systematic review , the efficacy of thymectomy as compared to medical treatment for non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis ( MG). Medline , Embase , and Lilacs were searched for experimental and observational studies that compared non-surgical ( drug therapy) and surgical treatment of non-thymomatous MG ( thymectomy performed by the transsternal approach). Inclusion criteria were: studies that compared the two types of treatment and had at least 10 adult patients in each group. Exclusion criteria were articles published before 1970 , as well as those that included patients treated before 1950. The outcomes evaluated were: remission , and improvement rates. RevMan 5.3 software provided by the Cochrane Collaboration was used. When the heterogeneity between the studies was greater than 75 % , a meta-analysis was not performed according to RevMan guidelines. The total number of patients evaluated in 19 articles selected was 5841 ( 2911 surgical and 2930 non-surgical). Two included randomized clinical trials showed superiority of the surgical treatment over the non-surgical. Four retrospective studies with 379 patients paired by gender , age , and other confounders , also showed superiority of surgical treatment ( OR 4.10 , 95 % CI 2.25 to 7.44; I Thymectomy may be considered effective in the treatment for non-thymomatous MG , with remission rate higher than for non-surgical treatment.
