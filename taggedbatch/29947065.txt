 Synthetic mimics of natural high-performance structural materials have shown great and partly unforeseen opportunities for the design of multifunctional materials. For nacre-mimetic nanocomposites , it has remained extraordinarily challenging to make ductile materials with high stretchability at high fractions of reinforcements , which is however of crucial importance for flexible barrier materials. Here , highly ductile and tough nacre-mimetic nanocomposites are presented , by implementing weak , but many hydrogen bonds in a ternary nacre-mimetic system consisting of two polymers ( poly ( vinyl amine) and poly ( vinyl alcohol)) and natural nanoclay ( montmorillonite) to provide efficient energy dissipation and slippage at high nanoclay content ( 50 wt %). Tailored interactions enable exceptional combinations of ductility ( close to 50 % strain) and toughness ( up to 27.5 MJ m
