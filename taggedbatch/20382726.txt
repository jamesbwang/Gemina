 Peritoneal dialysis is an effective treatment modality for patients with end-stage renal disease. The relative use of peritoneal dialysis versus hemodialysis varies widely by country. Data from a 2004 survey reports the percentage of patients with end-stage renal disease treated with peritoneal dialysis to be 5 % -10 % in economically developed regions like the US and Western Europe to as much as 75 % in Mexico. This disparity is probably related to the availability and access to hemodialysis , or in some cases patient preference for peritoneal over hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis<disease> remains the major complication and primary challenge to the long-term success of peritoneal dialysis. Fifty years ago , with the advent of the Tenckhoff catheter , patients averaged six episodes of peritonitis<disease> per year on peritoneal dialysis. In 2016 , the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis proposed a benchmark of 0.5 episodes of peritonitis<disease> per year or one episode every 2 years. Despite the marked reduction in peritonitis<disease> over time , peritonitis<disease> for the individual patient is problematic. The mortality for an episode of peritonitis<disease> is 5 % and is a cofactor for mortality in another 16 % of affected patients. Prevention of peritonitis<disease> and prompt and appropriate management of peritonitis<disease> is essential for the long-term success of peritoneal dialysis in all patients. In this review , challenges and solutions are addressed regarding the pathogenesis , clinical features , diagnosis , treatment , and prevention of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis<disease> from the viewpoint of an infectious<disease> disease<disease> physician.
