 The mechanisms that regulate fetal hemoglobin ( HbF) expression in sickle cell disease ( SCD) remain elusive. We previously showed that steady-state SCD patients with high HbF levels due to a To further investigate the role of leukocytes in HbF expression in SCD , we examined the presence of HbF silencing factors in the serum of 82 SCD patients who received hydroxyurea ( HU) therapy. HU-mediated HbF induction was associated with elevated total hemoglobin levels and improved red blood cell parameters , but there was no correlation with reticulocyte or platelet counts. Importantly , we again found that HU-induced HbF levels correlated with reductions in both neutrophils and lymphocytes/monocytes , indicating that these cell lineages may have a role in regulating HU-mediated HbF expression. Our in vitro studies using CD34 Together , these results demonstrate the importance of leukocyte numbers in the regulation of HbF levels for SCD patients both in steady state and under HU therapy , and that leukocytes secrete HbF silencing factors that negatively affect HbF expression in erythroid-lineage cells in SCD.
