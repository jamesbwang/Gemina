 Breast cancer may affect young women who have not yet completed childbearing. Assisted reproductive technology ( ART) provides alternatives for fertility preservation such as oocyte , embryo or ovarian tissue cryopreservation. We reviewed the published literature on fertility-preserving management in breast cancer , aiming at finding evidence to answer the following questions: ( 1) What are the fertility sparing options available?; ( 2) How do these women respond to IVF? and ( 3) Can pregnancy influence breast cancer recurrence? There is a paucity of publications describing clinical experience and outcome data which limits accessibility to fertility preservation in this setting. Presently , oocyte or embryo cryopreservation are the main options for fertility preservation. IVF success rates are comparable to the ones of non-oncological populations according to the woman 's age but current published studies lack data on definitive success rates following embryo banking for cancer patients. The perception that IVF and pregnancy may worsen cancer prognosis remains , despite the lack of scientific evidence to support this notion. Published studies show reassuring results for pregnancies occurring > 2 years after breast cancer diagnosis. The best published evidence suggests pregnancy after breast cancer does not increase the risk of disease recurrence , thus pregnancy should not be forbidden once treatment is completed. Decision making for women diagnosed with cancer requires up-to-date knowledge of the efficacy and safety of available options. Providing consultation with a reproductive specialist and appropriate information on fertility preservation for these women should be an essential aspect of their supportive care.
