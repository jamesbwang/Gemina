 The cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 ( FR) , isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine plant Ardisia crenata , is a potent Gq protein inhibitor and thus a valuable tool to study Gq-mediated signaling of G protein-coupled receptors. Two new FR analogues ( 3 and 4) were isolated from A. crenata together with the known analogues 1 and 2. The structures of compounds 3 and 4 were established by NMR spectroscopic data and MS-based molecular networking followed by in-depth LCMS
