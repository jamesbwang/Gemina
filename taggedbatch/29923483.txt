 The aim of this work is to evaluate the treatment strategies for a common major surgery complication like the enterocutaneous fistula<disease> ( ECFs). Since there is not any standard treatment for this common disease and since new therapies , like NPWT and fibrin sealants , have come up a review of all their indications seemed useful. We also present two clinical cases treated in this way. A research was made in the principle databases such as: `` Cochrane '' , `` Pubmed '' , `` Google Scholar '' and `` Google '' using the following Key words `` enterocutaneous fistula<disease> '' , `` fibrin glue '' , `` VAC '' , `` VAC treatment '' , `` fistula<disease> '' , `` conservative treatment '' , `` surgery '' and using the MESH Function to search similar key words and expand the research. When two or more article with the same design were encountered ( e.g. systematic reviews or case reports etc.) the newest one was chosen as data source. As far as somatostatine and its analogues are concerned , they showed a significant reduction of both time ( 13.95 vs 20.5 days) and percentage ( 72 % vs 44 %) of fistula<disease> closure against placebo in 2 meta-analysis. NPWT showed a high success rate between 90 % and 100 % but longer closure time between 4 weeks and 6 months. Fibrin glues showed heterogeneous results due to the great differencies in fistulas<disease> anatomy and treatment technique in the various studies , with 64-100 % success rate in closure and a median 11,25 vs 23,25 days against total parenteral nutrition ( TPN) alone. Because of ECFs often come up in patient in bad conditions who are not fitted for surgery and because of their high Mortality and Morbidity , a multimodal approach is necessary. Although TPN is a cornerstone of their treatment , NPWT showed is superiority in reducing fistula<disease> output and in some cases leading to fistula<disease> closure , nevertheless it often needs long treating time. Fibrin glues often needs complex devices and are nota s good as NPWT in treating the around tissues , but they can be useful when fistulas<disease> are only accessible from a little external orifice or they show a complex branched tract; thus they are good when surgery is not possible and the fistula<disease> has a mid- or low- output. The lack of prospective randomized studies or meta analysis and systematic review to compare the different methodics makes it impossible to show any evidence of superiority , but the combined application seems reasonable for a tailored treatment.
