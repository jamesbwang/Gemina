 Comparison and integration of neuroimaging data from different brains and populations are fundamental in neuroscience. Over the past decades , the neuroimaging field has largely depended on image registration to compare and integrate neuroimaging data from individuals in a common reference space , with a basic assumption that the brains are similar. However , the intrinsic neuroanatomical complexity and huge interindividual cortical folding variation remain underexplored. Here we focus on a specific cortical convolution pattern , termed 3-hinge gyral folding , which is the conjunction of gyri from multiple orientations and has unique and consistent anatomically , structurally , and functionally connective patterns across subjects. By developing a novel shape descriptor and a two-stage clustering pipeline , we devise an automatic method to identify 3-hinges in the Human Connectome Project Q3 868 human brains , and further parameterize the complexity of such a pattern and quantify its regularity and variation in terms of 3-hinge number , position , and morphology. Our results not only exhibit the huge interindividual variations , but also reveal regular relationship between gyral hinges and other factors , such as their locations and cortical morphologies. It is found that `` line-shape '' cortices have relatively more consistent 3-hinge shape pattern distributions , and certain types of 3-hinge patterns favor particular cortical morphologies. In addition , more 3-hinges are found on `` line-shape '' cortices while their numbers vary more across subjects than those on `` non-line-shape '' cortices. This study adds new insights into a better understanding of the regularity and variability of human brain anatomy , and their functional aspects.
