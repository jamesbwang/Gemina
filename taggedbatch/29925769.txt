 Mono-polar spindle 1 ( Mps1/TTK) represents a protein kinase reported to be vital for cell division processes and is generally regarded as an attractive target for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma , breast carcinoma , and colon cancer. However , the C604Y mutation has been linked to acquired resistance. Recently , three potential small-molecule inhibitors of Mps1 ( i.e. , reversine , NMS-P715 , and its derivative Cpd-5) were reported for the C604Y mutation that exhibit significant resistance to NMS-P715 and Cpd-5 , but retain affinity for reversine. In this study , classical molecular dynamic ( MD) simulations , accelerated MD ( aMD) simulations , and umbrella sampling ( US) simulations were performed to illustrate the resistance mechanisms of inhibitors to Mps1. The classical MD simulations combined with free energy calculations revealed that reversine features similar binding affinity characteristics to both Mps1
