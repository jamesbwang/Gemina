 Purpose To evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of surface-derived imaging biomarkers obtained from contrast material-enhanced volumetric T1-weighted pretreatment magnetic resonance ( MR) imaging sequences in patients with glioblastoma multiforme<pathogen>. Materials and Methods A discovery cohort from five local institutions ( 165 patients; mean age , 62 years ± 12 ( standard deviation); 43 % women and 57 % men) and an independent validation cohort ( 51 patients; mean age , 60 years ± 12; 39 % women and 61 % men) from The Cancer Imaging Archive with volumetric T1-weighted pretreatment contrast-enhanced MR imaging sequences were included in the study. Clinical variables such as age , treatment , and survival were collected. After tumor segmentation and image processing , tumor surface regularity , measuring how much the tumor surface deviates from a sphere of the same volume , was obtained. Kaplan-Meier , Cox proportional hazards , correlations , and concordance indexes were used to compare variables and patient subgroups. Results Surface regularity was a powerful predictor of survival in the discovery ( P = .005 , hazard ratio ( HR) = 1.61) and validation groups ( P = .05 , HR = 1.84). Multivariate analysis selected age and surface regularity as significant variables in a combined prognostic model ( P < .001 , HR = 3.05). The model achieved concordance indexes of 0.76 and 0.74 for the discovery and validation cohorts , respectively. Tumor surface regularity was a predictor of survival for patients who underwent complete resection ( P = .01 , HR = 1.90). Tumors with irregular surfaces did not benefit from total over subtotal resections ( P = .57 , HR = 1.17) , but those with regular surfaces did ( P = .004 , HR = 2.07). Conclusion The surface regularity obtained from high-resolution contrast-enhanced pretreatment volumetric T1-weighted MR images is a predictor of survival in patients with glioblastoma. It may help in classifying patients for surgery.
