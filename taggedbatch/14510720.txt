 Present study involved identification of offending out-door aero-allergens and associated genetic pathway in nasso-bronchial asthma among Kolkata population. Skin-prick test was done among 950 asthmatic patients against 11 common aero-allergens and total serum IgE concentration was measured. PCR-RFLP was done in patients and non-asthmatic control ( n = 220 in each) to characterize functional polymorphism , C ( -159) T , of CD14 , a positional candidate gene for allergy. Association of genetic polymorphisms was made with clinico-pathological conditions. We identified In Kolkata , pollen is a common out-door aero-allergen and
