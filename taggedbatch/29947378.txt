 A variety of device applications has been proposed using polyoxometalate-based ionic liquids. However , the assembly of large polyoxometalate ions on surfaces and the associated interfacial properties are not well understood , particularly since the assembly is influenced by steric effects and stronger ion-ion interactions. In this study , graphene transistors gated with a polyoxometalate-based ionic liquid were probed with in situ Raman spectroscopy and charge transport studies. The ionic liquid comprised Cu-substituted lacunary Keggin anions , ( PW11O39Cu) 5- , which were surrounded by tetraoctyl ammonium cations , ( C32H68N) +. The application of gate voltage caused these ions to assemble at the interface with graphene , which resulted in a shift of the Fermi level of the graphene monolayer grown on a copper foil. The shift was determined by the quantum capacitance , Cq , of graphene in series with the electric-double layer capacitance. Estimates of the electric-double layer thickness , spatial density of the ions and temporal rate of the assembly of the electric double-layer were obtained. This study provides insights into the microscopic understanding of the electric double-layer formation at the graphene interface.
