 Serotonin ( 5-HT) , a well-known neurotransmitter in the brain , also plays an important role in peripheral tissues , including the immune system. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that many different types of immune cells express the machinery to generate , store , respond to and/or transport serotonin , including T cells , macrophages , mast cells , dendritic cells and platelets. In addition , there is emerging evidence of a possible connection between T cells , serotonin and mood disorders. How 5-HT interacts with the peripheral immune system and if this signaling is associated with behavioral phenotypes found in mood disorders like major depressive disorder ( MDD) is not well understood. In this review , we summarize the existing literature on what is known about the link between 5-HT and the immune system and the effects of 5-HT signaling on different cells of the peripheral immune system , with a particular focus on T cells. In addition , we review the current evidence that peripheral immune system alterations and CNS function may be interrelated and the possible implications of these findings for drug discovery.
