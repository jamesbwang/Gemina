 Sibship size and birth order may be contributing factors to the multifactorial etiology of psychosis. Specifically , several studies have shown that sibship size and birth order are associated with schizophrenia. However , there are no studies on their association with psychotic experiences ( PE). Cross-sectional , community-based data from 43 low- and middle-income countries which participated in the World Health Survey were analyzed. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to identify four types of past 12-month PE. The association of sibship size and birth order with PE was assessed with multivariable logistic regression. The final sample consisted of 212,920 adults ( mean ( SD) age 38.1 ( 16.0) years; 50.7 % females). In the multivariable analysis , compared to individuals with no siblings , the OR increased linearly from 1.26 ( 95 % CI = 1.01-1.56) to 1.72 ( 95 % CI = 1.41-2.09) among those with 1 and ≥ 9 siblings , respectively. Compared to the first-born , middle-born individuals were more likely to have PE when having a very high number of siblings ( i.e. ≥ 9). Future studies should examine the environmental and biological factors underlying the association between sibship size/birth order and PE. Specifically , it may be important to examine the unmeasured factors , such as childhood infections and adversities that may be related to both family structure and PE.
