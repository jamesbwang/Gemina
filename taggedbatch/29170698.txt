 Introduction A formative framework for positive lifestyle and health behaviors is established during adolescence. The Boy Scouts of America ( BSA) is one organization that promotes healthy lifestyles among adolescent males and includes earning the Personal Fitness Merit Badge ( PFMB). Despite the BSA Oath `` to keep myself physically strong '' , there is a paucity of evidence describing fitness test ( FT) outcomes or correlations between FT and variables including age or body mass index ( BMI) among Boy Scouts. Therefore , the purpose of this study is to describe and correlate FT to age and BMI among adolescent Boy Scouts. Methods A prospective study design recruited Boy Scouts aged 11-17 years from Southeast Michigan using a sample of convenience. After securing physician clearance to participate , FT measures were performed utilizing previously established methodology. Third year doctor of physical therapy students trained in the measurement protocol performed the FT measures. Measures encompassed those required for the PFMB: BMI , pull-ups , push-ups , sit and reach flexibility test ( SRF) , sit-ups , and the one mile run ( 1MR). Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics , a Kruskal-Wallis test examined relationships between BMI and FT , and a nonparametric Spearman correlation examined correlations between FT performance and both age and BMI with statistical significance set at less than 0.05. Results Ninety-nine Boy Scouts , whose mean age was 12.6 years ( SD 1.4) , met the inclusion criteria. The mean BMI was 21.5 ( kg/height ( cm))
