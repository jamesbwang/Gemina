 Phytohormone abscisic acid ( ABA) induces anthocyanin biosynthesis , however , the underlying molecular mechanism is less known. In this study , we found that the apple MYB transcription factor MdMYB1 activated anthocyanin biosynthesis in response to ABA. Using a yeast screening technique , we isolated MdbZIP44 , an ABA-induced bZIP transcription factor in apple , as a co-partner with MdMYB1. MdbZIP44 promoted anthocyanin accumulation in response to ABA by enhancing the binding of MdMYB1 to the promoters of downstream target genes. Furthermore , we identified MdBT2 , a BTB protein , as an MdbZIP44-interacting protein. A series of molecular , biochemical , and genetic analysis suggested that MdBT2 degraded MdbZIP44 protein through the Ubiquitin-26S proteasome system , thus inhibiting MdbZIP44-modulated anthocyanin biosynthesis. Taken together , we reveal a novel working mechanism of MdbZIP44-mediated anthocyanin biosynthesis in response to ABA.
