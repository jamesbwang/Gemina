 Postoperative pancreatic fistula<disease> ( POPF) is a common complication after pancreatic surgery and is associated with extended hospitalisation , increased medical costs , and reduced quality of life. The aim of the present study was to assess the treatment of POPF in Germany , with a special focus on outpatient drain management in patients with clinically relevant POPF ( CR-POPF). A questionnaire evaluating postoperative management once a CR-POPF is diagnosed- especially focusing on ambulatory drain management- was developed and sent to 211 German hospitals performing > 12 pancreatic operations per year. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 21. The final response rate was 62 % ( n = 131). Outpatient drainage management is performed by most of the responding hospitals ( n = 100 , 76.3 %). However , 30 % of hospitals ( n = 40) perform outpatient treatment only in 5 % of their cases with clinically relevant POPF. There was no correlation between case load of the pancreatic centres and frequency of outpatient drain management. In general , discharge criteria for patients with drained POPF ( n = 98 , 74.8 %) , the drain management itself ( n = 95 , 72.5 %) and criteria for drain removal ( n = 74 , 56.5 %) are not standardised but made individually. In centres with standardised drain management criteria for drain removal , these criteria were drain volume < 20 ml ( 29.8 %) , no fluid collection ( 25.2 %) , no elevation of drain amylase/lipase ( 25.2 %) and no specific symptoms ( 22.1 %). This is the first survey in Germany evaluating outpatient drain management in patients with CR-POPF. Although the data in the literature are rare , the majority of German pancreatic surgeons perform outpatient drain management. However , discharge criteria , outpatient care and drain removal are standardised in only the minority of centres. Therefore , we recommend the evaluation of discharge criteria and a management algorithm for patients with drained CR-POPF to improve the perioperative course.
