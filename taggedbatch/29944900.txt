 Since the launch of the national surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> ( SSI) surveillance service in 1997 , successive expansions of the programme provided hospitals with increasing flexibility in procedures to target through surveillance. Ensuring the programme continues to meet hospitals ' needs remains essential. As a means to inform the future direction of the service , a survey of all acute NHS Trusts was undertaken to assess and understand priorities for surveillance. A web-based survey was circulated to acute NHS Trust infection control teams in England asking them to identify and rank i) reasons for undertaking current SSI surveillance ii) priority surgical categories for future SSI surveillance and iii) reasons for prioritising these categories. Of the 161 Trusts surveyed , 84 ( 52 %) responded. Assessment of quality of care was identified as the most common driver for SSI surveillance activity. Considerable heterogeneity in priority areas was observed , with 24 different surgical categories selected as top priority. Of the procedures undertaken by 15 or more Trusts , Caesarean section ( 2.7) , hip replacement ( 2.8) and coronary artery bypass graft ( 2.9) were highest ranked. All 17 categories in the current surveillance programme were selected as a top priority by one or more Trusts. Whilst the majority of hospitals ' priorities for SSI surveillance are included in the current programme , the top ranked priority , Caesarean section , is not included. Given the diversity of priority areas , maintaining a comprehensive spectrum of categories in the national programme is essential to assist hospitals in addressing local priorities.
