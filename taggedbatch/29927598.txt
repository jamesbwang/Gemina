 A comparative study of the photochemistry of cis- and trans-stilbene in methanol shows that both isomers undergo methanol photoaddition giving similar yields of Î±-methoxybibenzyl in competition with cis-trans photoisomerization. Methanol addition occurs primarily following torsional relaxation of the lowest excited singlet states of each isomer ,
