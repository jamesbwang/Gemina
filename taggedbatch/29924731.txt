 Endometriosis ( EMs) is a chronic<disease> inflammatory condition. Interleukin ( IL) -37 is a member of the IL-1 family and an anti-inflammatory cytokine. This study aimed to evaluate the possible role of IL-37 in the EMs pathogenesis. We investigated the in vivo effect of IL-37 on EMs by injection with recombinant human IL-37 ( rhIL-37) into EMs mice. Furthermore , we evaluated the in-vitro effects of IL-37 on proliferation , adhesion , migration , and invasiveness of endometrial stromal cells ( ESCs) , and explored whether Wnt/β-catenin and mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) pathways were involved in this process. In cultured ESCs , IL-37 overexpression significantly suppressed both protein and mRNA expression of the inflammation-associated cytokines , including IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-10 , and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF-α). Furthermore , IL-37 overexpression significantly inhibited ESCs proliferation , adhesion , migration , invasion , and the activity of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP) -2 and MMP-9. In contrast , knockdown of IL-37 exerted the opposite effects. Importantly , the IL-37- mediated action in ESCs was through inactivation of Wnt/β-catenin , p38 MAPK , ERK1/2 MAPK , and JNK MAPK pathways. Moreover , EMs mice treated with rhIL-37 showed the decreased endometriotic-like lesion<symptom> size and lesion<symptom> weight , lower expression of IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-10 , TNF-α , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) , soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-I ( ICAM-I) , and MMP-2/ 9 activity in peritoneal fluid compared with the wide type ( WT) EMs mice. These findings suggest that IL-37 suppresses cell proliferation , adhesion , migration , and invasion of human ESCs through multiple signaling pathways , thereby affecting the occurrence and development of EMs.
