 The authors describe a technique for visualizing the deployment of femoral suspensory fixation during ligament reconstructions that avoids the need for intraoperative fluoroscopic radiographs. Many surgeons currently use intraoperative fluoroscopic radiographs to confirm satisfactory deployment of the suspensory button on the femur; however , this technique involves prolonged surgical time , additional costs , and radiation exposure to the surgical team and patient. The authors ' technique uses novel leg and camera positioning to allow for direct visualization of the button deployment. This technique can greatly improve operating room efficiency , save money , and decrease radiation exposure during surgery. ( Orthopedics. 2018; 41 ( 4): e587-e590.).
