 The World Health Organization ( WHO) launched the `` End TB Strategy '' , which aims to reduce tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) mortality by 95 % by 2035 , Brazil has made a commitment to this , however , one challenge is achieving the goal in the border region , where the TB situation is more critical. The proposal was to analyse the spatial mortality due to TB and its socio-economic determinants in the general population , around the border areas of Brazil , Paraguay and Argentina , as well as the temporal trend in this region. This ecological study considered the cases of TB deaths of residents of Foz do Igua√ßu ( BR) , with its units of analysis being the census sectors. The standardized mortality rate was calculated for each area. Socioeconomic variables data were obtained from the 2010 Demographic Census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics ( IBGE). The scan statistic was applied to calculate the spatial relative risk ( RR) , considering a 95 % confidence interval ( CI). Spatial dependence was analysed using the Global Bivariate Moran I and Local Bivariate Moran I ( LISA) to test the relationship between the socioeconomic conditions of the urban areas and mortality from TB. Analysis of the temporal trend was also performed using the Prais-Winsten test. A total of 74 cases of TB death were identified , of which 53 ( 71.6 %) were male and 51 ( 68.9 %) people of white skin colour. The mortality rate ranged from 0.28 to 22.75 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. A spatial relative risk area was identified , RR = 5.07 ( 95 % CI 1.79-14.30). Mortality was associated with: proportion of people of brown skin colour ( I: 0.0440 , p = 0.033) , income ( low income I:- 0.0611 , p = 0.002; high income I:- 0.0449 , p = 0.026) and density of residents ( 3 and 4 residents , I: 0.0537 , p = 0.007; 10 or more residents , I:- 0.0390 , p = 0.035). There was an increase in the mortality rate in people of brown skin colour ( 6.1 %; 95 % CI = 0.029 , 0.093). Death due to TB was associated with income , race resident density and social conditions. Although the TB mortality rate is stationary in the general population , it is increasing among people of brown skin colour.
