 The objectives of this study were to evaluate the plasma levels of asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine in children with pulmonary hypertension due to CHD before and after treatment with sildenafil and to evaluate its diagnostic and prognostic value as a biomarker in such children. A total of 60 children with CHD and 30 healthy control children matched for age and sex were recruited. Children with CHD were divided into two equal groups: the normal pulmonary pressure group ( n = 30) and the pulmonary hypertension group ( n = 30). Children with pulmonary hypertension were treated with sildenafil and were followed up for 6 months. Clinical data , haemodynamic parameters , echocardiographic examination , and asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine levels were evaluated before and after treatment. Asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine levels were significantly higher in patients with pulmonary hypertension than in those with CHD-only or the control group , and this increase was positively correlated with increased severity of pulmonary hypertension. Asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine levels , mean pulmonary artery pressure , and pulmonary<disease> vascular resistance were significantly decreased after treatment with sildenafil. Moreover , asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine level was significantly lower in patients who responded to sildenafil treatment compared with those who did not. At a cut-off point of more than 0.85 nmol/ml , asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine has a sensitivity of 83 % and a specificity of 80 % to diagnose pulmonary hypertension-CHD. Asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine has a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 94 % to predict poor prognosis in pulmonary hypertension-CHD children at a cut-off point of 1.3 nmol/ml. Asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine level has a good diagnostic and prognostic value as a biomarker in children with pulmonary hypertension-CHD and can be used for following up patients with pulmonary hypertension and predicting response to treatment.
