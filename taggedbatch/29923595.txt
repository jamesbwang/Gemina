 Selected patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy benefit from epilepsy surgery , however significant delays remain. The aim of this study was to assess knowledge and attitudes toward epilepsy surgery among patients with epilepsy and identify barriers that might delay the treatment. A 10-minute questionnaire was administered to patients with epilepsy in Colombia. Survey assessed the following: knowledge of surgical options , perceptions about the risks of surgery vs. ongoing seizures<symptom> , disease disability , treatment goals , and demographic and socioeconomic variables. We recruited 88 patients with focal epilepsy. More than half of patients ( 56 %) were not aware that surgery might be an option. Apprehension about epilepsy surgery was evident , 60 % of patients perceived epilepsy surgery to be very or moderately dangerous. A large proportion of patients believe death ( 41 %) , stroke ( 47 %) , vision loss<symptom> ( 56 %) , personality change ( 56 %) , paralysis ( 62 %) , difficulties in speaking ( 69 %) , and memory<symptom> loss<symptom> ( 60 %) were frequent side effects. The majority of patients ( 62 %) consider the surgical procedure as the last option of treatment. There is a negative attitude toward epilepsy surgery based on the patients ' misperceptions of suffering neurological deficits during the surgery , reflecting lack of knowledge toward this type of treatment. These perceptions can contribute to delays in surgical care.
