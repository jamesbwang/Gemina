 The materials used in fusion reactor must be resistance to the harmful effects of radiation in the manner of material itself. Selection of the appropriate materials used in nuclear reactor has a crucial importance to achieve the maximum efficiency and security. Ti , Cu and Zr are known to be employed as first wall materials in fusion reactors. In this study , level density parameter effects on ( p , n) and ( p ,2 n) reaction cross-section calculations have been investigated by employing different level density models within TALYS 1.8 computer code for
