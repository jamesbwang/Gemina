 The early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment ( PD-MCI) in Parkinson 's disease ( PD) is essential as it increases the future risk for PD dementia ( PDD). Recently , a novel weighting algorithm for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA) subtests has been reported , to best discriminate between those with and without cognitive impairment in PD. The aim of our study was to validate this scoring algorithm in a large sample of non-demented PD patients , hypothesizing that the weighted MoCA would have a higher diagnostic accuracy for PD-MCI than the original MoCA. In 202 non-demented PD patients , we evaluated cognitive status , clinical and demographic data , as well as the MoCA with a weighted and unweighted score. Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate discriminative ability of the MoCA. Group comparisons and ROC analysis were performed for PD-MCI classifications with a cut-off â‰¤ 1 , 1.5 , and 2 standard deviation ( SD) below appropriate norms. PD-MCI patients scored lower on the weighted than the original MoCA version ( p < 0.001) compared to PD patients with normal cognitive function. Areas under the curve only differed significantly for the 2 SD cut-off , leading to an increased sensitivity of the weighted MoCA score ( 72.9 % vs. 70.5 %) and specificity compared to the original version ( 79.0 % vs. 65.4 %). Our results indicate better discriminant power for the weighted MoCA compared to the original for more advanced stages of PD-MCI ( 2 SD cut-off). Future studies are needed to evaluate the predictive value of the weighted MoCA for PDD.
