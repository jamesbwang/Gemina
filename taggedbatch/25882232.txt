 Patients with vertebral , subclavian , or innominate arterial stenosis can present with recurrent symptoms that can adversely affect the quality of life ( QOL). We aimed at determining the short-term effects of endovascular treatment ( ET) on QOL in these patients. European Quality of Life Five Dimension Scale ( EQ-5D) utility index and visual analog scale ( VAS) were ascertained before and within one month of ET in patients with vertebral , subclavian , or innominate arterial stenosis with recurrent episodes of vertigo<symptom> , near syncope , and/or ataxia<symptom>. The EQ-5D utility scores were derived from responses to five questions on EQ-5D questionnaire ( -0.109 for the least to 1 for most favorable). The EQ-5D VAS score was obtained by subject 's indication of his/her health state on a scale of 0 ( worst) to 100 ( best). Angioplasty and/or stent placement was performed in 10 patients for stenosis in extracranial vertebral ( Improvement in QOL appears to be an important measure of effectiveness of ET in patients with vertebral , subclavian , or innominate arterial stenosis with recurrent episodes of vertigo<symptom> , near syncope , and/or ataxia<symptom>.
