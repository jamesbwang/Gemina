 Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura ( HSP) is a common form of vasculitis in children. It typically involves small vessels of the skin , the gastrointestinal ( GI) tract , joints , and kidneys. GI involvement is the most severe short-term complication and GI bleeding<symptom> is a major complication of HSP. However , there is no established predictive marker of GI bleeding<symptom>. Blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR) has been proposed as a potentially useful marker of clinical outcome in diseases with an inflammatory component. We aimed to determine the association of NLR with HSP and investigate the usefulness of NLR as a marker to predict GI bleeding<symptom> in children with HSP. All patients newly diagnosed as having HSP were reviewed retrospectively. White blood cell count , hemoglobin , platelet counts , mean platelet volume , neutrophil and lymphocyte<symptom> count were evaluated. NLR and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio ( PLR) were calculated using the results from complete blood count tests. This study included of 141 HSP patients. GI involvement was found in 65 patients ( 46.1 %); of them , 15 patients ( 10.6 %) had GI bleeding<symptom>. The NLR ( P = 0.001) and PLR ( P = 0.032) at the time of diagnosis was significantly patients with GI bleeding<symptom> than in those without GI bleeding<symptom>. Logistic regression analysis showed that NLR was the only independent predictor of GI bleeding<symptom> ( P = 0.004). The optimal cutoff value of NLR for predicting GI bleeding<symptom> was 2.86 ( sensitivity , 73 %; specificity , 68 %). NLR , a simple and easily obtainable parameter , is a potential predictive marker of GI bleeding<symptom> in children with HSP. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
