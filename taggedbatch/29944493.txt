 Intravitreal injections of antibiotics and anti-inflammatories are used by some cataract surgeons for surgical prophylaxis. To support this prophylaxis , intravitreal triamcinolone-moxifloxacin ( TM) and triamcinolone-moxifloxacin-vancomycin ( TMV) were tested for preventing Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( SA) endophthalmitis<disease> in rabbits. Trademark formulations of TM ( 15/1 mg/mL) and TMV ( 15/1/10 mg/mL) were intravitreally injected into seven groups of eight rabbits each ( A-G). Before intravitreal injection , the vitreous was first challenged with clinical SA endophthalmitis<disease> isolates ( 5,000 colony-forming unit) with varying minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs in μg/mL) to moxifloxacin ( denoted by the MIC at the end of each group listed): A) TMV-10 , B) TM-10 , C) Saline-10 , D) TM-2 , E) Saline-2 , F) TM-0.032 , and G) Saline-0.032. After 24 hr , the rabbit eyes were graded for clinical endophthalmitis<disease> and cultured for viable SA. Rabbits treated with TMV and challenged by SA with a moxifloxacin MIC of 10 μg/mL did not present with endophthalmitis<disease> ( 0/8 , no eyes with endophthalmitis<disease>). For SA with moxifloxacin MICs of 10.0 and 2.0 μg/mL , TM did not prevent endophthalmitis<disease> ( 16/16 , 100 % of eyes with endophthalmitis<disease>). For SA with a moxifloxacin MIC of 0.032 μg/mL , endophthalmitis<disease> was prevented with TM ( 0/8 , no eyes with endophthalmitis<disease>). All saline-treated eyes developed endophthalmitis<disease> ( 23/23 , 100 % of eyes with endophthalmitis<disease>). Intravitreal monotherapy with TM did not provide consistent prevention of SA endophthalmitis<disease> , whereas intravitreal TMV successfully prevented endophthalmitis<disease> because of SA with elevated MIC values to moxifloxacin. Cataract surgeons need to be aware that vancomycin seems to be essential for intravitreal prophylaxis to cover moxifloxacin resistance.
