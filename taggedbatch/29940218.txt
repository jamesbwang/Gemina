 Since 2005 the S7B and E14 guidances from ICH and FDA have been in place to assess a potential drug candidate 's ability to cause long QT syndrome<disease><symptom>. To refine these guidelines , the FDA proposed the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay ( CiPA) initiative , where the assessment of drug effects on cardiac repolarization was one subject of investigation. Within the myocyte validation study , effects of pharmaceutical compounds on human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes ( hiPSC-CMs) were assessed and this article will focus on the evaluation of the proarrhythmic potential of 23 blinded drugs in four hiPSC-CM cell lines. Experiments were performed on the CardioExcyte 96 at different sites. A combined readout of contractility ( via impedance) and electrophysiology endpoints ( field potentials) was performed. Our data demonstrates that hERG blockers such as dofetilide and further high risk categorized compounds prolong the field potential duration. Arrhythmia were detected in both impedance as well as field potential recordings. Intermediate risk compounds induced arrhythmia in almost all cases at the highest dose. In the case of low risk compounds , either a decrease in FPD With exceptions , hiPSC-CMs are sensitive and exhibit at least 10 % delayed or shortened repolarization from pre-addition values and arrhythmia after drug application and thus can provide predictive cardiac electrophysiology data. The baseline electrophysiological parameters vary between iPS cells from different sources , therefore positive and negative control recordings are recommended.
