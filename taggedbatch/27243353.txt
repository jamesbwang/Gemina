 Eye drops containing 0.1 % hyaluronic acid ( HA) and 0.5 % carboxymethylcellulose ( CMC) applied one drop three times a day per affected eye were compared in patients with moderate keratitis<disease><symptom> or keratoconjunctivitis related to dry<symptom> eye disease ( DED). This was a prospective , randomized , multicenter , Phase IIIB<pathogen> noninferiority study , with a single-masked phase in parallel mode with two groups over 84 days. The primary efficacy outcome was change in ocular surface ( OS) staining between day 0 ( D0) and day 35 ( D35). The conjunctiva and cornea were stained with lissamine green and fluorescein. Secondary efficacy measures at day 84 ( D84) were OS-staining score ( SS) , ocular comfort index , tear-film breakup time and how patients and investigators rated treatment efficacy and safety. At D35 , 0.1 % HA achieved a 46.6 % reduction in OS-SS ( -2.03 ± 1.35 points , n = 39 patients) and 0.5 % CMC treatment , followed by a 34.9 % reduction ( -1.61 ± 1.69 points , n = 38 patients) compared to D0. At D84 , the SS difference to D0 improved by -2.58 ± 1.45 points ( -59.2 %) for 0.1 % HA and -2.59 ± 2.27 points ( -54.4 %) for 0.5 % CMC. Ocular comfort-index scores improved , with significantly lower ( better) values for stinging and itching on D84 for 0.1 % HA. Patients assessed treatment with 0.1 % HA as significantly better than 0.5 % CMC ( Likert scale , 4.82 vs 3.97; DED signs and symptoms of DED significantly improved with both eye drops. OS staining improved > 54 % at D84. Treatment was well tolerated , with only minor AEs < 10 %. 0.1 % HA and 0.5 % CMC were equally safe and effective. Significant and nonsignificant results were constantly in favor of 0.1 % HA.
