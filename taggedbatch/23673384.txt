 To assess drinking occasions ( volume and type) according to consumption with food in or outside meals , and location , for six countries. A total of 10,521 participants aged 4-65 years from Argentina , Brazil , China , Indonesia , Mexico and Uruguay completed a validated 7-day fluid intake record. For each drinking event , the volume consumed , the fluid type , the location of intake , and whether the drink was accompanied by food ( meal or snack) or not , was recorded. Similar drinking behaviors were found in Mexico and Argentina; fluid intake during meals was 48 and 45 % of total fluid intake ( TFI) , respectively. In Brazil ( 55 %) , Indonesia ( 58 %) and China ( 66 %) most fluid was consumed without food. In Uruguay , 34 % of TFI was with a main meal , 31 % with food between meals and 35 % without food. Indonesia had the highest median ( 25-75th percentile) TFI; 2520 ( 1750-3347) mL/day , and China the lowest 1138 ( 818-3347) mL/day. Water was consumed with meals for 37 % of Chinese and 87 % of Indonesian participants , while the four Latin-American American countries showed a preference for sweet drinks; 54 % in Mexico , 67 % in Brazil , 55 % in Argentina and 59 % in Uruguay. Diversity in fluid type was noted when drinking with food between meals. Apart from China , most drinking occasions ( > 75 %) occurred at home. Three distinct drinking behaviors were identified , namely , drinking with meals , drinking as a stand-alone activity , and a type of ` grazing ' ( i.e. , frequent drinks throughout the day) behavior. Most drinking occasions occurred at home.
