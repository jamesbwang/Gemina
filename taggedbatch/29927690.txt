 This study explored street hawkers ' lived experiences and risks in traffic using the phenomenological case study design. Data from 24 hawkers at three hawking spots and field observations form the basis of our study. A stratified purposeful sampling scheme was employed to ensure a balance<symptom> of gender and age. Thematic data analytic strategy was employed in the data analysis. We found that participants ' traffic incidents were mainly self-induced , attributable to their negligence on the road , indiscriminate road crossing and car-following behaviour. Our results suggest a perceived relationship between socio-demographic characteristics and personal traffic accident encounters. Also , we noted that the ability to manage traffic risk seem to influence hawkers ' traffic risk perceptions , with gender and age as possible mediators. As this study is exploratory , we recommend further scientific enquiry to explain these issues and to provide the basis for appropriate interventions to manage the road safety implications of this activity.
