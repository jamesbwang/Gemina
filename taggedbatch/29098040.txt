 The first extended comprehensive data set of the retrieval uncertainties in passive microwave observations of cloud liquid water path ( CLWP) for warm oceanic clouds has been created for practical use in climate applications. Four major sources of systematic errors were considered over the 9-year record of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS ( AMSR-E): clear-sky bias , cloud-rain partition ( CRP) bias , cloud-fraction-dependent bias , and cloud temperature bias. Errors were estimated using a unique merged AMSR-E/Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Level 2 data set as well as observations from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization and the CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar. To quantify the CRP bias more accurately , a new parameterization was developed to improve the inference of CLWP in warm rain. The cloud-fraction-dependent bias was found to be a combination of the CRP bias , an in-cloud bias , and an adjacent precipitation bias. Globally , the mean net bias was 0.012 kg/m
