 Since the end of the 19th century , X-rays have been used to detect lung diseases. In Italy , 207,096 miniature chest radiographs were taken from 1941 to 1948. Traditional radiographs gave better results , but miniature chest radiographs were useful for screening. Indeed , the development of mobile miniature chest radiography units resulted in an improvement in mass X-rays screening for the detection of penumoconiosis. These mobile miniature units were mounted on a bus chassis , a solution that allowed to easily reach workers. The authors analyze some models of X-ray wagon units used by the `` Clinica del Lavoro '' in Milan in the 1950s. From the point of view of medical museology , the preservation of these devices requires appropriate spaces.
