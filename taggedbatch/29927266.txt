 Binge eating and purging behaviors are associated with significant harm and distress among adolescents. The process by which these behaviors develop ( often in the high school years) is not fully understood. We tested the Acquired Preparedness ( AP) model of risk involving transactions among biological , personality , and psychosocial factors to predict binge eating and purging behavior in a sample of 1,906 children assessed in the spring of 5th grade ( the last year of elementary school) , the fall of 6th grade ( the first year of middle school) , spring of 6th grade , and spring of 10th grade ( second year of high school). Pubertal onset in spring of 5th grade predicted increases in negative urgency , but not negative affect , in the fall of 6th grade. Negative urgency in the fall of 6th grade predicted increases in expectancies for reinforcement from eating in the spring of 6th grade , which in turn predicted increases in binge eating behavior in the spring of 10th grade. Negative affect in the fall of 6th grade predicted increases in thinness expectancies in the spring of 6th grade , which in turn predicted increases in purging in the spring of 10th grade. Results demonstrate similarities and differences in the development of these two different bulimic behaviors. Intervention efforts targeting the risk factors evident in this model may prove fruitful in the treatment of eating disorders characterized by binge eating and purging. ( PsycINFO Database Record
