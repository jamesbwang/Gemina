 An increasing amount of evidence suggests that the delayed effect of antibiotics ( abx) on gut microbiota after its cessation is not as favorable as its immediate effect on host metabolism. However , it is not known how the diverse abx-dependent metabolic effects influence diabetic subjects and how gut microbiota is involved. Here , we treated db/db mice with abx cocktail for 12 days and discontinued for 24 days. We found that db/db mice showed decreased body<symptom> weight and blood glucose after abx treatment , which rapidly caught up after abx cessation. Twenty-four days after abx withdrawal , db/db mice exhibit increased plasma , hepatic total cholesterol ( TC) levels and liver weight. The gut microbiota composition at that time showed decreased relative abundances ( RAs) of Desulfovibrionaceae and Rikenellaceae , increased RA of Erysipelotrichaceae and Mogibacteriaceae , which were correlating with the reduced short-chain fatty acids ( SCFAs) in gut content , such as propionic acid and valeric acid and with the elevated fecal taurine-conjugated bile acids ( BAs) levels. The molecular biology studies showed inhibited hepatic BA synthesis from cholesterol , impeded intracellular transportation and biliary excretion of cholesterol that all conferred to liver TC accumulation. The associations among alterations of gut microbiota composition , microbial metabolite profiles and host phenotypes suggested the existence of gut microbiota-linked mechanisms that mediate the unfavorable delayed effects of abx on db/db mice cholesterol metabolism. Thus , we call upon the caution of applying abx in diabetic animal models for studying microbiota-host interaction and in type 2 diabetes subjects for preventing chronic cardiovascular consequences.
