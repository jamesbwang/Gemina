 Incarcerated women have a disproportionate burden of infectious and chronic<disease> disease<disease> , substance disorders , and mental illness. This study explored incarcerated women 's health and whether a Women 's Health Clinic improved care within this vulnerable population. Retrospective chart reviews and focus groups were conducted. Poor<symptom> access to care in the community due to competing social needs was described. Barriers to care during incarceration included lack of comprehensive gender-specific services , mistrust of providers , and fragmentation. Of 109 women , high rates of mental illness , partner violence , substance use , sexually transmitted infection ( STI) , and irregular Pap testing were observed. Pap ( 15 % to 54 % , p < .001) and STI ( 17 % to 89 % , p < .001) testing rates increased. Fragmentation of care remained at transition points , and further work is needed to improve continuity within corrections and the community.
