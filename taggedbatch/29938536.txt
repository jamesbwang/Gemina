 A theoretical framework serves as a roadmap for the implementation and application of a complex , health promotion intervention; is used to test hypotheses; and guides analysis and evaluation of the intervention. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how a theoretical framework was developed and used to guide the implementation of Healthy Beginning Initiative ( HBI) to promote uptake of HIV<pathogen> services in a low-income country. We used the guide for developing a theoretical framework published in Health Promotion Practice. Developing the theoretical framework included seven steps: ( 1) identifying the essential elements of the intervention; ( 2) identifying the variables and the context; ( 3) listing the postulated mechanisms , mediating variables , and postulated outcomes; ( 4) identifying existing theoretical models supporting the theoretical framework underdevelopment; ( 5) scripting the theoretical framework into either a figure or sets of statements; ( 6) conducting content and face validation of the theoretical framework; and ( 7) revising the theoretical framework. The theoretical framework was developed and used to evaluate HBI 's impact on HIV<pathogen> testing , linkage to care and retention in care for pregnant women , their male partners , and newborns. The theoretical framework will also be adapted for other screenings and other settings while remaining true to the essential elements of HBI.
