 We investigated the intra- and inter-strain diversity of genetic alterations in Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> after exposure to colistin. Four colistin-susceptible K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> strains with different sequence types were exposed to 2 mg/L colistin , the average steady-state plasma concentration. After exposure , ten single-step colistin-resistant mutants were selected in vitro from each K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> strain. Minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs) were evaluated by broth microdilution. Nucleotide sequences of genes associated with colistin resistance ( phoPQ , pmrAB , mgrB , and crrAB) were determined , and the mRNA expression levels of pbgP , phoP , phoQ , pmrD , pmrA , and pmrB were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Colistin MICs for single-step mutants ranged from 4 to > 64 mg/L. Diverse amino acid alterations in pmrB , phoP , phoQ , and mgrB , including insertion sequences , were identified in the colistin-resistant mutants. Different mutations were found even among mutants originating from the same parental strain , and several mutants displayed no mutations in the tested genes. While most colistin-resistant mutants showed elevated expression of pbgP , seven showed no increase compared their susceptible parental strain , and some mutants exhibited no overexpression of pmrAB , phoPQ , or pbgP. Our results demonstrate the diversity of genetic variations in colistin-resistant populations derived from the same parental strain , and suggest that there are still unknown mechanisms of colistin resistance in K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen>.
