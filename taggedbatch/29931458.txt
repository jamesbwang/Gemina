 The total number of people with dementia symptoms is expected to double every 20 years and there will also be an increase in the number of older immigrants in several countries. There are considerable deficiencies in the present knowledge of how to conduct well-functioning health care for immigrants with dementia symptoms. The aim of this study was to explore caring and uncaring encounters between assistant nurses and immigrants in two group homes for persons with dementia symptoms in Sweden: a Finnish-speaking as well as a Swedish-speaking context. In addition , this study aims to describe how caring and uncaring encounters are manifested in these two contexts according to Halldórsdóttir 's theory of `` Caring and Uncaring encounters ''. Descriptive field notes from 30 separate observations were analyzed using qualitative deductive content analysis. The main category `` caring encounters '' focused on reaching out to initiate connection through communication , removing masks of anonymity by acknowledging the unique person , acknowledgment of connection by being personal. Reaching a level of truthfulness by being present and showing respect , raising the level of solidarity by equality and true negotiation of care , based on the residents ' needs. The main category , uncaring encounters , focused on disinterest in and insensitivity towards the other , coldness in the connection and lack of humanity in care situations. The observations showed that caring encounters occurred more in the Finnish-speaking context and uncaring encounters more often in the Swedish context. Encounters could be caring , uncaring , and carried out using a person-centered approach. Communication and relationships could be facilitated using the same language but also through learning to interpret residents ' needs and desires.
