 The human defensins are recently discovered to inhibit potassium channels , which are classical targets of the animal toxins. Whether other vertebrate defensins are potassium channel inhibitors remains unknown. In this work , we reported that the mouse & beta;- defensin 3 ( mBD3) was a novel inhibitor of both endogenous and exogenous potassium channels. The structural analysis showed that mBD3 is the most identical to human Kv1 .3 channel-sensitive human & beta;- defensin 2 ( hBD2). However , the pharmacological profiles indicated that the recombinant mBD3 ( rmBD3) weakly inhibited the mouse and human Kv1 .3 channels. Different from the pharmacological features of human & beta;- defensins , mBD3 more selectively inhibited the mouse Kv1 .6 and human KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels with IC
