 Ligamentous stability and joint congruity are prerequisites for a physiological function of the distal radioulnar joint ( DRUJ). Impingement of the ulnar head may be caused by a congenital ulna-minus variance or by an iatrogenically excessive ulna shortening osteotomy. This impingement is detected by a positive compression test at the DRUJ. Radius correction osteotomy with shortening and correction of the radial inclination to restore the sigmoid notch may solve the problem by reducing the pressure between both joint partners and by promoting the remodelling of the DRUJ. This technique may restore the distal radioulnar joint and thus prevent the necessity of salvage procedures.
