 With the exception of classic functional adenomas in dogs and horses , pituitary lesions<symptom> are infrequently described in the veterinary literature. Approximately 10 % of pituitary glands from asymptomatic humans contain abnormalities , but the equivalent proportion in small animals is unknown. Pituitary glands from 136 dogs and 65 cats collected during routine necropsies were examined to determine the prevalence of pituitary lesions<symptom> and their histopathological diagnosis. Lesions<symptom> were characterized in sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin , periodic acid-Schiff ( PAS) , Gordon and Sweet 's and reticulin stains , and immunohistochemistry for adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH) , growth hormone , melanocyte stimulating hormone-Î± , and prolactin. Pituitary abnormalities were identified in 36 of 136 ( 26.4 %) dogs and 10 of 65 ( 15.3 %) cats. Cystic changes were the most common lesion<symptom> , occurring in 18 ( 13.2 %) dogs and 8 ( 12.3 %) cats. Pituitary neoplasia was detected in 14.1 % ( 12/85) of middle-aged and old dogs; 1 ( 1.5 %) cat had pituitary nodular hyperplasia<disease>. PAS and reticulin stains helped differentiate ACTH-immunoreactive adenomas from hyperplastic nodules<symptom>: adenomas contained PAS-positive intracytoplasmic granules and loss of the normal reticulin network. One dog had a pituitary carcinoma with infiltration into the thalamus. Other pituitary abnormalities included secondary metastases ( 2 dogs) and hypophysitis ( 4 dogs , 1 cat). In most cases , the lesion<symptom> appeared to be subclinical and could be considered incidental , whereas clinical manifestations were apparent in only 4 dogs ( 2.9 %) and none of the cats with pituitary lesions<symptom>. Pituitary abnormalities are common in dogs and cats , and their clinical relevance requires further investigation.
