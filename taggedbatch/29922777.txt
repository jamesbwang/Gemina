 Geometrical and vibrational characterization of magnesium hydroxide was performed using density functional theory. Four possible crystal symmetries were explored: P3 ( combining macron) ( No. 147 , point group -3) , C2/m ( No. 12 , point group 2) , P3m1 ( No. 156 , point group 3m) and P3 ( combining macron) m1 ( No. 164 , point group -3 m) which are the currently accepted geometries found in the literature. While a lot of work has been performed on Mg ( OH)
