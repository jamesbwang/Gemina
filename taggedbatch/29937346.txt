 To compare anatomic single-bundle ( SB) with double-bundle ( DB) anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ( ACL-R) and to evaluate the respective clinical outcome results. In a prospective randomized study , 64 patients were included and separated into 2 groups. Anatomic SB and DB ACL-Rs were performed with hamstring tendons. Five years after surgery , the follow-up ( FU) examination comprised International Knee Documentation Committee ( IKDC) 2000 , Laxitester ( ORTEMA Sport Protection , Markgroeningen , Germany) measurement , and radiograph evaluation. Power calculation was performed to achieve a 95 % confidence interval and 80 % power on the base of 7-point IKDC subjective difference between the groups. A total of 53 patients ( 83 % FU) were examined at 63.2 ± 4.7 months after surgery: 28 patients in the DB group and 25 patients in the SB group. IKDC subjective ( SB: 92.8 ± 6.2 , DB: 91.6 ± 7.1; P = .55) and objective scores ( grade A SB/DB 20 %/ 25 % , B SB/DB 72 %/ 57 % , C SB/DB 8 %/ 18 % , D SB/DB 4 %/ 0 %; P = .45) showed no differences comparing both groups. The Laxitester measurements showed no significant difference in regard to anterior-posterior translation in neutral , internal , and external rotation or to rotation angles ( P = .79). No difference was seen between the groups regarding osteoarthritic changes and tunnel widening. At the 5-year FU , no advantage for either the DB or SB technique in ACL-R can be seen with regard to patient-related and objective outcome measures. Level I , prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.
