 The history of the Wnt pathway is an adventure that takes us from mice and flies to frogs , zebrafish and beyond , sketching the outlines of a molecular signalling cascade along the way. Here , we specifically highlight the instrumental role that developmental biology has played throughout. We take the reader on a journey , starting with developmental genetics studies that identified some of the main molecular players , through developmental model organisms that helped unravel their biochemical function and cell biological activities. Culminating in complex analyses of stem cell fate and dynamic tissue growth , these efforts beautifully illustrate how different disciplines provided missing pieces of a puzzle. Together , they have shaped our mechanistic understanding of the Wnt pathway as a conserved signalling process in development and disease. Today , researchers are still uncovering additional roles for Wnts and other members of this multifaceted signal transduction pathway , opening up promising new avenues for clinical applications.
