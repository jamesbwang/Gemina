 For the first time , this laboratory-scale study evaluates the feasibility of incorporating diffusive exchange in permeable reactive barriers. In order to do this , the performance of two permeable reactive barriers ( PRB) with different internal substrate arrangements were compared during the administration of a sulfate solution without metals ( for 163 days) and with metals ( for 60 days) , simulating groundwater contaminated with acid mine drainage ( AMD). In order to simulate a traditional PRB , a homogeneous distribution was implemented in the first reactor and the other PRB reactor utilized diffusion-active technology ( DAPRB). In the DAPRB , the distribution of the reactive material was interspersed with the conductive material. The measurements in the internal ports showed that transverse gradients of sulfide formed in the DAPRB , causing the diffusion of sulfide from the substrate toward the layer interface , which is where the sulfide reacts by forming complexes with the metal. The DAPRB prevents the microorganisms from direct contact with AMD. This protection caused greater activity ( sulfide production).
