 The study objective was to assess the midterm outcomes and aortic remodeling in patients with Marfan syndrome<disease><symptom> with complicated acute type B aortic dissection treated with stent-assisted , balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination. We reviewed all patients treated with stent-assisted , balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination for a complicated acute type B aortic dissection associated with Marfan syndrome<disease><symptom> according to the revised Ghent criteria. Between 2015 and November 2017 , 7 patients with Marfan syndrome<disease><symptom> underwent stent-assisted , balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination for a complicated acute type B aortic dissection. The median age of patients was 47 years ( range , 23-70). Four patients had a history of aortic root replacement. Technical success was achieved in 100 %. Three patients required an adjunctive procedure for renal artery stenting ( n = 2) and iliac artery stenting ( n = 1). There was no in-hospital death , 30-day postoperative stroke , spinal<disease> cord ischemia , ischemic colitis<disease> , or renal<symptom> failure<symptom> requiring dialysis. At a median follow-up of 15 months ( range , 7-28) , 1 patient required aortic arch replacement for aneurysmal degeneration associated with a type Ia endoleak at 2 years , giving a late reintervention rate of 14 %. There was no other secondary endoleak. The primary visceral patency rate was 100 %. There were no all-cause deaths reported. At last computed tomography scan , all patients had complete aortic remodeling of the treated thoracoabdominal aorta. Distally , at the nonstented infrarenal aortoiliac level , 6 patients had persistent false lumen flow with stable aorto-iliac diameter in 5. One patient had iliac diameter growth ( 27 mm diameter at last computed tomography scan). Stent-assisted , balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination of aortic dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome<disease><symptom> is feasible , safe , and associated with an immediate and midterm persisting thoracoabdominal aortic remodeling.
