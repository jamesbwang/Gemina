 Homooligomerization of proline utilization A ( PutA) bifunctional flavoenzymes is intimately tied to catalytic function and substrate channeling. PutA from Bradyrhizobium japonicum ( BjPutA) is unique among PutAs in that it forms a tetramer in solution. Curiously , a dimeric BjPutA hot spot mutant was previously shown to display wild-type catalytic activity despite lacking the tetrameric structure. These observations raised the question of what is the active oligomeric state of BjPutA. Herein , we investigate the factors that contribute to tetramerization of BjPutA in vitro. Negative-stain electron microscopy indicates that BjPutA is primarily dimeric at nanomolar concentrations , suggesting concentration-dependent tetramerization. Further , sedimentation-velocity analysis of BjPutA at high ( micromolar) concentration reveals that although the binding of active-site ligands does not alter oligomeric state , reduction of the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor results in dimeric protein. Size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering and small-angle x-ray scattering analysis also reveals that reduced BjPutA is dimeric. Taken together , these results suggest that the BjPutA oligomeric state is dependent upon both enzyme concentration and the redox state of the flavin cofactor. This is the first report , to our knowledge , of redox-linked oligomerization in the PutA family.
