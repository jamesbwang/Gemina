 Facilitated Learning Groups ( FLGs) were introduced by the South Australian Psychiatry Branch Training Committee in 2016 to provide support for trainees. These incorporated Balint group principles but also had roles that extended beyond a traditional Balint group. This paper reports an evaluation of these groups after their first 12 months. An evaluation form was sent to all trainee participants , seeking quantitative and qualitative feedback about their experience. The majority of trainees found the FLGs to be beneficial. A thematic analysis of the written feedback revealed several key benefits for the participants , including having access to a senior psychiatrist who was outside of training and supervision , mixing with trainees across years and regions , and the capacity to discuss difficult work environments. A forum for trainees to develop reflective practice and discuss challenging issues , which is not involved in their assessment , was experienced positively by the majority of participants and should be considered for wider adoption across Australia and New Zealand.
