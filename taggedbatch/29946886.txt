 This study aimed to disentangle the effects of Mild-to-Borderline Intellectual Disability ( MBID) and Behavior Disorders ( BD) on risk taking in circumstances where peer influence was absent or present. We studied 319 adolescents in four groups: MBID-only , MBID+BD , BD-only , and typically developing controls. The Balloon Analogue Risk-Task ( BART) , in a solo or peer condition , was used as a proxy of real-life risk-taking. Results show a significant main effect of BART condition. Post-hoc tests indicated higher risk-taking in the peer compared to the solo condition in all groups except BD-only. Moreover , risk taking was increased in adolescents with MBID compared to adolescents without MBID , but only under peer-influence. No main or interaction effects with BD were observed. Model based decomposition of BART performance in underlying processes showed that the MBID related increase in risk-taking under peer-influence was mainly related to increased risk-taking propensity , and in the MBID-only group also to increased safety estimates and increased confidence in these safety estimates. The present study shows that risk-taking in MBID may be better explained by low intellectual functioning than by comorbid BD , and may not originate in increased risk taking per se , but may rather be related to risk-taking under peer-influence , which is a complex , multifaceted risk-taking context. Therefore , interventions to decrease risk-taking by adolescents with MBID that specifically target peer-influence may be successful.
