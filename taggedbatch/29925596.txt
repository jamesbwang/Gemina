 Many large-scale , high-throughput experiments use DNA barcodes , short DNA sequences prepended to DNA libraries , for identification of individuals in pooled biomolecule populations. However , DNA synthesis and sequencing errors confound the correct interpretation of observed barcodes and can lead to significant data loss or spurious results. Widely used error-correcting codes borrowed from computer science ( e.g. , Hamming , Levenshtein codes) do not properly account for insertions and deletions ( indels) in DNA barcodes , even though deletions are the most common type of synthesis error. Here , we present and experimentally validate filled/truncated right end edit ( FREE) barcodes , which correct substitution , insertion , and deletion errors , even when these errors alter the barcode length. FREE barcodes are designed with experimental considerations in mind , including balanced guanine-cytosine ( GC) content , minimal homopolymer runs , and reduced internal hairpin propensity. We generate and include lists of barcodes with different lengths and error correction levels that may be useful in diverse high-throughput applications , including > 10
