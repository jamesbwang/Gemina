 Chemical permeation enhancers ( CPEs) can enable antibiotic flux across the tympanic membrane. Here we study whether combinations of CPEs ( sodium dodecyl sulfate , limonene , and bupivacaine hydrochloride) are synergistic and whether they could increase the peak drug flux. Synergy is studied by isobolographic analysis and combination indices. CPE concentration-response ( i.e. trans-tympanic flux of ciprofloxacin) curves are constructed for each CPE , isobolograms constructed for pairs of CPEs , and synergy demonstrated for all three pairs. Synergy is much greater at earlier ( 6 h) than later ( 48 h) time points , although the effect sizes are greater later. Synergy is also demonstrated with the three-drug combination. Combinations of CPEs also greatly enhance the maximum drug flux achievable over that achieved by individual CPEs.
