 Refractory and super-refractory status epilepticus ( SE) are serious illnesses with a high risk of morbidity and even fatality. In the setting of refractory generalized convulsive SE ( GCSE) , there is ample justification to use continuous infusions of highly sedating medications-usually midazolam , pentobarbital , or propofol. Each of these medications has advantages and disadvantages , and the particulars of their use remain controversial. Continuous EEG monitoring is crucial in guiding the management of these critically ill patients: in diagnosis , in detecting relapse , and in adjusting medications. Forms of SE other than GCSE ( and its continuation in a `` subtle '' or nonconvulsive form) should usually be treated far less aggressively , often with nonsedating anti-seizure drugs ( ASDs). Management of `` non-classic '' NCSE in ICUs is very complicated and controversial , and some cases may require aggressive treatment. One of the largest problems in refractory SE ( RSE) treatment is withdrawing coma-inducing drugs , as the prolonged ICU courses they prompt often lead to additional complications. In drug withdrawal after control of convulsive SE , nonsedating ASDs can assist; medical management is crucial; and some brief seizures<symptom> may have to be tolerated. For the most refractory of cases , immunotherapy , ketamine , ketogenic diet , and focal surgery are among several newer or less standard treatments that can be considered. The morbidity and mortality of RSE is substantial , but many patients survive and even return to normal function , so RSE should be treated promptly and as aggressively as the individual patient and type of SE indicate.
