 We describe an outbreak of hantavirus<pathogen><disease> pulmonary<disease> syndrome<disease><symptom> in the Burruyacú Department , Province of Tucumán. The detection in 2016 of a case of hantavirosis affecting a 23-year-old woman , considered at that time to be the first case occurred in that province , promoted a thorough epidemiological study. The investigation allowed the retrospective detection of another case occurred one month earlier in a 5-year-old child in the same Department. In both cases , the infection was confirmed by serology ( case 1 at days 4 and 7 of disease onset , case 2 at day 4) and the viral genotype was characterized as HU39694. The contacts of both cases were serologically negative for hantavirus<pathogen><disease>. The rodents captured in the area belonged to genus Akodon , genus Calomys<pathogen> and species Mus<pathogen> musculus<pathogen>. Oligoryzomys , the known reservoir for this viral genotype , was not found. Specific anti-hantavirus antibodies were not detected in the captured rodents. Given that the patients had not visited hantavirus<pathogen><disease> endemic areas and their contacts were negative for hantavirus<pathogen><disease> , we infer that the patients were locally exposed to fluids of infected rodents during their usual social or recreational outdoor activities. In conclusion , we demonstrate that hantavirus<pathogen><disease> HU39694- a genotype until now considered to be restricted to the Central Pampas of the country- is circulating in the North<pathogen> Western province of Tucumán. The endemic area of hantavirosis is thus expanded to this province but the viral reservoir in the area has not yet been identified.
