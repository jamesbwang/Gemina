 Vitamin D deficiency is a common occurrence globally , and particularly so in pregnancy. There is conflicting evidence regarding the role of vitamin D during pregnancy in non-skeletal health outcomes for both the mother and the neonate. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of maternal total 25-hydroxy vitamin D ( 25OHD) with neonatal anthropometrics and markers of neonatal glycaemia in the Belfast centre of the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome ( HAPO) study. Serological samples ( n 1585) were obtained from pregnant women in the Royal Jubilee Maternity Hospital , Belfast , Northern Ireland , between 24 and 32 weeks ' gestation as part of the HAPO study. 25OHD concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography tandem-MS. Cord blood and neonatal anthropometric measurements were obtained within 72 h of birth. Statistical analysis was performed. After adjustment for confounders , birth weight standard deviation scores ( SDS) and birth length SDS were significantly associated with maternal total 25OHD. A doubling of maternal 25OHD at 28 weeks ' gestation was associated with mean birth weight SDS and mean birth length SDS higher by 0 · 05 and 0 · 07 , respectively ( both , P = 0 · 03). There were no significant associations with maternal 25OHD and other measures of neonatal anthropometrics or markers of neonatal glycaemia. In conclusion , maternal total 25OHD during pregnancy was independently associated with several neonatal anthropometric measurements; however , this association was relatively weak.
