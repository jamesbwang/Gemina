 In-line and traditional lunge<disease> exercises present differences in technique as lower limb positioning ( anterioposterior) , and medio-lateral ( ML) balance<symptom> may differentially affect primary and stabilizer muscles. The purposes of this study were to examine ML balance<symptom> and muscle activation in anterior and posterior leg positions between in-line and traditional lunge<disease> exercises. Fifteen young , healthy , resistance-trained men ( 25 Â± 5 years) performed 2 different lunge<disease> exercises ( in-line and traditional) at their 10 repetition maximum in a randomized , counterbalanced fashion. Surface electromyography measured muscle activation of the vastus lateralis , biceps femoris , gluteus maximus , and gluteus medius. ML balance<symptom> was measured with a Wii Fit Balance<symptom> Board. The vastus lateralis activity was not significantly different between exercises or leg positions. The biceps femoris activity was not significantly different between exercises , however , it was significantly greater in the anterior compared to the posterior position for the in-line ( p = 0.003) , and traditional lunge<disease> ( p < 0.001). The gluteus maximus activity was not significantly different between exercises , however , it was significantly greater in the anterior compared to posterior position for the in-line ( p < 0.001) and traditional lunge<disease> ( p < 0.001). ML balance<symptom> was significantly greater in the in-line exercise in the anterior limb ( p = 0.001). Thus , both in-line and traditional lunge<disease> exercises presented similar overall levels of muscle activation , yet the anterior limb generated the highest biceps femoral and gluteus maximus muscle activation when compared to the posterior limb. The in-line lunge<disease> presents greater ML balance<symptom> when compared to the traditional lunge<disease> exercise.
