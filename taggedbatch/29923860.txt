 To determine the factors associated with sporadic diffuse lamellar keratitis<disease><symptom> ( DLK) after microkeratome laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis ( LASIK). This large database retrospective study included consecutive cases of LASIK performed between 2007 and 2016 at Care-Vision Laser Centers , Tel-Aviv , Israel. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to whether or not they subsequently developed DLK. A total of 24,026 eyes of 12,013 patients with a mean age of 32.9 ± 10.3 years were included. Post-LASIK DLK developed in 464 eyes ( 1.9 %) , and the annual rate decreased from 7.1 % ( 2007) to 1.7 % ( 2016) ( P < 0.001). The DLK group had a higher proportion of males ( 58.5 % vs. 52.1 % , P = 0.006) , greater preoperative central corneal thickness ( 549.5 ± 32.6 vs. 545.3 ± 30.5 μm , P = 0.005) , and a lower proportion of high astigmatism ( > 3 D) ( 0.4 % vs. 1.6 % , P = 0.05). The DLK group had a higher proportion of previous LASIK treatment ( 2.8 % vs. 1.3 % , P = 0.006) , Moria M2 ( rather than the SBK) microkeratome ( 71.1 % vs. 34.0 % , P < 0.001) , smaller suction ring number ( P < 0.001) , greater stop size ( P < 0.001) , and greater flap thickness ( 119.2 ± 50.4 vs. 110.8 ± 22.2 , P = 0.007). In multivariable analysis , a smaller suction ring number ( odds ratio ( OR) 0.89 , P = 0.04) , Moria M2 microkeratome ( OR 5.26 , P < 0.001) , larger optical zone ( OR = 2.04 , P = 0.01) , and higher spherical equivalent ( OR = 1.08 , P = 0.02) were associated with DLK. In the modern LASIK era , the incidence of DLK continues to decrease. Higher preoperative ametropia , smaller suction ring number , an older type of microkeratome , and larger optical zones are associated with higher DLK rates after LASIK.
