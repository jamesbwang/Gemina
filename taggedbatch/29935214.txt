 This study was conducted to characterize and compare peripheral blood stem cell grafts from healthy donors who underwent granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF) mobilization and subsequently received 1 dose of plerixafor after insufficient stem cell yields were achieved at the first apheresis. Aliquots from 35 donors were collected from the first apheresis after mobilization with G-CSF alone and from the second apheresis after additional plerixafor administration. Samples were freshly analyzed for cellular subsets by 8-color flow cytometry. Leukapheresis samples mobilized with additional plerixafor showed a significant increase of total nucleated cells , including B cells , CD4
