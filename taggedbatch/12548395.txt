 In this work , we aim to analyze and compare the mechanisms controlling the volume of mucus in the bronchial region of the lungs of a healthy human adult<disease> , at rest and in usual atmospheric conditions. This analysis is based on a balance<symptom> equation for the mucus in an airway , completed by a computational tool aiming at characterizing the evaporation , during respiration<symptom> , of the water contained in the bronchial mucus. An idealized representation of the lungs , based on Weibel 's morphometric model , is used. The results indicate that the mechanisms controlling the volume of mucus in an airway depend on the localization of the airway in the bronchial region of the lungs. In the proximal generations , the volume of mucus in an airway is mainly controlled by the evaporation of the water it contains and the replenishment , with water , of the mucus layer by epithelial cells or the submucosal glands. Nevertheless , cilia beating in this part of the bronchial region remains of fundamental importance to transport the mucus and hence to eliminate dust and pathogens trapped in it. On the other hand , in the distal generations of the bronchial region , the volume of mucus in an airway is mainly controlled by the mucociliary transport and by the absorption of liquid by the epithelium. This absorption is a consequence of the mucus displacement by the cilia along generations with an interface between the epithelium and the airway surface layer of decreasing area. The numerical results obtained are in good agreement with previously published experimental data , thus validating our approach. We also briefly discuss how our results can improve the understanding and , possibly , the treatment of pulmonary diseases.
