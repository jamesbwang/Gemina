 Implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD) reduces mortality in selected patients. However , its role in patients older than 75 years is not well established. We performed a retrospective , non-randomized study using a historical cohort from a single centre. Between January 2008 and July 2014 , we assessed patients aged ≥ 75 years with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35 % , identifying 385 patients with a Class I or IIa recommendation for ICD implantation. At the decision of the patient or attending cardiologists , 92 patients received an ICD. To avoid potential confounding factors , we used propensity-score matching. Finally , 126 patients were included ( 63 with ICD). The mean age was 79.1 ± 3.1 years ( 86.5 % male). As compared with the medical therapy group , the ICD patients had a lower percentage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( 19.0 % vs. 38.1 % , P < 0.05) and more frequent use of beta-blockers ( BBs) ( 85.7 vs. 70.0 % , P < 0.05). Other treatments were otherwise similar in both groups. There were no differences related to age , aetiology , or other co-morbidities. During follow-up ( 39.2 ± 22.4 months) , total mortality was 46.0 % and cardiovascular events ( death or hospitalization) occurred in 66.7 % of the patients. A multivariate analysis revealed that only BB therapy was shown to be an independent protective variable with respect to mortality ( hazard ratio 0.4 ( 0.2-0.7)). ICD therapy did not reduce overall mortality or the rate of cardiovascular events. According to our results , the use of ICD , as compared with medical therapy , in patients older than 75 years did not demonstrate any benefit. Well-designed randomized controlled studies in patients older than 75 years are needed to ascertain the value of ICD therapy.
