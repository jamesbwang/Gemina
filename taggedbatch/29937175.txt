 Tumor proliferation often occurs from pathologic receptor upregulation. These receptors provide unique targets for near-infrared ( NIR) probes that have fluorescence-guided surgery ( FGS) applications. We demonstrate the use of three smart-targeted probes in a model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. A dose escalation study was performed using IntegriSense750 , ProSense750EX , and ProSense750FAST in mice ( n = 5) bearing luciferase-positive SCC-1 flank xenograft tumors. Whole body fluorescence imaging was performed serially after intravenous injection using commercially available open-field ( LUNA , Novadaq , Canada) and closed-field NIR systems ( Pearl , LI-COR , Lincoln , NE). An ex vivo , whole-body biodistribution was conducted. Lastly , FGS was performed with IntegriSense750 to demonstrate orthotopic and metastatic disease localization. Disease fluorescence delineation was assessed by tumor-to-background fluorescence ratios ( TBR). Peak TBR values were 3.3 for 1 nmol ProSense750EX , 5.5 for 6 nmol ProSense750FAST , and 10.8 for 4 nmol IntegriSense750 at 5.5 , 3 , and 4 d post administration , respectively. Agent utility is unique: ProSense750FAST provides sufficient contrast quickly ( TBR: 1.5 , 3 h) while IntegriSense750 produces strong ( TBR: 10.8) contrast with extended administration-to-resection time ( 96 h). IntegriSense750 correctly identified all diseased nodes in situ during exploratory surgeries. Ex vivo , whole-body biodistribution was assessed by tumor-to-tissue fluorescence ratios ( TTR). Agents provided sufficient fluorescence contrast to discriminate disease from background , TTR > 1. IntegriSense750 was most robust in neural tissue ( TTR: 64) while ProSense750EX was superior localizing disease against lung tissue ( TBR: 13). All three agents appear effective for FGS.
