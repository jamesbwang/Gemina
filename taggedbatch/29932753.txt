 Elevated dynamic plantar pressures are a consistent finding in diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy , with implications for plantar foot ulceration. This study aimed to investigate whether a first-ray amputation affects plantar pressures and plantar pressure distribution patterns in individuals living with diabetes and peripheral neuropathy. A nonexperimental matched-subject design was conducted. Twenty patients living with diabetes and peripheral neuropathy were recruited. Group 1 ( n = 10) had a first-ray amputation and group 2 ( n = 10) had an intact foot with no history of ulceration. Plantar foot pressures and pressure-time integrals were measured under the second to fourth metatarsophalangeal joints , fifth metatarsophalangeal joint , and heel using a pressure platform. Peak plantar pressures under the second to fourth metatarsophalangeal joints were significantly higher in participants with a first-ray amputation ( P = .008). However , differences under the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint ( P = .734) and heel ( P = .273) were nonsignificant. Pressure-time integrals were significantly higher under the second to fourth metatarsophalangeal joints in participants with a first-ray amputation ( P = .016) and in the heel in the control group ( P = .046). Plantar pressures and pressure-time integrals seem to be significantly higher in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and a first-ray amputation compared with those with diabetic neuropathy and an intact foot. Routine plantar pressure screening , orthotic prescription , and education should be recommended in patients with a first-ray amputation.
