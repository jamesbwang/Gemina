 To investigate morbidity related to harversting of bilateral fibula free flap for head and neck reconstruction using subjective and functional tests. Patients were retrospectively evaluated using point evaluation system ( PES) and balance<symptom> evaluation systems test ( BESTest) questionnaires to assess morbidity related to surgery. Five patients were enrolled in the study. Mean PES scores was 22.2 over 24. Mean overall function assessed with BESTest was 77.6 % , and the results were poorest for section I. Sections V and VI had scores of 88 % and 83 % , respectively , indicating that the sensory balance<symptom> and gait stability of the patients were compromised only minimally. Bilateral harvesting of the fibula free flap is not associated with an increase in long-term morbidity and does not lead to significant functional impairments. Therefore , this procedure should be considered safe , and can be performed without concern regarding morbidity , when bone reconstruction with a fibula free flap is indicated.
