 Cyclization reactions that create complex polycyclic scaffolds are hallmarks of alkaloid biosynthetic pathways. We present the discovery of three homologous cytochrome P450s from three monoterpene indole alkaloid-producing plants ( Rauwolfia serpentina , Gelsemium sempervirens and Catharanthus roseus) that provide entry into two distinct alkaloid classes , the sarpagans and the Î²-carbolines. Our results highlight how a common enzymatic mechanism , guided by related but structurally distinct substrates , leads to either cyclization or aromatization.
