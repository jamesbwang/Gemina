 With the improvement of wastewater discharge standards , wastewater treatment plants ( WWTPs) are continually undergoing technological improvements to meet the evolving standards. In this study , a quartz sand deep bed denitrification filter ( DBDF) was used to purify WWTP secondary effluent , utilizing high nitrate nitrogen concentrations and a low C/N ratio. Results show that more than 90 % of nitrate nitrogen ( NO
