 Maintenance of transcription programs is challenged during mitosis when chromatin becomes condensed and transcription is silenced. How do the daughter cells re-establish the original transcription program? Here , we report that the TATA-binding protein ( TBP) , a key component of the core transcriptional machinery , remains bound globally to active promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells during mitosis. Using live-cell single-molecule imaging , we observed that TBP mitotic binding is highly stable , with an average residence time of minutes , in stark contrast to typical TFs with residence times of seconds. To test the functional effect of mitotic TBP binding , we used a drug-inducible degron system and found that TBP promotes the association of RNA Polymerase II with mitotic chromosomes , and facilitates transcriptional reactivation following mitosis. These results suggest that the core transcriptional machinery promotes efficient transcription maintenance globally.
