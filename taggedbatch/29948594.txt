 Lacosamide , one of the last antiepileptic drugs marketed , can cause extension of PR interval. Precautions are recommended when used in elderly and with other drugs extending PR interval. Cases of severe third-degree atrioventricular block have been reported only in post-marketing case reports when used at high-doses and remain rare. We report the case of an 88-year-old woman treated with bisoprolol , who experienced a complete atrioventricular block after initiation of lacosamide for epilepsy associated with neurodegenerative disease. This dramatic event required a pacemaker implementation. Not being dose-dependent ( initiation dosage used) , it seemed partially explained by drug-drug interaction with bisoprolol.
