 Engaging ocean users , including fishing fleets , in oceanographic and ecological research is a valuable method for collecting high-quality data , improving cost efficiency , and increasing societal appreciation for scientific research. As research partners , fishing fleets provide broad access to and knowledge of the ocean , and fishers are highly motivated to use the data collected to better understand the ecosystems in which they harvest. Here , we discuss recent trends in collaborative research that have increased the capacity of and access to scientific data collection. We also describe common elements of successful collaborative research programs , including definition of a scientific problem and goals , choice of technology , data collection and sampling design , data management and dissemination , and data analysis and communication. Finally , we review four case studies that demonstrate the general principles of effective collaborative research as well as the utility of citizen-collected data for academic research and fisheries management. We also discuss the challenge of funding , particularly as it relates to maintaining collaborative research programs in the long term. We conclude with a discussion of likely future trends. Ultimately , we predict that collaborative research will continue to grow in importance as climate change increasingly impacts ocean ecosystems , commercial fisheries , and the global food supply.
