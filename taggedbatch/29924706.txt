 This historical review describes in the first section endeavors to develop a method to record the normal traffic of impulses in human nerves , designated microneurography. The method was developed in the Department of Clinical Neurophysiology of the Academic Hospital in Uppsala , Sweden , starting in 1965. Microneurography involves the impalement of a peripheral nerve with a tungsten needle electrode. Electrode position is adjusted by hand until activity of interest is discriminated. A similar technique had not previously been tried in animal preparations; hence the large number of successful studies based on recording afferent activity in other mammals did not offer pertinent methodological guidance. For two years , the two scientists involved impaled their own nerves for testing various kinds of needle electrodes and exploring neural systems , while carefully watching for signs of nerve damage. Temporary paresthesiae were common , whereas enduring sequelae never followed. Single unit impulse trains may be discriminated , even those originating from unmyelinated fibers. An explanation for the discrimination of unitary impulses with the coarse electrode employed is inferred on the basis of electrical circumstance of the electrode in the flesh and impulse shapes , as discussed in the second section. Microneurography , and the microstimulation of identified single afferents , combined with psychophysical methods and behavioral tests have generated new knowledge particularly regarding four neural systems , namely the proprioceptive system , the cutaneous mechanoreceptive system , the cutaneous nociceptive system , and the sympathetic efferent system to skin structures and muscular blood vessels. Examples of achievements based on microneurography are presented in the last section.
