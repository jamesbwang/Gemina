 The hippocampus has been a primary region of study with regards to synaptic and functional changes in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) due to its involvement in early stages , specifically area CA1. However , most work in this area has treated CA1 as a homogeneous structure comprised of uniform neural circuits. Yet , there is a plethora of evidence that CA1 varies in its structure and function across anatomical axes. Here I review the heterogeneity of the functional and circuit architecture of hippocampal area CA1 across three primary anatomical axes. I also summarize evidence that AD differentially affects these subregions , as well as hypotheses as to why this may occur.
