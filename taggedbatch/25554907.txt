 Programmable shape-shifting materials can take different physical forms to achieve multifunctionality in a dynamic and controllable manner. Although morphing a shape from 2D to 3D via programmed inhomogeneous local deformations has been demonstrated in various ways , the inverse problem-finding how to program a sheet in order for it to take an arbitrary desired 3D shape-is much harder yet critical to realize specific functions. Here , we address this inverse problem in thin liquid crystal elastomer ( LCE) sheets , where the shape is preprogrammed by precise and local control of the molecular orientation of the liquid crystal monomers. We show how blueprints for arbitrary surface geometries can be generated using approximate numerical methods and how local extrinsic curvatures can be generated to assist in properly converting these geometries into shapes. Backed by faithfully alignable and rapidly lockable LCE chemistry , we precisely embed our designs in LCE sheets using advanced top-down microfabrication techniques. We thus successfully produce flat sheets that , upon thermal activation , take an arbitrary desired shape , such as a face. The general design principles presented here for creating an arbitrary 3D shape will allow for exploration of unmet needs in flexible electronics , metamaterials , aerospace and medical devices , and more.
