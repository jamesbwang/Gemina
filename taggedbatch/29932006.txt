 To review efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist ( GLP-1 RA) semaglutide for type 2 diabetes ( T2D). A literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE using the term semaglutide was completed through April 2018. A search of clinicaltrials.gov was also conducted. English-language studies assessing the efficacy and/or safety of semaglutide were evaluated. Semaglutide is a newly approved GLP-1 RA for the treatment of T2D. Administered once weekly at a dose of 0.5 or 1 mg , it has been compared with placebo , sitagliptin , insulin glargine , a combination of oral antidiabetic therapies , and 2 GLP-1 RAs , exenatide ER and dulaglutide , and demonstrated greater efficacy compared with these therapies. Published data from studies ranging from 30 to 104 weeks duration demonstrate efficacy with decreases in hemoglobin A1C ( A1C) ranging from 1.1 % to 2.2 %. Studies show reductions in weight from 1.4 to 6.5 kg. Semaglutide demonstrated a reduction in the composite outcome of cardiovascular ( CV) death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , or nonfatal stroke compared with placebo in patients at high risk of CV events ( hazard ratio = 0.74; P = 0.02). Common adverse effects include nausea<symptom> , vomiting , and diarrhea<disease><symptom> as seen with other GLP-1 RAs. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Semaglutide represents an attractive GLP-1 RA considering its A1C and weight reduction. It provides patient convenience and high patient satisfaction. Semaglutide is an appealing option for the treatment of T2D as a once-weekly GLP-1 RA with established glycemic , CV , and weight benefits.
