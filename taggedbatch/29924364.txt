 Self-cleaving ribozymes are biologically relevant RNA molecules which catalyze site-specific cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone. Gathering knowledge of their three-dimensional structures is critical toward an in-depth understanding of their function and chemical mechanism. Equally important is collecting information on the folding process and the inherent dynamics of a ribozyme fold. Over the past years , Selective-2 '- Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension ( SHAPE) turned out to be a significant tool to probe secondary and tertiary interactions of diverse RNA species at the single nucleotide level under varying environmental conditions. Small self-cleaving ribozymes , however , have not been investigated by this method so far. Here , we describe SHAPE probing of pre-catalytic folds of the recently discovered ribozyme classes twister , twister-sister ( TS) , pistol and hatchet. The study has implications on Mg2 +- dependent folding and reveals potentially dynamic residues of these ribozymes that are otherwise difficult to identify. For twister , TS and pistol ribozymes the new findings are discussed in the light of their crystal structures , and in case of twister also with respect to a smFRET folding analysis. For the hatchet ribozyme where an atomic resolution structure is not yet available , the SHAPE data challenge the proposed secondary structure model and point at selected residues and putative long-distance interactions that appear crucial for structure formation and cleavage activity.
