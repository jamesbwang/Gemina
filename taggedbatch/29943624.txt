 Upon FDA/EMEA registration for hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) , sorafenib received a broader therapeutic indication than the eligibility criteria of the landmark SHARP trial. This allowed treatment of SHARP non-eligible patients in daily clinical practice. To assess sorafenib efficacy and safety in SHARP eligible and non-eligible patients , and determine the validity of the current therapeutic indication as described by the FDA/EMEA. Consecutive patients treated with sorafenib for advanced HCC at two Dutch tertiary referral centers between 2007 and 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. Primary outcome was overall survival ( OS). Secondary outcomes were time to progression ( TTP) , response rate , adverse events and reasons for discontinuation. Outcomes were compared between SHARP eligible and non-eligible patients. One hundred and ninety-three of 257 ( 75 %) patients were SHARP eligible. SHARP eligible patients ( 9.5 months , 95 % CI 7.7-11.3) had a longer median OS than non-eligible patients ( 5.4 months , 95 % CI 3.6-7.1) ( log-rank p < .001). SHARP non-eligible patients were more often Child-Pugh B , had higher AST and ALT levels and developed more grade 3-4 liver dysfunction ( 44 versus 23 % , p < .001) during treatment. SHARP ineligibility remained the strongest predictor of OS ( HR 1.78 , 95 % CI 1.32-2.41) and an independent predictor of TTP ( HR 1.45 , 95 % CI 1.05-2.00) in multivariable analysis. Landmark trial outcomes of sorafenib for HCC are reproducible in daily practice , provided that the SHARP eligibility criteria are respected. Based on the findings of this and previous studies , sorafenib usage should be restricted to Child-Pugh A patients.
