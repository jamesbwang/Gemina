 Brewery liquid waste ( BLW) , brewery spent grain ( BSG) , apple pomace solid wastes ( APS) , apple pomace ultrafiltration sludge ( APUS) and starch industry waste ( SIW) were evaluated as alternative feedstocks for levulinic acid ( LA) production via microwave-assisted acid-catalyzed thermal hydrolysis. LA production of 204 , 160 , 66 , 49 and 12 g/kg was observed for BLW , BSG , APS , APUS , and SIW , respectively , at 140 °C , 40 g/L substrate concentration ( SC) , 60 min and 2 N HCl ( acid concentration). Based on the screening studies , BLW and BSG were selected for optimization studies using response surface methodology. Maximum LA production of 409 and 341 g/kg for BLW and BSG , respectively were obtained at 160 °C , 4.5 M HCl , 85 g/L SC and 27.5 min. Results demonstrated the possibility of using brewery wastes as promising substrates for economical and higher yield production of LA , a renewable platform chemical and versatile precursor for fuels and chemicals.
