 In the initially published version of this article online in advance of print , a reference ( Ajina , A. & Maher , J. Prospects for combined use of oncolytic viruses and CAR T-cells. J. Immunother. Cancer 5 , 90 ( 2017)) was omitted in error from the following sentence: `` The ability of oncolytic viruses to increase the expression of MHC class I molecules by cancer cells is also predicted to enhance ACT with TILs or TCR-engineered and chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) T cells that target tumour-specific antigens ''. This has been corrected in the HTML and PDF versions of the manuscript.
