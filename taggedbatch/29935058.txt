 Severe aortic stenosis frequently involves the development of left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH) creating a dichotomous hemodynamic state within the coronary circulation. Whilst the increased force of ventricular contraction enhances its resultant relaxation and thus increases the distal diastolic coronary ` suction ' force , the presence of LVH has a potentially opposing effect on ventricular-coronary interplay. The aim of this study was to use non-invasive coronary wave-intensity analysis ( WIA) to separate and measure the sequential effects of outflow-tract obstruction relief and then left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH) regression following intervention for aortic stenosis. 15 patients with unobstructed coronary arteries undergoing aortic valve intervention ( 11 SAVR , 4 TAVI) were successfully assessed before and after intervention , and at 6- and 12-months post-procedure. Coronary WIA was constructed from simultaneously acquired coronary flow from transthoracic echo and pressure from an oscillometric brachial-cuff system. Immediately following intervention , a decline in the BDW was noted ( 9.7 ± 5.7 vs 5.1 ± 3.6 x10 In aortic stenosis , both the outflow-tract gradient and the presence of LVH impact significantly on coronary haemodynamics that can not be appreciated by examining resting coronary flow rates alone. An immediate change in coronary wave-intensity occurs following intervention with further effects appreciable with hypertrophy regression. The improvement in prognosis with treatment is likely to be attributable to both features. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
