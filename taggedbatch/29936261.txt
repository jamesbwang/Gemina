 In plant defense , priming is a physiological process by which a plant prepares to more quickly or aggressively respond to a future biotic or abiotic stress. This unique physiological state can be induced by beneficial microbes or by treatment with natural or synthetic compounds. Priming has been described copiously , mainly in dicots , but the study on the molecular mechanisms regulating the phenomenon is still at its infancy. A fascinating possibility is that epigenetic changes may be the main actors on priming establishment. A more accessible chromatin structure , due to DNA methylation and/or histone modifications , could facilitate a quicker and more potent gene response to a subsequent attack. Here , we investigated the impact of methyl jasmonate ( MeJA)- induced priming on the response efficacy to mechanical wounding of a monocot ( Oryza sativa). In particular , we showed that MeJA primes plants for increased expression of defense-related genes , such as OsBBPI and OsPOX , upon wounding. Finally , we provided evidence that MeJA modulates histone modifications in the promoter region of OsBBPI , as well as changes at genome-wide DNA methylation level. Together these studies corroborate the importance of priming in strengthening plant defense and support the growing evidence that epigenetic regulation plays a pivotal role in priming onset.
