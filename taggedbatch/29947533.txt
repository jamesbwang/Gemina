 The endothelin ( ET) and prorenin/renin/prorenin receptor ( PRR) systems have opposing physiological effects on collecting duct ( CD) salt and water reabsorption. It is unknown if the CD ET and renin/PRR systems interact , hence we examined the effects of deleting CD renin or nephron PRR on CD ET system components. PRR knockout ( KO) mice were polyuric and had markedly increased urinary ET-1 and inner medullary CD ( IMCD) ET-1 mRNA. PRR KO mice had greatly increased IMCD ETA receptor mRNA and protein , while ETB mRNA and protein were decreased. Water loaded wild-type mice with similar polyuria as PRR KO mice had modestly increased urinary ET-1 excretion and inner medullary ET-1 mRNA , while inner medullary ETA and ETB mRNA or protein expression were unaffected. In contrast to PRR KO , CD prorenin/renin KO did not alter ET system components. Taken together , these results suggest that the nephron PRR is involved in regulating CD ET system expression , but this effect may be independent of CD-derived renin.
