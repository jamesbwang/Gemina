 This study examined the association between Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor ( MIF) promoter polymorphisms and granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( GPA) , and MIF 's role in a murine model of granulomatous vasculitis. The human study involved 1077 patients with GPA and controls. Genotyping for the MIF -794 CATT The percentage of individuals carrying > 5 CATT repeats in each MIF allele ( high MIF expressers) was 60.9 % in patients with GPA and 53.7 % in controls ( adjusted p = 0.049). Human MIF gene expression increased proportionally by CATT-length in response to granulomatous stimulation. Mif lung-Tg2.1 mice exhibited more pulmonary granulomas<disease> than WT , which in turn showed more granulomas<disease> than Mif-KO. A significantly higher percentage of Mif lung-Tg2.1 mice died when injected with CAG when compared to Mif-KO or WT , and anti-MIF protected against lethal disease. MIF-dependent neutrophil/macrophage chemokines were elevated in the bronchoalveolar lavage or plasma of Mif lung-Tg2.1 mice. Patients with GPA have an increased frequency of high-expression MIF CATT alleles. Higher MIF expression increased mortality and pulmonary granulomas<disease> while anti-MIF protected mice from lethal disease. MIF blockade in high genotypic MIF expressers may offer a selective pharmacologic therapy for GPA. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
