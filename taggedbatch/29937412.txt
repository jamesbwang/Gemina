 The use of bioprosthetic valves for mitral valve disease has been increasingly popular with both patients and physicians , and current practice uses these valves for increasingly younger patients. However , these valves are known to degenerate over time. Historically , reoperation was the only recourse for a failing bioprosthetic valve. Today , however , percutaneous options exist with the use of transcatheter valve implantation. Determining candidacy for this less invasive option requires careful evaluation with echocardiography. This review is focused on the echocardiographic evaluation required pre- , intra- , and postprocedurally during transcatheter mitral valve insertion.
