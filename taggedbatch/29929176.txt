 There are still not specified mechanisms how beta-glucan molecules are transported into cells. Supposing , beta-glucan toxicity against tumor cells may be related to the overexpression of the transporter responsible for the transport of glucose molecules in the cells. In this case , glucans- polymers composed of glucose units are much more up-taken by tumor than normal cells. Increased GLUT1 ( Glucose Transporter Type 1) expression has been demonstrated earlier in malignant melanomas. GLUT1 expression promotes glucose uptake and cell growth in that cells. Also , in human melanoma tissues a significant correlation between GLUT1 expression and mitotic activity was found. The aim of the study was to verify if oat β-glucan ( OβG) is delivered into cells by GLUT-1 membrane protein. To check it out we blocked GLUT1 transporters by an inhibitor WZB117 and then we investigated cells viability with and without reversible electroporation ( EP). The obtained results bring us to elucidate the mechanism of transport of the OβG into the cells is GLUT-1 dependent and moreover can be supported by EP method.
