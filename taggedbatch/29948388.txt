 Little is known about the outcomes of gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD) in patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD). We compared the efficacy and safety of ESD between CKD and non-CKD patients. From January 2005 to December 2014 , 102 CKD patients underwent ESD for gastric neoplasms at a tertiary medical institution were reviewed retrospectively. A propensity score-matched control group ( 102 patients) was selected from non-CKD patients to compare clinical outcomes between CKD and non-CKD patients. En bloc resection ( 96.1 %) and curative resection ( 88.2 %) rates in the CKD group did not significantly differ from those in the non-CKD group. Median procedure times ( 25.0 vs. 21.5 min , p = 0.734) and perforation risk ( p = 0.480) were similar between groups. The CKD group showed a tendency towards more bleeding events ( p = 0.052) and had a significantly longer hospital stay ( p = 0.001). In a subgroup analysis , stage 3 CKD patients exhibited a bleeding risk comparable to that exhibited by non-CKD patients ( HR 1.35; 95 % CI 0.36-5.06; p = 0.654) , whereas stage 4 ( HR 5.79; 95 % CI 1.52-22.0; p = 0.010) and stage 5 ( HR 4.80; 95 % CI 1.58-14.6; p = 0.006) patients showed higher bleeding risks than non-CKD patients. In a multivariate analysis , stage 4/5 CKD was a significant predictor for bleeding risk ( HR 4.99; 95 % CI 1.32-18.8; p = 0.018). ESD for gastric epithelial neoplasms can be performed in stage 3 CKD patients with comparable efficacy and safety to that performed in non-CKD patients. Stage 4 and 5 CKD patients should be closely monitored for bleeding events after ESD.
