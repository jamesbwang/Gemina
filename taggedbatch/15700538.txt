 The streptozotocin ( STZ)- induced diabetic model is widely used to evaluate the adverse effects of diabetes mellitus ( DM) on spermatogenesis and testicular steroidogenesis. However , the actual mechanism of sub/infertility in DM males needs to be elucidated. To conduct a detailed examination of the testicular histopathology , sperm acrosome reaction ( AR) status , and tyrosine-phosphorylated protein expression in the testis of male mice induced with STZ. Ten ICR mice were divided into two groups ( n = 5/each): control and diabetes induced by multiple low doses of streptozotocin ( MLD-STZ). The control mice were intraperitoneally injected with citrate buffer , whereas MLD-STZ mice were injected with STZ at 40 mg/kg body<symptom> weight for five consecutive days. At the end of the experiment ( day 40) , reproductive parameters , AR status , and the histopathology of the testis and epididymis were evaluated. The expression of testicular tyrosine phosphorylated proteins was examined. Blood glucose levels , AR percentages , and sperm abnormality of STZ group were significantly higher ( p = 0.003 , 0.001 , 0.000) , while sperm concentration was significantly lower ( p = 0.001) compared to control. Histopathology of the seminiferous tubule was classified into 7 types. Additionally , abundant round cells were found in the epididymal lumen of the MLD-STZ mice. Moreover , the intensities of testicular phosphorylated proteins ( 170 , 70 , 36 , 30 , and 25 kDas) were markedly higher and a 120 kDa protein band was noticeably lower in the MLD-STZ mice. MLD-STZ-induced DM causes many testicular histopathologies , precocious sperm AR , and increased expression of testicular phosphorylated proteins. These findings may clarify some mechanisms of sub/infertility in DM males.
