 It is unknown whether a concentrated period of small-sided games and high intensity training is an effective training approach in youth soccer players. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of a concentrated period of soccer specific training on physical fitness in youth players. Nineteen male soccer players , from two teams , participated ( mean ± SD age: 16.2 ± 0.8 years; body mass: 58.2 ± 7.6 kg; height: 170.8 ± 7.7 cm). One team performed 5 days of small-sided games and high intensity training ( SSG & HIT; n = 12) and the other team regular soccer training with 1 day of SSG and HIT ( REG; n = 7) weekly for 4 weeks. The 30-15 intermittent fitness test ( 30-15 IFT) , countermovement jump ( CMJ) and change of direction ( COD) performance were measured pre and post intervention. Heart rate ( HR) and rating of perceived exertion ( RPE) were recorded and session load calculated ( RPE x minutes). Average % of maximum HR and session load were 83 % and 344 AU for the SSG & HIT vs 73 % and 253 AU for the REG ( P < 0.05). 30-15 IFT improved for the SSG & HIT ( from 17.0 ± 1.1 to 18.4 ± 0.8 km/h; p < 0.05; ES = 0.57) with no difference for the REG group ( Pre: 17.9 ± 1.3 , Post: 18.2 ± 1.6 km/h , ES = 0.10). CMJ and COD were unchanged in both groups and no injuries were reported. A 4-week concentrated period of daily SSG & HIT is effective for improving endurance performance in youth soccer players. This was without injuries and without negating performance in power and change of direction.
