 Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist ( NAVA) is expected to improve respiratory outcomes in preterm infants; however , it has not yet been evaluated. We investigated whether NAVA could improve respiratory outcomes and reduce sedation use in extremely low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight infants ( ELBWIs). A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on patient charts at Nagano Children 's Hospital NICU , Japan. Infants who were born at less than 27-weeks gestation were included. We assessed the prevalence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD) , home oxygen therapy ( HOT) , duration of intubation , and sedation use. We investigated the use of NAVA in14 ELBWIs who were born at less than 27-weeks gestation between September 2013 and September 2015 as the NAVA group. A total of 21 ELBWIs born between September 2011 and September 2013 , before NAVA implementation , served as the control group. There were no significant differences in the perinatal background characteristics between the two groups. For respiratory outcomes , no significant between-group differences were found in the prevalence of BPD and HOT or the duration of intubation. The total duration of sedation use was not significantly different between the two groups; however , in the NAVA group , midazolam was discontinued in all cases after the infants were switched to NAVA. NAVA was safe in preterm infants and showed a similar effect compared to conventional ventilation in respiratory outcomes and sedation use in the chronic phase; thus , NAVA could be attempted initially or at least before BPD established , to improve respiratory outcomes in ELBWIs.
