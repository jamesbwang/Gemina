 Various methods of machine learning , supervised and unsupervised , linear and nonlinear , classification and regression , in combination with various types of molecular descriptors , both `` handcrafted '' and `` data-driven , '' are considered in the context of their use in computational toxicology. The use of multiple linear regression , variants of na√Øve Bayes classifier , k-nearest neighbors , support vector machine , decision trees , ensemble learning , random forest<disease> , several types of neural networks , and deep learning is the focus of attention of this review. The role of fragment descriptors , graph mining , and graph kernels is highlighted. The application of unsupervised methods , such as Kohonen 's self-organizing maps and related approaches , which allow for combining predictions with data analysis and visualization , is also considered. The necessity of applying a wide range of machine learning methods in computational toxicology is underlined.
