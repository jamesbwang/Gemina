 Demyelinating diseases , such as multiple sclerosis , are known to result from acute or chronic injury to the myelin sheath and inadequate remyelination. Its underlying molecular mechanisms , however , remain unclear. The transcription factor prospero homeobox 1 ( Prox1) plays an essential role during embryonic development of the central nervous system and cell differentiation. Thus , we aimed to investigate the role of Prox1 in the survival and differentiation of oligodendrocytes. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Flow cytometry was conducted to analyze cell apoptosis. Ectopic-Prox1 and shProx1 were used for the overexpression and knockdown respectively of Prox1 in FBD-102b cells. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to assess the alterations of signaling pathway-related mRNAs and proteins , respectively. Results showed that Prox1 was upregulated in differentiating oligodendrocytes , and Prox1 knockdown inhibited the differentiation of oligodendrocytes. In addition , overexpression of Prox1 promoted oligodendrocyte differentiation , as shown by the change in myelin basic protein expression. The overexpression of Prox1 had no effect on oligodendrocyte survival , while Prox1 knockdown impaired cell survival. Further study demonstrated that Prox1 knockdown promoted oligodendrocyte apoptosis and activated NOXA , a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Knockdown of NOXA by siRNA abrogated Prox1 knockdown-induced apoptosis. Our findings indicated that Prox1 regulated the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells via the regulation of NOXA. Therefore , Prox1 could be a potential modulator of demyelinating diseases in clinical settings.
