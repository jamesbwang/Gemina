 The level of hormones in the tissues of sugar beet leaves of different age in parallel with their growth and metabolic activity was assayed; the latter was analyzed , measuring the contents of sugars and N-containing compounds , and the activities of Rubisco and proteases. The highest auxin and ABA concentration was detected in the actively growing upper leaf , while high level of cytokinins was maintained in the middle and upper leaves characterized by intensive photosynthesis. Leaf senescence being manifested in decline of chlorophyll content , decrease of photosynthesis and activation of proteolysis was accompanied by a decline in concentration of cytokinins. Glucose level gradually increased from upper ( younger) to a lower ( elder) leaves; this was accompanied with the signs of senescence on the background of decreased cytokinins level. Immuno-histochemical technique revealed increased level of abscisic acid in phloem parenchyma of the lowest leaf. The results suggest a possible involvement of auxins in maintaining leaf growth , an implication of decreased cytokinins level in the hypothesized induction of senescence by glucose , and a participation of abscisic acid in the active loading of metabolites into the phloem of senescing leaf.
