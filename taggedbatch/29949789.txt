 Spaceflight negatively influences the function of cartilage tissue in vivo. In vitro human chondrocytes exhibit an altered gene expression of inflammation<symptom> markers after a two-hour exposure to vibration. Little is known about the impact of long-term vibration on chondrocytes. Human cartilage cells were exposed for up to 24 h ( VIB) on a specialised vibration platform ( Vibraplex) simulating the vibration profile which occurs during parabolic flights and compared to static control conditions ( CON). Afterwards , they were investigated by phase-contrast microscopy , rhodamine phalloidin staining , microarray analysis , qPCR and western blot analysis. Morphological investigations revealed no changes between CON and VIB chondrocytes. F-Actin staining showed no alterations of the cytoskeleton in VIB compared with CON cells. DAPI and TUNEL staining did not identify apoptotic cells. ICAM-1 was elevated and vimentin , beta-tubulin and osteopontin proteins were significantly reduced in VIB compared to CON cells. qPCR of cytoskeletal genes , ITGB1 , SOX3 , SOX5 , SOX9 did not reveal differential regulations. Microarray analysis detected 13 differentially expressed genes , mostly indicating unspecific stimulations. Pathway analyses demonstrated interactions of PSMD4 and CNOT7 with ICAM. Long-term vibration did not damage human chondrocytes in vitro. The reduction of osteopontin protein and the down-regulation of PSMD4 and TBX15 gene expression suggest that in vitro long-term vibration might even positively influence cultured chondrocytes.
