 Increasing body size is accompanied by facial elongation across a number of mammalian taxa. This trend forms the basis of a proposed evolutionary rule , cranial evolutionary allometry ( CREA). However , facial length has also been widely associated with the varying mechanical resistance of foods. Here , we combine geometric morphometrics and computational biomechanical analyses to determine whether evolutionary allometry or feeding ecology have been dominant influences on facial elongation across 16 species of kangaroos and relatives ( Macropodiformes). We found no support for an allometric trend. Nor was craniofacial morphology strictly defined by dietary categories , but rather associated with a combination of the mechanical properties of vegetation types and cropping behaviours used to access them. Among species examined here , shorter muzzles coincided with known diets of tough , resistant plant tissues , accessed via active slicing by the anterior dentition. This morphology consistently resulted in increased mechanical efficiency and decreased bone deformation during incisor biting. Longer muzzles , by contrast , aligned with softer foods or feeding behaviours invoking cervical musculature that circumvent the need for hard biting. These findings point to a potential for craniofacial morphology to predict feeding ecology in macropodiforms , which may be useful for species management planning and for inferring palaeoecology.
