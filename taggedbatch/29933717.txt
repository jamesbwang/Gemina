 US hospitals that admitted Ebola<disease> virus<disease> disease<disease> ( EVD) patients mitigated risk by using point-or-care testing ( POCT) for critical support in isolation units. Success proved unequivocally the need for POCT. Additionally , molecular diagnostics have been used to help stop new outbreaks , and even handheld diagnostic solutions are emerging. Areas covered: This update of ` Molecular detection and point-of-care testing in Ebola<disease> virus<disease> disease<disease> and other threats ' ( Expert Reviews 2015; 15 ( 10): 1249-1255) , assesses the impact of EVD epidemics , documents insights from recent reviews , summarizes evolving POC molecular technologies , presents General Accountability Office ( GAO) recommendations , identifies the role of POC Coordinators , and casts a vision for national POCT policies and guidelines. Factual updating comprised summarizing EVD outbreaks including 2017-2018 , analyzing reviews and evidence-based publications since the 2014-2016 epidemic , and tabulating published technical and molecular diagnostics. New graphics illustrate POC error mitigation/risk reduction , a framework for national POCT policy and guidelines , modular adaptations for country-specific solutions , and a logic diagram for future progress embedding artificial intelligence. Expert commentary: The USA is still not prepared for highly infectious<disease> diseases<disease>. Key is lack of community rapid response and resilience , which must be enhanced not via mechanisms distant , but instead by molecular diagnostics directly at critical points of need.
