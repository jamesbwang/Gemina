 Crambe abyssinica is widely cultivated in the off-season in the Midwest region of Brazil with great potential for biodeisel production. Low precipitation is characteristic of this region , which can drastically affect the productivity of C. abyssinica. Signaling molecules , such as nitric oxide ( NO) , can potentially alleviate the effects of water stress on plants. Here we test whether nitric oxide , applied by donor sodium nitroprusside ( SNP) , can alleviate the occurrence of water deficit damages in Crambe plants and maintain physiological and biochemical processes. Crambe plants were sprayed with three doses of SNP ( 0 , 75 , and 150 Î¼M) and were submitted to two water levels ( 100 % and 50 % of the maximum water holding capacity). After 32 and 136 h , leaves were analyzed to evaluate the concentration of NO , water relations , gas exchange , chlorophyll a fluorescence , chloroplastidic pigments , proline , malondialdehyde , hydrogen peroxide , superoxide anions , and the antioxidant enzymes activity. Application of SNP allowed the maintenance of gas exchange , chlorophyll fluorescence parameters , and activities of antioxidant enzymes in plants exposed to water deficit , as well as increased the concentration of NO , proline , chloroplastidic pigments and osmotic potential. The application of SNP also decreased the concentration of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species in plants submitted to water deficit. Thus , the application of SNP prevented the occurrence of symptoms of water deficit in Crambe plants , maintaining the physiological and biochemical responses at reference levels , even under stress conditions.
