 Typically , animals ' food preferences are tested manually , which can be both time-consuming and vulnerable to experimenter biases. Given the utility of ascertaining animals ' food preferences for research and husbandry protocols , developing a quick , reliable , and flexible paradigm would be valuable for expediting many research protocols. Therefore , we evaluated the efficacy of using a touchscreen interface to test nonhuman primates ' food preferences and valuations , adapting previously validated manual methods. We tested a nonhuman primate subject with four foods ( carrot , cucumber , grape , and turnip). Preference testing followed a pairwise forced choice protocol with pairs of food images presented on a touchscreen: The subject was rewarded with whichever food was selected. All six possible pairwise combinations were presented , with 90 trials per pairing. Second , we measured how hard the subject was willing to work to obtain each of the four foods , allowing us to generate demand curves. For this phase , a single image of a food item was presented on the touchscreen that the subject had to select in order to receive the food , and the number of selections required increased following a quarter-log scale , with ten trials per cost level ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 10 , and 18). These methods allowed us to ascertain the subject 's relative preferences and valuations of the four foods. The success of this touchscreen protocol for testing the subject 's food preferences , from both a practical and a theoretical standpoint , suggests that the protocol should be further validated with other foods with this subject , with other subjects , and with other test items.
