 Clasps of removable partial dentures ( RPDs) often suffer from plastic deformation and failure by fatigue<symptom>; a common complication of RPDs. A new technology for processing metal frameworks for dental prostheses based on laser-sintering , which allows for precise fabrication of clasp geometry , has been recently developed. This study sought to propose a novel method for designing circumferential clasps for laser-sintered RPDs to avoid plastic deformation or fatigue<symptom> failure<symptom>. An analytical model for designing clasps with semicircular cross-sections was derived based on mechanics. The Euler-Bernoulli elastic curved beam theory and Castigliano 's energy method were used to relate the stress and undercut with the clasp length , cross-sectional radius , alloy properties , tooth type , and retention force. Finite element analysis ( FEA) was conducted on a case study and the resultant tensile stress and undercut were compared with the analytical model predictions. Pull-out experiments were conducted on laser-sintered cobalt-chromium ( Co-Cr) dental prostheses to validate the analytical model results. The proposed circumferential clasp design model yields results in good agreement with FEA and experiments. The results indicate that Co-Cr circumferential clasps in molars that are 13 mm long engaging undercuts of 0.25 mm should have a cross-section radius of 1.2 mm to provide a retention of 10N and to avoid plastic deformation or fatigue<symptom> failure<symptom>. However , shorter circumferential clasps such as those in premolars present high stresses and can not avoid plastic deformation or fatigue<symptom> failure<symptom>. Laser-sintered Co-Cr circumferential clasps in molars are safe , whereas they are susceptible to failure in premolars.
