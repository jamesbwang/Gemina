 In this work , we describe the preparation and characterization of a biopreparate for efficient and rapid animal glue removal. The biopreparate is based on the extracellular proteolytic enzymes of an Exiguobacterium<pathogen> undae environmental isolate. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that the biopreparate is predominantly composed of hydrolytic enzymes-proteases and peptidases , nucleases , peptide ABC transporter substrate-binding proteins , and a phosphatase. The two main proteins present are bacillolysin and a peptide ABC transporter substrate-binding protein. Inhibition and proteomic analyses of the biopreparate revealed that bacillolysin , a neutral metalloendopeptidase , is mainly responsible for its proteolytic activity. This biopreparate was able to satisfactorily remove two types of animal glue from different kinds of material surfaces. These results suggest that this biopreparate could serve as a potential new tool for the restoration of historical objects rather than living microorganisms.
