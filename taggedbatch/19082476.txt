 One of the molecular mechanisms involved in upper airway-related diseases is epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT). Olea europaea<pathogen> ( OE) has anti-inflammatory properties and thus , great potential to prevent EMT. This study aimed to investigate the effect of OE on EMT in primary nasal human<pathogen> respiratory epithelial cells ( RECs). Respiratory epithelial cells were isolated and divided into four groups: control ( untreated) , treated with 0.05 % OE ( OE group) , EMT induced with 5 ng/ml of transforming growth factor beta-1 ( TGFβ1 group) and treated with 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 + 0.05 % OE ( TGFβ1 + OE group). The effects of OE treatment on growth kinetics , morphology and protein expression in RECs were evaluated. Immunocytochemistry analysis was performed to quantitate the total percentage of E-cadherin and vimentin expression from day 1 to day 3. There were no significant differences between untreated RECs and OE-treated RECs in terms of their morphology , growth kinetics and protein expression. Induction with TGFβ1 caused RECs to have an elongated spindle shape , a slower proliferation rate , a higher expression of vimentin and a lower expression of E-cadherin compared with the control. Cells in the TGFβ1 + OE group had similar epithelial shape to untreated group however it had no significant differences in their proliferation rate when compared to TGFβ1-induced RECs. Cells treated with TGFβ1 + OE showed significantly reduced expression of vimentin and increased expression of E-cadherin compared with the TGFβ1 group ( P < 0.05). The ability of OE to inhibit EMT in RECs was shown by TGFb1-induced EMT REC morphology , growth kinetics and protein expression markers ( E-cadherin and vimentin) upon treatment with OE and TGFβ1. Therefore , this study could provide insight into the therapeutic potential of OE to inhibit pathological tissue remodelling and persistent inflammation<symptom>.
