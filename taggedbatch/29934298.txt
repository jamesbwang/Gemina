 To develop novel crop-breeding strategies , it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction between plants and their pathogens. Network modelling represents a powerful tool that can unravel properties of complex biological systems. In this study , we aimed to use network modelling to better understand immune signalling in potato. For this , we first built on a reliable Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana L.) immune signalling model , extending it with the information from diverse publicly available resources. Next , we translated the resulting prior knowledge network ( 20,012 nodes , 70,091 connections) to potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.) and superimposed it with an ensemble network inferred from time-resolved transcriptomics data for potato. We used different network modelling approaches to generate specific hypotheses of potato immune signalling mechanisms. An interesting finding was the identification of a string of molecular events illuminating the ethylene pathway modulation of the salicylic acid pathway through NPR1 gene expression. Functional validations confirmed this modulation , thus supporting the potential of our integrative network modelling approach for unravelling molecular mechanisms in complex systems. In addition , this approach can ultimately result in improved breeding strategies for potato and other sensitive crops.
