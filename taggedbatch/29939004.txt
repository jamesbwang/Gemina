 Re-engineering cellular components and biological processes has received great interest and promised compelling advantages in applications ranging from basic cell biology to biomedicine. With the advent of DNA nanotechnology , the programmable self-assembly ability makes DNA an appealing candidate for rational design of artificial components with different structures and functions. This Forum Article summarizes recent developments of DNA nanotechnology in mimicking the structures and functions of existing cellular components. We highlight key successes in the achievements of DNA-based biomimetic membrane proteins and discuss the assembly behavior of these artificial proteins. Then , we focus on the construction of higher-order structures by DNA nanotechnology to recreate cell-like structures. Finally , we explore the current challenges and speculate on future directions of DNA nanotechnology in biomimetics.
