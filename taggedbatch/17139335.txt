 Recent studies have revealed that newly emerging transformed cells are often eliminated from epithelia via cell competition with the surrounding normal epithelial cells. However , it remains unknown whether and how soluble factors are involved in this cancer preventive phenomenon. By performing stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC)- based quantitative mass spectrometric analyses , we have identified ADAM-like Decysin-1 ( ADAMDEC1) as a soluble protein whose expression is upregulated in the mix culture of normal and RasV12-transformed epithelial cells. Expression of ADAMDEC1 is elevated in normal epithelial cells co-cultured with RasV12 cells. Knockdown of ADAMDEC1 in the surrounding normal cells substantially suppresses apical extrusion of RasV12 cells , suggesting that ADAMDEC1 secreted by normal cells positively regulate the elimination of the neighboring transformed cells. In addition , we show that the metalloproteinase activity of ADAMDEC1 is dispensable for the regulation of apical extrusion. Furthermore , ADAMDEC1 facilitates the accumulation of filamin , a crucial regulator of Epithelial Defense Against Cancer ( EDAC) , in normal cells at the interface with RasV12 cells. This is the first report demonstrating that an epithelial intrinsic soluble factor is involved in cell competition in mammals.
