 The provincial wildlife management agency , British Columbia Ministry of Forests , Lands , Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development , performed a translocation to control the urban mule deer ( Two hundred free-ranging mule deer were captured in urban and non-urban environments in the Kootenay region from 2014 to 2017. BCS and morphometric examinations were performed for each deer. Blood samples collected from each deer were tested for exposure to selected pathogens and pregnancy status. Body condition scores averaged 3.4 on a five-point scale , was greater in nuMD , and significantly differed between years. Antibodies were detected for adenovirus<pathogen> hemorrhagic<disease> disease<disease><pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( 38.4 % ( uMD 43.7 % , nuMD 33.3 %)) , bluetongue virus ( 0.6 % ( uMD 1.2 % , nuMD 0 %)) , bovine respiratory<pathogen><disease> syncytial<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( 8.4 % ( uMD 4.6 % , nuMD 12.1 %)) , bovine viral diarrhea<disease><symptom> virus ( 1.1 % ( uMD 0 % , nuMD 2.2 %)) , bovine parainfluenza-3 virus ( 27.0 % ( uMD 27.6 % , nuMD 26.4 %)) , Comparison of BCS , pregnancy rates and pathogen exposure of uMD and nuMD showed that the health of the two populations did not significantly differ , suggesting uMD translocations do not pose a severe risk of pathogen transmission between mule deer populations and that these selected pathogens do not factor in the decline of the nuMD population. However , inclusion of additional health indicators and creation of a robust predictive disease model are warranted to further characterize the health of mule deer and the health risks associated with uMD translocations. These results should be considered as part of a formal risk assessment for future uMD translocations in southeastern British Columbia.
