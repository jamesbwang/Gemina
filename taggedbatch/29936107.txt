 5-Aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy ( ALA-PDT) has been used in the treatment of various precancerous and malignant lesions<symptom>. Our previous work has demonstrated that ALA-PDT possesses the potential to serve as an adjuvant therapy against head and neck cancer via eliminating the cancer stem cells ( CSCs) property. This study aimed to further investigate the possible molecular mechanism underlying the effect of ALA-PDT. Our results revealed that ALA-PDT upregulated the expression of microRNA-145 ( miR-145) in two oral cancer cell lines. Overexpression of miR-145 in oral CSCs further enhanced the treatment effect of ALA-PDT with lower self-renewal , invasion capacities and reduced CD44 expression , while inhibition of miR-145 exhibited the opposite phenomena. These findings suggest that the anti-CSCs effect of ALA-PDT is due to an elevation of miR-145.
