 Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( cSCC) occurs 65-200 times more in immunosuppressed organ transplant patients than in the general population. T cells , which are targeted by the given immunosuppressive drugs , are involved in anti-tumor immune surveillance and are functionally regulated by DNA methylation. Prior to kidney transplantation , we aim to discover differentially methylated regions ( DMRs) in T cells involved in de novo post-transplant cSCC development. We matched 27 kidney transplant patients with a future de novo cSCC after transplantation to 27 kidney transplant patients without cSCC and studied genome-wide DNA methylation of T cells prior to transplantation. From 11 out of the 27 cSCC patients , the DNA methylation of T cells after transplantation was also examined to assess stability of the observed differences in DNA methylation. Raw methylation values obtained with the 450k array were confirmed with pyrosequencing. We found 16 DMRs between patients with a future cSCC and those who do not develop this complication after transplantation. The majority of the DMRs were located in regulatory genomic regions such as flanking bivalent transcription start sites and bivalent enhancer regions , and most of the DMRs contained CpG islands. Examples of genes annotated to the DMRs are This is the first study demonstrating that DNA methylation of T cells from patients with a future de novo post-transplant cSCC is different from patients without cSCC. These results were obtained before transplantation , a clinically relevant time point for cSCC risk assessment. Several DNA methylation profiles remained relatively stable after transplantation , concluding that these are minimally affected by the transplantation and possibly have a lasting effect on post-transplant cSCC development.
