 A substantial majority of global population owns cellular phones independently to demographic factors like age , economic status , and educational attainment. In this study , we investigated the diversity of microorganisms associated with cellular phones of 27 individuals using cultivation-based methods. Cellular phones were sampled using cotton swabs and a total of 554 isolates representing different morphotypes were obtained on four growth media. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight ( MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry could generate protein profiles for 527 isolates and species-level identification was obtained for 415 isolates. A dendrogram was constructed based on the protein profiles of the remaining isolates , to group 112 isolates under 39 different proteotypes. The representative strains of each group were selected for 16S rRNA gene and ITS region sequencing based identification.
