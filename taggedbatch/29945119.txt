 Scanning transmission electron microscopy ( STEM) imaging using diffraction contrast is a powerful technique to assess crystal defects. In this work it is used to assess the spatial distribution of radiation induced defect in tungsten. In effect , its irradiation leads to the formation of nanometric dislocation loops that under certain conditions may form intriguing 3-D rafts. In this study , we have irradiated thin tungsten samples in situ in a TEM with 1.2 MeV W ions to 0.017 dpa at room temperature ( RT) and at 700 Â°C. Besides the Burgers vector analysis , the number density and size of the dislocation loops with their spatial arrangement were quantitatively characterized by stereo imaging in STEM mode. Most of the loops have a Burgers vector 1/2 a
