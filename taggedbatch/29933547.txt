 Wastewater is an important vector of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes ( ARB/G). While there is broad agreement that ARB/G from agricultural ( ag) wastewaters can be transported through the environment and may contribute to untreatable infectious<disease> disease<disease> in humans and animals , there remain large knowledge gaps surrounding applied details on the types and amounts of ARB/G associated with different agricultural wastewater treatment options and different ag production systems. This study evaluates a vegetative treatment system ( VTS) built to treat the wastewater from a beef cattle feedlot. Samples were collected for three years , and plated on multiple media types to enumerate tetracycline and cefotaxime-resistant bacteria. Enterobacteriaceae isolates (
