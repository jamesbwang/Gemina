 Epidemiological studies have provided ambiguous evidence on the association between vitamin E and esophageal cancer risk. To resolve this controversy , we performed this meta-analysis. The literature was searched by using Excerpta Medica Database ( EMBASE) , PubMed , the Web of Science , and the Cochrane Library from the inception to April 2018. A random effect model was utilized to calculate the odds ratio ( OR) with the 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI). Twelve articles reporting 14 studies involving 3013 cases and 11,384 non-cases were included. By comparing the highest category with the lowest category of dietary vitamin E intake , we found that dietary vitamin E intake was inversely related to esophageal cancer risk ( OR = 0.47 , 95 % CI: 0.36 ⁻ 0.60). Subgroup analysis revealed that dietary vitamin E intake had a significantly negative association with both the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma risk ( OR = 0.29 , 95 % CI: 0.18 ⁻ 0.44) and the esophageal adenocarcinoma risk ( OR = 0.66 , 95 % CI: 0.49 ⁻ 0.88). No study significantly affected the findings in the sensitivity analysis. Publication bias was discovered , however , the OR ( 95 % CI) remained unchanged after the trim-and-fill analysis. This meta-analysis showed that the higher dietary vitamin E intake is associated with a lower esophageal cancer risk. However , the association still needs to be upheld by more large-scaled randomized controlled trials and prospective studies.
