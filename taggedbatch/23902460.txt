 Intraspecific plant functional trait variation provides mechanistic insight into persistence and can infer population adaptive capacity. However , most studies explore intraspecific trait variation in systems where geographic and environmental distances co-vary. Such a design reduces the certainty of trait-environment associations , and it is imperative for studies that make trait-environment associations be conducted in systems where environmental distance varies independently of geographic distance. Here we explored trait variation in such a system , and aimed to: ( i) quantify trait variation of parent and offspring generations , and associate this variation to parental environments; ( ii) determine the traits which best explain population differences; ( iii) compare parent and offspring trait-trait relationships. We characterized 15 plant functional traits in eight populations of a shrub with a maximum separation ca. 100 km. Populations differed markedly in aridity and elevation , and environmental distance varied independently of geographic distance. We measured traits in parent populations collected in the field , as well as their offspring reared in greenhouse conditions. Parent traits regularly associated with their environment. These associations were largely lost in the offspring generation , indicating considerable phenotypic plasticity. An ordination of parent traits showed clear structure with strong influence of leaf area , specific leaf area , stomatal traits , isotope Î´
