 The present study is focused on the separation and characterization of lignin samples isolated by Klason method from European beech ( Fagus sylvatica) broadleaf hardwood and European aspen ( Populus tremula) broadleaf softwood by size-exclusion chromatography. The separation was carried out using dimethylformamide as major component of the mobile phase and a 3 mm id microbore column packed with hydroxyethyl methacrylate gel , calibrated with polystyrene standards. The influence of mobile phase composition and sample solvent composition on the chromatographic behavior and molar mass distributions was investigated.
