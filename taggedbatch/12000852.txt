 The pathologic relationship linking obesity and lipid dismetabolism with earlier onset of aging-related disorders , including cardiovascular disease ( CVD) and type-2 diabetes ( T2D) , is not fully elucidate. Chronic<disease> inflammatory state , in obese individuals , may accelerate cellular aging. However , leukocyte telomere length ( LTL) , the cellular biological aging indicator , is elusively linked with obesity. Recent studies indicate that sterol 27-hydroxylase ( CYP27A1) is an emerging antiatherogenic enzyme , that , by converting extrahepatic cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol , facilitates cholesterol removal Obese subjects from SPHERE project ( Higher LTL attrition was found in severe-obese than overweight individuals ( Our study supports evidence that CYP27A1 genetic characterization identifies persons at higher risk to develop CVD and T2D , on which better converge preventive measures , and opens new perspectives on mechanisms that link obesity with aging-related disorders.
