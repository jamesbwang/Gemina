 Immunotherapy treatment with checkpoint inhibitors ( CPI) ( CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitors) significantly improves survival in a number of cancers. Treatment can be limited by immune-mediated adverse effects including endocrinopathies such as hypophysitis , adrenalitis , thyroiditis and diabetes mellitus. If endocrinopathies ( particularly hypocortisolemia) are not recognized early , they can be fatal. The diagnosis and management of endocrinopathies can be complicated by simultaneous multi-organ immune adverse effects. Here , we present Endocrine Emergency Guidance for the acute management of the endocrine complications of checkpoint inhibitor therapy , the first specialty-specific guidance with Endocrinology , Oncology and Acute Medicine input and endorsed by the Society for Endocrinology Clinical Committee. We present algorithms for management: endocrine assessment and management of patients in the first 24 hours who present life-threateningly unwell ( CTCAE grade 3-4) and the appropriate management of mild-moderately unwell patients ( CTCAE grade 1-2) presenting with features compatible with an endocrinopathy. Other important considerations in relation to hypohysitis and the maintenance of glucocorticoid therapy are discussed.
