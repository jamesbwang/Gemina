 The bacterium<pathogen> Vibrio<pathogen> alginolyticus<pathogen> , an opportunistic pathogen in humans , has a type III secretion system ( T3SS) that is responsible for its cytotoxicity toward eukaryotic cells. The effector of T3SS that is responsible for the cytotoxicity had not been identified. Here we demonstrate that VepA , a homolog of the T3SS effector in V.<pathogen> parahaemolyticus<pathogen> , is required for cytotoxicity in V.<pathogen> alginolyticus<pathogen>. VepA induces lysosomal membrane permeabilization , and it allows the leakage of only small molecules into the cytosol. Our findings revealed that VepA induces cathepsin-independent cell death in mammalian cells. The ferrous ion , one of the small molecules in the lysosome contents , appears to be involved in the cell death caused by V.<pathogen> alginolyticus<pathogen> VepA.
