 The International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision ( ISCEV) standard for full-field electroretinography ( ERG) describes a minimum procedure , but encourages more extensive testing. This ISCEV extended protocol describes an extension to the ERG standard , namely the dark-adapted ( DA) red flash ERG. The DA red flash ERG can be incorporated conveniently within the ISCEV standard ERG protocol after a minimum of 20-min DA and recorded after the DA 0.01 ERG to a flash strength of 0.3 phot cd s m
