 To analyze the association between sleep duration and athletic performance , and provide scientific basis to improve the 50 m and endurance performance in children and adolescents. All the 119 462 subjects aged 9-15 years in both genders were sampled from 2014 National Physical Fitness and Health Surveillance by using stratified random cluster sampling method , to measure the height , weight , 50 meters and endurance performance and investigate sleep duration with questionnaire. Their body mass indexes ( BMI) were calculated and the students ' 50 m , endurance run scores and sleep durations were assessed. Binary Logistic regression was used to analyze the difference between the different sleep groups , and multi factor Logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between the sleep condition and athletic performance. The prevalence of insufficient sleep was 94.67 % in the total subjects , the prevalence was higher among the girls ( 95.26 %) than the boys ( 94.09 % , Ï‡ The prevalence of insufficient sleep has increased , and the sleep condition in children and adolescents is severe. Children and adolescents with sufficient sleep have better athletic performance , so we should strengthen the prevention and control of the lack of sleep in children and adolescents.
