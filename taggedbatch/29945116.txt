 Many alternative and complementary therapies for cancer have been reported. The objective of the present work is to examine antitumor and immune-modulatory properties of dual-treatment based on levamisole ( Lms) and/or taurine ( Tau) in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma-bearing mice. In the current study , Lms ( 10 mg/kg; subcutaneously) and Tau ( 640 mg/kg; intragastrically) was administered alone or as a dual-treatment. Lms or Tau was administered in combination with cyclophosphamide ( CTX) ( 100 mg/kg; intraperitoneal) in mice bearing Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. Treatment with CTX or ( Lms plus Tau) significantly reduced the ascitic tumor cell count , percentage of tumor cell viability while elevated the tumor inhibition rate and apoptosis percentage compared to non-treated animals. Dual-treatment ( Lms and CTX) or ( Tau and CTX) significantly potentiated the reduction of the ascitic tumor cell count , viability and augmented the tumor inhibition rate and apoptosis percentage compared to CTX-treated mice. Dual-treatment of ( Lms plus Tau) , ( Lms plus CTX) or ( Tau plus CTX) altered splenocytes immunological profile of CD3
