 The synthesis of new Pt ( II) complexes bearing tailored cyclometalated C ^ N * N ^ C luminophores is reported along with their photophysical properties. The emission of the monomeric species can be blue shifted upon formal isosteric replacement of two C-H units by N atoms at the two cyclometalating rings. Their remarkable stability upon sublimation was demonstrated by means of scanning tunneling microscopy , which also revealed a defined self-assembly behavior leading to supramolecular arrays , showing a 3-fold symmetry in 2D-confined monolayers. The supramolecular organization is driven by van der Waals interactions of the side chains and does not depend on the nature of the luminophores , as also observed in the crystalline phases showing no significant Pt-Pt interactions in 3D. Conversely , the luminescence properties in glassy matrices at 77 K and in amorphous solids are indicative of intermolecular interactions with sizable intermetallic coupling , which was demonstrated by reproducing the emission spectra of dimeric species by means of ( TD) DFT calculations. The tendency toward aggregation was also traceable by cyclic voltammetry , whereas thermogravimetric analyses confirmed their stability. Solution-processed and vacuum-deposited OLED devices showed a concentration-dependent electroluminescence that red shifts with increasing doping ratios. Due to the stability of the complexes , solution-processed and vacuum-deposited devices showed identical electroluminescence spectra. Besides favoring aggregation , introduction of two N atoms has a detrimental effect on the device performance , due to the prolonged excited-state lifetimes favoring triplet-triplet annihilation.
