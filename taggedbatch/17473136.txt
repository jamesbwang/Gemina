 Medial column ( deltoid ligament) integrity is of key importance when considering the stability of isolated lateral malleolus ankle fractures.Weight-bearing radiographs are the best method of evaluating stability of isolated distal fibula fractures.Computed tomography ( CT) scanning is mandatory for the assessment of complex ankle fractures , especially those involving the posterior malleolus.Most isolated trans-syndesmotic fibular fractures ( Weber-B , SER , AO 44-B) are stable and can safely be treated non-operatively. Posterior malleolus fractures , regardless of size , should be considered for surgical fixation to restore stability , reduce the need for syndesmosis fixation , and improve contact pressure distribution.
