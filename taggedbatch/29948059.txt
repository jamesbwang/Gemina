 To determine whether morphological changes can occur in the splenic artery ( SPA) of autoimmune pancreatitis<disease> ( AIP) cases , and if present , to compare them with those in pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PAC) to clarify any arterial morphological differences between AIP and PAC. A total of 101 AIP cases were included in this study. The presence or absence of morphological change in the SPA was assessed , using arterial phase axial computed tomography images. Subsequently , imaging parameters ( imaging pattern , capsule-like rim , other organ involvement , splenic vein ( SPV) stenosis , and SPA calcification) were compared between cases with and without morphological changes. Additionally , comparison analyses ( visual SPA assessment and % minimal lumen diameter ( MLD) stenosis) among normal pancreas , PAC , and AIP groups were performed using early arterial phase ( EAP) reconstructed images. In 25 ( 24.8 %) AIP cases , marginal irregularities of the SPA were present. The presence of the capsule-like rim and SPV stenosis were significantly associated with the arterial morphological changes. All cases with morphological changes had a capsule-like rim. Visual assessment using EAP reconstructed images revealed irregularities of the SPA in 9 of 38 AIP cases ( 23.7 %); however , arterial narrowing was not detected in any cases. % MLD stenosis in AIP group was significantly lower than that in PAC group ( p < 0.0001). Although approximately one-quarter of AIP cases potentially demonstrate marginal irregularity in the SPA when it is surrounded by an apparent capsule-like rim , arterial luminal narrowing rarely occurs in contrast to PAC. These arterial findings can help to distinguish AIP from PAC.
