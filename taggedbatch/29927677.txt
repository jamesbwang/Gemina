 Accumulating data demonstrate that oxidative stress may play a crucial role in obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD). This study aimed to investigate the role of 8-F2-isoprostane , thioredoxin ( Trx) , and thioredoxin reductase ( TrxR) in children with OCD. Thirty-three drug-free children with OCD and 35 healthy controls were included in this study. The severity of OCD symptoms was assessed via the Children 's Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. The severity of anxiety<symptom> levels was determined through the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders. Plasma levels of 8-F2-isoprostane , Trx , and TrxR were measured using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Plasma 8-F2-isoprostane , Trx , and TrxR levels did not show any significant differences between patient and control groups. There were no significant correlations between plasma levels of these antioxidants and severity of OCD. Findings of this study did not support the involvement of oxidative stress in the etiology of childhood OCD.
