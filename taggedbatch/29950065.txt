 With Bupleurum smithii var. parvifolium and B. scorzonerifolium as test objects , in order to provide a theoretical basis for the introduction and domestication of B. smithii var. parvifolium , the growth and development dynamics of seedlings , biomass accumulation , the content of malonaldehyde ( MDA) , the activity of antioxidase such as SOD , POD , CAT and APX between them were comparatively analyzed by direct sowing culture in the open field. The results indicated that the morphological index and the biomass accumulation of B. smithii var. parvifolium such as root diameter , root length , plant height and leaf number were inferior to B. scorzonerifolium , the antioxidase SOD and POD activity of B. smithii var. parvifolium was significantly inferior to B. scorzonerifolium (
