 Nicotine exposure during gestation is associated with a higher risk of adverse behavioral outcomes including a heightened liability for dependency to drugs of abuse , which can exhibit drug-specificity influenced by gender. This enhanced liability suggests that nicotine use during pregnancy alters neural development in circuits involved in motivation and reward-based learning. The ventral tegmental area ( VTA) is critical in motivated behaviors and we hypothesized that gestational exposure to nicotine alters the development of excitatory circuits in this nucleus. Accordingly , in VTA brain slices from male and female mice exposed to nicotine during the prenatal period ( PNE) and controls , we compared cellular rises in calcium induced by AMPA receptor and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR) stimulation by use of the ratiometric calcium binding dye , Fura-2AM. We found that AMPA induced smaller amplitude calcium rises in the PNE VTA , which was an effect only detected in males. Further , while the amplitude did not vary between treatment and control in females , a greater number of cells responded with rises in calcium in the PNE. Conversely , the proportions of cells responding with calcium rises induced by nAChR stimulation did not change in either gender according to treatment. However , larger rises in calcium in PNE females were detected. When taken together our data show that excitatory signaling in the VTA is altered in a gender-specific manner by PNE and suggest that alterations in signaling could play a role in drug-specific differences in maladaptive , motivated behaviors exhibited by males and females born to mothers exposed to nicotine during pregnancy.
