 Influenza<pathogen><disease> is a serious public health concern , resulting in morbidity , mortality and significant expense to healthcare systems worldwide. Annual vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza<pathogen><disease>. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization in Canada recommends that everyone six months of age and older without contraindications should be vaccinated. The Canadian province of Nova Scotia implemented a publicly-funded universal influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccination program in the 2010-2011 influenza<pathogen><disease> season. In 2013 , pharmacists in Nova Scotia gained the authority to provide a variety of vaccinations , including the publicly-funded influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccine. This study aimed to investigate any changes in influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccine coverage following the implementation of each policy change: 1) universal publicly-funded program and 2) universal publicly-funded program with the addition of pharmacists. Influenza<pathogen><disease> seasons evaluated were from 2006-2007 to 2015-2016. Coverage was estimated by examining Nova Scotia census data with aggregate immunization administration data , including the total number of vaccinations administered according to vaccine provider ( physician , public health or pharmacist) , geographic region , vaccine recipient age and year. The analysis showed an increase in influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccine coverage immediately following the implementation of the two studied policy changes. Vaccine coverage increased from 36.4 to 38 % following the implementation of the universally funded vaccine policy. Following the implementation of pharmacists as immunizers , coverage increased from 35.7 to 41.7 %. Vaccine coverage was highest in those 65 years of age and older during all years evaluated. Physicians provided the highest proportion of vaccines during all study periods , however a decreasing trend through all periods was observed. Physicians proportionately provided more vaccines in urban areas; whereas pharmacist and public health immunization providers in rural areas provided proportionately more vaccinations than their urban counterparts. The addition of a universally funded vaccination policy and the addition of pharmacists as providers of the influenza<pathogen><disease> vaccine resulted in increases in vaccine coverage initially. Additional research is needed to determine the long-term impacts of the policy changes on vaccination coverage and to identify other important factors affecting vaccine uptake.
