 Obstruction in the ureter flow path is one of the most common problems in urinary-related diseases. As the ureter transports the urine using the expansion bolus created by the peristaltic pulses , an obstruction in its path can cause unwanted backflow and can also result in damage to the wall. But in order to understand this further , and specifically to quantify and parametrize the effect of the obstruction in the ureter , a detailed study investigating various level of obstructions in peristaltic ureter flow is necessary. In the current study , full 3D numerical simulations of peristalsis in an obstructed ureter are carried out using a finite element solver along with a two-way coupling between the fluid and structural domain with the arbitrary Eulerian-Lagrangian method. Analysis of the results shows that the larger the obstruction , the higher the wall shear stress and pressure gradient in the fluid. In addition , the amount of backflow increases with increase in the obstruction.
