 We demonstrate a novel charge-free reverse wormlike micelle ( RWLM) consisting of a ternary mixture of a nonionic amphiphilic block copolymer , fatty acid alkyl ester oil , and water under ambient conditions. Nonionic amphiphile tetra- ( poly ( oxyethylene)- poly ( oxybutylene)) pentaerythrityl ether ( TEBPE) self-assembled into spheroid-type micelles in nonaqueous media isopropyl myristate ( IPM) with viscosity comparable to that of IPM. The addition of water increases viscosity only slightly up to a certain concentration of water and then drastically , demonstrating the sphere-to-wormlike micelle transition as confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering. Further increase in water decreases the viscosity after attaining a maximum value. The zero shear viscosity ( Î·
