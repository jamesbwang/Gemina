 The purpose of this review is to summarize the current and emerging therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD). Coinciding with new standardized care guidelines , there are a growing number of therapeutic options to treat males with DMD. Treatment of the underlying pathobiology , such as micro-dystrophin gene replacement , exon skipping , stop codon read-through agents , and utrophin modulators showed variable success in animal and human studies. Symptomatic therapies to target muscle ischemia , enhance muscle regeneration , prevent muscle fibrosis<disease> , inhibit myostatin , and reduce inflammation<symptom> are also under investigation. DMD is a complex , heterogeneous degenerative disease. The pharmacological and technological achievements made in recent years , plus timely supportive interventions will likely lead to an improved quality of life for many individuals with DMD.
