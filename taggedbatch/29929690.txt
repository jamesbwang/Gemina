 Proximal humerus , humeral shaft , and distal humerus fractures are all common adult fractures , and often occur in older patients. While the treatment of proximal humerus fractures remains controversial , certain fractures benefit from plate fixation such as fracture-dislocations and head-split fractures. When plate fixation is chosen , anatomic reduction and restoration of the medial calcar are important for successful results. Further research is required to minimize complications and determine the optimal surgical candidates for plate fixation. Humeral shaft fractures are generally treated non-operatively. However , certain shaft fractures warrant plate fixation , such as open fractures , those with associated forearm fractures , and those in poly-trauma patients. Choice of surgical approach and plate depends on the location and type of the fracture. The majority of intra-articular distal humerus fractures should be treated with plate fixation. Dual plating is generally accepted as the gold standard treatment , while the optimal surgical approach and plate configuration requires more research.
