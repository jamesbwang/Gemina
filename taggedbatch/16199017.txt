 Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) is characterised by the concomitant occurrence of impaired social interaction; restricted , perseverative and stereotypical behaviour; and abnormal communication skills. Recent epidemiological studies have reported a dramatic increase in the prevalence of ASD with as many as 1 in every 59 children being diagnosed with ASD. The fact that ASD appears to be principally genetically driven , and may be reversible postnatally , has raised the exciting possibility of using gene therapy as a disease-modifying treatment. Such therapies have already started to seriously impact on human<disease> disease<disease> and particularly monogenic disorders ( e.g. metachromatic leukodystrophy , SMA type 1). In regard to ASD , technical advances in both our capacity to model the disorder in animals and also our ability to deliver genes to the central nervous system ( CNS) have led to the first preclinical studies in monogenic ASD , involving both gene replacement and silencing. Furthermore , our increasing awareness and understanding of common dysregulated pathways in ASD have broadened gene therapy 's potential scope to include various polygenic ASDs. As this review highlights , despite a number of outstanding challenges , gene therapy has excellent potential to address cognitive dysfunction in ASD.
