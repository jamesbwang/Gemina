 The major concern with the use of some synthetic excipients is their safety towards biological tissues , hence influencing the reliability of products. With the aim to minimize dependency on highly toxic synthetic excipients , the present study was designed to deliver metronidazole ( MNZ) into the colonic region for localized treatment of amoebiasis using natural polysaccharide-based drug delivery. Compression-coated tablets were prepared using water extractable natural polysaccharide from Trigonella foenum-graecum ( FG). Physical properties of the tablets were evaluated and dissolution study was performed at pH 1.2 , 6.8 , and 7.4 with rat cecal material. Results indicate that all batches demonstrated pH-dependent drug release and prevented release into the stomach , allowing traces into the intestine and highest availability into the colon.
