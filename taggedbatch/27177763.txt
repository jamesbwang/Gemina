 Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) is associated with well-established macrostructural and cellular markers , including localized brain atrophy and deposition of amyloid. However , there is growing recognition of the link between cerebrovascular dysfunction and AD , supported by continuous experimental evidence in the animal and human literature. As a result , neuroimaging studies of AD are increasingly aiming to incorporate vascular measures , exemplified by measures of cerebrovascular reactivity ( CVR). CVR is a measure that is rooted in clinical practice , and as non-invasive CVR-mapping techniques become more widely available , routine CVR mapping may open up new avenues of investigation into the development of AD. This review focuses on the use of MRI to map CVR , paying specific attention to recent developments in MRI methodology and on the emerging stimulus-free approaches to CVR mapping. It also summarizes the biological basis for the vascular contribution to AD , and provides critical perspective on the choice of CVR-mapping techniques amongst frail populations.
