 Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Respiratory<disease> Disease<disease> Outcomes ( U-BIOPRED) was initiated in the first year of the Innovative Medicines Initiative ( IMI). It was an ambitious plan to tackle the understanding of asthma through an integration of clinical and multi- ` omics approaches that necessitated the bringing together of industry , academic , and patient representatives because it was too large to be managed by any one of the partners in isolation. It was a novel experience for all concerned. In this review , we describe the main features of the U-BIOPRED experience from the industry perspective. We list some of the key advantages and learnings from the perspective of the authors , and also improvements that we feel could be made in future projects.
