 Hypothalamic leptin receptor ( LR) signaling regulates body<symptom> weight by balancing food intake and energy expenditure. It is well established that the human LR undergoes ectodomain shedding , but little is known about the fate of the remaining cytosolic domain. This study demonstrates that regulated intramembrane proteolysis ( RIP) releases the LR intracellular domain ( LR ICD) , which translocates to the mitochondria where it binds to SOCS6. This LR ICD-SOCS6 interaction stabilizes both proteins on the mitochondrial outer membrane and requires a functional BC box in SOCS6 for mitochondrial association and a central motif in the LR ICD for SOCS6 binding. The LR ICD prevents CCCP-induced mitochondrial depolarization and mitophagy as shown by lowered Parkin translocation and p62 accumulation. Strict regulation of mitochondrial dynamics in the hypothalamus is known to be essential for body<symptom> weight homeostasis. This is the first study showing that the LR can directly modulate mitochondrial biology.
