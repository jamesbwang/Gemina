 UV and NIR-responsive monoolein ( MO) cubic phase was prepared by including poly ( ethyleneimine) ( PEI)/ cinnamic acid ( CA) conjugate and gold nanoparticle ( GNP) within its structure. UV irradiation elevated significantly the release % of Auramine O loaded in cubic phase containing PEI/CA , possibly because of the trans-to-cis isomerization of CA. NIR irradiation also increased significantly the release % of FITC-dextran loaded in cubic phase containing PEI/CA. The release % of the dye loaded in cubic phase containing PEI/CA and GNP was elevated more markedly by NIR irradiation , possibly due to the phase transition of cubic phase and the disassembling of PEI/CA assembly.
