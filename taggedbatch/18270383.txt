 Increased susceptibility to concussions and longer recovery times among high school athletes compared with older athletes ( 1) make concussions among youths playing a sport or being physically active an area of concern. Short-term and long-term sequelae of concussions can include cognitive , affective , and behavioral changes ( 1). Surveillance methods used to monitor concussions among youths likely underestimate the prevalence. Estimates assessed from emergency departments miss concussions treated outside hospitals , those generated using high school athletic trainer reports miss concussions sustained outside of school-based sports ( 2) , and both sources miss medically untreated concussions. To estimate the prevalence of concussions among U.S. high school students related to playing a sport or being physically active , CDC analyzed data from the 2017 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey ( YRBS). Overall , 15.1 % of students ( approximately 2.5 million *) reported having at least one of these concussions during the 12 months before the survey , and 6.0 % reported two or more concussions. Concussion prevalence was significantly higher among male students than among female students and among students who played on a sports team than among students who did not. Among all sex , grade , and racial/ethnic subgroups , the odds of reporting a concussion increased significantly with the number of sports teams on which students played. These findings underscore the need to 1) foster a culture of safety in which concussion prevention and management is explicitly addressed; 2) expand efforts to educate students , parents , coaches , and health care providers regarding the risk for concussion; and 3) identify programs , policies , and practices that prevent concussions.
