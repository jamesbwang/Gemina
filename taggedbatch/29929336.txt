 Despite a sustained effort in surveying flame retardants ( FRs) in wildlife from industrialized regions , their occurrence in birds or any other wildlife species spanning the Arctic regions , particularly in North<pathogen> America , has received limited attention. This study investigated in the top predator glaucous gull ( Larus hyperboreus) breeding in the Eastern<disease> Canadian Arctic ( Cape Dorset , Nunavut) a comprehensive suite of FRs including unstudied halogenated and non-halogenated FRs of potential health concern , along with legacy organochlorines and mercury. The influence of diet acquired locally and in wintering areas on the tissue contaminant profiles was also investigated using Î´
