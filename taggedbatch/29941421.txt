 Horizontal gene transfer ( HGT) is a driving force for bacterial evolution that occurs via conjugation , transduction , and transformation. Whereas conjugation and transduction depend on nonbacterial vehicles , transformation is considered a naturally occurring process in which naked DNA molecules are taken up by a competent recipient cell. Here , we report that HGT occurred between two
