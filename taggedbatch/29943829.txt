 Obesity has become a global epidemic influencing the establishment and progression of a wide range of diseases , such as diabetes , cardiovascular disease , and cancer. In 2016 , International Agency for Research on Cancer reported that obesity is now associated with 13 different cancers , one of which is multiple myeloma ( MM) , a destructive cancer of plasma cells that predominantly reside in the bone<disease> marrow. Obesity is the accumulation of excess<symptom> body fat , which causes metabolic , endocrine , immunologic , and inflammatory-like changes. Obesity is usually associated with an increase in visceral and/or subcutaneous fat; however , an additional fat depot that also responds to diet-induced changes is bone<disease> marrow adipose tissue ( BMAT). There have been several studies over the past few decades that have identified BMAT as a key driver in MM progression. Adipocytes secrete numerous adipokines , such as leptin , adiponectin , resistin , adipsin , and visfatin , which when secreted at normal controlled levels have protective properties. However , in obesity these levels of secretion change , coupled with an increase in adipocyte number and size causing a profound and lasting effect on the bone microenvironment , contributing to MM cell growth , survival , and migration as well as potentially fueling bone destruction. Obesity is a modifiable risk factor making it an attractive option for targeted therapy. This review discusses the link between obesity , monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance ( a benign condition that precedes MM) , and myeloma , and the contribution of key adipokines to disease establishment and progression.
