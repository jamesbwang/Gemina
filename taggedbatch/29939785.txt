 Ants are emerging model systems to study cellular signaling because distinct castes possess different physiologic phenotypes within the same colony. Here we studied the functionality of inotocin signaling , an insect ortholog of mammalian oxytocin ( OT) , which was recently discovered in ants. In Lasius ants , we determined that specialization within the colony , seasonal factors , and physiologic conditions down-regulated the expression of the OT-like signaling system. Given this natural variation , we interrogated its function using RNAi knockdowns. Next-generation RNA sequencing of OT-like precursor knock-down ants highlighted its role in the regulation of genes involved in metabolism. Knock-down ants exhibited higher walking activity and increased self-grooming in the brood chamber. We propose that OT-like signaling in ants is important for regulating metabolic processes and locomotion.-Liutkevičiūtė , Z. , Gil-Mansilla , E. , Eder , T. , Casillas-Pérez , B. , Di Giglio , M.
