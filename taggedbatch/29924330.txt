 Little is known about the relationships between diet cost , dietary intake and obesity in Chinese populations. This study explored how diet cost was related to diet quality and obesity among school-aged children in Southwest China. Data from a cross-sectional study was analysed. Diet cost was estimated based on dietary intake assessed with 24-h dietary recalls and retail food prices. Diet quality was measured using the Chinese Children Dietary Index. Body height , weight , waist circumference and skinfold thicknesses were measured , and their body mass index standard deviation score ( BMISDS) , waist-to-height ratio ( WHtR) , fat mass index ( FMI) and fat-free mass index ( FFMI) were calculated. Multivariate regression models were used to explore the relevance of diet cost to diet quality and obesity. After adjustment for potential confounders , a positive association was observed between diet quality and energy-adjusted diet cost ( β = 0.143 , 95 % confidence interval , CI: 0.014-0.285 , Pfor-trend = 0.0006). Energy-adjusted diet cost also showed a positive association with FMI ( β = 0.0354 , 95 % CI: 0.0001-0.0709 , Pfor-trend = 0.01) , BMISDS ( β = 0.0200 , 95 % CI: 0.0006-0.0394 , Pfor-trend = 0.002) and WHtR ( β = 0.0010 , 95 % CI: 0.0003-0.0017 , Pfor-trend = 0.02). Energy-adjusted diet cost was independently and positively associated with diet quality and obesity among Chinese school-aged children.
