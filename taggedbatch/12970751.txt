 Hypoxia has been reported to be a critical microenvironmental factor that induces cancer metastasis and proliferation in gastric , liver and hepatic cancers; however , the underlying mechanisms of this are largely unknown. Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) have emerged as crucial factors of several aspects of tumor malignancy , including tumorigenesis , metastasis and chemoresistance. However , the potential association of lncRNAs with hypoxia-induced cancer malignancy remains to be determined. In the present study , the differential expression of lncRNAs following the induction of hypoxia in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells was analyzed reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. It was identified that the lncRNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript-1 ( MALAT-1) was upregulated significantly by hypoxia in A549 cells. By considering its promotive effects on malignant tumor behaviors , in the present study , it was identified that upregulated MALAT-1 released the binding of PTB-associated splicing factor ( PSF) to its target gene , GAGE6 , and thus promoted proliferation , migration and invasion of A549 cells following hypoxia exposure. These results advance the overall understanding of the mechanism of hypoxia-induced lung cancer metastasis and may assist in the development of novel therapeutics.
