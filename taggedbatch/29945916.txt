 Estimation of the predissected descending aortic diameter is important for deciding on the size of a stent graft in cases of acute aortic dissection. However , no equations for estimating this diameter have been previously reported. We developed and validated new equations by investigating computed tomography images that were scanned within 3 years before dissection and those that were scanned immediately after the onset of dissection. Among 1127 patients with acute aortic dissection ( 425 type A and 702 type B) , 36 were matched for the study from October 2005 to March 2017 at 4 centers. New equations were developed in 17 patients and validated in 19 patients. We measured the predissected whole circumference length ( CL) and postdissected whole CL , true lumen CL , the major diameter , and the minor diameter of the acutely dissected aorta , followed by calculation of ( post-trueCL + post-wholeCL)/ 2 and ( post-major diameter + post-minor diameter)/ 2. Six equations ( linear function) and modified equations were derived from each of the above-mentioned parameters. In the derivation sets , equations that used the parameter of ( post-trueCL + post-wholeCL)/ 2 were strongly correlated with pre-wholeCL ( Y = 0.9433 x +5.0147; Our newly developed equations can be used to calculate the predissected aortic diameter in cases of acute aortic dissection and might help to decide the size of the stent graft.
