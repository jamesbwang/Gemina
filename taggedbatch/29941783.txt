 In this study , we demonstrate an easy and reliable solution-processed technique using an extra adductive in the perovskite precursor solution. Using this method , a dense and uniform morphology with full surface coverage and highly fluorescent films with nanoscale crystal grains can be obtained. The high exciton binding energy in the resulting films employing octylammonium bromide ( OAB) adductives proved that high fluorescence originated from the quantum confinement effect. The corresponding perovskite light-emitting diodes ( PeLEDs) that were based on this technique also exhibited excellent device performance.
