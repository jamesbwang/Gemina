 One of the major challenges in vaccine design has been the over dependence on incorporation of abundant adjuvants , which in fact is in violation of the `` minimalist '' principle. In the present study , a compact nanovaccine derived from a near whole antigen ( up to 97 wt %) was developed. The nanovaccine structure was stabilized by free cysteines within each antigen ( ovalbumin , OVA) , which were tempospatially exposed and heat-driven to form an extensive intermolecular disulfide network. This process enables the engineering of a nanovaccine upon integration of the danger signal ( CpG-SH) into the network during the synthetic process. The 50 nm-sized nanovaccine was developed comprising approximately 500 antigen molecules per nanoparticle. The nanovaccine prophylactically protected 70 % of mice from tumorigenesis ( 0 % for the control group) in murine B16-OVA melanoma. Significant tumor inhibition was achieved by strongly nanovaccine-induced cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This strategy can be adapted for the future design of vaccine for a minimalist composition in clinical settings.
