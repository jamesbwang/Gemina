 Inflammatory reactions associated with osteolysis and aseptic loosening are the result of wear particles generated at the articulating surfaces of implant components. The aim of the present study was to analyze the biological response of human osteoblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) after exposure to metallic and alumina ceramic particles regarding cellular differentiation , cytokine release , and monocyte migration. Cells were exposed to particles ( 0.01 and 0.05 mg/ml) from an alumina matrix composite ( AMC) ceramic and a CoCr28Mo6 alloy with an average size of 0.5 Âµm over 48 and 96 h. The expression rates of osteogenic (
