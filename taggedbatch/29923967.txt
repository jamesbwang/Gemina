 Kimura disease has been known as a chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> of unknown etiology , since the first report in 1937 and characterized by an increased eosinophil fraction in peripheral blood , increased serum immunoglobulin E ( IgE) levels , and lymphoid granuloma<disease> with eosinophilic infiltration on histopathological examination. The authors present a 30-year-old man who visited their clinic with a 3-month history of protrusion and conjunctival injection of the right eye. Surgical mass resection was performed , and initial histopathology revealed Kimura disease. Additional immunohistochemical examination revealed IgG4-related disease in another hospital , which showed more than 80 IgG4-positive plasma cells per high-power field and an IgG4 +/ IgG + ratio more than 40 %. There are histopathological similarities , and several reports have suggested a relationship between Kimura disease and IgG4-related disease. Thus , it is difficult to classify them as completely different diseases. Kimura disease and IgG4 can be considered a part of a clinical spectrum of abnormal immune reactions.
