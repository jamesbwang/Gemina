 The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of several anesthetics in the brachyuran crab Neohelice granulata , an emergent experimental model. The essential oils ( EOs) of Lippia alba , Aloysia tryphilla , and Melaleuca alternifolia ( tea tree oil; TTO) , the isolated compounds eugenol , menthol , terpinen-4-ol , and the nanoencapsulated form of TTO , were administered in one or more of the following ways: added to the water ( immersion) , through an arthrodial membrane ( injected) , or by oral gavage. Unexpectedly , most EOs did not produce an anesthetic effect after immersion. Only TTO and eugenol induced anesthesia by immersion , with very long induction and recovery times compared to anesthesia of other crustaceans. However , a good anesthetic effect was observed with the injection of terpinen-4-ol and nanoencapsulated TTO in N. granulata; both demonstrated ideal induction and recovery times. These substances appear to be promising anesthetic alternatives for crustaceans.
