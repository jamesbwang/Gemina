 To determine whether distance to a tertiary care facility affects outcomes for locally advanced cervical cancer and to evaluate the impact of receiving care at non-specialized centers in rural communities. Retrospective , single institution study of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer managed with chemo-radiation from January 1 , 2000 to June 1 , 2014. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare progression free and overall survival for patients by median distance to the tertiary care facility ( < 72 miles or > 72 miles) and facility where treatment was received. 180 patients met inclusion criteria. There was no difference in PFS or OS between the travel distance cohorts. When compared by location of external beam radiation , patients treated at outside facilities were older ( p = 0.02) and significantly more likely to be insured ( 95.6 % versus 71.7 % , p < 0.0002). There were more recurrences among patients treated at outside facilities ( 31.1 % versus 15.8 %) but this was non-significant ( p = 0.24). On multivariable analysis , FIGO stage and insurance status were associated with overall survival. Uninsured patients had a significantly increased hazard risk of death as compared to privately insured patients ( HR 3.85 95 % CI 3.07-4.64 , p = 0.0008). Median distance to a tertiary care facility had no significant impact on PFS or OS , however treating facility for radiation may influence recurrence rates. Having non-private insurance or being uninsured is significantly associated with increased risk of death and speaks to the many barriers these patients face.
