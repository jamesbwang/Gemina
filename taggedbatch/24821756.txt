 Numerous studies in applied pedagogical design have shown that , at all educational levels , direct exposure to the natural environment can enhance learning by improving student attention and behaviors. Implementing green walls-a `` vertical garden , '' or `` living wall '' interior wall that typically includes greenery , a growing medium ( soil or substrate) and a water delivery system-provides environmental health benefits , but also provides a practical application within classrooms for minimizing directed attention fatigue<symptom> in students by connecting them to `` outdoor nature '' within the indoor environment. Hands-on `` project-based '' learning is another pedagogical strategy that has proved to be effective across the spectrum of educational levels and across subject areas. Green<symptom> walls have the potential to inspire critical thinking through a combination of project-based learning strategies and environmental education. The authors have outlined a curriculum involving the implementation of an indoor living wall system within a classroom-learning environment , incorporating project-based learning modules that interact with the wall. In conjunction with the passive health benefits of a green wall , project-based curriculum models can connect students interactively with indoor nature and have the potential to inspire real-world thinking related to science , technology , engineering , art , and mathematics fields within the indoor learning environment. Through a combination of these passive and interactive modes , students are connected to nature in the indoor environment regardless of weather conditions outdoors. Future research direction could include post-construction studies of the effectiveness of project-based curricula related to living walls , and the long-term impacts of implementing green walls in classrooms on school achievement and student behaviors.
