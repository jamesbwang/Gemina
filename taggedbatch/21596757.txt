 Geriatrics training is essential for future primary care providers. The Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes ( ECHO) model improves access to specialty care via case-based videoconferencing , but Project ECHO has not previously been designed to target residents. We designed Project ECHO-Geriatrics to deliver geriatrics education to primary care trainees using the ECHO model and evaluated self-rated geriatrics competency of trainees from the University of Washington Family Medicine Residency Network programs who participated between January 2016 and March 2017. We assessed outcomes of Project ECHO-Geriatrics through anonymous surveys. Participants rated didactics , case discussions , and geriatrics-specific knowledge before and after sessions on a 5-point scale ( 1 , low , to 5 , high). Participants were asked whether they planned to do anything differently in their practice and , if yes , to describe this change. Fifteen sessions were held with 204 unique participants from 12 sites , with an average of 28 ( range , 13-41) participants per session. From the 9 of 29 ( 31 %) Family Medicine Residency Network programs that enrolled , 63 % percent ( 116 of 184) of eligible residents attended. Sessions were highly rated ( 89 % of responses were 4 or 5). Self-reported geriatrics-specific knowledge increased significantly ( before 3.3 ( SD = 0.89) versus after 4.0 ( SD = 0.60) , Project ECHO-Geriatrics is an innovative , feasible way to train the future primary care workforce in geriatrics and grow the capacity to provide high-quality care to older adults.
