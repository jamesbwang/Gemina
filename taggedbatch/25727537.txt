 This study reports a medium-term follow-up of a randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA) in ultra-high risk for psychosis ( UHR) patients. Primary outcomes of interest were transition to psychosis and symptomatic and functional outcome. A secondary aim was to investigate clinical predictors of medium-term outcome. Three hundred four UHR participants were recruited across 10 specialised early psychosis services in Australia , Asia , and Europe. The intervention consisted of 1.4 g/daily of omega-3 PUFA or placebo , plus up to 20 sessions of cognitive-behavioural case management ( CBCM) , over the 6-month study period , with participants receiving further CBCM sessions on basis of need between months 6-12. Mean time to follow-up was 3.4 ( median = 3.3; SD = 0.9) years. There was a modest increase in transitions between 12-month and medium-term follow-up ( 11-13 %) and substantial improvement in symptoms and functioning between baseline and follow-up , with no differences between the treatment groups. Most improvement had been achieved by end of the intervention. 55 % of the sample received mental health treatment between end of intervention and follow-up. Omega-3 PUFA did not provide additional benefits to good quality psychosocial intervention over the medium term. Although most improvement had been achieved by end of intervention the substantial rates of post-intervention mental health service use indicate longer-term clinical need in UHR patients. The post-intervention phase treatment or the longer-term effect of CBCM , or a combination of the two , may have contributed to maintaining the gains achieved during the intervention phase and prevented significant deterioration after this time.
