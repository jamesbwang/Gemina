 Atopic dermatitis<disease> ( AD) requires long-term management , mainly with topical anti-inflammatory agents. Topical corticosteroids ( TCS) and tacrolimus ointment ( TAC-O) are recommended as first-line treatments for AD. However , the long-term use of TCS is limited by cutaneous adverse events such as skin atrophy. For TAC-O , Japanese and US labelings were updated in 2003 and 2006 , respectively , to include a boxed warning about a theoretical risk of skin cancer and lymphoma in patients treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors. However , TAC-O has been used worldwide for longer than 15 years to treat adult and pediatric patients with AD. Available data suggest that TAC-O is effective and well tolerated , and can improve quality of life. TAC-O has successfully been used in the proactive management of AD consisting of long-term intermittent use to prevent , delay or reduce the occurrence of AD flares. Systemic drug absorption after TAC-O application is negligible and unlikely to result in systemic immunosuppression. There is currently no strong evidence of an increased rate of malignancy in treated patients , and observational data from postmarketing surveillance studies have shown no safety concerns. In the absence of robust evidence , the warning about the carcinogenic potential in the Japanese labeling for TAC-O does not appear justified and should be reconsidered. This mitigation of description would allow adult and pediatric patients with AD to receive the effective treatment more appropriately.
