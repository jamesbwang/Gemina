 Magnoliae<pathogen> Flos ( MF) is a traditional medicinal herb used for managing rhinitis , sinusitis<disease> and headache<symptom>. The purpose of the present study was to determine the neuroprotective effect of MF against glutamate-induced oxidative stress and to assess the underlying mechanism. Glutamate is a major endogenous excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and contributes to the development of neurodegenerative diseases by excessive activation. MF extract was subjected to a neuroprotective effect assay in HT22 mouse hippocampal cells. The mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of MF extract was evaluated by assaying reactive oxygen species ( ROS) levels , intracellular Ca
