 Motor neuron disease ( MND) refers to a spectrum of degenerative diseases affecting motor neurons. Recent clinical and postmortem observations have revealed considerable variability in the phenotype. Rhythmic involuntary oscillations of the hands during action , resembling tremor<symptom> , can occur in MND , but its pathophysiology has not yet been investigated. 120 consecutive MND patients were screened for tremor<symptom>. Twelve patients with action tremor<symptom> and no other movement disorders were found. Ten took part in the study. Tremor<symptom> was recorded bilaterally using surface electromyography and triaxial accelerometer , with and without a variable weight load. Power spectra of rectified electromyography and accelerometric signal were calculated. To investigate a possible cerebellar involvement , eye blink classic conditioning ( EBCC) was performed in five patients. Action tremor<symptom> was present in about 10 % of our population. All patients showed distal postural tremor<symptom> of low amplitude and constant frequency , bilateral with a small degree of asymmetry. Two of them showed also simple kinetic tremor<symptom>. A peak at the electromyography and accelerometric recordings ranging from 4 Hz to 12 Hz was found in all patients. Loading did not change peak frequency in either the electromyographic or accelerometric power spectra. Compared with healthy volunteers , patients had a smaller number of conditioned responses during EBCC. our data suggest that MND patients can present with action tremor<symptom> of a central origin , possibly due to a cerebellar dysfunction. This evidence supports the novel idea of MND as a multisystem neurodegenerative disease and that action tremor<symptom> can be part of this condition. This article is protected by copyright.
