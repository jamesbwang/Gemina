 This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of nodal metastases and to disclose the diagnostic performance of endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS) and PET/CT in T and N staging in surgically resected early-stage esophageal squamous cell carcinomas ( eSCCs). Institutional review board approved this retrospective study with waiver of informed consent for reviewing medical record. We included 435 patients with an early T-stage ( Tis or T1a ( ≤ T1a) , T1b and T2) eSCC. The rates of metastatic lymphadenopathy<disease><symptom> were calculated. Then , the performance of EUS and PET/CT in subdividing T and N stages was assessed. 131 ≤ T1a , 234 T1b , and 70 T2 eSCCs were identified. In discriminating ≤ T1a from other cancers , the sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy of EUS were 60.3 % ( 79/131) , 80.3 % ( 244/304) , and 74.3 % ( 323/435) respectively. With ROC curve analysis , cut-off value of SUVmax 3.05 at PET provided sensitivity 74.8 % ( 98/131) , specificity 70.1 % ( 213/304) , and accuracy 71.5 % ( 311/435) for differentiating ≤ T1a eSCCs from others. Ten ( 7.6 %) of 131 ≤ T1a cancers had nodal metastasis. In discriminating N0 from node-positive disease , sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy of EUS were 89.6 % ( 267/298) , 41.6 % ( 57/137) , and 74.5 % ( 324/435) , respectively , whereas those of PET/CT were 88.9 % ( 265/298) , 38.7 % ( 53/137) , and 73.1 % ( 318/435) respectively. In > 70 % of patients with ≤ T1a eSCCs , the tumor stage can be discriminated from higher stage cancers by using EUS or PET/CT. Substantial percentage ( 7.6 %) of ≤ T1a eSCC patients have nodal metastases , which are missed in more than half of the patients in clinical staging.
