 The age of the population worldwide is rapidly increasing , bringing social and economic challenges. Persuasive technology can alleviate the burden on traditional healthcare services when used to support healthy behaviors , for instance in the prevention and treatment of chronic<disease> diseases<disease>. Additionally , healthy behaviors are key factors for active and healthy ageing by delaying or even reversing functional decline. In this manuscript , we present a multi-perspective analysis of technologies that can be used in the support of active and healthy ageing in the daily life. First , we take the perspective of physical and mental health , by focusing on the promotion of physical activity and emotional wellbeing. From a temporal perspective , we look at how technology evolved from past , present and future. The overview of the literature is structured in four main sections: ( 1) measurement of current behavior ( monitoring) , ( 2) analysis of the data gathered to derive meaningful information ( analyzing & reasoning) , ( 3) support the individual in the adoption or maintenance of a behavior ( coaching) , and ( 4) tools or interfaces that provide the information to the individual to stimulate the desired behavior ( applications). Finally , we provide recommendations for the design , development and implementation of future technological innovations to support Active and Healthy Ageing in daily life.
