 The primary objective of this study was to investigate whether noninvasive ventilation ( NIV) can positively affect exercise capacity , maximum oxygen uptake ( 47 subjects with COPD who were enrolled in a physical training program were randomized to either physical training alone or NIV + physical training ( NIV-Physical training). Physical training consisted of dynamic aerobic exercises on a treadmill 3 times/week for 6 weeks , for a total of 18 sessions. NIV was titrated according to the subject 's tolerance at rest and during exercise. Assessments included physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> and symptoms at the incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test peak and during submaximal exercise on a treadmill , 6-min walk distance , maximum inspiratory ( P 43 subjects completed the 6-week physical training program. Both groups improved 6-min walk distance , P A 6-week physical training program alone can improve tolerance for exercise and quality of life , in addition to reducing the risk of mortality. However , NIV associated with a physical training program was shown to have an additive beneficial effect on powerful prognostic markers ( maximum VÌ‡
