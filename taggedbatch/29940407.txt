 MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation by dendritic cells is necessary for activation of na√Øve CD4 T cells , whereas class II-restricted antigen presentation by B lymphocytes and macrophages is important for the recruitment of CD4 + helper and regulatory T cells. Antigen presentation by B cells is also important for induction of T cell tolerance. B cells are unique among these three types of MHC class II-expressing antigen presenting cells ( APC) as they constitutively express high levels of cell surface class II molecules and express a clonally restricted antigen specific receptor , the B cell receptor ( BCR). Here , I review our current understanding of three major steps that underlie the processing and presentation of BCR-bound cognate antigen: ( 1) endocytosis of antigen-BCR ( Ag-BCR) complexes , ( 2) Ag-BCR trafficking to intracellular antigen processing compartments and ( 3) generation of antigenic peptide-MHC class II complexes , with a particular focus on the role of BCR ubiquitination in each. I will highlight potential topics for future research and briefly discuss the impact of the cell biology of BCR-mediated antigen processing on the response of the B cell and T cell to the cell-cell interactions mediated by B cell-expressed peptide-class II complexes.
