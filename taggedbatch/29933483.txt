 The outcomes of so called `` salvage '' resections after definitive chemoradiation vs. curative resections after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy ( IT-resection) in patients with stage IIIA/B locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer have rarely been compared. The aim of our study was to compare perioperative results , postoperative and recurrence-free survival and to identify relevant prognostic survival factors for both therapy strategies. Between June 2008 and May 2017 , 43 patients underwent pulmonary resection following induction therapy ( group 1) and 14 patients underwent salvage resection after definitive chemoradiation ( group 2). Retrospective analysis was performed of demographic factors , tumour stage and location , initial therapy , preoperative regression status , perioperative morbidity and mortality , postoperative and recurrence-free survival. In group 2 , significantly higher radiation dose was applied ( p < 0.001) and the interval between chemoradiation and lung resection was significantly longer ( p = 0.02). In addition , significantly higher perioperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> and more frequent blood transfusions were noted ( p = 0.003 and 0.005 , respectively). Perioperative morbidity and mortality were statistically comparable in the two groups ( p = 0.72 and 0.395 , respectively). Postoperative 5 year survival in group 1 was 55 % , in group 2 48 % ( log-rank p = 0.353). Five year recurrence-free survival in group 1 was 53 % , in group 2 42 % ( log-rank p = 0.180). Diffuse metastasis occurred mostly in group 2 , whereas in group 1 oligometastasis was more frequently noted. Postoperative outcome after salvage resection seems statistically comparable to results following curative resection after induction therapy. Diffuse distant metastasis is frequently noted. Careful patient selection is required.
