 Surgical guidance and decision making could be improved with accurate and real-time measurement of intra-operative data including shape and spectral information of the tissue surface. In this work , a dual-modality endoscopic system has been proposed to enable tissue surface shape reconstruction and hyperspectral imaging ( HSI). This system centers around a probe comprised of an incoherent fiber bundle , whose fiber arrangement is different at the two ends , and miniature imaging optics. For 3D reconstruction with structured light ( SL) , a light pattern formed of randomly distributed spots with different colors is projected onto the tissue surface , creating artificial texture. Pattern decoding with a Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN) model and a customized feature descriptor enables real-time 3D surface reconstruction at approximately 12 frames per second ( FPS). In HSI mode , spatially sparse hyperspectral signals from the tissue surface can be captured with a slit hyperspectral imager in a single snapshot. A CNN based super-resolution model , namely `` super-spectral-resolution '' network ( SSRNet) , has also been developed to estimate pixel-level dense hypercubes from the endoscope cameras standard RGB images and the sparse hyperspectral signals , at approximately 2 FPS. The probe , with a 2.1 mm diameter , enables the system to be used with endoscope working channels. Furthermore , since data acquisition in both modes can be accomplished in one snapshot , operation of this system in clinical applications is minimally affected by tissue surface movement and deformation. The whole apparatus has been validated on phantoms and tissue ( ex vivo and in vivo) , while initial measurements on patients during laryngeal surgery show its potential in real-world clinical applications.
