 BACKGROUND Scedosporium/Lomentospora species are opportunistic mould pathogens , presenting notable antifungal resistance. OBJECTIVES/METHODS We analysed the conidia and germinated conidia of S.<pathogen> apiospermum<pathogen> ( Sap) , S. aurantiacum<pathogen> ( Sau) , S. minutisporum ( Smi) and L.<pathogen> prolificans<pathogen> ( Lpr) by scanning electron microscopy and exposition of surface molecules by fluorescence microscopy. FINDINGS Conidia of Sap , Smi and Sau had oval , ellipsoidal and cylindrical shape , respectively , with several irregularities surrounding all surface areas , whereas Lpr conidia were rounded with a smooth surface. The germination of Sap occurred at the conidial bottom , while Smi and Sau germination primarily occurred at the centre of the conidial cell , and Lpr germination initiated at any part of the conidial surface. The staining of N-acetylglucosamine-containing molecules by fluorescein-labelled WGA primarily occurred during the germination of all studied fungi<pathogen> and in the conidial scars , which is the primary location of germination. Calcofluor white , which recognises the polysaccharide chitin , strongly stained the conidial cells and , to a lesser extent , the germination. Both mannose-rich glycoconjugates ( evidenced by fluoresceinated-ConA) and cell wall externally located polypeptides presented distinct surface locations and expression according to both morphotypes and fungal species. In contrast , sialic acid and galactose-containing structures were not detected at fungal surfaces. MAIN CONCLUSIONS The present study demonstrated the differential production/exposition of surface molecules on distinct morphotypes of Scedosporium/Lomentospora species.
