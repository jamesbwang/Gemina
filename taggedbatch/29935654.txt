 Personalized medicine has many definitions. This term is often used synonymously with precision medicine , which is defined as the classifying patients with a disease or condition based on their phenotypic findings , such as biomarkers or genomics , into subpopulations that differ in their response to a specific treatment. Personalized medicine , however , can also mean the treatment of individual patients based on many contextual factors , such as response to therapy and patient preferences , in addition to predefined phenotypic findings. Regulatory approval for the marketing of a new drug or a new indication for a marketed drug requires a positive benefit risk profile and substantial evidence of effectiveness. The indication is based on the eligibility criteria and outcomes of the clinical trial ( s) underpinning the regulatory approval. For precision medicine , drugs are often developed with companion diagnostics that are necessary for selection of the subgroup of patients , in contrast to personalized medicine which may be directed at a single patient. Most drugs are approved with a fixed dosage regimen for the approved population , but some drugs and biologics are approved with instructions to tailor therapy for individual patients , whether it be dosing , combination with other therapies , or selection among a class of medications. Hence , more often than not , personalized medicine directed at individual patients is achieved through the practice of medicine rather than regulatory action.
