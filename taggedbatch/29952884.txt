 Retrospective cohort study , Level of Evidence III OBJECTIVE.: To determine the relationship between internal organ orientation and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS) convexity directionality SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: AIS affects 2-3 % of the general population and demonstrations 80-99 % right thoracic curve convexity. The mechanism of AIS as well as explanation for right-sided predominance is largely unknown. A retrospective chart review of all patients with dextrocardia from 2008-2018 was performed at a single institution. Upright chest x-rays and scoliosis x-rays were evaluated for scoliosis by measurement of Cobb angle. Chart review was performed to extract age , advanced imaging results , and surgical intervention. Of 110 patients identified with dextrocardia , 19 patients exhibited radiographic features consistent with AIS ( Cobb angle > 10 degrees). Fifteen ( 79 %) of these patients demonstrated left-sided thoracic curvature. Six patients showed isolated dextrocardia with normal abdominal organ orientation; five patients ( 83 %) showed left-sided thoracic curvature. There was not a statistical difference with regards to gender or curve severity. MRI was performed on five patients with left-sided curvature without evidence of intra-spinal pathology. Dextrocardia shows increased incidence of AIS in both male and female patients. Left-sided thoracic curvature in cases with concurrent dextrocardia may not be associated with intra-spinal pathology as seen in the general population. This data suggests that thoracic organ orientation affects AIS convexity directionality. 4.
