 Obesity levels , especially in children , have dramatically increased over the last few decades. Recently , several studies highlighted the involvement of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of obesity. We investigated the composition of gut microbiota in obese adolescents and adults compared to age-matched normal weight ( NW) volunteers in order to assemble age- and obesity-related microbiota profiles. The composition of gut microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA-based metagenomics. Ecological representations of microbial communities were computed , and univariate , multivariate , and correlation analyses performed on bacterial profiles. The prediction of metagenome functional content from 16S rRNA gene surveys was carried out. Ecological analyses revealed a dissimilarity among the subgroups , and resultant microbiota profiles differed between obese adolescents and adults. Using statistical analyses , we assigned , as microbial markers ,
