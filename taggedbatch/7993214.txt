 The advent of optical coherence tomography ( OCT) imaging has changed the way ophthalmologists image the ocular surface and anterior segment of the eye. Its ability to obtain dynamic , high and ultra-high resolution , cross-sectional images of the ocular surface and anterior segment in a noninvasive and rapid manner allows for ease of use. In this review , we focus on the use of anterior segment OCT , which provides an `` optical biopsy '' or in vivo imaging of various ocular surface and corneal pathologies , allowing the clinician to diagnose diseases otherwise not visualized by traditional methods. The utility of anterior segment OCT for various anterior segment pathologies is reviewed.
