 Rho-associated kinase ( ROCK) is an emerging target in acute ischemic stroke. Early pre-hospital treatment with ROCK inhibitors may improve their efficacy , but their antithrombotic effects raise safety concerns in hemorrhagic stroke , precluding use prior to neuroimaging. Therefore , we tested whether ROCK inhibition affects the bleeding times , and worsens hematoma volume in a model of intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH) induced by intrastriatal collagenase injection in mice. Tail bleeding time was measured 1 h after treatment with isoform-nonselective inhibitor fasudil , or ROCK2-selective inhibitor KD025 , or their vehicles. In the ICH model , treatments were administered 1 h after collagenase injection. Although KD025 but not fasudil prolonged the tail bleeding times , neither drug expanded the volume of ICH or worsened neurological deficits at 48 h compared with vehicle. Although more testing is needed in aged animals and comorbid models such as diabetes , these results suggest ROCK inhibitors may be safe for pre-hospital administration in acute stroke.
