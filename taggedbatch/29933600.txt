 The role of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) in the metabolic reprogramming of cells adapted to hypoxia and the interplay between ROS and hypoxia in malignancy is under debate. Here , we examined how ROS levels are modulated by hypoxia in human cancer compared to untransformed cells. Short time exposure ( 20 min) of either fibroblasts or 143B osteosarcoma cells to low oxygen tension down to 0.5 % induced a significant decrease of the cellular ROS level , as detected by the CellROX fluorescent probe ( & minus; 70 %). Prolonging the cells & rsquo; exposure to hypoxia for 24 h , ROS decreased further , reaching nearly 20 % of the normoxic value. In this regard , due to the debated role of the endogenous inhibitor protein ( IF ₁) of the ATP synthase complex in cancer cell bioenergetics , we investigated whether IF ₁ is involved in the control of ROS generation under severe hypoxic conditions. A significant ROS content decrease was observed in hypoxia in both IF ₁- expressing and IF ₁- silenced cells compared to normoxia. However , IF ₁- silenced cells showed higher ROS levels compared to IF1-containing cells. In addition , the MitoSOX Red-measured superoxide level of all the hypoxic cells was significantly lower compared to normoxia; however , the decrease was milder than the marked drop of ROS content. Accordingly , the difference between IF ₁- expressing and IF ₁- silenced cells was smaller but significant in both normoxia and hypoxia. In conclusion , the interplay between ROS and hypoxia and its modulation by IF ₁ have to be taken into account to develop therapeutic strategies against cancer.
