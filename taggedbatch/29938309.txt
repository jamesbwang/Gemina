 The aim of this study was to explore the predictive implications of the composition of immune cell populations prior to lenalidomide plus high-dose dexamethasone ( Len-Dex) initiation for the occurrence of infections. We prospectively examined immune cell populations in peripheral blood taken at baseline of lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone ( Len-dex) therapy and reviewed clinical and microbiology records in 90 patients with refractory/relapsed multiple myeloma ( RRMM). Risk factors for infection were analyzed using logistic regression. During a median of 11 cycles of Len-dex treatment , 52 ( 57.8 %) patients experienced at least 1 infection episode. Of a total of 92 episodes of infection , 58 ( 63 %) episodes were clinically defined , 29 ( 31.5 %) episodes were microbiologically defined , and 5 ( 5.4 %) episodes were fever<symptom> of unknown origin. Severe episodes were more frequently observed during the first 3 cycles. After adjusting for risk factors for infection based on univariate analyses , multivariate analyses showed that lower Hb ( < 10 g/dL) was a clinically independent factor associated with occurrence of infections. Lower frequency ( P = 0.044) and absolute count ( P = 0.014) of circulating CD3
