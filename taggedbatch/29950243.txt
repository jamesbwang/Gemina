 Hematopoietic stem cells ( HSC) are a class of stem cells with self-renewal and multipotent differentiation into a variety of blood cells and are most thoroughly studied , maturely applied in the clinic adult stem cell. Function of HSC is closely associated with metabolic regulation. The metabolic state mainly maintains HSC living in hypoxic bone<disease> marrow microenvironment depending on glycolysis for energy metabolism , and keeping low reactive oxygen species ( ROS) level. Proteins like Hif-1 , FoxO3 , ATM , PTPMT1 protect HSC from ROS injury , maintaining HSC in hypoxic state. In addition , glucose metabolism-related enzymes , glutamine , fatty acid oxidation , purine and amino acid metabolism also play important roles in metabolic regulation of HSC. In this review the research progress on metabolism regnlation mechanisms of HSC is summurized , focusing on the mechanisms releted with oxydation metabolism regulation , carbohydrate metabolism level , purine metabolism and aminoacide metabolism.
