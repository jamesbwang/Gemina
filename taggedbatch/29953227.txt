 We investigated the constituents of Leucaena leucocephala foliage collected from Guangdong province in China and isolated 17 diverse flavonoids ( 1-17) , including flavones ( 5-9 , 11 , and 12) , flavonols ( 1 , 10 , and 16) , flavanone 4 , flavanonol 15 , and flavonol glycosides ( 2 , 3 , 13 , 14 , and 17). Flavonoids quercetin ( 1) , quercetin-3- O-α-rhamnopyranoside ( 2) , and myricetin-3- O-α-rhamnopyranoside ( 17) were the major flavonoids components in L. leucocephala leaves , at a total concentration of about 2.5 % of dry matter. pHRE-Luc inductive activity to mimic the activation of erythropoietin ( EPO) gene , anti-inflammatory , antidiabetic , and antioxidant activities of isolated flavonoids ( 1-17) were evaluated. Flavonoids 7 , 10 , and 13 could strongly induce the transcriptional activity of pHRE-Luc , which indicated their potential to induce the expression of EPO. Flavonoids 7 , 10 , 13 , and 17 displayed strong anti-inflammatory activity , relatively equal to the positive control dexamethasone. Flavonoids 1 , 2 , 3 , 11 , 12 , 16 , and 17 showed stronger antioxidant activities of DPPH radical scavenging capacity than ascorbic acid. Flavonoids 1 , 2 , and 10 showed weak cellular antioxidant activities against tert-butyl hydroperoxide ( tBHP) induced ROS formation. Flavonoid rhamnoside 2 and arabinoside 3 undergone deglycosylation to the aglycone quercetin under anaerobic incubation with cattle rumen microorganisms. Furthermore , the potential health benefits for ruminant of flavonoids , which was rich in L. leucocephala foliage , was also discussed.
