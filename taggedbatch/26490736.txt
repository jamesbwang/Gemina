 The aim of this study is to find the potential survival related DNA methylation signature capable of predicting survival time for acute myelocytic leukemia<disease> ( AML) patients. DNA methylation data were downloaded. DNA methylation signature was identified in the training group , and subsequently validated in an independent validation group. The overall survival of DNA methylation signature was performed. Functional analysis was used to explore the function of corresponding genes of DNA methylation signature. Differentially methylated sites and CpG islands were also identified in poor-risk group. A DNA methylation signature involving 8 DNA methylation sites and 6 genes were identified. Functional analysis showed that protein binding and cytoplasm were the only two enriched Gene Ontology terms. A total of 70 differentially methylated sites and 6 differentially methylated CpG islands were identified in poor-risk group. The identified survival related DNA methylation signature adds to the prognostic value of AML.
