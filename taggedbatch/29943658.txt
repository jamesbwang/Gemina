 Eukaryotic cells have 2 to 3 discrete nucleoli required for ribosome synthesis. Nucleoli are phase separated nuclear sub-organelles. Here we examined the role of nuclear Lamins and nucleolar factors in modulating the compartmentalization and dynamics of histone 2B ( H2B-ECFP) in the nucleolus. Live imaging and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching ( FRAP) of labelled H2B , showed that the depletion of Lamin B1 , Fibrillarin ( FBL) or Nucleostemin ( GNL3) , enhances H2B-ECFP mobility in the nucleolus. Furthermore , Nucleolin knockdown significantly decreases H2B-ECFP compartmentalization in the nucleolus , while H2B-ECFP residence and mobility in the nucleolus was prolonged upon Nucleolin overexpression. Co-expression of N-terminal and RNA binding domain ( RBD) deletion mutants of Nucleolin or inhibiting 45S rRNA synthesis reduces the sequestration of H2B-ECFP in the nucleolus. Taken together , these studies reveal a crucial role of Nucleolin-rRNA complex in modulating the compartmentalization , stability and dynamics of H2B within the nucleolus.
