 Cationic polylysine promotes , under neutral conditions , the spontaneous aggregation of opposite charged ZnTPPS in water. Spectroscopic investigations evidence a different preorganization of ZnTPPS onto the polypeptide matrix depending on the chain length. Spinodal decomposition theory in confined geometry is used to model this mechanism by considering the time evolution of a homogeneous distribution of randomly adsorbed particles ( porphyrins) onto a rodlike polyelectrolyte ( polymer) of variable length L.
