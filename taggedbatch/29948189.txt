 Advantageous effects of cognitive control are well-known , but cognitive control may also have adverse effects , for example when it suppresses the implicit processing of stimulus-response ( S-R) bindings that could benefit task performance. Yet , the neurophysiological and functional neuroanatomical structures associated with adverse effects of cognitive control are poorly understood. We used an extreme group approach to compare individuals who exhibit adverse effects of cognitive control to individuals who do not by combining event-related potentials ( ERPs) , source localization , time-frequency analysis and network analysis methods. While neurophysiological correlates of cognitive control ( i.e. N2 , N450 , theta power and theta-mediated neuronal network efficiency) and task-set updating ( P3) both reflect control demands and implicit information processing , differences in the degree of adverse cognitive control effects are associated with two independent neural mechanisms: Individuals , who show adverse behavioral effects of cognitive control , show reduced small-world properties and thus reduced efficiency in theta-modulated networks when they fail to effectively process implicit information. In contrast to this , individuals who do not display adverse control effects show enhanced task-set updating mechanism when effectively processing implicit information , which is reflected by the P3 ERP component and associated with the temporo-parietal junction ( TPJ , BA 40) and medial frontal gyrus ( MFG; BA 8). These findings suggest that implicit S-R contingencies , which benefit response selection without cognitive control , are always ` picked up ' , but may fail to be integrated with task representations to guide response selection. This provides evidence for a neurophysiological and functional neuroanatomical `` dual-process '' account of adverse cognitive control effects.
