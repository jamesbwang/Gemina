 Strains of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( STEC) can cause the severe Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome<disease><symptom> ( HUS). Shiga toxins are protein toxins that bind and kill microvascular cells , damaging vital organs. No specific therapeutics or vaccines have been licensed for use in humans yet. The most common route of infection is by consumption of dairy or farm products contaminated with STEC. Domestic cattle colonized by STEC strains represent the main reservoir , and thus a source of contamination. Outer Membrane Vesicles ( OMV) obtained after detergent treatment of gram-negative bacteria have been used over the past decades for producing many licensed vaccines. These nanoparticles are not only multi-antigenic in nature but also potent immunopotentiators and immunomodulators. Formulations based on chemical-inactivated OMV ( OMVi) obtained from a virulent STEC strain ( O157: H7 serotype) were found to protect against pathogenicity in a murine model and to be immunogenic in calves. These initial studies suggest that STEC-derived OMV has a potential for the formulation of both human and veterinary vaccines.
