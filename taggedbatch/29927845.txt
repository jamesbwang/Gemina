: Our objective was to study the preventive effect of lowering blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) by medication and/or lifestyle changes on incident all-cause dementia , Alzheimer 's disease and vascular dementia. In this systematic review , we included randomized controlled trials with a BP-lowering intervention. Of the nine included trials , seven assessed the effect of antihypertensive medication and two of a lifestyle or combined intervention. In the intervention arm , 1041 out of 29 029 ( 3.6 %) participants were diagnosed with dementia compared with 1090 out of 28 653 ( 3.8 %) controls during a median follow-up of 3.9 years ( range 2-10) , resulting in a pooled risk ratio of 0.93 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.84-1.02; I 16 %). Three trials specified dementia subtypes , with no significant effect on Alzheimer 's disease or vascular dementia. To conclude , lowering BP by medication and/or lifestyle changes did not lead to a significantly reduced risk of dementia. This appeared independent of dementia subtype.
