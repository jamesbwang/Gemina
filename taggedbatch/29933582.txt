 The physical and chemical properties of V-M & Prime; and Nb-M & Prime; ( M&P rime; is 3d or 4d transition metal) co-doped BaTiO ₃ were studied by first-principles calculation based on density functional theory. Our calculation results show that V-M & Prime; co-doping is more favorable than Nb-M & Prime; co-doping in terms of narrowing the bandgap and increasing the visible-light absorption. In pure BaTiO ₃ , the bandgap depends on the energy levels of the Ti 3d and O 2p states. The appropriate co-doping can effectively manipulate the bandgap by introducing new energy levels interacting with those of the pure BaTiO ₃. The optimal co-doping effect comes from the V-Cr co-doping system , which not only has smaller impurity formation energy , but also significantly reduces the bandgap. Detailed analysis of the density of states , band structure , and charge-density distribution in the doping systems demonstrates the synergistic effect induced by the V and Cr co-doping. The results can provide not only useful insights into the understanding of the bandgap engineering by element doping , but also beneficial guidance to the experimental study of BaTiO ₃ for visible-light photoelectrical applications.
