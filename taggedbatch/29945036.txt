 In obesity and dyslipidemia , hydrolysis of triacylglycerol ( TAG) into non-esterified fatty acids ( NEFAs) may contribute to insulin resistance , and production of oxygenated , bioactive polyunsaturated fatty acids may increase oxidative stress. Here we show that after six weeks of high-fat feeding of obese prone rats ( Crl: OP ( CD) , vitamin C was increased both in liver ( P < 0.01) and plasma ( P < 0.001) , while both TAG ( P < 0.01) and NEFA ( P < 0.001) were lower than in low-fat fed control rats. Hepatic vitamin C biosynthesis was similar between groups , indicating that a new steady state level was established with a higher vitamin C level adequate for supplying the systemic needs. Glucose and insulin sensitivity were unaffected at this stage. Eventually , the mobilization of vitamin C may be seen as a mechanism to protect the host against insulin resistance.
