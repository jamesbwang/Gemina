 Anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK) gene can be oncogenic either by forming fusion with other genes , amplification of the gene or by having mutations. ALK rearrangement can either be detected by standard `` fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) '' or `` immunohistochemistry ( IHC) ''. Objective of this study was to record the prevalence of ALK rearrangement in adenocarcinoma of Primary Lung origin and compare it with ALK-IHC staining. Data of 64 patients of lung adenocarcinoma from 2015-2017 was analyzed. All of the FFPE biopsies were tested for EGFR ( qPCR) followed by ALK rearrangement ( by FISH and IHC) on EGFR negative samples. Out of 64 samples , 21.8 % ( 14) showed EGFR mutations and 14 % ( 7/50) were positive for ALK rearrangement when checked by FISH. In IHC testing for ALK ( FISH positive) 8 % ( 4/50) showed positivity. In conclusion ALK-FISH positive cases are higher than other studies likely due to the relatively small sample size. FISH testing was found to be more sensitive than IHC; one reason may be the low level of ALK. Our study warrants that currently FISH remains the gold standard for screening of ALK gene rearrangements.
