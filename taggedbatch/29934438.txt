 None Intestinal radioprotection was modelled in vitro with cell lines and enteroids as well as in vivo by assaying clinical outcomes and crypt survival. Fractionated abdominal and single dose radiation were used along with syngeneic CT26 colon tumour grafts to assess tumour radioprotection. LGG with a mutation in the processing of lipoteichoic acid ( LTA) , a TLR2 agonist , was not radioprotective , while LTA agonist and native LGG were. An agonist of CXCR4 blocked LGG-induced MSC migration and LGG-induced radioprotection. LGG given by gavage induced expression of CXCL12 , a CXCR4 agonist , in pericryptal macrophages and depletion of macrophages by clodronate liposomes blocked LGG-induced MSC migration and radioprotection. LTA effectively protected the normal intestinal crypt , but not tumours in fractionated radiation regimens. LGG acts as a ` time-release capsule ' releasing radioprotective LTA. LTA then primes the epithelial stem cell niche to protect epithelial stem cells by triggering a multicellular , adaptive immune signalling cascade involving macrophages and PGE2 secreting MSCs.
