 Lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM) is a rare systemic<disease> disease<disease> that occurs almost exclusively in women. In the last few years , our understanding of disease pathobiology has improved substantially; in addition , a guideline document has recently been developed that provides recommendations for the diagnosis and clinical management of patients with LAM. Yet , significant gaps in knowledge remain. Groundbreaking insights into the cellular biochemistry of LAM have led to the reclassification of the disease as a low-grade , destructive , metastasizing neoplasm. In addition , recent data confirm the potential of next-generation sequencing to detect low-prevalence mutations in tuberous sclerosis ( TSC) genes in sporadic LAM. A randomized , double-blind , multicentre trial has confirmed the efficacy of sirolimus in stabilizing lung function , improving functional performance and quality of life , and reducing lymphatic manifestations in patients with LAM. Accordingly , recent guidelines issued by the American Thoracic Society and the Japanese Respiratory Society recommend sirolimus treatment for patients with LAM and reduced lung function. Uncertainty remains , however , with regard to patient selection , and timing of initiation , duration and dosing of treatment. Significant advances have been made in the diagnosis and clinical management of patients with LAM. However , additional studies are needed to assess long-term safety and efficacy of sirolimus therapy , and to identify predictors of disease behaviour and response to treatment.
