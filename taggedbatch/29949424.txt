 This study compares characteristics and outcomes of 70 defendants with and 1,122 without intellectual and developmental disabilities ( IDD) participating in a mental health court. Demographic and clinical characteristics differed , but criminal justice or program characteristics did not. Age , race , marital status , living situation , court location , health insurance status , and likelihood of mental illness or substance abuse diagnosis differed between the two groups. When controlling for other factors , a diagnosis of IDD did not affect the odds of negative termination from the court but did reduce the odds of rearrest within 1 year of leaving the court. Some mental health courts exclude people with IDD; the study concludes inclusion is appropriate.
