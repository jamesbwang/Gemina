 The purpose of this work was to evaluate the intestinal permeability , oral absorption and disposition of the ester prodrug valacyclovir in wildtype mice and a huPepT1 transgenic mouse model. PepT1 ( SLC15A1) is a transporter apically expressed along the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract and is responsible for the absorption of di-/ tripeptides , ACE inhibitors , Î²-lactam antibiotics and numerous prodrugs. Unfortunately , PepT1-mediated substrates that have been extensively studied were shown to exhibit species-dependent absorption and pharmacokinetics. Accordingly , in situ intestinal perfusion studies were conducted and valacyclovir uptake was shown to have a 30-fold lower K
