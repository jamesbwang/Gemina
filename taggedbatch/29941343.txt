 The administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC) preceding radical cystectomy benefits overall survival for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer ( MIBC). However , the relationship between the genetic profiling of MIBC and NAC response remains unclear. Here , a mutation panel of six cancer-associated genes ( TSC1 , FGFR3 , TERT , TP53 , PIK3CA and ERBB2) and an immunohistochemistry ( IHC) panel containing eight bladder cancer ( BC) biomarkers ( EGFR , RRM1 , PD-L1 , BRCA1 , TUBB3 , ERCC , ERCC1 , aberrantly glycosylated integrin α3β1 ( AG) and CK5/6) were developed. BC samples from patients who showed a pathologic response ( n = 39) and non-response ( n = 13) were applied to the panel analysis. ERBB2 , FGFR3 and PIK3CA exclusively altered in the responders group ( 19/39 , 48.7 %) , in which FGFR3 mutations were significantly enriched in patients with a response in the cohort ( 14/39 , 35.9 %; P = 0.01). Additionally , strong expression of ERCC1 was associated with a pathologic response ( P = 0.01). However , positive lymph node metastasis ( P < 0.01) and lymph-vascular invasion ( LVI) ( P = 0.03) were correlated with a non-response. Overall , the data show that FGFR3 mutations and elevated expression of ERCC1 in MIBCs are potential predictive biomarkers of the response to NAC.
