 Although detecting and characterizing community structure is key in the study of networked systems , we still do not understand how community structure affects systemic resilience and stability. We use percolation theory to develop a framework for studying the resilience of networks with a community structure. We find both analytically and numerically that interlinks ( the connections among communities) affect the percolation phase transition in a way similar to an external field in a ferromagnetic- paramagnetic spin system. We also study universality class by defining the analogous critical exponents
