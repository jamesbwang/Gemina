 Nanoscale zerovalent iron ( nZVI) likely finds its application in source zone remediation. Two approaches to modify nZVI have been reported: bimetal ( Fe-Me) and sulfidated nZVI ( S-nZVI). However , previous research has primarily focused on enhancing particle reactivity with these two modifications under more plume-like conditions. In this study , we systematically compared the trichloroethene ( TCE) dechlorination pathway , rate , and electron selectivity of Fe-Me ( Me: Pd , Ni , Cu , and Ag) , S-nZVI , and nZVI with excess TCE simulating source zone conditions. TCE dechlorination on Fe-Me was primarily via hydrogenolysis while that on S-nZVI and nZVI was mainly via Î²-elimination. The surface-area normalized TCE reduction rate ( k
