 Coconut water has been commonly consumed as a beverage for its multiple health benefits while vinegar has been used as common seasoning and a traditional Chinese medicine. The present study investigates the potential of coconut water vinegar in promoting recovery on acetaminophen induced liver damage. Mice were injected with 250 mg/kg body<symptom> weight acetaminophen for 7 days and were treated with distilled water ( untreated) , Silybin ( positive control) and coconut water vinegar ( 0.08 mL/kg and 2 mL/kg body<symptom> weight). Level of oxidation stress and inflammation<symptom> among treated and untreated mice were compared. Untreated mice oral administrated with acetaminophen were observed with elevation of serum liver profiles , liver histological changes , high level of cytochrome P450 2E1 , reduced level of liver antioxidant and increased level of inflammatory related markers indicating liver damage. On the other hand , acetaminophen challenged mice treated with 14 days of coconut water vinegar were recorded with reduction of serum liver profiles , improved liver histology , restored liver antioxidant , reduction of liver inflammation<symptom> and decreased level of liver cytochrome P450 2E1 in dosage dependent level. Coconut water vinegar has helped to attenuate acetaminophen-induced liver damage by restoring antioxidant activity and suppression of inflammation<symptom>.
