 Psoriasis is a chronic and prevalent disease , and the associated pruritus is a common , difficult-to-control symptom. The mediators involved in psoriatic pruritus have not been fully established. To evaluate associations between the number of mast cells in psoriatic lesions<symptom> and the intensity of pruritus. 29 patients with plaque psoriasis were recruited. In all participants , Psoriasis Area and Severity Index and Body Surface Area were assessed. A questionnaire was administered to obtain clinical information and the Dermatology Life Quality Index. Pruritus was assessed using a visual analog scale and skin biopsies were performed for staining with Giemsa and Immunohistochemistry with C-Kit. Pruritus was observed in 91.3 % of our patients. Median VAS was 6 ( p25-75: 2-8). The immunohistochemical method revealed a mean of 11.32 mast cells/field and Giemsa staining revealed a mean of 6.72 mast cells/field. There was no correlation between the intensity of pruritus and mast cell count , neither in Immunohistochemistry ( p = 0.15; rho = -0.27) nor in Giemsa ( p = 0.16; rho = -0.27). Pruritus did not impact on the Dermatology Life Quality Index ( p = 0.51; rho = -0.13). The small sample size may be considered the main limitation of our study. Although mast cells are mediators of pruritus in many cutaneous<disease> diseases<disease> , our findings support that psoriatic pruritus is a complex disorder with multifactorial , complex pathophysiology , involving pruritogenic mediators others than mast cells.
