 Positioning patients for orthopedic procedures can be a daunting experience for nurses because of the wide variety of orthopedic procedures and available positioners. Understanding what to use for a particular procedure can help perioperative nurses feel more confident and allow them to provide the safest patient care possible. This knowledge also helps avoid workflow delays because of missing or incorrect equipment. Educators or senior staff nurses can provide access to information and education that will help ensure that nurses provide efficient , safe care for patients undergoing orthopedic procedures. Training should begin in the employee orientation phase and be provided when new additions or modifications to positioning policies occur. The educator should validate staff member competency on a regular basis to help ensure the correct equipment is used and to disseminate knowledge regarding any changes or upgrades to positioners.
