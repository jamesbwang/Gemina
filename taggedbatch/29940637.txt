 The current limits of the endodontic disinfection strategies are not only a result of bacterial biofilm growth mode inside the root canals , they are equally due to the anatomical complexity of the root canal system , of its structure , of the dentin composition and of the factors associated with chemical disinfectants. One of the major problems is the fact that a great part of the endodontic anatomy remains uninstrumented after conventional treatment and even the accessible parts of the root canals are covered in smear layer , which results as a by-product of the instrumentation and acts as a barrier for irrigants , medication and even influencing the quality of the endodontic filling. Therefore , strategies in advanced disinfection in endodontics are developed and tested in order to meet these challenges. The present study aims to assess the possibility of improving the debridement of the root canals by using erbium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet ( Er: YAG) laser radiation. We used extracted teeth , which were subjected to the conventional treatment protocol and then divided into three study groups: the negative control group and two other groups , which were exposed to laser radiation using two energy levels. Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) revealed the efficiency of the laser aided treatment versus the conventional methods of cleaning and disinfection of root canals.
