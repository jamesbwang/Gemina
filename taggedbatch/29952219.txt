 Idiopathic pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( IPF) is a devastating interstitial lung disease with increasing mortality and poor prognosis. The current understanding of the role of long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) in IPF remain limited. In the present study , we identified a lncRNA NONMMUT022554 , designated pulmonary fibrosis-regulatory lncRNA ( PFRL) , with unknown functions and found that its levels were increased in fibrotic lung tissues of mice and pulmonary fibroblasts exposed to TGF-β1. Furthermore , we found that enforced expression of PFRL induced fibroblast activation and collagen deposition , which could be mitigated by the overexpression of miR-26a. By contrast , the inhibition of PFRL could markedly alleviate the TGF-β1-induced up-regulation of fibrotic markers and attenuate fibroblast proliferation and differentiation by regulating miR-26a. Meanwhile , our study confirmed that PFRL inhibited the expression and activity of miR-26a , which has been identified as an anti-fibrotic miRNA in our previous study. Interestingly , our molecular study further confirmed that Smad2 transcriptionally inhibits the expression of miR-26a and that the miR-26a/ Smad2 feedback loop mediates the pro-fibrotic effects of PFRL in lung<disease> fibrosis<disease>. More importantly , knockdown of PFRL ablated BLM-induced pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> in vivo. Taken together , our findings indicate that lncRNA PFRL contributes to the progression of lung<disease> fibrosis<disease> by modulating the reciprocal repression between miR-26a and Smad2 and that this lncRNA may be a therapeutic target for IPF.
