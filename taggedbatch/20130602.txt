 The unique biology of the oocyte means that accepted paradigms for DNA repair and protection are not of direct relevance to the female gamete. Instead , preservation of the integrity of the maternal genome depends on endogenous protein stores and/or mRNA transcripts accumulated during oogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine whether mature ( MII) oocytes have the capacity to detect DNA damage and subsequently mount effective repair. For this purpose , DNA double strand breaks ( DSB) were elicited using the topoisomerase II inhibitor , etoposide ( ETP). ETP challenge led to a rapid and significant increase in DSB ( P = 0.0002) and the consequential incidence of metaphase plate abnormalities ( P = 0.0031). Despite this , ETP-treated MII oocytes retained their ability to participate in in vitro fertilisation , though displayed reduced developmental competence beyond the 2-cell stage ( P = 0.02). To account for these findings , we analysed the efficacy of DSB resolution , revealing a significant reduction in DSB lesions<symptom> 4 h post-ETP treatment. Notably , this response was completely abrogated by pharmacological inhibition of key elements ( DNA-PKcs and DNA ligase IV) of the canonical non-homologous end joining DNA repair pathway , thus providing the first evidence implicating this reparative cascade in the protection of the maternal genome.
