 As calcium and phosphorus are of vital importance for life , physiological activity of the parathyroid glands ( PTGs) is crucial to maintain mineral homeostasis and bone mineralization. However , PTG-specific molecular routes in response to environmental factors and intrinsic hormonal responses are not yet fully understood. Since nutrient requirements , pathophysiology and functional genomics of pigs are similar to those of humans , pigs might be a suitable model to study the holistic gene expression and physiological aspects of the parathyroid gland , which could be used in both animal sciences and biomedical research. However , due to their small size and hidden location , the dissection of the PTGs , particularly in pigs , is difficult. Therefore , a protocol for untrained dissectors has been established that allows a fast and reliable identification of the PTGs in domestic pigs. Based on their localization within the cranial thymus near the carotid bifurcation , sampling was verified by histological staining and mRNA expression pattern. Analyses revealed the prominence of parathyroid hormone ( PTH)- producing chief cells. Moreover , the copy numbers of PTH differed substantially between the PTGs and their surrounding thymus tissue , as PTH was expressed virtually exclusively in the PTGs. The developed protocol will substantially facilitate a fast and reliable dissection of porcine PTGs which is essential for studies characterizing the molecular mechanisms of parathyroid glands , e.g. when applying new feeding strategies in pigs.
