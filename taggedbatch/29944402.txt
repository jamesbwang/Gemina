 Sixty-four cases of white chick syndrome<disease><symptom> ( WCS) in broiler breeders producing affected progeny were reported from seven hatcheries in Ontario , Canada , between 2009 and 2016 , with 43 of those originating from two hatcheries owned by a single company. WCS cases were identified by the presence of typical chicks in the hatchery that were generally weak with pale to white down , enlarged abdomens , and occasionally brown wiry fluff on the dorsum of the neck. Affected embryos and chicks had characteristic gross and histologic liver lesions<symptom> , and livers were positive for chicken astrovirus<pathogen> ( CAstV) RNA by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. Affected broiler breeder flocks experienced egg production drops of 0 % to 21 % and hatchability drops of 0 % to 68.4 %. The amino acid sequence of the region encoding the capsid gene of WCS viruses demonstrated all Ontario CAstV to be in Group B , Subgroup Bii.
