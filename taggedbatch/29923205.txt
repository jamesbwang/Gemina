 Hand eczema<disease><symptom> ( HE) in healthcare workers ( HCWs) is common. Besides wet work , healthcare work also implies exposure to contact allergens. To assess HE and contact allergy related to occupational exposures in HCWs. In a cross-sectional study , 311 HCWs with HE within the preceding 12 months and a control group of 114 HCWs without HE were investigated with the baseline series and a special patch test series based on substances found in the gloves , soaps , alcoholic hand disinfectants and hand creams provided at the hospitals. Contact allergy to rubber additives was significantly more common in HCWs with HE ( 6 %) than in HCWs without HE ( 1 % , P = .02). The corresponding percentages for fragrances were 11 % and 3 % , respectively ( P = .004). Occupational HE was found in 193 of 311 ( 62 %) HCWs. Of these , 22 of 193 ( 11 %) had occupational allergic contact dermatitis<disease> , including 17 with glove-related rubber contact allergy. Contact allergy to diphenylguanidine was as common as contact allergy to thiurams. Occupational contact allergy to rubber additives was significantly associated with sick-leave related to HE. Contact allergy to rubber additives in medical gloves is the most common cause of occupational allergic contact dermatitis<disease> in HCWs. Aimed patch testing with relevant rubber additives is mandatory when HE in HCWs is investigated.
