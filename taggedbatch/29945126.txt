 To analyse superficial peripapillary vascularization in non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy ( NAION) at acute and atrophic ( 3 months) stage. Prospective case-control study including 6 patients with NAION and 10 age-matched healthy controls evaluated with optical coherence tomography angiography ( OCT-A; Angioplex-Cirrus) at acute and atrophic stage. Apart from the- commercially provided measurements for vessel density ( VD) and perfusion density ( PD) , a custom image analysis was used to quantify the peripapillary capillary density ( PCD). NAION-group demonstrated a significant decrease in the PCD , VD and PD compared with fellow unaffected and control groups at acute and atrophic stage. At 3 months , the average and the temporal sector in PCD correlated with logMAR VA ( -0.943 , p = 0.005 and -0.829 , p = 0.042 for average and temporal sectors respectively) and with MD ( 0.943 , p = 0.005; and 0.899; p = 0.015 , respectively). Over 3 months , there was a significant PCD reduction at the temporal sector and at the inner circle in VD and PD , which correlated with ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer ( GCIPL) thinning over the 3 months period after the acute NAION ( 0.749 , p = 0.020; 0.885 , p = 0.002; 0.767 , p = 0.016 respectively). Both strategies demonstrated a significant peripapillary microvascular dropout in NAION , but the customized analysis detected them- earlier. A progressive vessel reduction occurs within the first 3 months , which correlates with GCIPL thinning.
