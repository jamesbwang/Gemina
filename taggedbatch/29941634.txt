 The mechanisms for improved glycemic control after bariatric surgery in subjects with type 2 diabetes ( T2D) are not fully known. We hypothesized that dynamic hepatic blood responses to a mixed-meal are changed after bariatric surgery in parallel with an improvement in glucose tolerance. A total of ten morbidly obese subjects with T2D were recruited to receive a mixed-meal and a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP) infusion before and early after ( within a median of less than three months) bariatric surgery , and hepatic blood flow and volume ( HBV) were measured repeatedly with combined positron emission tomography/MRI. Ten lean non-diabetic individuals served as controls. Bariatric surgery leads to a significant decrease in weight , accompanied with an improved Î²-cell function and glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1) secretion , and a reduction in liver volume. Blood flow in portal vein ( PV) was increased by 1.65-fold ( Early after bariatric surgery , PV flow response to a mixed-meal is augmented , improving digestion and nutrient absorption. GIP influences the post-prandial reduction in HBV thereby diverting blood<symptom> to the extrahepatic sites.
