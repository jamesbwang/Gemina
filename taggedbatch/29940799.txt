 Macroautophagy/autophagy is a conserved process in eukaryotes that contributes to cell survival in response to stress. Previously , we found that endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress induces autophagy in plants via a pathway dependent upon AT5G24360/IRE1B ( INOSITOL REQUIRING 1-1) , an ER membrane-anchored factor involved in the splicing of AT1G42990/BZIP60 ( basic leucine zipper protein 60) mRNA. IRE1B is a dual protein kinase and ribonuclease , and here we determined the involvement of the protein kinase catalytic domain , nucleotide binding and RNase domains of IRE1B in activating autophagy. We found that the nucleotide binding and RNase activity of IRE1B , but not its protein kinase activity or splicing target BZIP60 , are required for ER stress-mediated autophagy. Upon ER stress , the RNase activity of IRE1B engages in regulated IRE1-dependent decay of messenger RNA ( RIDD) , in which mRNAs of secreted proteins are degraded by IRE1 upon ER stress. Twelve genes most highly targeted by RIDD were tested for their role in inhibiting ER stress-induced autophagy , and 3 of their encoded proteins , AT1G66270/BGLU21 ( Î²-glucosidase 21) , AT2G16005/ROSY1/ML ( MD2-related lipid recognition protein) and AT5G01870/PR -14 ( pathogenesis-related protein 14) , were found to inhibit autophagy upon overexpression. From these findings , IRE1B is posited to be a `` licensing factor '' linking ER stress to autophagy by degrading the RNA transcripts of factors that interfere with the induction of autophagy.
