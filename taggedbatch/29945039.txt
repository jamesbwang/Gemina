 In this study , the effect of salt content ( 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 and 20 g/100 g dry basis) on the drying kinetics , adsorption isotherms , and quality characteristics of beef slices were investigated. Beef slices were salted and vacuum-dried at 70 °C , until a moisture content of 32 % ( dry basis). The adsorption isotherms of the dried beef slices were described at 25 °C. The drying time for beef slices at the salt contents of 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 and 20 g NaCl/100 g d.b. were 212 , 207 , 194 , 160 and 137 min respectively. Modified Henderson and Pabis , and Page models exhibited a better fit for the drying kinetics of beef slices than the other drying models tested. The adsorption isotherm of dried beef slices is typical Type-II , but the addition of salt led to this behavior to change to type III. The BET model ( R
