 According to their phenotypic features , the hereditary dentin defects in humans are categorized in two major classes: dentinogenesis imperfecta and dentin dysplasia. At its turn , the dentin dysplasia is subdivided in dentin dysplasia type I and dentin dysplasia type II , a milder clinical manifestation of the condition. Here we report the clinical and radiographic findings of dentin dysplasia type II in two members of a family , a young adult female and her mother. Except a mild shade change of the incisal margins in upper central incisors and left upper canine of the daughter no abnormal occlusal wear or crown shape change of the teeth were disclosed in both patients. However , confluent large pulp stones in the thistle-tube shaped pulp chambers and pulpal obliteration were a common finding. The condition was diagnosed as dentin dysplasia type II.
