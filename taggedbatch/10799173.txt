 Cancer-related fatigue<symptom> is one of the most prevalent symptoms that patients with cancer experience , but the mechanisms underlying it are unknown. We aimed to quantify and mechanistically evaluate the improvement in fatigue<symptom> related to administration of the Kampo medicine , Kamikihito. Initially , we recruited outpatients with urological diseases and compared fatigue<symptom> levels of 37 patients with cancer with a control group of 23 volunteers who had recovered completely from cancer or who were being treated for dysuria. Fatigue<symptom> level was estimated using an autonomic function analyzer. Then , Kamikihito was administered to another 35 patients treated with hormone or antitumor therapy for prostate cancer and metastatic renal cell cancer. Subjective fatigue<symptom> and other problems of the patients were assessed using the Chalder fatigue<symptom> scale , the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression<symptom> scale , and the Epworth sleepiness scale. Serum levels of derivatives of reactive oxygen species and biological antioxidant potential were also measured. Patients in the cancer treatment group experienced more fatigue<symptom> compared with the control patients when evaluated using an autonomic function analyzer. The group of 35 patients who were administered Kamikihito showed improved scores for fatigue<symptom> , depression<symptom> , and sleepiness. Autonomic nervous system balance<symptom> was also improved with Kamikihito administration. The Kamikihito group also had significantly lower reactive oxygen species metabolite levels and significantly higher antioxidant potential. Fatigue<symptom> was more serious in patients with cancer than in control patients. Kamikihito rescued this fatigue<symptom> and improved anxiety<symptom> and sleepiness. It restored autonomic nervous system balance<symptom> and antioxidant function.
