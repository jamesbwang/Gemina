 Healthy looking newborns may have severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID) , and neonatologists frequently are the first physicians to encounter these patients. Physicians usually have a high index of suspicion for this condition in presence of certain risk factors ( unexplained infants ' deaths , consanguinity); however , > 80 % of infants with SCID have no positive family history. A timely diagnosis of this condition is crucial in decreasing both mortality and morbidity. The only way to detect SCID prior to the onset of infections is newborn screening ( NBS). In term infants , NBS has 99.99 % sensitivity for SCID , with no false negatives. In preterm infants , screening is less accurate due to a lack of standard T cell receptor excision circle ( TREC) values in this age group. We report a case of SCID in term infants born to consanguineous parents who were presented with clinical and laboratory findings of erythroderma , severe infection , failure to thrive , eosinophilia , and elevated immunoglobulin E ( IgE) together with immunodeficiency. A timely diagnosis was followed by successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT) therapy.
