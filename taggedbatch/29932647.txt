 The thiol-maleimide linkage is widely used for antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC) production; however , conjugation of maleimide-drugs could be improved by simplified procedures and reliable conjugate stability. Here , we report the evaluation of electron-rich and cyclic dienes that can be appended to antibodies and reacted with maleimide-containing drugs through the Diels-Alder ( DA) reaction. Drug conjugation is fast and quantitative due to reaction acceleration in water , and the linkage is more stable in serum than in the corresponding thiol-maleimide adduct with the same drug. ADCs produced using the DA reaction ( DAADCs) are effective in vitro and in vivo , demonstrating the utility of this reaction in producing effective biotherapeutics. Given the large number of commercially available maleimide compounds , this conjugation approach could be readily applied to the production of a wide range of antibody ( or protein) conjugates.
