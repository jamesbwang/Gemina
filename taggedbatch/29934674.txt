 An optically active metallo-polymer assembly is demonstrated via conjugation of a genetically engineered elastin-like polypeptide ( ELP) and a ruthenium ( II) polypyridyl complex. By taking advantage of the phase transition of ELPs in water , photophysical properties of the resultant conjugate are investigated for both phases , below and above the critical transition temperature. Upon coacervation , the luminescence of the metallo-ELP is greatly enhanced as a consequence of local effects on the metal-ligand luminophore. These findings open a possibility to harness the temperature control of stimuli-responsive properties of biopolymers.
