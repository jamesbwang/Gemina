 The macroautophagic/autophagic machinery can not only target cell-endogenous components but also intracellular pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen>. Listeria<pathogen> are targeted both by canonical autophagy and by a noncanonical form of autophagy referred to as LC3-associated phagocytosis ( LAP). The molecular mechanisms involved and whether these processes contribute to anti-listerial immunity or rather provide Listeria<pathogen> with a replicative niche for persistent infection , however , remained unknown. Recently , using an in vivo mouse infection model , we have been able to demonstrate that Listeria<pathogen> in tissue macrophages are targeted exclusively by LAP. Furthermore , our data show that LAP is required for killing of Listeria<pathogen> by macrophages and thereby contributes to anti-listerial immunity of mice , whereas canonical autophagy is completely dispensable. Moreover , we have elucidated the molecular mechanisms that trigger LAP of Listeria<pathogen> and identified the integrin ITGAM-ITGB2/ Mac-1/ CR3/integrin Î±
