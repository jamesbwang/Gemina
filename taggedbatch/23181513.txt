 The ability of a cell to dynamically switch its chromatin between different functional states constitutes a key mechanism regulating gene expression. Histone mark `` readers '' display distinct binding specificity to different histone modifications and play critical roles in regulating chromatin states. Here , we show a plant-specific histone reader SHORT LIFE ( SHL) capable of recognizing both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 via its bromo-adjacent homology ( BAH) and plant homeodomain ( PHD) domains , respectively. Detailed biochemical and structural studies suggest a binding mechanism that is mutually exclusive for either H3K4me3 or H3K27me3. Furthermore , we show a genome-wide co-localization of SHL with H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 , and that BAH-H3K27me3 and PHD-H3K4me3 interactions are important for SHL-mediated floral repression. Together , our study establishes BAH-PHD cassette as a dual histone methyl-lysine binding module that is distinct from others in recognizing both active and repressive histone marks.
