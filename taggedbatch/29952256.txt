 Acute care hospitals are widely recognized as potentially high-risk environments for older adults. In 2010 , Mount Sinai Hospital conceived its Acute Care for Elders ( ACE) Strategy as a multi-component intervention to improve the care of hospitalized older adults. In order to determine its effectiveness , we conducted a quasi-experimental time series analysis of 12,008 older patients admitted non-electively for acute medical issues over a 6-year period. Despite a 53 % increase in annual admissions of older patients between 2009/2010 and 2014/2015 , Mount Sinai decreased total lengths of stay and readmissions and reduced the direct cost of care per patient , leading to net savings of CDN$ 4.2 million in 2014/2015. This article presents Mount Sinai 's ACE Strategy and discusses the benefits of implementing integrated evidence-based models across the continuum of care and how it is supporting the implementation of ACE Strategy models of care and care practices across Canada and beyond.
