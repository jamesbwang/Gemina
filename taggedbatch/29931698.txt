 In rare variant association studies , aggregating rare and/or low frequency variants , may increase statistical power for detection of the underlying susceptibility gene or region. However , it is unclear which variants , or class of them , in a gene contribute most to the association. We proposed a subregion-based burden test ( REBET) to simultaneously select susceptibility genes and identify important underlying subregions. The subregions are predefined by shared common biologic characteristics , such as the protein domain or functional impact. Based on a subset-based approach considering local correlations between combinations of test statistics of subregions , REBET is able to properly control the type I error rate while adjusting for multiple comparisons in a computationally efficient manner. Simulation studies show that REBET can achieve power competitive to alternative methods when rare variants cluster within subregions. In two case studies , REBET is able to identify known disease susceptibility genes , and more importantly pinpoint the unreported most susceptible subregions , which represent protein domains essential for gene function.
