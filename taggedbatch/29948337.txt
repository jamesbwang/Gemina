 A rapid results initiative ( RRI) aimed at increasing male involvement in prevention of mother-to-child transmission ( PMTCT) and service uptake among pregnant women at 116 antenatal clinics in Western Kenya was compared at baseline , during the RRI , and 3-months post-RRI. Male involvement increased from 7.4 to 54.2 % during RRI ( risk difference ( RD) 0.47 , CI 0.45-0.48) then 43.4 % post-RRI ( RD 0.36 , CI 0.35-0.37). Among HIV-infected women , facility delivery increased from 40.0 to 49.9 % ( RD 0.10 , 95 % CI 0.06-0.13) and 65.0 % post-RRI ( RD 0.25 , 95 % CI 0.22-0.28). HIV-infected pregnant women linkage to HIV<pathogen> care increased from 58.6 to 85.9 % ( RD 0.27 , CI 0.24-0.30) and 97.3 % post-RRI ( RD 0.39 , CI 0.36-0.41). Time to ART initiation reduced from 29 days ( interquartile range ( IQR) 6-56) to 14 days ( IQR 0-28) to 7 days ( IQR 0-20). A male-centered RRI can significantly increase men 's engagement in antenatal care leading to improved partner utilization of PMTCT and antenatal services.
