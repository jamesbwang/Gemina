 Soil near a Pb-Zn-Mn mine was polluted by mining , which may have an impact on human health via the food chain. To evaluate the pollution effects , arsenic ( As) , cadmium ( Cd) , chromium ( Cr) , copper ( Cu) , manganese ( Mn) , lead ( Pb) , and zinc ( Zn) in vegetables were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission and mass spectrometry. Lead species were analyzed by X-ray absorption near-edge structure ( XANES). Phytoavailability of the elements was evaluated by bioaccumulation of the elements , the sequential extraction procedure , Pb species , and plant uptakes. The target health quotient ( THQ) was calculated to evaluate the human health risks. It was found that ( 1) high concentrations of As , Cd , Cr , and Pb were detectable in vegetables , and bioaccumulation was in the order of Mn > Zn > Cr > Pb > Cu > As > Cd; ( 2) phytoavailability of the elements was controlled mainly by the soluble fraction , and a linear relationship observed between the soluble fraction and bioaccumulation; ( 3) a new Pb-fulvic acid complex ( Pb-FA) was identified by XANES in rhizosphere soil , and high content of Pb organic matter ( 60 %) and soluble Pb ( 18 %) were found; ( 4) both Cd and Zn accumulated in both of the Amaranthaceae and the Apiaceae families , indicating that the plants in the same family have the same bioaccumulation trend for the elements in the same group; ( 5) agricultural activities and plant growing increased phytoavailability of As , Cd , Cu , Pb , and Zn by decreasing the residual and raising the soluble and extractable fractions; ( 6) arsenic is top of the high health risks , followed by Pb , Cd , and Mn. Coriander , celery , and spinach were the top three highest health risks in the area.
