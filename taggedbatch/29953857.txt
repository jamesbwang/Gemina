 Within the extracellular domains of metastasis suppressor CD82 , the large extracellular loop ( EC2) has received much of the attention and its structure and function have been studied in detail. However , little attention has been given to the small extracellular loop ( EC1 domain). To investigate the function role of EC1 in metastasis suppression of CD82 , the peptide mimicking EC1 amino acid sequence ( EC1-mP) was synthesized and its effect on cancer cells behavior was examined. Here , we reported that EC1-mP strongly inhibited cancer cell migration in vitro , attnuated the ability of cancer cells adhesion to fibronectin , and induced the apoptosis. Furthermore , the EC1-mP was showed to supprese the expressions of integrins α5 and β1 , as well as decreased the phosphorylation of FAK and expression of ILK in SW620 cells. Taken together , these results demonstrate that this small peptide has the functional role of CD82 intact molecule. This novel finding will improve our understanding of the mechanism by which CD82 inhibits metastasis , and suggested that EC1 mimic peptide may be a promising candidate for developing anti-metastasis drugs.
