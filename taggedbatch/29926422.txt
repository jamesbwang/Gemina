 Determination of a glycolipid ligand can quickly reveal the carbohydrate epitope recognized by carbohydrate-binding proteins ( CBP) which may include antibodies , lectins , toxins , and virulence factors. Thin layer chromatography ( TLC) is a simple , well-known , and heavily used method to separate glycolipids based on their migration through a thin layer of chromatography media , usually silica gel , coated on the surface of a rigid plate. Reacting carbohydrate-binding proteins directly on a TLC plate of separated glycolipids is a powerful technique to quickly determine functional carbohydrate epitopes present in an entire glycolipid extract of a target cell type or tissue.
