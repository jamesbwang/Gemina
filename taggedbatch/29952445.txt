 We present the case of a 71-year-old lady with a background of significant alcohol intake who presented with frank lower gastrointestinal ( GI) bleeding , lower abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and haemoglobin 6.3 g/dL. CT abdominal angiogram showed right-sided colonic thickening , atrophic liver and enlarged superior mesenteric vein ( SMV) and right-sided pelvic varix. This lead to a diagnosis of portal hypertensive colopathy secondary to alcoholic liver cirrhosis. The patient failed conservative management and underwent a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt ( TIPSS) procedure. This lead to an immediate resolution of her lower-GI bleeding. Repeat CT at three weeks showed a decompressed SMV and resolution of the right-sided pelvic varix. The patient was discharged after three months following optimization of medical condition and social circumstances.
