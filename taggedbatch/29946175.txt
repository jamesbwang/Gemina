 Prisons are major reservoirs of hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) in which a therapeutic approach has been particularly difficult so far. Our aim was to create a permanent program of HCV<pathogen> elimination in a prison based on a `` test and treat '' strategy. This open-label clinical trial was conducted in the Spanish prison `` El Dueso '' between May 2016 and July 2017. Viremic patients were treated with a ledipasvir-sofosbuvir regimen ( 8-12 weeks) according to the 2015 Spanish Guidelines. A teleconsultation program was established to follow-up patients from the hospital. Non-responders were submitted for a phylogenetic analysis and offered retreatment. An evaluation of new cases of HCV<pathogen> infection was performed every 6 months and upon release in all inmates. 847 ( 99.5 %) inmates accepted to participate. HCV<pathogen> antibodies were present in 110 ( 13.0 %) and 86 ( 10.2 %) had detectable viremia. Most of them were genotype 1 or 3 ( 82.6 %) and had < F2 fibrosis<disease> ( 52.2 %). Treatment was started in the 69 inmates whose stay in prison was longer than 30 days. Sustained virological response was achieved in 64 out of 66 patients ( 96.9 %) , three of whom were successfully rescued with a salvage regimen after treatment failure. Two patients were lost to follow-up and three are currently on treatment without viremia. As a result , by July 2017 none of the 409 imprisoned was viremic , and neither reinfections nor de novo infections were detected. A sustained `` test-and-treat '' strategy against HCV<pathogen> in prisons is feasible and beneficial. Spreading this strategy should entail a public health impact.
