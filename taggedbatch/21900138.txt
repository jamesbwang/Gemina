 To assess the impact of computerized transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE) simulation on the learning curve to achieve competency in basic critical care echocardiography ( CCE). In this prospective bicenter study , noncardiologist residents novice in ultrasound followed either a previously validated training program with adjunctive computerized simulation on a mannequin ( two 3 h-sessions; Vimedix simulator , CAE Healthcare) ( interventional group; n = 12) or solely the same training program ( control group; n = 12). All trainees from the same institution were assigned to the same study group to avoid confusion<symptom> bias. Each trainee was evaluated after 1 ( M1) , 3 ( M3) and 6 ( M6) months of training using our previously validated scoring system. Competency was defined by a score ≥ 90 % of the maximal value. The 24 trainees performed 965 TTE in patients with cardiopulmonary compromise during their 6-month rotation. Skills assessments relied on 156 TTE performed in 106 patients ( mean age 53 ± 14 years; mean Simplified Acute Physiologic Score 2: 55 ± 19; 79 % ventilated). When compared to the control group , trainees of the interventional group obtained a significantly higher mean skills assessment score at M1 ( 41.5 ± 4.9 vs. 32.3 ± 3.7: P = 0.0004) and M3 ( 45.8 ± 2.8 vs. 42.3 ± 3.7: P = 0.0223) , but not at M6 ( 49.7 ± 1.2 vs. 50.0 ± 2.7: P = 0.6410) , due to higher practical and technical skills scores. Trainees of the control group required significantly more supervised TTE to obtain competency than their counterparts ( 36 ± 7 vs. 30 ± 9: p = 0.0145). Adjunctive computerized simulation accelerates the learning curve of basic CCE in improving practical and technical skills and reduces the number of TTE examinations required to reach competency.
