 Opioids have many beneficial uses in medicine , but , taken inappropriately , they can cause life-threatening health effects. The increasing use of physician-prescribed and illicit opioids , including highly potent fentanyl and its analogs , have contributed to a significant increase in opioid-related drug overdoses in the United States , leading to a public health emergency. There have been a number of reports describing adverse health effects experienced by police officers , fire-fighter emergency medical services providers , and private sector ambulance personnel when responding to drug overdose incidents. Several sets of exposure prevention recommendations for first responders are available from government and the private sector. Understanding the scientific basis for these recommendations , increasing awareness by responders of the potential risks associated with opioid exposure during a response , and educating responders about safe work practices when exposure to opioids is suspected or confirmed are all critical prevention measures that can keep first responders safe.
