 Previously , we had shown that a vasopeptidase inhibitor drug containing ACE and neprilysin inhibitors was an effective treatment for diabetic vascular and neural complications. However , side effects prevented further development. This led to the development of sacubitril/valsartan , a drug containing angiotensin II receptor blocker and neprilysin inhibitor that we hypothesized would be an effective treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Using early and late intervention protocols ( 4 and 12 weeks posthyperglycemia , respectively) , type 2 diabetic rats were treated with valsartan or sacubitril/valsartan for 12 weeks followed by an extensive evaluation of vascular and neural end points. The results demonstrated efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan in improving vascular and neural function was superior to valsartan alone. In the early intervention protocol , sacubitril/valsartan treatment was found to slow progression of these deficits and , with late intervention treatment , was found to stimulate restoration of vascular reactivity , motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities , and sensitivity/regeneration of sensory nerves of the skin and cornea in a rat model of type 2 diabetes. These preclinical studies suggest that sacubitril/valsartan may be an effective treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy , but additional studies will be needed to investigate these effects further.
