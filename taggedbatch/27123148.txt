 Diffuse giant cell tumors of the tendon sheath ( GCT-TS) in the temporomandibular joint ( TMJ) are extremely rare. We reported the imaging appearance and the pathological findings of 2 male cases with diffuse GCT-TS in the TMJ ( 52 years for the case 1 and 50 years for the case 2) who complain of the hearing disorders of left ear when presenting to our hospital. Preoperative computerized tomography ( CT) scan revealed an irregular mass in the left temporal fossa with the sizes of approximately 5.8 × 3.8 × 4.6 cm for case 1 and 4.2 × 3.2 × 4.3 cm for case 2 , respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) findings showed a mass of 6.1 × 4.0 × 5.1 cm and 5.3 × 3.6 × 3.3 cm , respectively. Postoperative pathological examination revealed the diffuse multinucleated giant cells accompanied with synovial cells in the diffuse arrangement. Immunohistochemical examination showed CD68 ( +) , Vim ( +) , S-100 (-) and 2 % of Ki-67 proliferation index. These characteristics are in line with the diagnosis of the diffuse GCT-TS in the TMJ. Both cases underwent the gross total resection followed by radiation therapy. Two patients experienced no recurrence after follow-up of 1 to 2 year ( s). Diffuse GCT-TS in the TMJ is very rare. Clinicians should keep in mind the possibility of the GCT-TS when aggressive<symptom> lesions<symptom> involve the TMJ and adjacent bone destruction was found. Careful pre- and postoperative examinations and complete resection are the factors that lead to its optimal treatment , significantly reducing its recurrence rate.
