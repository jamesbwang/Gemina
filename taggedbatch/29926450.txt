 In spite of its greatly scientific and technological importance , developing rapid , low cost and sensitive microarray sensors for onsite monitoring heavy metal contamination remains challenging. Here we develop a DNA nanostructured microarray ( DNM) with a tubular three-dimensional sensing surface and an ordered nanotopography for rapid and sensitive multiplex detection of heavy metal ions. In our design , DNA tetrahedral-structured probes ( TSPs) are used to engineer the sensing interface with spatially resolved and density-tunable sensing spots , improving the micro-confined molecular recognition. Meanwhile , a bubble-mediated shuttle reaction inside the DNM-functionalized microchannel improves the target-capturing efficiency. Thus , the sensitive and selective detection of multiple heavy metal ions ( i.e. , Hg
