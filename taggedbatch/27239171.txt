 Despite advancements in the treatment of primary and metastatic breast cancer , many patients lack a durable response to these treatments. Patients with triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2)- positive breast cancer who do not have a pathological complete response ( pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT) have a very poor prognosis. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs) have been identified as a predictive marker for pCR after NACT in TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer. These patient populations could also be suitable for novel treatment strategies including neoepitope-based therapies. This work analyses the effect of TILs on the pCR in neoadjuvantly treated patients in the TILGen study and presents the procedures aimed at establishing neoepitope-based therapies in this study. Neoadjuvantly treated HER2-positive and TNBC patients were eligible for the presented analysis concerning the association between TILs and pCR. A total of 146 patients could be identified within the TILGen study. TILs were evaluated as percentage of stromal tumor tissue in core biopsies at primary diagnosis. The phenotype ` lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer ' ( LPBC) was associated with pCR by logistic regression adjusted for estrogen receptor status , progesterone receptor status , HER2 status , age at diagnosis , and grading. LPBC was seen in 24 ( 16.4 %) patients. In this patient group , 66.7 % achieved a pCR , while the pCR rate was 32.8 % in patients with a low TIL count. The adjusted odds ratio was 6.60 ( 95 % confidence interval 2.02-21.56; p < 0.01). TILs are a strong predictor of pCR in TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Implications for the use of this information including the effect on prognosis might help to identify patients most likely to benefit from a neoepitope-based therapy approach.
