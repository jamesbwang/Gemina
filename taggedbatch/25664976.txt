 The present study aimed to evaluate whether the neoadjuvant chemoradiation response with concurrent thermal therapy for the treatment of rectal cancer can be predicted following the first thermic treatment. Eighty patients with primary rectal adenocarcinoma ( â‰¤ 12 cm from the anal verge) were included in this study. Fifty-four received surgery and pathological response was evaluated. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy was administered conventionally once daily 5 times/week. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy consisted of 50 Gy delivered to the planning target volume in 25 fractions. Concurrent neoadjuvant chemotherapy was delivered in 5-day courses. Capecitabine was administered orally at 1,700 mg/m
