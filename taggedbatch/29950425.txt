 Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus<pathogen> ( KSHV)/ Human herpesvirus-8 ( HHV-8) causes the angiogenic tumor Kaposi 's Sarcoma<disease> ( KS) and two B-cell malignancies. The KSHV non-structural membrane protein encoded by open reading frame ( orf<pathogen>) K15 recruits and activates several cellular proteins including PLCγ1 , components of the NF-κB pathway as well as members of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases and thereby plays an important role in the activation of angiogenic and inflammatory pathways that contribute to the pathogenesis of KS as well as KSHV productive ( lytic) replication. In order to identify novel cellular components involved in the biology of pK15 , we immunoprecipitated pK15 from KSHV-infected endothelial cells and identified associated proteins by label free quantitative mass spectrometry. Cellular proteins interacting with pK15 point to previously unappreciated cellular processes such as the endocytic pathway that could be involved in the function of pK15. We found the class II PI3K , PI3K-C2α , which is involved in the endocytosis of activated receptor tyrosine kinases and their signaling from intracellular organelles , to interact and co-localize with pK15 in vesicular structures abundant in the perinuclear area. Further functional analysis revealed that PI3K-C2α contributes to the pK15-dependent phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and Erk1/2. PI3K-C2α also plays a role in KSHV lytic replication as evidenced by the reduced expression of viral lytic genes K-bZIP and ORF<pathogen> 45 as well as the reduced release of infectious<disease> virus in PI3K-C2α- depleted KSHV-infected endothelial cells. Taken together , our results suggest a role of the cellular PI3K-C2α protein in the functional properties of the KSHV pK15 protein.
