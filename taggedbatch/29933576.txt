 Culture-independent studies have identified DNA of bacterial pathogens in the gallbladder under pathological conditions , yet reports on the isolation of corresponding live bacteria are rare. Thus , it is unclear which pathogens , or pathogen communities , can colonize the gallbladder and cause disease. Using light microscopy , scanning electron microscopy , culture techniques , phylogenetic analysis , urease assays and Western blotting , we investigated the presence of live bacterial communities in the gallbladder of a cholecystitis<disease> patient after cholecystectomy. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of isolated bacterial colonies revealed the presence of pathogens most closely resembling
