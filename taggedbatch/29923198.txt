 The postovulatory follicle ( POF) in birds is an enigmatic structure , the function of which remains largely unknown. Previous studies on chickens have shown that removal of POFs leads to the postponement of oviposition and the disturbance of broody behavior. One suggestion is that POFs may secrete some crucial hormones or cytokines to act on reproductive organs. However , such secretions and their specific target organs remain to be identified. Here , we investigate the putative functions of POFs in promoting the development of prehierarchical follicles in chickens and explore the possible signaling mechanisms controlling these processes. Results show that POFs express steroidogenic acute regulatory protein ( STAR) , cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme ( CYP11A1) , cyclooxygenase 1 ( COX1) , and COX2 in granulosa<pathogen> cells ( GCs) , and , most notably , that POF1 produces more prostaglandin E2 ( PGE
