 Water quality security within water distribution systems ( WDSs) has been an important issue due to their inherent vulnerability associated with contamination intrusion. This motivates intensive studies to identify optimal water quality sensor placement ( WQSP) strategies , aimed to timely/effectively detect ( un) intentional intrusion events. However , these available WQSP optimization methods have consistently presumed that each WDS node has an equal contamination probability. While being simple in implementation , this assumption may do not conform to the fact that the nodal contamination probability may be significantly regionally varied owing to variations in population density and user properties. Furthermore , the low computational efficiency is another important factor that has seriously hampered the practical applications of the currently available WQSP optimization approaches. To address these two issues , this paper proposes an efficient multi-objective WQSP optimization method to explicitly account for contamination probability variations. Four different contamination probability functions ( CPFs) are proposed to represent the potential variations of nodal contamination probabilities within the WDS. Two real-world WDSs are used to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method. Results show that WQSP strategies can be significantly affected by the choice of the CPF. For example , when the proposed method is applied to the large case study with the CPF accounting for user properties , the event detection probabilities of the resultant solutions are approximately 65 % , while these values are around 25 % for the traditional approach , and such design solutions are achieved approximately 10,000 times faster than the traditional method. This paper provides an alternative method to identify optimal WQSP solutions for the WDS , and also builds knowledge regarding the impacts of different CPFs on sensor deployments.
