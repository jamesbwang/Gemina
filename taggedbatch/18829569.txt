 Melanoma-associated antigen A ( MAGEA) represent a class of tumor antigens that are expressed in a variety of malignant tumors , however , their expression in healthy normal tissues is restricted to germ cells of testis , fetal ovary and placenta. The restricted expression and immunogenicity of these antigens make them ideal targets for immunotherapy in human cancer. In the present study the presence of naturally occurring antibodies against two MAGEA subfamily proteins , MAGEA4 and MAGEA10 , was analyzed in patients with melanoma at different stages of disease. Results indicated that the anti-MAGEA4/ MAGEA10 immune response in melanoma patients was heterogeneous , with only ~ 8 % of patients having a strong response. Comparing the number of strongly responding patients between different stages of disease revealed that the highest number of strong responses was detected among stage II melanoma patients. These findings support the model that the immune system is involved in the control of melanoma in the early stages of disease.
