 The ginsenoside Rg1 , the primary pharmacologically active ingredient of the traditional Chinese herb ginseng , is widely used in the clinical treatment of diseases of the immune and nervous systems. Recent studies have shown that it also has an antitumor effect. In this study , we explored the effects of Rg1 on hepatoblastoma ( HB) and its underlying mechanisms. We demonstrated that Rg1 significantly inhibited HB cell growth both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistic studies revealed that Rg1 impaired homologous recombination and triggered double-strand breaks in HB cells by directly targeting CtBP-interacting protein ( CtIP) , a key double-strand break repair factor , which is highly expressed in HB tissues. Moreover , we also demonstrated that Rg1 sensitized HB cells to DNA-damaging agents both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion , our data not only demonstrate the potential clinical application of Rg1 as a novel chemotherapeutic candidate but also offer a mechanism-based therapeutic option by which DNA-damaging agents can be used in combination with Rg1 to target HB.
