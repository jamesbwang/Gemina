 The INHIBITOR OF MERISTEM ACTIVITY in tomato ( SlIMA) and MINI<pathogen> ZINC FINGER 2 in Arabidopsis ( AtMIF2) , two members of the MINI<pathogen> ZINC FINGER family ( MIF) , are involved in the regulation of flower and ovule development. MIF proteins possess a unique non-canonical zinc-finger domain that confers the capacity to interact with other protein partners. The characterization of SlIMA and AtMIF2 gain- and loss-of-function transgenic lines in Solanum lycopersicum and Arabidopsis thaliana respectively , allowed the demonstration of their conserved functional role in the termination of floral stem cell maintenance. During early floral development , the expression of SlIMA and AtMIF2 is induced by the MADS-Box transcription factor AGAMOUS ( AG). Then , SlIMA or AtMIF2 protein recruits the C
