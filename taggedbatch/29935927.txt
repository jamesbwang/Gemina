 The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the magnitude of effect for a new topical rinse that may impact oral soreness<symptom> and function in ulcerative oral mucosal lesions<symptom>. Twenty-five consecutive patients with ulcerative/erosion lesion<symptom> and moderate<symptom> pain<symptom> visual analogue pain score ( â‰¥ 4) rated their mouth<symptom> and throat<symptom> soreness<symptom> and oral symptoms at baseline and at 24 , 48 , and 72 hours after open-label use of a chitosan-based , nonanesthetic oral rinse ( Synvaza) at least twice a day. No changes in prior therapy , including analgesics , were allowed during the trial. All measures of oral soreness<symptom> decreased in severity from baseline to 72 hours , and overall oral soreness<symptom> decreased by 28 % ( P < .01). Oral soreness<symptom> associated with talking decreased by 67 % ( P < .01) , drinking by 62 % ( P < .01) , swallowing by 56 % ( P = .04) , sleeping by 51 % ( P = .02) and eating by 50 % ( P < .01). The product was rated favorably for texture , flavor , soothing relief , mouth<symptom> feel , and burning/stinging with use. Oral rinsing with the study product reduced mucosal pain without anesthetic effect and improved oral function.
