 Microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS) have become a ubiquitous part of a multitude of industries including transportation , communication , medical , and consumer products. The majority of commercial MEMS devices are produced from silicon using energy-intensive and harsh chemical processing. We report that actuatable standard MEMS devices such as cantilever beam arrays , doubly clamped beams , residual strain testers , and mechanical strength testers can be produced via low-temperature fabrication of shear-aligned cellulose nanocrystal ( CNC) films. The devices had feature sizes as small as 6 μm and anisotropic mechanical properties. For 4 μm thick doubly clamped beams with the CNC aligned parallel to the devices ' long axes , the Young 's moduli averaged 51 GPa and the fracture strength averaged 1.1 GPa. These mechanical properties are within one-third of typical values for polysilicon devices. This new paradigm of producing MEMS devices from CNC extracted from waste biomass provides the simplicity and tunability of fluid-phase processing while enabling anisotropic mechanical properties on the order of those obtained in standard silicon MEMS.
