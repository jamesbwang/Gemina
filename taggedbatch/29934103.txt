 Ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous group of cancers that differ by cell of origin and genomic features. High-grade serous ovarian cancer ( HGSOC) is the commonest histiotype and is characterized by extreme genomic complexity and dysregulation of DNA damage repair pathways , particularly homologous recombination deficiency. New insights from molecular profiling into homologous recombination deficiency now offers the credible possibility of personalizing treatment choices for women with HGSOC using poly ( ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor ( PARP) therapy. Although the presence of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs) in the microenvironment is associated with improved survival in HGSOC , the role of anti-angiogenic and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy remains unclear. PARP inhibition combined with immunotherapy is an exciting combination strategy for future therapeutic development for women with advanced HGSOC.
