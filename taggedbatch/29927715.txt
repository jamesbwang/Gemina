 While drugs remain the cornerstone of medicine , herbal medicine is an important comedication worldwide. Thus , precision medicine ought to face this clinical reality and develop `` companion diagnostics '' for drugs as well as herbal medicines. Yet , many are in denial with respect to the extent of use of traditional/herbal medicines , overlooking that a considerable number of contemporary therapeutic drugs trace their discovery from herbal medicines. This expert review underscores that absent such appropriate attention on both classical drug therapy and herbal medicines , precision medicine biomarkers will likely not stand the full test of clinical practice while patients continue to use both drugs and herbal medicines and , yet the biomarker research and applications focus only ( or mostly) on drug therapy. This asymmetry in biomarker innovation strategy needs urgent attention from a wide range of innovation actors worldwide , including governments , research funders , scientists , community leaders , civil society organizations , herbal , pharmaceutical , and insurance industries , policymakers , and social/political scientists. We discuss the various dimensions of a future convergence map between herbal and conventional medicine , and conclude with a set of concrete strategies on how best to integrate biomarker research in a realm of both herbal and drug treatment. Africa , by virtue of its vast experience and exposure in herbal medicine and a `` pregnant '' life sciences innovation ecosystem , could play a game-changing role for the `` birth '' of biomarker-informed personalized herbal medicine in the near future. At this critical juncture when precision medicine initiatives are being rolled out worldwide , precision/personalized herbal medicine is both timely and essential for modern therapeutics , not to mention biomarker innovations that stand the test of real-life practices and implementation in the clinic and society.
