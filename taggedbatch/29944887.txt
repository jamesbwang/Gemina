 Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) have been identified to modulate the tumorigenesis of human cancers. The in-depth of lncRNAs on human osteosarcoma oncogenesis is still ambiguous. In present study , functional and mechanism experiments were conducted to investigate the role of long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 00858 ( LINC00858) on human osteosarcoma tumorigenesis. Results demonstrated that LINC00858 expression was significantly upregulated in both osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines. Mechanism assays presented that LINC00858 silencing significantly repressed osteosarcoma cells ' proliferation and invasion in vitro , and inhibited the tumor growth in vivo. In further experiments , LINC00858 was identified to sponge miR-139 to form RNA-induced silencing complex ( RISC) using luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation ( RIP). Besides , CDK14 was validated to be the target protein the miR-139. Rescue experiments confirmed the role of LINC00858/miR -139/ CDK14 pathway on osteosarcoma cells ' phenotype. In summary , these data prove that LINC00858/miR -139/ CDK14 axis promotes the tumorigenesis of osteosarcoma , providing a new mechanism or target for osteosarcoma.
