 Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death characterized by the accumulation of lipid-targeting reactive oxygen species that kill cells by damaging their plasma membrane. The lipid-repair enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 ( GPX4) protects against this oxidative damage and enables cells to resist ferroptosis. Recent work has revealed that matrix-detached carcinoma cells can be susceptible to ferroptosis and that they can evade this fate through the signaling properties of the α6β4 integrin , which sustains GPX4 expression. Although these findings on ferroptosis are provocative , they differ from those in previous studies indicating that matrix-detached cells are prone to apoptosis , via a process referred to as anoikis. In an effort to reconcile these discrepant findings , here we observed that matrix-detached epithelial and carcinoma cells cluster spontaneously via a mechanism that involves the cell adhesion protein PVRL4 ( also known as Nectin-4). We found that this clustering process allows these cells to survive by stimulating a PVRL4/α6β4/Src signaling axis that sustains GPX4 expression and buffers against lipid peroxidation. In the absence of α6β4 , PVRL4-mediated clustering induced an increase in lipid peroxidation that was sufficient for triggering ferroptosis. When the clustering was inhibited , single cells did not exhibit a significant increase in lipid peroxidation in the absence of α6β4 , and they were more susceptible to apoptosis than to ferroptosis. These results indicate that ferroptosis induction depends on cell clustering in matrix-detached cells that lack α6β4 and imply that the fate of matrix-detached cells can be determined by the state of their cell-cell interactions.
