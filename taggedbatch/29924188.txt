 We aimed to evaluate the effects of oral propranolol for circumscribed choroidal hemangioma. In this prospective , longitudinal interventional study , we administered oral propranolol at a dosage of 1.5 mg/kg/day to five patients with circumscribed choroidal hemangioma. We then evaluated visual acuity , binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy , optical coherence tomography , optical coherence tomography angiography , fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography , and ocular ultrasonography at regular intervals and compared changes from the baseline assessments. No clinical or diagnostic changes were observed in the sizes of the circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas during treatment. Complications due to the hemangioma were reduced in the first four months of treatment , followed by maintenance , before worsening in the subsequent three months. The study showed that oral propranolol at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day did not offer effective monotherapy in the treatment of circumscribed choroidal hemangioma.
