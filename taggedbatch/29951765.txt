 Enantioselectivity in environmental behavior and toxic effect of chiral pesticides has been received much attention. In this study , enantioselective bioactivity towards target organism Botrytis<pathogen> cinerea<pathogen> , acute toxicity and bioaccumulation in Eisenia fetida , and degradation in five kinds of soil under laboratory conditions regarding triazole fungicide tebuconazole were investigated. The results showed that fungicidal activity to Botrytis<pathogen> cinerea<pathogen> of R- (-)- tebuconazole was 44 times higher than S- ( +)- tebuconazole with an order of R- (-)- tebuconazole > rac-tebuconazole > S- ( +)- tebuconazole. No significant difference was found in acute toxicity of rac- , R- , and S-tebuconazole to E. fetida with 48-h EC
