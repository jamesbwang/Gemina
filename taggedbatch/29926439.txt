 Although the benefits of sauna bathing have been demonstrated in epidemiological studies , sauna deaths have been reported. The aim of this study was to determine the demographic and forensic characteristics associated with different blood alcohol concentrations ( BACs) in sauna deaths in Korea. In this retrospective analysis , data were collected from a nationwide pool in Korea between January 2008 and December 2015 to determine the role of alcohol intoxication in sauna deaths based on the subjects ' BAC and to evaluate the demographic and forensic characteristics associated with different BACs. One hundred and three deaths were classified into 2 groups: the non-intoxication ( NI) group ( BAC , < 0.08 %; n = 27) and the intoxication ( I) group ( BAC , â‰¥ 0.08 %; n = 76). Demographic and forensic characteristics were compared between the groups using a multinomial logistic regression analysis. The proportions of decedents who were male ( odds ratio: 17.4 , 95.0 % confidence interval: 3.8-79.8) and in a prone position at the scene of death ( odds ratio: 11.3 , 95.0 % confidence interval: 2.1-60.1) were significantly higher ( P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 , retrospectively) in the I group than in the NI group. However , no significant differences were observed with respect to obesity , coronary artery narrowing , and liver pathology. Sauna deaths exhibited different characteristics according to BACs detected at autopsy. The differences in sauna deaths between the I and NI groups may have implications for the targeted prevention of sauna deaths associated with alcohol consumption.
