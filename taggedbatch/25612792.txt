 The burden on healthcare services in the world has increased substantially in the past decades. The quality and quantity of care have to increase to meet surging demands , especially among patients with chronic<symptom> heart diseases. The expansion of information and communication technologies has led to new models for the delivery healthcare services in telemedicine. Therefore , mHealth plays an imperative role in the sustainable delivery of healthcare services in telemedicine. This paper presents a comprehensive review of healthcare service provision. It highlights the open issues and challenges related to the use of the real-time fault-tolerant mHealth system in telemedicine. The methodological aspects of mHealth are examined , and three distinct and successive phases are presented. The first discusses the identification process for establishing a decision matrix based on a crossover of ` time of arrival of patient at the hospital/multi-services ' and ` hospitals ' within mHealth. The second phase discusses the development of a decision matrix for hospital selection based on the MAHP method. The third phase discusses the validation of the proposed system.
