 Serotonin has widespread , but computationally obscure , modulatory effects on learning and cognition. Here , we studied the impact of optogenetic stimulation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons in mice performing a non-stationary , reward-driven decision-making task. Animals showed two distinct choice strategies. Choices after short inter-trial-intervals ( ITIs) depended only on the last trial outcome and followed a win-stay-lose-switch pattern. In contrast , choices after long ITIs reflected outcome history over multiple trials , as described by reinforcement learning models. We found that optogenetic stimulation during a trial significantly boosted the rate of learning that occurred due to the outcome of that trial , but these effects were only exhibited on choices after long ITIs. This suggests that serotonin neurons modulate reinforcement learning rates , and that this influence is masked by alternate , unaffected , decision mechanisms. These results provide insight into the role of serotonin in treating psychiatric disorders , particularly its modulation of neural plasticity and learning.
