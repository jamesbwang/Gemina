 In this study , a green space classification system for urban fringes was established based on multisource land use data from Ganjingzi District , China ( 2000-2015). The purpose of this study was to explore the spatiotemporal variation of green space landscapes and ecosystem service values ( ESV). During 2006-2015 , as urbanization advanced rapidly , the green space area decreased significantly ( 359.57 to 213.46 km
