 Biomaterials can interact with cells directly , that is , by direct contact of the cells with the material surface , or indirectly , through soluble species that can be released to or uptaken from the surrounding fluids. However , it is difficult to characterise the relevance of this fluid-mediated interaction separately from the topography and composition of the substrate , because they are coupled variables. These fluid-mediated interactions are amplified in the case of highly reactive CaPs such as biomimetic calcium deficient hydroxyapatite ( CDHA) , particularly in static in vitro cultures. The present work proposes a strategy to decouple the effect of ion exchange from topographical features by adjusting the volume ratio between the cell culture medium and biomaterial ( V Fluid mediated interactions play a significant role in the bioactivity of calcium phosphates. Ionic exchange is amplified in the case of biomimetic hydroxyapatite , which makes the in vitro characterisation of cell-material interactions especially challenging. The present work proposes a novel and simple strategy to explore the mechanisms of interaction of biomimetic and sintered calcium phosphates with mesenchymal stem cells. The effects of topography and ion exchange are analysed separately by modifying the volume ratio between cell culture medium and biomaterial. High ionic fluctuations interfered in the maturation of focal adhesions , hampering cell adhesion and leading to increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation rate.
