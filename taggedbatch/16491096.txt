 The aim of the present study is to investigate probable acute effects of vitamin D on ischemia-reperfusion injury in the rat ovary. A group of 30 Wistar albino rats was divided into five groups of 6 each. Group 1: underwent laparotomy only and the ovaries were removed. Group 2: 3-hr ischemia followed by excision of the ovaries. Group 3: 3-hr ischemia and 3-hr reperfusion and the ovaries were removed. Group 4: vitamin D was administered 30 min prior to the 3-hr of ischemia and the ovaries were excised at the end of ischemia period. Group 5: vitamin D was administered 30 min prior to the 3-hr of ischemia and 3-hr reperfusion then the ovaries were removed at the end of reperfusion. The ovaries excised in each group also underwent biochemical and histopathologic analysis. MDA ( malondialdehyde) , SOD ( superoxide dismutase) , NO ( nitric oxide) , TAS ( total antioxidant score) , TOS ( total oxidant score) were analyzed as biochemical parameters. There were no significant differences between groups in TAS , TOS , or OSI ( Vitamin D seems an effective molecule for protection of ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat ovary. There is some significant improvement in oxidative damages with vitamin D treatment.
