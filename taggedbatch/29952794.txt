: The current article reviews economic aspects of selected HIV/noncommunicable disease ( NCD) service delivery integration programs to assess the efficiency of integration in limited capacity settings. We define economies of scope and scale and their relevance to HIV/NCD integration. We summarize the results of a systematic review of cost and cost-effectiveness studies of integrated care , which identified 12 datasets ( nine studies) with a wide range of findings driven by differences in research questions , study methods , and health conditions measured. All studies were done in Africa and examined screening interventions only. No studies assessed the cost of integrated , long-term disease management. Few studies estimated the cost-effectiveness of integrated screening programs. The additional cost of integrating NCD screening with HIV<pathogen> care platforms represented a 6-30 % increase in the total costs of the programs for noncancer NCDs , with cervical cancer screening costs dependent on screening strategy. We conducted 11 key informant interviews to uncover perceptions of the economics of HIV/NCD integration. None of the informants had hard information about the economic efficiency of integration. Most expected integrated care to be more cost-effective than current practice , though a minority thought that greater specialization could be more cost-effective. In the final section of this article , we summarize research needs and propose a ` minimum economic dataset ' for future studies. We conclude that , although integrated HIV/NCD care has many benefits , the economic justification is unproven. Better information on the cost , cost-effectiveness , and fiscal sustainability of integrated programs is needed to justify this approach in limited-resource countries.
