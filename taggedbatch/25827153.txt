 To evaluate local recurrence ( LR) in women with early breast cancer ( BC) who underwent intraoperative radiation therapy with electrons particles ( IORT-E) or adjuvant hypofractionated external radiotherapy ( HYPOFX). We retrospectively analyzed 470 patients with early BC treated at our center from September 2009 to December 2012. 235 women were treated with breast-conserving surgery and immediate IORT-E ( 21 Gy/1 fraction) while 235 patients underwent wide excision followed by hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation. Radiotherapy modality was chosen according to an individualized decision based on tumor features , stage , technical feasibility , age , and acceptance to be enrolled in the IORT-E group. After a median follow-up of 6 years , we observed 8 ( 3.4 %) and 1 ( 0.42 %) LR in the IORT-E and in the HYPOFX group ( Our comparison showed that IORT-E and HYPOFX are two effective radiotherapy modalities after conservative surgery in early BC. However , at 6 years a significant higher rate of LR occurred in patients submitted to IORT-E with respect to HYPOFX. This finding may be correlated to some subsets of patients who , depending on the biological characteristics of the BC , may be less suitable to IORT-E.
