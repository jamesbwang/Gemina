 A subclinical cardiac perforation by a device cup of the Micra<pathogen> â„¢ transcatheter pacing system was suspected in a 78-year-old woman. During the procedure , the device cup was placed on the septum. The contrast media was injected before device deployment and remained outside of the myocardium. Later , a cardiac computed tomography scan visualized a protruded diverticular structure on the right ventricle. The contrast material remained in a pouch within the pericardium. To ensure the device is oriented away from the border between the right ventricular septum and the free wall , right anterior oblique view should be carefully reviewed before deployment.
