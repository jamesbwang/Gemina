 Schyzocotyle acheilognathi is a tapeworm cestode commonly found in native freshwater fishes from Asia. This cestode has low host specificity and for that reason it has been registered parasitizing more than 200 cultured and wild fish species , besides amphibians , reptiles and birds from different regions of the world. With a high pathogenic potential , S. acheilognathi may cause mortalities in highly infected fish. In South America , Schyzocotyle was reported in Cyprinus carpio from a Brazilian fish farm at the municipality of Cornélio Procópio , northern Paraná State and from the natural environment in C. carpio from Neuquen River , Patagonia , Argentina. So far , there has been no report of this parasite in South American native fishes. Herein we report the first occurrence of the invasive tapeworm S. acheilognathi in Rineloricaria pentamaculata ( Siluriformes , Loricariidae) , a native armored freshwater catfish from southern Brazil.
