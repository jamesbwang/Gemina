 To assess posterior inflammation<symptom> using a fluorescein ( FA)/ indocyanine-green angiography ( ICGA) scoring system , and compare them to the presently recommended outcome measure , the standardization of uveitis nomenclature vitreous haze score ( SUN-VH) in stromal choroiditis. This was a retrospective study on patients with a diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis ( OS) , ocular tuberculosis<disease> ( OT) , Birdshot retinochoroiditis ( BRC) and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease ( VKH) seen in the Centre for Ophthalmic Specialized Care , Lausanne , Switzerland. Angiography signs were quantified according to an established FA/ICGA scoring system. Vitritis was assessed using SUN-VH. Results were compared. 65 newly diagnosed patients ( 128 eyes) with stromal choroiditis were included. Angiographic scoring showed variable degrees of choroidal versus retinal involvement ( 87 % for OS , 72 % for OT , 62.5 % for BRC and 100 % for VKH). On the other hand , a mere 22 of 128 eyes ( 17 %) showed a SUN-VH score â‰¥ 2 necessary for inclusion in clinical trials. Moreover , FA/ICGA values followed a normal distribution curve and presented inter-examiner variations greater than 1-SD in only 8.4 % of cases. SUN-VH values ' distribution was non-normal and showed inter-examiner discrepancies greater than 1-SD in 51.7 % of cases. This study highlights the precise measurement of global posterior inflammation<symptom> achieved by a dual FA/ICGA scoring system in stromal choroiditis. In contrast , SUN-VH scale appears imprecise and inadequate , as only a minute percentage of the studied eyes could have been included in a clinical trial based on this criterion. To evaluate posterior intraocular inflammation<symptom> meaningfully in stromal choroiditis , the use of dual FA/ICGA is strongly advised and should replace the presently recommended SUN-VH system.
