 Deep brain stimulation ( DBS) has shown wide clinical applications for treating various disorders of central nervous system. High frequency stimulation ( HFS) of pulses with a constant intensity and a constant frequency is typically used in DBS. However , new stimulation paradigms with time-varying parameters provide a prospective direction for DBS developments. To meet the research demands for time-varying stimulations , we designed a new stimulation system with a technique of LabVIEW-based virtual instrument. The system included a LabVIEW program , a NI data acquisition card , and an analog stimulus isolator. The output waveforms of the system were measured to verify the time-varying parameters. Preliminary animal experiments were run by delivering the HFS sequences with time-varying parameters to the hippocampal CA1 region of anesthetized rats. Verification results showed that the stimulation system was able to generate pulse sequences with ramped intensity and hyperbolic frequency accurately. Application of the time-varying HFS sequences to the axons of pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region resulted in neuronal responses different from those induced by HFS with constant parameters. The results indicated important modulations of time-varying stimulations to the neuronal activity that could prevent the stimulation from inducing over-synchronized firing of population neurons. The stimulation system provides a useful technique for investigating diverse stimulation paradigms for the development of new DBS treatments.
