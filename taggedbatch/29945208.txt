 Ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) is an independent risk factor of colorectal cancer ( CRC). Both genetic and epigentic events induce a unique molecular profile during the development from UC to UC-related CRC ( UCRC). These molecular changes play varied roles in DNA repair , immune response , cell metabolism , and interaction with the microbiota during the carcinogenesis process. This review will systmatically discuss the molecular characteristics of UCRC and point out the future perspectives in this research field.
