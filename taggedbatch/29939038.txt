 In the 1960s at Stanford University 's Bing Preschool , children were given the option of taking an immediate , smaller reward or receiving a delayed , larger reward by waiting until the experimenter returned. Since then , the `` Marshmallow Test '' has been used in numerous studies to assess delay of gratification. Yet , no prior study has compared the performance of children across the decades. Common wisdom suggests children today would wait less long , preferring immediate gratification. Study 1 confirmed this intuition in a survey of adults in the United States ( N = 354; Mdn age = 34 years). To test the validity of this prediction , Study 2 analyzed the original data for average delay-of-gratification times ( out of 10 min) of 840 typically developing U.S. children in three birth cohorts from similar middle-high socioeconomic backgrounds in the late 1960s , 1980s , and 2000s , matched on age ( 3 to 5 years) at the time of testing. In contrast to popular belief , results revealed a linear increase in delay over time ( p < .0001 , Î·p2 = .047) , such that children in the 2000s waited on average 2 min longer than children in the 1960s , and 1 min longer than children in the 1980s. This pattern was robust with respect to age , sex , geography and sampling effects. We posit that increases in symbolic thought , technology , preschool education , and public attention to executive function skills have contributed to this finding , but caution that more research in diverse populations is needed to examine the generality of the findings and to identify causal factors.
