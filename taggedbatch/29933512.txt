 The protein kinase D ( PKD) family is regulated through multi-site phosphorylation , including autophosphorylation. For example , PKD displays in vivo autophosphorylation on Ser-742 ( and Ser-738 in vitro) in the activation loop and Ser-910 in the C-tail ( hPKD1 numbering). In this paper , we describe the surprising observation that PKD also displays in vitro autocatalytic activity towards a Tyr residue in the P + 1 loop of the activation segment. We define the molecular determinants for this unusual activity and identify a Cys residue ( C705 in PKD1) in the catalytic loop as of utmost importance. In cells , PKD Tyr autophosphorylation is suppressed through the association of an inhibitory factor. Our findings provide important novel insights into PKD ( auto) regulation.
