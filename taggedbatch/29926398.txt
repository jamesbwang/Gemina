 This study adopted a novel approach to relating nonhuman and human studies of anxiety<symptom> and latent inhibition , by exploring the degree to which rats ' `` temperaments '' in relation to anxiety<symptom> predicted the development of latent inhibition. It investigated whether anxiety<symptom> levels in one situation ( i.e. , an elevated-plus maze) involving 38 intact , mature rats , could predict performance on a latent inhibition task ( i.e. , an animal model of attention) , and , thus , reproduce findings from human studies. Rats were subjected to two tasks: a novel within-subject , appetitive stimulus pre-exposure procedure , and an elevated-plus maze task. In the stimulus pre-exposure task , non-reinforced exposure to a light led to facilitation of conditioning ( perceptual learning) during the first 3 days , and to retardation of conditioning ( latent inhibition) during the last 5 days. In the elevated-plus maze task , moderate levels of anxiety<symptom> were observed. Regression analyses revealed that anxiety<symptom> levels ( plus maze) were a significant predictor of latent inhibition ( stimulus pre-exposure). Measures of locomotor activity did not predict performance on the latent inhibition task. Rats with moderate levels of anxiety<symptom> had better performance in the late inhibition task than animals with low levels of anxiety<symptom>. These data and the methodology have implications for understanding nonhuman models of schizophrenia , and for the design of studies investigating these issues with nonhumans.
