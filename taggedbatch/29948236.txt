 Real-time monitoring is important for the safety and effectiveness of high-intensity focused ultrasound ( HIFU) therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred imaging modality for HIFU monitoring , with its unique capability of temperature imaging. For real-time temperature imaging , higher temporal resolution and larger spatial coverage are needed. In this study , a sequence based on the echo-shifted RF-spoiled gradient echo ( GRE) with simultaneous multi-slice ( SMS) imaging was designed for fast temperature imaging. A phantom experiment was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the echo-shifted sequence using a fluorescent fiber thermometer as reference. The temperature uncertainty of the echo-shifted sequence was compared with the traditional GRE sequence at room temperature through the ex vivo porcine muscle. Finally , the ex vivo porcine liver tissue experiment using HIFU heating was performed to demonstrate that the spatial coverage was increased without decreasing temporal resolution. The echo-shifted sequence had a better temperature uncertainty performance compared with the traditional GRE sequence with the same temporal resolution. The ex vivo heating experiment confirmed that by combining the SMS technique and echo-shifted sequence , the spatial coverage was increased without decreasing the temporal resolution while maintaining high temperature measurement precision. The proposed technique was validated as an effective real-time method for monitoring HIFU therapy.
