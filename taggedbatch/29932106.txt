 Porous high-N Ni-free austenitic stainless steel was fabricated by a powder metallurgical route. The microstructure and properties of the prepared porous austenitic stainless steel were studied. Results reveal that the duplex stainless steel transforms into austenitic stainless steel after nitridation sintering for 2 h. The prepared high-N stainless steel consists of & gamma;- Fe matrix and FCC structured CrN. Worm-shaped and granular-shaped CrN precipitates were observed in the prepared materials. The orientation relationship between CrN and austenite matrix is ( 011)
