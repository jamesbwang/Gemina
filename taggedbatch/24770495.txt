 Leprosy<disease> can be classified according to its operational form as paucibacillary or multibacillary. Bacilloscopy integrates its diagnostic armamentarium. Patients with the disease may present leprosy<disease> reactions. This study describes the association of bacilloscopy results and the type of operational classification of leprosy<disease> in patients with leprosy<disease> reactions. Medical records were analyzed at a reference center between 2010 and 2015. Reactions occurred in almost half of the patients , making their identification important. The bacilloscopic and operational characterization indicates a greater occurrence of leprosy<disease> reactions in patients with positive bacilloscopy and also in multibacillary.
