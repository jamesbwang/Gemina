 To determine the fat content of myxoid liposarcomas ( MLS) on MRI and to identify any association between lipid content and survival. The fat percentage of MLS diagnosed between January 2006 and December 2016 at a single institution was assessed by two radiologists on preoperative MR images. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine any association between tumor fat percentage and survival time. Tumor fat percentage was the single predictor in the model. A significance level of 0.05 was used. The Kaplan-Meier estimator was also used to provide a nonparametric estimate of the survivor function within the entire sample and within two patient subgroups consists of lipid-rich and lipid-poor tumors. Lipid-rich tumors were defined as any tumors showing more than 20 % of fat on MRI. A 20 % cutoff was determined arbitrarily. Of the 43 cases identified through retrospective review , 8 tumors demonstrated ≥ 10 % fat on MRI , and 4 tumors demonstrated ≥ 20 % fat ( highest fat percentage , 38 %). There was no significant survival difference between patients with high tumor fat , which was defined as ≥ 20 % fat , compared with those with little to no tumor fat. Myxoid liposarcomas may demonstrate a higher fat content on MRI than has previously been reported in the literature. Increased tumor fat percentage in lipid-rich tumors was not found to be associated with increased risk of death. Radiologists must be aware of the existence of MLS lesions<symptom> with higher fat content.
