 People of all ages can suffer from Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura ( HSP) , but it is the most common vasculitis in childhood. The most important involving gene is located on chromosome 6p21 .3 , a region coding for human leukocyte antigens ( HLAs). Among HLA genes , because of the high rate of polymorphisms , HLA-DRB1 is estimated to have a strong association with HSP. In this study , we aimed to assess the association of HLA-DRB1 alleles with HSP in Iranian children. This study consisted of thirty Iranian children with HSP and 35 healthy controls. Genomic DNA was extracted , and HLA typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers technique. The results have shown that HLA-DRB1 * 01 and HLA-DRB1 * 11 ( According to these results , there is an association between HLA-DRB1 * 01 and HLA-DRB1 * 11 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to HSP in our study group.
