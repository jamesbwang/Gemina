 An 8-month-old American Bulldog was presented for assessment of bilateral thoracic limb<symptom> lameness<symptom>. Computed tomographic imaging revealed large , deep osteochondritis dissecans lesions<symptom> in both humeral heads. The osteochondritis dissecans lesions<symptom> were debrided and the exposed subchondral defects were prepared to receive synthetic grafts. Circular implants consisting of a surface layer of polycarbonate urethane and a deep layer of lattice-type titanium were implanted into the osteochondral defects to reconstruct the articular surface topography. Follow-up clinical examination 1.5 , 3 and 9 months postoperatively revealed a lack of signs of shoulder pain and resolution of thoracic limb<symptom> lameness<symptom>. Nine-month follow-up radiographs showed radiographic evidence of osteointegration of both implants. Synthetic osteochondral implantation in the caudocentral aspect of the humeral head appeared technically feasible and effective in resolving lameness<symptom> caused by humeral head osteochondritis dissecans.
