 The presence of alginate-overproducing ( Alg Previously , a mutant with a second-site suppressor of alginate production ( sap) , sap27 , was isolated from the constitutively Alg LptD plays a specific role in alginate production. Our findings suggest that there are two pathways for the production of alginate in P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , one involving AlgW in the wild-type , and one involving AlgO in the mucA22 mutant.
