 GCMO NSs were synthesized by the reaction of metal nitrate salts in the presence of stabilizing agent and PG , by a Pechini method. Citric acid , maleic acid , succinic acid and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid were used as stabilizing agents. The structure , morphology , optical , magnetic and photocatalytic properties of the GCMO NSs were investigated using various characterization techniques. Effects of type of stabilizing agent , the molar ratio of stabilizing agent: PG and also calcination temperature on particle size and morphology of the products were investigated. Also the influence of kind of pollutant on photocatalytic behavior of GCMO NSs was evaluated.
