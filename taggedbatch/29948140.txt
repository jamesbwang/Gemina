 This study reviews the clinical features , subtypes , and outcomes of childhood Guillain-Barré syndrome<disease><symptom> ( GBS). Fifty-four children who attended a tertiary care training and research hospital in Turkey were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 6.5 ± 4.2 years and 32 patients ( 59.5 %) were male. The most common subtype of GBS was acute<symptom> inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ( AIDP) , which was seen in 27 patients ( 50 %). Having antecedent history , especially upper respiratory<disease><symptom> tract<symptom><disease> infection<disease> was significantly more common in AIDP ( P = 0.028). Sensorial symptoms were significantly more frequent in axonal type GBS ( P = 0.001). When we compare the demyelinating and axonal forms , all of the groups had favorable outcome. The diagnosis of pediatric GBS can be delayed because of its variable presentation. Early admission to hospital and early treatment are important for decreasing the need for respiratory support and improving the outcome.
