 The approach to lower gastrointestinal bleeding ( LGIB) has evolved over the last few years to incorporate a multidisciplinary management strategy. Although the causes of LGIB vary depending on the age and comorbid conditions of patients , the initial resuscitation and principles of optimizing patients ' condition before endoscopic evaluation , when appropriate , are the cornerstones to clinical care. The role of risk stratification is to triage patients as well as to mobilize health care resources based on predicted outcomes. Individualized management according to patients ' comorbid conditions has been a focus in most recent guidelines.
