 We used sector analysis to study cambium development and dynamics and to test if fundamental developmental and functional differences exist between cambial initials as true ` stem cells ' and more differentiated mother cells. In many higher plants , a cylindrical lateral meristem , the vascular cambium , forms along the plant axis. Most notably in stems of perennial tree species , this meristem gives rise to xylem ( wood) towards the inside of the trunk and phloem ( bark) towards the outside. As such , the vascular cambium is responsible for the production of most of the planet 's forest<disease> biomass , significantly contributing to the global carbon cycle. Using the bacterial uid A reporter gene in Agrobacterium-based in vivo stem transformation experiments in poplar trees we created 379 cambium sectors that originated from the transformation of individual cells. Results from our analysis of sector frequency and patterns are consistent with the poplar cambium featuring a single layer of true cambial initials ( being able to divide both anti- and periclinally). We show that initials are frequently lost from the cambium , that such cell loss rarely occurs at mother cell level , that phloem and xylem differentiation are controlled independently , and that the frequency of mother cell replenishment is not predetermined.
