 C5a receptor antagonist PMX205 is a synthetic hexapeptide capable of blocking C5a-C5a receptor ( C5aR) axis by simulating C5a active C-terminal amino acid residues. This hexapeptide presents good anti-inflammatory effects in a series of inflammation<symptom> models. The anti-inflammatory effect of PMX205 on periodontitis<disease> is yet to be fully fathomed. To examine the anti-inflammatory effects of PMX205 on RAW264 .7 mouse macrophages exposed to gingipain extracts and Porphyromonas<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> ( P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen>). MTT assay was carried out so as to specify the cytotoxicity of PMX205. RAW264 .7 cells were co-cultured in vitro with gingipain extracts or P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> to simulate the periodontitis<disease> inflammatory milieu. Real-time quantitative PCR , ELISA and Griess assay were performed in order to detect tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) , IL-6 , IL-23 , nitric oxide ( NO) , IL-10 , transforming growth factor-β1 ( TGF-β1) , andarginase-1 ( Arg-1). Furthermore , phagocytosis assay was done to evaluate the phagocytic capacity of RAW 264.7 cells. Finally , western blot analysis was conducted to evaluate myeloid differentiation factor 88 ( MyD88). PMX205 increased the expression levels of bacteriostatic substances ( NO and IL-23) and anti-inflammatory cytokines ( TGF-β1 , IL-10 and Arg-1); however , it reduced the expression levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 once RAW 264.7 macrophages were stimulated via gingipain extracts or P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen>. In addition , PMX205 promoted the macrophage phagocytosis and down-regulated protein expression of MyD88. PMX205 has recognizable anti-inflammatory effects in RAW 264.7 cell inflammation<symptom> model , a finding which probably opens doors to future investigations on new targets for the prevention and treatment of chronic periodontitis<disease>.
