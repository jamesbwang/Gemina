 A donor-acceptor based conjugated microporous polymer , PER@NiP-CMOP-1 , has been synthesized which can achieve highly sensitive stereo-specific `` Turn ON '' biosensing of an aminoglycoside up to the ppb level. The coordination-driven inhibition of photo-induced electron transfer ( d-PET) for d-electrons and the rotational freezing are the key factors for the recovery of the emission.
