 Digital templating is considered a standard for total hip arthroplasty. Different means for the necessary calibration of radiographs are known. While single marker calibration with radiopaque spheres is the most common , it is associated with possible significant deviations from the true magnification of the hip. Notably , fixed magnification factors showed better results. Therefore , a dual-position calibration marker method was simulated and compared to the established methods. First , an empirical fixed magnification factor was identified and applied to a series of radiographs. Second , three magnification factors were generated based on sagittal patient data of 398 CT scans. These methods were compared to the fixed factor. The fixed factor was 122.6 %. In the clinical application , the error of the fixed factor was 2.5 % while the error of the single marker was 5.2 %. In the CT cohort , the mean reference factor was 120.5 % in females and 120.3 % in males. The reference factor was compared to sex-specific means , sex-specific linear functions , and sex-specific cubic functions. The best results were found for the linear regression model with a mean difference of 0.8 % from the reference value. No proportional bias was found ( p = 0.623). The simulation of the dual-position marker method using the linear regression model showed promising results , superior to all other methods. In future studies , its clinical application should be tested.
