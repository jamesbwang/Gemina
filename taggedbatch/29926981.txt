 Genetic analysis detected excessive mono-allelic recessive GJB2 mutations in individuals with idiopathic deafness; the remaining alleles in trans/cis are underdetermined. The aim of this study was to assess the contributions of variants in GJB3 or GJB6 to non-syndromic sensorineural hearing impairment ( NSHI) in Chinese patients with mono-allelic GJB2 mutations. The entire coding sequences of GJB3/GJB6 , as well as deletions in GJB6 , in a cohort of NSHI patients ( n = 100) carrying likely pathogenic heterozygous GJB2 mutations , were tested. Targeted next generation sequencing was further performed in a multiplex family GDHY with moderate<symptom> to profound NSHI. Putatively causative GJB3 variant underlied 1 % ( 1/100) in this cohort. In family GDHY , we identified a rare GJB3 c. 250G > A mutation , as double heterozygotes with GJB2 c. 109G > A and/or a novel GJB2 mutation c. 638T > C predicted to be damaging in a digenic inheritance after precluding other attributable mutations from 127 deafness genes. No GJB6 mutation was found. GJB3/GJB6 variants account for a low proportion in autosomal recessive GJB2 mutation carriers in our cohort. Environmental causes , or other NSHI relevant genes , revealed by targeted next generation sequencing or whole exome sequencing , may play major roles in triggering deafness in these patients.
