 Unused medications ( UM) are an important issue , with the waste associated with UM a burden to the health-care system. The aims of this study were to clarify the amount and costs of UM in patients with advanced cancer at the time of their last admission to a palliative care unit and to explore the factors contributing to the cost of UM and how patients dealt with UM. A prospective observational study was conducted in single palliative care unit. Unused medications were classified into 6 categories and the number and cost of UM by category calculated per patient. Patients were classified into 2 cost groups ( high and low) based on the total cost of UM , and the number and cost of UM by category were compared between these 2 groups. Of 194 consecutive hospitalized patients , data were analyzed for 90. The mean number and cost of UM per patient was 440 and US$ 301 , respectively. Opioids accounted for 47 % of the cost of UM. Comparing costs by UM category , the proportion of opioids ( 51 % vs 21 %; P < .0001) and oral anticancer drugs ( 14 % vs 3 %; P = .02) was higher in the high- than in the low-cost group. Based on the results of the present study , the estimated annual waste cost of UM for patients with cancer who died in Japan was approximately US$ 110 million. Interventions to educate patients regarding UM and to eliminate barriers to opioid use may help reduce the cost of UM , particularly opioids and anticancer drugs.
