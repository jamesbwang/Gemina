 Technology is continuing to shape the way we collect health data , including data on alcohol use. A number of technologies are being developed to objectively measure intoxication ` in the wild ' without relying on self-report; the most immediate solution may be the use of personal breathalysers. In this study , we aimed to determine whether a cost-effective personal breathalyser would perform in a similar manner to a device used for roadside breath testing. We intercepted young adults ( Participants reported having consumed an average of 7.3 standard drinks before the interview and had a mean Blood Alcohol Content of 0.077 g/dl on the police-grade device and 0.085 g/dl on the personal device. Difference scores suggested the personal breathalyser was more likely to over report Blood Alcohol Content ( bias = 0.008 g/dl). Although the personal device was more likely to over report Blood Alcohol Content compared with the police-grade device , the results suggest that personal devices could be used as a measure of Blood Alcohol Content when collecting data outside of the lab.
