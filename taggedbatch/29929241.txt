 Organochlorine compounds ( OC) are of interest in current biomonitoring studies because of their well-known persistence , accumulation capacity and the adverse effects they caused in the past. P , p '- DDE has been shown to cause severe reproductive failures and population declines in birds of prey. However , there are knowledge gaps regarding OC exposure for some species ( e.g. harriers) , the historical record and the broader picture. The main goal was to evaluate exposure to p , p '- DDE and PCBs in two raptor species: Montagu 's and pallid harriers ( Circus pygargus and Circus macrourus) , and to investigate if birds from different breeding areas and wintering grounds differ in pollutant levels. For this purpose , we collected blood of adult and nestling Montagu 's and pallid harriers breeding in the natural steppes of Kazakhstan , and adult and nestling Montagu 's harriers breeding in agricultural and natural habitats of Spain , in 2007-2008. We determined the blood concentrations of p , p '- DDE and PCBs. Adult harriers generally showed higher concentrations of p , p '- DDE and PCBs than nestlings , probably because they had more time for a progressive accumulation of these compounds due to a higher intake than excretion rate. The p , p '- DDE concentrations in adults were equivalent in all the studied areas. The ratio p , p '- DDE/PCB 153 was higher in adults than in nestlings , suggesting that a portion of the p , p '- DDE in adult harriers may have come from p , p '- DDT applied in the past in the wintering areas. Overall , the concentrations of p , p '- DDE and âˆ‘ PCBs reported were generally low and below any demonstrated threshold of harm.
