 Chytrids are early diverging lineages of true fungi<pathogen> that reproduce with posteriorly uniflagellate zoospores. In aquatic ecosystems , parasitic chytrids of algae<pathogen> have important ecological roles by influencing the population dynamics of phytoplankton and transferring nutrients and energy from inedible algae<pathogen> to zooplankton via zoospores. Despite their ecological importance , information on parasitic chytrids is lacking in the current systematics of chytrids. Here , we investigated a novel chytrid culture KS100 that parasitizes the green alga , Microglena coccifera ( Volvocales). A cross-inoculation experiment revealed that KS100 infection was specific to the genus Microglena. Thallus morphology of KS100 is characterized by spherical or subspherical zoosporangium , which becomes slightly angular during zoospore discharge , 2-3 small and inoperculate pores from where zoospores are discharged , and rhizoids branching at the base that extends in a fan-like shape. This combination of characteristics was distinct from any other known chytrids. In molecular phylogeny , KS100 was placed in the order Rhizophydiales and was distinguished from any known families in the order. Zoospores of KS100 possessed a kinetosome-associated structure whose morphology and positioning were unique among the Rhizophydiales. Based on these results , we describe this chytrid as Collimyces mutans<pathogen> gen. et sp. nov. in the new family Collimycetaceae.
