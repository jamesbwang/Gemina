 Animal studies demonstrated that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists reduce myocardial necrosis<symptom> following regional ischaemia induction. This effect may improve cardiovascular outcomes after myocardial infarction. Risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> after myocardial infarction was evaluated in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk in the LEADER trial. Data from patients randomised to liraglutide or placebo , in addition to standard of care , in Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results ( LEADER) ( NCT01179048) were analysed post hoc. Cox regression , with myocardial infarction as a time-dependent covariate , was used to analyse time from randomisation to a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Patients who experienced myocardial infarction had a sevenfold higher risk of the composite endpoint ( with myocardial infarction: n = 148 , 25.0 %; without myocardial infarction: n = 716 , 8.2 %; hazard ratio: 7.0; 95 % confidence interval: 5.8 , 8.4). The risk of the composite endpoint after myocardial infarction was not significantly lower in the liraglutide group ( n = 63 , 23.0 %) compared with placebo ( n = 85 , 26.7 %; hazard ratio: 0.91; 95 % confidence interval: 0.66 , 1.26). The data demonstrated that having myocardial infarction significantly increased the risk of subsequent cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. However , we did not find evidence for a reduced risk in these cardiovascular outcomes following myocardial infarction in patients treated with liraglutide versus placebo.
