 Acute bacterial meningitis<disease><symptom> remains a life-threatening infectious<disease> disease<disease> with considerable morbidity and mortality. DNA-based detection methods are an urgent requisite for meningitis-causing bacterial pathogens for the prevention of outbreaks and control of infections. We proposed a novel PCR-mass spectrometry ( PCR-Mass) assay for the simultaneous detection of four meningitis-causing agents , Neisseria<pathogen> meningitidis<pathogen> , Streptococcus<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , Haemophilus<pathogen> influenzae<pathogen><disease> , and Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> in the present study. A total of 138 cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) samples ( including 56 CSF culture positive , 44 CSF culture negative , and 38 CSF control) were enrolled and analyzed by PCR/Mass. Results were compared to real-time PCR detection. These four targeting pathogens could be discriminated without cross-reaction by the accurate detection of the corresponding extension products with different masses. The limits of detection were 102 copies/reaction for S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , H.<pathogen> influenzae<pathogen><disease> , and N.<pathogen> meningitidis and 103 for M.<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen><disease>. The evaluation of the culture-positive CSF specimens from the meningitis<disease><symptom> patients provided an overall agreement rate of 85.7 % with PCR-Mass and real-time PCR. The PCR-Mass was also able to detect the targeting pathogens from culture-negative CSF specimens from meningitis<disease><symptom> patients receiving early antibiotic treatment. PCR-Mass could be used for the molecular detection of bacterial meningitis<disease><symptom> and tuberculosis<disease> , especially when early antibiotic treatment has been administered to the suspected patients.
