 To investigate the genetic polymorphism of 21 autosomal STR loci and Typing test of 2 000 unrelated individuals was performed using SiFaSTR ™ 23plex DNA ID system. The population genetic parameters of STR loci were statistically analysed. A total of 3 198 parentage confirmed cases were detected with that system and the mutation conditions were observed in 21 autosomal STR loci. All the 21 autosomal STR loci showed no significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium （ The involved STRs are highly polymorphic in Eastern<disease> Han population with acceptable mutation rates by the SiFaSTR ™ 23plex DNA ID system , which is suitable for paternity testing and individual identification.
