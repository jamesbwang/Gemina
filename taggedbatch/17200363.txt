 Indirubin , a constituent of the Chinese herbal medicine `` Qing-Dai , '' has anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activities. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of indirubin for ameliorating colonic inflammation<symptom> in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. Mice with dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS)- induced acute and chronic colitis<disease> were treated with indirubin in their diet. Clinical and histologic changes were evaluated. In addition , colon levels of interleukin-6 , a critical pro-inflammatory mediator , was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In the model of acute colitis<disease> , indirubin treatment improved the loss of body<symptom> weight. Histology of colonic tissue revealed that indirubin treatment improved the histology grading of colitis<disease> ( Our study clearly showed that oral intake of indirubin can improve murine DSS-induced colitis<disease> ( which mimics human inflammatory bowel disease).
