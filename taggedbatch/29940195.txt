 We study the spatial-temporal pattern of the spread of the 2009 H1N1<pathogen> influenza<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> using a metapopulation model linked by commuting flow based on the reported influenza<pathogen><disease> cases during the early stages of the epidemic in the Republic of Korea. The spatial heterogeneities , such as the local reproductive number and peak time , are investigated at province level. Furthermore , we discuss the effect of early intervention strategies , isolation and commuting restrictions , on the reduction of incidence at each province level. A major finding of this study is that early intervention at the source area of infection is more effective than interventions at the commuting-hub areas if the cost is limited.
