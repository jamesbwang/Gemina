 Compulsive exercise ( CE) has been the neglected `` Cinderella '' among eating disorder ( ED) symptoms , even though it seems to impact severity , treatment and outcome. This prompted a large-scale and systematic examination of the impact of CE in a representative ED sample. CE was examined in over 9000 female and male patients from a clinical ED database ( covering out-patient , day and/or residential treatment) with respect to prevalence , ED diagnosis , ED symptoms , clinical features , patient characteristics , and outcome at 1-year follow-up. Relationships between changes in CE behavior and remission were also examined. CE was a transdiagnostic symptom , present in nearly half of all patients ( 48 %). It was associated with greater overall ED pathology , particularly dietary restraint , and negative perfectionism. Initial CE did not impact remission rate , but patients continuing or starting CE during treatment had considerably lower remission rates compared to patients who never engaged in , or ceased with , CE. Results were comparable for females and males. At baseline , there were few differences between patients with and without CE , except a somewhat higher symptom load for patients with CE , and CE did not predict ED outcome. However , how CE developed during treatment to 1-year follow-up considerably impacted remission rates. We strongly recommend CE to be systematically assessed , addressed , and continuously evaluated in all ED patients seeking treatment.
