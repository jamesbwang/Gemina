 Tuberculosis<pathogen><disease> ( TB) research is a key component of the End TB Strategy. To track research output , we conducted a bibliometric analysis of TB research from the past decade. The Web of Science database was searched for publications from January 2007 to December 2016 with `` tuberculosis<disease> '' in the title. References were analysed using the R bibliometrix package. A year-stratified 5 % random subset was drawn to extract funding sources and identify research areas. The annual growth rate of publications was 7.3 % , and was highest ( 13.1 %) among Brazil , Russia , India , China and South Africa ( BRICS). The USA was the most productive country , with 18.4 % of references , followed by India ( 9.7 %) , China ( 7.3 %) , England ( 6.5 %) , and South Africa ( 3.9 %). In the subset analysis , the most common research area was ` fundamental research ' ( 33.8 %). Frequently acknowledged funders were US and EU-based , with China and India emerging as top funders. Collaborations appeared more frequently between high-income countries and low/medium income countries ( LMICs) , with fewer collaborations among LMICs. The past decade has seen a continued increase in TB publications. While USA continues to dominate research output and funding , BRICS countries have emerged as major research producers and funders. Collaborations among BRICS would enhance future TB research productivity.
