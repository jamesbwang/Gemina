 To systematically review the existing evidence of mobile health ( mHealth) tools for the treatment of eating disorders ( ED). Electronic databases ( Pubmed , PsycInfo , and SCOPUS) were searched , and PRISMA guidelines were followed. Selected studies were divided into three categories according to the intended purpose of the mHealth tools used: ( a) sole means of support , ( b) complementary to standard face-to-face treatment , and ( c) for relapse prevention. Additionally , studies were assessed on efficacy , qualitative information , and methodological quality. Fifteen studies were identified. Most studies using mHealth as a sole means of intervention or adjunct to traditional therapy showed no effects , although an improvement at postassessment was present in vodcast , smartphone application , and text-messaging interventions. Between group effects were only found for a text-messaging intervention for relapse prevention. Qualitative analyses showed that most mHealth interventions were considered as acceptable , supporting , and motivating by patients and therapists , although different important problems were observed in individual studies. Limited effects were found for mHealth interventions to reduce ED-related symptoms. A common evaluation framework for ED mHealth interventions should be proposed to assess the validity of interventions before implementing them on a larger scale in clinical practice.
