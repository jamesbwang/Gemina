 The discharge of inadequately treated or untreated industrial wastewaters has greatly contributed to the release of contaminants into the environment , including toxic metals. Toxic metals are persistent and bioaccumulative , being their removal from wastewaters prior to release into water bodies of great concern. Literature reports the use of brown marine macroalgae for toxic metals removal from aqueous solutions as an economic and eco-friendly technique , even when applied to diluted solutions. Minor attention has been given to the application of this technique in the treatment of real wastewaters , which present a complex composition that can compromise the biosorption performance. Therefore , the main goal of this comprehensive review is to critically outline studies that: ( i) applied brown marine macroalgae as natural cation exchanger for toxic metals removal from real and complex matrices; ( ii) optimised the biosorption process in a fixed-bed column , which was further scaled-up to pilot plants. An overview of toxic metals sources , chemistry and toxicity , which are relevant aspects to understand and develop treatment techniques , is initially presented. The problem of water resources pollution by toxic metals and more specifically the participation of metal finishing industries in the environmental contamination are issues also covered. The current and potential decontamination methods are presented including a discussion of their advantages and drawbacks. The literature on biosorption was reviewed in detail , considering especially the ion exchange properties of cell wall constituents , such as alginate and fucoidan , and their role in metal sequestration. Besides that , a detailed description of biosorption process design , especially in continuous mode , and the application of mechanistic models is addressed.
