 The aim was to estimate seroprevalence and prevalence of hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection in a small health area of the Valencian Community , Spain. This is a descriptive cross-sectional study aimed at estimation of HCV<pathogen> infection prevalence in the whole adult population ( 25-70 years old) , that is , a pilot study for an eventual population-based screening program. A total of 5849 participants aged 25-70 years ( 51 % male) were invited to participate by regular mail. Overall , 143 letters were returned owing to errors in the addresses. Of 5706 participants , 2637 ( 46.2 %) participated in the study. Rapid test of anti-HCV antibody detection was positive in 30 cases ( HCV<pathogen> seroprevalence 1.14 % , 95 % confidence intervals: 0.73-1.55 %). Of those , seven were not aware of their condition. Participants who had a positive result in the rapid test of anti-HCV detection were given a confirmatory test by enzyme immune assay , and all had a positive result. RNA-HCV determination by quantitative PCR in positive anti-HCV patients showed positive viremia in 13 ( 43.3 %) cases , of which five were not aware of the disease. Of the 17 patients who had negative viremia , two were unaware of their HCV<pathogen> status , one was a carrier of anti-HCV and was already aware of his condition , and 14 had been previously treated with satisfactory results. Regarding fibrosis<disease> , of the seven patients who were unaware of HCV<pathogen> infection , none of them had significant fibrosis<disease>. Moreover , 26 ( 86.7 %) anti-HCV positive patients were reported to have one or more risk factors for HCV<pathogen> infection. HCV<pathogen> screening strategies applied to the general population are good means to diagnose and treat patients who are not aware of their infection , avoiding new transmissions as well as disease progression.
