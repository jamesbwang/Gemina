 Four bacterial strains identified as members of the Acidovorax<pathogen> genus were isolated from two geographically distinct but similarly contaminated soils in North Carolina , USA , characterized , and their genomes sequenced. Their 16S rRNA genes were highly similar to those previously recovered during stable-isotope probing ( SIP) of one of the soils with the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH) phenanthrene. Heterotrophic growth of all strains occurred with a number of organic acids , as well as phenanthrene , but no other tested PAHs. Optimal growth occurred aerobically under mesophilic temperature , neutral pH , and low salinity conditions. Predominant fatty acids were C
