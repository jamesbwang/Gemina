 The mass-transfer properties of a core-shell packing material with 1.6 μm particle diameter , and that of a fully porous packing material with 1.7 μm particle diameter were investigated and compared. The first absolute and the second central moments of the peaks of the homologous series of alkylbenzenes , over a wide range of mobile phase velocities were measured and used for the calculation of the mass-transfer coefficients. For the evaluation of the band broadening caused by the thermal dissimilarities , the measurements were carried out under thermostated conditions and also at near adiabatic insulation of the columns.
