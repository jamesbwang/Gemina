 This study retrospectively evaluated the long-term results of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( NCRT) followed by esophagectomy for the patients with resectable , locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC). Altogether , 49 patients treated from 2008 to 2012 were analyzed. Chemotherapy consisted of 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. Radiotherapy was performed with a total dose of 40 Gy in 20 fractions for primary tumor , metastatic lymph nodes , and elective nodal area. Subsequently , transthoracic esophagectomy with extensive lymphadenectomy was performed. The median follow-up time for the survivors was 86 ( range , 55-111) months. Pathological complete response from NCRT was observed in 17 ( 35 %) patients. The 5-year overall survival and relapse-free survival rates were 56 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 43-71 %) and 55 % ( 95 % CI: 41-69 %) , respectively. The 5-year locoregional control rate was 84 % ( 95 % CI: 74-95 %). Multivariate analyses revealed body mass index , N-factor , and % Î”SUVmax as significant factors for overall survival. Recurrences and within-irradiation field failure were observed in 16 ( 31 %) and 4 ( 8 %) patients , respectively. Toxicities of NCRT were generally mild. Postoperative Grade IIIb<pathogen> or worse complications were seen in 14 % of patients , including one Grade V case ( 2 %). The 5-year incidence rate of late complications of Grade 3 or worse was 22 % ( 95 % CI: 7-36 %). The cumulative 5-year incidence rate of metachronous malignancies was 13 % ( 95 % CI: 1-26 %). NCRT followed by esophagectomy for patients with resectable , locally advanced ESCC showed favorable locoregional control and overall survival , with acceptable postoperative complications. Long-term careful follow-up for late complications and metachronous malignancies is needed.
