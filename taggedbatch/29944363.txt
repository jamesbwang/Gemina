 Density functional theory within the Kohn-Sham density functional theory ( KS-DFT) ansatz has been implemented into our bubbles and cube real-space molecular electronic structure framework , where functions containing steep cusps in the vicinity of the nuclei are expanded in atom-centered one-dimensional ( 1D) numerical grids multiplied with spherical harmonics ( bubbles). The remainder , i.e. , the cube , which is the cusp-free and smooth difference between the atomic one-center contributions and the exact molecular function , is represented on a three-dimensional ( 3D) equidistant grid by using a tractable number of grid points. The implementation of the methods is demonstrated by performing 3D numerical KS-DFT calculations on light atoms and small molecules. The accuracy is assessed by comparing the obtained energies with the best available reference energies.
