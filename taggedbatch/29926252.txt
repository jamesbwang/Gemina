 Despite Sweden 's good child health statistics , data on the mental health and wellbeing of Swedish preschool children is scarce and not routinely collected in healthcare. The study aimed to: identify the proportion of preschool children with mental health and somatic problems , the public sector services used by these children and whether they differ by type of problems , investigate whether other factors affect service use , and estimate the costs associated with these services. This study used cross-sectional data on a sample of 3175 children aged 3-5 from the `` Children and Parents in Focus trial ''. Data on service use , child health and demographics were obtained from primary caregivers. Child mental health was assessed by both primary caregivers and teachers. 8.9 % of the sample reported mental health problems , and approximately 1 % had comorbid somatic and mental health problems. Over 50 % of the preschoolers used any service , with school assistant being the most frequently used. The average annual cost per child , regardless of health status , was US$ 921 , with 75 % of the costs accruing at school. The presence of both somatic and mental health problems predicted higher service use , in particular extra services used at school and at home ( mean annual cost US$ 13826 and US$ 1583 , respectively). Children with comorbid problems accounted for the highest mean costs. Mental health problems among preschool children were particularly high compared to studies from other countries. There is a need to strengthen school mental health services to engage in proactive early identification of children with mental health problems so that appropriate care is provided. ISRCTN16513449.
