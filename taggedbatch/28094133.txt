 The purpose of this study was to determine the past-year prevalence estimates of cigarette smoking and eligibility for low-dose computed tomography ( LDCT) lung cancer screening among older U.S. adults and examine potential variations in these estimates by sexual orientation. Data were from the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions ( NESARC-III) and included in-person interviews with a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized adults aged 18 and older. Eligibility for LDCT was based on U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS) guidelines. Analyses included participants aged 55-77 ( n = 9,635). Overall , 17.5 % of older adult respondents reported past-year smoking. Overall rates of past-year cigarette smoking were influenced by sex and sexual orientation with males reporting higher rates compared to females. Among both males and females , smoking was most prevalent among bisexual individuals. Eligibility for LDCT was also higher among males compared to females and among bisexually identified adults relative to homosexual and heterosexual-identified adults. Overall , 11.2 % of older U.S. adults met eligibility for LDCT lung cancer screening. Eligibility for LDCT lung screening is associated with sexual orientation; the highest rates of eligibility are among bisexual women and men ( 26.9 and 24.5 % , respectively). The current study found variations in cigarette smoking and eligibility for LDCT lung cancer screening ( a proxy for chronic high-risk smoking) among older U.S. adults based on sexual orientation. Efforts to increase screening should take into account these differences.
