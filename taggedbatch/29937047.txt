 Cancer progression is the most relevant phase of carcinogenesis due to the development of malignant tumors in the host. Some viruses participate in malignant cell transformation , with recent compelling evidence suggesting that oncoviruses also have a role in cancer progression. The human hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) and C ( HCV<pathogen>) viruses<pathogen> , human papillomaviruses ( HPV) , Epstein-Barr<disease> virus ( EBV) , and Kaposi<disease> sarcoma<disease> herpesvirus<pathogen> ( KSHV) are the most important human oncoviruses currently known. Here , we discuss how oncoviruses can modulate cancer progression , such as tumor growth , invasion , and cancer metastasis.
