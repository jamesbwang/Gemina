 Research shows that humans spontaneously follow another individual 's gaze. However , little remains known on how they respond when multiple gaze cues diverge across members of a social group. To address this question , we presented participants with displays depicting three ( Experiment 1) or five ( Experiment 2) agents showing diverging social cues. In a three-person group , one individual looking at the target ( 33 % of the group) was sufficient to elicit gaze-facilitated target responses. With a five-person group , however , three individuals looking at the target ( 60 % of the group) were necessary to produce the same effect. Gaze following in small groups therefore appears to be based on a quorum-like principle , whereby the critical level of social information needed for gaze following is determined by a proportion of consistent social cues scaled as a function of group size. As group size grows , greater agreement is needed to evoke joint attention.
