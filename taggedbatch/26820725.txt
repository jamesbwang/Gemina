 Five in vitro experiments were conducted with the following objectives: 1) To evaluate the ruminal fermentation of three different single ingredients: corn , glycerin , and starch ( Exp. 1 and 2); 2) To assess effects of partially replacing corn with glycerin in beef cattle diets on ruminal fermentation pattern ( Exp. 3 and 4); and 3) To evaluate the effects of glycerin inclusion on the extension of ruminal DM digestibility of feeds with high ( orchard hay) and low ( corn) fiber content ( Exp. 5). For Exp. 1 and 2 , two in vitro systems ( 24-bottle AnkomRF and 20-serum bottles) were used in four consecutive fermentation batches to evaluate gas production ( GP) , fermentation profiles , enteric methane ( CH4) , and carbon dioxide ( CO2) of corn , glycerin , and starch. The 24 h total GP , acetate concentration , and acetate: propionate ratio decreased only when glycerin was added to the diet ( P < 0.01). The 48-h total GP and metabolizable energy were greatest for corn ( P < 0.01) , and similar between glycerin and starch. The starch treatment had the lowest total volatile fatty acids concentration ( P = 0.01). Glycerin had greatest CH4 production , lag time , and maximum gas volume of the first pool ( P < 0.05). However , the maximum gas volume of the second pool was greatest for corn ( P < 0.05) , and similar between glycerin and starch. The starch treatment had the greatest specific rates of digestion for first and second pools ( P < 0.05). Production of CO2 ( mL/g) was greater for corn ( P < 0.01) , but similar for glycerin and starch. For Exp. 3 and 4 , the same systems were used to evaluate four different levels of glycerin ( 0 , 100 , 200 , and 300 g/kg of dry matter ( DM)) replacing corn in beef cattle finishing diets. Glycerin levels did not affect 24 and 48 h total GP , CH4 , and CO2 ( P > 0.05). The inclusion of glycerin linearly decreased acetate concentration ( P = 0.03) and acetate: propionate ratio ( P = 0.04). For Exp. 5 , two DaisyII incubators were used to evaluate the in vitro dry matter digestibility ( IVDMD) of the following treatments: orchard hay; corn; orchard hay + glycerin; and corn + glycerin. Glycerin inclusion decreased orchard hay IVDMD ( P < 0.01) but did not affect corn IVDMD ( P > 0.05). We concluded that , under these experimental conditions , glycerin has similar energy efficiency when used in replacement of corn and included at up to 300 g/kg in beef cattle diets.
