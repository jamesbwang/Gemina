 Association mapping based on linkage disequilibrium provides a promising tool for dissecting the genetic basis underlying complex traits. To reveal the genetic variations of yield and yield components traits in upland cotton , 403 upland cotton accessions were collected and analyzed by 560 genome-wide simple sequence repeats ( SSRs). A diverse panel consisting of 403 upland cotton accessions was grown in six different environments , and the yield and yield component traits were measured , and 560 SSR markers covering the whole genome were mapped. Association studies were performed to uncover the genotypic and phenotypic variations using a mixed linear model. Favorable alleles and typical accessions for yield traits were identified. A total of 201 markers were polymorphic , revealing 394 alleles. The average gene diversity and polymorphism information content were 0.556 and 0.483 , respectively. Based on a population structure analysis , 403 accessions were divided into two subgroups. A mixed linear model analysis of the association mapping detected 43 marker loci according to the best linear unbiased prediction and in at least three of the six environments (- lgP > 1.30 , P < 0.05). Among the 43 associated markers , five were associated with more than two traits simultaneously and nine were coincident with those identified previously. Based on phenotypic effects , favorable alleles and typical accessions that contained the elite allele loci related to yield traits were identified and are widely used in practical breeding. This study detected favorable quantitative trait loci 's alleles and typical accessions for yield traits , these are excellent genetic resources for future high-yield breeding by marker-assisted selection in upland cotton in China.
