 Apigenin is a plant-derived compound belonging to the flavonoids category and bears protective effects on different cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of apigenin on the number of viable and apoptotic blastomeres , the zona pellucida ( ZP) thickness and hatching rate of pre-implantation mouse embryos exposed to H In this experimental study , 420 two-cell embryos were randomly divided into six groups: i. Control , ii. Apigenin , iii. H The results of viable and apoptotic blastomeres quantity , the ZP thickness , and the percentage of blastocysts and hatched blastocysts were significantly more favorable in the apigenin group , rather than the control group ( P < 0.05). The results of the apigenin + H The results suggest that apigenin may protect mouse embryos against H
