 Interferon regulatory factor 8 ( IRF8) is a critical transcription factor in innate immune responses that regulates the development and function of myeloid cells. Human periapical lesions<symptom> are caused by endodontic microbial infections. However , the presence of IRF8 in human periapical lesions<symptom> remains elusive. This study aims to explore the expression of IRF8 in human periapical lesions<symptom> and the possible association of IRF8 with macrophages , nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB) signaling , and the autophagy process. Thirty-nine human periapical tissues , including healthy control tissues ( n = 15) , radicular cysts<symptom> ( RCs , n = 11) , and periapical granulomas<disease> ( PG , n = 13) , were examined. Tissues were fixed in paraformaldehyde and analyzed. The inflammatory infiltrates of lesions<symptom> were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin , and the expression of IRF8 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Double immunofluorescence assessment was performed to colocalize IRF8 with CD68 , NF-κB p65 , and LC3B. The expression of IRF8 was significantly higher in RCs and PGs than in the healthy control group , but no significant difference was found between RCs and PGs. There were significantly more IRF8-CD68 double-positive cells in RCs and PGs than in the healthy control group , but no significant difference was observed between RCs and PGs. Double-labeling analysis of IRF8 with NF-κB and LC3B indicated that IRF8 expression is associated with NF-κB signaling and the autophagy process during periapical lesions<symptom>. IRF8 could be observed and might possibly be involved in macrophages in the development of periapical lesions<symptom>.
