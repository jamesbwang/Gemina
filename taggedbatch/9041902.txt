 ( Purpose) The aim of this study was to examine the changes in sternocleidomastoid<symptom> muscle ( SCM) activity when using a cervical support pillow ( CSP) and to determine the pillow 's effect on satisfaction in asymptomatic participants. ( Subjects and Methods) This study followed a cross-over design and the order of the measurements was counterbalanced. Twenty asymptomatic participants were positioned supine for 5 minutes by using either a CSP or a general pillow ( GP) while the activity of the SCM was measured using surface electromyography. ( Results) The CSP significantly decreased the activity of the SCM compared with the GP , and satisfaction after use of the CSP was significantly greater than that after use of the GP. ( Conclusion) This study suggests that the CSP may be effective in preventing unnecessary neck<symptom> muscle activation during sleep in asymptomatic people.
