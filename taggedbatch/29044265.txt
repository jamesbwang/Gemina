 Inflammation<symptom> is the principal response invoked by the body<symptom> to address injuries. Despite inflammation<symptom> constituting a crucial component of tissue repair , it is well known that unchecked or chronic inflammation<symptom> becomes deleterious , leading to progressive tissue damage. Studies over the past years focused on foods rich in polyphenols with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties , since inflammation<symptom> was recognized to play a central role in several diseases. In this review , we discuss the beneficial effects of resveratrol , the most widely investigated polyphenol , on cancer and neurodegenerative , respiratory , metabolic , and cardiovascular diseases. We highlight how resveratrol , despite its unfavorable pharmacokinetics , can modulate the inflammatory pathways underlying those diseases , and we identify future opportunities for the evaluation of its clinical feasibility.
