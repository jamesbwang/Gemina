 To evaluate the treatment of gingival recessions by semilunar coronally positioned flap plus enamel matrix derivative ( SCPF + EMD). Thirty patients with class I localized gingival recession were included. They were randomly allocated in two groups: SCPF + EMD and SCPF. Recession height ( RH) , recession width ( RW) , width of keratinized tissue ( WKT) , thickness of keratinized tissue ( TKT) , probing depth ( PD) , and clinical attachment level ( CAL) were measured at baseline , 6 and 12 months post-surgery. Patient/professional evaluation of esthetics and root sensitivity was performed. After 12 months , mean root coverage was 1.98 ± 0.33 mm for SCPF + EMD ( 90.86 ± 14.69 %) and 1.85 ± 0.41 mm ( 79.76 ± 17.44 %) for SCPF ( p > 0.05). The esthetic evaluation by the patient showed preference for SCPF + EMD. According to the professional evaluation ( QCE) , the use of EMD decreases the appearance of postoperative scar tissue line. There was a significant reduction in root hypersensitivity<disease> with no further complaints by the patients. The addition of EMD provides significantly better esthetics to SCPF , according to patient and professional assessments. SCPF + EMD is effective but not superior to SCPF for root coverage , after 12 months. Previous clinical trials showed that the combination of EMD with coronally advanced flaps may enhance the outcome of root coverage. There is a lack of studies testing the combination of EMD with SCPF. The combination SCPF + EMD provides better esthetics when compared to the SCPF and is effective , but not superior , to SCPF for root coverage , after 12 months. NCT02459704.
