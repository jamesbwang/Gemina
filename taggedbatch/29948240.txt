 Obstructive colorectal cancer ( CRC) is an emergency situation with high morbidity and mortality , but long-term outcomes of stage II/III obstructive CRC remain unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate prognostic factors , including colorectal obstruction. Data were retrospectively reviewed from consecutive patients with stage II/III CRC who underwent curative surgery between January 2007 and December 2011 at two Japanese institutions. We analyzed overall survival ( OS) and relapse-free survival ( RFS) , according to various prognostic factors including colorectal obstruction. In total , 979 patients with stage II/III CRC were identified for this study. Among these 979 patients , 94 patients showed colorectal obstruction ( 9.6 %). In both stage II and stage III CRCs , colorectal obstruction showed significantly poorer OS and RFS compared to non-obstruction ( 5-year OS , obstruction vs. non-obstruction , stage II: 65.9 vs. 86.5 % , P = 0.002; stage III: 55.9 vs. 73.6 % , P = 0.007) ( 5-year RFS , obstruction vs. non-obstruction , stage II: 59.2 vs. 77.8 % , P = 0.008; stage III 31.3 vs. 56.3 % , P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated colorectal obstruction as a significant independent and poor prognostic factor in terms of both OS ( hazard ratio ( HR) 2.469; 95 % CI 1.339-4.545; P = 0.004) and RFS ( HR 1.992; 95 % CI 1.160-3.425; P = 0.012) for stage II CRC , as well as pT4 stage. On multivariate analysis for stage III CRC , colorectal obstruction was a significant predictor of poor RFS ( HR 1.626; 95 % CI 1.070-2.469; P = 0.023) , but not poor OS. Colorectal obstruction is an independent poor prognostic factor for stage II CRC. Adjuvant chemotherapy might be feasible for stage II CRC with colorectal obstruction.
