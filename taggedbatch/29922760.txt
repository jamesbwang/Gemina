 In this observational study , we investigated whether specialized care improves outcomes for acute pancreatitis<disease> ( AP). Consecutive patients admitted to two university hospitals with AP were enrolled in this study between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016 ( Center A: specialized center; Center B: general hospital). Data on demographic characteristics and AP etiology , severity , mortality and quality of care ( enteral nutrition and antibiotic use) were extracted from the Hungarian Acute Pancreatitis<disease> Registry. An independent sample t-test , Mann-Whitney test , chi-squared test or Fisher 's test were used for statistical analyses. Costs of care were calculated and compared in the two models of care. There were 355 patients enrolled , 195 patients in the specialized center ( Center A) and 160 patients in the general hospital ( Center B). There was no difference in mean age ( 57.02 +/ -17.16 vs. 57.31 +/ -16.50 P = 0.872) and sex ratio ( 56 % males vs. 57 % males , P = 0.837) between centres , allowing a comparison without selection bias. Center A had lower mortality ( n = 2 , 1.03 % vs. n = 16 , 6.25 % , p = 0.007) , more patients received enteral feeding ( n = 179 , 91.8 % , vs. n = 36 , 22.5 % , p < 0.001) and fewer patients were treated with antibiotics ( n = 85 , 43.6 % vs. n = 123 , 76.9 % , p = 0.001). In Center A the median length of hospitalization was shorter ( Me 6 , IQR 5-9 vs. Me 8 , IQR 6-11 , p = 0.02) and the costs of care were by 25 % lower. Our data suggests that treatment of AP in specialized centers reduces mortality , length of hospitalization and thus might reduce the costs.
