 The aim of the present study was to identify genes with similar function to that of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs) in invasive lung adenocarcinoma ( AC) and to screen the transcription factors that regulate MMPs. The gene expression dataset GSE2514 , including 20 invasive lung AC samples and 19 adjacent normal lung samples , was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) were screened using the limma package in R. Genes with similar function to MMPs were identified by K-means clustering. Their correlations with MMPs were validated using Pearson correlation analysis. The expression of MMPs in lung cancer and normal tissues was evaluated by western blot analysis. Protein-protein interaction ( PPI) network and transcriptional regulatory network analyses were performed with Retrieval of Interacting Genes and Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery , respectively. As a result , 269 DEGs were identified between invasive lung AC samples and normal lung samples , including 78 upregulated and 191 downregulated genes. Four MMPs ( MMP1 , MMP7 , MMP9 and MMP12) , which were upregulated in lung AC , were clustered into one group with other genes , including NAD ( P) H quinone oxidoreductase 1 , claudin 3 ( CLDN3) , S100 calcium-binding protein P , serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 , collagen type XI α 1 chain , periostin and desmoplakin ( DSP) , following cluster analysis. Pearson correlation analysis further confirmed correlations between MMP9-CLDN3 , MMP9-DSP and MMP12-DSP. PPI network analysis also indicated multiple interactions between MMPs-associated genes. Furthermore , MMPs were commonly regulated by CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α transcription factor. These findings may provide further insight into the mechanisms of MMPs in invasive lung AC.
