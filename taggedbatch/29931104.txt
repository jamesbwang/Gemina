 A highly stereo-specific liquid chromatographic method was developed and validated for the quantification of enantiomeric impurity ( R-enantiomer) in novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent ( WCK 4086) , a drug substance. The separation was achieved on Chiralpak AD-H ( amylose-based chiral stationary phase) using a mobile phase consisting of n-hexane: 2-propanol: methanol: trifluoroacetic acid ( 80:10:10:0.4 , v/v/v/ v) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min-1. Chromatographic resolution between two enantiomers was found to be more than 2.0. Method was extensively validated for the quantification of R-enantiomer in WCK 4086 and proved to be robust. Method was found to be highly specific as all other related impurities were separated from the enantiomers. The calibration curve for R-enantiomer showed an excellent linearity over the concentration range of 1-5 μg mL-1. Limit of quantitation ( LOQ) and limit of detection ( LOD) for R-enantiomer were 0.009 μg and 0.003 μg , respectively. Average recovery of the R-enantiomer was in the range of 94.55-109.67 %. Analytical solutions were found to be stable up to 70 h at room temperature. Developed method was found to be specific , sensitive , precise and accurate for quantitative determination of R-enantiomer in WCK 4086 and useful for controlling the enantiomeric impurity in drug substance used for preclinical studies.
