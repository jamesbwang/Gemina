 Serious and often fatal acute kidney injury ( AKI) is frequently seen after major surgery , local and remote organ damage , and sepsis<disease>. It is associated with uncontrolled inflammation<symptom> , and is usually diagnosed only after the kidneys have gone through significant and often irreversible damage. During our work involving another type of kidney disease that leads to acid-base disorders of the blood , we unexpectedly found high levels of a protein called the P2Y14 `` purinergic '' receptor , in specialized kidney epithelial cells called intercalated cells ( ICs). These cells are responsible for maintaining whole body acid-base balance<symptom> by regulating the secretion of excess protons into the urine , which normalizes blood pH. However , it turns out that the P2Y14 receptor in these cells responds to a molecule called uridine diphosphate ( UDP)- glucose , which is a danger signal released by damaged cells anywhere in the body. When UDP-glucose reaches the kidney , it stimulates ICs to produce chemoattractant cytokines; this results in renal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> and contributes to the onset of AKI. Key Message: Thus , our work now points to ICs as key mediators of renal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> and AKI , following surgery and/or damage to remote organs , sepsis<disease> , and also local insults to the kidney itself. The link between the proton secreting ICs of the kidney and AKI is an example of how a fundamental research project with a defined aim , in this case understanding acid-base homeostasis , can lead to a novel observation that has unexpected but major implications in another area of human health.
