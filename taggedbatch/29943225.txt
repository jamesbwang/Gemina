 Since the spread of enhanced recovery programs , early withdrawal of the nasogastric tube ( NGT) is recommended after pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PD) , although few data on the safety of this practice are available. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the absence of nasogastric decompression after PD on postoperative outcome. All consecutive patients undergoing PD between January 2014 and December 2015 at a single center were retrospectively analyzed. Since May 2015 , all operated patients had the NGT removed immediately after the procedure ( NGT- group) and were compared to patients operated before this practice ( NGT + group) , who had the NGT maintained until at least postoperative day 3. During the study period , 139 patients underwent PD , of whom 40 ( 29 %) were in the NGT- group and 99 ( 71 %) were in the NGT + group. The length of hospital stay ( LOS) and rate of postoperative complications of grade 2 or higher according to the Clavien-Dindo grading system were significantly higher in the NGT + group ( 14 ( 11-25) vs. 10 ( 8-14.2) , P = 0.005 and 82.8 vs. 40 % , P < 0.001 , respectively). Incidence and severity of delayed gastric emptying ( DGE) grade B-C were also higher in the NGT + group ( 45.5 vs. 7.5 % , P < 0.001). There was no difference between the two groups concerning the 90-day postoperative mortality ( P = 0.18). The absence of systematic nasogastric decompression after PD might reduce postoperative complications , DGE , and LOS. These encouraging results deserve to be confirmed by a prospective randomized study ( NCT: 02594956).
