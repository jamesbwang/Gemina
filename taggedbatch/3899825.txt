 Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome<disease><symptom> ( OSAHS) is frequently present in patients with severe obesity , but its prevalence especially in women is not well defined. OSAHS and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are common conditions , frequently associated in patients with central obesity and metabolic syndrome<disease><symptom> and are both the result of the accumulation of ectopic fat mass. Identifying predictors of risk of OSAHS may be useful to select the subjects requiring instrumental sleep evaluation. In this cross-sectional study , we have investigated the potential role of hepatic left lobe volume ( HLLV) in predicting the presence of OSAHS. OSAHS was quantified by the apnea/hypopnea index ( AHI) and oxygen desaturation index in a cardiorespiratory inpatient sleep study of 97 obese women ( age: 47 ± 11 years body mass index ( BMI): 50 ± 8 kg/m
