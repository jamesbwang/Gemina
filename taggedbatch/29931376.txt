 Singapore has a rapidly ageing population and an increasing prevalence of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). Compliance to AD medications is associated with treatment effectiveness. We investigated compliance to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors ( AChEIs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA) receptor antagonist and treatment persistence among patients seen at the General Memory Clinic of National University Hospital , Singapore. We also identified the reasons for non-compliance. Patients seen at the General Memory Clinic between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2014 , who were prescribed AChEIs and NMDA receptor antagonist , were included in this retrospective cohort study. Non-compliance to medications was indirectly measured by failure to renew prescription within 60 days of the last day of medication supplied by the previous prescription. The reasons for non-compliance were identified. A total of 144 patients were included. At one year , 107 patients were compliant to AD medications , while 37 patients were non-compliant. Around 60 % of the non-compliant patients discontinued the use of AD medications within the first six months , and the mean persistent treatment period among this group of patients was 10.3 Â± 3.5 months. The main reason for non-compliance was patients ' and caregivers ' perception that memory<symptom> loss<symptom> was of lower priority than other co-existing illnesses. Other reasons for non-compliance included side effects of medications ( 18.9 %) , perceived ineffectiveness of treatment ( 16.2 %) , inability to attend clinic ( 5.4 %) and high cost of medications ( 2.7 %). Our findings suggest that the reasons for medication non-compliance can be identified early. Better compliance may be achieved through a multidisciplinary approach to patient education.
