 Criminological theories of crime , delinquency , and deviancy emphasize the causal role of low self-control whereas models of psychopathology posit a general trait liability , `` disinhibition '' , contributing to persistent antisocial behavior and substance use. The aim of the current work was to link these compatible perspectives on deviancy through reference to a biobehavioral conceptualization of disinhibition. We examined how the Grasmick et al. ( 1993) self-control scale , relates to ( a) trait disinhibition as indexed by self-report scales , performance on inhibitory-control tasks , and brain reactivity to cognitive stimuli , and ( b) a cross-domain index combining measures from these three domains. As expected , variation in self-control was robustly associated with antisocial deviance , substance use problems , and measures of disinhibition across measurement domains. Further , a factor analytic model provided compelling evidence that the Grasmick et al. scale operates as a robust indicator within a biobehavioral conceptualization of disinhibition. Findings confirm a strong link between self-control and trait disinhibition , and support the view that deficits in self-control have a prominent biobehavioral basis. Research in the areas of criminology and psychopathology can mutually benefit from a focus on influences contributing to variations in self-control , conceptualized as trait disinhibition.
