 Hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis ( HFTC) , secondary to fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23) gene mutation , is a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent calcified masses. We describe young Lebanese cousins presenting with HFTC , based on a retrospective chart review and a prospective case study. In addition , we present a comprehensive review on the topic , based on a literature search conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar , in 2014 and updated in December 2017. While the patients had the same previously reported FGF23 gene mutation ( homozygous c.G367T variant in exon 3 leading to a missense mutation) , they presented with variable severity and age of disease onset ( at 4 years in patient 1 and at 23 years in patient 2). A review of the literature revealed several potential patho-physiologic pathways of HFTC clinical manifestations , some of which may be independent of hyperphosphatemia. Most available treatment options aim at reducing serum phosphate level , by stimulating renal excretion or by inhibiting intestinal absorption. HFTC is a challenging disease. While the available medical treatment has a limited and inconsistent effect on disease symptomatology , surgical resection of calcified masses remains the last resort. Research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of FGF23 replacement or molecular therapy , targeting the specific genetic aberration. Hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent calcified masses , in addition to other visceral , skeletal , and vascular manifestations. It remains a very challenging disease.
