 Recent scientific literature shows that emotional cues conveyed by human vocalizations and odours are processed in an asymmetrical way by the canine brain. In the present study , during feeding behaviour , dogs were suddenly presented with 2-D stimuli depicting human faces expressing the Ekman 's six basic emotion ( e.g. anger , fear , happiness , sadness , surprise , disgust , and neutral) , simultaneously into the left and right visual hemifields. A bias to turn the head towards the left ( right hemisphere) rather than the right side was observed with human faces expressing anger , fear , and happiness emotions , but an opposite bias ( left hemisphere) was observed with human faces expressing surprise. Furthermore , dogs displayed higher behavioural and cardiac activity to picture of human faces expressing clear arousal emotional state. Overall , results demonstrated that dogs are sensitive to emotional cues conveyed by human faces , supporting the existence of an asymmetrical emotional modulation of the canine brain to process basic human emotions.
