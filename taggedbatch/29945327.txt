 Marchiafava-Bignami disease ( MBD) is a neurological degenerative disorder with a pathognomonic hallmark of symmetric demyelination in the corpus callosum ( CC). Most reported cases were chronic alcoholics and some showed cortical lesions<symptom> related to poor clinical prognosis. Herein we report a case of a chronic alcoholic who presented with confusion<symptom> and generalized weakness<symptom>. Nerve fiber integrity and metabolic changes were evaluated with Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) sequences including diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI) and MRS. MRI revealed the typical callosal lesions<symptom> of MBD with bilateral frontoparietal cortical lesions<symptom>. DTI and MRS showed both impaired myelin integrity and axonal density in the CC. The cortical lesions<symptom> partly disappeared after intravenous administration of high-dose multivitamins and corticosteroids. The patient regained consciousness<symptom> 3 months later while dysarthria<symptom> and quadriplegia persisted. Three years later , the patient can interact occasionally with people and the functional activities of both upper and lower limbs have no improvement. To our knowledge , this is the first report of DTI together with MRS assisting in evaluating the prognosis of MBD.
