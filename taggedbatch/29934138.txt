 Knowledge on the association between arterial stiffness and intracranial atherosclerosis is limited. Here , we aimed to assess whether the aortic pulse wave velocity ( PWV)- used as a surrogate of arterial stiffness-might independently predict severity of carotid siphon calcifications ( CSCs) , used as a marker of atherosclerosis. Of 437 Atahualpa residents aged 60 years or older , 300 ( 69 %) underwent head computed tomography ( CT) ( for CSC assessment) , brain magnetic resonance imaging ( for identification of neuroimaging signatures of cerebral small vessel disease ( SVD)) , and aortic PWV determinations ( for arterial stiffness estimation). Ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to predict severity of CSC ( as the dependent variable) according to levels of aortic PWV after adjusting for demographics , cardiovascular risk factors , and neuroimaging signatures of SVD. Grade 1 CSC were noticed in 120 ( 40 %) subjects , grade 2 in 84 ( 28 %) , grade 3 in 73 ( 24 %) , and grade 4 in 23 ( 8 %). The mean PWV was 10.4 ± 1.8 m/s , which increased from 9.8 ± 1.3 to 11.1 ± 2.1 m/s in individuals with grades 1 and 4 CSC , respectively ( P < .001). The most parsimonious ordinal logistic regression model adjusted for relevant confounders showed a significant association between aortic PWV and severity of CSC. In this model , a change of 1 unit of aortic PWV increased the odds of CSC severity by 1.22 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.07-1.39; P = .004). The monotonically increased odds of aortic PWV among subjects with different grades of CSC , suggest that aortic PWV may be a marker for identifying candidates for CT screening in the search of CSC.
