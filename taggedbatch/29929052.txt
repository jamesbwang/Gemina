 In magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) , the acquired images are usually not of high enough resolution due to constraints such as long sampling times and patient comfort. High-resolution MRI images can be obtained by super-resolution techniques , which can be grouped into two categories: single-contrast super-resolution and multi-contrast super-resolution , where the former has no reference information , and the latter applies a high-resolution image of another modality as a reference. In this paper , we propose a deep convolutional neural network model , which performs single- and multi-contrast super-resolution reconstructions simultaneously. Experimental results on synthetic and real brain MRI images show that our convolutional neural network model outperforms state-of-the-art MRI super-resolution methods in terms of visual quality and objective quality criteria such as peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity.
