 The presence of a peritoneal barrier results in a pharmacokinetic advantage associated with intraperitoneal ( IP) delivery of anticancer drugs. The anticancer efficacy of IP chemotherapy depends , however , on its ability to penetrate the tumor stroma. Tumor tissue transport is governed by diffusion and convection and is affected by numerous physical , biological , and pharmaceutical variables. From preclinical and clinical studies , it appears that tissue penetration after IP chemotherapy delivery is very limited. Several approaches are studied in order to improve tissue penetration of small molecular and macromolecular anticancer drugs after IP instillation.
