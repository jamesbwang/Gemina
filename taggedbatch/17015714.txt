 γδ T cells represent less than 5 % of circulating T cells; they exert a potent cytotoxic function against tumor or infected cells and secrete cytokines like conventional αβ T cells. As αβ T cells γδ T cells reside in the typical T cell compartments ( the lymph nodes and spleen) , but are more widely distributed in tissues throughout the body. For these reasons , some investigators are exploring the possibility of immunotherapies aimed to expand and activate Vδ2 T cells , or using them as Chimeric Antigen Receptor carriers. However , the role of immunosuppressive microenvironment on Vδ2 T cells during infections and cancers has not been completely elucidated. In particular , the effects of myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSC) , largely expanded in such pathologies , were not explored. In the present work , we demonstrated that MDSC may inhibit IFN-γ production and degranulation of phosphoantigen-activated Vδ2 T cells. Moreover , the Vδ2 T cells cytotoxic activity against the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Daudi and Jurkat cell line were impaired by MDSC. The Arginase I seems to be involved in the impairment of Vδ2 T cell function induced by both tumor cells and MDSC. These data open a key issue in the context of Vδ2-targeted immunoteraphy , suggesting the need of combined strategies aimed to boost Vδ2 T cells circumventing tumor- and MDSC-induced Vδ2 T cells suppression.
