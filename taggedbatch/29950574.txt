 There is growing global interest in Gross National Happiness ( GNH) as a metric to capture population well-being and economic development. Empirical evidence suggests that health is necessary for achievement of happiness. The growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases ( NCDs) threatens to undermine the achievement of GNH. We analyze synergies between current policy priorities and the institutional mechanism for GNH and the Global NCD Action Plan 2013-2020 that has informed Bhutan 's approach to NCDs. We identify strategic policy opportunities to strengthen outcomes for both policy areas. Lessons from Bhutan also suggest strategic opportunities to address NCDs in other countries where happiness is on the national agenda , or where action on NCDs could be improved through engagement between health and other sectors , especially where ways to promote and measure GNH ( population well-being) already exist.
