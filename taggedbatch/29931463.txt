 To heterologously produce the Shigella<pathogen> dysenteriae<pathogen> serotype 1 O-polysaccharide ( O-PS , O-antigen) in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> by transferring the minimum number of genes instead of the entire O-PS gene cluster. The three glycosyltransferase genes ( rfbR , rfbQ and rfp) responsible for the formation of the O-repeat unit were introduced into E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> K-12 W3110 to synthesize S.<pathogen> dysenteriae<pathogen> 1 O-PS. The specific O-antigen ladder type with different chain lengths of O-repeat units was observed in the recombinant E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strain by SDS-PAGE silver staining and western blotting using S.<pathogen> dysenteriae<pathogen> 1 lipopolysaccharide antiserum. Analysis by mass spectrometry and ion chromatography suggested generation of the specific S.<pathogen> dysenteriae<pathogen> 1 O-repeat unit structure with an extra glucose residue attached. Recombinant E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> expressing specific glycosyltransferase genes can generate the O-PS of S.<pathogen> dysenteriae<pathogen> 1 and might be able to synthesize heterologous O-antigens of various pathogenic bacteria for vaccine preparation.
