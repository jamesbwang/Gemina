 Typing of diffuse gliomas according to the WHO 2016 Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System is based on the integration of histology with molecular biomarkers. However , the choice of appropriate methods for molecular analysis and criteria for interpretation of test results is left to each diagnostic laboratory. In the present study , we tested the applicability of combined immunohistochemistry , direct sequencing , and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification ( MLPA) for diagnostic assessment of IDH1/2 mutation status , chromosome 1p/19q status , and TERT promoter mutations. To this end , we analyzed a consecutive series of 165 patients with diffuse low- and high-grade gliomas ( WHO grade II and III) from three Austrian centers in which tissue specimens were routinely processed. We could reliably detect IDH1/2 mutations by combining immunohistochemistry , direct sequencing , and MLPA analysis. MLPA analysis also allowed reliable detection of combined whole chromosomal arm 1p/19q codeletion when using carefully selected criteria providing an optimal balance<symptom> between sensitivity and specificity. Direct sequencing proved to be suitable for identification of TERT promoter mutations , although its analytical performance remains to be assessed. To conclude , we propose a practicable combination of methods and criteria which allow reliable molecular diagnostic testing of diffuse gliomas in the real-life setting..
