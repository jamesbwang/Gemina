 Impression management ( IM) refers to behaviors employees use to create and maintain desired images in the workplace. Prior studies have shown that the successful use of IM relates to a number of important outcomes for employees ( e.g. , higher performance evaluations) , but this work has tended to compare IM usage between individuals , ignoring the fact that employees likely adjust their use of IM depending on the situations they face at work on a given day. In this paper , we argue that managing impressions on a daily basis can be draining , thereby leaving employees susceptible to the temptation to engage in subsequent harmful behaviors at work. To better understand the nature and within-person consequences of IM , we examine the daily use of two supervisor-focused IM tactics-ingratiation and self-promotion-among 75 professionals in China over the course of two work weeks. Our results indicate that there is significant within-person variance in employees ' use of ingratiation and self-promotion aimed at supervisors. Moreover , our findings suggest that the use of ingratiation , but not self-promotion , depletes employees ' self-control resources. In the case of ingratiation , this depletion is positively associated with employee deviance , and the indirect effect is stronger among employees with low political skill. Overall , this research contributes to our understanding of the dynamic , within-person nature of IM , the consequences of IM for employees , and the dark side of IM for organizations.
