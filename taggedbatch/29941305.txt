 Treatment of rotator cuff ( RC) tears has not included bipolar muscle-tendon transfers to date. The objective of this study was to verify the feasibility of pedicled bipolar teres major ( TM) transfer over and under the long head of the triceps brachii ( LHT) and compare its versatility with monopolar transfer in a model of supraspinatus ( SS) tears in cadavers. In 6 shoulders of cryopreserved cadavers , we re-created complete SS tears , conducting monopolar and bipolar TM transfers over and under LHT. We compared the morphology of the SS and TM , defect coverage , angle between the transferred TM and major SS axis , and axillary nerve overlap with each technique. The TM and SS were morphologically similar. Defect coverage was significantly lower with monopolar transfer ( 12 ± 4 mm) than with bipolar transfer ( 39 ± 9 mm under the LHT , P = .003 , and 38 ± 8 mm over the LHT , P = .004). The bipolar transfer course over the LHT was the nearest to the SS axis ( 39 ° ± 11 ° , P = .005). We found a greater axillary nerve overlap with bipolar transfer under the LHT ( 27 ± 8 mm) than with bipolar transfer over the LHT ( 1 ± 2 mm , P = .005) or monopolar transfer ( 0 mm , P < .001). Bipolar TM transfer is possible without neurovascular pedicle interference , obtaining greater RC defect coverage and the closest path to the SS axis when conducted over the LHT compared with monopolar or bipolar transfer under the LHT. Accordingly , it can be considered an alternative option for the treatment of posterosuperior RC defects.
