 An analytical method based on UFLC-QTRAP-MS/MS was developed for simultaneous determination of fifteen components including eleven lignans ( schizantherin B , schisandrol B , schizandrin C , γ-schisandrin , deoxyschizandrin , schisantherin , schisandrin , schisanhenol , gomisin D , gomisin J , and angeloylgomisin H) and organic acids ( S)- malic acid , D (-)- tartaric acid , protocatechuic acid , and quinic acid) in Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus. Samples from different product specifications were evaluated and analyzed. The chromatographic separation was performed on a Synergi ™ Hydro-RP 100Å column ( 2.0 mm × 100 mm , 2.5 μm) at 40 °C with a gradient elution by employing 0.1 % aqueous formic acid ( A)- acetonitrile ( B) as the mobile phase , and the flow rate was 0.4 mL · min ⁻¹ , using an electrospray ionization ( ESI) source and multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM) mode. Fifteen components were evaluated synthetically by TOPSIS and gray related degree. The results showed that fifteen components had good linearity ( r > 0.999 90) , and the limits of detection were all satisfactory. The average recoveries of standard addition for the compounds were between 95.42 % and 98.86 % , and the relative standard deviations were less than 5 %. The greatest difference of ri in grey related degree was 58.1 % , whilst the greatest difference of Ci value in TOPSIS method was 94.8 %. The results of these two methods showed that the holistic quality of No. 14 sample was the best. The developed method was accurate and reliable , which was suitable for the simultaneous determination of multiple functional substances and able to provide a new basis for the comprehensive assessment and overall control of the quality of Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus.
