J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-High-intensity interval training ( HIIT) seems to be more effective than continuous training ( CT) for the improvement of physical condition and sports performance. This study compared physiological adaptations with HIIT and CT in flat water kayak athletes. Twenty-four national-class kayakists were divided into 3 groups ( n = 8 per group) , 2 of which participated in an 8-week CT or HIIT program , whereas the third one served as control ( C). An incremental maximum oxygen uptake ( V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max) , a maximal anaerobic Wingate-type , as well as 1,000-m ( T1 ,000 m) and 200-m ( T200 m) time test were performed before and after the training period on a kayak ergometer , to determine changes in V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max , peak blood lactate ( ( La) peak) , paddling speed at V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max ( PSVO2max) , heart rate at V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max ( HRpeak) , paddling economy speed ( PEs; speed at 75 % of V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max) , paddling speed at anaerobic ventilatory threshold ( PSVT2) , maximal paddling speed ( PSpeak) , and reduction of PSpeak ( PSR). V ( Combining Dot Above) O2max , ( La) peak , HRpeak , and PSR did not change after the 8-week training compared with baseline in either training group ( p > 0.05). However , significant changes were found in PSVT2 and T200 m ( HIIT) , PSVO2max , PEs , PSpeak , and T1 ,000 m ( CT and HIIT) ( p < 0.05-0.0001) as compared to baseline. Moreover , percent changes were different between the training groups in PEs , and between control and training groups in PSpeak and PSVO2peak ( p < 0.05-0.01). Both training programs improved physiological and performance variables; however , HIIT resulted in significant changes of PSVT2 and T200 m and higher improvement of PEs with 15 times less training time compared with CT.. Thus , HIIT seems more time-efficient than CT for improving paddling economy of kayaking performance.
