 The modulation of expression levels of fluorescent fusion proteins ( FFPs) is central for recombinant DNA technologies in modern biology as overexpression of proteins contributes to artifacts in biological experiments. In addition , some microscopy techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS) and single-molecule-based techniques are very sensitive to high expression levels of FFPs. To reduce the levels of recombinant protein expression in comparison with the commonly used , very strong CMV promoter , the herpes<disease> simplex<pathogen><disease> virus thymidine kinase ( TK) gene promoter , and mutants thereof were analyzed. Deletion mutants of the TK promoter were constructed and introduced into the Gateway
