 The earthworm Perionyx excavatus is a species highly capable of bidirectional regeneration. Pair-rule genes are thought to have an ancestral function in arthropod segmentation. However , orthologs in annelids ( i.e. Capitella teleta) do not exhibit segmental expression in the ectoderm or mesoderm. Their role in regeneration is currently unclear. Here , we report the expression profile of primary pair-rule genes ( Pex-EvxA , Pex-EvxB , Pex-RuntA , Pex-RuntB , Pex-Hes1A , Pex-Hes1B , Pex-Hes4A , and Pex-Hey) found in P. excavatus using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Our results indicated these genes showed variable expression during bidirectional regeneration. Six of these genes might play diverse and potentially critical roles in head and/or tail regeneration.
