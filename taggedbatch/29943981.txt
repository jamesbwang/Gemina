 Tyrosinase ( TYR) , a key enzyme in biosynthesis of melanin , usually functions as a biomarker of severe<symptom> skin diseases such as vitiligo and melanoma cancer. Accurate detection of TYR activity in vivo is urgent but still challenging. Inspired by the advantages of bioluminescence in vivo strategy in imaging and the specific hydroxylation of 3-hydroxybenzyloxy group by TYR , a bioluminogenic probe , TYR-LH
