 Nitrification inhibitors ( NIs) such as dicyandiamide ( DCD) and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate ( DMPP) provide an opportunity to reduce losses of reactive nitrogen ( Nr) from agricultural ecosystems. To understand the fate and efficacy of these two inhibitors , laboratory-scale experiments were conducted with
