 Infliximab is an anti-tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α ( TNFα) monoclonal antibody that treats moderate-to-severe Crohn 's disease. In rare cases , infliximab has been associated with drug-induced aseptic meningitis<disease><symptom>. We present a 46-year-old woman with migraines and inflammatory Crohn 's colitis<disease> treated with intravenous infliximab and methotrexate. She developed nuchal rigidity , photophobia<symptom> , and headache<symptom> 2 days after each of her infliximab infusions , with symptom resolution 1 week post-infusion. Her exam , imaging , and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were consistent with drug-induced aseptic meningitis<disease><symptom>. She discontinued infliximab and started vedolizumab with continued remission of her Crohn 's disease.
