 Acute cocoa flavanols ( CF) intake has been suggested to modulate cognitive function and neurovascular coupling ( NVC). Whether increased NVC is solely driven by improved vascular responsiveness or also by neuronal activity remains unknown. This study investigated the effects of acute CF intake on cognitive performance , NVC , and neuronal activity in healthy subjects in normoxia and hypoxia ( 4000 m simulated altitude; 12.7 % O Twenty healthy subjects ( age 23.2 ± 4.3 years) performed four trials. Participants performed a Stroop task and `` cognition '' battery 2 h after acute CF ( 530 mg CF , 100 mg epicatechin) or placebo intake , and 30 min after initial exposure to hypoxia or normoxia. Electroencephalogram and functional near-infrared spectroscopy were used to analyze hemodynamic changes and neuronal activity. CF enhanced NVC in the right prefrontal cortex during several tasks ( risk decision making , visual tracking , complex scanning , spatial orientation) , while neuronal activity was not affected. CF improved abstract thinking in normoxia , but not in hypoxia and did not improve other cognitive performances. Hypoxia decreased accuracy on the Stroop task , but performance on other cognitive tasks was preserved. NVC and neuronal activity during cognitive tasks were similar in hypoxia vs. normoxia , with the exception of increased β activity in the primary motor cortex during abstract thinking. Acute CF intake improved NVC , but did not affect neuronal activity and cognitive performance in both normoxia and hypoxia. Most cognitive functions , as well as NVC and neuronal activity , did not decline by acute exposure to moderate hypoxia in healthy subjects.
