 To assess the effect of short message service ( SMS) communication on facility delivery , exclusive breastfeeding ( EBF) and contraceptive use. MOBILE WACH WAS A 3-ARM UNBLINDED INDIVIDUALLY RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL: SETTING: A public sector maternal child health ( MCH) clinic in Nairobi , Kenya. Three hundred women attending antenatal care were randomised , 100 to each arm , and followed for 24 weeks postpartum.

Women were randomised ( 1:1:1) to receive 1-way SMS versus 2-way SMS with a nurse versus control. Weekly SMS content was tailored for maternal characteristics and pregnancy or postpartum timing. Facility delivery , EBF and contraceptive use were compared separately between each intervention arm and the control arm by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Î§ One-way and 2-way SMS improved EBF practices and early contraceptive use. Two-way SMS had an added benefit on sustained EBF , providing evidence that SMS messaging influences uptake of interventions that improve maternal and neonatal health.
