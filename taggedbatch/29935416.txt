 Brain microinfarcts are common in aging and are associated with cognitive impairment. Anterior and posterior watershed border zones lie at the territories of the anterior , middle , and posterior cerebral arteries , and are more vulnerable to hypoperfusion than brain regions outside the watershed areas. However , little is known about microinfarcts in these regions and how they relate to cognition in aging. Participants from the Rush Memory and Aging Project , a community-based clinical-pathologic study of aging , underwent detailed annual cognitive evaluations. We examined 356 consecutive autopsy cases ( mean age-at-death , 91 years ( SD = 6.16); 28 % men) for microinfarcts from 3 watershed brain regions ( 2 anterior and 1 posterior) and 8 brain regions outside the watershed regions. Linear regression models were used to examine the association of cortical watershed microinfarcts with cognition , including global cognition and 5 cognitive domains. Microinfarcts in any region were present in 133 ( 37 %) participants , of which 50 had microinfarcts in watershed regions. Persons with multiple microinfarcts in cortical watershed regions had lower global cognition ( estimate = -0.56 , standard error ( SE) = 0.26 , p = 0.03) and lower cognitive function in the specific domains of working memory ( estimate = -0.58 , SE = 0.27 , p = 0.03) and visuospatial abilities ( estimate = -0.57 , SE = 0.27 , p = 0.03) , even after controlling for microinfarcts in other brain regions , demographics , and age-related pathologies. Neither the presence nor multiplicity of microinfarcts in brain regions outside the cortical watershed regions were related to global cognition or any of the 5 cognitive domains. These findings suggest that multiple microinfarcts in watershed regions contribute to age-related cognitive impairment.
