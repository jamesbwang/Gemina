 BACKGROUND Women with polycystic ovary syndrome<disease><symptom> ( PCOS) undergoing in vitro fertilization ( IVF) are given letrozole before a trigger injection of human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG) to lower estrogen ( E2) levels , but can experience ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome<disease><symptom> ( OHSS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral letrozole , prior to administration of hCG , on the outcome of IVF and development of OHSS. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective clinical review included 181 cases of women with PCOS who underwent IVF cycles with intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI) and embryo transfer ( ET) ( IVF/ICSI-ET). The day before the use of hCG , cases were divided into a letrozole-treated group ( N = 78) and a non-letrozole group ( N = 103). An oral dose of 2.5 mg qd of letrozole was given when the peak level of E2 was â‰¥ 4000 pg/ml during ovarian stimulation and ceased before the day of egg retrieval. RESULTS The letrozole-treated group had a significant increase in the number of retrieved oocytes , viable embryos , and fresh ET rate ( P > 0.05); peak levels of E2 , and E2 levels on the day of the egg retrieval , were significantly higher , and the fertilization rate was significantly lower ( P < 0.001). No significant differences were found in the rates of pregnancy , abortion<disease><symptom> , or ectopic pregnancy between the two groups ( P > 0.05). The incidence OHSS was lower in the letrozole-treated group , but this difference did not reach statistical significance ( P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Women with PCOS who underwent IVF , oral treatment with letrozole a day prior to treatment with hCG lowered E2 levels , but did not significantly reduce the incidence of OHSS.
