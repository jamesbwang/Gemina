 Today , the neuroscience has growth in many aspects , and the effects of different factors on memory obtained many achievements. Several scientific and experimental studies evaluated effects of music on style and behavior of people; in this study , we evaluated memory between two groups of people , the professional pianists and normal people , through processing their electroencephalogram ( EEG) signals using the coherence measure. In this study , EEG signals from 17 subjects during two memory tasks were recorded. After that , these signals were preprocessed , and spectral coherence connectivity measure between pair of electrodes was computed and then compared in the five frequency bands using independent This statistical analysis for working memory task showed significant differences in the temporal , central , and parietal lobes , especially in P7 , P3 , Pz , T8 , C3 , and C4 electrodes. As we know , these differences are related to learned skills and activities , words and sounds perception , and memory. Furthermore , for iconic memory task , significant differences were observed in the right hemisphere of these two groups. From this task , we can say professional pianists are different from normal people in the perception of images and creativity. Results of this study show the effects of music on human brain and memory.
