 The aim of this work was to investigate the short- and long-term test-retest reliability of the 6-min walk distance ( 6MWD) , peak heart rate , and nadir oxygen desaturation in idiopathic pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( IPF). A reliability study of 70 adults with IPF was undertaken within out-patient pulmonary rehabilitation programs at 2 tertiary hospitals. Participants completed 2 baseline 6-min walk tests using a standard protocol , with continuous measures of percutaneous S Participants with a mean ± SD diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide of 48 ± 14 % were included. The reliability of the 6MWD was high ( intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.96) with a mean learning effect of 21 m ( 95 % CI 12-30 m). The learning effect persisted at 8 weeks ( mean 14 m , 95 % CI 5-23 m) but not 6 months ( mean 15 m , 95 % CI -1 to 30 m). Using the best ( greatest) 6MWD significantly reduced the proportion of participants who were classified as having a clinically important response to rehabilitation compared with using the first 6MWD ( 40 % vs 54 % , The 6MWD is a reproducible measure of exercise capacity in people with IPF. Whereas the nadir S
