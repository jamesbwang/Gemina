 Infratentorial subdural empyemas<disease> in children are extremely rare and potentially lethal intracranial infections. Delay in diagnosis and therapy is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. A 4-year-old boy presented with cerebellar signs following a failed treatment of otitis<disease> media<disease>. Imaging studies revealed a subdural empyema<disease> and left transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis. The empyema<disease> was evacuated operatively and antibiotic treatment was initiated and administered for 6 weeks. The patient recovered fully and was discharged 4 weeks following the evacuation of the empyema<disease>. While prompt identification and treatment of subdural infratentorial empyemas<disease> are crucial for favorable outcomes , their diagnosis in children might be initially missed. This is , in part because they are so rare and in part , because imaging artifacts arising from the complex posterior fossa anatomy may obscure their presence in the computer tomography ( CT) scan. Therefore , high level of suspicion is necessary , given the appropriate history and clinical presentation. In children , this is a recent history of protracted otitis<disease> media<disease> and central nervous system symptomatology-cerebellar or other.
