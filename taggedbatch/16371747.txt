 The aim of the study was to compare the different surgical approaches of two centers on outcomes of live donor laparoscopic nephrectomy. The first 98 patients of each centre who underwent laparoscopic donor nephrectomy ( LDN) or hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy ( HALDN) were included in the study. The following data were used for analyses: donor age , weight , height , body mass index ( BMI) , transfusion requirement , operative time , ischemia time and postoperative complications. Median age , BMI , operation time and estimated blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( EBL) was 47.29 years , 27.91 kg/m The operative and postoperative outcomes for the two techniques were found to be similar. The HALDN technique preserves the benefits of minimally invasive surgery. In experienced urologic laparoscopy centres both techniques promise similar success rates.
