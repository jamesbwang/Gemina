 Studying the structure-property relations of tailored dipolar phenyl and biphenylphosphonic acids , we report self-assembled monolayers with a significant decrease in the work function ( WF) of indium-tin oxide ( ITO) electrodes. Whereas the strengths of the dipoles are varied through the different molecular lengths and the introduction of electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms , the surface energy is kept constant through the electron-donating N , N-dimethylamine head groups. The self-assembled monolayer formation and its modification of the electrodes are investigated via infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy , contact angle measurements , and photoelectron spectroscopy. The WF decrease in ITO correlates with increasing molecular dipoles. The lowest ever recorded WF of 3.7 eV is achieved with the fluorinated biphenylphosphonic acid.
