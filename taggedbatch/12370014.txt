 Biomolecular mass spectrometry has matured strongly over the past decades and has now reached a stage where it can provide deep insights into the structure and composition of large cellular assemblies. Here , we describe a three-tiered hybrid mass spectrometry approach that enables the dissection of macromolecular complexes in order to complement structural studies. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach , we investigate ribosomes , large ribonucleoprotein particles consisting of a multitude of protein and RNA subunits. We identify sites of sequence processing , protein post-translational modifications , and the assembly and stoichiometry of individual ribosomal proteins in four distinct ribosomal particles of bacterial , plant and human origin. Amongst others , we report extensive cysteine methylation in the zinc finger domain of the human S27 protein , the heptameric stoichiometry of the chloroplastic stalk complex , the heterogeneous composition of human 40S ribosomal subunits and their association to the CrPV , and HCV internal ribosome entry site RNAs.
