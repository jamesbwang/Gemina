 It is known that early-deafened cochlear implant ( CI) users are a very heterogeneously performing group. To gain more insight into this population , this study investigated ( 1) postoperative changes in auditory performance over time based on various outcome measures , focusing on poor performers , ( 2) self-perceived outcomes , ( 3) relations between auditory and self-perceived outcomes , and ( 4) preimplantation factors predicting postoperative outcomes. Outcomes were assessed prospectively in a group of 27 early-deafened , late-implanted CI users , up to 3 years after implantation. Outcome measures included open-set word and sentence recognition , closed-set word recognition , speech tracking and a questionnaire on self-perceived outcomes. Additionally , the relative influence of 8 preimplantation factors on CI outcome was assessed with linear regression analyses. Significant improvements were found for auditory performance measures and most of the questionnaire domains. Significant changes of the closed-set word test , speech tracking and questionnaire were also found for a subgroup of poor performers. Correlations between auditory and self-perceived outcomes were weak and nonsignificant. Preoperative word recognition and preoperative hearing thresholds , both for the implanted ear , were significant predictors of postoperative outcome in the multivariable regression model , explaining 63.5 % of the variation. Outcome measurement in this population should be adjusted to the patients ' individual performance level and include self-perceived benefit. There is still a need for more knowledge regarding predictors of CI outcomes in this group , but the current study suggests the importance of the preoperative performance of the ear to be implanted.
