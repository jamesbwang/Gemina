 The practice of evidence-based medicine and critical appraisal are essential for the modern doctor. Early engagement of medical students in research methodology is considered as a rising need for most medical school curricula; however , few peer-reviewed initiatives have been reported so far. We developed a Medical Education Research Group ( eMERG) as part of a novel undergraduate surgical masterclass , which aimed to train undergraduate students on basic research methodology , as well as to motivate them to pursue a clinical and academic career in surgical specialties.Methods: eMERG consists of an international structured network of senior academics , consultant-level clinicians , senior and junior trainees who support undergraduate trainees. Students are selected from a competitive pool of applicants. Several small prospective studies in skills-based education , as well as systematic reviews on similar topics , have run under the umbrella of this framework , in the form of scholarship awards. Structured feedback questionnaires were distributed to evaluate the experience of the first three years. 12 students have participated in this pilot initiative. 11 manuscripts have been submitted for publication and 8 were accepted following peer-review in MEDLINE-indexed journals. Delegates perceived this experience as an excellent training opportunity which improved their research productivity. Delegates also stated engagement in research developed interest in the relevant surgical speciality , impacting their career aspirations. eMERG is one of the first reported European educational research networks for undergraduates. Research outcomes and students ' perceptions conclude that eMERG enhances engagement with research methodology and motivation towards a career in surgery.
