 A genome-wide association study ( GWAS) was conducted for two carcass traits in Chinese Simmental beef cattle. The experimental population consisted of 1301 individuals genotyped with the Illumina BovineHD SNP BeadChip ( 770K). After quality control , 671 990 SNPs and 1217 individuals were retained for the GWAS. The phenotypic traits included carcass weight and bone weight , which were measured after the cattle were slaughtered at 16 to 18 months of age. Three statistical models-a fixed polygene model , a random polygene model and a composite interval mapping polygene model-were used for the GWAS. The genome-wide significance threshold after Bonferroni correction was 7.44E-08 ( = 0.05/ 671 990). In this study , we detected eight and seven SNPs significantly associated with carcass weight and bone weight respectively. In total , 11 candidate genes were identified within or close to these significant SNPs. Of these , we found several novel candidate genes , including PBX1 , GCNT4 , ALDH1A2 , LCORL and WDFY3 , to be associated with carcass weight and bone weight in Chinese Simmental beef cattle , and their functional roles need to be verified in further studies.
