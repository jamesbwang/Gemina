 Erythrodermic psoriasis is a rare but severe type of psoriasis that may be triggered by human<pathogen><disease> immunodeficiency<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> infection. We describe the case of a 65-year-old male patient with chronic psoriasis who presents an exacerbation of his condition over a period of two weeks. Because of the severity of his case and subsequent need for systemic therapy , human<pathogen><disease> immunodeficiency<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> enzyme immunoassay was performed and tested positive. He thus began antiretroviral therapy combined with acitretin , showing good clinical response after 8 weeks of treatment. There is little evidence regarding the management of erythrodermic psoriasis associated with HIV<pathogen> infection , so antiretroviral therapy and systemic retinoid remain as the first-line treatment.
