 Bone sialoprotein ( BSP) , a member of the SIBLINGs ( for Small Integrin-Binding LIgand , N-linked Glycoproteins) family , has recently be associated to inflammatory and infectious<disease> diseases<disease>. We therefore measured BSP concentrations in 136 patients at admission to the intensive care unit ( ICU) and 3 days of ICU. BSP levels were compared to 36 healthy blood donors and correlated to clinical data. In these analysis , BSP serum levels were strongly elevated at the time point of admission to the ICU when compared to healthy controls. Moreover BSP concentrations were significantly elevated after 3 days of treatment on the intensive care unit. A further increase in BSP levels was detected in patients with higher APACHE-II-scores and in patients with septic disease. While in most patients , BSP levels decreased during the first three days of treatment on a medical ICU , patients with persistently elevated BSP levels displayed an unfavorable outcome. In these patients , persistently elevated BSP concentrations were a superior predictor of mortality than established indicators of patient ' prognosis such as the SAPS2 or the APACHE-II score. In summary , our data argue for a novel utility for BSP as a biomarker in patients treated on a medical ICU.
