 Acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( AHF) emerges either de novo or from worsening of chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( CHF). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between worsening of CHF and mortality in AHF patients. Out of 152 included AHF patients , 47 ( 30.9 %) were de novo AHF patients and 105 ( 69 %) were AHF patients with worsening of CHF. The proportion dying in hospital ( 19.0 % vs. 4.3 % , p = 0.023) and within 3 months after hospitalization ( 36.6 % vs. 6.7 % , p < 0.001) was significantly higher in AHF patients with worsening of CHF. Logistic regression analyses also showed a significant positive association of AHF emerging as worsening of CHF with hospital mortality ( odds ratio ( OR) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 5.29 ( 1.46-34.10) , p = 0.029) and 3-month mortality ( 8.09 ( 2.70-35.03) , p = 0.001). While the association with hospital mortality was no longer significant after adjusting for comorbidities and clinical as well as laboratory parameters known to be associated with mortality in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients , the association with 3-month mortality remained significant. We conclude that compared to de novo AHF , AHF evolved from worsening of CHF is a more severe condition and is associated with increased mortality.
