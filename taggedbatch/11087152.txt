 Immunosuppression plays an essential role to overcome immune-related allograft rejection , but it also causes some nephrotoxicity. This study aimed to investigate how the immunosuppressant combinations affect graft outcomes in kidney transplant recipients. A nationwide population-based cohort study using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database was conducted. A total of 3,441 kidney transplant recipients who underwent kidney transplantation during the targeted period were included. The effects on graft outcomes contributed by conventional immunosuppressants , including corticosteroid , calcineurin inhibitors , antimetabolite purine antagonists , and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors , were compared. A total of 423 graft failures developed after the index date. Therapy regimens incorporated with purine antagonists had a comparable reduction of graft failure among four main drug groups regardless of whether they were given as monotherapy or in combination ( adjusted hazard ratio: 0.52 , 95 % confidence interval: 0.42-0.63). Corticosteroid was found to have inferior effects among four groups ( adjusted hazard ratio: 1.67 , 95 % confidence interval: 1.28-2.21). Furthermore , all 15 arrangements of mutually exclusive treatment combinations were analyzed by referencing with corticosteroid monotherapy. As referenced with steroid-based treatment , regimens incorporated with purine antagonists all have superior advantage on graft survival regardless of whether given in monotherapy ( 65 % of graft failure reduced) , dual therapy ( 48 % -67 % reduced) , or quadruple therapy ( 43 % reduced). In all triple therapies , only corticosteroid combined with calcineurin inhibitor and purine antagonist demonstrated superior protection on graft survival ( 52 % of graft failure reduced). The results may recommend several superior regimens for contributing to graft survival , and for supporting a steroid-minimizing strategy in immunosuppression maintenance.
