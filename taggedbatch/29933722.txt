 Introduction Determining appropriate remuneration for teledermoscopy service is important because inadequate remuneration can be a barrier to practitioner uptake and participation. This study explores dermatologist remuneration expectations for a single lesion<symptom> store-and-forward teledermoscopy consultation. Methods Fourteen dermatologists participated in telephone interviews during May-June 2017. Questions regarding remuneration focused on a clinical scenario involving teledermoscopy of a single lesion<symptom> suspected to be skin cancer. The initial scenario was an existing patient , with a provisional diagnosis of benign neoplasm from the images , to be followed-up with routine skin checks , taking three minutes to review. Participants indicated their remuneration expectation by selecting from an ascending array of pre-determined remuneration ranges. The question was repeated a further four times with one aspect of the scenario changed each time; consultation length , source ( patient or general practitioner) , required follow-up , and a new rather than existing patient. Participants were also asked how appropriate they thought teledermoscopy was for the scenario , and whether they would choose to undertake the consultation presented. Results Nine dermatologists selected the AU$ 61-90 or AU$ 91-120 remuneration ranges for the initial scenario. When given the opportunity to comment on teledermoscopy service provision in Australia , respondents reflected that it was a valuable , advanced dermatology service , but they would prefer face-to-face consultation with patients where possible to allow for a full body examination. Discussion Dermatologists expect to be remunerated in the range of AU$ 61-120 for a single lesion<symptom> store-and-forward teledermoscopy consultation when face-to-face examination is not possible.
