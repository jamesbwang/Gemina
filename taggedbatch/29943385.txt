 Endoscopic papillary large balloon dilation ( EPLBD) without endoscopic sphincterotomy ( EST) may facilitate extraction of large bile duct stones through achieving adequate dilation of the ampulla. However , contrary to favorable long-term outcomes after endoscopic papillary balloon dilation ( EPBD) , that of EPLBD without EST has been little investigated. Therefore , we conducted the current study to evaluate short- and long-term outcomes of EPLBD without EST and EPBD after removal of large bile duct stones ( LBDS; ≥ 10 mm). This retrospective study included patients without a previous history of EST , EPBD or EPLBD who underwent EPLBD without EST or EPBD for removal of LBDS. Each patient in the EPLBD without EST group was matched to a patient in the EPBD group using propensity scores. Forty-four patients in each group were matched for the analysis. Baseline characteristics were balanced after propensity matching. Rate of complete stone removal in a single session was higher ( 80 % vs 16 % , P < 0.001) , number of ERCP sessions ( 1.3 ± 0.7 vs 2.4 ± 1.5 , P < 0.001) and rate of lithotripsy use ( 30 % vs 80 % , P < 0.001) were smaller in the matched EPLBD without EST group. Contrary to null between-group differences in early adverse events ( P = 0.99) , a cumulative rate of late biliary complications was higher in the EPLBD without EST group ( P = 0.02). EPLBD without EST showed higher efficacy for removal of LBDS but was associated with worse long-term outcomes when compared to EPBD.
