 This study presents the results of studies aimed at the development of an analytical procedure for separation , identification , and determination of PBDEs compounds in dust samples collected from automotive cabin air filters and samples collected from filters installed as part of the air purification system in academic facilities. Ultrasound-assisted dispersive solid phase extraction ( UA-dSPE) was found to perform better in terms of extract purification than the conventional SPE technique. GC-EIMS was used for final determination of analytes. The concentrations of PBDEs in car filters ranged from < LOD to 688 ng/g while from < LOD to 247 ng/g in dust from air conditioning filters. BDE-47 and BDE-100 were reported the dominating congeners. The estimated exposure to PBDEs via ingestion of dust from car filters varied from 0.00022 to 0.012 ng/day in toddlers and from 0.000036 to 0.0029 ng/day in adults; dust from air conditioning filters: from 0.017 to 0.25 ng/day in toddlers and from 0.0029 to 0.042 ng/day. In addition , an attempt was made at extracting PBDEs from a dust samples using the matrix solid-phase dispersion ( MSPD) technique as a promising alternative to conventional SPE separations.
