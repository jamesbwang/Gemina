 Hereditary spastic paraplegia<symptom> ( HSP) is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive<symptom> weakness<symptom> and spasticity of lower limbs. To clarify the genetic spectrum and improve the diagnosis of HSP patients , targeted next-generation sequencing ( NGS) was applied to detect the culprit genes in 55 Chinese HSP pedigrees. The classification of novel variants was based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics ( ACMG) standards and guidelines. Patients remaining negative following targeted NGS were further screened for gross deletions/duplications by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification ( MLPA). We made a genetic diagnosis in 61.8 % ( 34/55) of families and identified 33 mutations , including 14 known mutations and 19 novel mutations. Of them , one was de novo mutation ( NIPA1: c. 316G > A). SPAST mutations ( 22/39 , 56.4 %) are the most common in Chinese AD-HSP followed by ATL1 ( 4/39 , 10.3 %). Moreover , we identified the third BSCL2 mutation ( c. 1309G > C) related to HSP by further functional studies and first reported the KIF1A mutation ( c. 304G > A) in China. Our findings broaden the genetic spectrum of HSP and improve the diagnosis of HSP patients. These results demonstrate the efficiency of targeted NGS to make a more rapid and precise diagnosis in patients with clinically suspected HSP.
