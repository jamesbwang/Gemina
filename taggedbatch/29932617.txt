 To validate a morphokinetic implantation model developed for EmbryoScope on embryos with known outcome , compared to standard morphology in a retrospective single center study. Morphokinetic annotation of 768 embryos with known outcome between 2013 -2015; corresponding to 116 D3 fresh embryos , 80 D6 frozen blastocysts , and 572 D5 blastocysts , fresh or frozen. The embryos were ranked by the KIDScore into five classes , KID1-5 , and grouped into four classes based on standard morphology. Pregnancy rates , clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates were compared. Combinations of morphology and morphokinetics were evaluated for implantation rates and live births. Live birth rate increased with increasing KIDScore , from 19 % for KID1 to 42 % for KID5. Of all live births , KID5 contributed with 71 % , KID4 with 20 % , KID3 with 4 % , KID2 with 4 % , and KID1 with 2 %. For morphology , the corresponding figure was 43 % for Top Quality , 47 % for Good Quality , 4 % for Poor<symptom> Quality , and 5 % for Slow embryos. For day 3 embryos , KID5 embryos had the highest live birth rates , and contributed to 83 % of the live births; whereas the second best morphological class had the highest live birth rate and contributed to most of the live births. For blastocysts , the KIDScore and morphology performed equally well. Combining morphology and morphokinetics indicated stronger predictive power for morphokinetics. Overall , the KIDScore correlates with both implantation and live birth in our clinical setting. Compared to morphology , the KIDScore was superior for day 3 embryos , and equally good for blastocysts at predicting live births.
