 INHBA , which encodes a member of the TGF-beta superfamily of proteins , has been identified to play a critical role in different types of cancer. However , its clinical significance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC) has never been reported. In this study , we collected 239 ESCC paraffin-embedded specimens and measured the expression of INHBA with immunohistochemistry ( IHC). The clinical and prognostic significance of INHBA expression was statistically analyzed. What is more , we conducted a meta-analysis to study the prognostic value of INHBA expression in multiple types of solid tumors. The results showed that INHBA expression was observed predominantly in the cytoplasm of cells in the ESCC specimens. INHBA expression was closely correlated with N categories ( High INHBA level predicts poor prognosis in ESCC and other solid tumors. More studies are required to elucidate the role of INHBA and its clinical application in cancer settings.
