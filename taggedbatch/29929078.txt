 An efficient chemoenzymatic route was developed for synthesis of ( S)- α-amino-4-fluorobenzeneacetic acid , a valuable chiral intermediate of Aprepitant , using immobilized penicillin amidase catalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic N-phenylacetyl-4-fluorophenylglycine. The optimum temperature , pH and agitation rate of the reaction were determined to be 40 °C , 9.5 and 300 rpm , respectively. Kinetic resolution of 80 g L
