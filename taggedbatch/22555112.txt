 The optimal treatment for polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy ( PCV) is still under debate. Little knowledge is known about the treatment effect of `` 1 + pro re nata ( PRN) '' treatment regimen for PCV. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of photodynamic therapy ( PDT) , intravitreal ranibizumab injection ( IVR) and combination therapy under the `` 1 + PRN '' treatment regimen for PCV. Fifty-seven eyes of 57 patients completed the 12 months ' follow-up in this prospective study. The patients in the PDT arm ( n = 23) , ranibizumab arm ( n = 18) , or combination arm ( n = 16) underwent a session of PDT , IVR or combination of both at baseline followed by additional IVR as needed. Mean change of logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution ( logMAR) visual acuity ( VA) , central foveal thickness ( CFT) and the regression rate of polyps were evaluated. Cost-benefit analysis was also performed. At Month 12 , the mean logMAR VA improved from 0.90 ± 0.52 to 0.75 ± 0.57 in the PDT group ( P < 0.05) , from 0.96 ± 0.58 to 0.77 ± 0.41 in the IVR group ( P < 0.05) , and from 0.94 ± 0.55 to 0.72 ± 0.44 in the combination group ( P < 0.05) , respectively. The CFT decreased from 478.04 ± 156.70 μm , 527.5 ± 195.90 μm , and 522.63 ± 288.40 μm at the baseline to 366.43 ± 148.28 μm , 373.17 ± 134.88 μm and 328.44 ± 103.25 in the PDT group ( P < 0.05) , IVR group ( P < 0.01) , and the combination group ( P < 0.05) , respectively. However , no statistical difference was found between groups ( P > 0.05). PDT treatment ( 60.87 %) was superior to the IVR therapy ( 22.22 %) in achieving complete regression of polyps ( P < 0.05). Cost-benefit analysis showed that IVR treatment cost the least money for improving per 0.1 logMAR units and the combination therapy demanded the least money for reducing per 100 μm of CFT. PDT , IVR and the combination therapy have similar efficacy in the VA improvement as well as the reduction of CFT under the `` 1 + PRN '' treatment regimen. Current Controlled Trials NCT03459144.
