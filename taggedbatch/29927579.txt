 In semiconductors , increasing mobility with decreasing temperature is a signature of charge carrier transport through delocalized bands. Here , we show that this behavior can also occur in nanocrystal solids due to temperature-dependent structural transformations. Using a combination of broadband infrared transient absorption spectroscopy and numerical modeling , we investigate the temperature-dependent charge transport properties of well-ordered PbS quantum dot ( QD) solids. Contrary to expectations , we observe that the QD-to-QD charge tunneling rate increases with decreasing temperature , while simultaneously exhibiting thermally activated nearest-neighbor hopping behavior. Using synchrotron grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering , we show that this trend is driven by a temperature-dependent reduction in nearest-neighbor separation that is quantitatively consistent with the measured tunneling rate.
