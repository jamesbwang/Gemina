 Thirteen natural products derivatives of hydroxyl amide class , three described for the first time , were synthesized by reaction of three indole acids and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid with six different amino alcohols in the presence of triphenylphosphine and N-bromosuccinimide. The derivatives were tested against the Gram ( +) bacteria Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and Bacillus<pathogen> cereus<pathogen> , Gram (-) Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> and Escherichia<pathogen> coli , besides the yeast Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen>. One of the compounds ( 7) was selectively active against C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> ( 91.3 ± 0.49 % inhibition) showing a great potential as a new drug lead , since it was more active than the positive control , miconazole ( 88.7 ± 2.41 % inhibition). Regarding bacterial inhibition , compounds demonstrated mild activity , but inhibition of compounds 9 , 10 and 13 towards E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> is of interest since it is difficult to find drugs selectively active against Gram (-) bacteria. Most of the compounds were very active in the acetylcholinesterase inhibition assay. Compound 7 was again the most active ( 93.2 ± 4.47 %) , being more potent than the control galantamine ( 90.3 ± 0.45 %). The most active gallic acid derivatives , compounds 3 , 7 and 8 have in common , besides gallic acid skeleton , a ( CH2) 2OH group , which may be one of the structural requirements for AChE inhibition.
