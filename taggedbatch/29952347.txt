 Numerous studies have reported the association of cardiovascular risk factors with pulmonary embolism ( PE) , but the association of dietary factors , especially fish intake , with the risk of PE has not been fully established.Methods and Results: Using a prospective design , we studied the risk of PE mortality in relation to fish intake in 90,791 community-dwelling men and women in Japan aged 40-79 years. The hazard ratios ( HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) for PE death were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Compared with participants in the lowest fresh fish intake group ( < 1 time/month) , the HRs ( 95 % CIs) for PE death for those in the other intake groups were 0.35 ( 0.08-1.59) for 1-2 times/month , 0.19 ( 0.05-0.69) for 1-2 times/week , 0.20 ( 0.06-0.74) for 3-4 times/week , and 0.18 ( 0.05-0.66) for fish intake every day. In addition to these findings , compared with the participants in the lowest 10 % of Ï‰3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake , those in the other groups had a 60-76 % lower risk of PE death. Fresh fish intake , even 1-2 times/week , is associated with a lower risk of death from PE among Japanese men and women.
