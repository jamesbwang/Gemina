 Cardiovascular diseases are a health problem throughout the world , especially in people with diabetes. The identification of cardiovascular disease biomarkers can improve risk stratification. Sclerostin is a modulator of the Wnt/Î²-catenin signalling pathway in different tissues , and it has recently been linked to vascular biology. The current study aimed to evaluate the relationship between circulating sclerostin levels and cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. We followed up a cohort of 130 participants ( mean age 56.8 years; 48.5 % females; 75 with type 2 diabetes; 46 with prevalent cardiovascular disease) in which serum sclerostin levels were measured at the baseline. Time to death ( both of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes) was assessed to establish the relationship between sclerostin and mortality. We found that serum sclerostin concentrations were significantly higher in patients with prevalent cardiovascular disease ( p < 0.001) , and independently associated with cardiovascular mortality ( p = 0.008) , showing sclerostin to be a stronger predictor of mortality than other classical risk factors ( area under the curve = 0.849 vs 0.823). The survival analysis showed that an increase of 10 pmol/L in the serum sclerostin level resulted in a 31 % increase in cardiovascular mortality. However , no significant association was observed between sclerostin levels and non-cardiovascular mortality ( p = 0.346). From these results , we conclude that high sclerostin levels are related to mortality due to cardiovascular causes. The clinical implication of these findings is based on the possible use of serum sclerostin as a new biomarker of cardiovascular mortality risk in order to establish preventive strategies.
