 The mortality rate of acute liver failure significantly increases due to fatal septicemia<disease><symptom>. Inactive rhomboid protein 2 ( iRhom2) is an essential regulator of shedding TNF-α by trafficking with TNF-α converting enzyme ( TACE). Fisetin , a flavonoid present in various fruits and plants , possesses anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory activities. Here , multi-combination nanoparticles Fe@Au conjugated with fisetin , iRhom2 small interfering RNA ( siRNA) , and TNF-α inhibitor ( FN) are prepared to examine their effects on fatal septicemia-associated hepatic failure induced by Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> ( LM) in mice and to reveal the underlying mechanisms. After LM infection , upregulation of glutamic-oxalacetic transaminease , glutamic-pyruvic transaminase , alkaline phosphatase , TNF-α , malondialdehyde , H
