 Duchenne Muscular dystrophy ( DMD) is an inherited fatal X-linked myogenic disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 3500 male live births. It affects voluntary muscles , and heart and breathing muscles. DMD is characterised by continuous degeneration and regeneration cycles resulting in extensive fibrosis<disease> and a progressive reduction in muscle mass. Since the identification of a reduction in dystrophin protein as the cause of this disorder , numerous innovative and experimental therapies , focusing on increasing the levels of dystrophin , have been proposed , but the clinical improvement has been unsatisfactory. Dystrophin forms the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex and its proteins have been studied as a promising novel therapeutic target to treat DMD. Among these proteins , cell surface glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs<symptom>) are found almost ubiquitously on the surface and in the extracellular matrix of mammalian cells. These macromolecules interact with numerous ligands , including extracellular matrix constituents , adhesion molecules and growth factors that play a crucial role in muscle development and maintenance. In this article , we have reviewed in vitro , in vivo and clinical studies focused on the functional role of GAGs<symptom> in the pathophysiology of DMD with the final aim of summarising the state of the art of GAG dysregulation within the extracellular matrix in DMD and discussing future therapeutic perspectives.
