 Herein , we report a novel paper-based electrochemical sensor for on-site detection of sulphur mustards. This sensor was conceived combining office paper-based electrochemical sensor with choline oxidase enzyme to deliver a sustainable sensing tool. The mustard agent detection relies on the evaluation of inhibition degree of choline oxidase , which is reversibly inhibited by sulphur mustards , by measuring the enzymatic by-product H
