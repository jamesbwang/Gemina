 In this report , we use data from FDA 's Sentinel System to focus on how augmenting a diagnosis-based chronic kidney disease cohort with patients identified through laboratory results impacts cohort characteristics and outcomes. We used data from 2 Data Partners. Patients were eligible if they were health plan members on January 1 , 2012. We classified chronic kidney disease patients into mutually exclusive categories according to the hierarchy of ( 1) ICD-9-CM diagnosis ( DXGroup) , or ( 2) two estimated glomerular filtration rates < 60 mL/min/1 .73 m We identified 209 864 patients: 107 607 in DxGroup ( 51 %) and 102 257 ( 49 %) from laboratory data alone. For every characteristic , the DxGroup was the sickest , followed by the 2-LabGroup and then the 1-LabGroup. The DxGroup was more likely to die than 2-LabGroup ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 1.47; 95 % CI , 1.22-1.77) at Site 1; that effect was observed , but attenuated , at Site 2 ( HR , 1.16; 95 % CI , 1.07-1.25). The DxGroup was more likely to die than the 1-LabGroup at Site 1 ( HR , 1.36; 95 % CI , 1.20-1.55) , but not at Site 2 ( HR , 0.94; 95 % CI , 0.89-1.00). We suggest that drug safety researchers consider whether the method of cohort identification contributes to generalizability of safety findings.
