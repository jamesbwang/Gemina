 In this paper , classic preparations in Treatise on Febrile Diseases were systematically investigated to obtain their process parameters , and provide literature evidence and technical support for drug research and development. This paper includes the following sections: drug dose , solvents , excipients , and process parameters of classic preparations. The drug dose in Treatise on Febrile Diseases was not consistent with that in Pharmacopoeia of the People 's Republic of China 2015 , for example , `` Yi-Liang '' was about 15.625 g , and `` Yi-Sheng '' was about 200 mL. The solvents of classic preparations can be divided into two types: wine and water. There were eight kinds of water: water , `` Dongliu water '' `` Ganlan water '' `` acid pulp '' `` Jinghua water '' `` Lao water '' `` Mafei Tang '' `` spring water ''. There four kinds of wines: `` wine '' `` Bai wine '' `` Qing wine '' `` Ku wine ''. There were two kinds of excipients: rice and honey. Classic prescription powder had two kinds of processes: `` whole prescription powder '' and `` Yidaoshai Hezhizhi powder ''. Classic prescription pills had three kinds of processes: direct whole prescription pilling , pilling after extraction , and pilling with excipients after smashing. Classic prescription decoction had six kinds of processes: `` wine Tang '' , `` Mafei Tang '' , `` Jingmi Tang '' , `` Mijian Tang '' , `` water Tang '' `` Zhugao Tang ''. Drug dose , solvents , excipients , processes and other key parameters of classic preparations were systemically reviewed in this study , and the process parameters were clarified to provide literature evidence and technical support for drug development.
