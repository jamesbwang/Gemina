 There is significant scarcity of specialists to provide care for children with epilepsy in many parts of the world. Telemedicine is a potential future option. This study was planned to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of telephone consultation to identify Critical Clinical Events ( breakthrough seizures<symptom> , drug non-compliance , drug adverse events , features of raised intracranial pressure , and other disease-related events) , compared to the Face-to-Face consultation ( gold standard) , in children with Neurocysticercosis ( NCC) and symptomatic seizures<symptom> , following the completion of cysticidal therapy. Children aged 2-15 years attending a tertiary health care facility with a diagnosis of NCC and symptomatic seizures<symptom> were enrolled after completion of the cysticidal therapy. The parents were contacted by a Pediatric Neurology Resident on Telephone before the scheduled hospital visit. Subsequently , all the children were seen directly in hospital the next day by another Pediatric Neurology Resident. The information was noted on a structured questionnaire. The diagnostic accuracy of telephone consultation for identifying the Critical Clinical Events was estimated using Face-to-Face consultation as the gold standard. A total of 1145 potential events were evaluated. Of these , the face-to-face consultation identified 56 events that would need hospital visit for detailed evaluation ( breakthrough seizures<symptom> in 19 , drug non-compliance in 15 , adverse drug events in 11 , features of raised intracranial pressure in 8 , and other disease-related events in 3) , and 1089 events that did not require hospital consultation. The sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative predictive values of telephone consultation were 89.28 % ( 78.12-95.96) , 97.61 % ( 96.52-98.43) , 65.79 % ( 54.01-76.30) , and 99.43 % ( 98.78-99.79) respectively. The likelihood ratios when telephone consultation was positive and negative were 37.3 and 0.11 respectively. Telephone consultation is an acceptable mode of follow-up for children with mild Neurocysticercosis and symptomatic seizures<symptom> after completion of cysticidal therapy.
