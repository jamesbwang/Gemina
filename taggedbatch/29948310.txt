 Limited health literacy has been associated with adverse outcomes in children. We evaluated this association in the setting of chronic kidney disease ( CKD). We assessed the parental health literacy of 367 children enrolled in the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children ( CKiD) Study , using the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy ( STOFHLA). We evaluated the association between parental health literacy and CKD progression , defined as time to the composite event of renal replacement therapy ( RRT , dialysis , or kidney transplant) or 50 % decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR). Median CKiD participant age was 9.5 years , 63 % were male , and 59 % non-Hispanic white. Median eGFR at baseline was 63 ml/min/1 .73 m In this cohort of children with CKD , higher parental health literacy was associated with a nearly 30 % longer time to the composite CKD progression outcome.
