 The inability of neurons to undergo mitosis renders damage to the central or peripheral nervous system. Neural stem cell therapy could provide a path for treating the neurodegenerative diseases. However , reliable and simple tools for the developing and testing neural stem cell therapy are still required. Here , we show the development of a micropillar-based microfluidic device to trap the uniform-sized neurospheres. The neurospheres trapped within micropillar arrays were largely differentiated into neuronal cells , and their neurite networks were observed in the microfluidic device. Compared to conventional cultures on glass slides , the neurite networks generated with this method have a higher reproducibility. Furthermore , we demonstrated the effect of thapsigargin on the neurite networks in the microfluidic device , demonstrating that neural networks exposed to thapsigargin were largely diminished and disconnected from each other. Therefore , this micropillar-based microfluidic device could be a potential tool for screening of neurotoxins.
