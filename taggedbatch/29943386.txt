 Octacalcium phosphate ( OCP) and collagen ( col<pathogen>) composite ( OCPcol) demonstrated superior bone regeneration properties , and its commercialization appears to be forthcoming. As a practical medical material for new combination products , we developed a freeze-dried composite with OCPcol and teriparatide ( TPTD) ( OCPcolTPTDf) , and investigated its bone regenerative properties. A disk of OCPcol was made by mixing OCP granules and atelocollagen for medical use. Then , OCPcolTPTDf was prepared by impregnation of the OCPcol disk with 1.0 or 0.1 Âµg of TPTD solution ( OCPcolTPTDf 1.0 and OCPcolTPTDf 0.1 , respectively) followed by lyophilization. In vitro release profiles of TPTD from OCPcolTPTDf were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Implantation of OCPcolTPTDf or OCPcol was carried out for a rat critical-sized calvarial defect. And five defects in each group were collected after 12 weeks of implantation. The retention-release profiles of TPTD from OCPcolTPTDf supported a higher degree of retention of TPTD. Radiographic , histological , and histomorphometric examinations indicated that regenerated bone was filled in most of the defects of the OCPcolTPTDf. Additionally , the OCPcolTPTDf groups showed significantly enhanced bone regeneration compared with the OCPcol group. These results suggested that this newly developed bone regenerative composite could be a practical medical material.
