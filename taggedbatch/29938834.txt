 Common paediatric perimetry techniques require central fixation and subjective responses , which may be challenging for young or cognitively impaired children. The Saccadic Vector Optokinetic Perimeter ( SVOP) was designed to overcome these challenges by using infra-red eye tracking to assess the visual field. This study assessed the clinical feasibility of SVOP in children without visual impairment , comparing it to current paediatric techniques , and in children with visual impairment. Participants were recruited into two cohorts: children without visual impairment ( visual acuity ≥ 6/7 .5) and children with visual impairment ( visual acuity ≤ 6/18). Children without visual impairment attempted the Goldmann perimeter , confrontation method , and SVOP. Children with visual impairment attempted SVOP , when clinically indicated , as part of a full ophthalmic assessment. Visual field results and test length were recorded. Twenty-three children without visual impairment ( 4-14 years old) attempted all three visual field assessments. Full results were recorded for 91 per cent of children with SVOP , 87 per cent with Goldmann , and 100 per cent with confrontation SVOP was significantly faster than Goldmann ( p < 0.001) and confrontation ( p = 0.003). Thirty-five children with visual impairment ( 3-19 years old) with visual acuity ranging from 6/9 .5 to worse than 6/360 ( mean of 0.8 ± 0.4 logMAR) attempted SVOP , with 26 children able to complete SVOP. This is the largest study to date of the clinical applicability of SVOP in children without visual impairment , as well as assessing the utility of SVOP in children with visual impairment. Further research is needed to assess the accuracy of SVOP in a range of paediatric ocular disorders. SVOP may potentially offer a visual field assessment method for children previously unable to complete current paediatric perimetry techniques.
