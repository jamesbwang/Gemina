 In this outbreak , 12 patients in intensive care units acquired a Chryseobacterium<pathogen> indologenes<pathogen> infection. Cultures from sinkholes and air samples were positive for C.<pathogen> indologenes<pathogen>. After removing wash basins , no new cases appeared. Sinkholes , potentially contaminated , can act as a reservoir for C.<pathogen> indologenes<pathogen> and other microorganisms. Thus , patients and equipment should be protected from sink splashes to avoid contamination.
