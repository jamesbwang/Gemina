 Early non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) represents 16 % of all new NSCLC at diagnosis with a 5-year survival rate of about 60 %. Surgical intervention and adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy represent the cornerstone treatments , but no significant advances have been achieved since several decades in term of relapse rate reduction or survival improvement. Immunotherapy represents an appealing strategy considering the acceptable toxicity proÔ¨Åle but , despite the awesome changing recently introduced in the locally advanced and metastatic setting , its role in early NSCLC is not clear yet. In the past few years , two strategies have been investigated to improve the early NSCLC outcomes eliciting the anti-tumour immune response: tumour vaccines and adoptive cellular therapies. However , none of them provided convincing results. Preclinical and clinical data supported the prognostic role of immune checkpoints in resected NSCLC even if they did not show a clear predictive value for adjuvant treatment. However , some preliminary data about safety and efficacy of neo-adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors encourage further investigation of their potential role as monotherapy or as part of a multimodal strategy. Then , even if no significant progress has been done in early NSCLC treatment until today , checkpoint inhibitors can open the door to a new strategy in this setting.
