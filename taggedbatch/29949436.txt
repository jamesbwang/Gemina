 Although understanding of the neuronal development of Trochozoa has progressed recently , little attention has been paid to freshwater bivalves , including species with a strong ecological impact , such as the zebra mussel ( Dreissena polymorpha). Therefore , an important question might concern how the developing nervous system is involved in the formation of the rapid and successful invasive behavior of this species. Our aim was to reveal the neuronal development of trochophore and veliger larvae of Dreissena , with special attention to the organization of sensory structures and their possible involvement in detecting environmental cues. After applying serotonin and FMRFamide immunocytochemistry , the first serotonin immunoreactive sensory elements appeared 16-18 hours after fertilization , whereas the first FMRFamide immunoreactive sensory cell was seen only at 32 hours of development ( trochophore stage). Later , sensory elements were found in three parts of the larval body , including the apical organ , the posterior region , and the stomach. Although differences in the timing of appearance and the morphology of cells were observed , the two signaling systems showed basic similarity in their organization pattern until the end of the veliger stage. Pharmacological , physiological , and quantitative immunocytochemical investigations were also performed , suggesting the involvement of both the serotoninergic system and the FMRFamidergic system in sensomotor processes. Manipulation of the serotonin synthesis by para-chloroplenylalanine and 5-hydroxytryptophane , as well as application of increased salinity , influenced larval swimming activity , both accompanied by changes in immunofluorescence intensity. We concluded that these two early sensory systems may play an important role in the development of settlement competency of this biofouling invasive bivalve , Dreissena.
