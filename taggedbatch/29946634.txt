 To investigate the expression of VEGF in periodontal tissues and its role in bone remodeling during orthodontic tooth movement in rats. Rat model of tooth movement was established , and 30 rats in the experimental group were divided into 5 groups , 6 rats in each group. At 2 days , 4 days , 7 days , 14 days and 20 days , the rats were sacrificed to make periodontal tissue slice. The morphological changes of periodontal tissue were observed under H-E staining , and the expression of VEGF was semi-quantitatively analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The data were analyzed using SPSS21 .0 software package. Expression of VEGF in normal rat periodontal tissues was very weak or without positive expression; 2 days after tooth movement , VEGF expression in periodontal tissues began to increase from seventh to fourteenth days; on the fourteenth day , the expression reached a peak; after twentieth day , the expression of VEGF decreased slightly , but still higher than the control group. The expression of VEGF was mainly found in the cytoplasm of vascular endothelial cells , osteoblasts , fibroblasts , and osteoclasts. Expression of VEGF may play an important role in the early remodeling of periodontal tissues during orthodontic tooth movement.
