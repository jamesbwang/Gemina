 The rise in mercury concentrations in lake sediment deposited over the last âˆ¼ 150 years is widely recognized to have resulted from human activity. However , few studies in the Great Lakes region have used lake sediment to reconstruct atmospheric mercury deposition on millennial time scales. Here we present a 9000-year mercury record from sediment in Copper Falls; a small closed-basin lake on the Keweenaw Peninsula. Prior to abrupt increases in the 19
