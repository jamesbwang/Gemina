 Because Tachia guianensis ( Gentianaceae) is a `` non-specialized myrmecophyte '' associated with 37 ant species , we aimed to determine if its presence alters the ant guild associated with sympatric `` specialized myrmecophytes '' ( i.e. , plants sheltering a few ant species in hollow structures). The study was conducted in a hilly zone of a neotropical rainforest where two specialized myrmecophytes grow at the bottom of the slopes , another at mid-slope , and a fourth on the hilltops. Tachia guianensis , which occurred everywhere , had its own guild of associated ant species. A network analysis showed that its connections with the four other myrmecophytes were rare and weak , the whole resulting in a highly modular pattern of interactions with one module ( i.e. , subnetwork) per myrmecophyte. Three ant species parasitized three out of the four specialized myrmecophytes ( low nestedness noted) , but were not or barely associated with T. guianensis that therefore did not influence the parasitism of specialized myrmecophytes.
