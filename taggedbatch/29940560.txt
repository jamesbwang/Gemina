 With the increasing incidence of births of very preterm very-low-birth-weight infants , there is a demand for echocardiographic reference values of cardiac dimensions. The aim of this study was to provide reference values of cardiac valve annulus diameters in a cohort of extremely preterm very-low-birth-weight neonates and to correlate these with patient characteristics. Valve diameters of 376 infants of < 32 weeks ' gestation and with a birth weight of â‰¤ 2,000 g were measured using 2-dimensional echocardiography. Correlations between valve diameters and patient characteristics ( birth length/weight , body surface area , gestational age , and sex) were assessed. Birth weight was used to establish linear regression models. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was assessed through intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC) analysis. Substantial variability was found ( aortic valve mean ( standard deviation; range): 5.0 mm ( 0.6; 3.7-6.5); pulmonic valve: 5.8 mm ( 0.8; 3.4-7.9); mitral valve: 8.0 mm ( 1.0; 5.5-10.5); tricuspid valve: 7.6 mm ( 1.2; 4.9-10.6)). There was a moderate correlation between birth weight and valve diameter ( R2 aortic valve: 0.36; pulmonic valve: 0.20; mitral valve: 0.24; tricuspid valve: 0.24). Adequate intraobserver ( ICC range 0.74-0.91) and interobserver agreement ( ICC range 0.77-0.89) was found. Our study provides ready-to-use reference values for cardiac valve annulus diameters for extremely preterm infants.
