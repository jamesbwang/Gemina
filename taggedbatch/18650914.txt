 The aim was to determine the prognostic value of the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR) in patients with completely resected stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). The study enrolled 382 NSCLC patients , and an optimal NLR cutoff value was determined by ROC analysis. Patients were divided by preoperative NLR into low ( < 1.5 , n = 99) , intermediate ( 1.5 ≤ NLR < 3.5 , n = 245) , and high ( NLR ≥ 3.5 , n = 38) value groups. Serum diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites ( d-ROMs) were assayed in 33 consecutive patients and used as an indicator of oxidative stress. The mean NLR in patients with high d-ROMs ( > 300 U.CARR , n = 16) was 1.72 ± 0.67 , which was significantly higher than that in patients with low d-ROMs ( 1.41 ± 0.39 , n = 17; P = 0.018). The 3- , 5- and 10-year survival rates in the three NLR groups were 92 , 77 , and 59 % ( low); 82 , 70 , and 50 % ( intermediate); and 76 , 58 , and 32 % ( high) ( P = 0.034). The 1- , 3- and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates in the three groups were 98 , 90 , and 86 % ( low) , 91 , 77 , and 74 % ( intermediate); and 92 , 77 , and 68 % ( high) ( P = 0.033). Multivariate analysis found that although NLR was not predictive of overall survival , high NLR was an independent risk factor of recurrence ( hazard ratio: 2.03 , 95 % confidence interval: 1.17-3.79 , P = 0.011) as were as age , pathological stage , tumor differentiation , and lymph-vascular invasion. A low preoperative NLR predicted good prognosis , and was associated with low systemic inflammation<symptom> status in patients with stage 1 NSCLC. It may be helpful when considering intervals of routine follow-up or choice of adjuvant therapy.
