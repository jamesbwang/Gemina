 Recent advances in MRI offer a variety of useful markers to identify neurodegenerative diseases. In Huntington 's disease ( HD) , regional brain atrophy begins many years prior to the motor onset ( during the `` premanifest '' period) , but the spatiotemporal pattern of regional atrophy across the brain has not been fully characterized. Here we demonstrate an online cloud-computing platform , `` MRICloud '' , which provides atlas-based whole-brain segmentation of T1-weighted images at multiple granularity levels , and thereby , enables us to access the regional features of brain anatomy. We then describe a regression model that detects statistically significant inflection points , at which regional brain atrophy starts to be noticeable , i.e. the `` change-point '' , with respect to a disease progression index. We used the CAG-age product ( CAP) score to index the disease progression in HD patients. Change-point analysis of the volumetric measurements from the segmentation pipeline , therefore , provides important information of the order and pattern of structural atrophy across the brain. The paper illustrates the use of these techniques on T1-weighted MRI data of premanifest HD subjects from a large multicenter PREDICT-HD study. This design potentially has wide applications in a range of neurodegenerative diseases to investigate the dynamic changes of brain anatomy.
