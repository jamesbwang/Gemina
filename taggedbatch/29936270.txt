 The basic characteristics of three low-cost radiation survey meters using multi-pixel photon counters ( MPPC) , the C12137 , T-GMK2-S , and iMetry , were measured. The linearity of the dose rate was confirmed over the full range of each instrument. All the survey meters could obtain gamma-ray energy spectra , with an accuracy within Â± 30 % of the theoretical value. These survey meters are therefore applicable for radiation management.
