 Although abstract thinking is a fundamental dimension of human cognition , it has received scant attention in research on pain and cognition. We hypothesized that physical pain impairs abstraction , because when people experience pain at high intensity levels , attention becomes concretely focused on the self in the here and now , where little else matters than finding relief for the pain they are currently experiencing. We also examined the relationship between pain and self-control , predicting that pain would debilitate self-control. Abstraction and self-reported self-control were assessed in 109 patients with musculoskeletal pain. The influence of specific pain qualities , such as pain intensity , pain interference with daily activities , pain duration , and pain persistence , was examined. Furthermore , we assessed other factors ( e.g. , anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> , and fatigue<symptom>) that could be assumed to play a role in the pain experience and in cognitive performance. Higher pain intensity and persistence were associated with less abstract thinking. Furthermore , self-control decreased with greater pain intensity , persistence , and self-reported pain interference with daily activities. Self-reported depressive symptoms mediated the overall relationship between pain and self-control. Abstraction is compromised in patients reporting higher pain intensity and persistence. Different dimensions of pain also predict lower self-control although depression<symptom> seems to account for the relationship between overall pain and self-control. The current study is the first to report an association between clinical musculoskeletal pain and abstraction. The results suggest that pain patients may suffer from a broader range of cognitive disadvantages than previously believed.
