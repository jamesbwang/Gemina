 The discovery of antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs) has brought tremendous promise and opportunities to overcome the prevalence of bacterial resistance to commonly used antibiotics. However , their widespread use and translation into clinical application is hampered by the moderate<symptom> to severe hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity. Here , we presented and validated a supramolecular platform for the construction of hemo- and cytocompatible AMP-based nanomaterials , termed self-assembling antimicrobial nanofibers ( SAANs). SAANs , the `` nucleus '' of our antimicrobial therapeutic platform , are supramolecular assemblies of de novo designed AMPs that undergo programmed self-assembly into nanostructured fibers to `` punch holes '' in the bacterial membrane , thus killing the bacterial pathogen. In this study , we performed solid-state NMR spectroscopy showing predominant antiparallel Î²-sheet assemblies rather than monomers to interact with liposomes. We investigated the mode of antimicrobial action of SAANs using transmission electron microscopy and provided compelling microscopic evidence that self-assembled nanofibers were physically in contact with bacterial cells causing local membrane deformation and rupture. While effectively killing bacteria , SAANs , owing to their nanoparticulate nature , were found to cross mammalian cell membranes<symptom> harmlessly with greatly reduced membrane accumulation and possess exceptional cytocompatibility and hemocompatibility compared to natural AMPs. Through these systematic investigations , we expect to establish this new paradigm for the customized design of SAANs that will provide exquisite , tunable control of both bactericidal activity and cytocompatibility and can potentially overcome the drawbacks of traditional AMPs.
