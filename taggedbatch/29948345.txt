 It has been reported that many elderly people have low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D<pathogen>) and that serum 25 ( OH) D<pathogen> levels may have a relationship with cognitive function. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between serum 25 ( OH) D<pathogen> levels and cognitive function in a Japanese population. This cross-sectional study was performed as a part of the Project in Sado for Total Health ( PROST). The PROST study evaluated cognitive state and serum vitamin D level from June 2011 to November 2013 for 740 patients ( 431 men and 309 women). The Mini-Mental State Examination-Japanese version ( MMSE-J) and serum 25 ( OH) D<pathogen> level measurements were used as assessment tools. Cognitive impairment was defined using MMSE-J â‰¤ 23 as a cutoff. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate the odds ratios ( ORs) for low MMSE-J scores. The average subject age was 68.1 years , the average MMSE- J score was 25.9 , and the average 25 ( OH) D<pathogen> level was 24.6 ng/mL. Significant ORs for cognitive impairment were observed for both high age and low serum 25 ( OH) D<pathogen>. The adjusted OR for the lowest versus highest serum 25 ( OH) D<pathogen> quartiles was 2.70 ( 95 % confidence interval 1.38-5.28 , P = 0.0110). Low serum 25 ( OH) D<pathogen> levels were independently associated with a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment.
