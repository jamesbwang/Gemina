 The obesity epidemic is accompanied by a worldwide burden of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) that manifests from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH) , possibly evolving into hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC). Although much attention has been focused on NAFLD , its pathogenesis remains largely obscure. The hallmark of NAFLD is the hepatic accumulation of lipids subsequently leading to cellular stress and hepatic injury , which eventually results in chronic liver disease. Abnormal lipid accumulation often coincides with insulin resistance in steatotic livers and is associated with perturbed endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) proteostasis in hepatocytes. In response to chronic ER stress , an adaptive signaling pathway known as the Unfolded Protein Response ( UPR) is triggered initially to restore ER proteostasis. The UPR can be accountable for inflammation<symptom> , inflammasome activation and , in the case of non-resolvable ER stress , for the death of hepatocytes. Experimental data suggest that the UPR influences hepatic tumor development , aggressiveness and response to treatment , offering novel therapeutic avenues. Herein , we provide an overview of the evidence linking ER stress to NAFLD and discuss possible points of intervention.
