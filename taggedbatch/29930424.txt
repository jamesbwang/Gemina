 To investigate the correlation between matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP) -2/ MMP-9 levels and childhood caries<disease> , and the saliva levels of MMP-2/ MMP-9 among healthy children and those with different degrees of dental<disease> caries<disease> , both before and after treatment. In the study , 368 children aged 3 to 5 years were separated into three groups: severe caries<disease> group ( 112 children) , mild caries<disease> group ( 98 children) and caries<disease> free group ( 158 children). The children with severe caries<disease> were included in treatment group ( 83 children) after accepting a comprehensive treatment of caries<disease>. MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) and the data were analyzed by the Statistics Package for Social Science ( SPSS 13.0). The differences among severe caries<disease> group , mild caries<disease> group and caries<disease> free group were analyzed by SNK-q ( Student Newman Keuls). The severe caries<disease> group and treatment group were compared by paired t test. The differences between each group were statistically analyzed. There was no significant difference of the age and gender composition among severe caries<disease> group , mild caries<disease> group , caries<disease> free group and treatment group. The MMP-2 level of severe caries<disease> group ( ( 141.3 ± 32.5) μg/L) was higher than those of mild caries<disease> group ( ( 107.5 ± 21.3) μg/L) and caries<disease> free group ( ( 102.8 ± 18.5) μg/L) ( P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between mild caries<disease> and caries<disease> free group ( P > 0.05). After analysis of 83 children in the treatment group , the level of MMP-2 ( ( 120.1 ± 24.8) μg/L) was lower than before ( ( 144.6 ± 30.3) μg/L) ( P < 0.05) , but was higher than that of caries<disease> free group ( P < 0.05). The MMP-9 levels of severe caries<disease> group ( ( 445.8 ± 68.1) μg/L) and mild caries<disease> group ( ( 428.6 ± 59.2) μg/L) were higher than that of caries<disease> free group ( ( 385.4 ± 60.6) μg/L) ( P < 0.05) , but the difference between severe caries<disease> group and mild caries<disease> group was not significant ( P > 0.05). After analysis of 83 children in the treatment group , the alteration of MMP-9 ( ( 432.2 ± 64.7) μg/L) was not significant either ( P > 0.05). The saliva levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in children with severe caries<disease> were higher than those in caries<disease> free children , even if the treatment was implemented , which suggests that the MMP-2 and MMP-9 in saliva might be related to the caries<disease> in children.
