 Globally , one in five men over 50 years of age is predicted to experience an osteoporotic fracture. Because of the treatment gap in osteoporosis and paucity of bone-forming agents for men , there is need for new osteoporosis treatments. Evaluate the safety and efficacy of romosozumab in men with osteoporosis. Phase 3 randomized placeBo-contRolled double-blind study evaluatIng the efficacy anD safety of romosozumab in treatinG mEn with osteoporosis ( BRIDGE; NCT02186171) for 12 months. 31 centers in Europe , Latin America , Japan , and North<pathogen> America. Men aged 55-90 years with baseline BMD T-score at the lumbar spine ( LS) , total hip ( TH) , or femoral neck ≤ -2.5 or ≤ -1.5 with a history of fragility nonvertebral or vertebral fracture. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive romosozumab 210 mg SC QM or placebo for 12 months. Primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change from baseline in LS BMD at month 12. In 245 subjects ( 163 romosozumab , 82 placebo) , at month 12 , mean percentage change from baseline in LS and TH BMD was significantly higher for romosozumab than placebo ( LS: 12.1 % vs 1.2 % , TH: 2.5 % vs -0.5 %; P < 0.001). Adverse events and serious adverse events were balanced between groups , with a numerical imbalance in positively adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events ( romosozumab 8 ( 4.9 %) vs placebo 2 ( 2.5 %)). Treatment with romosozumab for 12 months increased spine and hip BMD compared with placebo and was well tolerated in men with osteoporosis.
