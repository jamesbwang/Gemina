 Small hive<disease> beetle ( SHB) , Aethina tumida can feed on honey , pollen and brood in honey bee colonies. It was endemic to Africa , but since 1996 has been detected in a number of countries worldwide , including Australia , Brazil , Canada , Italy , Mexico , South Korea , Philippines and the USA where it has had economic effects on local apiculture. To improve SHB identification , we obtained the first reference sequences from the DNA barcoding 5 ' COI gene region for SHB and some species of the family Nitidulidae associated with beehives. Phylogenetic analysis of SHB COI sequences ( 3 ' COI) revealed two divergent lineages , with those from Australia and USA being genetically different from the recent detection in Italy. Many countries , including New Zealand , are currently free from SHB , and require a rapid detection method for biosecurity. Here we present the development and validation of a real-time PCR assay for detection of SHB. The assay showed high specificity and sensitivity for detecting SHB , with no cross-reaction observed with closely related species , such as A. concolor. The real-time PCR is sensitive , detecting the target sequences up to 100 copies/ÂµL. This assay should prove a useful biosecurity tool for rapid detection of SHB worldwide.
