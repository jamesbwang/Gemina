 The remarkable progress made in confronting the global HIV<pathogen> epidemic offers a unique opportunity to address the increasing threat of noncommunicable diseases ( NCDs). However , questions remain about how to enhance the HIV<pathogen> platforms to deliver integrated HIV<pathogen> and NCD care to people living with HIV<pathogen> ( PLHIV) in sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA). We aimed to develop a priority research agenda to advance this effort. Researchers , policymakers , and implementers from the United States and SSA conducted three scoping reviews on HIV/NCD prevention and care focused on clinical , health system , and community levels. Based on the review findings and expert inputs , we conducted iterative consensus-development activities to generate a prioritized research agenda. Population-level data on NCD prevalence among PLHIV in SSA are sparse. The review identified NCD screening and management approaches that could be integrated into HIV<pathogen> programs in SSA. However , few studies focused on the effectiveness , cost , and best practices for integrated chronic care platforms , making it difficult to derive policy recommendations. To address these gaps , we propose a prioritized research agenda focused on developing evidence-based service delivery models , increasing human capacity through workforce education , generating data through informatics platforms and research , managing the medication supply chain , developing new financing and sustainability models , advancing research-informed policy , and addressing other crosscutting health system issues. Based on collaborative , interdisciplinary efforts , a research agenda was developed to provide guidance that advances efforts to adapt the current health system to deliver integrated chronic care for PLHIV and the population at large.
