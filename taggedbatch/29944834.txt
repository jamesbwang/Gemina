 We propose a new independent thermometry method , line strength ratio thermometry ( LRT) , based on optical spectroscopy measurement of the line strength intensity ratio R between pairs of molecular transitions. Due to strong dependence of R on kT , a given measurement uncertainty Î´R for R reflects in a small uncertainty of kT determination. By assuming experimental uncertainties of R and T to be those reported in literature , we foresee a k determination at the 5 ppm level , which is better than the most precise k determination by using Doppler broadening thermometry ( DBT). In the frame of a new definition of the SI Kelvin unit , based on k as fixed constant , once the k constant is exactly established , LRT is proposed as a high resolution noncontact thermometry technique for absolute temperature measurements of gas samples at the ppm level.
