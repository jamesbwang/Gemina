 Nuclear proteins participate in diverse cellular processes , many of which are essential for cell survival and viability. To maintain optimal nuclear physiology , the cell employs the ubiquitin-proteasome system to eliminate damaged and misfolded proteins in the nucleus that could otherwise harm the cell. In this review , we highlight the current knowledge about the major ubiquitin-protein ligases involved in protein quality control degradation ( PQCD) in the nucleus and how they orchestrate their functions to eliminate misfolded proteins in different nuclear subcompartments. Many human disorders are causally linked to protein misfolding in the nucleus , hence we discuss major concepts that still need to be clarified to better understand the basis of the nuclear misfolded proteins ' toxic effects. Additionally , we touch upon potential strategies for manipulating nuclear PQCD pathways to ameliorate diseases associated with protein misfolding and aggregation in the nucleus.
