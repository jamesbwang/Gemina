 Three distinct four-component supramolecular nanorotors , prepared by varying the rotator 's structure and keeping all other components constant , exhibit rotational frequencies that differ by almost 2 orders of magnitude. When the rotors were used as catalyst for two click reactions , the product yield correlated with the speed of the machine , e.g. , 20 % at 0.50 kHz , 44 % at 20 kHz and 62 % at 42 kHz. The kinetic effect on the product yield is attributed to the ability of the rotating catalysts to displace the product more efficiently from the active site at higher speed ( anchimeric assistance). This mechanistic hypothesis was convincingly corroborated by a linear correlation between product yield and product liberation.
