 Porphyria cutanea tarda<pathogen> ( PCT) is a cutaneous porphyria that presents later in life with cutaneous findings in sun-exposed sites. We report a complex case of PCT in a 67-year-old woman with an unusual constellation of cutaneous findings: scleroderma , acquired ichthyosis , and nonscarring alopecia. Possible triggers for her PCT include tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer and carrier status of the hemochromatosis gene. High-dose chloroquine was used to successfully achieve clinical remission and normalize her uroporphyrins. While on chloroquine she developed extensive classic vitiligo. It is not clear if this is another feature of her complex and unusual PCT , or a consequence of her antimalarial therapy.
