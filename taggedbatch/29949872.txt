 Human cancers are characterized by deregulated expression of multiple microRNAs ( miRNAs) , involved in essential pathways that confer the malignant cells their tumorigenic potential. Each miRNA can regulate hundreds of messenger RNAs ( mRNAs) , while various miRNAs can control the same mRNA. Additionally , many miRNAs regulate and are regulated by other species of non-coding RNAs , such as circular RNAs ( circRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs). For this reason , it is extremely difficult to predict , study , and analyze the precise role of a single miRNA involved in human cancer , considering the complexity of its connections. Focusing on a single miRNA molecule represents a limited approach. Additional information could come from network analysis , which has become a common tool in the biological field to better understand molecular interactions. In this review , we focus on the main types of networks ( monopartite , association networks and bipartite) used for analyzing biological data related to miRNA function. We briefly present the important steps to take when generating networks , illustrating the theory with published examples and with future perspectives of how this approach can help to better select miRNAs that can be therapeutically targeted in cancer.
