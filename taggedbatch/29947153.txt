 Entrapment of living cells into a polymer network has significant potential in various fields such as biomass conversion and tissue engineering. A crucial challenge for this strategy is to provide a mild enough condition to preserve cell viability. Here , a facile and cytocompatible method to entrap living yeast cells into a poly ( ethylene glycol) ( PEG) network grafting from polypropylene nonwoven fabrics via visible-light-induced surface living graft crosslinking polymerization is reported. Due to the mild reaction conditions and excellent biocompatibility of PEG , the immobilized yeast cells could maintain their viability and proliferate well. The obtained composite sheet has excellent long-term stability and shows no significant efficiency loss after 25 cycles of repeated batch bioethanol fermentation. The immobilized yeast cells exhibit 18.0 % higher bioethanol fermentation efficiency than free cells. This strategy for immobilization of living cells with high viability has significant potential application.
