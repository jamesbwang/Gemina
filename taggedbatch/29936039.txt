 Cystic echinococcosis ( CE) , a zoonotic disease caused by tapeworms of the species complex Echinococcus granulosus<pathogen> sensu lato , represents a substantial global health and economic burden. Within this complex , E. granulosus sensu stricto ( genotypes G1 and G3) is the most frequent causative agent of human CE. Currently , there is no fully reliable method for assigning samples to genotypes G1 and G3 , as the commonly used mitochondrial cox1 and nad1 genes are not sufficiently consistent for the identification and differentiation of these genotypes. Thus , a new genetic assay is required for the accurate assignment of G1 and G3. Here we use a large dataset of near-complete mtDNA sequences ( n = 303) to reveal the extent of genetic variation of G1 and G3 on a broad geographical scale and to identify reliable informative positions for G1 and G3. Based on extensive sampling and sequencing data , we developed a new method , that is simple and cost-effective , to designate samples to genotypes G1 and G3. We found that the nad5 is the best gene in mtDNA to differentiate between G1 and G3 , and developed new primers for the analysis. Our results also highlight problems related to the commonly used cox1 and nad1. To guarantee consistent identification of G1 and G3 , we suggest using the sequencing of the nad5 gene region ( 680 bp). This region contains six informative positions within a relatively short fragment of the mtDNA , allowing the differentiation of G1 and G3 with confidence. Our method offers clear advantages over the previous ones , providing a significantly more consistent means to distinguish G1 and G3 than the commonly used cox1 and nad1.
