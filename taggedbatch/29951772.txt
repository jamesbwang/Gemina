 Chromogenic salts based on the negatively solvatochromic pyridinium N-phenolate betaines 2,6-diphenyl-4- ( 2,4,6-triphenyl-N-pyridino)- phenolate ( Reichardt 's dye 30) and 2,6-dichloro-4- ( 2,4,6-triphenyl-N-pyridino)- phenolate ( Reichardt 's dye 33) proved to be promising probes for the colorimetric detection of bases , including hydroxide ion , ammonia<pathogen> , and aliphatic amines. Specifically , the protonated halide forms of these two dyes were ion exchanged to generate lipophilic bis ( trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide derivatives , denoted ( E
