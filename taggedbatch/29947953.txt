 After initial up-regulation , expression of TUBG1 and TUBG2 is significantly down-regulated in mature syncytia , but lack of expression of either of γ-tubulin genes reduces numbers of nematode infections and developing females. Infective second stage juveniles of sedentary plant parasitic nematode Heterodera schachtii invade the root vascular tissue and induce a feeding site , named syncytium , formed as a result of cell hypertrophy and partial cell wall dissolution leading to a multinucleate state. Syncytium formation and maintenance involves a molecular interplay between the plant host and the developing juveniles leading to rearrangements and fragmentation of the plant cytoskeleton. In this study , we investigated the role of two Arabidopsis γ-tubulin genes ( TUBG1 and TUBG2) , involved in MTs nucleation during syncytium development. Expression analysis revealed that both γ-tubulin 's transcript levels changed during syncytium development and after initial up-regulation ( 1-3 dpi) they were significantly down-regulated in 7 , 10 and 15 dpi syncytia. Moreover , TUBG1 and TUBG2 showed distinct immunolocalization patterns in uninfected roots and syncytia. Although no severe<symptom> changes<symptom> in syncytium anatomy and ultrastructure in tubg1-1 and tubg2-1 mutants were observed compared to syncytia induced in wild-type plants , nematode infection assays revealed reduced numbers of infecting juveniles and developed female nematodes in mutant lines. Our results indicate that the expression of both TUBG1 and TUBG2 genes , although generally down-regulated in mature syncytia , is essential for successful root infection , development of functional syncytium and nematode maturation.
