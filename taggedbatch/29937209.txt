 Radiotherapy plays an important role in the management of childhood cancer , with the primary aim of achieving the highest likelihood of cure with the lowest risk of radiation-induced morbidity. Proton therapy ( PT) provides an undisputable advantage by reducing the radiation ` bath ' dose delivered to non-target structures/volume while optimally covering the tumor with tumoricidal dose. This treatment modality comes , however , with an additional costs compared to conventional radiotherapy that could put substantial financial pressure to the health care systems with societal implications. In this review we assess the data available to the oncology community of PT delivered to children with cancer , discuss on the urgency to develop high-quality data. Additionally , we look at the advantage of combining systemic<disease> agents<disease> with protons and look at the cost-effectiveness data published so far.
