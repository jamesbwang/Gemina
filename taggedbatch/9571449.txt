 The purpose of this study was to create a novel The metatarsophalangeal joints of 12 fresh cadaveric bovine feet were skinned and dissected aseptically , and cultured for up to four weeks. Dynamic movement was applied using a custom-made machine on six joints , with the others cultured under static conditions. Chondrocyte viability and matrix glycosaminoglycan ( GAG) content were evaluated by the cell viability probes , 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate ( CMFDA) and propidium iodide ( PI) , and dimethylmethylene blue ( DMMB) assay , respectively. Chondrocyte viability in the static model decreased significantly from 89.9 % ( sd 2.5 %) ( Day 0) to 66.5 % ( sd 13.1 %) ( Day 28) , 94.7 % ( sd 1.1 %) to 80. 9 % ( sd 5.8 %) and 80.1 % ( sd 3.0 %) to 46.9 % ( sd 8.5 %) in the superficial quarter , central half and deep quarter of cartilage , respectively ( p < 0.001 in each zone; one-way analysis of variance). The GAG content decreased significantly from 6.01 μg/mg ( sd 0.06) ( Day 0) to 4.71 μg/mg ( sd 0.06) ( Day 28) ( p < 0.001; one-way analysis of variance). However , with dynamic movement , chondrocyte viability and GAG content were maintained at the Day 0 level over the four-week period without a significant change ( chondrocyte viability: 92.0 % ( sd 4.0 %) ( Day 0) to 89.9 % ( sd 0.2 %) ( Day 28) , 93.1 % ( sd 1.5 %) to 93.8 % ( sd 0.9 %) and 85.6 % ( sd 0.8 %) to 84.0 % ( sd 2.9 %) in the three corresponding zones; GAG content: 6.18 μg/mg ( sd 0.15) ( Day 0) to 6.06 μg/mg ( sd 0.09) ( Day 28)). Dynamic joint movement maintained chondrocyte viability and cartilage GAG content. This long-term whole joint culture model could be of value in providing a more natural and controlled platform for investigating the influence of joint movement on articular cartilage , and for evaluating novel therapies for cartilage repair.
