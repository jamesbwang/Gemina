 To establish a method for the age estimation of adult living donor based on pubic MSCT three-dimensional reconstruction and verify its accuracy and reliability. The volume rendering （ VR ） image data of pubic symphysis surface were collected from 300 volunteers aged over 17 years old. According to different age groups , the age estimation of these volunteers was performed by the method and formula of pubic symphysis surface. In the 300 volunteers , the difference between biological age and actual age was < 1 year in 117 cases , > 1-2 years in 178 cases , > 2 years in 5 cases. MSCT three-dimensional reconstruction technology of pubic symphysis surface can be used to estimate the age of adult living donor , which can provide a high accurate and reliable result.
