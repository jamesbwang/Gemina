 Previous studies indicated that single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) of genes coding for toll-like receptors ( TLRs) and toll-interacting protein ( TOLLIP) may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary tuberculosis<disease> ( PTB). This study was designed to investigate potential associations between the polymorphisms in TLR2 , TLR4 , and TOLLIP and susceptibility to latent tuberculosis<disease> infection ( LTBI) or subsequent PTB in a Chinese Han population. A total of 209 PTB and 201 LTBI patients and 204 healthy control subjects ( HCS) were enrolled in our study. We performed a logistic regression including sex and age as covariates to test the effect of genotype. Genotyping was conducted using the improved multiplex ligase detection reaction ( iMLDR). Eleven markers in TLR2 , TLR4 , and TOLLIP were assessed. No significant association between polymorphisms of TLR2 and TLR4 with PTB or LTBI was detected. For TOLLIP , rs5743899 ( p = 0.005 , OR = 1.83 , 95 % CI: 1.20-2.80) CC genotype were risk factors for PTB progression. Moreover , rs5743867 under addictive ( p = 0.005 , OR = 1.54 , 95 % CI: 1.14-2.07) and recessive model ( p = 0.004 , OR = 1.86 , 95 % CI: 1.22-2.83) were also risk factors for PTB susceptibility. Our results indicate that polymorphisms in TOLLIP affected the risk of PTB disease.
