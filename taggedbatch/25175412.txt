 The detection of irregular antibody is a critical issue in the management of red blood cell transfusion according to the Type & Screen ( T&S) practice. In order to implement the T&S procedure at our blood bank , we compared three different automated analyzers based on column agglutination technique ( CAT) or solid phase red cell adherence assay ( SPACA) methods. Pre-transfusion antibody screening was performed in 986 patients candidate to elective surgery at low risk for red blood cell transfusion. We tested the following kits: the three-cell panel micro-CAT system ID-DiaCell I-II-III ( DiaMed) , the four-cell panel solid-phase system Capture-R Ready Screen-4 ( Immucor) , and the four-cell panel micro-CAT system Serascan Diana-4 ( Grifols). Positive results were further investigated using corresponding identification panels , and discrepant results were investigated with all the antibody identification systems. Among 986 samples , we observed 967 concordant negative results ( 98.1 %) , 8 concordant positive results ( 0.8 % of cases) , and 11 discrepant results ( 1.1 %). Among discrepant samples , an alloantibody could been identified in two patents ( anti-M , detected by Serascan Diana-4 and ID-DiaCell I , II , III; anti-Kp Among the evaluated technologies , the four-cell panel micro-CAT system displayed the highest sensitivity and specificity with an optimal negative predictive value. These features might be relevant to the routine implementation of the T&S transfusion strategy.
