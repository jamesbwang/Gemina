 Assays detecting CMV-specific cell-mediated immunity ( CMI) may support the current management of CMV infection in solid-organ transplant ( SOT) recipients , by allowing a better risk assessment and adjusting antiviral treatment. The primary endpoint was the performance of two tests measuring CMV-specific interferon-gamma production , both approved for commercial use in clinical settings. Secondarily , we determined a cut-off for the cellular immune response , which protects against CMV reactivation/infection. Thirty kidney transplant ( KTx) patients were stratified according to their CMV-IgG status pre-transplantation ( Tx) and were divided into two groups: pre-emptive ( donor-/ recipient + , donor +/ recipient +) and prophylaxis ( donor +/ recipient-). An ELISpot ( T-Track-CMV) was performed at month 1 post-Tx ( pre-emptive group) and end of prophylaxis and one month thereafter ( prophylaxis group). An ELISA ( QuantiFERON-CMV) was performed every 2-4 weeks ( pre-emptive) or monthly ( prophylaxis) , in parallel to the CMV viral load ( PCR). A good positive agreement was obtained between the QuantiFERON-CMV or T-Track-CMV and the CMV-IgG ( kappa = 0.839 and 0.824 , respectively). A cut-off of 19.5 spot forming units ( SFU)/ 200,000 lymphocytes for the T-Track-CMV IE-1 ( AUC = 0.802 , sensitivity 45 % , specificity 100 %) and 495 SFU/200 ,000 lymphocytes for the T-Track-CMV pp65 ( AUC = 0.617 , sensitivity 11 % , specificity 100 %) was defined to assess protection against reactivation. The QuantiFERON-CMV performed modestly ( AUC = 0.477 , cut-off 85.1 IU/ml). The QuantiFERON-CMV and T-Track-CMV enable the functional assessment of CMV-specific CMI in KTx recipients. In combination with CMV viral load monitoring , T-Track-CMV results could stratify patients at risk of CMV reactivation/infection.
