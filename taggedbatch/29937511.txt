 One-hundred and sixty-eight aqueous and organic extracts of 42 selected bryophyte species were screened in vitro for antiproliferative activity on a panel of human gynecological cancer cell lines containing HeLa ( cervix epithelial adenocarcinoma) , A2780 ( ovarian carcinoma) , and T47D ( invasive ductal breast carcinoma) cells using the 3- ( 4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT) assay and for antibacterial activity on 11 strains using the disc-diffusion method. A total of 99 extracts derived from 41 species exerted & ge; 25 % inhibition of proliferation of at least one of the cancer cell lines at 10 & mu; g/mL. In the cases of
