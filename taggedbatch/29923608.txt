 More frequently occurring drought waves call for a deeper understanding of tree hydraulics and fast and easily applicable methods to measure drought stress. The aim of this study was to establish empirical relationships between the percent loss of hydraulic conductivity ( PLC) and the relative water loss ( RWL) in woody stem axes with different P
