 The aim of this study was to improve the oral bioavailability of a practically insoluble drug , efonidipine hydrochloride ( EFH) , by agglomeration in acid solution/gastric fluid. The EFH nanosuspension was prepared by the wet-milling method with F68 as a dispersing agent , SDS as an auxiliary stabilizer and l-arginine as a pH adjusting agent. The EFH nanosuspension have been prepared in industrial scale-up. The dissolution rate of the EFH nanosuspension was greater than that of bulk EFH. An in vitro intestinal permeability study showed a clear increase in the apparent permeability of different intestinal segments compared with bulk EFH. Also , a pharmacokinetic study showed that the C
