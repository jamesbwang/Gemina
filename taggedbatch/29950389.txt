 Mammary glands develop through primary ductal elongation and side branching to maximize the spatial area. Although primary ducts are generated by bifurcation of terminal end buds , the mechanism through which side branching occurs is still largely unclear. Here , we show that inhibitor of DNA-binding 2 ( ID2) drives side branch formation through the differentiation of K6
