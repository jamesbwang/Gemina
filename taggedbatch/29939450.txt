 The preparation of allylic amines is traditionally accomplished by reactions of amines with reactive electrophiles , such as allylic halides , sulfonates , or oxyphosphonium species; such methods involve hazardous reagents , generate stoichiometric waste streams , and often suffer from side reactions ( such as overalkylation). We report here the first broad-scope nickel-catalysed direct amination of allyl alcohols: An inexpensive Ni
