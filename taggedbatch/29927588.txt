 The controlled preparation of higher order oligopyrrolic species holds broad utility across the chemical and material sciences. Here , we describe the gram-scale synthesis of a bench-stable 5,5 â€³- unsubstituted terpyrrole in excellent yield via a tandem Suzuki cross-coupling with in situ deprotection. The solution and solid-state stability as well as UV-vis , fluorescence , and single crystal X-ray diffraction structure are also detailed.
