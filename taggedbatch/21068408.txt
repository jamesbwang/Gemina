 Efficient clearance of apoptotic cells by efferocytosis is important for tissue homeostasis. Impaired efferocytosis leads to the accumulation of cell debris , which is regarded as a trigger in chronic inflammation<symptom> and autoimmune diseases. Patients with hematological neoplastic disorders such as multiple myeloma ( MM) exhibit high blood levels of apoptotic microparticles. The present study investigated whether these high levels of apoptotic microparticles are associated with insufficient dead cell clearance. Blood samples were collected from patients with MM immediately prior to and 3 , 7 and 10 days after the initial cycle of bortezomib-based therapy. In addition , bone<disease> marrow aspirates ( BMA) were collected prior to and following therapy. Prior to therapy , a 52 % reduction in efferocytosis by blood monocytes was observed compared with the healthy controls ( P < 0.017). This was associated with an elevated number of 7-AAD
