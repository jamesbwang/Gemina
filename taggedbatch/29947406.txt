 Catalytic alkylation reactions of weakly acidic carbonyl and related pronucleophiles such as amides , esters , and sulfonamides with substituted alkenes have been reported. In the presence of a strong Br√∏nsted base catalyst system , potassium hexamethyldisilazide and 18-crown-6 ether , the desired reactions proceeded in high yields at ambient temperature with a wide substrate scope. These are atom-economical catalytic alkylation reactions of carbonyl and related compounds.
