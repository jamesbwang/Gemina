 We investigated whether a wearable system based on a commercial Inertial Measurement Unit ( IMU) can reliably provide the main spatiotemporal gait parameters in subjects with Parkinson 's disease ( PD) , compared to a gold-standard optoelectronic motion capture system. The gait of 22 subjects with PD ( Age: 69.4 ( 6.1) years; UPDRS-III: 28.0 ( 9.2)) was recorded simultaneously with an optoelectronic system and a commercial IMU-based wearable system. Eight spatiotemporal parameters describing the step cycle ( cadence , velocity , stride length , stride duration , step length , stance , swing and double support duration) were compared between the two systems. The IMU and the optical system reported comparable gait parameters , with the exception of walking velocity ( optical system , 0.72 ( 0.27) m âˆ™ s
