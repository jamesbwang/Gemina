 Intervertebral disk ( IVD) lesion<symptom> and its subsequent degeneration have a profound effect on the multifidus muscle. The subacute/early chronic phase of multifidus remodeling after IVD lesion<symptom> has been proposed to be regulated by inflammatory processes. The balance<symptom> between pro-inflammatory ( M1) and anti-inflammatory ( M2) macrophages plays an important role in maintaining tissue integrity after injury. The localization , polarization of macrophage subtypes and their mediation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF) are unknown in paraspinal muscles during IVD degeneration. A sheep model of IVD degeneration was used to investigate the role of macrophages and TNF in the structural alterations that occur within the multifidus muscle. Anterolateral lesions<symptom> were induced at L3-4 IVD in sheep. Multifidus muscle tissue at L4 was harvested 3 and 6 months after lesion<symptom> and used for immunofluorescence assays to examine total macrophage number , macrophage polarization between M1 and M2 , and to assess the localization of TNF expression in muscle , adipose and connective tissues from injured and na√Øve control animals. A greater proportion of M1 macrophages is present in muscle at both 3 and 6 months after IVD lesion<symptom> , and adipose tissue at 6 months. Total number of macrophages is unchanged. At 6 months , expression of TNF is increased in adipose and connective tissue and the proportion of TNF expressed by M1 macrophages is increased. These data support the proposal that macrophages and TNF ( pro-inflammatory cytokine) play an active role in the subacute/early chronic phase of remodeling in muscle , adipose and connective tissues of the multifidus during IVD degeneration. This presents a novel target for treatment. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.
