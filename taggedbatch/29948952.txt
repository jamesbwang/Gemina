 Glioblastoma is an extremely aggressive and deadly brain tumor known for its striking cellular heterogeneity and capability to communicate with microenvironment components , such as microglia. Microglia-glioblastoma interaction contributes to an increase in tumor invasiveness , and Wnt signaling pathway is one of the main cascades related to tumor progression through changes in cell migration and invasion. However , very little is known about the role of canonical Wnt signaling during microglia-glioblastoma crosstalk. Here , we show for the first time that Wnt3a is one of the factors that regulate interactions between microglia and glioblastoma cells. Wnt3a activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling of both glioblastoma and microglial cells. Glioblastoma-conditioned medium not only induces nuclear translocation of microglial β-catenin but also increases microglia viability and proliferation as well as Wnt3a , cyclin-D1 , and c-myc expression. Moreover , glioblastoma-derived Wnt3a increases microglial ARG-1 and STI1 expression , followed by an upregulation of IL-10 mRNA levels , and a decrease in IL1β gene expression. The presence of Wnt3a in microglia-glioblastoma co-cultures increases the formation of membrane nanotubes accompanied by changes in migration capability. In vivo , tumors formed from Wnt3a-stimulated glioblastoma cells presented greater microglial infiltration and more aggressive characteristics such as growth rate than untreated tumors. Thus , we propose that Wnt3a belongs to the arsenal of factors capable of stimulating the induction of M2-like phenotype on microglial cells , which contributes to the poor prognostic of glioblastoma , reinforcing that Wnt/β-catenin pathway can be a potential therapeutic target to attenuate glioblastoma progression.
