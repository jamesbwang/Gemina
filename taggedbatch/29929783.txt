 REGN3470-3471-3479 is a co-formulated cocktail of three human monoclonal antibodies targeting three non-overlapping epitopes on Ebola<disease> virus. We investigated safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and anti-drug antibodies in healthy adults. This randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , dose-escalation study was done at a phase 1 unit in the USA. Healthy adults , aged 18-60 years , with a body-mass index of 18 · 0-30 · 0 kg/m Between May 18 , 2016 , and October 27 , 2016 , 70 adults were screened and 24 participants were enrolled in the study. 18 participants were assigned to and received REGN3470-3471-3479 , and six participants were assigned to and received placebo as a single intravenous infusion. 19 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in the combined REGN3470-3471-3479 treatment groups , and four treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in combined placebo groups. Adverse events were transient and mild-to-moderate in severity. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was headache<symptom> ( six ( 33 %) of 18 participants in the combined REGN3470-3471-3479 group vs none of six participants in the placebo group. Headaches<symptom> were mild-to-moderate in severity , with onset between 2 h and 27 days after start of study drug infusion. There were no deaths , serious adverse events , or adverse events that led to study discontinuation. The pharmacokinetics of each antibody was linear , with mean half-lives of 27 · 3 days for REGN3471 , 21 · 7 days for REGN3470 , and 23 · 3 days for REGN3479. No participants tested positive for anti-REGN3470 , anti-REGN3471 , or anti-REGN3479 antibodies. REGN3470-3471-3479 was well tolerated , displayed linear pharmacokinetics , and did not lead to detectable immunogenicity. These data support further clinical development of REGN3470-3471-3479 as a single-dose therapeutic drug for acute Ebola<disease> virus infection.
