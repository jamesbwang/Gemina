 In 2012 , antiretroviral ( ARV) treatment guidelines expanded indications and recommended antiretroviral treatment for all HIV-infected persons in the United States , regardless of CD4 cell count. This analysis describes ARV prescriptions among commercially insured HIV-infected adults from 2012 to 2014. We analyzed persons aged 18-64 years from 2012 to 2014 Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Â® database. We identified HIV-infected persons who had at least one inpatient or two outpatient medical claims and identified pharmacy claims using National Drug Codes. We calculated changes over time in ARV prescription and performed a multivariable regression analysis to examine differences in ARV prescriptions by age , sex , and geographic region. We identified 29,419 HIV-infected persons in 2012 , 26,380 in 2013 , and 25,414 in 2014. Overall percentage with ARV prescription increased by 7.3 %. There was a 23 % increase in ARV prescriptions among people new to care and a 6 % increase among people already established in care. In 2014 , more persons who were new to HIV<pathogen> care did not have an ARV prescription compared to persons established in HIV<pathogen> care ( 37.5 % vs 19.3 % , respectively; p < 0.001). The percentage of persons without an ARV prescription was highest for persons residing in the Northeast ( 30.8 %) compared to those residing in the West<disease> ( 21.7 %) , North Central ( 15.9 %) and South ( 16.5 %) and was higher among women ( 26.2 %) compared to men ( 19.5 %) ( p < 0.001). Uptake of ARV medication has increased since the guidelines expanded their indications in 2012. Despite improvements from 2012 to 2014 , a significant proportion of HIV-infected adults with a commercial health insurance plan were not prescribed ARV medications. Insurance-based strategies could be a novel method to increase the percentage of HIV-infected adults who receive optimal care in the United States.
