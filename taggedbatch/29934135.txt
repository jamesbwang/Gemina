 With accumulating evidence and improved outcomes along with recognition that modern biological therapies are not universally effective , require chronic administration and have high acquisition costs , hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT) has become an emerging direction for cell therapy in autoimmune diseases ( ADs). The goal of this therapy is to induce medication-free remissions by resetting the immune system into a na√Øve and self-tolerant state through eradication of the autoreactive immunologic memory and profound re-configuration of the immune system induced by the transplant procedure. Safety of HSCT has generally improved by implementing internal quality management and external accreditation. Inter-disciplinary guidelines for patient selection , transplant technique and supportive care along with greater center experience should optimize safe and appropriate delivery of HSCT in specific ADs. In this review , we discuss the current role and future perspectives of HSCT in AD , focusing on recent published clinical and scientific studies and recommendations in the field.
