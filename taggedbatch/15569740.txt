 Carotid artery pseudoaneurysm results mostly from direct trauma , prior endarterectomy , prior dissection , radiation , and infections. There are many different surgical and endovascular treatment options for repair , and the choice of treatment depends on patient- , surgeon- , and institute-related factors. Studies have reported the efficacy of various endovascular techniques for aneurysm<disease> repair , including stent graft placement and coil embolization , with promising short- and long-term outcomes. In this report , we describe two cases of carotid artery pseudoaneurysm ( after trauma and after carotid endarterectomy) treated successfully through transcarotid artery stenting using the flow reversal technique to minimize the risk of embolization and stroke.
