 This paper presents a software platform to compute the total water level , one of the key variables for the environmental management of coastal zones. The platform integrates six modules: ( 1) simulation of deep-water wave variables , storm surge and river flow; ( 2) wave downscaling; ( 3) wave propagation; ( 4) contribution of the river discharge; ( 5) astronomical tide; and ( 6) total water level. It was applied to three case studies in southern Spain. The first case study consisted of designing the extension of a fluvial marina in a highly dynamic area ( Guadalete estuary , Cádiz) , and the maximum number of floating docks to avoid flooding events was obtained. The second case study involved calculating the operation conditions for navigation purposes in an inlet with sedimentation problems ( Punta Umbría , Huelva) , and a relationship between the percentage of operation hours and the dredged volume was obtained. The third case study consisted of estimating the number of overwash events as a function of the height of the berm on a deltaic beach with erosion issues ( Guadalfeo , Granada) , and a simple design curve to help managers during the decision-making process of artificial nourishment projects was provided. These results highlight the potential of the developed software , whose methodology is feasibly extensible to other coastal areas worldwide , to help managers handle a wide range of environmental problems related to the total water level. This is especially relevant due to the expected sea level rise in the coming years.
