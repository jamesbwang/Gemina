 The importance of vaccine on public health is related to the herd protection related to the levels of vaccine coverage , which directly influences the vaccinated individuals as well as the unvaccinated community. Reaching the level of herd protection by increasing vaccine coverage is the basic strategy to eradicate related infectious<disease> diseases<disease>. Again , herd protection has played an important role in public health practices. With the increasing interests in estimating the vaccine herd protection , we however , have seen only few relevant papers including observational population-based and cluster-randomized clinical trials reported in China. We hope to discuss the study designs for evaluating the vaccine herd protection in order to generate evidence-based related research in this field.
