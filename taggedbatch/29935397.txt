 The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ellagic acid ( EA) on arsenic-induced renal and hepatic toxicity in rats. A total number of 35 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five experimental groups. Group 1 received normal saline ( po). Group 2 received sodium arsenite ( SA , 10 mg/kg , po) for 21 days. Group 3 received EA ( 30 mg/kg , po) for 14 days. Groups 4 and 5 received SA 7 days prior to EA ( 10 and 30 mg/kg respectively) treatment and continued up to 21 days simultaneous with SA administration. Various biochemical , histological and molecular biomarkers were measured in kidney and liver. Treatment with EA ( more potently at dose of 30 mg/kg) restored the SA-induced alterations in serum creatinine ( Cr) and blood urine nitrogen ( BUN) levels as well as the changes in aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) concentrations ( all p < 0.001). Elevated levels of malondialdehyde ( MDA) and nitric oxide ( NO) in renal and hepatic tissue was reduced by EA treatment ( all p < 0.001). Treatment with EA enhanced the glutathione ( GSH) content in liver ( p < 0.001) and up-regulated renal and hepatic superoxide dismutase ( SOD) and glutathione peroxidase ( GPx) mRNA expression ( all p < 0.001). The SA-induced histopathological alterations in kidney and liver were reduced by EA treatment. In conclusion , the presence of EA with SA alleviated its toxic effects and EA treatment might be an effective strategy for the management of arsenic-induced renal and hepatic damage.
