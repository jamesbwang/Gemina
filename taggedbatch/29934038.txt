 We describe a modified string technique for ring removal from an edematous finger , a critical step in the initial treatment of a patient with upper-extremity trauma. This technique involves multiple sutures looped around the ring to provide differential tension on the ring as it is advanced distally over a lubricated digit. With the use of an assistant , the ring can be advanced in caterpillar fashion without sliding back proximal when the direct pressure is released as a result of edema<symptom>. This multisuture technique adds to the armamentarium of methods for ring removal in the setting of upper-extremity trauma without reverting to alternate techniques for cutting or shattering the ring.
