 The complexity and delicacy of human brain make it challenging to recapitulate its development , function and disorders. Brain organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs) provide a new tool to model both normal and pathological human brain , and greatly enhance our ability to study brain biology and diseases. Currently , human brain organoids are increasingly used in modeling neurological disorders and relative therapeutic discovery. This review article focuses on recent advances in human brain organoid system and its application in disease modeling. It also discusses the limitations and future perspective of human brain organoids in modeling neurological diseases.
