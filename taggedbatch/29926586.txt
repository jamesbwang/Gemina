 To investigate the effects of dandelion polysaccharide on IL-6/ STAT3 signaling pathway in rats with ulcerative colitis<disease>. Forty SD rats were randomly divided into four groups ( Compared with the normal control group , the level of serum IL-6 in the model group was significantly higher than that in the control group ( Dandelion polysaccharide can decrease the level of IL-6 in rats with ulcerative colitis<disease> , regulate the expression of sIL-6RÎ± and gp130 protein in IL-6/ STAT3 pathway , and then down-regulate the expressions of STAT3 and IL-6 mRNA in intestinal tissue of rats , alleviate the colon inflammation<symptom> state , protect and repair the mucosal tissue. Dandelion polysaccharide plays a role in the treatment of ulcerative colitis<disease>.
