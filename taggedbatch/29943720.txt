 The present study aims to develop a method for rapid diagnosis of malaria<disease> using loop-mediated isothermal amplification ( LAMP) combined with a lateral flow device ( LFD). By adding the biotin-labeled and FAM-labeled loop primers to the LAMP reaction solution , the end product can be visualized on a lateral flow dipstick. The entire procedure takes approximately 42 minutes to complete , LAMP assay exhibited high sensitivity , as the detection limit was 0.01 pg/Î¼L for all five
