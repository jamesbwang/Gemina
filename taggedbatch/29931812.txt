 Maternal obesity ( OB) accounts for the majority of large-for-gestational-age infants , and newborn percent fat ( NB t) correlates strongest with childhood OB. In addition to maternal glucose , fasting triglycerides ( TGs) may contribute , but postprandial triglycerides ( PPTGs) are unstudied. It was hypothesized that fasting TGs and PPTGs are higher in women with OB compared with women with normal weight ( NW) throughout pregnancy , correlate more strongly with NB t than glucose , and may relate to dietary chylomicron TGs. Fasting TGs and PPTGs , free fatty acids , glucose , and insulin were prospectively measured 10 times over 4 hours after a controlled liquid breakfast early ( 14-16 weeks) and later ( 26-28 weeks) in pregnancy in 27 mothers with NW and 27 with OB. NB t was measured by dual x-ray absorptometry. Fasting TGs and PPTGs were already â‰¥ 30 % higher in mothers with OB at 14 to 16 weeks ( P < 0.001) versus mothers with NW. In mothers with OB , a simple 1-hour ( r = 0.71; P < 0.01) or 2-hour ( r = 0.69; P < 0.01) PPTG at 14 to 16 weeks correlated strongest with NB t. In mothers with NW , the increase in TGs from early to later pregnancy correlated strongest with NB t ( r = 0.57; P < 0.01). Maternal glucose did not statistically add to prediction models. These novel data suggest that 1- or 2-hour PPTGs might be a new target for early intervention in pregnancies with OB to prevent excess newborn adiposity and attenuate child OB risk.
