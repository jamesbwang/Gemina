 Restricted repetitive behaviors ( RRB) are one of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder ( ASD). Evidence suggests that higher-order RRB ( H-RRB) are particularly challenging and can negatively impact family functioning ( e.g. , insistence on sameness , following idiosyncratic routines). The study examined the effects of a parent-implemented behavior intervention using a multiple baseline single case experimental design in three young children with ASD. The intervention involved self-management procedures and included principles of pivotal response treatment during which parents provided bids for children to vary from H-RRB and children obtained points for engaging in these other interests and activities. Results showed improvements in child behavior , parent and child affect and interactions , children 's engagement in family activities , and overall parent ratings of RRB.
