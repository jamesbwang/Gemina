 Globally , acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( AHF) remains an ongoing public health issue with its prevalence and mortality increasing in the east and the west<disease>. Effective treatment strategies to stabilize AHF are important to alleviate clinical symptoms and to improve clinical outcomes. However , despite the progress in the management of stable and chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , no single agent has been proven to play a definitive role in the management of AHF. As a consequence , contemporary treatment strategies for patients with AHF vary greatly by region. This manuscript reviews the medical treatment options for AHF , with an emphasis on the differences between the treatment strategies in the USA and Japan. This information would provide a framework for clinicians to evaluate and manage patients with AHF and highlight the remaining questions to improve clinical outcomes.
