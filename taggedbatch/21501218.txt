 Minimally anchored Standard Rating Scales ( SRSs) , which are widely used in medical education , are hampered by suboptimal interrater reliability. Expert-derived frameworks , such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education ( ACGME) Milestones , may be helpful in defining level-specific anchors to use on rating scales. We examined validity evidence for a Milestones-Based Rating Scale ( MBRS) for scoring chart-stimulated recall ( CSR). Two 11-item scoring forms with either an MBRS or SRS were developed. Items and anchors for the MBRS were adapted from the ACGME Internal Medicine Milestones. Six CSR standardized videos were developed. Clinical faculty scored videos using either the MBRS or SRS and following a randomized crossover design. Reliability of the MBRS versus the SRS was compared using intraclass correlation. Twenty-two faculty were recruited for instrument testing. Some participants did not complete scoring , leaving a response rate of 15 faculty ( 7 in the MBRS group and 8 in the SRS group). A total of 529 ratings ( number of items Ã— number of scores) using SRSs and 540 using MBRSs were available. Percent agreement was higher for MBRSs for only 2 of 11 items-use of consultants ( 92 versus 75 , Adding milestones to our rating form resulted in significant , but not substantial , improvement in intraclass correlation coefficient. Improvement was inconsistent across items.
