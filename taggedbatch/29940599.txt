 The alterations of eating behavior are insufficiently recognized in the clinical attention of adults with obesity. The objective of this study was to examine the characteristics of overeating behavior and its association with depression<symptom> , perceived stress , acylated ghrelin , nestafin-1 , and cortisol. This cross-sectional comparative study included 80 participants with obesity and 50 with normal weight. The volunteers completed questionnaires to evaluate symptoms of food addiction ( FA) , obsessive compulsive , binge eating ( BE) , depression<symptom> , and perceived stress. We measured glucose , lipids , acylated ghrelin , nesfatin-1 , and insulin in a fasting blood sample as well as urine cortisol. We compared groups with students t test , and analysis of variance , and tested associations by logistic and multiple regression. By multiple regression , the BE total score was positively associated with the FA ( p < 0.0001) and depression<symptom> total score ( p < 0.0001). By logistic regression , the positive score of FA was associated with ghrelin ( p < 0.02). The perceived stress total score was associated negatively with cortisol ( p < 0.0006). The BE and FA are strongly associated in agreement with the concept that both conditions have overlapping features. Depressive symptoms are associated with symptoms of disordered eating- behavior. FA positive score was associated with ghrelin. BE total score was associated with nesfatin-1.
