 Sorafenib , as a multi-kinase inhibitor , was the first FDA-approved anti- hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) drug. Rhizoma Paridis saponins ( RPS) as natural products have shown antitumor activity through regulation of glycolytic and lipid metabolism which was regarded as the side effect limited the utility of sorafenib. In this research , we tried to use metabolomics to verify the probability of combinatorial treatment of RPS and Sorafenib. As a result , Sorafenib + RPS increased the antitumor effect of sorafenib and RPS in H22 mice. They mitigated the change of liver weight and the increasing levels of AST and ALT in serum , and AFP and MDA in liver tissues , which indicated their liver protective activity. They also up-regulated the activity of NOX and SDH , concentration of ATP , and down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of HIF-1a and concentration of lactate , which suggested they protected against mitochondria damage and inhibited anaerobic glycolysis. Meanwhile , the combination group remarkably down-regulated the concentration of octadecanoic acid and hexadecanoic acid in serum , and tetradecanoic acid in liver tissues compared with model group ( p < 0.05). Relative regulation mechanism included their decreasing mRNA levels of FASN , CPT1 , GLUT1 , Myc , Akt , mTOR and LDHA , and increasing the protein expression of p53 in tumor and liver tissues ( p < 0.05). Furthermore , similar influence can be observed in protein levels of CPT1A , p-PI3K , p-mTOR and p53 in liver tissues and FASN in serum. All of that provided possibility to overcome the intolerance of sorafenib by drug compatibility through protection against mitochondria damage , inhibition of anaerobic glycolysis and suppression of lipid synthesis based on PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
