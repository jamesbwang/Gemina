 Stroke is a debilitating condition which is also the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Despite the benefits and promises shown by numerous neuroprotective agents in animal stroke models , their clinical translation has not been a complete success. Hence , search for treatment options have directed researchers towards utilising stem cells. Mitochondria has a major involvement in the pathophysiology of stroke and a number of other conditions. Stem cells have shown the ability to transfer mitochondria to the damaged cells and to help revive cell energetics in the recipient cell. The present review discusses how stem cells could be employed to protect neurons and mitochondria in stroke and also the various mechanisms involved in neuroprotection.
