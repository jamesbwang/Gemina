 Gastric cancer ( GC) is one of the most prevalent digestive malignancies. MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are involved in multiple cellular processes , including oncogenesis , and miR-592 itself participates in many malignancies; however , its role in GC remains unknown. In this study , we investigated the expression and molecular mechanisms of miR-592 in GC. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed to determine the expression of miR-592 and its putative targets in human tissues and cell lines. Proliferation , migration , and invasion were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 , population doubling time , colony formation , Transwell , and wound-healing assays in transfected GC cells in vitro. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to determine whether miR-592 could directly bind its target. A tumorigenesis assay was used to study whether miR-592 affected GC growth in vivo. Proteins involved in signaling pathways and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) were detected with western blot. The ectopic expression of miR-592 promoted GC proliferation , migration , and invasion in vitro and facilitated tumorigenesis in vivo. Spry2 was a direct target of miR-592 and Spry2 overexpression partially counteracted the effects of miR-592. miR-592 induced the EMT and promoted its progression in GC via the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways by inhibiting Spry2. Overexpression of miR-592 promotes GC proliferation , migration , and invasion and induces the EMT via the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways by inhibiting Spry2 , suggesting a potential therapeutic target for GC.
