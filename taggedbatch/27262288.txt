 Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) is an irregular and often rapid<symptom> heart rate that can increase the risk of stroke , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , and other heart-related complications. Its incidence increases with age and the presence of concomitant heart disease. We present the cases of a 93-year-old woman , an 82-year-old man , and an 87-year-old woman who developed AF tachycardia<symptom>. This report highlights the use of a bisoprolol transdermal patch to treat AF tachycardia<symptom> in 3 adult elderly patients. In this paper , we report an initial treatment strategy using a bisoprolol transdermal patch and show heart rate trends for 24 hours.
