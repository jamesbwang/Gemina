 This study explores self-esteem in suicide among young males with no earlier history of suicide attempt ( s) or treatment in mental health services. The data come from an ongoing psychological autopsy study; 10 cases of young men aged 18 to 30 , were selected to generate a phenomenologically based understanding of the psychological mechanisms and processes involved in the suicidal process. The analyses are based on in-depth interviews with 61 closely connected individuals , as well as suicide notes. We used Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. For these young men , the transition to young adulthood , a period of major life challenges , seemed to be associated with personal defeats. According to their significant others , the deceased seemed to have experienced intolerable discrepancies between their actual performances and their ideal self standards. Four themes emerged from the analysis: ( a) striving to find a viable path to life as an adult man; ( b) experiencing a sense of failure according to own standards; ( c) emotional self-restriction in relationships; and ( d) strong feelings of loneliness and rejection of self. Improved understanding of suicides outside the mental illness paradigm may have important implications for preventive strategies.
