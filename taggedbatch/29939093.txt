 Numerous human<disease> diseases<disease> are associated with abnormal expansion of unstable trinucleotide repeats ( TNRs). TNR instability mechanisms are complex , and remain only partially understood. Small-pool-PCR ( SP-PCR) is the reference method to assess TNR instability. SP-PCR amplifies a low number of DNA molecules and is followed by Southern blot. However , SP-PCR remains expensive and time consuming. Here , we describe an optimized SP-PCR that can be done in a day , which reduces cost and experimental biases: the flash-small-pool PCR ( FSP-PCR). This method consists of a fluorescent PCR on a few DNA molecules , followed by an alkaline gel electrophoresis revealed with a near infra-red detector system. With reduced experimental steps , cost , and time consumption , microsatellite analysis will become more accessible due to FSP-PCR.
