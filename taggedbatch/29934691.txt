 We have previously shown that metallocomplexes can control the growth of Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> , the agent that causes toxoplasmosis<disease>. In order to develop new metallodrugs to treat this disease , we investigated the influence of the coordination of sulfadiazine ( SDZ) , a drug used to treat toxoplasmosis<disease> , on the biological activity of the iron ( III) complex<pathogen> ( Fe ( HBPClNOL) Cl
