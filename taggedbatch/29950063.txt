 With annual Glycyrrhiza uralensis seedlings as experimental material , using `` 3414 '' optimal regression design and applied fertilizer , through the sampling of G. uralensis at harvest , root fresh weight and content of active components were measured in Lanzhou , Bayan Nur city , Chifeng , Jiuquan. Combined with NPK content in soil , potted experiments were used to study the effects of different nitrogen and phosphorus ratios on the dry matter accumulation and accumulation of active components of G. uralensis. The results reported as follows: the optimum fertilizer treatment in Lanzhou , Bayan Nur city , Chifeng , Jiuquan was N ₁ P ₂ K ₁ , N ₂ P ₂ K ₁ , N ₁ P ₁ K ₂ and N ₂ P ₁ K ₂ , respectively. The efforts of single fertilizer on the fresh root weight acted as parabolic type.There was no significant effect of fertilizer treatment on the accumulation of active components of G. uralensis. Furthermore , in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus , the type of fertilizers that restricted the growth of the region was the type of elements with lower content in the soil. The optimal fertilizer usage was in inverse proportion to content of elements in soil. When the content of phosphorus in soil was low , nitrogen fertilizer and potash fertilizer showed positive interaction with phosphorus fertilizer , whereas , they showed negative interaction.
