 Brucellosis<disease> is being increasingly recognized after solid organ transplantation but has not been reported after orthotopic heart transplantation. We present the case of a 51-year-old farmer who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation and was readmitted after 3 months in a severely immunosuppressed state with significant nonspecific complaints. He posed a diagnostic and management dilemma to all disciplines , but finally turned out to be harbouring Brucella infection. He responded well to medical management and was discharged in a stable clinical status. Although rare , brucellosis<disease> should be included in the investigative work up for non-specific symptoms after cardiac transplantation.
