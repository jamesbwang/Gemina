 This study evaluated the protective effects of resveratrol on the prostate development of rats exposed to TCDD. Pregnant rats received TCDD ( 1 Î¼g/kg) at GD15 and/or RES ( 20 mg/kg/day) from GD10 to PND21. Newborn and adult males from Control , TCDD , TCDD + RES and RES groups were euthanized and the prostate was excised. On PND1 , there was a reduction in the number of prostatic buds , AR-positive mesenchymal cells and proliferation index in epithelial and mesenchymal cells in TCDD group , but restored by RES. AhR immunoreactivity was greater in TCDD group than the other groups. On PND90 , there was higher frequency of functional hyperplasia<disease> in the distal area of the prostate acini in TCDD group , but restored by RES. AhRR expression was higher in the TCDD while NRF2 was higher in the TCDD + RES compared to the other groups. Resveratrol was able to reduce the adverse effects of TCDD on prostate development and its long-term repercussions.
