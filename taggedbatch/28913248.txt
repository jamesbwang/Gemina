 We report a case of squamous cell carcinoma manifested as a cutaneous horn. A 92-year-old man was referred to our department for evaluation of a 3-month history of a keratotic cutaneous horn on the left side of his neck. The height of the cutaneous horn was larger than the diameter of erythema at the base. Histopathological examination showed a hyperkeratotic horn developing over a mass of large atypical keratinocytes with large hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei. Based on these findings , a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma was made. A recent study showed that cutaneous horns in association with invasive squamous cell carcinoma had a tendency to have less height than the diameter of the base. In our case , however , the height of the cutaneous horn was larger than the diameter of the base , indicating that invasive squamous cell carcinoma sometimes shows a cutaneous horn that is higher than the diameter of the base. Thus , clinical finding of erythema at the base of the cutaneous horn would be a reliable feature for early detection of squamous cell carcinoma.
