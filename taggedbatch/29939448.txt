 Dehydroalanine ( Dha) and dehydrobutyrine ( Dhb) are remarkably versatile non-canonical amino acids often found in antimicrobial peptides. This work presents the selective modification of Dha and Dhb in antimicrobial peptides through photocatalytic activation of organoborates under the influence of visible light. Ir ( dF ( CF
