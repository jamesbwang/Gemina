 Cisplatin ( CP) , as an anti-neoplastic drug , causes testicular damage. Zataria multiflora Boiss ( ZM) , a medicinal plant , has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ZM against CP-induced testicular toxicity. In this experimental study , thirty-two adult male mice were randomly divided into four groups. The control group received normal saline with oral gavage during 7 days; ZM group received ZM ( 200 mg/kg) during 7 days by gavage; CP group received CP ( 10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally ( IP) in the 5 CP treatment caused significant damage via changed sperm parameters ( sperm motility , count , viability rate , and abnormalities) , increased oxidative stress ( increased MDA and PC levels , and decreased GSH level) , histological changes ( degeneration , necrosis<symptom> , arrest of spermatogenesis , congestion<symptom> , and decrease in thickness of the germinal epithelium , diameter of seminiferous tubules , and Johnsen 's Score) , decreased serum testosterone level , and increased caspase-3 immunoreactivity. ZM preserved spermatogenesis and mitigated the toxic effects of CP on the testis tissue. In addition , treatment with ZM significantly reduced caspase-3 immunoreactivity. The findings of this study suggest that ZM as a potential antioxidant compound and due to free radicals scavenging activities has a protective effect against CP-induced testicular toxicity.
