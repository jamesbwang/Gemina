 An efficient deep red ( DR)- emitting organic solid based on a dicyano-phenylenevinylene derivative was reported. The structural and spectroscopic properties of the solid have been described in terms of crystallographic data and time-dependent DFT analysis. A noteworthy fluorescence quantum yield of 53 % was observed for the brightest emitter cast into solid films. This result can be explained in terms of the aggregation-induced emission ( AIE) effect.
