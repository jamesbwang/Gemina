 Cardiac fibrosis<disease> is one of the most important underlying causes of several cardiac diseases. The role of calreticulin ( CRT) in cardiac diseases has already been established. The overor under-expression of CRT can lead to cardiac diseases. This study was aimed to explore the effect of CRT on cardiac fibrosis<disease> and also to investigate the possible underlying molecular mechanism. Human cardiac fibroblast cells ( HCF) were used in the experiment. The cells were transfected with the CRT expression vector constructed by sub-cloning the full-length wild-type CRT coding sequence into pcDNA3 .1 ( pc-CRT group) , empty construct pcDNA3 .1 ( pcDNA3 .1 group) , CRT-specific siRNA ( si-CRT) , and si-NC ( negative control). The Cell Counting Kit-8 ( CCK-8) assay , apoptosis assay and invasion assay were performed. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT PCR) and western blot analysis were performed to measure the expressions of different mRNAs and proteins. The CRT expression was significantly increased ( p < 0.01) and decreased ( p < 0.01) in the pc-CRT and si-CRT groups , respectively. The CRT over-expression led to increased cell viability and invasiveness ( p < 0.05) and a decreased percentage of apoptotic cells. The over-expression of CRT led to a significant increase in the expressions of collagen ( I and III) ( p < 0.01) and matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP-2 and 9) ( p < 0.05). The Notch pathway was also significantly activated ( p < 0.05) by the over-expression of CRT and vice versa when suppressed. The results showed that the CRT over-expression was associated with increased cell viability and invasiveness and decreased apoptosis , and the activation of the Notch pathway in HCF , which suggests its possible implication in CRT-induced cardiac fibrosis<disease>.
