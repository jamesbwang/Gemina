 Endosymbiosis has been common all along eukaryotic evolution , providing opportunities for genomic and organellar innovation. Plastids are a prominent example. After the primary endosymbiosis of the cyanobacterial plastid ancestor , photosynthesis spread in many eukaryotic lineages via secondary endosymbioses involving red or green algal endosymbionts and diverse heterotrophic hosts. However , the number of secondary endosymbioses and how they occurred remain poorly understood. In particular , contrasting patterns of endosymbiotic gene transfer ( EGT) have been detected and subjected to various interpretations. In this context , accurate detection of EGTs is essential to avoid wrong evolutionary conclusions. We have assembled a strictly selected set of markers that provides robust phylogenomic evidence suggesting that nuclear genes involved in the function and maintenance of green secondary plastids in chlorarachniophytes and euglenids have unexpected mixed red and green algal origins. This mixed ancestry contrasts with the clear red algal origin of most nuclear genes carrying similar functions in secondary algae<pathogen> with red plastids.
