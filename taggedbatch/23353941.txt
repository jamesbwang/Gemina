 Early goal directed therapy for sepsis<disease> patients requires placement of central lines ( CVPL) to measure central pressure. We hypothesized that the percentage of CVPL placed for sepsis<disease> has increased over time , whereas the frequency of lines placed for other conditions has not changed. This was a retrospective cohort study. Investigators analyzed records from consecutive ED patients in nine hospitals over a 10-year period. Patients > 65 years identified with CVPL by CPT codes and diagnoses established by ICD-9 codes.We computed the annual number of patients that had a CVPL placed for sepsis<disease> and other conditions. We calculated the change from 2005 and 2014 in the normalized number of patients > 65 with sepsis<disease> and other conditions and the 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). We normalized the annual number of CVPLs by the average number of total annual visits for those > 65 years as the annual visits in the > 65 years cohort increased by > 25 % over the course of the study. We then plotted the annual number of normalized CVPLs for sepsis<disease> and other conditions placed versus year and computed the linear regression coefficients ( R Of the 3,772520 visits in the data base there were 711,435 visits by patients > 65 years; 3184 ( 0.45 %) had CVPL placed and 784 of those patients were treated for sepsis<disease>. The percent of patients with CVPL for sepsis<disease> increased 212 % ( 95 % CI: 115 % to 356 %) from 2005 to 2014 , but there was no statistically significant annual change in percent of CVPL placed for other conditions ( 10 % decrease , 95 % CI: -26 % to 9 %). The linear regression coefficient for the plot of annual normalized number of CVPLs vs. year ( See table and plot) was statistically significant for sepsis<disease> ( R We found that CVPL placed for sepsis<disease> tripled from 2004 to 2011 , whereas CVPL placed for other conditions did not change significantly.
