 Methylated cytosine is proved to have an important role as an epigenetic signal in gene regulation and is often referred to `` the fifth base of DNA ''. A comprehensive understanding of the electronic excited state relaxation in cytosine and its methylated derivatives is crucial for revealing UV-induced photodamage to the biological genome. Because of the existence of multiple closely lying `` bright '' and `` dark '' excited states , the decay pathways in these DNA nucleosides are the most complex and the least understood so far. In this study , femtosecond transient absorption with different excitation wavelengths ( 240-296 nm) was used to study the relaxation of excited electronic states of 5-methylcytosine ( 5mC) and 2 '- deoxy-5-methylcytidine ( 5mdCyd) in phosphate buffered aqueous solution and in acetonitrile solution. Two distinct nonradiative decay channels were directly observed. The first one is a several picosecond internal conversion channel that involves two bright ππ * states ( ππ *
