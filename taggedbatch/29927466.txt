 To analyze the location of familial retinal arterial tortuosity ( fRAT) in the three-dimensional structure of retinal capillaries. Retrospective observational study. Twelve eyes of six patients ( two of whom were brothers) were imaged by optical coherence tomography angiography ( OCTA). The data from their ocular and systemic examinations were recorded. OCTA imaging clearly showed increased tortuosity of second- and third-order retinal arteries in all cases , visible in the superficial vascular plexus ( SVP) up to the arteriole termination in the capillaries. No change was visible in the deep capillary plexus ( DCP). OCTA shows that fRAT affects all the course of the arterioles up to the capillaries in the SVP. The DCP does not show arteriolar tortuosity because it does not contain arterioles. ( Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2018; 49:397-401.).
