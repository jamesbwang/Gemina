 The perinatal period is a stressful transition for new parents. Various forms of educational interventions are available and are found to be efficacious in improving maternal and child outcomes. Such interventions for fathers were scarce and western-centric. Fathers should be educated as they have an impact on maternal and child outcomes. This review aims to evaluate the efficacy of quantitatively-studied informational support-focused interventions for fathers using paternal outcomes only. The search was carried out in six databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature , PubMed , Scopus , Embase , Psychological Information Database , and MedNar. Cochrane Collaboration 's tools were used to assess the eligibility of the studies. A total of 17 studies with 18 interventions were identified and included in the narrative synthesis. Most interventions were delivered to the Western population during the antenatal or postpartum period. The method of delivery for these interventions was mainly face-to-face , with inconclusive findings on various paternal psychosocial outcomes. Limited father-inclusive interventions were available. Technology-based longitudinal studies with interventions carried out across the perinatal period with longer follow-up periods were recommended for interventions providing informational support for fathers. Future studies can also examine paternal physical health and behavioural outcomes. Interventions in culturally-diverse populations should be designed and tested for their efficacies as fathers have different informational needs , especially in Asia. Informational interventions for fathers were found to be lacking and recommendations for future studies on educational interventions for fathers were discussed.
