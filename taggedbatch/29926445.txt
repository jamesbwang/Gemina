 Peptide Nucleic Acids ( PNAs) are oligonucleotide mimics that can be used to block the biological action of microRNA , thus affecting gene expression post-transcriptionally. PNAs are obtained with solid-phase peptide synthesis , and can be easily conjugated to other peptides. Conjugation with R8-Peptide or modification of the PNA backbone ( at C5 or C2 carbon) with arginine side chains allows efficient cellular uptake. The present protocol describes the synthesis of cationic PNAs that can be used alone as drugs or for efficient co-delivery in suitable inorganic nanocarriers.
