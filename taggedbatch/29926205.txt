 To investigate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter arterial embolisation ( TAE) in the management of lower gastrointestinal bleeding ( LGIB) and to identify predictors of clinical outcomes. Between December 2005 and April 2017 , 274 patients underwent diagnostic angiography for signs and symptoms of LGIB; 134 patients with positive angiographic findings were retrospectively analysed. The technical success of TAE and clinical outcomes , including recurrent bleeding , major complications , and in-hospital mortality were evaluated. The associations of various clinical and technical factors with clinical outcomes were analysed. Predictors for clinical outcomes were evaluated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. A total of 134 patients ( mean age , 59.7 years; range , 14-82 years) underwent TAE for LGIB. The bleeding foci were in the small bowel in 74 patients ( 55.2 %) , colon in 35 ( 26.1 %) , and rectum in 25 ( 18.7 %). Technical success was achieved in 127 patients ( 94.8 %). The clinical success rate was 63 % ( 80/127). The rates of recurrent bleeding , major complications , and in-hospital mortality were 27.9 % ( 31/111) , 18.5 % ( 23/124) , and 23.6 % ( 33/127) , respectively. Superselective embolisation and the use of N-butyl cyanoacrylate ( NBCA) were significant prognostic factors associated with reduced recurrent bleeding ( OR , 0.258; p = 0.004 for superselective embolisation , OR , 0.313; p = 0.01 for NBCA) and fewer major complications ( OR , 0.087; p ˂ 0.001 for superselective embolisation , OR , 0.272; p = 0.007 for NBCA). TAE is an effective treatment modality for LGIB. Superselective embolisation is essential to reduce recurrent bleeding and avoid major complications. NBCA appears to be a preferred embolic agent. • Transcatheter arterial Embolisation ( TAE) is a safe and effective treatment for lower gastrointestinal tract haemorrhage. • Superselective embolisation is essential to improve outcomes. • N-butyl cyanoacrylate ( NBCA) appears to be a preferred embolic agent with better clinical outcomes.
