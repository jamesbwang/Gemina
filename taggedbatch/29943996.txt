 Aiming at a better understanding of the solid-electrolyte interphase formation in Li-ion batteries , we have investigated the interaction of ultrathin films of ethylene carbonate ( EC) , which is a key solvent of battery electrolytes , with pristine and lithiated highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( HOPG) and with postdeposited Li. Employing X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy as well as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions , in combination with density functional theory ( DFT)- based calculations , we find that EC adsorbs molecularly intact on pristine HOPG in the entire temperature range between 80 K and desorption at 200 K. Features in the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra could be related to the molecular orbitals of EC obtained from DFT calculations , and a similar adsorption/desorption behavior is obtained also on lithiated HOPG. In contrast , stepwise postdeposition of âˆ¼ 0.5 and one monolayer of Li
