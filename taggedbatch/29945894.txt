 To report the functional and aesthetic outcomes of eyelid full-thickness skin grafting ( FTSG) in patients with facial<symptom> nerve palsy ( FNP). This is a retrospective , non-comparative , single-centre review of all patients with FNP who underwent FTSG over an 8-year period. Functional outcomes were collected through case notes review: CADS ( A total of 28 eyelid FTSGs were performed on 21 patients ( 11 female , 10 male) between 2008 and 2016. The mean age was 68 ( range , 16-89) years and the mean follow-up was 20.8 ( range , 12-30) months. The CADS score ( cornea ( p < 0.001) , static asymmetry ( p < 0.001) , dynamic function ( p < 0.001)) , MRD2 ( p = 0.002) and lagophthalmos ( blink ( p = 0.003) , gentle ( p < 0.001) , forced ( p = 0.003)) improved through early and late postoperative periods. Aesthetically , the grafts appeared to look natural in terms of colour , surface contour and graft edge from the intermediate postoperative period and continued to improve significantly by the late postoperative period. The use of periocular FTSG is effective in improving lagophthalmos and periorbital symmetry in patients with FNP where skin contraction exists. They should be considered as an adjunct to other oculoplastic procedures for both functional and aesthetic rehabilitation.
