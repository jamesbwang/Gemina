 Glioblastoma , a fatal disease in both adult and pediatric patients , currently has limited treatment options that offer no more than temporary relief. Our experiments with adult and pediatric glioblastoma cell lines showed that radiation induces a dose-dependent increase in the level of MutT homolog 1 ( MTH1)- an enzyme that hydrolyzes oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates. Similarly , the combination of vorinostat , which is a histone deacetylase inhibitor , and ABT-888 , which is a PARP-1 inhibitor , enhanced clonogenic death and increased the MTH1 level , relative to each treatment alone. This result suggests that the MTH1 level is directly related to the damage that is inflicted upon the cells , and its activity protects them against anti-neoplastic therapy. Indeed , the MTH1 inhibitor TH588 and MTH1 siRNA increased glioblastoma 's response to both radiation and the combination of vorinostat and ABT-888. TH588 also inhibited glioblastoma 's capacity for migration and invasion. In normal fibroblasts , low radiation doses and the combination of vorinostat and ABT-888 decreased the level of the enzyme. TH588 did not alter the fibroblasts ' response to radiation and only mildly affected their response to the combination of vorinostat and ABT-888. In summary , the inhibition of MTH1 is required to better realize the therapeutic potential of anti-neoplastic treatments in glioblastoma.
