 The sympathetic ( SNS) and parasympathetic ( PNS) branches of the autonomic nervous system have been implicated in the modulation of the renewal of many tissues , including the intestinal epithelium. However , it is not known whether these mechanisms are direct , requiring an interaction between autonomic neurotransmitters and receptors on proliferating epithelial cells. To evaluate the existence of a molecular framework for a direct effect of the SNS or PNS on intestinal epithelial renewal , we measured gene expression for the main autonomic neurotransmitter receptors in this tissue. We separately evaluated intestinal epithelial regions comprised of the stem , progenitor , and mature cells , which allowed us to investigate the distinct contributions of each cell population to this proposed autonomic effect. Notably , we found that the stem cells expressed the receptors for the SNS-associated alpha2A adrenoreceptor and the PNS-associated muscarinic acetylcholine receptors ( M1 and M3). In a separate experiment , we found that the application of norepinephrine or acetylcholine decreases the expression of cyclin D1 , a gene necessary for cell cycle progression , in intestinal epithelial organoids compared with controls ( P < 0.05). Together , these results provide evidence of a direct mechanism for the autonomic nervous system influence on intestinal epithelial stem cell proliferation.
