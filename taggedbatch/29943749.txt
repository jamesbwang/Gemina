 This paper follows up on a project that was launched in 2008 and contributed to the development of the new Italian Society of Occupational Medicine ( SIML) guidelines for the road haulage industry. To reach a better understanding of occupational illness amongst truck drivers , in order to define appropriate health monitoring protocols and promote a healthy life-style. We assessed 673 male drivers ( mean age 43.85 years , SD 9.56; mean working seniority 27.28 years , SD 10.59) , employed by 46 different companies. The drivers , who were gradually recruited in the study over the years , had a maximum of 8 re-assessments each , for a total of 2608 examinations. We applied a survey protocol consisting in a medical examination , questionnaires for the most common risks and instrumental and laboratory tests in compliance with SIML guidelines. We identified a total of 44 work-related diseases: 22 cases of noise-induced hearing loss ( NIHL) and 22 cases of lumbar degenerative disc disease. As regards metabolic disorders , we observed 28 cases of diabetes mellitus , in most cases ( 71.4 %) as a first diagnosis or under poor therapeutic control. We observed poorly-controlled hypertension in 103 drivers , the majority of whom ( 54 %) were diagnosed for the first time. Over 30 % of the workers in our study were obese and approximately 40 % were tobacco smokers. We identified just 9 individuals ( 1.3 %) with a positive toxicological screening for use of recreational drugs. Our data confirm a high prevalence of occupational illness amongst truck drivers. Cardiovascular and metabolic conditions require close monitoring.
