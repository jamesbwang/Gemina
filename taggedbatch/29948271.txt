 To assess the clinical behavior of inactive caries<disease> lesion<symptom> on the occlusal sites of permanent molars over 4-5 years and to estimate the risk for progression of caries-inactive sites compared with sound ones. Clinical examinations were conducted at baseline ( n = 258) and after 4-5 years and included the recording of dental plaque and dental<disease> caries<disease> at the occlusal surfaces and the eruption stage of each permanent molar. One hudred ninety-three schoolchildren were followed ( response rate of 74.8 %) , totalizing 1152 teeth. Of the children , 30.6 % ( n = 59) presented at least one molar containing an active lesion<symptom> , filling , or that had been extracted; according to the activity criterion , inactive lesions<symptom> presented around a twofold increased risk for caries<disease> progression than sound surfaces ( OR = 2.34 95 % CI = 1.51-3.62). Thirteen percent ( n = 25) of the children presented at least one molar progressing to dentine cavity , filling , or extraction; according to the severity criterion , inactive caries<disease> lesions<symptom> presented a significantly higher risk for progression when compared with sound surfaces ( OR = 2.69 , 95 % CI = 1.50-4.83). The vast majority of lesions<symptom> ( 85-90 %) identified as inactive enamel caries<disease> at baseline did not progress over 4-5 years. Despite this fact , it was possible to detect an increased risk for caries<disease> progression in caries-inactive occlusal sites compared with the sound ones. Considering the low progression rates , inactive caries<disease> lesions<symptom> do not need a specific caries-controlling treatment and should be monitored longitudinally in the same manner as sound surfaces.
