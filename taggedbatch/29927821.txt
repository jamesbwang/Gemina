 The goal of nasal reconstruction surgery is to restore normal nasal shape and function , and its success begins with creating a stable framework. In this article the authors discuss the most advantageous materials for building such a framework and how to design this element to achieve better and more durable outcomes. This is a retrospective study including patients who underwent nasal reconstruction in our rhinoplasty and nasal reconstruction center at a tertiary referral hospital between 2006 and 2016. Data included patient characteristics , defect location , the reason for defect , use of supporting structure , flap , lining , and complications were recorded. The minimum postoperative follow-up was at least 6 months after the last operation. This study included 455 patients. Nasal defects treated most commonly involved zone 2 and an average defect of 4.2 subunits. Expanded forehead flap for cover with costal cartilage as a framework and turn-over flap combined with distal end of the flap for lining was the most common reconstruction method used in this study. The complication rate was 4.39 % and nearly half of these complications were related to usage of an expander during reconstruction. Regardless of flap used , the supporting structure was the most critical element for the 3-dimensional shape of the reconstructed nose. As 1 of the 3 elements of nasal reconstruction , framework deserves adequate attention during such reconstruction.
