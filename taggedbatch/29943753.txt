 Our previous experience with the `` CardioWork '' protocol ( activated in 2005) demonstrated the usefulness of the interaction between occupational physician and cardiologist to facilitate work resumption after invasive heart procedures and subsequent rehabilitation , adapting the work tasks of the patients to the changed physical capabilities. We surveyed the health conditions and employment status of the subjects previously studied , years after their completion of the protocol in order to verify its effectiveness over a long period of time. We contacted 125 patients included in the protocol from 2005 to 2011: 4 were deceased; 101 ( 94 males and 7 females; mean age: 49.2 years) participated in the study. We collected clinical data ( from the hospital computer archive) , as well as information on prescriptions compliance and occupation ( by interview). Respondents were also asked to give a subjective judgment on their health , their re-employment , and the usefulness of the indications regarding job fitness. In addition to the high survival rate , the survey showed maintenance of satisfactory clinical conditions ( good left ventricular function , exercise tolerance , rare cardiological relapses , few sick-leave days) , adherence to prescriptions , high employment rate , high level of subjective satisfaction. The study confirms the importance of appropriate rehabilitation after acute cardiac event , and the need for an interdisciplinary approach involving the occupational physician. By following this strategy , patients not only can return to work early , satisfactorily and with minimal risks , but they also tend to keep their work and to reach retirement age in good health.
