 This study evaluated the protective effect of proanthocyanidins ( PCs) on reducing apoptosis in the mouse intestinal epithelial cell model MODE-K exposed to zearalenone ( ZEA) through inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ERS)- induced apoptosis pathway. Our results showed that PCs could reduce the rate of apoptosis in MODE-K cells exposed to ZEA (
