 Cancer stem-like cells ( CSCs) , which possess the ability to self-renewal and are multipotent , are regarded as the cause of tumor formation , recurrence , metastasis and drug resistance. It is necessary to understand the properties of CSCs in order to treat them effectively. It has been previously reported that S100 family proteins , which carry calcium-binding EF-hand motifs and are associated with tumorigenic processes , serve crucial roles in maintaining cancer stem-like properties. S100A16 is upregulated in various types of cancer , including bladder , lung and pancreatic. However , the roles of S100A16 in cancer cells , particularly CSCs , are not clear. The present study investigated the roles of S100A16 in CSCs using the sphere formation assay of Yumoto cells , which are a human cervical carcinoma cell line. The mRNA expression levels were evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and the protein expression levels were detected by western blot analysis. Following the sphere formation of Yumoto cells , the mRNA and protein expression level of Oct4 , Nanog and S100A16 were increased compared with the control cells. Following transfection with S100A16 small interfering RNA ( siRNA) , the mRNA and protein expression of Oct4 and Nanog were decreased and the spheroid size was significantly decreased in the sphere formation of Yumoto cells compared with control siRNA treated cells. There was no change in the
