 West<pathogen><disease> Nile<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus<pathogen>. The disease can be diagnosed by isolation followed by fluorescent antibody tests , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) assay. These diagnostic methods are laborious and time-consuming. The present study was aimed to evaluate the real-time reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification ( RT-LAMP) method for rapid , early and accurate diagnosis of WNV. A one-step single tube accelerated quantitative RT-LAMP assay was evaluated by targeting the Env gene of WNV. The gene amplification was accomplished by incubating the reaction mixture at 63 Â°C for 60 min in both real time turbidimeter as well as routine laboratory water bath/dry heating bath. To rule out contamination issues , proper negative controls , including no template , no primer; and no enzyme , were always kept alongside each run. The RT-LAMP assay was evaluated on 105 clinical samples from individuals having ocular infection. Of the 105 samples tested , 27 were positive for WNV by RT-LAMP assay. The comparative evaluation with conventional RT-PCR revealed 100 per cent accordance with sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 95 per cent , respectively. The specificity of this assay was confirmed with serum samples obtained from patients with dengue<pathogen><disease> and chikungunya<pathogen>. The RT-LAMP test seemed to be a sensitive and specific method for rapid detection of WNV infection and would be useful for rapid screening of a large number of clinical samples in endemic areas during outbreaks.
