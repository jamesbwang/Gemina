 To investigate the effects of flavonoids isolated from Artocarpus heterophyllus. heartwood on chemotaxis , phagocytosis , reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production and myeloperoxidase ( MPO) activity of human phagocytes. Chemotaxis was evaluated using a modified Boyden chamber and phagocytosis was determined by flowcytometer. Respiratory burst was investigated by luminol-based chemiluminescence assay while MPO activity was determined by colorimetric assay. Artocarpanone and artocarpin strongly inhibited all steps of phagocytosis. Artocarpanone and artocarpin showed strong chemotactic activity with IC Artocarpanone and artocarpin were able to suppress strongly the phagocytosis of human phagocytes at different steps and have potential to be developed into potent anti-inflammatory agents.
