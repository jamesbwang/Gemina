 Neutrophil functions have long been regarded as limited to acute<symptom> inflammation<symptom> and the defense against microbes. The role ( s) of neutrophils in cancer remain poorly understood. Neutrophils infiltrate tumors and are key effector cells in the orchestration of inflammatory responses. Thyroid cancer ( TC) is the most recurrent endocrine malignant tumor and is responsible for 70 % of deaths due to endocrine cancers. No studies are so far available on the role of neutrophils in TC. Our purpose was to study the involvement of tumor-associated neutrophils in TC. Highly purified human neutrophils ( > 99 %) from healthy donors were stimulated in vitro with conditioned media derived from TC cell lines TPC1 and 8505c ( TC-CMs). Neutrophil functions ( e.g. , chemotaxis , activation , plasticity , survival , gene expression , and protein release) were evaluated. TC-derived soluble factors promoted neutrophil chemotaxis and survival. Neutrophil chemotaxis toward a TC-CM was mediated , at least in part , by CXCL8/IL -8 , and survival was mediated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF). In addition , each TC-CM induced morphological changes and activation of neutrophils ( e.g. , CD11b and CD66b upregulation and CD62L shedding) and modified neutrophils ' kinetic properties. Furthermore , each TC-CM induced production of reactive oxygen species , expression of proinflammatory and angiogenic mediators ( CXCL8/IL -8 , VEGF-A , and TNF-Î±) , and a release of matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9). Moreover , in TC patients , tumor-associated neutrophils correlated with larger tumor size. TC cell lines produce soluble factors able to `` educate '' neutrophils toward an activated functional state. These data will advance the understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of innate immunity in TC.
