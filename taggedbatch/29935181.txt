 The maintenance of healthy adipose tissues is essential for efficient regulation of energy homeostasis. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 1 ( NFE2L1 , also known as Nrf1) , a CNC-bZIP protein , is a master regulator of the cellular adaptive response to stresses. To investigate the role of NFE2L1 in adipocytes , we bred a line of mice with adipocyte-specific Nfe2l1 knockout ( Nfe2l1 ( f)- KO) , and found that Nfe2l1 ( f)- KO mice exhibited a dramatically reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue ( SAT) mass , insulin resistance , adipocyte hypertrophy , and severe adipose inflammation<symptom>. Mechanistic studies revealed that Nfe2l1 deficiency may disturb the expression of lipolytic genes in adipocytes , leading to adipocyte hypertrophy followed by inflammation<symptom> , pyroptosis , and insulin resistance. Our findings reveal a novel role for NFE2L1 in regulating adipose tissue plasticity and energy homeostasis.
