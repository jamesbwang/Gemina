 Acute pancreatitis<disease> ( AP) is an inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> presenting from mild localized inflammation<symptom> to severe infected necrotic pancreatic tissue. In the literature , there are a few cases of hypothermia-induced AP. However , the association between hypothermia<symptom> and AP is still a myth. Generally , mortality from acute pancreatitis<disease> is nearly 3-6 %. Here , we present a 40-year-old chronic alcoholic female who presented with acute pancreatitis<disease> induced by transient hypothermia<symptom>. A 40-year-old chronic alcoholic female was hypothermic at 81 °F on arrival which was improved to 91.7 °F with warming blanket and then around 97 °F in 8 h. Laboratory tests including complete blood count , lipid panel , and comprehensive metabolic panels were within the normal limit. Serum alcohol level was 0.01 , amylase 498 , lipase 1,200 , ammonia<pathogen> 26 , serum carboxyhemoglobin level 2.4 , and β-HCG was negative. The entire sepsis<disease> workup was negative. During rewarming period , she had one episode of witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizure<symptom>. It was followed by transient hypotension<symptom>. Fluid challenge was successful with 2 L of normal saline. Sonogram ( abdomen) showed fatty liver and trace ascites. CAT scan ( abdomen and pelvis) showed evidence of acute pancreatitis<disease> without necrosis<symptom> , peripancreatic abscess<symptom> , pancreatic mass , or radiopaque gallstones. The patient was managed medically and later discharged from the hospital on the 4th day as she tolerated a normal low-fat diet. In our patient , transient hypothermia<symptom> from chronic alcohol abuse and her social circumstances might predispose to microcirculatory disturbance resulting in acute pancreatitis<disease>. Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation prevents complications.
