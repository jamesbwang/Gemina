 Rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> ( RA) is a chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> characterized by proliferation and insufficient apoptosis of synovial cells. NK4 is a hepatocyte growth factor antagonist and is implicated in cell proliferation , viability , and apoptosis of many tumour cells. This study aimed to investigate the role of NK4 in the regulation of human RA synovial cell proliferation and apoptosis. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes ( FLSs) isolated from RA patients and MH7A synovial cells were subjected to MTT , flow cytometry , and Western blot analysis. We found that NK4 suppressed cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and induced apoptosis in RA synovial cells. Furthermore , NK4 altered the expression of cell cycle and apoptosis-related proteins such as cyclin D1 , cyclin B1 , PCNA , p21 , p53 , Bcl-2 , Bax , cleaved caspase-9 , and cleaved caspase-3. Additionally , NK4 reduced the phosphorylation level of NF-κB p65 and upregulated the expression of sirt1 , but did not change the levels of p38 and p-p38 in RA-FLS and MH7A cells. In conclusion , NK4 inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis of human RA synovial cells. NK4 is a promising therapeutic target for RA. We demonstrated that NK4 inhibited cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis and arresting cell cycle in RA-FLS and MH7A cells. The apoptotic effects of NK4 may be mediated in part by decreasing Bcl-2 protein level , increasing Bax and caspase 3 protein levels , and inhibiting NF-κB signalling in RA-FLS and MH7A cells. These findings reveal potential mechanism underlying the role of NK4 in RA synovial cells and suggest that NK4 is a promising agent for RA treatment.
