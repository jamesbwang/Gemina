 Deregulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase mesenchymal epithelial transition factor ( MET) has been implicated in several human cancers and is an attractive target for small molecule drug discovery. Herein , a series of 6,7-disubstituted-4-phenoxyquinoline derivatives bearing pyridazinone derivatives were designed , synthesized and evaluated for their enzymatic inhibitory activity against c-Met kinase and cellular potency against A549 , HepG2 , and MCF-7 cell lines. Eight of them are equal to more active than positive control Foretinib against one or more cell lines and enzyme. The most promising compound
