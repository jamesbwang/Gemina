 In this investigation we developed an optimal fermentation medium to produce an exopolysaccharide ( EPS) with antioxidant activity from Rigidoporus microporus. Lactose and tryptone were chosen as the optimal carbon and nitrogen sources , respectively , for EPS production , with a 6-day cultivation cycle. After removing proteins through the use of the Sevag method , one EPS fraction was purified from the culture filtrates by gel filtration chromatography on a Sepharose CL-6B column. The preliminary chemical structure of the EPS fraction was determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , gas chromatography-mass spectrometry , and nuclear magnetic resonance. The results indicated that the main structure of the EPS consisted of β-glucopyranose and mannopyranose. Furthermore , conformational parameters such as molecular weight ( Mw) , intrinsic viscosity ( ( η)) , mean-square radii of gyration ( Rg) , and hydrodynamic radius ( Rh) of the EPS were characterized using a size exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering-refractive index viscometry method. It showed that the EPS was a kind of water-soluble polysaccharide with a moderate molecular weight ( 34.1 × 104) and a flexible , linear random coil chain structure. The antioxidant activity tests suggested that the EPS has great potential application as a natural antioxidant material in foods and medicines.
