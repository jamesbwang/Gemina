 Modification of polyamide reverse osmosis ( RO) membranes<symptom> with silver nanoparticles ( AgNP) may effectively control biofouling. While silver leaching tests are usually performed during membrane development , the lack of common testing protocols limits cross-comparison among different labs. We compare four release tests to quantify the release of dissolved and nanoparticulate silver from polyamide RO membranes<symptom> prepared through in situ surface functionalization: ( 1) batch immersion , ( 2) dead-end filtration , ( 3) cross-flow filtration , and ( 4) low-pressure water jetting. For the first time , we demonstrated the possibility of AgNP release to membrane-treated water through direct AgNP detachment. When using Nanopure water as an extraction solution , water jetting resulted in the fastest silver mass release , while dead-end filtration caused the slowest release based on the initial release kinetic data. Dead-end filtration exhibited silver mass release an order of magnitude lower than the other three tests. Although cross-flow filtration may best represent the RO membrane operation , quantifying silver release suffers from poor mass balance<symptom> due to the adsorption of dissolved silver by various reactor components and large volumes of water usage. A commonly applied batch immersion method was low cost and easily performed , but may not induce hydraulic shear sufficient for AgNP detachment from a RO membrane. The information on silver release behavior may depend on the specific test , which is important for assessing antimicrobial efficacy and service life of the nanoparticle-functionalized membranes<symptom>.
