 About 5-10 % of breast/ovarian cancers are hereditary. However , for a large proportion of cases ( around 50 %) , the genetic cause remains unknown. These cases are grouped in a separated BRCAX category. The aim of this study was to identify genomic alterations in A cohort of 31 Brazilian women was included in the study. Using the GISTIC algorithm , we identified 20 regions with genomic gains and 31 with losses. The most frequent altered regions were 1q21 .2 , 6p22 .1 and 8p23 .3 in breast tumors and Xq26 and Xp22.32-22.31 among the ovarian cancer cases. An interesting association identified was the loss of 22q13.31-13.32 and the presence of ovarian cancer cases. Among the genes present in the frequently altered regions , we found In conclusion , our results suggest that alterations on chromosomes 1 , 6 , 8 and X are common on BRCAX tumors and that the loss on 22q can be associated with the presence of ovarian cancer. DNA copy number alterations were analyzed by 60K array comparative genomic hybridization in breast and ovarian FFPE tumors.
