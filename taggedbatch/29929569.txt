 Nutritional alternatives to strengthen animal immunocompetence are critical for welfare and productivity in livestock systems , such as beef cattle operations. This experiment evaluated physiological and innate immunity effects of supplementing an immunomodulatory feed ingredient ( Omnigen-AF; Phibro Animal Health , Teaneck , NJ , USA) to beef heifers administered bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS). In total , 8 non-pregnant , non-lactating nulliparous Angus × Hereford heifers ( 676 ± 4 days of age) were ranked by BW ( 473 ± 8 kg) , and assigned to crossover design containing two periods of 34 days each. Heifers were housed in individual pens and had ad libitum access to meadow foxtail ( Alopecurus pratensis L.) hay , water and a granulated commercial vitamin + mineral mix. Within each period , heifers received ( as-fed basis) 227 g/day of dried distillers grains including ( OMN) or not ( CON) 56 g of Omnigen-AF for 34 days. On day 28 of each period ( 0800 h) , heifers received an intravenous bolus dose ( 0.5 μg/kg of BW , diluted in 5 ml of 0.9 % sterile saline) of bacterial LPS ( Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> 0111: B4). Hay DM intake was recorded daily from day 0 to 34. Blood was collected at -1 , 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 , 120 and 144 h relative to LPS administration. Heifer intravaginal temperature was recorded every 10 min from -0.5 to 10 h relative to LPS administration. No treatment effect was detected ( P = 0.35) for hay DM intake during the experiment. No treatment effects were detected ( P ⩾ 0.64) for intravaginal temperature and plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis-α , cortisol and haptoglobin , which increased ( time effect , P < 0.01) for OMN and CON heifers and peaked at 4.5 , 2 , 4 and 48 h , respectively , after LPS administration. No treatment effects were detected ( P ⩾ 0.35) for whole blood mRNA expression of chemokine ligand 5 , tumor necrosis-α , cyclooxygenase 2 and interleukin 8 , which also increased ( time effect , P < 0.01) for OMN and CON heifers and peaked at 0.5 , 1.5 , 2 and 2.5 h , respectively , after LPS administration. Whole blood mRNA expression of interleukin 8 receptor and L-selectin were also similar ( P ⩾ 0.61) between OMN and CON heifers , and decreased ( time effect , P < 0.01) for both treatments reaching nadir levels at 1 and 2.5 h , respectively , after LPS administration. Collectively , OMN supplementation did not modulate the physiological and innate immunity responses of beef heifers to bacterial LPS administration.
