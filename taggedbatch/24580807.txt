 The minimizers technique is a method to sample k-mers that is used in many bioinformatics software to reduce computation , memory usage and run time. The number of applications using minimizers keeps on growing steadily. Despite its many uses , the theoretical understanding of minimizers is still very limited. In many applications , selecting as few k-mers as possible ( i.e. having a low density) is beneficial. The density is highly dependent on the choice of the order on the k-mers. Different applications use different orders , but none of these orders are optimal. A better understanding of minimizers schemes , and the related local and forward schemes , will allow designing schemes with lower density and thereby making existing and future bioinformatics tools even more efficient. From the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of minimizers , forward and local schemes , we show that the previously believed lower bound on minimizers schemes does not hold , and that schemes with density lower than thought possible actually exist. The proof is constructive and leads to an efficient algorithm to compare k-mers. These orders are the first known orders that are asymptotically optimal. Additionally , we give improved bounds on the density achievable by the three type of schemes.
