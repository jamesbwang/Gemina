 In order to develop genomic-SSR markers for species of Saxifraga genus , a mixed plant genomic DNA sample was sequenced based on high-throughput Illumina MiSeq platform. According to genomic sequencing data , SSR loci were identified with MISA software , and then primers were designed with Primer 3 software. A total of 120 pairs of primers were randomly synthesized and amplified in genomic DNA of a few plant samples. Those primers who have yielded polymorphic bands and were considered easy to amplify were identified. After that , transferability of these primers was evaluated , and phylogenetic relationship of 25 species of Saxifraga genus was analyzed with UPGMA ( unweighted pair group method analysis). In our results , 587 256 sequences containing SSRs were identified from a total of 1 881 979 combined read pairs obtained in genomic sequencing. Primers were designated to amplify SSRs containing two to six nucleotide repeat units , screened in a small portion of species. Finally , 17 pairs of primers which have produced abundant of polymorphic bands with little problem were amplified in 25 species of Saxifraga genus. A total of 2 687 polymorphic bands were obtained , the average polymorphic rate was 158 bands per pairs of primers. The transferability rate was ranging from 88.0 % to 100 % across 25 species of Saxifraga. In phylogenetic analysis , the clustering of 25 species based on 17 pairs of SSR primers was different from morphological classification. Our analysis has provided molecular data for genetic relationship of Saxifraga genus , and the transferable and polymorphic SSRs have provided information for genetic diversity research.
