 To investigate the relationship between gene polymorphism of MTRR A66G and lower extremity deep venous thrombosis ( DVT). Two hundred and two patients with DVT as experimental group and 240 normal adults ( control group) were enrolled in this study and white blood cells were collected , respectively. Polymorphism of the 66 loci in MTRR gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific primers ( PCR-SSP) in two groups. The frequency of genotype and allele distribution of each group was compared. The frequency of AA , AG and GG genotypes in 66 sites of MTRR gene were 26.76 % , 4 3.66 % and 29.58 % in DVT group and 43.57 % , 44.28 % and 12.14 % in control group , respectively. There was no significant difference in the distribution frequency between two groups ( Ï‡ = 3.2 , P > .5). The gene polymorphism of MTRR A66G may not be an independent genetic risk factor in DVT in China.
