 Fibrous materials have garnered much interest in the field of biomedical engineering due to their high surface-area-to-volume ratio , porosity , and tunability. Specifically , in the field of tissue engineering , fiber meshes have been used to create biomimetic nanostructures that allow for cell attachment , migration , and proliferation , to promote tissue regeneration and wound<disease><symptom> healing , as well as controllable drug delivery. In addition to the properties of conventional , synthetic polymer fibers , fibers made from natural polymers , such as proteins , can exhibit enhanced biocompatibility , bioactivity , and biodegradability. Of these proteins , keratin , collagen , silk , elastin , zein , and soy are some the most common used in fiber fabrication. The specific capabilities of these materials have been shown to vary based on their physical properties , as well as their fabrication method. To date , such fabrication methods include electrospinning , wet/dry jet spinning , dry spinning , centrifugal spinning , solution blowing , self-assembly , phase separation , and drawing. This review serves to provide a basic knowledge of these commonly utilized proteins and methods , as well as the fabricated fibers & rsquo; applications in biomedical research.
