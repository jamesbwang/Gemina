 Introduction: The epidemiology of common cancers in Kerman province , southeast of Iran , was assessed based upon results of the Kerman Population-Based Cancer Registry Program ( KPBCR). Methods: in this retrospective study , all patients diagnosed with primary cancers and registered with the KPBCR were included. New cancer cases registered from 2014 were identified from pathological labs , medical reports of 48 health facilities providing cancer diagnosis or treatment services and the national death registry program. Data for patients who were referred to neighboring provinces to access health services were also collected from national referral registries. Results from autopsies was additionally extracted from regional forensic and legal medicine centers and added to the registry periodically. Age standardized incidence rates ( ASRs) per 100,000 person-years for all cancers were computed , using direct-standardization and CanReg methodology. Mortality to incidence ( M: I) ratios and microscopically verified ( MV) proportions were calculated as quality measures. Results: A total of 2,838 cases of cancer were registered in Kerman province , 2014. Of these 45. 6 % involved women ( n = 1,293). Individuals aged 60-64 years represented the largest proportion ( 11.6 %) of the total cancer prevalence , followed by those aged 55-59 years ( 10.86 %) and 65-69 years ( 8.99 %). The ASRs for all cancers were 155.1 and 118.90 per 100,000 , in men and women , respectively. In women , breast ( ASR: 26.4) , skin ( ASR: 13.0) , thyroid ( ASR: 9.2) , leukemia<disease> ( ASR: 8.0) and colorectal ( ASR: 7.70) were the most common cancers. In men , bladder ( ASR: 24.70) , skin ( ASR: 16.80) , lung ( ASR: 14.6) , leukemia<disease> ( ASR: 14.50) , and stomach ( ASR: 10.8) were found to be the most frequent. Conclusion: This study provided latest evidence on epidemiology of cancer in the southeast of Iran that could be used to empower prevention and control interventions in a developing country.
