 The GuideLiner ( GL) is a widely used catheter primarily in complex percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI). Deep seating of the GL and distal stent placement may be facilitated by the anchor balloon technique ( ABT). We aimed to prospectively analyze procedural details , technical success , complications and in-hospital outcome in patients who underwent PCI using the GL catheter and the ABT. A total of 118 patients underwent PCI with the aid of the GL and ABT. Procedure success rate was 95 % ( 112/118) and only seven patients ( 5.9 %) encountered complications. ABT was indicated and successfully used in 29 patients ( 25 %). GL and ABT successfully aided stent delivery in unfavorable and heavily calcified lesions<symptom> which otherwise may have been considered unsuitable for PCI.
