 Selenium ( Se) is an essential micro-element for human and animals. In higher plants , Se essentiality or phyto-toxicity is less explored. Therefore , we aimed to examine the effects of Se ( 0 , 25 , 50 , and 100 µM) as sodium selenite on the physio-chemical , cell ultra-structural and genomic alterations in hydroponically grown seedlings of four cultivars of B. napus ( cvs. Zheda 619 , Zheda 622 , ZS 758 , and ZY 50). Results showed that excessive ( 100 µM) Se ( IV) exhibited significant reduction in plant growth parameters , declined pigment contents , lower water-soluble protein levels , and overproduction of H
