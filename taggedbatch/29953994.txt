 To evaluate papillary , peripapillary , and macular vasculature with optical coherence tomography angiography in preperimetric ( PPG) , primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG) , and normal eyes , and to assess diagnostic ability and associations among the vasculature and structural damage. This was an observational , cross-sectional study. Retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL) , ganglion cell complex thickness , whole-image ( wiVD) , inside disc ( idVD) , peripapillary ( ppVD) , and macular vessel densities were obtained. Analysis of variance , post hoc test , and Pearson coefficient were used. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC) and cut-offs were calculated. Thirteen healthy , 39 PPG , and 19 POAG eyes were included. Papillary and peripapillary VD were lower in POAG eyes in all parameters analyzed. wiVD in PPG eyes ( 52.37 ± 5.04 %) was significantly decreased compared to healthy eyes ( 58.02 ± 2.02 % , p < 0.05). AUC ranged from 0.62 to 0.90; the established cut-off values were 56 % for wiVD , 55 % for idVD , and 62 % for ppVD. Pearson 's correlation coefficient showed a direct correlation between the papillary or peripapillary VD and RNFL thickness. Vessel densities in POAG eyes are significantly lower than in healthy eyes , and they show good discriminatory abilities. A diminished microvascular network is associated with RNFL thinning more strongly in POAG than in PPG eyes.
