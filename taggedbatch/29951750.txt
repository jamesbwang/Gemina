 While guidelines for laparoscopic abdominal surgery advise using the lowest possible intra-abdominal pressure , commonly a standard pressure is used. We evaluated the feasibility of a predefined multifaceted individualized pneumoperitoneum strategy aiming at the lowest possible intra-abdominal pressure during laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Multicenter prospective study in patients scheduled for laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The strategy consisted of ventilation with low tidal volume , a modified lithotomy position , deep neuromuscular blockade , pre-stretching of the abdominal wall , and individualized intra-abdominal pressure titration; the effect was blindly evaluated by the surgeon. The primary endpoint was the proportion of surgical procedures completed at each individualized intra-abdominal pressure level. Secondary endpoints were the respiratory system driving pressure , and the estimated volume of insufflated CO Ninety-two patients were enrolled in the study. Fourteen cases were converted to open surgery for reasons not related to the strategy. The intervention was feasible in all patients and well-accepted by all surgeons. In 61 out of 78 patients ( 78 %) , surgery was performed and completed at the lowest possible IAP , 8 mmHg. In 17 patients , IAP was raised up to 12 mmHg. The relationship between IAP and driving pressure was almost linear. The mean estimated intra-abdominal CO A multifaceted individualized pneumoperitoneum strategy during laparoscopic colorectal surgery was feasible and resulted in an adequate working space in most patients at lower intra-abdominal pressure and lower respiratory driving pressure.
