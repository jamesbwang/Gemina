 A potent antiplasmodial polycyclic xanthone , MDN-0185 ( 1) , was isolated from an unidentified species of the genus Micromonospora. The planar structure of 1 was established as a seven-ring polycyclic xanthone with partial structures very similar to two known natural products , namely , xantholipin and Sch 54445. Using ROESY correlations , the relative stereochemistry of the two independent stereoclusters of compound 1 could be determined. Mosher analysis and comparison of the specific rotation of compound 1 with that of xantholipin allowed the determination of its absolute configuration. Compound 1 exhibited an IC
