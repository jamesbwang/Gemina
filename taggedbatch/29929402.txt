 Therapeutic vaccine appears to be a potential approach for the treatment of human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>)- associated tumours , but its efficacy can be dampened by immunosuppressive factors such as transforming growth factor ( TGF)- β1. We sought to investigate whether active immunity against TGF-β1 enhances the anti-tumour immunity elicited by an HPV16 E7-specific vaccine that we developed previously. In this study , virus-like particles of hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> core antigen were used as vaccine carriers to deliver either TGF-β1 B cell epitopes or E7 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitope. The combination of preventive immunization against TGF-β1 and therapeutic immunization with the E7 vaccine significantly reduced the growth of grafted TC-1 tumours in C57 mice , showing better efficacy than immunization with only one of the vaccines. The improved efficacy of combined immunization is evidenced by elevated IFN-γ and decreased IL-4 and TGF-β1 levels in cultured splenocytes , increased E7-specific IFN-γ-expressing splenocytes , and increased numbers of CD4
