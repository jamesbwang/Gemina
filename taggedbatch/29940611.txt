 In this review are highlighted the corrosion and biocompatibility of biodegradable Mg alloys for their use in orthopedic applications. It was revealed that mixing with alloying elements , such as Mn and Zn , provides improved corrosion resistance to Mg alloys; this pursuit is built on the fact that Mg and its alloys are degradable through their time in the human body. Furthermore , Mg alloys afford a characteristic profile that is very close or even almost identical to that of human bone. Minimizing the rate of corrosion of Mg is the most adequate method , because a low corrosion rate of an Mg implant involves a decrease in the extent of hydrogen evolution and alkalization , which allow the human body<symptom> to gradually absorb or consume the corrosion products.
