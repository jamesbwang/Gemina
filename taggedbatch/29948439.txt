 Segmental isotope labelling enables the NMR study of an individual domain within a multidomain protein , but still in the context of the entire full-length protein. Compared to the fully labelled protein , spectral overlap can be greatly reduced. We here describe segmental labelling of the ( double-) hexameric DnaB helicase from Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> using a ligation approach. Solid-state spectra demonstrate that the ligated protein has the same structure and structural order as the directly expressed full-length protein. We uniformly
