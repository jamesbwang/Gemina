 To characterize the choriocapillaris ( CC) in highly myopic eyes with myopic maculopathy , using optical coherence tomographic angiography. Prospective , clinic-based study of 42 eyes of 38 patients with high myopia ( ≤ -6 diopters and axial length ≥ 26.5 mm). Myopic maculopathy was graded from fundus photographs according to the Meta-Analysis for Pathologic Myopia classification. Macular 3 × 3 mm en face optical coherence tomographic angiographic images were obtained with swept-source optical coherence tomographic angiography and graded for CC flow impairment as follows: 1) intact CC , 2) focal ( < 1 mm) , and 3) extensive ( > 1 mm). Of the 42 eyes , 17 ( 39.5 %) had tessellated fundus , 20 ( 46.5 %) had diffuse , and 6 ( 14.0 %) had patchy atrophy. Choriocapillaris flow impairment was observed in all eyes with diffuse and patchy atrophy. Even in eyes with tessellated fundus only , CC signal voids were seen in 3 eyes ( 17.6 %). With increasingly severe myopic maculopathy , the pattern of CC flow impairment changed from predominantly focal to predominantly extensive. Choriocapillaris flow impairment was observed in many highly myopic eyes , even in those with mild fundus changes , and worsened with increasing severity of myopic maculopathy. Longitudinal studies are needed to assess whether CC flow impairment predicts the risk of myopic maculopathy progression.
