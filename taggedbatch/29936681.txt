 Lactotroph adenomas ( LA) are the most frequently encountered pituitary tumors. Although more frequently observed in women , LAs in men were recently included in a more aggressive category regardless of histological grading , by the WHO. We aimed to perform a rigorous retrospective review of a single center 's pre-operative evaluation , patient characteristics and outcomes of male LAs patients requiring pituitary surgery. A retrospective review , over 11 years , of patients who underwent resection of a pituitary adenoma at a single center was conducted. Predictors of persistent disease in male LAs patients along with a comparison to predictors of silent corticotroph adenomas ( SCAs) patients who also underwent surgery at the center was also conducted. Thirty-one male patients with LAs were identified. When compared to SCAs patients , LAs male patients were younger ( 41 vs. 50 years of age , p = 0.01). Men with LAs had more invasive tumors ( 75 % vs. 44.7 % p = 0.02). More LAs in men had residual tumor after surgery than patients with SCA ( 92.6 % vs. 42.1 % , p < 0.001). Male patients with LAs and patients with SCA had similar rates of requiring additional surgery ( 28.9 % vs. 24.1 % , p = NS) and radiation therapy ( 18.4 % vs. 19.4 % , p = NS). High rates of DA resistance , invasive tumors and postoperative residual disease in male patients with LA who required surgery are shown. Surgery improved optic chiasm compression , PRL level and central hypogonadism but , not surprisingly , failed to normalize other pituitary hormones and/or eliminate need for DA therapy.
