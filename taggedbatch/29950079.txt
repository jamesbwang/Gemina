 To establish the fingerprints of biles of pig , cattle and sheep , HPLC was used with Acclaim ™ RSLC 120 C ₁₈ column ( 3.0 mm × 100 mm , 2.2 μm , 120 Å) , the column temperature 35 °C , acetonitrile-1 % perchloric acid as mobile phase , gradient elution , 0.5 mL · min ⁻¹ flow rate , and detection wavelength at 200 nm. The fingerprint was generated by using Similarity Evaluation Software of Chromatographic Fingerprint of Chinese Medicine ( 2004A Edition). The fingerprint peaks were identified by reference substances and verified by ELSD and LC-MS/MS. Then , the biles of pig , cattle and sheep were detected to contain 14 , 9 and 8 common fingerprint peaks respectively , and the similarity was greater than 0.92. To analyze each technical parameter , GHDCA in pig bile and TCA in cattle and sheep bile were selected as reference peak. The precision , repeatability and stability all meet the requirements of fingerprint establishment. The RSD of the relative retention time of the fingerprint peaks was less than 1.5 % , and the RSD of the relative peak area was less than 5 %. The fingerprint peaks in pig bile were THDCA , TCDCA , GHDCA and GCDCA , and TCA , TCDCA , GCA , GCDCA and GDCA in cattle and sheep bile. The main components of pig , cattle and sheep bile were conjugated bile acids , but there were significant differences in bile acids between pig bile and cattle , sheep biles. The HPLC method established in this paper is simple , rapid and reproducible , and could be applied to the identification and quality control of biles.
