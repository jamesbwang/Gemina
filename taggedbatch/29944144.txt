 The human emotional reactions to stimuli delivered by different sensory modalities is a topic of interest for many disciplines , from Human-Computer-Interaction to cognitive sciences. Different databases of stimuli eliciting emotional reaction are available , tested on a high number of participants. Interestingly , stimuli within one database are always of the same type. In other words , to date , no data was obtained and compared from distinct types of emotion-eliciting stimuli from the same participant. This makes it difficult to use different databases within the same experiment , limiting the complexity of experiments investigating emotional reactions. Moreover , whereas the stimuli and the participants ' rating to the stimuli are available , physiological reactions of participants to the emotional stimuli are often recorded but not shared. Here , we test stimuli delivered either through a visual , auditory , or haptic modality in a within participant experimental design. We provide the results of our study in the form of a MATLAB structure including basic demographics on the participants , the participant 's self-assessment of his/her emotional state , and his/her physiological reactions ( i.e. , skin conductance).
