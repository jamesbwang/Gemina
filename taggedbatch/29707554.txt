 The L5 nerve root could be compressed at both L4-5 and L5-S1 regions. If L5 nerve root has confirmed compression at L4-5 level and questionable compression at L5-S1 foramina , performing both surgeries at L4-5 and L5-S1 levels may induce unnecessary extra surgery on L5-S1; however , ignoring foraminal stenosis of L5/S1 may require re-exploration. Two hundred seventeen patients with L5 nerve root compressed at L4-5 lateral access were performed with L4-5 decompression and interbody fusion. Lee For all of 217 patients who underwent L4-5 surgery , L5-S1 foramina were preoperatively assessed as: grade 0: 125 cases , grade 1: 58 cases , grade 2: 23 cases , and grade 3: 11 cases. After intra-operative L5 nerve root detection , 11/11 patients with grade 3 radiographic foraminal stenosis , 6/23 ( 26.1 %) with grade 2 and 2/58 ( 3.4 %) who had grade 1 underwent L4-5 and L5-S1 transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion ( TLIF) , the others received only L4-5 TLIF. Compared to pre-operative baseline data , both L4-5 TLIF and L4-5 and L5-S1 TLIF groups had significant decreased VAS of low<symptom> back pain and leg<symptom> pain<symptom> , and ODI at 3 and 24 months after operation. We suggested that our novel nerve root probe combined with pre-operative radiographic grade may be helpful to surgeons to identify the single or double compression of L5 nerve root and make a more precise surgical strategy to improve surgical outcome than the method depended on pre-operative radiographic grade alone.
