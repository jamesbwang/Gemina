 Saturated fatty acids are the most abundant fatty acids in the brain , however , there has been some debate regarding the ability of intact dietary saturated fatty acids to be incorporated into the brain. In the present study , we use compound specific isotope analysis to measure the natural abundance carbon isotopic signature of brain , liver , and blood palmitic acid ( PAM) and compare it to the dietary PAM and sugar isotopic signatures to calculate the relative contribution of both the incorporation of intact and endogenously synthesized PAM to these pools. Mice were equilibrated to the study diet , and extracted fatty acids were analyzed with gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry to determine the carbon isotopic signature of PAM ( Î´
