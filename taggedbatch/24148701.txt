 Oral verruciform xanthoma ( OVX) is a rare lesion<symptom>. The purpose of the present study is to describe the clinical features of 13 OVXs and review all cases reported in the English literature. Thirteen cases of OVX diagnosed during a 47-year period were retrospectively collected. The patients gender and age , as well as the main clinical features of the lesions<symptom> were retrieved from the biopsy request forms. Pubmed , Scopus and Google ScholarTM electronic databases were searched with the key word verruciform xanthoma. Only cases of histologically confirmed OVX were included in the study. The 13 OVXs represented approximately 0.04 % of 35,617 biopsies accessioned during the study period. They affected 13 patients , 8 males and 5 females with a mean age of 48.8 Â± 14 years. They mainly appeared as asymptomatic granular nodules<symptom> or plaques , with elastic or normal consistency and white color , in the gingiva or hard palate. Literature review yielded 416 cases of OVX. With the addition of cases of the present study , 429 cases of OVX have been presented in the English literature. OVX has a slight male predominance with a male to female ratio of 1.4:1 and the majority of patients are in the 5th to 7th decade of life. Clinically , OVX mainly presents as an asymptomatic , single , papillary or granular plaque or nodule<disease> , with elastic or soft consistency and white , red or pink color. It measures approximately 1 cm and is most commonly located on the gingiva , tongue , hard palate or buccal mucosa. The treatment of choice is surgical excision with little rates of recurrence. Verruciform xanthoma is a rare lesion<symptom> most often encountered on the ginigival mucosa. As its clinical presentation is not pathognomonic , it should be included in the differential diagnosis of verrucous or papillary lesions<symptom>.
