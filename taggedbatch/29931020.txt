 A liquid Na-K alloy is adsorbed onto a super-aligned carbon nanotube membrane ( denoted CM) at room temperature , which is driven by capillary force , fabricating a flexible CM@NaK membrane. The anode directly using the CM@NaK membrane exhibits a smooth electrode-electrolyte ( liquid-liquid) interface , contributing to fast ion transport and a dendrite-free stripping/plating process.
