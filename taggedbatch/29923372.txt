 To detect the changes of （ interleukin , IL ） -1 α , IL-1β and IL-13 mRNA in lung tissue and serum of drown rats , and to explore the potential value for the diagnosis of drowning in forensic practice. Eighteen SD rats were randomly divided into drowning group , blank control group and myocardial infarction group （ as control group ）. The serum of right ventricular , the inferior lobe of right lung and the myocardium were taken from the rats in different groups. The expressions of IL-1α , IL-1β and IL-13 mRNA in the lung tissue and the serum of right ventricular were detected by TaqMan probe method. The expression differences of IL-1α , IL-1β and IL-13 mRNA in lung tissue between drowning group and blank control group , myocardial infarction group were not statistically significant （ The changes of cytokines IL-1β and IL-13 mRNA in the serum of right ventricular of drown rats are statistical significance , which are highly correlated with drowning.
