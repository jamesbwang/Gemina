 Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions help understand and engineer metabolism. Next-Gen sequencing technologies are delivering genomes and transcriptomes for an ever-widening range of plants. While such omic data can , in principle , be used to compare metabolic networks in different species , organs , and environmental conditions , these comparisons require a standardized framework for metabolic network reconstruction from transcript data. We previously introduced the PlantSEED as a framework covering primary metabolism for ten species. We have now expanded PlantSEED to include 39 species and provide tools that enable automated annotation and metabolic reconstruction from transcriptome data. The algorithm for automated annotation in PlantSEED propagates annotations using a set of signature k-mers ( short amino acid sequences characteristic of particular proteins) that identify metabolic enzymes with an accuracy of ~ 97 %. PlantSEED reconstructions are built from a curated template that includes consistent compartmentalization for > 100 primary metabolic subsystems. Together , the annotation and reconstruction algorithms produce reconstructions without gaps and with more accurate compartmentalization than existing resources. These tools are available via the PlantSEED web interface at http://modelseed.org , which enables users to upload , annotate , and reconstruct from private transcript data and simulate metabolic activity under various conditions using flux balance<symptom> analysis. We demonstrate the ability to compare these metabolic reconstructions with a case-study involving growth on several nitrogen sources in roots of four species. This article is protected by copyright.
