 To assess the extent to which multiple gestations mediate risk of pregnancy complications from fertility treatment and to address possible confounding by the underlying infertility<symptom>. From the nearly 1.8 million pregnancies recorded in the Swedish Medical Birth Register between 1996 and 2013 , we selected the 9.9 % ( N = 174 067) that occurred to couples with known trouble conceiving ( clinical infertility<symptom>). Fertility treatment was identified from self-reports , medical records and procedural information from fertility clinics. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios ( ORs) and their 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) , and decomposed the total effect into direct and mediated effects to estimate the proportion mediated by multiple gestations. Compared with pregnancies achieved without any assistance , those having received some treatment had higher odds of all studied complications except gestational diabetes. Associations with placenta previa ( OR 2.17 , 95 % CI 1.95-2.40) and placental abruption ( OR 1.77 , 95 % CI 1.54-2.03) were almost entirely independent of multiple gestations. In contrast , the majority of the associations with preterm birth ( OR 1.69 , 95 % CI 1.62-1.77) , caesarean delivery ( RR 1.15 , 95 % CI 1.13-1.17) and pre-eclampsia ( OR 1.17 , 95 % CI 1.11-1.22) were mediated by multiple gestations ( 87 % , 62 % and 91 % of the effect mediated , respectively). Both direct and mediated pathways contributed to the remaining positive associations with chorioamnionitis<disease> , labour induction and postpartum haemorrhage. Results were similar when considering primi- and multi-parous women separately , and after restriction to assisted reproductive technologies only. Multiple gestations are responsible for a large proportion of pregnancy complications associated with fertility treatment , suggesting that interventions to restrict the occurrence of multiples could reduce excess risk of pre-eclampsia , preterm birth and caesarean delivery after fertility treatment. However , the elevated risk of serious placental complications after fertility treatment appears to be largely independent of multiple gestations.
