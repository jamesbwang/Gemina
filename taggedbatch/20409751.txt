 There have been few studies on the prognostic significance of suprapancreatic lymph nodes ( SPLNs) , which are targeted in D2 dissections in patients with gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of SPLNs by determining whether treatment outcomes of SPLN-positive gastric cancer are comparable to that of SPLN-negative cancer.This study enrolled patients with node-positive gastric cancer , who underwent curative surgery with D2 dissection , at the Samsung Medical Centre from 2007 to 2009. The survival outcomes of patients with and without metastatic SPLNs were analyzed.The total number of patients was 1086 , with 377 patients ( 34.7 %) having metastatic SPLNs. SPLN positivity was associated with a more advanced tumor status and the 5-year survival rate of the SPLN-positive group was significantly lower than that of the SPLN-negative group ( 59.5 % vs 81.2 % , P < .001). However , the survival was not significantly different between the 2 groups when comparing SPLN status within a given disease stage. Cox multivariate analysis revealed that SPLN metastasis was not an independent prognostic factor.SPLNs were not different from perigastric lymph nodes in terms of prognostic significance and SPLN metastasis should be regarded as a locoregional disease. Complete removal of SPLNs by D2 dissection is recommended for the locoregional control of gastric cancer.
