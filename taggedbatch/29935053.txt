 Glioblastomas are a subtype of gliomas , which are the most aggressive and deadly form of brain tumours. The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) is over-expressed and amplified in glioblastomas. Luteolin is a common bioflavonoid found in a variety of fruits and vegetables. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular and biological effects of luteolin on EGF-induced cell proliferation and the potential of luteolin to induce apoptosis in glioblastoma cells. In vitro cell viability assays demonstrated that luteolin decreased cell proliferation in the presence or absence of EGF. Immunoblots revealed that luteolin decreased the protein expression levels of phosphorylated Akt , mTOR , p70S6K and MAPK in the presence of EGF. Furthermore , our results revealed the ability of luteolin to induce caspase and PARP cleavages in glioblastoma cells in addition to promoting cell cycle arrest. Our results demonstrated that luteolin has an inhibitory effect on downstream signalling molecules activated by EGFR , particularly the Akt and MAPK signalling pathways , and provided a rationale for further clinical investigation into the use of luteolin as a therapeutic molecule in the management of glioblastoma.
