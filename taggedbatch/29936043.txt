 Milk thistle ( Silybum marianum; SM) is an herb commonly used for hepatoprotection with antioxidant and antifibrotic properties. We investigated in pigs the cardiac effects of SM intake during the acute phase of myocardial infarction ( MI) and remodeling period post-MI. Study-1 tested the effect of SM use on the acute phase of MI. Hence , animals were distributed to a control group or to receive SM prior infarction ( 1.5 h ischemia). Animals were sacrificed after 2.5 h of reperfusion. Study-2 tested the effect of SM use in the cardiac remodeling phase. Accordingly , animals received for 10 d diet ± SM prior MI and followed the same regime for 3 weeks and then sacrificed. Study-3 tested the effect of SM in a non-infarcted heart; therefore , animals received for 10 d diet ± SM and then sacrificed. Animals taking SM before MI showed a reduction in cardiac damage ( decreased oxidative damage , ROS production and xanthine oxidase levels; preserved mitochondrial function; and increased myocardial salvage; p < 0.05) versus controls. Animals that remained on chronic SM intake post-MI improved left ventricular remodeling. This was associated with the attenuation of the TGFß Intake of SM protects the heart against the deleterious effects of an MI and favors cardiac healing. These benefits may be attributed to the antioxidant and antifibrotic properties of SM.
