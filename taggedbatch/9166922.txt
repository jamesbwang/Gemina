 The impact of cognitive aging on brain function and structure is complex , and the relationship between aging-related structural changes and cognitive function are not fully understood. Physiological and pathological changes to the aging brain are highly variable , making it difficult to estimate a cognitive trajectory with which to monitor the conversion to cognitive decline. Beyond the information on the structural and functional consequences of cognitive aging gained from brain imaging and neuropsychological studies , non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS) can enable stimulation of the human brain
