 Prolonged therapy with all-trans-retinoic acid ( ATRA) and arsenic trioxide ( ATO) is highly effective in newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia<disease> ( APL) but there is limited data on the efficacy of this regimen in the relapse setting. We report here on 22 APL patients treated with prolonged ATRA-ATO therapy at the time of disease relapse. Twenty patients obtained molecular complete remission ( CRm) after 2 cycles ( 90 %). Of these , two patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT) while the remaining proceeded to receive additional cycles ( up to a total of 5) of ATRA-ATO. With a median follow-up of 58 months from the time of relapse ( range: 21-128 months) , the 4-year OS probability was 0.85 ( 95 % CI 0.61-0.94) , DFS was 0.74 ( 95 % CI 0.49-0.88) , and EFS 0.68 ( 95 % CI 0.45-0.83). Two patients were resistant to ATRA-ATO salvage and five relapsed at a median of 19 months. Of these , four died due to progressive disease while three relapsed achieved a new CRm after further salvage therapy. This experience confirms the potentially curative effect of prolonged ATRA-ATO therapy in relapsed APL , especially in patients with long first complete remission.
