 In eukaryotes , the biosynthesis of a highly conserved dolichol-linked oligosaccharide ( DLO) precursor , Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-pyrophosphate-dolichol (- PP-Dol) begins on the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) and ends within the lumen. Two functionally distinguished heteromeric glycosyltransferase ( GTase) complexes are responsible for the cytosolic DLO assembly. Alg1 , a β-1 , 4 mannosyltransferase ( MTase) physically interacts with Alg2 and Alg11 proteins to form the multienzyme complex which catalyzes the addition of all five mannose to generate the Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol intermediate. Despite the fact that Alg1 plays a central role in formation of the multi-MTase has been confirmed , the topological information of Alg1 including the molecular mechanism of membrane association are still poorly understood. Using a combination of bioinformatics and biological approaches , we have undertaken a structural and functional study on Alg1 protein , in which the enzymatic activities of Alg1 and its variants were monitored by a complementation assay using the GALpr-ALG1 yeast strain , and further confirmed by a LC-MS-based in vitro quantitative assay. Computational and experimental evidences confirmed Alg1 shares structure similarity with Alg13/14 complex , which has been defined as a membrane-associated GT-B glycosyltransferase. Particularly , we provide clear evidence that the N-terminal transmembrane domain ( TMD) including the following positively charged amino acids and an N-terminal amphiphilic-like α helix domain exposed on the protein surface strictly coordinate the Alg1 orientation on the ER membrane. This work provides detailed membrane topology of Alg1 and further reveals its biological importance at the spatial aspect in coordination of cytosolic DLO biosynthesis.
