 To establish patterns of subsequent injury in U18 rugby , to quantify the burden of within season injury recurrence. Secondary analysis of prospective data. 28 Schools in Ireland. 825 male rugby players ( aged 15-18 years). Subsequent injuries were classified as: new , local or recurrent ( same site and type as index injury). All recurrent injuries were sub-grouped by body part and diagnosis. Burden was based on frequency , days lost and injury proportion ratios. A total of 426 injuries were eligible for analysis , of which , 121 were subsequent injuries. The majority of subsequent injuries involved a different body part than their index injury. There were n = 23 cases of within season recurrence. 78 % of recurrences occurred within 2 months of return to play. Recurrent injuries comprised 5 % of all injuries and their cumulative time loss was 1073 days. Recurrent injury to the ankle ligaments , lumbar muscles and concussions carried the greatest burden. The burden of recurrent injury in U18 rugby is lower than in the professional game. However , this population could benefit from targeted secondary prevention efforts including reconsideration of return-to-play protocols for ankle sprain , lumbar muscles and potentially concussion.
