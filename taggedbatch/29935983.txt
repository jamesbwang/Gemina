 Robust correlation between the severity of rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> ( RA) and cigarette smoking has been clinically demonstrated. Nevertheless , cigarette compounds responsible for this toxic effect and their mechanisms have not been described. Considering that hydroquinone ( HQ) is an abundant , pro-oxidative compound of the matter particle phase of cigarette smoke , we investigated whether HQ exposure during the initial phase of collagen-induced arthritis<disease><symptom> ( CIA) could aggravate the disease. For this purpose , male Wistar rats were exposed to aerosolized HQ ( 25 ppm) , saline or 5 % ethanol solution ( HQ vehicle) for 1 h per day during 14 days. CIA was induced through s.c. injection of bovine collagen Type II ( 0.4 mg/100 Î¼L) at days seven and 14 of exposure. Clinical signs of disease and the cell profile and chemical mediators in the synovial fluid and membrane were analysed at day 35 after the beginning of exposure. HQ exposure aggravated CIA-related paw edema<symptom> and increased the cell infiltrate and interleukin-6 ( IL-6) levels in the synovial fluid , promoted intense tissue collagen deposition and enhanced synoviocyte proliferation and higher frequency of aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR
