 CRM1 ( Exportin1/XPO1) exports hundreds of broadly functioning protein cargos out of the cell nucleus by binding to their classical nuclear export signals ( NESs). The 8-15 amino acids long NESs contain 4-5 hydrophobic residues and are highly diverse in both sequence and CRM1-bound structure. Here , we examine the relationship between nuclear export activities of 24 different NES peptides in cells , and their CRM1-NES affinities. We found that binding affinity and nuclear export activity are linearly correlated for NESs with dissociation constants ( K
