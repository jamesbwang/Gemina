 The objective of this study was to formulate once-a-day extended-release ( ER) pellet system of imidafenacin ( IDN) , a recently approved urinary antispasmodic agent with twice-a-day dosing regimen. The sugar sphere pellets were firstly layered with IDN and hypromellose and then coated with Eudragit RS ( copolymers of acrylic and methacrylic acid esters) , employed as a release modifier , using a fluid-bed coater. Solid-state characterizations using solid-state X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimeter indicated that the antispasmodic agent was homogeneously layered onto the pellets in an amorphous state. Drug release from multiple-unit ER system was effectively retarded in proportion to the amount of Eudragit RS in the outer layer , with a high correlation value above 0.86. In a pharmacokinetic evaluation in beagle dogs , the plasma concentration profile of IDN was markedly protracted by ER pellets , exhibiting delayed the time needed to reach the maximum drug concentration and the elimination half-life in plasma , compared to the commercial immediate release form ( Uritos Â® tablet , Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd. , Japan). Therefore , the novel ER pellets can be a promising tool for oral IDN therapy , providing a once-a-day dosing regimen , and thus , improving patient compliance.
