 Hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> A<pathogen><disease> and B disease burden persists in the US. We assessed hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> A<pathogen><disease> and hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> vaccination series completion rates among 350,240 commercial/Medicare and 12,599 Medicaid enrollees aged â‰¥ 19 years. A vaccination series was considered as completed provided that the minimum interval between doses , as defined by the CDC , and the minimum number of doses were reached. We stratified completion rates by vaccine type ( i.e. monovalent or bivalent) at initial vaccination for each cohort. In the commercial/Medicare cohort , the series completion rate was 32.0 % for hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> A<pathogen><disease> and 39.6 % for hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> among those who initiated with a monovalent vaccine , and it was 36.2 % for hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> A<pathogen><disease> and 48.9 % for hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> among those who initiated with a bivalent vaccine. In the Medicaid cohort , the series completion rate was 21.0 % for hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> A<pathogen><disease> and 24.0 % for hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> among those who initiated with a monovalent vaccine , and it was 19.0 % for hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> A<pathogen><disease> and 24.6 % for hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> among those who initiated with a bivalent vaccine. In conclusion , hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> A<pathogen><disease> and B vaccination series completion rates were low , and appeared to be lower among Medicaid than among commercial/Medicare enrollees. Commercial/Medicare enrollees who initiated with a bivalent vaccine had higher series completion rates than those who initiated with monovalent vaccines- an observation that was not made among Medicaid enrollees.
