 Calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP) is formed by alternative transcription of the calcitonin/α-CGRP gene , which also gives rise to calcitonin ( CT). Recently , CGRP has been the focus of research for its metabolic effects in vitro. In the present study , the in vivo effects of CGRP on epididymal fat pads lipolysis at rest and during exercise were investigated in trained male Wistar rats. Male Wistar rats were assigned to control and trained groups , which underwent endurance training for 12 weeks. The control ( at rest) and trained ( during acute exercise) animals were subjected to an intravenous injection of rat recombinant CGRP ( 2 µg kg Intravenous injection of rat CGRP recombinant at rest upregulated major lipolysis pathways ( cyclic AMP ( cAMP) , AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK) , and phospholipase C ( PIPLC/IP Epididymal fat pads is a metabolic target for CGRP during exercise and CGRP effects on adipose tissue metabolism during exercise could be related to PIPLC/IP
