 Single-wall carbon nanotubes ( SWCNTs) , especially in the form of large-area and high-quality thin films , are a promising material for use in flexible and transparent electronics. Here , a continuous synthesis , deposition , and transfer technique is reported for the fabrication of meter-scale SWCNT thin films , which have an excellent optoelectrical performance including a low sheet resistance of 65 Ω/ ◽ with a transmittance of 90 % at a wavelength of 550 nm. Using these SWCNT thin films , high-performance all-CNT thin-film transistors and integrated circuits are demonstrated , including 101-stage ring oscillators. The results pave the way for the future development of large-scale , flexible , and transparent electronics based on CNT thin films.
