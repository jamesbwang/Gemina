 The high toxicity , poor stability , premature drug release , and lack of intracellular stimuli responsibility of current polymeric micelles still hinder them for potential clinical applications. To address these challenges , a novel type of multi-stimuli responsive , core cross-linked polypeptide hybrid micelles ( CCMs) was developed for triggered anticancer drug delivery in tumor microenvironment. The CCMs was prepared via free radical copolymerization by using N , N '- methylene-bis-acylamide ( BACy) as the cross-linking agent , 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile ( AIBN) as the initiator , where poly ( γ-benzyl-L-glutamate) ( PBLG) and N-isopropylacrylamide ( NIPPAM) as comonomers. The doxorubicin ( DOX) was then introduced into the CCMs by hydrazone bond to prepare the drug-incorporated core cross-linked micelles ( CCMs-DOX). By the experimental results , the CCMs showed reduction responsibility due to the degradable disulfide bond in the polymer network. The hydrazone bond can be broken under acidic condition causing a controllable drug release for CCMs-DOX. Compared to only 7.7 % DOX release under pH 7.4 at 37 °C , a much higher DOX release rate up to 85.3 % was observed under 10 mM GSH ( pH 5.0 , 42 °C). In vitro cell assays showed that the blank CCMs showed almost no toxicity against HUVEC cells while the CCMS-DOX exhibited significant cancer cell killing effect. These experimental results suggested that the prepared multi-stimuli responsive polymeric micelles could serve as a smart and promising drug delivery candidate for anti-cancer therapy.
