 Two-dimensional ( 2D) material-based heterostructures provide a unique platform where interactions between stacked 2D layers can enhance the electrical and opto-electrical properties as well as give rise to interesting new phenomena. Here , the operation of a van der Waals heterostructure device comprising of vertically stacked bilayer MoS
