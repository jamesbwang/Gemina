 To assess trends in prevalence of cigar and blunt use in relation to cigarette use among pregnant and nonpregnant women of reproductive age. We used 2006 to 2016 data from the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health to assess past-month use of cigarettes , cigars , and blunts among a total of 8695 pregnant women and 162451 nonpregnant women aged 18 to 44 years. Cigarette use was more prevalent than cigar or blunt use in pregnant and nonpregnant women , with higher prevalence in nonpregnant women for each product. Among all women , cigarette use decreased and blunt use increased over time , whereas cigar use remained stable. Smoking prevalence was highest in the first trimester. The health implications of the increase in blunt use are not well known in the scientific literature or by the general public. Given the rapid changes in state marijuana laws , this issue should be a public health priority.
