 In contrast to many studies exploring barriers to preventive care in family medicine , there is less quantitative research regarding the self-perceived role of family physicians ( FPs) in prevention and its predictive factors. Moreover , the existing studies considered this attitude as a homogeneous entity. The objective of this study is firstly , to characterize FPs ' attitudes towards prevention taking into account nine different prevention themes , and secondly , to explore the factors that could be predictive of this attitude. The data stem from a cross-sectional national survey on prevention we conducted in Switzerland from 2015 to 2016 ( 170 physicians randomly drawn , online questionnaire). We first performed a confirmatory factor analysis to define a homogeneous latent variable regarding physicians ' attitude towards prevention , then , a structural equation modeling to identify potential predictors. The FP ' attitude towards their role in preventive care was homogeneously positive whatever the topic ( smoking , drinking dietary habits , physical activities , and more generally , cardiovascular risk factors) except for occupational risks and cannabis consumption. A feeling of good effectiveness was a positive predictor of this positive attitude while seniority , the lack of reimbursement and being a physician from the German-speaking area were negative predictors. The FP ' attitude about their role in prevention is homogeneous concerning the ` classical ' topics of prevention , whereas they still under-recognize certain topics as important fields for prevention. To change this situation , we probably need a global effort to introduce other ways of thinking about prevention , including not only FP but also all stakeholders.
