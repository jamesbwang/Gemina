 Photolithographic fabrication of unique microstructures composed of flexible hydrogel sheets is proposed and demonstrated by using photo-acid-generating poly ( methyl methacrylate). Crosslinking of a hydroxyl-rich polymer and lifting off of the crosslinked polymer layer from the substrate are controlled respectively in an area-selective manner upon micropatterned light irradiation , and various pocket-like microstructures are fabricated resultantly.
