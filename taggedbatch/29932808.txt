 ` Shielding ' effect of a conjugated PEG molecule could cause a change in the electrostatic interaction characteristics of a PEGylate. We investigated how PEG chain length ( or molecular weight) alters the electrostatic interaction potential of exenatide variants using their mono-PEGylates in a branched and linear form as model PEGylates. First , we performed the experiments to demonstrate the elution time changes of the mono-PEGylates conjugated with various MW PEGs ( 5 , 10 , 20 , and 40 kD) using cation exchange chromatography ( HiTrap
