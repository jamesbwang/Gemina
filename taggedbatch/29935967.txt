 The textile dyeing industry is one of the main sectors contributing to environmental pollution , due to the generation of large amounts of wastewater loaded with dyes ( ca. 2-50 % of the initial amount of dyes used in the dye baths is lost) , causing severe impacts on human health and the environment. In this context , an ecotoxicity testing battery was used to assess the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the textile dyes Direct Black 38 ( DB38; azo dye) and Reactive Blue 15 ( RB15; copper phthalocyanine dye) on different trophic levels. Thus these dyes were tested using the following assays: Filter paper contact test with earthworms ( Eisenia foetida); seed germination and root elongation toxicity test ( Cucumis sativus , Lactuca sativa and Lycopersicon esculentum); acute immobilization test ( Daphnia magna<pathogen> and Artemia salina); and the Comet assay with the rainbow<disease> trout gonad-2 cell fish line ( RTG-2) and D. magna<pathogen>. Neither phytotoxicity nor significant effects on the survival of E. foetida were observed after exposure to DB38 and RB15. Both dyes were classified as relatively non-toxic to D. magna<pathogen> ( LC
