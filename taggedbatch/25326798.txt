 Endothelial cells ( ECs) contribute to haematopoietic stem cell ( HSC) maintenance in bone<disease> marrow , but the differential contributions of EC subtypes remain unknown , owing to the lack of methods to separate with high purity arterial endothelial cells ( AECs) from sinusoidal endothelial cells ( SECs). Here we show that the combination of podoplanin ( PDPN) and Sca-1 expression distinguishes AECs ( CD45
