 In this study , bimetallic nanoscale zero-valent iron particles ( nZVI) , including copper/nanoscale zero-valent iron particles ( Cu/nZVI) and nickel/nanoscale zero-valent iron particles ( Ni/nZVI) , were synthesized by one-step liquid-phase reduction and applied for oxytetracycline ( OTC) removal. The effects of contact time and initial pH on the removal efficiency were studied. The as-prepared nanoscale particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , energy dispersive spectroscopy ( EDS) and X-ray diffraction ( XRD). Finally , the degradation mechanisms of OTC utilizing the as-prepared nanoparticles were investigated by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) and mass spectrometry ( MS). Cu/nZVI presented remarkable ability for OTC degradation and removed 71.44 % of OTC ( 100mg/L) in 4 hr , while only 62.34 % and 31.05 % of OTC was degraded by Ni/nZVI and nZVI respectively. XPS and MS analysis suggested that OTC was broken down to form small molecules by Â· OH radicals generated from the corrosion of Fe
