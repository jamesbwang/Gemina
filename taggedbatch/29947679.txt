 The objective of the study was to conduct a systematic review to synthesize the current evidence on the accuracy of IgM and IgA to early diagnosis the dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen>. The review protocol was registered at PROSPERO ( CRD 42015024808). We searched for studies in the following electronic database from 1990 to January 2018. The search identified 3507 studies. Five studies were included for quantitative analysis. Three studies included evaluations of salivary IgM provided a sensitivity of 86 % and specificity of 93 %. Two studies included evaluating of IgA salivary showed a combined sensitivity of 69 % and a combined specificity of 98 %. Despite the results found and the low methodological quality of the studies included in the meta-analysis it is still soon to claim that IgA is better than IgM to diagnosis Dengue<pathogen><disease>.
