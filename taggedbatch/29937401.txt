 Histone deacetylase 6 ( HDAC6) acts by enzyme-dependent and- independent mechanisms to regulate diverse cellular processes including autophagy , the ubiquitin proteasome system , and cell migration. HDAC6 also has emerging roles in innate immunity , including pathogen sensing and destruction , thus placing this enzyme at the crossroads of infection and innate immunity.
