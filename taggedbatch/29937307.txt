 Advances brought about by omics-based approaches have revolutionized our understanding of the diversity and ecological processes involving marine archaea , bacteria , and their viruses. This broad review discusses recent examples of how genomics , metagenomics , and ecogenomics have been applied to reveal the ecology of these biological entities. Three major topics are covered in this revision: ( i) the novel roles of microorganisms in ecosystem processes; ( ii) virus-host associations; and ( iii) ecological associations of microeukaryotes and other microbes. We also briefly comment on the discovery of novel taxa from marine ecosystems; development of a robust taxonomic framework for prokaryotes; breakthroughs on the diversity and ecology of cyanobacteria; and advances on ecological modelling. We conclude by discussing limitations of the field and suggesting directions for future research.
