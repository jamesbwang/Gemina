 In this critical Review we focus on the evolution of the hybrid ion capacitor ( HIC) from its early embodiments to its modern form , focusing on the key outstanding scientific and technological questions that necessitate further in-depth study. It may be argued that HICs began as aqueous systems , based on a Faradaic oxide positive electrode ( e.g. , Co
