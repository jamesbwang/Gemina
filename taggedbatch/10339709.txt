 Rhabdomyolysis owing to status epilepticus ( SE) can be life-threating , with acute kidney injury ( AKI) the most serious complication; therefore , early recognition of the risk factors is important. Hyperuricemia after epileptic<symptom> seizures<symptom> has been reported , and severe hyperuricemia can lead to acute<symptom> renal function damage. We present the case of a 21-year-old man hospitalized for SE , who had especially high level of blood uric acid ( UA) at initial presentation. The patient was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis due to SE. The patient was treated with hydration and bicarbonate therapy. But he developed acute kidney failure ( AKF) and hemodialysis was performed. After hemodialysis , his symptoms disappeared and laboratory data returned to normal. Hyperuricemia after SE might indicate severe<symptom> muscle damage or reduced clearance of metabolites , and could be a risk factor for kidney dysfunction , especially with rhabdomyolysis. To our knowledge , this is the first report of rhabdomyolysis following SE with hyperuricemia.
