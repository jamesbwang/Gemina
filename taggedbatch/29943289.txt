 SPL is a plant-specific transcription factor family. Many researchers reported that SPL members targeted by miR156s could play crucial roles in the modulation of plant growth and development. Although there are similar reports on grapes , till now little is known about grape berry development and ripening. To gain more insight into how grape miR156s ( Vv-miR156s) modulated the above given processes of grape berries by mediating their target gene Vv-SPLs , here we identified the precise sequences of Vv-miR156s in ` Giant Rose ' grape berries , predicted their potential targets , and revealed that the matching degree of various Vv-miR156: Vv-SPL pairs exhibited some discrepancy , implying the divergence of their interaction. Subsequently , we also discovered similar motifs such as ABRE , CGTCA and ERE , which are more specific to berry development and ripening , within the promoters of both Vv-MIR156s and Vv-SPLs. With berry development and ripening , meanwhile , Vv-miR156a , b/c/d , e and f/g/i exhibited an overall increasing expression trend , while their targets showed opposite trends at the corresponding stages. Additionally , exogenous ABA and NAA application promoted or curbed the expression of Vv-miR156s to some extent , before grape berry ripening stage. The cleavage products , sites and frequencies of Vv-miR156a , b/c/d , e , f/g/i and their respective targets ( Vv-SPL2 , 9 , 10 , 16) during grape berry development and ripening process were validated by our developed PPM-RACE and modified RLM-RACE together with qRT-PCR , which demonstrated that Vv-miR156s can be involved in the modulation of grape berry development and ripening process by mediating the expression of Vv-SPL2 , 9 , 10 , 16. Our findings lay an important foundation for further recognizing their functions in grape berries , and enrich the knowledge of the regulatory mechanism of miRNA-mediated grape berry development and ripening.
