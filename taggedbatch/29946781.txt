 Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases in the world , especially within the past few decades , causing over half a million deaths a year in the USA only ( 1). Despite recent advances made in the field of cancer biology and the therapies that have been developed , it is clear that more advances are necessary for us to classify cancer as curable. The logical question that arises is simple: Why , despite all the technologies and medical innovations of our time , has a cure eluded us? This chapter will shed light on one of cancer 's most impactful attributes: its heterogeneity and , more specifically , the intratumoral heterogeneity of cancer metabolism. Simply put , what makes cancer one of the deadliest known diseases is its ability to change and adapt. Cancer cells ' rapid evolution , coupled with their irrepressible ability to divide , gives them the advantage over our immune systems. In this chapter , we will delve into the complexities of this adaptability and the vital role that metabolism plays in the rise and progression of this heterogeneity.
