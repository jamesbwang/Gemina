 To investigate the effects of total flavonids of astragalus ( TFA) on arrhythmia , endoplasmic reticulum stress and connexcin in mice with viral myocarditis<disease> and to clarify the mechanisms of TFA against viral myocarditis<disease> complicated with arrhythmia. Thirty-six male Balb/c mice were randomly divided into control group , viral myocarditis<disease> group and total flavonoids group ( The expressions of GRP78 and ATF4 were increased and the expression of Cx43 was decreased in viral myocarditis<disease> , while TFA inhibited these effect of viral myocarditis<disease> in heart of mice. The antiarrhythmic effect of TFA may be related to the alleviation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the increase of Cx43 expression.
