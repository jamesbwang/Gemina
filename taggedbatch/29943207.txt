 Ankylosing spondylitis ( AS) is an inflammatory rheumatic disease affecting mainly the axial skeleton and sacroiliac joints. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of inspiratory muscle training ( IMT) on respiratory<symptom> muscles and functional exercise capacity , as well as on the specific outcomes of the disease in AS patients. A total of 32 AS patients ( mean age 37.37 ± 10.41 years) were randomly assigned as the Training Group ( TG) ( n = 16 , mean age = 35.62 ± 8.18 years) who received IMT + conventional exercise , and the Control Group ( CG) ( n = 16 , mean age = 39.12 ± 12.26 years) who only performed the conventional exercise program. All the subjects were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the 8th week. Respiratory<symptom> muscle strength was assessed by measuring the maximal inspiratory pressure ( PImax) and maximal expiratory pressure ( PEmax). Functional exercise capacity was measured using the 6-min walk test ( 6MWT). The Bath AS Disease Activity Index ( BASDAI) , Bath AS Disease Function Index and Bath AS Metrology Index were used for activity , function and basic measurements of the disease. A statistically significant improvement was determined in the PImax ( p = 0.000) , PEmax ( p = 0.002) , 6MWT ( p = 0.041) and BASDAI ( p = 0.049) values in the TG after training. There was a significant difference between baseline and after conventional exercise in terms of PEmax ( p = 0.017) in the CG. The PEmax ( p = 0.001) and the 6MWT ( p = 0.053) values were significantly better in the TG. The results of this study demonstrated that IMT in addition to conventional exercises increased inspiratory muscle strength , functional exercise capacity and positively affected the disease activity in AS.
