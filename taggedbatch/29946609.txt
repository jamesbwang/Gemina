 Here we report the 18F labeling of a prostate specific membrane antigen ( PSMA) ligand via a strain promoted oxa-dibenzocyclooctyne ( ODIBO)- or bicyclo ( 6.1.0) nonyne ( BCN)- azide reaction. Although ODIBO reacts with azide 20 fold faster than BCN , in vivo PET imaging suggests that 18F-BCN-azide-PSMA demonstrated much higher tumor uptake and a much higher tumor to background contrast.
