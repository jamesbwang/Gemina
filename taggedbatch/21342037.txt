 Herein , we report the synthesis of different novel sets of coumarin-6-sulfonamide derivatives bearing different functionalities ( 4a , b , 8a-d , 11a-d , 13a , b , and 15a-c) , and in vitro evaluation of their growth inhibitory activity towards the proliferation of three cancer cell lines; HepG2 ( hepatocellular carcinoma) , MCF-7 ( breast cancer) , and Caco-2 ( colon cancer). HepG2 cells were the most sensitive cells to the influence of the target coumarins. Compounds 13a and 15a emerged as the most active members against HepG2 cells ( IC
