 Biclustering is an unsupervised technique of simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of input matrix. With multiple biclustering algorithms proposed , UniBic remains one of the most accurate methods developed so far. In this paper we introduce a Bioconductor package called runibic with parallel implementation of UniBic. For the convenience the algorithm was reimplemented , parallelized , and wrapped within an R package called runibic. The package includes: ( 1) a couple of times faster parallel version of the original sequential algorithm , ( 2) much more efficient memory management , ( 3) modularity which allows to build new methods on top of the provided one , and ( 4) integration with the modern Bioconductor packages such as SummarizedExperiment , ExpressionSet and biclust. The package is implemented inR ( 3.4) and is available from Bioconductor ( 3.6) at the following URL http://bioconductor.org/packages/runibic with installation instructions and tutorial. Supplementary informations are available in vignette of the package.
