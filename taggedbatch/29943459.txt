 Genetic background influences allergic immune responses to environmental stimuli. Non-obese diabetic ( NOD) mice are highly susceptible to environmental stimuli. Little is known about the interaction of autoimmune genetic factors with innate immunity in allergies , especially skin hypersensitivity<disease>. To study the interplay of innate immunity and autoimmune genetic factors in contact hypersensitivity<disease> ( CHS) by using various innate immunity-deficient NOD mice. Toll-like receptor ( TLR) 2-deficient , TLR9-deficient and MyD88-deficient NOD mice were used to investigate CHS. The cellular mechanism was determined by flow cytometry in vitro and adoptive cell transfer in vivo. To investigate the role of MyD88 in dendritic cells ( DCs) in CHS , we also used CD11c We found that innate immunity negatively regulates CHS , as innate immunity-deficient NOD mice developed exacerbated CHS accompanied by increased numbers of skin-migrating CD11c Our results suggest that the autoimmune-prone NOD genetic background aggravates CHS regulated by innate immunity , through DCs and T effector cells.
