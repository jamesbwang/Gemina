 In this study , we describe development of a true matched-pair theranostic agent that is able to target the Î± We have previously described the development of ( RGD-Glu-6Ahx-RM2) ( where RGD: Arg-Gly-Asp; Glu: glutamic acid; 6-Ahx: 6-amino hexanoic acid; RM2: ( D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2)) that has been conjugated to a DOTA ( 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) bifunctional chelating agent ( BFCA) to afford ( RGD-Glu- ( DO3A) -6-Ahx-RM2) peptide. In this study , we have radiolabeled ( RGD-Glu- ( DO3A) -6-Ahx-RM2) peptide with Competitive displacement binding assays in PC-3 cells showed high binding affinity for the GRPR ( IC The ( RGD-Glu- ( ( The theranostic , heterobivalent , agents described herein perform comparably with other mono- and multivalent conjugates we have reported and offer the potential of improved sensitivity for detecting prostate cancer cells that might exhibit differing profiles of receptor expression on tumor cells in human patients.
