 Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests ( OHCA) among infants or toddlers mainly occur at home. Therefore , parents with children should be able to perform immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR) when they witness OHCA. However , the status of knowledge regarding CPR among parents remains unclear. The aim of our study was to determine the factors associated with awareness of CPR among parents with 3-year-old children. We analysed a subset of data from a population-based , cross-sectional survey that served as an evaluation of a national campaign for maternal and child health in Japan. The questionnaire was distributed to 32,897 parents who visited public health centers for medical check-ups for their children in 2013. Demographic data for the study population were obtained and analysed via multivariate logistic regression analyses. Overall , 26,971 parents ( 82.0 %) responded to the questionnaire. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that birth order of the child , age of the mother at delivery , awareness of medical facilities for emergency services at night or during the weekend , current occupational status of the mother , and current economic status were independently associated with CPR awareness. When the mother was employed but the parents felt economically insufficient , the probability of having CPR knowledge decreased by 19 %. Regardless of the parents ' economic stability , the probability of having CPR knowledge declined by > 35 % when the mother was unemployed. The current occupational status of mothers and the current economic status of families should be considered when planning educational strategies regarding CPR among parents.
