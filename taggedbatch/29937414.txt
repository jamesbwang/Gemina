 Avian malaria<disease> is the oldest experimental system for investigating the biology and transmission of Plasmodium<pathogen><disease> parasites. Recent molecular protocols for detecting and characterizing avian malaria<disease> lineages in the field are providing an ever-growing picture of the prevalence , distribution , host range , and diversity hotspots of avian malaria<disease> across the world. The unparalleled genetic diversity uncovered rivals anything that has been found in other vertebrate malarias<disease> and seems to be matched by an equally rich phenotypic diversity , providing endless opportunities for exploring the selective pressures under which hosts and parasites evolve. We review the most important milestones in avian Plasmodium<pathogen><disease> research and explain why this is a unique animal model to understand the ecology and evolution of malaria<disease>.
