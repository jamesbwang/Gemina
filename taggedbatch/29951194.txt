 In this article , we review methods for localization and situational awareness of biped and quadruped robotics. This type of robot is modelled as a free-floating mechanical system subject to external forces and constrained by whole-body distributed rigid contacts. Measurements of the state of the robot can be made using a variety of sensor information-such as kinematics ( the sensing of the joint angles of the robot) , contact force ( pressure sensors in the robot 's feet) , accelerometers and gyroscopes as well as external sensors such as vision and LIDAR. This high-frequency state estimate is then passed to the control system of the robot to allow it to traverse terrain or manipulate its environment. In this article , we describe the development of an estimator for the Boston Dynamics Atlas humanoid robot. It was later adapted to the HyQ2 quadruped , developed by the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia. Some discussion is given as to future trends while also considering briefly the relationship with biological systems.
