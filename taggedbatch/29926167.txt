 Human gut microbiota is involved in host health and disease development. Investigations of age-related and sex-related alterations in gut microbiota are limited , and the association between stool<symptom> consistency and gut microbiota has not been fully investigated. We investigated gut microbiota differences related to age , sex , and stool<symptom> consistency in healthy Japanese subjects. Two-hundred and seventy-seven healthy Japanese subjects aged 20-89 years were enrolled. Fecal samples were obtained to analyze the gut microbiome. We evaluated the association between stool<symptom> consistency ( Bristol stool<symptom> scale ( BSS)) and gut microbiota. Although there were significant differences in the microbial structure between males and females , the Î±-diversity of gut microbiota showed no difference between males and females or among age groups. There were significant increases in genera Prevotella<pathogen> , Megamonas , Fusobacterium<pathogen> , and Megasphaera and Bifidobacterium<pathogen> , Ruminococcus , and Akkermansia in males and females , respectively. The ratio of hard stools<symptom> ( BSS types 1 and 2) was higher in females; the ratio of loose stools<symptom> ( BSS type 6) was higher in males. No younger male had BSS type 1 or type 2. Fusobacterium<pathogen> in males was significantly higher in the loose consistency group , and Oscillospira was significantly higher in the hard consistency group in males; Campylobacter<pathogen> , SMB53 , and Turicibacter were significantly higher in the hard consistency group in females. Several changes in gut microbiota were associated with age and sex. Stool<symptom> consistency and gut microbiota associations emphasized the importance of stool<symptom> consistency assessments to understand intestinal function.
