 To investigate the role and potential mechanism of human serum albumin ( hsa)- micro ribonucleic acid ( miR) -382-5p in epidural fibrosis<disease> formation after laminectomy. Cells were transfected with miR-382-5p mimic or miR-382-5p inhibitor. Then , 3- ( 4,5)- dimethylthiahiazol (- z-y1) -3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide ( MTT) assay was employed to detect the effect of miR-382-5p on proliferation , and Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to examine the expressions of miR-382-5p and fibrosis-related proteins after treatment with transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-β). Luciferase assay and immunofluorescent staining were done to confirm whether collagen I A1 is a target of miR-382-5p. MTT assay demonstrated that miR-382-5p had no significant effect on fibroblast proliferation. Expressions of miR-382-5p and fibrosis-related proteins were remarkably increased after TGF-β treatment. Collagen I A1 was acknowledged as a target of miR-382-5p. MiR-382-5p mimic statistically enhanced the level of collagen I A1 , and miR-382-5p enhanced the expressions of collagen I A1. Increased miR-382-5p promotes epidural fibrosis<disease> by increasing collagen I A1 expression , and miR-382-5p may be a potential novel molecular target for the treatment of epidural fibrosis<disease>.
