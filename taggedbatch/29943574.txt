 We report a new efficient exciplex-forming system consisting of a biscarbazole donor and a triazine-based acceptor. The new exciplex was characterized with a high photoluminescence quantum yield up to 68 % and effective thermally activated delayed fluorescence behavior. The BCzPh: 3P-T2T ( 2:1 , 30 nm) blend was examined not only as an emitting layer ( device D1) but also a reliable co-host of fluorescent and phosphorescent emitters for giving highly efficient exciplex-based organic light-emitting diodes ( OLEDs) with a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 15.5 and 29.7 % for devices doped with 1 wt % C545T ( device D2) and 8 wt % Ir ( ppy)
