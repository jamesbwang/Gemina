 To compare perioperative outcomes of robotic single-site ( RSS) surgery with conventional single-port laparoendoscopic surgery for the treatment of advanced-stage endometriosis. This is a retrospective cohort study that included 120 patients who received single-port laparoendoscopic surgery or RSS surgery for the treatment of advanced-stage endometriosis at Ewha Womans University 's Mokdong Hospital in Seoul , Korea between December 2014 and May 2017. Single-port laparoendoscopic cystectomy and adhesiolysis were performed in 52 patients ( Single-port laparoendoscopic ( SPL) group) and RSS cystectomy and adhesiolysis were performed in 68 patients ( RSS group). Perioperative outcomes that we analyzed , included age , operative time , estimated blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , length of hospital stay , size of endometriosis , laterality of endometriosis , degree of endometriosis infiltration ( i.e. , deep versus not) , and recurrence. The patients in both groups were of similar ages. Longer operative times ( 107.8 ± 37.6 min for RSS group versus 76.9 ± 46.4 min for SPL group , P = .001) and more estimated blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( 106.67 ± 171.67 mL for RSS group versus 57.1 ± 44.9 mL for SPL group , P = .001) were measured in the RSS group. However , the mean size of endometriosis was statistically larger ( 5.23 ± 2.53 cm for RSS group versus 4.37 ± 2.14 cm for SPL group , P = .030) and higher rates of more deeply infiltrative endometriosis ( 52 cases in RSS group , 76.5 % versus 33 cases in SPL group , 63.5 %) were observed in RSS group. Multicystic endometriosis occurred in 26 cases in the RSS group ( 38.2 %). No significant differences were seen in terms of length of hospital stay ( 4.58 ± 0.61 of SPL group versus 4.59 ± 0.58 of RSS group , P = .862) or intraoperative and postoperative complications between the groups. Recurrence occurred in one case in the RSS group ( 1.9 %). RSS surgery can be used in the treatment of advanced-stage endometriosis , especially in more complicated cases.
