 Exome-sequencing for somatic mutation detection and copy number variation analysis are effective and valid methods for evaluating human cancers in current molecular medicine. We conducted target amplicon exome-sequencing analyses using PCR target enrichment and next-generation sequencing on Ion Proton semiconductor sequencers. Twenty-seven primary central nervous system lymphoma ( PCNSL) specimens and their corresponding noncancerous tissues were used for multiplex PCR amplification to obtain targeted coverages of the entire coding regions of 409 cancer-related genes. The average of the total numbers of somatic mutations including single-nucleotide variations and insertion/deletion mutations in each specimen was 13.3. Of these , the average of the ratios of nonsynonymous substitutions in each specimen was 74.8 %. The most frequent mutations in 27 specimens were in
