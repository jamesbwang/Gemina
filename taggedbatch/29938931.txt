 The aim of the present study was to verify the usefulness of Point Aa as a substitute marker of the Q-tip angle and urethral mobility before and after midurethral sling operation for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence ( SUI) in women. In this study , 118 women presenting with SUI who underwent the tension-free vaginal tape obturator ( TVTO) procedure were prospectively examined and followed-up for ≥ 6 months after operation. Spearman 's correlation coefficient was used to assess the degree of correlation between Point Aa of the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system and Q-tip angles before and after midurethral sling surgery. There were significant postoperative changes in Point Aa ( from -0.4 ± 1.9 to -2.7 ± 0.6; P = .001) and Q-tip angle ( from 58.7 ± 19.4 to 15.4 ± 17.5 degrees; P = .001) compared with preoperative values. A fair correlation between Point Aa position and straining Q-tip angle was found before ( r = 0.45 , P = .05) and after ( r = 0.49 , P = .04) the procedure , with no significant difference in values before and after the procedure ( P = .62). The results of the present study show fair correlation between the Point Aa position and straining Q-tip angle before and after midurethral sling surgery. Point Aa could be used as an indicator of urethral mobility after the TVTO procedure in women with SUI.
