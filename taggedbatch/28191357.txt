 To compare the results respectively obtained from the utilization of 60 % barium sulfate suspension and Iohexol as contrast agents for videofluoroscopic swallowing studies and the relationship between the clinical application of the two kinds of contrast agents and the incidence of pneumonia<disease>. Sixty cases of stroke patients with dysphagia<symptom> were selected in rehabilitation department of our hospital , and the gender , age , position of the disease , and stroke nature between groups had no significant difference. Among which , 30 patients who were administered 350 mgI/ml Iohexol , and the other 30 patients with 60 % barium sulfate suspension as contrast agent. We performed videofluoroscopic swallowing studies with barium 60 % versus Iohexol within 1 week after admission and 2 weeks after admission. After 2 weeks in hospital , the aspiration pneumonia<disease> incidence of two groups was statistically significant ( p < 0.05) , the pneumonia<disease> incidence of Iohexol group was lower than barium sulfate group which might have a impossble relevance with barium aspiration. During the videofluoroscopic swallowing study of dysphagia<symptom> after stroke , barium sulfate can enhance the pneumonia<disease> incidence , and Iohexol can be widely applied in videofluoroscopic swallowing study.
