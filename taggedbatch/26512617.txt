 IgG4-related disease ( IgG4-RD) is an emerging immune-mediated disease characterized by multi-organ involvement and variable clinical behavior. We describe the case of a 50-year-old woman affected by a rare variant of IgG4-RD , characterized by eyelid xanthelasmas , adult-onset asthma and salivary and lacrimal glands enlargement. Multiple lymphadenopathies and a pulmonary mass were present at initial evaluation. After a single course of rituximab ( 2g in 2 refracted doses) , an almost complete clinical remission was achieved without chronic steroid administration. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) , high-resolution computed tomography ( HRCT) of the thorax , and positron emission tomography ( 18FDG-PET-CT) confirmed good response to treatment. Circulating plasmablasts dropped to undetectable levels as well. Xanthelasmas only remained unchanged. Remission persisted at 1-year follow-up. Steroid therapy is still considered standard first-line therapy in IgG4-RD. However , high doses are generally required and relapses are common during the tapering phase. Rituximab is a well described steroid-sparing strategy , so far reserved to refractory cases only. In our experience , rituximab has been used as first-line monotherapy , showing great and sustained efficacy and optimal tolerability. The peculiar variant of IgG4-RD affecting our patient , the relatively low baseline plasmablast concentration , and the early placement of rituximab therapy may have facilitated the good response.
