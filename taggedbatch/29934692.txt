 A study was conducted to investigate genetic diversity of Echinococcus isolates collected in Hungarian slaughterhouses between 2015 and 2018. Organs of 219 animals with suspected hydatidosis were collected during routine meat inspection and sent to our laboratory. Echinococcus infection was confirmed in 65 animals. These results indicate that prevalence data based on reporting of slaughterhouses are not reliable without the appropriate training of the people responsible for meat inspection. The genetic diversity was evaluated by the DNA sequence analysis of the cytochrome c oxydase subunit 1 ( cox1) mitochondrial gene. Echinococcus intermedius<pathogen> ( n = 31) , Echinococcus granulosus<pathogen> s.s. ( n = 2) , and Echinococcus multilocularis ( n = 3) was identified in swine. In cattle , only E. granulosus s.s. ( n = 20) was detected. E. granulosus s.s. ( n = 7) was the dominant species in sheep; nevertheless , E. intermedius<pathogen> was also identified in two animals. E. granulosus s.s. ( n = 29) and E. intermedius<pathogen> ( n = 33) were classified in 13 and three haplotypes , respectively. The genetic diversity and haplotype network of E. granulosus s.s. were similar to that observed in some other countries of Eastern Europe. The genetic diversity of E. intermedius<pathogen> was low with a single dominant haplotype. Cysts<symptom> were fertile in nine sheep ( 100 %) , 22 swine ( 61 %) , and three cattle ( 15 %) indicating that all three species play a role in some extent in the epidemiology of cystic echinococcosis in Hungary. Based on the number of animals killed in the slaughterhouses involved in the present study , the rate of infection was 0.013 % in sheep , 0.007 % in cattle , and 0.001 % in swine. As animals with hydatidosis originated from family farms , control programs should mainly focus on these facilities.
