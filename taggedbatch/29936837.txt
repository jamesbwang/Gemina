 The characterization of prenucleation species is essential to understand crystallization mechanisms across many chemical systems and often involves the use of vibrational spectroscopy. Nowhere is this more evident than in the development of `` green '' aluminum processing technologies , where detailed understanding of the speciation of aluminum and its polynuclear analogues in highly alkaline , low water solutions is elusive. The aluminate anion Al ( OH)
