 The fundamental challenge of modern genetic analysis is to establish gene-phenotype correlations that are often found in the large-scale publications. Because lexical features of gene are relatively regular in text , the main challenge of these relation extraction is phenotype recognition. Due to phenotypic descriptions are often study- or author-specific , few lexicon can be used to effectively identify the entire phenotypic expressions in text , especially for plants. We have proposed a pipeline for extracting phenotype , gene and their relations from biomedical literature. Combined with abbreviation revision and sentence template extraction , we improved the unsupervised word-embedding-to-sentence-embedding cascaded approach as representation learning to recognize the various broad phenotypic information in literature. In addition , the dictionary- and rule-based method was applied for gene recognition. Finally , we integrated one of famous information extraction system OLLIE to identify gene-phenotype relations. To demonstrate the applicability of the pipeline , we established two types of comparison experiment using model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. In the comparison of state-of-the-art baselines , our approach obtained the best performance ( F1-Measure of 66.83 %). We also applied the pipeline to 481 full-articles from TAIR gene-phenotype manual relationship dataset to prove the validity. The results showed that our proposed pipeline can cover 70.94 % of the original dataset and add 373 new relations to expand it.
