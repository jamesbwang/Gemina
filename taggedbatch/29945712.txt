 Supra-ventricular tachyarrhythmia and its treatment have been poorly investigated in ICU patients. To evaluate efficacy and safety of cardioversion for supra-ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the intensive care unit ( ICU). Prospective inclusion of all patients who presented supra-ventricular tachyarrhythmias lasting â‰¥ 30seconds in a single medico-surgical ICU , except cardiac surgery. Anti-arrhythmic drugs and/or direct-current cardioversion were administered on a liberal basis. During the 15-month study period , 108/846 patients ( 12.8 %) experienced supra-ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Anti-arrhythmic drugs were administered in 78 patients ( 72 %); mostly amiodarone ( 92 %) , and/or magnesium ( 23 %) , resulting in an overall conversion rate of 68 %. Direct-current cardioversion was used in 26 patients ( 24 %) , ( 24 patients received drug enhancement by anti-arrhythmic drugs) with an immediate 80.8 %- success rate. Direct-current cardioversion was associated with sustained conversion to sinus rhythm in 80.8 % of ICU patients with supra-ventricular tachyarrhythmias , although most of them had already received drug enhancement.
