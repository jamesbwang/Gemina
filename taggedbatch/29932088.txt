 Confectionery is one of the potential sources of contamination and transmission of gastrointestinal<disease> infections<disease> to humans. Staphylococcus<pathogen> species , and particularly the coagulase-positive ones , have the remarkable capability to produce high amounts of enterotoxin in food. In the present study , the frequency and diversity of Staphylococcus<pathogen> in confectioneries in Iran were assessed by using a combination of conventional and molecular methods. A total of 55 confection samples were collected from 30 confectioneries of Isfahan. They were analyzed for the presence of Staphylococcus<pathogen> using standard protocols for isolation and characterization of the isolates. The conventional tests were used for primary identification and the sequence analysis of 16S rRNA was used for the species identification. A total of 47 out of 55 samples were gram-positive cocci ( 85.45 %). They belonged to 39 Staphylococcus<pathogen> spp. , 7 Macrococcus spp. , and one Micrococcus<pathogen> spp.. The most prevalent 11 various Staphylococcus<pathogen> species were S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> 30.8 % , S.<pathogen> warneri<pathogen> 20.5 % and S. succinus 17.9. Identification and characterization of Staphylococcus<pathogen> species can be important for epidemiological investigations and assessment of virulence factors such as enterotoxin production and development of specific management practices to prevent staphylococcal food<disease> poisoning<disease>.
