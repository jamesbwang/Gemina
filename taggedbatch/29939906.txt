 Acute pancreatitis<disease> ( AP) is a common and severe gastrointestinal inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> with poorly understood pathogenesis. We adopted cerulein-induced pancreatitis<disease> , a well-established rat model shearing similarities with human AP , to determine the disease background. Special interest was placed on sphingolipids , because their signaling pathways are involved in many pathological states including hepatic steatosis , heart infarction , or pancreatic origin type 1 diabetes. Sphingolipid levels in the blood and pancreas were determined by the means of chromatography ( thin-layer and high-performance liquid chromatography). We found that AP leads to activation of ceramide de novo synthesis pathway , as evidenced by a significant increment in sphinganine , that is , ceramide synthesis precursor , content ( +3.8-fold). Surprisingly , despite the reported growth in sphinganine concentration , we observed a reduced ( -38 %) ceramide level in the pancreas of rats with AP. The results could be explained by subsequent hydrolysis of ceramide to other secondary messengers , that is , sphingosine ( +4-fold) or sphingosine-1-phosphate ( +3-fold). Because it is known that sphingosine-1-phosphate and some of its analogs could have a protective role against AP complications , our findings may contribute to elaboration of new therapeutic strategies in the management of this severe medical condition.
