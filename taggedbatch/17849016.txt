 Infection prior to reproduction usually carries greater fitness costs for hosts than infection later in life , suggesting selection should tend to favour juvenile resistance. Yet , juveniles are generally more susceptible than adults across a wide spectrum of host taxa. While physiological constraints and a lack of prior exposure can explain some of this pattern , studies in plants and insects suggest that hosts may trade off juvenile susceptibility against other life-history traits. However , it is unclear precisely how trade-offs shape the evolution of juvenile susceptibility. Here , we theoretically explore the evolution of juvenile susceptibility subject to trade-offs with maturation or reproduction , which could realistically occur due to resource allocation during development ( e.g. prioritizing growth over immune defence). We show how host lifespan , the probability of maturation ( i.e. of reaching the adult stage) and transmission mode affect the results. Our key finding is that elevated juvenile susceptibility is expected to evolve over a wide range of conditions , but should be lowest when hosts have moderate lifespans and an intermediate probability of reaching the adult stage. Our results elucidate how interactions between trade-offs and the epidemiological-demographic structure of the population can lead to the evolution of elevated juvenile susceptibility.
