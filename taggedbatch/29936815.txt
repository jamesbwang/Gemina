 Bioaerosols are particularly sensitive to sterilization processes due to their biological characteristics. Phenomena occurring in the atmosphere have major influence on airborne bacteria and fungi<pathogen> concentration levels. The presented study evaluates the sterilization properties of ambient air temperature and solar radiation on viable bioaerosols concentration levels in outdoor air in Gliwice , Poland. Assigned were the breakpoints indicating limited stimulation properties of the air temperature , which amounted 7.5 °C for bacterial aerosol and 16.5 °C for fungal aerosol. Also revealed was the influence of solar radiation properties on decreasing the bioaerosols concentration levels. Both bacterial and fungal viable aerosol were sensitive to this radiation , although the phenomenon was more effective for airborne bacteria.
