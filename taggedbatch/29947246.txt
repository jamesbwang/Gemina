 Gender inequality and gender norms are key social drivers of the HIV<pathogen> epidemic through their influences on sexual relationships , behavior , and risk taking. However , few empirical studies have measured the influence of gender norms on HIV<pathogen> sexual-risk behaviors and HIV<pathogen> testing among men in sub-Saharan Africa. We analyzed cross-sectional , survey data from 399 sexually active men ( ages 18-39) in Democratic Republic of the Congo to examine the relationship between the men 's support for inequitable gender norms and their HIV-risk behaviors. Logistic regression analyses revealed that moderate and strong levels of support for inequitable gender norms were significantly associated with never having been tested for HIV<pathogen> ( AOR = 2.92 , p < .05 and AOR = 3.41 , p < .01 , for moderate and strong support , respectively). Our findings indicate that changing the prevailing gender norms should be prioritized in HIV-prevention efforts that aim to increase counseling and testing for men.
