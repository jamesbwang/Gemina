 A strategy was developed to obtain from acetylenedicarboxylic acid either an acetylenedicarboxylate-based Zr ( IV)- metal-organic framework ( MOF) with fcu topology or a halo-functionalized-MOF-801 through in-situ ligand hydrohalogenation. The new materials feature exceptionally high hydrophilicity and CO2/H2 adsorption energetics. The acetylenedicarboxylate linker and its functionalizable triple-bond discloses its potential in the engineering of microporous materials with targeted properties.
