 Tumor necrosis<symptom> factor receptor-associated factor 6 ( TRAF6) is an essential component of the signaling complex that mediates osteoclastogenesis. As an adaptor protein of E3 ligase function , TRAF6 regulates NF-κB signaling via TAK1 and I-κB kinase ( IKK) activation. Here , we investigated novel mechanisms by which TRAF6 signaling is regulated under receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand ( RANKL)- induced osteoclastogenesis. A yeast two-hybrid screen system identified cellular factors that interact with TRAF6. The interactions were confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays , followed by immuno-blotting. The role of TRAF6 in bone growth and remodeling was determined by osteoclast differentiation and bone-resorption pit assays. Regulatory mechanisms were examined by co-immunoprecipitation , immuno-blotting , real-time polymerase chain reaction , and luciferase reporter assays. We show that B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia<disease> protein 3 ( BCL3) interacts with TRAF6 through its ankyrin-repeat domain and inhibits osteoclastogenesis in bone<disease> marrow derived macrophages ( BMDMs). Further , TRAF6 interacts with CYLD to mediate BCL3 deubiquitination , which facilitates the cytoplasmic accumulation of BCL3 and represses BCL3 and p50 complex-mediated cyclin D1 transcription. TRAF6 promotes RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by regulating novel non-canonical NF-κB signaling via BCL3 deubiquitination , indicating that BCL3 provides valuable insights into bone loss-associated diseases.
