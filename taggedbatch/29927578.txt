 Core-shell nanoparticles of Au@Pd with precise submonolayer , monolayer , or multilayer structure were synthesized using ligand-exchange reactions of palladate ions onto colloidal Au nanocrystals. Decoupling the palladate adsorption step from the subsequent reduction enables excellent precision , uniformity , and tunability in the Pd shell thickness. The redox properties of the surface Pd are directly correlated to the thickness of the Pd shell with a > +200 mV shift in the PdO reduction potential for submonolayer Au@Pd nanoparticles compared to pure Pd. Using these precisely controlled core-shell materials , the oxygen reduction catalytic activity can be directly correlated to PdO reduction potential and Pd surface coverage on Au. When the Pd oxide reduction peak is shifted by +240 mV compared to pure Pd , a 50 mV reduction in overpotential and a 4-fold increase in kinetic current density for oxygen reduction are observed. Colloidal ligand-exchange synthesis may be particularly useful for noble metal core-shell catalysts as a strategy to subtly tune the electronic properties of surface atoms in order to lower overpotential and increase catalytic turnover.
