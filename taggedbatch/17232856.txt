 To evaluate , by comparing maxillary sinus volumes , how asymmetries related to oculoauriculovertebral spectrum ( OAVS) affect upper-jaw development. From pre-existing multislice spiral computed tomography ( MSCT) datasets , we selected 20 cases of 11 female and 9 male patients aged 6.1-24 years who were clinically and radiographically symmetrical ( group 1) plus 20 cases of 8 female and 12 male patients aged 5.7-23.9 years who had OAVS ( group 2). After three-dimensional reconstruction of the datasets , the volumes of the left and right maxillary sinuses were calculated and compared based on patient groups and based on the sides affected or unaffected by OAVS. To this end , the OAVS patients were subdivided into a group in whom both external acoustic pores were radiographically present ( group 2a) and a group in whom the pore on the affected side was congenitally missing ( group 2b). Intrarater reliability was very high ( 0.997). Significantly larger volumes of the maxillary sinuses , amounting to a mean of 13.4 ml , were observed in the control group than in the asymmetric OAVS groups where the volumes averaged 9.8 ml or 10.3 ml , respectively ( p = 0.03). No statistically significant differences in sinus volumes were found between the two OAVS groups ( p = 0.557) and between the sides affected or unaffected by the OAVS ( p = 0.8311 in group 2a and 0.4961 in group 2b). Overall , we found the volumes of both maxillary sinuses to be somewhat smaller in the asymmetric patients than in the symmetric control group. This might indicate that OAVS was associated with a mild generalized hypoplasia of the maxilla , but significantly different sinus volumes were not seen between the affected and unaffected sides.
