 Video consultations ( VCs) provide increased accessibility of primary care to remote areas and overall improved care for chronic patients. They also contribute to higher patient satisfaction and improved resource management. Despite these benefits , VC integration into the health system is complex and slow. Understanding the VC-related preferences of three key stakeholders-patients , primary care physicians ( PCPs) and policy makers ( PMs)- is crucial for achieving optimal implementation. The aim of this study was to select relevant attributes and levels for a discrete choice experiment ( DCE) of stakeholders ' choice-VC or traditional in-clinic consultation ( I-CC) in primary care. Ten semi-structured focus group interviews and 24 semi-structured individual interviews were conducted. Data analysis was performed inductively , using a thematic content analysis method. An attribute-ranking exercise was then conducted based on the results gleaned from the interviews. The most important attributes when choosing either VC or I-CC , for both patients and PMs , were: ( 1) time to next available appointment; ( 2) time in line before consultation; ( 3) relationship to PCP; and ( 4) quality of consultation. For PCPs , the most important attributes were: ( 1) time in line before consultation; ( 2) patient 's self-management ability; ( 3) consultation purpose; ( 4) quality of consultation. This qualitative study identified attributes and levels for a DCE quantitative stage among three key stakeholder groups. It adds to the literature of examples of developing DCE attributes , and to literature about the stakeholder benefits in the area of telemedicine in healthcare.
