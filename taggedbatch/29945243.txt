 Plastidial isoprenoids , such as carotenoids and tocopherols , are relevant anti-oxidant metabolites synthesized in plastids from precursors generated by the methylerythritol 4-phosphate ( MEP) pathway. In this work , we found that irradiation of Arabidopsis thaliana plants with UV-B caused a strong increase in the accumulation of the photoprotective xanthophyll zeaxanthin but also slightly higher levels of γ-tocopherol. Plants deficient in MEP enzymes 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase and 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase showed a general reduction in both carotenoids and tocopherols associated with increased DNA damage and decreased photosynthesis after UV-B exposure. Genetic blockage of tocopherol biosynthesis did not affect DNA damage accumulation. In contrast , lut2 mutants accumulating β,β-xanthophylls showed decreased DNA damage when irradiated with UV-B. Analysis of aba2 mutants showed that UV-B protection is not mediated by ABA ( a hormone derived from β,β-xanthophylls). Plants accumulating β,β-xanthophylls also show decreased oxidative damage and increased expression of DNA repair enzymes , suggesting that this can be a mechanism for these plants to decrease DNA damage. In addition , in vitro experiments also provide evidence that β,β-xanthophylls can directly protect against DNA damage by absorbing radiation. Together , our results suggest that xanthophyll cycle carotenoids that protect against excess illumination could also contribute to the protection against UV-B.
