 The elderly population is increasing in Turkey and across the world. With the frequent use of imaging modalities , the detection rate of coincidental small renal mass has also increased. Since small renal masses are generally not malignant , most of them can be followed up by active surveillance. In the current study , we examined the treatment options that can be offered to elderly patients with small renal masses. The optimum treatment method for patients of advanced age presenting with renal masses should be determined based on the presence of comorbidities such as age , renal function , and tumor characteristics.
