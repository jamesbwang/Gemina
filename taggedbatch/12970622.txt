 Letters of recommendation ( LORs) are an important part of applications for residency and fellowship programs. Despite anecdotal use of a `` code '' in LORs , research on program director ( PD) perceptions of the value of these documents is sparse. We analyzed PD interpretations of LOR components and discriminated between perceived levels of applicant recommendations. We conducted a cross-sectional , descriptive study of pediatrics residency and fellowship PDs. We developed a survey asking PDs to rate 3 aspects of LORs: 13 letter features , 10 applicant abilities , and 11 commonly used phrases , using a 5-point Likert scale. The 11 phrases were grouped using principal component analysis. Mean scores of components were analyzed with repeated-measures analysis of variance. Median Likert score differences between groups were analyzed with Mann-Whitney Our survey had a 43 % response rate ( 468 of 1079). `` I give my highest recommendation '' was rated the most positive phrase , while `` showed improvement '' was rated the most negative. Principal component analysis generated 3 groups of phrases with moderate<symptom> to strong correlation with each other. The mean Likert score for each group from the PD rating was calculated. Positive phrases had a mean ( SD) of 4.4 ( 0.4) , neutral phrases 3.4 ( 0.5) , and negative phrases 2.6 ( 0.6). There was a significant difference among all 3 pairs of mean scores ( all Commonly used phrases in LORs were interpreted consistently by PDs and influenced their impressions of candidates. Key elements of LORs include distinct phrases depicting different degrees of endorsement.
