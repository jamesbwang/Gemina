 Gingipains are extracellular cysteine proteases of the oral pathogen Porphyromonas<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> and are its most potent virulence factors. They can degrade a great variety of host proteins , thereby helping the bacterium<pathogen> to evade the host immune response , deregulate signaling pathways , trigger anoikis and , finally , cause tissue destruction. Host cell-surface proteins targeted by gingipains are the main focus of this review and span three groups of substrates: immune-regulatory proteins , signaling pathways regulators and adhesion molecules. The analysis of published data revealed that gingipains predominantly inactivate their substrates by cleaving them at one or more sites , or through complete degradation. Sometimes , gingipains were even found to initially shed their membrane substrates , but this was mostly just the first step in the degradation of cell-surface proteins.
