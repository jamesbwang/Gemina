 There is growing awareness that psychosocial risk and resilience factors in early life play a key role in influencing later health. Most work has been done in high-income settings , rather than low-income and middle-income countries ( LMICs) , where the majority of the global childhood population resides. The few studies with well-defined cohorts in LMICs have employed various methods and measures , making comparisons across studies challenging. This presentation describes the methodology for infant and child developmental measures used in the Drakenstein Child Health Study ( DCHS) , a multidisciplinary longitudinal birth cohort study in South Africa. We outline a multilevel approach combining a range of measures including parental reports , behaviour observations , clinician-administered scales and brain imaging. Using this approach , we aim at a longitudinal perspective of developmental , cognitive , socioemotional and neurophysiological outcomes in a birth cohort of children in an LMIC. The study was approved by the faculty of Health Sciences , Human Research Ethics Committee , University of Cape Town ( 401/2009) , Stellenbosch University ( N12/02/0002) and the Western Cape Provincial Health Research committee ( 2011RP45). Children in the DCHS develop in a context typical of many communities in South Africa and other LMICs. There is a critical need for research in LMICs to elucidate underlying factors that inform risk for , and resilience to , poor developmental outcomes in infants born into high-risk communities. Such work may inform effective intervention strategies appropriate to this context.
