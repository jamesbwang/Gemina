 Tropical forests exhibit significant heterogeneity in plant functional and chemical traits that may contribute to spatial patterns of key soil biogeochemical processes , such as carbon storage and greenhouse gas emissions. Although tropical forests are the largest ecosystem source of nitrous oxide ( N
