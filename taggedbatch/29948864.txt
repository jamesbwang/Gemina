 We conducted a meta-analysis to explore the association between the use of different anti-ulcer agents and the risk of chronic kidney disease ( CKD) , end-stage renal disease ( ESRD) , and decline in glomerular filtration rate ( GFR) in various study populations. PubMed , Embase , and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant entries up to July 1 , 2017. The primary outcomes of the meta-analysis were risk ratios ( RRs) of CKD , ESRD , and decline in GFR. We also investigated the heterogeneity of the meta-analysis by subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis. A total of 662,624 individuals were enrolled in five trials. Compared with non-PPI users , PPI users had a higher trend of CKD ( RR = 1.16 , 95 % CI 1.07-1.25 , P < 0.001) , especially ESRD ( RR = 1.81 , 95 % CI 1.59-2.06 , P < 0.001). There was an elevated risk of adverse renal outcome among participants receiving PPI and not H2RA ( CKD: RR = 1.28 , 95 % CI 1.24-1.33 , P < 0.001; ESRD: RR = 1.39 , 95 % CI 1.17-1.64 , P < 0.001; GFR: RR = 1.31 , 95 % CI 1.26-1.36 , P < 0.001). However , H2RA users were not associated with CKD when compared with non-H2RA users ( RR = 1.02 , 95 % CI 0.83-1.25 , P = 0.855). In subgroup analysis , the average age of individuals and drug dosage had no influence on the risk of CKD , while duration of PPI exposure from 31 to 720 days is a potential factor in progression to ESRD ( P < 0.001). Chronic PPI use , but not H2RAs , is associated with deterioration in kidney function.
