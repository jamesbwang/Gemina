 Chronic hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection is the most common blood-borne infection in the USA. Estimating prevalence is critical for monitoring diagnosis , treatment , and cure and for allocating resources. Surveillance data reported to the New<pathogen> York City ( NYC -RRB- Health Department , 2000-2015 , were used to estimate HCV<pathogen> prevalence in NYC in 2015. The numbers who died , out-migrated or whose last RNA test was negative were removed from the count of people reported with HCV<pathogen>. A simulation model was used to remove estimates of people whose infection spontaneously cleared or was cured and to add an estimate of people unaware of infection. The surveillance-based HCV<pathogen> prevalence in NYC in 2015 overall was 1.4 % ( 95 % certainty level ( CL) 1.2-1.6 %; n ≈ 116 000 , 95 % CL ≈ 99 000-135 000) and among adults aged ⩾ 20 years was 1.8 % ( 95 % CL 1.5-2.0 % , n ≈ 115 000 , 95 % CL ≈ 99 000-134 000) , lower than the 2010 estimate among adults aged ⩾ 20 years of 2.4 % ( n ≈ 147 000). Contributors to the decrease in HCV<pathogen> prevalence from 2010 to 2015 include both the availability of highly effective treatment and also deaths among an ageing population. The 2015 estimate can be used to set NYC-specific HCV<pathogen> screening and treatment targets and monitor progress towards HCV<pathogen> elimination.
