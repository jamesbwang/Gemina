 In 2006 , a county-wide survey of general practitioners ( GPs) in the United Kingdom ( UK) identified a reluctance to refer younger men with abnormal prostate specific antigen ( PSA) levels. Younger men have the most to gain from early-detection of prostate cancer ( PCa) , which remains a national government priority in the UK and around the world. We sought to assess changes in perception of abnormal PSA-values amongst UK GPs over the past 10 years. A total of 500 self-administered paper questionnaires were distributed to individually named GPs. One hundred and forty two responded ( 28.4 %) , representing a patient population of âˆ¼ 600,000. A series of visual analogue questions assessed referral thresholds and understanding of risk factors related to the development of PCa. GPs with a median of 23-years experience responded. Although mean PSA threshold for referral to urology did fall between 2006 and 2016 in both the 45-year ( 5.42 ng/mL vs. 4.61 ng/mL Awareness of abnormal PSA values in UK primary care is improving , but continues to lag behind the evidence. Strategies to disseminate knowledge of maximum PSA-values to GPs should focus especially on those for younger patients.
