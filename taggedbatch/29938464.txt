 Background: Due to progress in medical care , the number of survivors from cancer has increased significantly during recent years and this raises the question of the quality of life ( QoL) , especially of the many women treated for a breast cancer. This paper focuses on correlations of QoL with anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> on the one hand and with socio demographic , anatomo-clinical and therapeutic parameters on the other. Methods: In this cross-sectional study , seventy patients were enrolled and filled in two auto-questionnaires , both in validated Arabic versions: The SF-36 for assessment of QoL and the Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale ( HAD-S) for evaluation of anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom>. The statistical approaches used to determine predictive factors were bivariate correlations to determine relationships between quantitative variables , and T-tests and one-way Anova to analyze links between qualitative and quantitative variables. Results: The QoL of patients was altered with an SF-36 mean total score of 54.0 ± 22.7 , and the alteration affects the different aspects. The mean scores for anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> in patients were 6.91 ± 4.72 and 6.24 ± 3.88 , respectively. The results of this study suggested an association between the QoL and chemotherapy ( p = 0.014) and its adverse effects ( p = 0.01) , as well as anxiety<symptom> ( p = 0.0001) and depressive symptoms ( p = 0.0001). Socio-demographic factors , the stage of the cancer , and surgery , radiotherapy or hormone therapy did not appear to have significant effects. Conclusion: The management of breast cancer patients needs a collaborative approach between oncologists , gynecologists , psychologist and psychiatrists.
