 Pelvic ring fractures , occurring in elderly patients are a challenging problem. Little known is about the patient-related outcome after these injuries. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the quality of life after pelvic ring injuries in patients aged over 60 years. Patients ( ≥ 60 years) with pelvic ring fractures treated in our trauma department between 2004 and 2014 were included. Next to patient data , injury-related details as well as treatment details were assessed. After a follow-up of at least two years , the survival rate and the patient-related outcome were evaluated using the SF-36 and the EQ-5D score. One hundred ninety-six patients ( 138 women; 58 men; mean age 75.3 ± 7.8 years) were identified. Ninety-six patients were treated operatively , 100 patients conservatively. The overall complication rate was significantly lower for conservatively compared to operatively treated patients ( conservatively 18 % vs. operatively 33 %; p = 0.014). The total mortality rate over 2 years is 29 % with no significant difference of the two-year survival rate ( 2-year survival rate: operatively 77 % vs. non-operatively 65 %; p = 0.126). Fifty-five patients completed the SF-36 and EQ-5D score after a mean follow-up of 4.2 ± 2.9 years. The mean physical component score of the SF-36 is 33.6 ± 8.3 , and the mean mental component score is 45.3 ± 8.4. The mean EQ-5D VAS reached 62.5 ± 27.9. Elderly patients with pelvic ring fractures show a high mortality rate and a limited patient-related outcome. While the complication rate of conservatively treated patients is lower compared to operated patients , the two year survival rate is steady.
