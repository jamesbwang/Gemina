 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPAR-γ) which controls body<symptom> weight , glucose homeostasis , and adipocyte differentiation is a valuable candidate gene for insulin resistance ( IR). The present study aimed to compare the effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ( DASH) diet and usual dietary advice ( UDA) on PPAR-γ gene expression in women at risk for cardiovascular disease ( CVD). This randomized controlled trial was performed on 44 women aged 20-50 years at risk for CVD ( BMI > 25 kg/m2 and low physical activity). Participants were randomly assigned to the UDA ( n = 22) or DASH ( n = 22) diets for 12 weeks. The DASH diet was rich in fruits , vegetables , whole grains and low-fat dairy products and low in saturated fat , total fat , cholesterol , refined grains and sweets , with a total of 2400 mg/day sodium. The UDA diet was a regular diet with healthy dietary advice. Anthropometric indices and PPAR-γ gene expression were measured and compared between the two groups at the end of the study. After the intervention , body mass index ( BMI) and waist circumference ( WC) significantly decreased in the DASH group ( P < 0.050) but the results showed no significant differences between the two groups. At the end of the trial , PPAR-γ gene expression was significantly different between the UDA and the DASH diet groups ( P = 0.040) and this difference remained significant after adjustment for BMI , and physical activity ( P = 0.030). The result of the study showed that the DASH diet significantly decreased the expression of PPAR-γ. This finding was unexpected and future studies on the current topic are therefore recommended.
