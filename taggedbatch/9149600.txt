 Pseudoaneurysm secondary to chronic pancreatitis<disease> is a rare complication , but one with a high mortality rate. It is etiologically associated with chronic pancreatitis<disease> , and most diagnoses are made after rupture , which manifests with clinical signs of acute<symptom> hemorrhage<symptom>. Computed tomography plays an important role in diagnosis , but digital subtraction angiography remains the gold-standard method for diagnostic confirmation and for treatment planning. This article describes two cases of pseudoaneurysm in patients with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis<disease>; one involving the splenic artery and the other the gastroduodenal artery , complicated by thoracic and abdominal<symptom> bleeding<symptom> respectively. Both were successfully treated , using minimally invasive endovascular methods to implant coils and stent-grafts.
