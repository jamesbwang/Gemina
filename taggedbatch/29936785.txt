 Background: One of the malignant tumors is Breast Cancer ( BC) that starts in the cells of breast. There is many models for survival analysis of patients such as Cox PH model , Parametric models etc.. But some disease are that all of patients will not experience main event then usual survival model is inappropriate. In addition , In the presence of cured patients , if researcher can specify distribution of survival time , usually cure rate models are preferable to parametric models. Distribution of Survival time can be Weibull , Log normal , Logistic , Gamma and so. Comparison of Weibull , Log normal and Logistic distribution for finding the best distribution of survival time is purpose of this study. Material and Methods: Among 787 patients with BC by Cancer Research Center recognized and followed from 1985 until 2013. Variables stage of cancer , age at diagnosis , tumor size and Number of Removed Positive Lymph Nodes ( NRPLN) for fitting Cure rate model were selected. The best model selected with DIC criteria. All analysis were performed using SAS 9.2. Results: Mean ( SD) of age was 48.47 ( 11.49) years and Mean of survival time and Maximum follow up time was 326 and 55.12 months respectively. During following patients , 145 ( 18.4 %) patients died from BC and others survived ( censored). Also , 1-year , 5-year and 10-year survival rate was 94 , 77 and 56 percent respectively. Log normal model with smaller DIC were selected and fitted. All of mentioned variables in the model were significant on cure rate. Conclusion: This study indicated that survival time of BC followed from Log normal distribution in the best way.
