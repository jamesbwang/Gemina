 For decades , it has been thought that glutamate and GABA are released by distinct neurons. However , some mouse neurons innervating the lateral habenula ( LHb) co-release glutamate and GABA. Here , we mapped the distribution of neurons throughout the rat brain that co-express vesicular transporters for the accumulation of glutamate ( VGluT2) or GABA ( VGaT) and for GABA synthesis ( GAD). We found concentrated groups of neurons that co-express VGluT2 , VGaT , and GAD mRNAs within subdivisions of the ventral tegmental area ( VTA) , entopeduncular ( EPN) , and supramammillary ( SUM) nuclei. Single axon terminals established by VTA , EPN , or SUM neurons form a common synaptic architecture involving asymmetric ( putative excitatory) and symmetric ( putative inhibitory) synapses. Within the LHb , which receives co-transmitted glutamate and GABA from VTA and EPN , VGluT2 and VGaT are distributed on separate synaptic vesicles. We conclude that single axon terminals from VGluT2 and VGaT co-expressing neurons co-transmit glutamate and GABA from distinct synaptic vesicles at independent synapses.
