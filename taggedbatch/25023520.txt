 In global health discussions , there have been widespread calls for health policy and programme implementation to be informed by the best available evidence. However , recommendations in the literature on knowledge translation are often decontextualised , with little attention to the local systems of institutions , structures and practices which can direct the production of evidence and shape whether or how it informs health decisions. This article explores these issues in the country setting of Cambodia , where the Ministry of Health has explicitly championed the language of evidence-based approaches to policy and planning. Research for this paper combined multiple sources and material , including in-depth interviews with key informants in Phnom Penh and the analysis of documentary material and publications. Data collection and analysis focused on two key domains in evidence advisory systems: domestic capacities to generate health policy-relevant evidence and institutional mechanisms to monitor , evaluate and incorporate evidence in the policy process. We identified a number of structural arrangements that may increasingly work to facilitate the supply of health-related data and information , and their use to inform policy and planning. However , other trends and features appear to be more problematic , including gaps between research and public health priorities in the country , the fragmented nature of research activities and information systems , the lack of a national policy to support and guide the production and use of evidence for health policy , and challenges to the use of evidence for intersectoral policy-making. In Cambodia , as in other low/middle-income countries , continued investments to increase the supply and quality of health data and information are needed , but greater attention should be paid to the enabling institutional environment to ensure relevance of health research products and effective knowledge management.
