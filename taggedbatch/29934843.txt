 Entrapment syndromes<disease><symptom> of peripheral nerves at the elbow are common and are often diagnostically challenging disorders. Difficulties consist in lesion<symptom> localization and recognition of complex spatial lesion<symptom> patterns as well as in differentiation of focal and multifocal disorders. Medical history taking , neurological examination and neurophysiological tests represent the gold standard in the diagnosis of peripheral nerve lesions<symptom> at the elbow , but have known methodical limitations. Additional diagnostic imaging tools recently developed for high-resolution visualization of extended peripheral nerve segments include 3 T magnetic resonance neurography ( MRN) and neurosonography. MRN and neurosonography can directly visualize and thus precisely localize focal and nonfocal peripheral nerve lesions<symptom> of various origins with high spatial resolution at the anatomical level of nerve fascicles. MRN can cover peripheral nerve structures at the elbow , evaluate spatial nerve lesion<symptom> patterns and partly disclose underlying causes. Imaging of peripheral nerves is a valuable addition in the diagnostic work-up of entrapment syndromes<disease><symptom> at the elbow and provides important assistance in the differentiation of nonfocal differential diagnoses , especially in cases that can not be clarified using standard diagnostic methods. The evaluation of spatial nerve lesion<symptom> pattern may give additional information on the origin of the underlying disease , which is essential for further treatment.
