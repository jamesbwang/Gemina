 The properties of DNA self-assembled monolayers ( SAMs) have strong influences on the interfacial DNA-analyte binding behavior , which further affect the performance of biosensors built upon. In this work , we prepared binary thiolate DNA/6-ferrocenyl -1-hexanethiol ( FcC6SH) SAMs on gold ( DNA/FcC6S-Au) for convenient electrochemical characterization and subsequent data analysis. Our cyclic voltammetric ( CV) studies confirmed that the redox responses of surface-tethered Fc and electrostatically bound ( Ru ( NH
