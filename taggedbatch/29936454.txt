 In order to search for substances that reduce the neurotoxicity of paclitaxel , the sensitivity of differentiated rat neuronal PC12 cells to paclitaxel was compared to that of malignant and non-malignant cells , and the extent to which four antioxidants can alleviate paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity was investigated. Viability of cells was determined by the MTT method. Cytotoxicity was evaluated as the concentration that reduced cell viability by 50 % ( CC Paclitaxel was three-fold more cytotoxic towards human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines ( Ca9-22 , HSC-2 , HSC-3. HSC-4) than human normal epithelial and mesenchymal ( human gingival fibroblast , human periodontal ligament fibroblast , human pulp cell) normal cells , confirming its antitumor potential. However , paclitaxel at as low a concentration as 5 ng/ml significantly reduced neurite formation in nerve growth factor-induced differentiated PC12 cells , although complete killing of cells was not achieved even at 2,000-fold higher concentration ( 10 Î¼M). Paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity was enhanced with the prolongation of incubation time and reduction of inoculation cell density. Four antioxidants , namely docosahexaenoic acid , acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride , N-acetyl-L-cysteine and sodium ascorbate , only partially protected PC12 cells from paclitaxel-induced toxicity. The present study suggests the involvement of both oxidative and other mechanisms in paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity.
