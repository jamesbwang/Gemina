 There is a paucity of Australian data on the use of Mohs micrographic surgery for treating melanoma in situ and lentigo maligna. We share an Australian centre 's experience with the technique. A total of 62 patients with 62 lesions<symptom> of melanoma in situ and lentigo maligna referred for treatment between 2015 and 2017 comprised the study group. All melanomas were excised with Mohs micrographic surgery utilising melanoma-associated antigen recognised by T-cells ( MART-1) immunostaining. Follow up ranged from 3 to 30 months with no reported recurrences or melanoma-related deaths. 94 % ( 58/62) of lesions<symptom> were primary melanomas and 6 % were locally recurrent. 89 % of lesions<symptom> involved head and neck sites with 11 % involving trunk or limbs. In total 55 % ( 12/62) of lesions<symptom> were cleared with 3-mm clinical margins , 68 % with 6 mm , 92 % with 9 mm and 100 % with 12-mm. The mean clinical excision margin was 6.7 mm. All lesions<symptom> with a tumour diameter greater than 2.2 cm required a 9-mm clinical margin or greater for excision. The mean clinical excision margin for recurrent tumours was 9 mm. We provide the first Australian data on the use of Mohs micrographic surgery for melanoma.
