 Because the hand joints possess a broad range of motion , the muscle length can vary importantly which might result in significant variations of the muscle force-generating capacities. However , facing the complexity of this musculoskeletal system , no study has examined the effect of hand muscles length change on muscle force. This study aimed to characterize the force-length relationship of muscles involved in wrist and metacarpophalangeal ( MCP) flexion. Eleven participants performed two sessions: i) one for the wrist flexor muscles , and ii) one for the finger flexor muscles. For each session , the participants performed two maximal voluntary contractions ( MVC) and then two progressive isometric ramps from 0 to 100 % of their maximal force capacity at five different wrist/MCP angles. Torque , kinematic and electromyographic data were recorded. An ultrasound scanner was used to measure the myotendinous junction displacement of flexor carpi radialis ( FCR) and flexor digitorum superficialis ( FDS) during isometric contractions. A 3D relationship between muscle length , force and activation level was modeled using optimization procedure. Globally , the FCR was stronger and shorter compared to FDS. The results showed that the 3D relationships fitted well the experimental data ( mean R2 = 0.92 ± 0.07 and 0.87 ± 0.11 for FCR and FDS , respectively). Using joint angle and EMG data , this approach allows to estimate the muscle force with low estimation errors ( < 9 % of Fmax). This study proposes a new method to investigate the force-length relationship by combining ultrasound measurement , musculoskeletal modeling and optimization procedures. The data and relationships provide a new insight into hand biomechanics and muscle function that could be useful for designing hand tools or surgical operations.
