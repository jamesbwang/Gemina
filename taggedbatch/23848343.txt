 Clinicians are increasingly sharing outpatient visit notes with patients through electronic portals. These open notes may bring about new educational opportunities as well as concerns to physicians-in-training and residency programs. We assessed anticipatory attitudes about open notes and explored factors influencing residents ' propensity toward note transparency. Residents in primary care clinics at 4 teaching hospitals were surveyed prior to implementation of open notes. Main measures included resident attitudes toward open notes and the anticipated effect on patients , resident workload , and education. Data were stratified by site. A total of 176 of 418 ( 42 %) residents responded. Most residents indicated open notes would improve patient engagement , trust , and education but worried about overwhelming patients , residents being less candid , and workload. More than half of residents thought open notes were a good idea , and 32 % ( 56 of 176) indicated they would encourage patients to read these notes. More than half wanted note-writing education and more feedback , and 72 % ( 126 of 175) indicated patient feedback on residents ' notes could improve communication skills. Attitudes about effects of open notes on safety , quality , trust , and medical education varied by site. Residents reported mixed feelings about the anticipated effects of sharing clinical notes with patients. They advocate for patient feedback on notes , yet worry about workload , supervision , and errors. Training site was correlated with many attitudes , suggesting local culture drives resident support for open notes. Strategies that address resident concerns and promote teaching and feedback related to notes may be helpful.
