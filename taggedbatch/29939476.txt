 Graphene functionalized nanotips are expected to possess promising potential for various applications based on the outstanding electrical and mechanical properties of graphene. However , current methods , usually requiring a high growth temperature and identical crystal surface to match graphene lattice , are suitable for graphene formation on a flat surface. It remains a big challenge to grow graphene on a nanosized convex surface and fabricate functionalized nanotips with high quality graphene at the apex. In this work , a novel ultrafast annealing method is developed for growing large area graphene on Ni nanotips within 1-2 s. Few layered or multiple layered graphene is presented on the apex or sidewall of the conical tip surface. Direct experimental evidences support that thus-produced graphene is formed via the direct conversion of nickel carbide at the outer surface under the instantaneous high temperature , which is different from the conventional segregation mechanism. This newly developed ultrafast method provides a new route to produce graphene efficiently and economically , promising for both convex surfaces and flat substrates. Moreover , the graphene functionalized nanotips exhibit a great potential for nanoelectrical measurements and conductive scanning probe microscopy ( SPM) applications.
