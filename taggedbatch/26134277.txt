 Acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) harbors an immune suppression environment , featured by increased regulatory T cells ( Tregs). The expression of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor receptor-2 ( TNFR2) on Tregs could be used to identify the maximally suppressive Treg population , and TNF-Î± furtherly promoted the expansion and function of Tregs
