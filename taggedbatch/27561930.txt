 Protein homeostasis is critically important for cell viability. Key to this process is the refolding of misfolded or aggregated proteins by molecular chaperones or , alternatively , their degradation by proteases. In most prokaryotes and in chloroplasts and mitochondria , protein degradation is performed by the caseinolytic protease ClpP , a tetradecamer barrel-like proteolytic complex. Dysregulating ClpP function has shown promise in fighting antibiotic resistance and as a potential therapy for acute myeloid leukemia<disease>. Here we use methyl-transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy ( TROSY)- based NMR , cryo-EM , biochemical assays , and molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the structural dynamics of ClpP from
