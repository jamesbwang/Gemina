 Serotonin ( 5HT) is a modulator of many vital processes in the spinal<disease> cord ( SC) , such as production of locomotion. In the larval zebrafish , intraspinal serotonergic neurons ( ISNs) are a source of spinal 5HT that , despite the availability of numerous genetic and optical tools , has not yet been directly shown to affect the spinal locomotor network. In order to better understand the functions of ISNs , we used a combination of strategies to investigate ISN development , morphology , and function. ISNs were optically isolated from one another by photoconverting Kaede fluorescent protein in individual cells , permitting morphometric analysis as they developed in vivo. ISN neurite lengths and projection distances exhibited the greatest amount of change between 3 and 4 days post-fertilization ( dpf) and appeared to stabilize by 5 dpf. Overall ISN innervation patterns were similar between cells and between SC regions. ISNs possessed rostrally-extending neurites resembling dendrites and a caudally-extending neurite resembling an axon , which terminated with an enlarged growth cone-like structure. Interestingly , these enlargements remained even after neurite extension had ceased. Functionally , application of exogenous 5HT reduced spinally-produced motor<symptom> nerve bursting. A selective 5HT reuptake inhibitor and ISN activation with channelrhodopsin-2 each produced similar effects to 5HT , indicating that spinally-intrinsic 5HT originating from the ISNs has an inhibitory effect on the spinal locomotor network. Taken together this suggests that the ISNs are morphologically mature by 5 dpf and supports their involvement in modulating the activity of the spinal locomotor network.
