 The stiffness of a hydrogel has a significant role on the mechanical stability of a scaffold. However , the stiffness of pure hydrogels can be tuned only within a limited range. Herein , it is hypothesized that the range of hydrogel stiffness can be greatly increased by the addition of calcium phosphate particles and that such composites promote the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs). Beta-tricalcium phosphate ( Î²-TCP) particles are incorporated at concentrations of 0.5 and 5 mg mL
