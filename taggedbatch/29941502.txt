 Endotoxemia has been recognized to be closely accompanied with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) and is responsible for many diabetic complications. Recent study suggests the potential role of butyrate , a short chain fatty acids ( SCFAs) from microbiota metabolite , on T2DM. Gut-leak is a key event in diabetic-endotoxemia. To investigate if butyrate could ameliorate diabetic-endotoxemia , both in vivo and in vitro experiments were carried out in the present study. The effect of butyrate supplementation on blood HbA1c and inflammatory cytokines were determined in db/db mice; gut barrier integrity and expression of tight junction proteins were investigated both in vivo and in vitro. Oral butyrate administration significantly decreased blood HbA1c , inflammatory cytokines and LPS in db/db mice; inflammatory cell infiltration was reduced , and gut integrity and intercellular adhesion molecules were increased as detected by HE staining , Immunohistochemistry and Western Blot. By gut microbiota assay , ratio of Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes for gut microbiota was reduced by butyrate. In Caco-2 cells , butyrate significantly promoted cell proliferation , decreased inflammatory cytokines ' secretion , enhanced cell anti-oxidative stress ability , and preserved the epithelial monocellular integrity which was damaged by LPS. The present findings demonstrated that butyrate supplementation could ameliorate diabetic-endotoxemia in db/db mice via restoring composition of gut microbiota and preserving gut epithelial barrier integrity.
