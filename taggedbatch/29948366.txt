 Land plants perceive gravity and respond to it in an organ-specific way; shoots typically direct growth upwards , roots typically downwards. Historically , at least with respect to maize plants , this phenomenon is attributed to three sequential processes , namely graviperception , the transduction of the perceived signal , and the graviresponse , resulting in a typical ( re) positioning of the organ or entire plant body relative to the gravivector. For decades , sedimentation of starch-containing plastids within the cells of special tissues has been regarded as the primary and initiating process fundamental for gravitropic growth ( starch-statolith hypothesis). Based on Popper 's falsification principle , uncompromising experiments were executed. The results indicate that the model of graviperception based on amyloplast sedimentation does not apply to maize seedlings.
