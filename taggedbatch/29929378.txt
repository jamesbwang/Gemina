 Background The exact mechanisms underlying the onset of a migraine attack are not completely understood. It is , however , now well accepted that the onset of the excruciating throbbing headache<symptom> of migraine is mediated by the activation and increased mechanosensitivity ( i.e. sensitization) of trigeminal nociceptive afferents that innervate the cranial meninges and their related large blood vessels. Objectives To provide a critical summary of current understanding of the role that the cranial meninges , their associated vasculature , and immune cells play in meningeal nociception and the ensuing migraine headache<symptom>. Methods We discuss the anatomy of the cranial meninges , their associated vasculature , innervation and immune cell population. We then debate the meningeal neurogenic inflammation<symptom> hypothesis of migraine and its putative contribution to migraine pain. Finally , we provide insights into potential sources of meningeal inflammation<symptom> and nociception beyond neurogenic inflammation<symptom> , and their potential contribution to migraine headache<symptom>.
