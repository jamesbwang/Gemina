 In anthropology , interest in how values are created , maintained and changed has been reinvigorated. In this case study , we draw on this literature to interrogate concerns about the relationship between data collection and the delivery of patient care within global health. We followed a pilot study conducted in Kayunga , Uganda that aimed to improve the collection of health systems data in five public health centres. We undertook ethnographic research from July 2015 to September 2016 in health centres , at project workshops , meetings and training sessions. This included three months of observations by three fieldworkers; in-depth interviews with health workers ( n = 15) and stakeholders ( n = 5); and six focus group discussions with health workers. We observed that measurement , calculation and narrative practices could be assigned care-value or data-value and that the attempt to improve data collection within health facilities transferred ` data-value ' into health centres with little consideration among project staff for its impact on care. We document acts of acquiescence and resistance to data-value by health workers. We also describe the rare moments when senior health workers reconciled these two forms of value , and care-value and data-value were enacted simultaneously. In contrast to many anthropological accounts , our analysis suggests that data-value and care-value are not necessarily conflicting. Actors seeking to make changes in health systems must , however , take into account local forms of value and devise health systems interventions that reinforce and enrich existing ethically driven practice.
