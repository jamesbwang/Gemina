 The identity of individual neuronal cell types is defined and maintained by the expression of specific combinations of transcriptional regulators that control cell type-specific genetic programs. The epithelium of the vomeronasal organ of mice contains two major types of vomeronasal sensory neurons ( VSNs): 1) the apical VSNs which express vomeronasal 1 receptors ( V1r) and the G-protein subunit Gαi2 and; 2) the basal VSNs which express vomeronasal 2 receptors ( V2r) and the G-protein subunit Gαo. Both cell types originate from a common pool of progenitors and eventually acquire apical or basal identity through largely unknown mechanisms. The transcription factor AP-2ε , encoded by the Tfap2e gene , plays a role in controlling the development of GABAergic interneurons in the main and accessory olfactory bulb ( AOB) , moreover AP-2ε has been previously described to be expressed in the basal VSNs. Here we show that AP-2ε is expressed in post-mitotic VSNs after they commit to the basal differentiation program. Loss of AP-2ε function resulted in reduced number of basal VSNs and in an increased number of neurons expressing markers of the apical lineage. Our work suggests that AP-2ε , which is expressed in late phases of differentiation , is not needed to initiate the apical-basal differentiation dichotomy but for maintaining the basal VSNs ' identity. In AP-2ε mutants we observed a large number of cells that entered the basal program can express apical genes , our data suggest that differentiated VSNs of mice retain a notable level of plasticity.
