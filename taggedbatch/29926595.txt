 To explore the effect of puerarin induced apoptosis in human non-small cell lung canner A549 cells and its possible mechanisms. A549 cells were cultivated in vitro. When 80 % ~ 90 % confluence was reached , they were treated with puerarin in different concentration ( 60 、 120 、 240 μg/ml). The effects on cell apoptpsis were examined by CCK-8 colorimetry. Characteristic morphological changes of apoptosis were observed by AO/EB staining. The apoptosis of A549 cells were detected by flow cytometry analysis. The proteins level of Apelin and APJ were tested by Western blot. CCK-8 test showed that puerarin could inhibit the proliferation of A549 cells in a time and concentration dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that puerarin could make A549 cells apoptosis. Compared with the A549 cells group , the protein expression of Apelin/APJ was decreased in puerarin groups. Puerarin induces apoptosis in A549 cells , and its mechanism may through the regulation of Apelin/APJ expression.
