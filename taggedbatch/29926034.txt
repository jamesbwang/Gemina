 We report a very fast ( 10-30 s) microwave method to prepare oleylamine-capped , monodisperse ca. 8-11 nm gold nanoparticles in an ionic liquid. A pyrrolidinium-based ionic liquid proved an excellent medium for the task whereas , despite their popularity in nanosynthesis , imidazolium ionic liquids gave no colloidally-stable gold nanoparticles in an otherwise identical reaction.
