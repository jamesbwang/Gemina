 In ophthalmology , there have been few reports of botulinum<pathogen> toxin type-A ( BTX-A) injection into the lacrimal gland to treat epiphora. In ENT , adductor and abductor ( ABSD) spasmodic dysphonia<symptom> are often treated with BTX-A injections into the respective overacting vocal cord muscles. We describe a 53-year old male with Parkinson 's disease who did not respond to BTX-A injections to either the lacrimal gland , for epiphora secondary to Parkinsonian-related blink lagophthalmos , or posterior cricoarytenoid ( PCA) muscles for ABSD. Subsequent BTX type-B ( BTX-B) injections into the lacrimal gland remarkably improved his epiphora. BTX-B injections into the PCA muscle also greatly improved his dysphonia<symptom>. We describe the first reported case of ( 1) BTX-B injection into the lacrimal gland for epiphora , ( 2) use of Botox in treating epiphora due to blink lagophthalmos/reduced blink frequency secondary to Parkinson 's disease , ( 3) BTX-B use in treating ABSD , and ( 4) association between ABSD and Parkinson 's disease.
