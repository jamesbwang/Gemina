 A pancreaticoduodenal artery ( PDA) aneurysm<disease> develops due to increased flow through the pancreaticoduodenal arcade in the setting of celiac or superior mesenteric artery occlusion. Additionally , there is no evidence on the computed tomography scan or angiography images that the dissection process extends to the PDA arcade. Moreover , the optimal treatment protocols for PDA aneurysms<disease> with celiac artery obstruction and for celiac artery dissection are controversial. We report 2 cases of ruptured PDA aneurysms<disease> caused by celiac artery obstruction due to celiac artery dissection in which the aneurysm<disease> was excluded , but celiac artery revascularization was not performed successfully. Our cases indicate that endovascular management for ruptured PDA aneurysms<disease> and conservative management for celiac artery obstruction due to celiac artery dissection are feasible as first-line treatment in such cases.
