 The presence of non-B HIV<pathogen> subtypes in the US has been documented during the epidemic , although the timing of early introductions of different subtypes remains uncertain. Subtype C , the most common HIV<pathogen> variant worldwide , was first reported in the US in 1996-97 , after subtype C had expanded greatly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Here we report a patient with subtype C infection acquired by mother-to-child transmission , born in the US in 1990 to a Washington D.C. resident who never traveled outside the US , demonstrating that subtype C was present in the US much earlier. Comparative analysis of the sequence from this patient and subtype C sequences in the US and elsewhere suggest multiple independent introductions of this subtype into the US have taken place , many of which are traced to sub-Saharan or East Africa. These data indicate subtype C HIV<pathogen> was already present in the US years earlier than previously reported , and during the early period of subtype C expansion..
