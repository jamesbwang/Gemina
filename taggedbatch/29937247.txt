 Technology interventions are showing promise to assist persons with dementia and their carers. However , low adoption rates for these technologies and ethical considerations have impeded the realization of their full potential. Building on recent evidence and an iterative framework development process , we propose the concept of `` ethical adoption '': the deep integration of ethical principles into the design , development , deployment , and usage of technology. Ethical adoption is founded on five pillars , supported by empirical evidence: ( 1) inclusive participatory design; ( 2) emotional alignment; ( 3) adoption modelling; ( 4) ethical standards assessment; and ( 5) education and training. To close the gap between adoption research , ethics and practice , we propose a set of 18 practical recommendations based on these ethical adoption pillars. Through the implementation of these recommendations , researchers and technology developers alike will benefit from evidence-informed guidance to ensure their solution is adopted in a way that maximizes the benefits to people with dementia and their carers while minimizing possible harm.
