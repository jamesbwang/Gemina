 Artisanal fisheries support millions of livelihoods worldwide , yet ineffective enforcement can allow for continued environmental degradation due to overexploitation. Here , we use spatial planning to design an enforcement strategy for a pre-existing spatial closure for artisanal fisheries considering climate variability , existing seasonal fishing closures , representative conservation targets and enforcement costs. We calculated enforcement cost in three ways , based on different assumptions about who could be responsible for monitoring the fishery. We applied this approach in the Patos Lagoon estuary ( Brazil) , where we found three important results. First , spatial priorities for enforcement were similar under different climate scenarios. Second , we found that the cost and percentage of area enforced varied among scenarios tested by the conservation planning analysis , with only a modest increase in budget needed to incorporate climate variability. Third , we found that spatial priorities for enforcement depend on whether enforcement is carried out by a central authority or by the community itself. Here , we demonstrated a method that can be used to efficiently design enforcement plans , resulting in the conservation of biodiversity and estuarine resources. Also , cost of enforcement can be potentially reduced when fishers are empowered to enforce management within their fishing grounds.
