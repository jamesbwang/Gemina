 The present study was undertaken to examine the effects of cytoplasmic volume on nucleus reprogramming and developmental competence of buffalo handmade cloning ( HMC) embryos. We found that both HMC embryos derived from ~ 150 % cytoplasm or ~ 225 % cytoplasm resulted in a higher blastocyst rate and total cell number of blastocyst in comparison with those from ~ 75 % cytoplasm ( 25.4 ± 2.0 % , 27.9 ± 1.6 % vs. 17.9 ± 3.1 %; 150 ± 10 , 169 ± 12 vs. 85 ± 6 , P < 0.05). Meanwhile , the proportions of nuclear envelope breakdown ( NEBD) and premature chromosome condensation ( PCC) were also increased in the embryos derived from ~ 150 % or ~ 225 % enucleated cytoplasm compared to those from ~ 75 % cytoplasm. Moreover , HMC embryos derived from ~ 225 % cytoplasm showed a decrease of global DNA methylation from the 2-cell to the 4-cell stage in comparison with those of ~ 75 % cytoplasm ( P < 0.05). Furthermore , the expression of embryonic genome activation ( EGA) relative genes ( eIF1A and U2AF) in HMC embryos derived from ~ 225 % cytoplasm at the 8-cell stages was also found to be enhanced compared with that of the ~ 75 % cytoplasm. Two of seven recipients were confirmed to be pregnant following transfer of blastocysts derived from ~ 225 % cytoplasm , and one healthy cloned calf was delivered at the end of the gestation period , whereas no recipients were pregnant after the transfer of blastocysts derived from ~ 75 % cytoplasm. These results indicate that the cytoplasmic volume of recipient oocytes affects donor nucleus reprogramming , and then further accounted for the developmental ability of the reconstructed embryos.
