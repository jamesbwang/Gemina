 DIEP flap has become the gold standard method for patients undergoing autologous breast reconstruction; however , previous surgery or scars in the abdominal area have been considered a relative contraindication for the use of abdominal tissue. Longitudinal midline abdominal scars may be specially problematic because of the poor midline crossover of blood and the high risk of necrosis<symptom> of the distal flap. Patients with small breast may be easily reconstructed with hemi-DIEP flap; however , patients with large breast need more tissue available. Our aim is to report a modification of a ` fleur-de-lis pattern ' for a breast reconstruction in a patient with previous abdominal surgery and large breast. The post-operative course was uneventful , flap did not show blood supply compromise , volume and symmetry are preserved after 6 months post-operative and donor site morbidity has not been observed. This modification may be very useful to avoid complications related to poor blood supply associated with scar tissues. Careful pre-operative planning and the transfer of only well-vascularised tissue are essential for a successful reconstruction.
