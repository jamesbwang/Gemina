 To evaluate the impacts of fluconazole minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC) according to primary antifungal agents on Candida<pathogen> glabrata<pathogen> bloodstream infection ( BSI) , a multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted in Korea , concerning the time period from January 2010 to February 2016. A total of 197 adult patients with C.<pathogen> glabrata<pathogen> BSI were included in the study , and neutropenia ( P = 0.026) , APACHE II score ( P = 0.004) , and fluconazole resistance ( HR 3.960 , 95 % CI 1.395-11.246 , P = 0.010) were associated with 30-day mortality in multivariate analysis. In subgroup analysis , fluconazole MIC = 32 μg/mL in the azole-treated group ( HR 6.691 , 95 % CI 1.569-28.542 , P = 0.010) and fluconazole MIC ≥ 64 μg/mL in the non-azole-treated group ( HR 3.337 , 95 % CI 1.183-9.411 , P = 0.023) showed the highest hazard ratio ( HR) for 30-day mortality. Increased fluconazole MIC was associated with poor outcome both in azole- and non-azole-treated patients with C.<pathogen> glabrata<pathogen> BSI.
