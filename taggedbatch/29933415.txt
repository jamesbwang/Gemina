 To describe the scientific evidence published in literature regarding the risk factors for the development of phlebitis. Integrative literature review with the inclusion of 14 original articles found in the LILACS , Scielo and Pubmed bases from January 2004 to April 2015 , analyzed by levels of evidence and frequency , associated factors , degree and treatment of phlebitis. The frequency/ incidence/ minimum rate of phlebitis was 3 % and the maximum was 59.1 %. Most articles ( 57.14 %) reported an association of phlebitis with risk factors , including the dwell time , puncture site and/ or anatomical region , hospitalization period , number of accesses , reason for removal , sex , antibiotics , intermittent maintenance and emergency insertion. The need for standardizing the quantification of this event and a weak connection between the risk factors associated with phlebitis were identified. Further studies need to be developed in order to grant a real understanding of this disease in the daily routines of a hospital.
