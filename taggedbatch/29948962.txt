 Qualitative methods such as semi-structured interviews and focus-groups are used to evaluate the applicability and relevance of device technologies in clinical practice , but when used alone , often lack generalizability. This study aimed to assess the face validity and feasibility of using a composite , three-step qualitative method ( the Parker Model) , to inform the development and implementation of ava The Parker Model combines concept mapping ( CM) , participatory design ( PD) , and stakeholder evaluation ( SE). CM , a structured group process , was used to identify patients ' opinions and concerns regarding the e-Device. Patients used this information in iterative PD sessions to create personal e-Device prototypes in cooperation with a designer and a healthcare professional. SE was performed based on semi-structured group and individual interviews with patients and disease-management stakeholders. The study recruited 14 patients , two doctors , two nurses , one medical secretary , and four other public servants. Three CM workshops revealed four key considerations: technical usability , physical design , concerns , and enthusiasm. Four personalized prototypes were developed during PD sessions. SE confirmed that the identified considerations were pivotal for the implementation and adaptation of the e-Device. This study is the first to apply a composite , qualitative research model when introducing an e-Device for the treatment and management of rheumatic disease. Results show that input from patients and other stakeholders using the Parker Model can add value to the development and implementation of an e-Device.
