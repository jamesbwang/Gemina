 A lack of correct awareness about immunization among parents put them at risk of falling prey to the anti-vaccine movement. This risk is present even in countries with a high vaccine uptake. This study was done with the objective of assessing the awareness of parents childhood vaccination. In this study conducted among 141 parents accompanying children to a routine clinic we found that 53.2 % of the participants had average or above average knowledge. Level of knowledge was associated with the level of education ( OR: 2.7 , 95 % CI 1.4-5.4) and the sex of the parent ( OR: 3.4 , 95 % CI 1.2-9.3). While our sample size is small , we recommend educational programmes for parents to strengthen their knowledge on vaccination to safeguard the continuity of a successful control of vaccine preventable diseases.
