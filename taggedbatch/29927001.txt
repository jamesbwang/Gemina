 Protein arginine N-methyltransferase 6 ( PRMT6) was deemed to be indispensable in the variety of biological processes. Upregulated PRMT6 was found in various<disease> human<disease> diseases<disease> including cancer. Herein , we investigated the performance of PRMT6 methylation in the diagnosis for CRC. A quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction ( qMSP) method was used to measure PRMT6 promoter methylation. The percentage of methylated reference ( PMR) was applied to represent gene methylation level. Our data indicated that PRMT6 promoter methylation levels were significantly lower in CRC tissues than those in paired nontumor tissues ( median PMR: 36.93 % vs 63.12 % , P = 1E-6) and normal intestinal tissues ( median PMR: 36.93 % vs 506.55 % , P = 8E-12). We further examined the potential role of PRMT6 hypomethylation by the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve. Our results showed that the area under the curve ( AUC) was 0.644 ( 95 % CI = 0.596-0.733) between CRC tissues and paired nontumor tissues , 0.958 ( 95 % CI = 0.919-0.998) between CRC tissues and normal intestinal tissues , and 0.899 ( 95 % CI = 0.825-0.972) between paired nontumor tissues and normal intestinal tissues. Our study firstly indicated that the hypomethylation of PRMT6 promoter could be a novel diagnostic biomarker for CRC.
