 Disinfection is an integral component of water treatment performed daily on large volumes of water worldwide. Chemical disinfection may result in the unintended production of disinfectant by-products ( DBPs) due to reactions between disinfectants and natural organic matter present in the source water. Due to their potential toxicity , levels of DBPs have been strictly regulated in drinking waters for many years. With water reuse now becoming more common around the world DBPs are increasingly becoming a concern in recycled waters , where a much larger amount and variety of compounds may be formed due to a higher abundance and diversity of organic material in the source waters. Regulation of DBPs in recycled waters is limited; generally , drinking water regulations are applied in place of specific guidelines for recycled waters. Such regulations are set for only 11 , commonly observed , compounds of the 600 + that may , potentially , be found. In this review an overview of current research in this area is provided , the types of compounds that have been observed , methods for their analysis and possible regulation are also discussed. Through this review it is evident that there is a knowledge gap for the occurrence of DBPs in recycled waters , especially when comparing this information to that available for drinking waters. The concentrations of DBPs observed in recycled waters are seen to be higher than those in drinking water , though still within potable threshold limits. It is clear that there is a need for the analysis and understanding of a larger suite of compounds in recycled waters , as these will most likely be the source of future , global renewable water.
