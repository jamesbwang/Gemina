 <b> <i> Background </i> </b>: Macro-thyroid-stimulating hormone ( macro-TSH) is a high-molecular-weight form of TSH that leads to hyperthyrotropinemia. This study was undertaken to examine the prevalence and nature of macro-TSH in females of reproductive age. <b> <i> Methods </i> </b>: Blood samples were taken from 1,794 female patients who visited the Hamada Obstetric and Gynecology Hospital in Tokyo , Japan complaining of infertility<symptom>. The serum of 305 patients with TSH concentrations > 2.5 mU/L was screened for macro-TSH by the polyethylene glycol ( PEG) method. Samples with TSH precipitation ratios by PEG > 70 % were further analyzed using gel filtration chromatography ( GFC) , protein G columns and 125I-TSH binding experiments. <b> <i> Results </i> </b>: Screening of the 305 patients revealed that 63 had serum TSH precipitation ratios > 70 %. GFC revealed that immunoreactive TSH , with a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa , eluted at higher ratios ( 79.6 ± 24.4 %) in 27 of the 63 patients , compared to 0.4 ± 2.0 % in the control group. Serum TSH concentrations in 24 of the 27 patients were spuriously elevated due to human anti-mouse antibodies. We found macro-TSH in the other three patients and one of them had detectable anti-TSH autoantibodies. Eight of the remaining 36 patients , who did not have high-molecular-weight TSH assessed by GFC , had immunoglobulin G-associated TSH. Three commercially available TSH immunoassays ( Elecsys ® , Centaur ® , and Architect ®) all recognized macro-TSH leading to the elevated serum TSH concentrations. <b> <i> Conclusions </i> </b>: Macro-TSH was present in 0.17 % of infertile women. Commercial TSH immunoassays recognized macro-TSH , resulting in the diagnosis of hyperthyrotropinemia.
