 A philosophical discussion of constructive realism and measurement in the development of nursing knowledge is presented. Through Carper 's four patterns of knowing , nurses come to know a person holistically. However , measurement as a source for nursing knowledge has been criticized for underlying positivism and reductionist approach to exploring reality. Which seems mal-alignment with person-centred care. Discussion paper. Constructive realism bridges positivism and constructivism , facilitating the measurement of physical and psychological phenomena. Reduction of complex phenomena and theoretical constructs into measurable properties is essential to building nursing 's empiric knowledge and facilitates ( rather than inhibits) person-knowing. Nurses should consider constructive realism as a philosophy to underpin their practice. This philosophy supports measurement as a primary method of inquiry in nursing research and clinical practice. Nurses can carefully select , and purposefully integrate , measurement tools with other methods of inquiry ( such as qualitative research methods) to demonstrate the usefulness of nursing interventions and highlight nursing as a science.
