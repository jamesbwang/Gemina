 To investigate the therapeutic effect of metronomic chemotherapy with low-dose Tegafur on patients with primary hepatic carcinoma ( PHC) after radiofrequency ablation ( RFA). PHC patients who underwent RFA were assigned to RFA + Tegafur group and RFA group , respectively. Patients in RFA + Tegafur group received metronomic chemotherapy with low-dose Tegafur after RFA. PHC patients in RFA group only received radiofrequency ablation. Therapeutic efficacy of the two groups was prospectively analyzed within 18 months after RFA. Disease control rate ( DCR) and progression-free survival ( PFS) in both groups were evaluated. Follow-up data showed that DCR in RFA + Tegafur group and RFA group at 9 months after RFA was 93.3 % and 73.4 % , respectively ( p = 0.038). Within the 18-month follow-up , median PFS in RFA + Tegafur group and RFA group was 16.25 months and 12.25 months , respectively ( p < 0.001). One-year PFS in RFA group was 53.3 % , which was remarkably lower than that of RFA + Tegafur group ( 83.3 % , p = 0.012). Moreover , the prevalence of major complications in the present study was 13.3 %. No treatment-related death occurred in both groups. Metronomic chemotherapy with low-dose Tegafur after RFA can slow down tumor progression and prolong the progression-free survival of PHC patients.
