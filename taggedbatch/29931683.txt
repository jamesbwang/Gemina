 To reducing the massive marine pollution and resource waste caused by octopus scraps , we developed the novel octopus scraps protein hydrolysate ( OSPH) with calcium-chelating activity , and further investigated the chelating interaction and calcium bioavailability of OSPH-Ca. The structural properties indicated that both amido and carboxy groups could be the reaction sites for chelation. The particle radius of OSPH increased by 32.25 nm after the calcium chelated with OSPH , indicating the intramolecular and intermolecular folding and aggregating. The enthalpy of OSPH increased by 0.8323 after chelation , showing the bands of OSPH-Ca needed more thermal energy to be destroyed than OSPH. Meanwhile , the chelate showed remarkable stability and absorbability under either acidic or basic conditions , which was in favor of calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans. Moreover , the calcium intake of OSPH-Ca increased by 41 % when compared with that of CaCl These findings revealed the feasibility to transform octopus scraps into a novel functional calcium chelate based on peptides , subsequently promoting environmental sustainability.
