 Dendrite pathology and synapse disassembly are critical features of chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In spite of this , the capacity of injured neurons to regenerate dendrites has been largely ignored. Here , we show that , upon axonal injury , retinal ganglion cells undergo rapid dendritic retraction and massive synapse loss that preceded neuronal death. Human recombinant insulin , administered as eye drops or systemically after dendritic arbour shrinkage and prior to cell loss , promoted robust regeneration of dendrites and successful reconnection with presynaptic targets. Insulin-mediated regeneration of excitatory postsynaptic sites on retinal ganglion cell dendritic processes increased neuronal survival and rescued light-triggered retinal responses. Further , we show that axotomy-induced dendrite retraction triggered substantial loss of the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR) activity exclusively in retinal ganglion cells , and that insulin fully reversed this response. Targeted loss-of-function experiments revealed that insulin-dependent activation of mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1) is required for new dendritic branching to restore arbour complexity , while complex 2 ( mTORC2) drives dendritic process extension thus re-establishing field area. Our findings demonstrate that neurons in the mammalian central nervous system have the intrinsic capacity to regenerate dendrites and synapses after injury , and provide a strong rationale for the use of insulin and/or its analogues as pro-regenerative therapeutics for intractable neurodegenerative diseases including glaucoma.
