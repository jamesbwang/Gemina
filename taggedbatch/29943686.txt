 Delivering therapeutics in a painless manner is one of the many objectives for the treatment of clinical conditions. Micro and nanoneedles are small-scale devices that can help overcome the resistance encountered during drug diffusion by creating conduits of small dimensions through biomembranes. Microneedles for drug delivery applications were manually produced until the 1990s and after this the high precision technology from the semiconductor industry was adopted for their production ( 1). Over the last decade or so , microneedles for transdermal applications have been widely studied. Currently , microneedle patches , mainly based on hyaluronates , are available over the counter for cosmetic applications. On the other hand , nanoneedles are used in atomic force microscopy , which has been explored for drug delivery and biosensing over the last two decades ( 2 , 3). Micro and nanoneedle-based biosensing also poses potential for environment-responsive drug delivery. In this article , the current research , clinical studies and future perspectives of micro and nanoneedle-based systems are discussed for drug delivery and biosensing applications.
