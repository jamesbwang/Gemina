 BACKGROUND- A variety of methods are used to define exposure in pharmacoepidemiologic studies. Although each method has known biases , the relative effect of these biases on an observed association has not been fully examined. OBJECTIVE- To explore the influence of different exposure definitions on estimates , using the association between metformin and all-cause mortality as a proto-typical model. METHODS- New users of oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs were identified using administrative health databases from Alberta , Canada between 1998 and 2010. Drug exposure was described using definitions that are commonly used in observational studies. All analyses included the same covariates of age , gender , and a comorbidity score , and subjects not exposed to metformin served as the reference group. The measure of association was assessed using a Cox Proportional Hazards model for cohort studies and conditional logistic regression for case-control studies. RESULTS- We identified 64,293 new oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs users; mean age 68.9 years , 33,131 ( 52 %) males , and 24,745 ( 39 %) deaths during a mean follow-up of 6 years. In adjusted models , the association between metformin and mortality ranged from 0.23 ( 95 % CI 0.22-0.25) to 0.92 ( 95 % CI 0.88-0.95) reduction. Most metformin exposure definitions , however , provided estimates in the 0.6-0.8 reduction range , aligning with the results of previous observational studies. CONCLUSIONS- The variety of exposure definitions tested in this analysis produced a wide range of associations between metformin and mortality risk. Therefore , pharmacoepidemiological studies should implement sensitivity analyses including at least two exposure definitions to provide more robust and potentially valid study estimates.
