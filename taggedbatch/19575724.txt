 This retrospective study evaluated the effect of using neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES) for the treatment of post-stroke urinary incontinence ( PSUI) among female population in China.A total of 163 eligible patients with PSUI were included in this study. Of these , 103 patients were assigned to a treatment group , and 60 subjects were assigned to a control group. All patients in both groups received bladder training. In addition , patients in the treatment group also received NMES. All patients were treated for a total of 8 weeks. The outcome measurements included the amount of urine leakage , urinary<symptom> symptoms<symptom> and quality of life. The urinary<symptom> symptoms<symptom> were measured by the Bristol Female Urinary<symptom> Symptoms<symptom> Questionnaire ( BFUSQ) score , and the quality of life was assessed by the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form ( ICIQ-SF) score. In addition , adverse events were also documented in this study.After 4-week treatment , patients who received NMES did not exert better outcomes in the amount of urine leakage , urinary<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , measured by BFUSQ scale , and the quality of life , assessed by ICIQ-SF scale. However , after 8-week treatment , patients in the treatment group showed greater effect in reducing the amount of urine leakage ( P < .01) , enhancing urinary<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , as measured by BFUSQ scale ( P < .01) , and improving the quality of life , as assessed by ICIQ-SF scale ( P < .01) , compared with patients in the control group. In addition , no adverse event was recorded during the period of 8-week treatment in this study.The results of this study indicated that NMES may benefit for patients with PSUI after 8-week treatment. Future studies should focus on warranting the results of this study.
