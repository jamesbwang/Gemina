 Malignant transformation is frequently associated with disease-specific epigenetic alterations , but the underlying mechanisms and pathophysiological consequences remain poorly understood. Here , we used global comparative DNA methylation profiling at CG-rich regions of 27 acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) samples to select a subset of aberrantly methylated CG-rich regions ( ~ 400 regions , ~ 15,000 CpGs) for quantitative DNA methylation profiling in a large cohort of AML patients ( n = 196) using MALDI-TOF analysis of bisulfite-treated DNA. Meta-analysis separated a subgroup of CG-rich regions showing highly correlated DNA methylation changes that were marked by histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. While the group of non-polycomb group ( PcG) target regions displayed methylation patterns that correlated well with molecular and cytogenetic markers , PcG target regions displayed a much weaker association with genetic features. However , the degree of methylation gain across the latter panel showed significant correlation with active DNMT3A levels and with overall survival. Our study suggests that both epigenetic as well as genetic aberrations underlay AML-related changes in DNA methylation at CG-rich regions and that the former may provide a marker to improve classification and prognostication of adult AML patients.
