 Several vaccine platforms have been successfully evaluated for prevention of Ebola<disease> virus ( EBOV<pathogen>) disease ( EVD) in nonhuman primates and humans. Despite remarkable efficacy by multiple vaccines , the immunological correlates of protection against EVD are incompletely understood. We systematically evaluated the antibody response to various EBOV<pathogen> proteins in 79 nonhuman primates vaccinated with various EBOV<pathogen> vaccine platforms. We evaluated the serum immunoglobulin ( Ig) G titers against EBOV<pathogen> glycoprotein ( GP) , the ability of the vaccine-induced antibodies to bind GP at acidic pH or to displace ZMapp , and virus neutralization titers. The correlation of these outcomes with survival from EVD was evaluated by appropriate statistical methods. Irrespective of the vaccine platform , protection from EVD strongly correlated with anti-GP IgG titers. The GP-directed antibody levels required for protection in animals vaccinated with virus-like particles ( VLPs) lacking nucleoprotein ( NP) was significantly higher than animals immunized with NP-containing VLPs or adenovirus-expressed GP , platforms that induce strong T-cell responses. Furthermore , protective immune responses correlated with anti-GP antibody binding strength at acidic pH , neutralization of GP-expressing pseudovirions , and the ability to displace ZMapp components from GP. These findings suggest key quantitative and qualitative attributes of antibody response to EVD vaccines as potential correlates of protection.
