 Inspired by the great success of fiber optics in ultrafast data transmission , photonic computing is being extensively studied as an alternative to replace or hybridize electronic computers , which are reaching speed and bandwidth limitations. Mimicking and implementing basic computing elements on photonic devices is a first and essential step toward all-optical computers. Here , an optical pulse-width modulation ( PWM) switching of phase-change materials on an integrated waveguide is developed , which allows practical implementation of photonic memories and logic devices. It is established that PWM with low peak power is very effective for recrystallization of phase-change materials , in terms of both energy efficiency and process control. Using this understanding , multilevel photonic memories with complete random accessibility are then implemented. Finally , programmable optical logic devices are demonstrated conceptually and experimentally , with logic `` OR '' and `` NAND '' achieved on just a single integrated photonic phase-change cell. This study provides a practical and elegant technique to optically program photonic phase-change devices for computing applications.
