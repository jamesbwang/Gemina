 Although the short-term advantages of laparoscopy for colon cancer ( CC) over open surgery have been clearly demonstrated , there is little evidence available concerning the long-term outcomes. This study aimed to compare the long-term results of laparoscopic surgery versus open surgery in a cohort of CC patients from a single center. A series of 443 patients consecutively operated on for stage I to III CC between January 2006 and December 2013 were followed up. Patients were divided into two groups according to the surgical technique and were compared for disease-free survival ( DFS) and overall survival ( OS) before and after 1:1 propensity score matching. Due to exclusions and drop-outs , the statistical analysis of the study is based on 398 patients. Open surgery was performed in 133 patients , and laparoscopic surgery was performed in 265. After propensity score matching , two comparable groups of 89 patients each were obtained. The 5-year DFS was 64.3 % and 78.2 % for patients in the open and laparoscopic resection groups , respectively ( hazard ratio ( HR) 0.63 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.33-1.19; P = 0.148). A 5-year OS of 72.1 % and 86.8 % was observed in the open and laparoscopic resection groups , respectively ( HR 0.43 , 95 % CI 0.20-0.94; P = 0.026). The multivariate survival analysis demonstrated better results of laparoscopy compared with open surgery for both DFS ( HR 0.43 , 95 % CI 0.23-0.78; P = 0.004) and OS ( HR 0.28 , 95 % CI 0.14-0.59; P < 0.001). Despite the limitations of a retrospective analysis , our study confirms better results for laparoscopic surgery in terms of DFS and OS compared with open surgery in CC treatment.
