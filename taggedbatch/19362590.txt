 Huntington 's disease is caused by the pathological expansion of a polyglutamine ( polyQ) stretch in Huntingtin ( Htt) , but the molecular mechanisms by which polyQ expansion in Htt causes toxicity in selective neuronal populations remain poorly understood. Interestingly , heterologous expression of expanded polyQ Htt is toxic in Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> cells , but has no effect in Schizosaccharomyces pombe , a related yeast species possessing very few endogenous polyQ or Q/N-rich proteins. Here , we used a comprehensive and unbiased mass spectrometric approach to identify proteins that bind Htt in a length-dependent manner in both species. Analysis of the expanded polyQ-associated proteins reveals marked enrichment of proteins that are localized to and play functional roles in nucleoli and mitochondria in S.<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> , but not in S. pombe. Moreover , expanded polyQ Htt appears to interact preferentially with endogenous polyQ and Q/N-rich proteins , which are rare in S. pombe , as well as proteins containing coiled-coil motifs in S.<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen>. Taken together , these results suggest that polyQ expansion of Htt may cause cellular toxicity in S.<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> by sequestering endogenous polyQ and Q/N-rich proteins , particularly within nucleoli and mitochondria.
