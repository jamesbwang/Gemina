 Although the term ` cancer ' was still over two thousand years away of being coined , the first known cases of the disease date back to about 3000BC , in ancient Egypt. Five thousand years later , still lacking a cure , it has become one of the leading causes of death , killing over half a dozen million people yearly. So far , monoclonal antibodies are the most successful immune-therapy tools when it comes to fighting cancer. The number of clinical trials that use them has been increasing steadily during the past few years , especially since the Food and Drug Administration greenlit the use of the first immune-checkpoint blockade antibodies. However , albeit successful , this approach does come with the cost of auto-inflammatory toxicity. Taking this into account , the development of new therapeutic reagents with low toxicity becomes evident , particularly ones acting in tandem with the tools currently at our disposal. Ever since its discovery in the early nineties , aptamer technology has been used for a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic applications. With similar properties to those of monoclonal antibodies , such as high-specificity of recognition and high-affinity binding , and the advantages of being developed using
