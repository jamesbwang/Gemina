 While a significant body of bioethical literature considers how the placebo effect might introduce a conflict between autonomy and beneficence , the link between justice and the placebo effect has been neglected. Here , we bring together disparate evidence from the field of placebo studies and research on health inequalities related to race and ethnicity , and argue that , collectively , this evidence may provide the basis for an unacknowledged route by which health disparities are exacerbated. This route is constituted by an uneven distribution of placebo effects , resulting from differences in expressions of physician warmth and empathy , as well as support and patient engagement , across racial and ethnic lines. In a discussion of the ethical implications of this connection , we argue that this contribution to health disparities is a source of injustice , consider ways in which these disparities might be ameliorated and suggest that this conclusion is likely to extend to other realms of inequality as well.
