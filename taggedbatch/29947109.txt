 Ablation of premature ventricular complexes ( PVC) originating from left sided papillary muscles is challenging. We tested a new approach by performing high-density mapping of PVC. We used a 20-pole deflectable spiral catheter during ablation procedures in 4 consecutive patients. Three presented with mitral valve prolapse , one with dilated cardiomyopathy. PVC burden was 24 ± 13 %. The procedures lasted 182 ± 55.4 minutes , including 10 ± 3.2 minutes of radiofrequency. In all patients , mapping evidenced internal primary activation relative to the left ventricle shell ( mean distance 21.3 ± 5.1 mm). Endocavitary prematurity was- 38.3 ± 4.8 ms. Primary ablation success was achieved for all patients. High-density mapping of the papillary muscles in the left ventricle using a spiral catheter may be feasible. We identified the PVC foci away from the left ventricular shell. This consolidates the assumption for the origin of these ectopic beats at the junction between the chordae tendineae and the papillary muscles. This article is protected by copyright.
