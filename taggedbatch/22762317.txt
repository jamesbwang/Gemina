 Vitamin D deficiency is associated with numerous public health issues. Limited data are available for children in southern China , a region that receives abundant sunlight. We aimed to estimate the 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D<pathogen>) levels in children in that area , and to determine seasonal variations in serum 25 ( OH) D<pathogen> levels. A total of 16,755 children aged 0 to 6 years , who visited the Guangdong Women and Children 's Hospital for health examination between January 2016 and May 2017 , were included in the present study. The serum 25 ( OH) D<pathogen> levels ranged from 10.5 to 307.4 nmol/L ( mean ± standard deviation: 78.5 ± 26.3 nmol/L). The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were 10.8 % and 39.0 % , respectively. The mean serum 25 ( OH) D<pathogen> level in spring ( 71.8 ± 24.9 nmol/L) was lower than that in other seasons. From January to April , we found a relatively high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency , both of which were also found to increase with age. Logistic regression analysis revealed that vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were significantly associated with age and season. Deficiency and insufficiency of vitamin D are common among children in southern China , despite the area receiving sufficient sunlight.
