 Advances in xenotransplantation have the potential to resolve the issue of organ shortages. Despite this , the procedure is expected to meet with a degree of resistance from the public. The purpose of this study was to identify the relevant factors influencing stakeholders ' attitudes towards xenotransplantation. A multidimensional survey instrument measuring attitudes to xenotransplantation , including the factors that predict such attitudes , was developed based on earlier studies and validated. It was then completed by 469 respondents who were stratified in accordance with stakeholder groups in Malaysia. A single-step SEM analysis was then conducted to estimate the measurement and create a structural model using IBM SPSS Amos version 20 with a maximum-likelihood function. The attitudes of Malaysian stakeholders towards xenotransplantation were moderately positive ( mean score of 4.20). The most important direct predictor of attitude to xenotransplantation was perceived benefit ( β = 0.59 , P < .001) followed by perceived moral concern ( β = -0.32 , P < .001). Perceived risk had a strong positive association with moral concern ( β = 0.65 , P < .001) , while attitude to nature had a positive association with perceived benefit ( β = 0.16 , P < .01) and a negative association with perceived risk ( β = -0.19 , P < .01). Religiosity had a positive relationship with perceived risk ( β = 0.13 , P < .05) while engagement with biotechnology had a positive relationship with perceived benefits ( β = 0.26 , P < .001) and a negative association with risks ( β = -0.15 , P < .05) and moral issues ( β = -0.11 , P < .05). The Malaysian stakeholders were cautious about xenotransplantation. This study showed that their views regarding the application are complex and multifaceted.
