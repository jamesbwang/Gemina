 Morphogenic culture systems are central to crop improvement programs that utilize transgenic and genome editing technologies. We previously reported that CMD2-type cassava ( Manihot esculenta) cultivars lose resistance to cassava mosaic disease ( CMD) when passed through somatic embryogenesis. As a result , these plants can not be developed as products for deployment where CMD is endemic such as sub-Saharan Africa or the Indian sub-continent. In order to increase understanding of this phenomenon , 21 African cassava cultivars were screened for resistance to CMD after regeneration through somatic embryogenesis. Fifteen cultivars were shown to retain resistance to CMD through somatic embryogenesis , confirming that the existing transformation and gene editing systems can be employed in these genetic backgrounds without compromising resistance to geminivirus infection. CMD2-type cultivars were also subjected to plant regeneration via caulogenesis and meristem tip culture , resulting in 25-36 % and 5-10 % of regenerated plant lines losing resistance to CMD respectively. This study provides clear evidence that multiple morphogenic systems can result in loss of resistance to CMD , and that somatic embryogenesis per se is not the underlying cause of this phenomenon. The information described here is critical for interpreting genomic , transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets aimed at understanding CMD resistance mechanisms in cassava.
