 The mushroom body ( MB) in insects is known as a major center for associative learning and memory , although exact locations for the correlating memory traces remain to be elucidated. Here , we asked whether presynaptic boutons of olfactory projection neurons ( PNs) in the main input site of the MB undergo neuronal plasticity during classical odor-reward conditioning and correlate with the conditioned behavior. We simultaneously measured Ca
