 None A total of 52 patients , including 36 PD , eight APD and eight nPD-nAPD , underwent both MIBG myocardial scintigraphy and DAT-SPECT , were evaluated. The heart-to-mediastinum ( H/M) ratios ( early and delayed) , washout-rate ( WR) , the average ( Ave) and asymmetry index ( AI) of specific binding ratio ( SBR) were calculated. Cutoff values were determined , using ROC analysis , for discriminating PD from APD and for discriminating PD from nPD-nAPD , on five parameters. All cases were scored as either 1 ( PD) or 0 ( nPD-nAPD or APD) for each parameter according to its threshold in each discrimination. These individual scores were summed for each case , yielding a combined score to obtain a cutoff value for the MSS in each discrimination. For discriminating PD from nPD-nAPD , the highest accuracy was 80 % at a cutoff value of 19 % for the WR and a cut off value of 2 improved diagnostic accuracy to 84 % for MSS. For discriminating PD from APD , the highest accuracy was 86 % at a cutoff value of 2.8 for the H/M ratio ( late) and a cut off value of 2 showed diagnostic accuracy of 86 % for MSS. A MSS has comparable or better accuracy compared to each parameter of MIBG myocardial scintigraphy and DAT-SPECT in distinguishing PD from nPD-nAPD or distinguishing PD from APD.
