 There is a growing interest in the use of We compared the proposed method to a fixed threshold ( SUV > 1) and manual segmentation by two readers and piloted the technique successfully on scans of five control patients and five PTB cases ( four cured and one failed treatment case) , at diagnosis and after 1 and 6 months of treatment. There was a better correlation between the Z-score-based segmentation and manual segmentation than SUV > 1 and manual segmentation in terms of overall spatial overlap ( measured in Dice similarity coefficient) and specificity ( 1 minus false positive volume fraction). However , SUV > 1 segmentation appeared more sensitive. Both the Z-score and SUV > 1 showed very low variability when measuring change over time. In addition , total glycolytic activity , calculated using segmentation by Z-score and lesion-to-background ratio , correlated well with traditional total glycolytic activity calculations. The technique quantified various PET and CT parameters , including the total glycolytic activity index , metabolic lesion<symptom> volume , lesion<symptom> volumes at different CT densities and combined PET and CT parameters. The quantified metrics showed a marked decrease in the cured cases , with changes already apparent at month one , but remained largely unchanged in the failed treatment case. Our technique is promising to segment and quantify the lung scans of pulmonary tuberculosis<disease> patients in a semi-automatic manner , appropriate for measuring treatment response. Further validation is required in larger cohorts.
