 Despite increasing evidence for the involvement of bone<disease> marrow ( BM) hematopoietic stem cell niche in leukemogenesis , how BM mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells ( MSPCs) contribute to leukemia<disease> niche formation and progression remains unclear. Using an MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) mouse model , we demonstrate dynamic alterations of BM cellular niche components , including MSPCs and endothelial cells during AML development and its association with AML engraftment. Primary patient AML cells also induced similar niche alterations in xenografted mice. AML cell infiltration in BM causes an expansion of early B-cell factor 2
