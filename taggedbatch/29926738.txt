 Vaccination against hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) is recommended in people living with HIV<pathogen> ( PLHIV) , although immune response rates are lower than in healthy individuals. We aimed at assessing response rates and predictors as well as persistence of seroprotection in a cohort of PLHIV with no serological evidence of current or previous HBV<pathogen> infection. PLHIV followed at our site were retrospectively included if they started a primary HBV vaccination course ( 20 mcg dose three-doses schedule , alone or combined with inactivated hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> A<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen>) between 2007 and 2012. Serological response was defined as HBsAb ≥ 10 IU/L 4 to 24 weeks after the third vaccine dose. Among 134 patients included , 119 completed the primary HBV vaccination schedule. Of them , 68 % developed serological response. HIV<pathogen> viral suppression was associated with HBsAb ≥ 10 IU/L ( adjustedOR 0.52 , 95 % CI 0.33-0.82 , p = 0.005) , while CD4-T cell count was not ( adjustedOR 1.001 , 95 % CI 1.001-1.003 , p = 0.1). HBsAb titer declined over time , since 69.3 % and 26.9 % of vaccinees had HBsAb ≥ 10 IU/L 36 and 84 months after the third HBV<pathogen> vaccine dose. Time-updated CD4-T cell count were associated with persistence of seroprotection ( adjustedHR 1.17 , 95 % CI 1.06-1.30 , p = 0.003) , independently from quantitative HBsAg titer achieved at the end of the primary vaccination schedule ( HR 1.02 , 95 % CI 0.96-1.08 , p = 0.64). The longer the time interval from vaccination the higher the risk of loss of seroprotection. Repeating HBsAb titer 5 years after a successful HBV<pathogen> vaccination may be used to guide booster vaccination , as the majority of subjects may no longer have seroprotective HbsAb titers.
