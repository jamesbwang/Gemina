 This article summarizes the current study situation on treatment of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis and discusses the evidence situation in the literature. The 10-year results of the ACST study have shown that in comparison to conservative treatment , carotid endarterectomy ( CEA) has retained a positive long-term effect on the reduction of all forms of stroke. All multicenter randomized controlled trials comparing CEA with carotid artery stenting ( CAS) and , in particular the SAPHIRE and CAVATAS studies , have in common that despite a basic evidence level of Ib , the case numbers of asymptomatic patients are too small for a conclusive therapy recommendation. In the overall assessment of the CREST study the resulting difference in the questionable endpoint of `` perioperative myocardial infarction '' in favor of the CAS methods , could not be confirmed for exclusively asymptomatic patients. In the long-term course of the CREST study , both methods were classified as equivalent , even when the 4â€‘year results of periprocedural and postprocedural stroke rates in the separate assessment of the asymptomatic study participants clearly favored the CEA. The results of the ACST-1 study showed an equivalent effect of both treatment methods with respect to all investigated endpoints; however , the unequal sizes of the groups in addition to the statistically insufficient case numbers put a question mark on the validity of the study results. The results of the ASCT-2 and CREST-2 studies are to be awaited , which also investigate the significance of `` CEA versus CAS '' ( ASCT-2) and `` CEA/CAS + best medical treatment ( BMT) versus BMT alone '' in only asymptomatic stenoses. The current S3 guidelines allow operative therapy to be considered in patients with a 60-99 % asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis , because the risk of stroke is statistically significantly reduced.
