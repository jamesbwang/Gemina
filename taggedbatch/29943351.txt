 Dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT) is a cornerstone of treatment for patients with acute coronary syndromes<disease><symptom> ( ACS). Mounting evidences have opened the debate about the optimal DAPT duration. Considering the ACS-pathophysiology , the most recent guidelines recommend DAPT in all ACS patients for at least 12 months unless there are contraindications such as excessive risk of bleeding. Thus , it can be considered acceptable earlier discontinuation if the risk of morbidity from bleeding outweighs the anticipated benefit. On the other hand , several studies have clearly indicated that a significant burden of platelet related-events , such as stroke and new ACS might occur after this period , suggesting that potential benefits might derive by prolonging DAPT beyond 12 months ( Long DAPT). Indeed , although current guidelines give some indications about patients eligible for Long DAPT , they do not embrace several real-life clinical scenarios. Thus , in such scenarios , how to decide whether a patient is eligible for Long DAPT or not might be still challenging for clinicians. This position paper presents and discusses various `` real-life '' clinical scenarios in ACS patients , in order to propose several possible recommendations to overcome guidelines potential limitations.
