 A Trichoderma<pathogen> orientale strain LSBA1 was isolated from the Mediterranean marine sponge Cymbaxinella damicornis. The crude extract of T. orientale mycelium showed inhibitory activity against growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as clinical isolates of Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen>. Purification of the anti-Candida component was performed using a combination of open silica gel-60 column and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The active compound called hyporientalin A has been identified as a peptaibol analogue of longibrachin-A-II using mass spectrometry. It exhibited fungicidal activity against clinical isolates of C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> with minimal inhibitory concentrations ( MICs) ranging from 2.49 to 19.66 ÂµM , comparable to that of the antifungal agent amphotericin B. Our data support the use of hyporientalin A as a promising new and efficient antifungal drug in the treatment of candidiasis while controlling toxicity.
