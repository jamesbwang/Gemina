 The present study aimed to explore the use of meaning-making coping mechanisms ( existential , spiritual and religious coping) among ethnic Malay cancer patients in Malaysia and to investigate the impact of culture on their choice of coping methods. Twenty-nine participants with various kinds of cancer were interviewed. Four kinds of coping resources emerged from analyses of the interview transcripts: ( 1) relying on transcendent power , ( 2) supernatural or mystical beliefs , ( 3) finding oneself in relationships with others and ( 4) nature. In this article , the two first resources are in focus. The present findings suggest that Malay culture , which is imbued with Islamic belief , strongly influences cancer patients ' coping methods and ways of looking at their experience of being cancer patients.
