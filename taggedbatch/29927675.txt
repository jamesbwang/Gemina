 Alcohol consumption and related consequences is a problem on many college campuses. Tailgating parties before college sporting events may be contributing , however , little recent research has investigated alcohol consumption at these events. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the drinking behaviors of college game day tailgate attendees and subsequent alcohol-related consequences. Participants ( N = 89; 44.9 % female) were recruited from tailgates at a university in the Midwest United States on college football game days during fall 2014. Participants provided a breath sample , completed a questionnaire , and were given the opportunity to participate in a follow-up survey ( n = 62) to assess resulting alcohol-related consequences. Over half of participants had BrACs greater than 0.000. However , one in three participants reported intentions to abstain from alcohol or to drink but not enough to get buzzed. Intoxication intentions were a significant and unique predictor of alcohol consumption and experience with alcohol-related consequences at follow-up. Conclusions/Importance: This study updates and extends the literature on alcohol-related consequences in the context of college football tailgates. The results suggest that consequences may be prevented through changes in intentions to become intoxicated.
