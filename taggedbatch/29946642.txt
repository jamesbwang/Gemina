 This clinical study was to evaluate oral health-related quality of life ( OHRQoL) changes in patients who underwent all-on-4 treatment in one or both jaws. Eleven patients underwent placement of 4 to 6 dental implants on the basis of all-on-4 treatment concept in the maxilla , mandible or both jaws and immediate loading with acrylic interim prostheses. The prostheses were replaced after 3-6 months , and definitive prostheses with metal framework and reinforced resin facing were fixed after another 3 months or more. The subjects completed the shortened Chinese version of the Oral Health Impact Profile ( OHIP-14) before surgery ( T0) , 1 week after interim prostheses were placed ( T1) and 3 months after definitive prosthesis placement ( T2). The data of 11 subjects were analyzed with Wilcoxon signed-rank test using SPSS 13.0 software package. The total OHIP-14 score significantly reduced only at T2 ( P < 0.05). `` Functional limitation , '' `` physical pain , '' `` physical disability , '' and `` psychological disability '' scores significantly decreased at T2 , and `` psychological discomfort '' scores also significantly dropped at T1. `` Social disability '' and `` handicap '' scores remained unchanged throughout the treatment course. Fixed definitive prostheses with metal framework are more effective in improving OHRQoL than fixed acrylic prostheses during all-on-4 treatments.
