 Nuclear receptor interacting protein ( NRIP1) , also known as RIP140 , is a transcriptional coregulator that is required for the maintenance of energy homeostasis and ovulation. Although several studies have identified roles for NRIP1 in various cell processes , the biological functions of NRIP1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC) remain unknown. In the present study , we demonstrate that NRIP1 inhibited the migration and invasion of ESCC cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that NRIP1 is directly targeted by miR-548-3p and miR-576-5p. Next , we show that miR-548-3p and miR-576-5p regulated the migration and invasion of ESCC cells via inhibiting NRIP1 expression. Interestingly , in ESCC cell lines and ESCC tissues , expression of miR-548-3p and miR-576-5p was upregulated and NRIP1 was downregulated relative to the control. A statistically significant inverse association was found between the expression level of miR-548-3p/ miR-576-5p and NRIP1. Taken together , our results reveal novel functions for miR-548-3p , miR-576-5p , and NRIP1 in regulating ESCC cell migration and invasion , important functions for the metastatic process in esophageal cancer.
