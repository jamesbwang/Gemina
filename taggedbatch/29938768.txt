 The epidermis is the outer covering of the skin and provides a protective interface between the body and the environment. It is well established that the epidermis is maintained by stem cells that self-renew and generate differentiated cells. In this review , we discuss how recent technological advances , including single cell transcriptomics and in vivo imaging , have provided new insights into the nature and plasticity of the stem cell compartment and the differing roles of stem cells in homeostasis , wound<disease><symptom> repair and cancer.
