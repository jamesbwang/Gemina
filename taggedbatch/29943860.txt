 The accurate quantification of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in indoor air has recently attracted increasing attention. Here , we investigated whether the susceptibility of a nosocomial infection-related microbe , Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> , to strong sampling stress caused by Nuclepore filter changes as it develops resistance to a drug called colistin. Both colistin-sensitive A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> ( CSAB) and colistin-resistant A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> ( CRAB) are generally desiccation-resistant strains that can be collected by filter sampling. However , the resistance of CRAB to the three combined stresses ( aerosolization , impaction , and desiccation) caused by filter sampling was 1.8 times lower than that of CSAB ( P < 0.05). The sampling stresses caused by filter sampling not only reduced the culturability of A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> but also destroyed proteins to result in cellular protein leakage. CRAB released 17 % -38 % more extracellular protein than did CSAB when they were both subjected to desiccation stress for 240 minutes ( P < 0.01). The combination of using a sampling flow rate of 20 L/min and sampling for 60 minutes with a Nuclepore filter with open-face cassettes ( OFCs) is recommended for collecting airborne A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen>. A Nuclepore filter operated with closed-face cassettes ( CFCs) significantly decreased the culturability of CRAB due to desiccation effects.
