 Small cell lung cancer ( SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy with a critical need for novel therapies. Our goal was to determine whether PARP inhibition could sensitize SCLC cells to ionizing radiation ( IR) and if so , to determine the contribution of PARP trapping to radiosensitization. Short-term viability assays and clonogenic survival assays ( CSA) were used to assess radiosensitization in six SCLC cell lines. Doses of veliparib and talazoparib with equivalent enzymatic inhibitory activity but differing PARP trapping activity were identified and compared in CSAs. Talazoparib , IR , and their combination were tested in three patient-derived xenograft ( PDX) models. Talazoparib radiosensitized 5 of 6 SCLC cell lines in short-term viability assays and confirmed in 3 of 3 cell lines by CSAs. Concentrations of 200 nM talazoparib and 1600 nM veliparib similarly inhibited PAR polymerization; however , talazoparib exhibited greater PARP trapping activity that was associated with superior radiosensitization. This observation further correlated with an increased number of double-stranded DNA breaks induced by talazoparib as compared to veliparib. Finally , a dose of 0.2 mg/kg talazoparib in vivo caused tumor growth inhibition in combination with IR but not as a single agent in 3 SCLC PDX models. PARP inhibition effectively sensitizes SCLC cell lines and PDXs to IR , and PARP trapping activity enhances this effect. PARP inhibitors , especially those with high PARP trapping activity , may provide a powerful tool to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy in SCLC.
