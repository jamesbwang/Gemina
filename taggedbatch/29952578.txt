 Combining the life span developmental perspective with the process perspective of entrepreneurship , we develop hypotheses on the role of age in the entrepreneurial process. Specifically , we expect that younger people have a more extensive future time perspective than older people , which makes it more likely for younger ( vs. older) people to transition from opportunity identification to forming entrepreneurial intentions. Further , we expect that older people have greater prior entrepreneurial experience than younger people , which makes it more likely for older ( vs. younger) people to transition from forming entrepreneurial intentions to engaging in entrepreneurial activity. We tested our hypotheses using longitudinal data from 343 working adults from Australia across 12 months with 3 measurement waves. Results supported our hypotheses. Our findings suggest that age-related constructs can facilitate and hinder transitions in the entrepreneurial process. ( PsycINFO Database Record
