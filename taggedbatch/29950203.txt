 To explore the influence of FLT3-ITD mutation and ITD length on the overall survival ( OS) and relapse free survival ( RFS) in patients with non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia<disease>. Clinical features and therapeutic effect were retrospectively analyzed in 75 AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation and 76 FLT3-ITD AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation had higher WBC count and the ratio of BM blast cells at initial diagnosis was also higher than those in AML patients without FLT3-ITD mutation ( 95.13 vs 10.85) ( P < 0.01); 72 % vs 59 % ( P < 0.01). The CR rates in AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation less than those in AML patients without FLT3-ITD mutation ( 70.42 % vs 94.7 %) ( P < 0.01). OS ( P < 0.01) and RFS ( P < 0.01) were significantly increased in patients with AML who received allo-HSCT as compared with the patients who received consolidation chemotherapy and similar to AML patients without FLT3-ITD mutation who received HSCT. Patients with maintenance sorafenib after HSCT had longer OS ( P < 0.05) and RFS ( P < 0.05) than controls. ITDs exceeding 60 bp in length were associated with decreasing OS as compared with shorter ITD in AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation ( P < 0.05). OS and RFS were similar among the 2 groups receiving consolidation chemotherapy. Besides , the patients with allo-HSCT had shorter ITDs and longer OS than ITDs exceeding 60 bp ( P < 0.05) and similar to AML patients without FLT3-ITD mutation. AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation has poorer outcome , among which the prognosis was worse in patients with ITD exceeding 60 bp , and the chemotherapy alone can not improve the prognosis of FLT3-ITD
