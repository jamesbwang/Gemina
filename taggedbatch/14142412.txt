 Von Hipple-Lindua ( VHL) syndrome<pathogen><disease><symptom> is an autosomal dominant neoplastic disorder in which multiple benign or malignant tumours and cysts<symptom> develop in central nervous system and visceral organs. Retinal capillary hemangioma is the most frequent and often the earliest manifestation of VHL syndrome<disease><symptom>. We report a case with multisystemic involvement diagnosed as a case of multiple endocrine neoplasia ( MEN) syndrome<pathogen><disease><symptom> but the presence of multiple , unilateral peripheral and juxtapapillary retinal capillary hemangioma was able to clinche the definative diagnosis of VHL and thus helped in appropriate management of the patient.
