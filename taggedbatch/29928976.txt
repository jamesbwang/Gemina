 Clostridium<pathogen> chauvoei causes fatal black quarter infection in cattle and buffaloes. The quorum sensing ( QS) system , a bacterial cell to cell communication process , of the pathogen was characterized in the current study. The results indicated that C. chauvoei lacked luxS ( autoinducer-2) based quorum sensing as detected by the sensor strain Vibrio<pathogen> harveyi<pathogen> BB170. This was supported by absence of luxS gene in C. chauvoei genome. However , the genomic analysis indicated the presence of agrBD system in all three genomes of C. chauvoei available at the NCBI database. The AgrD , which synthesizes QS messenger auto-inducing peptide , was a 44 amino acid protein which shared 59 % identity and 75 % similarity with AgrD of C.<pathogen> perfringens<pathogen><disease> strain 13 and 56 % identity ( 20 % coverage) with Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> N315. The functional cysteine amino acid was conserved in all the strains. The genomic organisation further suggests the presence of diguanylate cyclase , a gene responsible for synthesis of secondary messenger cyclic di-GMP , at 3 ' immediate downstream of agrD gene. The real time expression analysis for agrD gene indicated that expression was better at 37 °C ( 1.9-3.7 fold increase) compared to a higher temperature of 40 °C. However , stable expression was observed at different growth stages ( log and early stationary phase) with 0.8-1.4 fold changes in expression pattern. The results indicate the presence of a constitutively expressed agrBD quorum sensing system in C. chauvoei.
