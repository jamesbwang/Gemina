 Some authors have found little or no diagnostic benefit from repeated biopsy of benign thyroid nodules<symptom>. However , to our knowledge , integration of Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System ( TIRADS) guidelines with one biopsy for sufficient benign thyroid nodule<disease> diagnosis has not been previously described. We investigated malignancy rate and probability by using various malignancy stratification systems in initially biopsy-proven benign nodules<symptom> and sought to determine their clinical relevance in management of benign thyroid nodules<symptom>. This retrospective study collected 6762 thyroid nodules<symptom> from 6493 consecutive patients who underwent biopsy between January 2013 and December 2013. The initial biopsy with ≥ 1 year of follow-up was used as the gold standard for benign diagnosis. For our study purpose , we analyzed 2747 ( 57.0 % , 2747 of 4822 , 532 women , 2111 men; 229 malignant and 2518 benign) thyroid nodules<symptom> diagnosed by initial biopsy with 28.2 ± 9.1 ( range , 12-41) months of follow-up. We calculated the malignancy probability of thyroid nodules<symptom> by using various malignancy risk stratification systems. The overall calculated thyroid malignancy rate was 8.3 % ( 229 of 2747). Initially biopsy-proven benign nodules<symptom> exhibited a ≤ 3.0 % malignancy probability when assessed as `` low suspicion '' by Korean-TIRADS ( K-TIRADS) , `` low suspicion '' by the ATA guideline , and `` very probably benign '' by the French TIRADS guideline and gave a score of ≤ 3 by the web-based TIRADS. When initially biopsy-proven benign nodules<symptom> exhibit a `` low suspicion '' US pattern and low malignancy probability , as stratified by various TIRADS guidelines , imaging surveillance instead of second biopsy is warranted. • One biopsy is sufficient for initially biopsy-proven benign nodules<symptom>. • Repetitive biopsy is necessary for imaging-pathology mismatched nodules<symptom>. • Scoring risk stratification permits personalized management.
