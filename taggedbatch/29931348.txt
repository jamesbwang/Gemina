 Geminiviruses , such as beet severe curly top virus ( BSCTV) , are a group of DNA viruses that cause severe plant diseases and agricultural losses. The C4 protein is a major symptom determinant in several geminiviruses; however , its regulatory mechanism and molecular function in plant cells remain unclear. Here , we show that BSCTV C4 is S-acylated in planta , and that this post-translational lipid modification is necessary for its membrane localization and functions , especially its regulation of shoot development of host plants. Furthermore , the S-acylated form of C4 interacts with CLAVATA 1 ( CLV1) , an important receptor kinase in meristem maintenance , and consequentially affects the expression of WUSCHEL , a major target of CLV1. The abnormal development of siliques in Arabidopsis thaliana infected with BSCTV is also dependent on the S-acylation of C4 , implying a potential role of CLAVATA signaling in this process. Collectively , S-acylation is essential for BSCTV C4 function , including the regulation of the CLAVATA<pathogen> pathway , during geminivirus infection.
