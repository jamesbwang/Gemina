 Chemical labeling ( CL) in combination with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ( LC-MS) analysis has been demonstrated to be a promising technology in metabolomic analysis. However , identification of chemically labeled metabolites remains to be challenging. Retention time ( RT) is one of the most important parameters for the identification of metabolites , but it could vary greatly in LC-MS analysis. In this work , we developed a chemical labeling-based HPLC retention index ( CL-HPLC RI) strategy to facilitate the identification of metabolites. In this CL-HPLC RI strategy , a series of 2-dimethylaminoethylamine ( DMED)- labeled fatty acids were used as calibrants to establish RIs for DMED-labeled carboxylated compounds and a series of 4- ( N , N-dimethylamino) phenyl isothiocyanate ( DMAP)- labeled fatty amines were used as calibrants for DMAP-labeled amine compunds. To calculate the RIs , the whole LC chromatogram was divided into 24 time intervals by 23 DMED-labeled fatty acid standards or 15 time intervals by 14 DMAP-labeled fatty amine standards. Then , we established the RIs of 854 detected DMED-labeled carboxylated metabolites and 1057 DMAP-labeled amine metabolites in fecal samples and demonstrated that RIs were highly reproducible under different elution gradients , columns , and instrument systems. Finally , we applied this strategy to the identification of metabolites in human serum. Using RIs , 267 DMED-labeled carboxylated metabolites and 273 DMAP-labeled amine metabolites in human serum matched well with the fecal metabolome database. Taken together , the developed CL-HPLC RI strategy was demonstrated to be a promising method to facilitate the identification of metabolites in metabolomic analysis.
