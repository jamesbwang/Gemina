 Spray drying technology was used to produce co-processed excipients mannitol- hydroxypropyl methylcellulose ( HPMC) , and study the scaled-up production. The consistency of powder and tablet properties before and after scale-up of co-processed excipients was compared , and their applicability in traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM) powder 's direct compression was tested on five TCM extracts such as gardenia extract and Radix Paeoniae Alba extract. It was shown that after scaled-up production , the key properties of co-processed excipients had little changes ( such as compactability , disintegrating time , and lubrication sensitivity) or improvement ( such as flowability and yield). As compared to commercially available spray-dried mannitol , co-processed excipients achieved better compactability and higher drug loading for direction compression of TCM powder. In conclusion , the mannitol-HPMC co-processed excipient , with excellent physicomechanical properties , is promising to be explored as a new excipient for direct powder compression.
