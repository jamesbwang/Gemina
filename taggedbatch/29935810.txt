 To evaluate whether endometrioma is associated with a progressive decline in ovarian reserve , and to compare the rate of decline with natural decline in ovarian reserve. Prospective , observational study. Tertiary university hospital , endometriosis clinic. Forty women with endometrioma and 40 age-matched healthy controls. Women with endometriomas who did not need hormonal/surgical treatment at the time of recruitment and were expectantly managed. Controls were age-matched , healthy women. All participants underwent serum antim√ºllerian hormone ( AMH) testing twice , 6 months apart. Sexually active patients with endometrioma also underwent antral follicle count. Change in serum AMH levels. Median ( 25th-75th percentile) serum AMH level at recruitment was 2.83 ( 0.70-4.96) ng/mL in the endometrioma group and 4.42 ( 2.26-5.57) ng/mL in the control group. The median percent decline in serum AMH level was 26.4 % ( 11.36 % -55.41 %) in the endometrioma group and 7.4 % ( -11.98 % , 29.33 %) in the control groups. Twenty-two women with endometrioma who had antral follicle count ( AFC) had median AFC of 10 ( 8-12) at recruitment and 8 ( 6.3-10) at 6 months. Women with endometrioma experience a progressive decline in serum AMH levels , which is faster than that in healthy women. NCT02438735.
