 Two new naphthotubes with ester linkers were synthesized and characterized. With the syn isomers of an ester naphthotube and an ether naphthotube , strong positive allosteric cooperativity in a ternary complex with two different hosts on one guest was achieved. This paves the way to construct robust supramolecular architectures with high complexity and diversity.
