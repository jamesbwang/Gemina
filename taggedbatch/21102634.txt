 Abnormal centrosome number and function have been implicated in tumour development. LIM kinase1 ( LIMK1) , a regulator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics , is found to localize at the mitotic centrosome. However , its role at the centrosome is not fully explored. Here , we report that LIMK1 depletion resulted in multi-polar spindles and defocusing of centrosomes , implicating its involvement in the regulation of mitotic centrosome integrity. LIMK1 could influence centrosome integrity by modulating centrosomal protein localization at the spindle pole. Interestingly , dynein light intermediate chains ( LICs) are able to rescue the defects observed in LIMK1-depleted cells. We found that LICs are potential novel interacting partners and substrates of LIMK1 and that LIMK1 phosphorylation regulates cytoplasmic dynein function in centrosomal protein transport , which in turn impacts mitotic spindle pole integrity.
