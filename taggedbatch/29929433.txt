 The primary aim of the study that this article reports was to model and test a social ecological explanation of resilience as explained by Ungar. Its secondary aim was to investigate resilience-promoting supports in school-going Black South African adolescents. School attendance was specified as a culturally appropriate , functional outcome of resilience. The Pathways to Resilience Research Project gathered data through the Pathways to Resilience Youth Measure. Seven hundred and thirty school-going adolescents ( age 12-19 years , 388 female , 341 male , one unspecified) from Thabo Mofutsanyana District , in South Africa 's Free State province , participated in this cross-sectional study. Latent variable modeling was used to test measurement models of adolescents ' self-reported perceptions of social ecological contributions ( resources and risks) to their resilience. A complex model based on a social ecological explanation of resilience fitted the data best. The structural model showed that the resilience process predicted 32 % of the variance in school attendance. Social skills , cultural , and spiritual resources were most supportive of adolescents ' resilience. The results confirmed that the complex model explained resilience in Black South African adolescents as a person-context relational process and prompt principals , parents , teachers , and governmental departments to encourage school attendance.
