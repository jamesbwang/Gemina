 Methane-producing bioelectrochemical systems generate methane by using microorganisms to reduce carbon dioxide at the cathode with external electricity supply. This technology provides an innovative approach for renewable electricity conversion and storage. Two key factors that need further attention are production of methane at high rate , and stable performance under intermittent electricity supply. To study these key factors , we have used two electrode materials: granular activated carbon ( GAC) and graphite granules ( GG). Under galvanostatic control , the biocathodes achieved methane production rates of around 65 L CH
