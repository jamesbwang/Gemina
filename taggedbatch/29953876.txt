 Human gut microbiota play an important role in maintaining human health. Dietary fibers , i.e. prebiotics , are fermented by human gut microbiota into the short-chain fatty acids ( SCFAs) acetate , propionate , and butyrate. SCFAs promote fat oxidation and improve metabolic health. Therefore , the prebiotic inulin might be an effective dietary strategy to improve human metabolism. We aimed to investigate the acute metabolic effects of ingesting inulin compared with digestible carbohydrates and to trace inulin-derived SCFAs using stable isotope tracer methodology. In a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled crossover design , 14 healthy , overweight to obese men consumed a high-fat milkshake containing A) 24 g inulin of which 0.5 g was U- Fat oxidation increased in the early postprandial phase ( 0-3 h) , and both plasma glucose and insulin were lower after INU ingestion compared with PLA ( all P < 0.05). Plasma free fatty acids were higher in the early , and lower in the late postprandial period after INU ingestion. Inulin was fermented into SCFAs as indicated by higher plasma acetate concentrations after INU compared with PLA ( P < 0.05). In addition , we found continuous increases in plasma Ingestion of the prebiotic inulin improves fat oxidation and promotes SCFA production in overweight to obese men. Overall , replacing digestible carbohydrates with the fermentable inulin may favor human substrate metabolism. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov under number NCT02009670.
