 BioZorb ® is a tumor bed marker placed during partial mastectomy for targeted post-operative radiation. This study was designed to evaluate BioZorb ® effect on radiation boost clinical target volume ( CTV) , planning target volume ( PTV) , median dose to ipsilateral lung ( Gy) , and heart irradiation in left-sided cancers. Data was collected via a retrospective cohort study with two study arms: BioZorb ® intra-operative placement versus no BioZorb ® placement. Patients were stratified by BMI , age , tumor laterality and volume , and cancer stage. Mean , standard deviation , median , range of cubic centimeters of clinical and planning target volume , cardiac dose in left-sided cancers , ipsilateral lung dose , and volume of ipsilateral lung receiving 20 Gy were reported. Of 143 patients , median CTV ( cm The BioZorb ® arm showed statistically significant reductions in CTV and PTV but not ipsilateral lung or heart irradiation.
