 The human patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 ( PNPLA3) gene encodes for a protein of 481 amino-acids. The variant rs738409 is a cytosine to guanine substitution , encoding for the isoleucine to methionine substitution at position 148 ( I148M) of the protein. This variant is strongly associated with the entire spectrum of liver disease. Although this variant is one of the best characterized and deeply studied , the mechanism behind the PNPLA3 and the liver disease is still not well defined. Functionally , it has become clear that the PNPLA3 protein is an enzyme with lipase activity towards triglycerides and retinyl esters , and acyltransferase activity on phospholipids. The aim of this review is to collect the latest data , obtained by in vitro and in vivo experiments , on the functional aspects of the PNPLA3 protein. Defining the precise role of PNPLA3 in the liver lipid metabolism , in order to develop novel therapies for the treatment of liver disease , will be the key of future research.
