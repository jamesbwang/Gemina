 We have found that OFF-riboswitches that ligand-dependently downregulate the canonical translation in a higher eukaryotic expression system ( wheat germ extract) can be easily created by inserting a single aptamer into the 5 ' untranslated region ( UTR) of mRNA , even if its ligand is as small as theophylline. The key is the position of the inserted aptamer: the 5 ' end ( +0 position) is much better than other positions for inhibiting canonical translation with the aptamer-ligand complex. The data showed that ribosome loading is suppressed by a rigid structure in the 5 ' end , and this suppression is dependent on the structure 's stability but not on its size. Although this preference of aptamer insertion point contradicts the results in a lower eukaryote , it accords with the fact that the 5 '- end structural hindrance is more effective for blocking the ribosome in higher eukaryotes. Therefore , the present type of OFF-riboswitch would function in various higher eukaryotic expression systems.
