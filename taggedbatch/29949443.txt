 The Alternative Model for Personality Disorders ( AMPD) in Section III of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition , recommends the joint consideration of personality disorder severity ( i.e. , dysfunction) and style ( i.e. , trait profile) in personality disorder diagnosis. The current study examined the association between maladaptive personality dysfunction and traits using a Singaporean student sample ( N = 360). A subsample ( n = 151) had informant ratings of personality traits on target participants. Results indicated that dysfunctions and traits were substantially correlated , calling into question their distinctiveness. However , the overlap was less pronounced when informant ratings were used. Consistent with prior research , the validity of the PID-5 trait model appeared to be supported , as observed in the meaningful differential relations with different impairment outcomes. These findings represent a preliminary yet critical test of the generalizability of the AMPD to a non-Western cultural group.
