 Traditional classification of melanoma is widely utilized with little apparent results making the development of robust classifiers that can guide therapies an urgency. Successful seminal research on classification has provided a wider understanding of cancer from multiple molecular profiles , respectively. However , it may ignore the complementary nature of the information provided by different types of data , which motivated us to subtype melanoma by aggregating multiple genomic platform data. Aggregating three omics data of 328 melanoma samples , melanoma subtyping was performed by three clustering methods. Differences across subtypes were extracted by functional enrichment , epigenetically silencing , gene mutations and clinical features. Subtypes were further distinguished by putative biomarkers. Functional enrichment of the subtype-specific differential expression genes endowed subtypes new designation: immune , melanin and ion , in which the first subtype was enriched for immune system , the second was characterized by melanin and pigmentation , and the third was enriched for ion-involved transmission process. Subtypes also differed in age , Breslow thickness , tumor site , mutation frequency of BRAF , PTGS2 , CDKN2A , CDKN2B and incidence of epigenetically silencing for IL15RA , EPSTI1 , LXN , CDKN1B genes. Skin cutaneous melanoma can be robustly divided into three subtypes by SNFCC
