 The microbial communities responsible for the degradation of poly ( lactic acid)/ poly ( 3-hydroxybutyrate) ( PLA/PHB) blend foils were investigated in 1 year long laboratory soil burial experiments. Different PLA/PHB foils were tested: ( a) PLA/PHB original transparent foil , ( b) PLA/PHB carbon black filled foil and ( c) PLA/PHB black foil previously exposed for 90 days to sun light. The microbiome diversity of these three types of foil was compared with that identified from soil/perlite sample at the beginning of experiment and that developed on a cellulose mat. Culture-dependent and culture-independent ( DGGE-cloning) approaches together with PLA , PHB and PLA/PHB degradation plate assays were employed. The cultivation strategy combined with degradation tests permitted the isolation and evaluation of several PLA/PHB blend degrading microorganisms such as members of the genera Bacillus<pathogen> , Paenibacillus<pathogen> , Streptomyces , Rhodococcus<pathogen> , Saccharothrix , Arthrobacter<pathogen> , Aureobasidium<pathogen> , Mortierella , Absidia , Actinomucor<pathogen> , Bjerkandera , Fusarium<pathogen> , Trichoderma and Penicillium. The DGGE-cloning investigation increased the information about the microbial communities occurring during bioplastic degradation detecting several bacterial and fungal taxa and some of them ( members of the orders Anaerolineales , Selenomonadales , Thelephorales and of the genera Pseudogymnoascus<pathogen> and Pseudeurotium<pathogen>) were revealed here for the first time. This survey showed the microbiome colonizing PLA/PHB blend foils and permitted the isolation of several microorganisms able to degrade the tested polymeric blends.
