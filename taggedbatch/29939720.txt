 Increasing protein expression levels is a key step in the commercial production of enzymes. Predicting promoter activity and translation initiation efficiency based solely on consensus sequences have so far met with mixed results. Here , we addressed this challenge using a `` brute-force '' approach by designing and synthesizing a large combinatorial library comprising âˆ¼ 12000 unique synthetic expression modules ( SEMs) for Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen>. Using GFP fluorescence as a reporter of gene expression , we obtained a dynamic expression range that spanned 5 orders of magnitude , as well as a maximal 13-fold increase in expression compared with that of the already strong veg expression module. Analyses of the synthetic modules indicated that sequences at the 5 '- end of the mRNA were the most important contributing factor to the differences in expression levels , presumably by preventing formation of strong secondary mRNA structures that affect translation initiation. When the gfp coding region was replaced by the coding region of the xynA gene , encoding the industrially relevant B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> xylanase enzyme , only a 3-fold improvement in xylanase production was observed. Moreover , the correlation between GFP and xylanase expression levels was weak. This suggests that the differences in expression levels between the gfp and xynA constructs were due to differences in 5 '- end mRNA folding and consequential differences in the rates of translation initiation. Our data show that the use of large libraries of SEMs , in combination with high-throughput technologies , is a powerful approach to improve the production of a specific protein , but that the outcome can not necessarily be extrapolated to other proteins.
