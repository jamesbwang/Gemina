 To fully exploit the microbial genome resources , a high-throughput experimental platform is needed to associate genes with phenotypes at the genome level. We present here a novel method that enables investigation of the cellular consequences of repressing individual transcripts based on the CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi) pooled screening in bacteria. We identify rules for guide RNA library design to handle the unique structure of prokaryotic genomes by tiling screening and construct an E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> genome-scale guide RNA library ( ~ 60,000 members) accordingly. We show that CRISPRi outperforms transposon sequencing , the benchmark method in the microbial functional genomics field , when similar library sizes are used or gene length is short. This tool is also effective for mapping phenotypes to non-coding RNAs ( ncRNAs) , as elucidated by a comprehensive tRNA-fitness map constructed here. Our results establish CRISPRi pooled screening as a powerful tool for mapping complex prokaryotic genetic networks in a precise and high-throughput manner.
