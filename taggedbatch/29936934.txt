 Ciliary beat frequency ( CBF) regulates the oviductal transport of oocytes and embryos , which are important components of the reproductive process. Local release of ATP transiently increases CBF by increasing ( Ca2 +) i. Ovarian hormones also regulate ciliary activity and oviductal transport. Progesterone ( P4) induces nitric oxide ( NO) production and high P4 concentrations induce ciliary dysfunction. However , the mechanism by which P4 affects CBF has not been elucidated. To evaluate the role of P4 in NO production and its effect on ATP-induced increases in CBF , we measured CBF , NO concentrations and ( Ca2 +) i in cultures of oviductal ciliated cells treated with P4 or NO signalling-related molecules. ATP induced a ( Ca2 +) i peak , followed by an increase in NO concentrations that were temporally correlated with the decreased phase of the transiently increased CBF. Furthermore , P4 increased the expression of nitric oxide synthases ( iNOS and nNOS) and reduced the ATP-induced increase in CBF via a mechanism that involves the NO signalling pathway. These results have improved our knowledge about intracellular messengers controlling CBF and showed that NO attenuates oviduct cell functions. Furthermore , we showed that P4 regulates neurotransmitter ( ATP) actions on CBF via the NO pathway , which could explain pathologies where oviductal transport is altered and fertility decreased.
