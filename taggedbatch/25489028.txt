 Adverse childhood experiences ( ACEs) including maltreatment and exposure to household stressors can impact the health of children. Community factors that provide support , friendship and opportunities for development may build children 's resilience and protect them against some harmful impacts of ACEs. We examine if a history of ACEs is associated with poor childhood health and school attendance and the extent to which such outcomes are counteracted by community resilience assets. A national ( Wales) cross-sectional retrospective survey ( n = 2452) using a stratified random probability sampling methodology and including a boost sample ( n = 471) of Welsh speakers. Data collection used face-to-face interviews at participants ' places of residence. Outcome measures were self-reported poor childhood health , specific conditions ( asthma , allergies , headaches<symptom> , digestive disorders) and school absenteeism. Prevalence of each common childhood condition , poor childhood health and school absenteeism increased with number of ACEs reported. Childhood community resilience assets ( being treated fairly , supportive childhood friends , being given opportunities to use your abilities , access to a trusted adult<disease> and having someone to look up to) were independently linked to better outcomes. In those with â‰¥ 4 ACEs the presence of all significant resilience assets ( vs none) reduced adjusted prevalence of poor childhood health from 59.8 to 21.3 %. Better prevention of ACEs through the combined actions of public services may reduce levels of common childhood conditions , improve school attendance and help alleviate pressures on public services. Whilst the eradication of ACEs remains unlikely , actions to strengthen community resilience assets may partially offset their immediate harms.
