 Plenty of plant extracts have been used for treating hair loss. This study aims to investigate the effects of liposterolic extracts of Serenoa repens<pathogen> ( LSESr) on hair cell growth and regeneration of hair , and clarify the associated mechanisms. Human keratinocyte cells ( HACAT) were cultured , incubated with dihydrotestosterone ( DHT) and treated with LSESr. Cell viability was examined by using 3- ( 4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl) -2,5-diphenyl-2-H- tetrazolium bromide ( MTT) assay. Hair loss C57BL/6 mouse model was established by inducing with DHT. Hair growth , density , and thickness were evaluated. Back skin samples were collected and stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( HE) assay. B-cell lymphoma-2 ( Bcl-2) , Bcl-2 associated protein X ( Bax) , cleaved caspase 3 and transforming growth factor β2 ( TGF-β2) were examined using Western blot assay. LSESr treatment significantly increased HACAT cell viabilities compared to DHT-only treated cells ( p < 0.05). LSESr treatment post injection of DHT significantly converted skin<symptom> color from pink to gray and increased hair density , weight and thickness compared to DHT-only treated mice ( p < 0.05). LSESr treatment significantly triggered follicle growth and decreased inflammatory response. LSESr treatment significantly decreased TGF-β2 and cleaved caspase 3 expression of hair loss mouse models compared to that of DHT treated mice ( p < 0.05). LSESr treatment significantly enhanced Bcl-2 expression and reduced Bax expression compared to that of DHT treated mice ( p < 0.05). Meanwhile , effects of LSESr were substantial even achieving to the potential of finasteride. LSESr promoted the hair regeneration and repair of hair loss mouse models by activating TGF-β signaling and mitochondrial signaling pathway.
