 In this work , silver nanowires ( AgNWs) printed on a polyethylene terephthalate substrate using a bar coater were welded via selective wavelength plasmonic flash light irradiation. To achieve high electrical conductivity and transparent characteristics , the wavelength of the flash white light was selectively chosen and irradiated by using high-pass , low-pass , and band-pass filters. The flash white light irradiation conditions such as on-time , off-time , and number of pulses were also optimized. The wavelength range ( 400-500 nm) corresponding to the plasmonic wavelength of the AgNW could efficiently weld the AgNW films and enhance its conductivity. To carry out in-depth study of the welding phenomena with respect to wavelength , a multiphysics COMSOL simulation was conducted. The welded AgNW films under selective plasmonic flash light welding conditions showed the lowest sheet resistance ( 51.275 Î©/sq) and noteworthy transmittance ( 95.3 %). Finally , the AgNW film , which was welded by selective wavelength plasmonic flash light with optical filters , was successfully used to make a large area transparent heat film and dye-sensitized solar cells showing superior performances.
