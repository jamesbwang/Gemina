 Symptomatic dilation of a spontaneous splenic artery dissection is a very rare and potentially catastrophic nonatherosclerotic vascular disease. Splenic artery rupture has not been reported after acute diffuse dilation , but it has been reported with celiac artery dissections. We believe treatment is mandatory if pain persists despite blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control. The presentation and endovascular treatment of a spontaneous celiac trunk dissection with continued expansion of the splenic artery branch are discussed.
