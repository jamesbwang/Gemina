 Mitophagy is one of the processes that cells use to maintain overall health. An E3 ligase , parkin , ubiquitinates mitochondrial proteins prior to their degradation by autophagasomes. USP30 is an enzyme that de-ubiquitinates mitochondrial proteins; therefore , inhibiting this enzyme could foster mitophagy. Herein , we disclose the structure-activity relationships ( SAR) within a novel series of highly selective USP30 inhibitors. Two structurally similar compounds , MF-094 ( a potent and selective USP30 inhibitor) and MF-095 ( a significantly less potent USP30 inhibitor) , serve as useful controls for biological evaluation. We show that MF-094 increases protein ubiquitination and accelerates mitophagy.
