 The RNA sequencing approach has been broadly used to provide gene- , pathway- , and network-centric analyses for various cell and tissue samples. However , thus far , rich cellular information carried in tissue samples has not been thoroughly characterized from RNA-Seq data. Therefore , it would expand our horizons to better understand the biological processes of the body by incorporating a cell-centric view of tissue transcriptome. Here , a computational model named seq-ImmuCC was developed to infer the relative proportions of 10 major immune cells in mouse tissues from RNA-Seq data. The performance of seq-ImmuCC was evaluated among multiple computational algorithms , transcriptional platforms , and simulated and experimental datasets. The test results showed its stable performance and superb consistency with experimental observations under different conditions. With seq-ImmuCC , we generated the comprehensive landscape of immune cell compositions in 27 normal mouse tissues and extracted the distinct signatures of immune cell proportion among various tissue types. Furthermore , we quantitatively characterized and compared 18 different types of mouse tumor tissues of distinct cell origins with their immune cell compositions , which provided a comprehensive and informative measurement for the immune microenvironment inside tumor tissues.
