 Toxoplasmosis<disease> in marine mammals is epidemiologically and clinically important. Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> antibodies ( by modified agglutination test , cut-off ≥ 1:25) were detected in serum of 65 of 70 ( 92.9 %) northern sea otters ( Enhydra lutris kenyoni) from Washington State , USA. Brains and/or muscles of 44 sea otters were bioassayed in mice ( INF-γ knock-out ( KO) , Swiss Webster outbred ( SW)) and viable T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> was isolated from 22 of 44 ( 50 %); T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> strains were lethal to KO mice but not SW mice. These T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> isolates were further propagated in cell culture. Multi-locus PCR-RFLP genotyping of cell culture-derived tachyzoites revealed four different genotypes among 22 isolates including ToxoDB PCR-RFLP genotype # 5 ( 14 isolates) , # 1 ( three isolates) , # 3 ( four isolates) , and # 167 ( one isolate). PCR-DNA sequencing based genotyping using polymorphic gene GRA6 revealed one of four different alleles. Among the 14 RFLP genotype # 5 strains , 10 have GRA6 sequences that match with the Type A , one match with the Type X , two strains did not generate sequence data , and one strain had double peaks at known polymorphic sites indicating a mixed<disease> infection<disease>. The seven strains belong to genotypes # 1 and # 3 , all have identical sequences to T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> Type II reference isolate ME49. Genotype # 167 strain has identical sequence to Type I reference strain. In summary , we observed high seroprevalence , and high rate of isolation of T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> from northern sea otters and predominant genotype # 5 that has been previously reported a dominant and widespread strain among terrestrial wildlife in North<pathogen> America. GRA6 sequence analysis of the genotype # 5 isolates indicated the dominance of Type A lineage in sea otters in Washington State.
