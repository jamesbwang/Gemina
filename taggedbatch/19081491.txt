 Four novel human gammapapillomaviruses were characterized from penile specimens using genome amplification , cloning , and sequencing. The HPV-219 L1 gene showed 87 % nucleotide identity to that of HPV-213 of species gamma-13 , HPV-220 had 72 % identity to L1 of HPV-212 ( gamma-17) , HPV-221 had 80 % identity to L1 of HPV-142 ( gamma-10) , and HPV-222 had 73 % nucleotide identity to L1 of HPV-162 ( gamma-19).
