 Only a few studies have addressed liver stiffness dynamics after hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> C<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) treatment in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection. The aim was to evaluate the variation in liver stiffness and in serum liver fibrosis<disease> scores in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients before and after treatment with direct-acting antivirals ( DAAs). Liver stiffness measured using transient elastography as well as serum liver fibrosis<disease> scores ( fibrosis-4 ( FIB-4) score and the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index ( APRI)) were evaluated before and at 6-12 months after DAA treatment. Variation in the outcome variables was evaluated using the Wilcoxon nonparametric test. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression models were used. A total of 78 HIV/HCV-coinfected subjects were included in the study. Median values of hepatic stiffness significantly decreased after DAA treatment compared with baseline ( 16.8 ( interquartile range ( IQR) 10.2-27.0) kPa at baseline vs. 9.4 ( IQR 6.7-15.0) kPa after DAA treatment; P < 0.01). Further , a decrease in median FIB-4 score ( 2.8 ( IQR 1.5-4.8) vs. 2.0 ( IQR 1.3-3.2) , respectively; P < 0.01) and APRI ( 0.9 ( IQR 0.5-2.2) vs. 0.4 ( IQR 0.2-0.7) , respectively; P < 0.01) was found. In univariate analysis , liver stiffness decrease was associated with increasing age , ` other ' HCV<pathogen> genotype ( vs. G1) , the presence of cirrhosis , higher pre-DAA liver stiffness , sofosbuvir-based regimens and longer DAA treatment ( all P < 0.05). Multivariate regression confirmed the significance of the association only with higher baseline liver stiffness ( P < 0.01). Greater FIB-4 and APRI reductions were associated with higher respective baseline values , while the presence of hepatic steatosis correlated with lower score reduction after DAA. A reduction in liver stiffness and an improvement in fibrosis<disease> scores were observed in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients soon after DAA treatment. The clinical implications of these observations need to be evaluated in larger populations with longer follow-up.
