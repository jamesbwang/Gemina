 To examine the efficacy and safety of induction therapy with paclitaxel and bevacizumab followed by switch maintenance therapy with eribulin ( ISMT) in Japanese patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer ( MBC). Patients , who had previously undergone a maximum of 2 regimens of chemotherapy , received 3 cycles of induction therapy with paclitaxel ( 90 mg/m Fifty-one eligible patients ( median age: 66 years; range: 35-74) were enrolled: 19 ( 37.3 %) and 32 ( 62.7 %) had stage IV and recurrence , respectively , 42 ( 82.4 %) had visceral metastases , and 45 ( 88.2 %) received eribulin-38 of whom showed disease progression , and 40 ( 78.4 %) underwent post therapy. Median TTF was 9.2 months ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 7.3-11.1) , median progression-free survival was 10.7 months ( 95 % CI: 9.6-11.8) , and median overall survival was 20.0 months ( 95 % CI: 16.0-24.0). Relative dose intensity was 97.7 % ( range: 33.3-100.0) for induction therapy and was 83.3 % ( range: 49.3-100.6 %) for eribulin maintenance therapy. The most common adverse event was alopecia ( 51 ( 100 %)) in induction therapy and was peripheral sensory neuropathy ( 37 ( 82.2 %)) in eribulin maintenance therapy. Eribulin was effective with manageable tolerability. ISMT may be a promising therapeutic option for patients with MBC. UMIN000015971. Registration date: January 1 , 2015.
