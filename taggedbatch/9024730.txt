 To evaluate the relationship of aortic low attenuation plaque volume ( LAPV) on multidetector computed tomography ( MDCT) with the abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> ( AAA) , the coronary arterial disease ( CAD , ≥ 50 % stenosis) , severe ( ≥ 90 % stenosis) CAD , hypertension , and long-term ( ≥ 10 years) hypertension. Curved planar reformations ( CPR) of three segments ( the ascending , the arch , and the upper descending aorta) of the thoracic aorta were generated with attenuation-dependent color codes to measure LAPV with 0 ~ 29 HU and total noncalcified plaque volume ( TNPV) with 0 ~ 150 HU in 95 patients. Correlation coefficients were employed to assess the impact of each LAPV and TNPV on AAA , CAD , severe CAD , hypertension , and long-term hypertension. Each Mean LAPV/cm and TNPV/cm was statistically greater in the aortic arch than the ascending (
