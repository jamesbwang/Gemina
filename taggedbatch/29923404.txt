 Thirty-three samples of proso millet ( Panicum miliaceum) with different countries of origin were screened for their pepsin digestibility after cooking to identify samples with high digestibility. The pepsin digestibility of all samples ranged from 26 % to 57 % ( average 32 %). There were no apparent differences in protein profiles ( by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , SDS-PAGE) of samples with the lowest , intermediate , and highest digestibilities. However , liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric ( LC-MS/MS) analysis revealed a negative correlation between pepsin digestibility and peptides that matched to high molecular weight proteins ( 24 kDa) from Panicum hallii with regions of contiguous hydrophobic amino acids. Low digestibility upon cooking was also observed for other species from the Panicum genus , such as little millet , switchgrass , and panicgrass , which suggests a unique inherent property of the genus. The results obtained from this study may form a basis for in-depth analysis of proso proteins that may help in developing new cultivars with higher digestibility upon cooking.
