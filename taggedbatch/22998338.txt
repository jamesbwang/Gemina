 This population-based study was designed to investigate whether consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages ( SSB) is associated with lower serum total testosterone concentration in men 20-39 years old. All data for this study were retrieved from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES) 2011-2012. The primary outcome was serum testosterone concentration , and main independent variable was SSB intake. Other variables included age , race/ethnicity , poverty/income ratio , body mass index ( BMI) , serum cotinine , heavy drinking , and physical activity. Among all subjects ( N = 545) , 486 ( 90.4 %) had normal testosterone levels ( defined as ≥ 231 ng/dL) and 59 ( 9.6 %) had low testosterone levels ( defined as < 231 ng/dL). Multivariate logistic regression revealed the odds of low testosterone was significantly greater with increasing SSB consumption ( Q4 ( ≥ 442 kcal/day) vs. Q1 ( ≤ 137 kcal/day)) , adjusted odds ratio ( aOR) = 2.29 , p = 0.041). After adjusting for possible confounding variables , BMI was an independent risk factor for low testosterone level; subjects with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m SSB consumption is significantly associated with low serum testosterone in men 20-39 years old in the United States.
