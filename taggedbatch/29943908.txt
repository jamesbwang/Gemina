 The development of de novo donor specific HLA antibody ( dnDSA) is a critical feature contributing to late allograft failure. The complexity of the issue is further complicated by organ specific differences , detection techniques , reliance of tissue histopathology and changing diagnostic criteria , ineffective therapies , and lack of consensus. To tackle these issues , the Sensitization in Transplantation Assessment of Risk ( STAR) 2017 was initiated as a collaboration of the American Society of Transplantation and American Society of Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics consisting of 8 working groups with the goal to provide guidelines on how to assess risk and risk stratify patients based on their potential alloimmune and DSA status. Herein is a summary of discussions by the Na√Øve Abdominal Working Group , highlighting currently available data and identifying gaps in our knowledge on the development and impact of dnDSA following kidney transplantation.
