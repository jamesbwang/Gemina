 Limited information exists on emergency department ( ED) visits for adolescent and young adult ( AYA) patients with cancer. We examined the clinical reasons for ED visits , and outcomes , for AYAs with cancer compared to pediatric cancer patients. The 2013 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample data were used to identify 53,274 AYA ( ages 15-39) and 6952 pediatric ( ages 0-14) cancer ED visits. We evaluated patient ( i.e. , demographic and diagnosis) and hospital characteristics , and the ED event outcome ( admitted to the same hospital or treated/released). Clinical reasons for visits were identified as procedures , infections , or noninfectious toxicities. Variables were compared between groups using chi-squared tests. Logistic regressions identified characteristics associated with the outcome between and within groups. AYA cancer visits were more likely to be self-paid ( 15.8 % vs. 1.9 % , p < 0.001) , and be from low-income households and nonmetro counties than pediatric visits. Toxicity was the most prevalent reason for AYA visits ( 46.0 %) and infections for pediatrics ( 47.3 % , p < 0.001). AYA cancer visits were less likely to be admitted ( OR = 0.84 , 95 % CI = 0.71-0.98; p = 0.03) than pediatric cancer. Among AYAs , self-paid visits were less likely to be admitted compared with privately insured visits ( OR = 0.58 , 95 % CI: 0.52-0.66 , p < 0.001). Self-pay did not affect the outcome for pediatric visits. In the United States , compared with pediatric cancer patients , AYAs with cancer visit EDs more often for toxicity-related problems , and are more often self-paid and from poorer households. These distinctive features impacting health service use should be incorporated into care plans aimed at delineating effective care for these patients.
