 Since its commercialization in the late 1980 's , confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM) has since become one of the most prevalent fluorescence microscopy techniques for three-dimensional structural studies of biological cells and tissues. The flexibility of the approach has enabled its application in a diverse array of studies , from the fast imaging of dynamic processes in living cells , to meticulous morphological analyses of tissues , and co-localization of protein expression patterns. In this chapter , we introduce the principles of confocal microscopy and discuss how the approach has become a mainstay in the biological sciences. We describe the components of a CLSM system and assess how modern implementations of the approach have further expanded the use of the technique. Finally , we briefly outline some practical considerations to take into account when acquiring data using a CLSM system. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
