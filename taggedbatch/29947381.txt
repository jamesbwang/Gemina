 This work seeks to apply symmetry-adapted perturbation theory ( SAPT) to the recent study of Hoveyda and co-workers ( K. A. Lee et al. , Nat. Chem. 2016 , 8 , 768) where an allyl addition to a ketone became enantioselective when the ketone was fluorinated. Through the application of atomic SAPT ( A-SAPT) and functional-group SAPT ( F-SAPT) , the non-covalent interactions between specific atoms and functional groups in the transition states associated with the fluoroketone reactions can be quantified. Our A-SAPT analysis confirms that a HF contact thought to enhance stereoselectivity shows a strong preference for one of the transition states leading to the experimentally observed product enantiomer. Other key atom-atom contacts invoked to rationalize relative transition state energies are also found to behave as expected based on chemical intuition and contact distances. On the other hand , hypothesized steric clashes between substrate phenyl or ortho-methyl phenyl groups and the catalyst are not supported by F-SAPT computations , and indeed , these are actually favorable π-π interactions.
