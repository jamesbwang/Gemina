 Large-vessel vasculitis ( LVV) is a serious illness with potentially life-threatening consequences. ( A retrospective database review for LVV patients undergoing CECT and PET-CT between 2011 to 2016 yielded demographics , scan interval and vasculitis type. Qualitative and quantitative PET-CT analyses included aorta: liver FDG uptake , bespoke FDG uptake distribution scores and vascular maximum standardised uptake values ( SUV 36 adults ( 17 LVV , 19 controls) with a mean age ( range) 63 ( 38-89) years , of which 17 ( 47 %) were males were included. Time interval between CT and PET was mean ( standard deviation ( SD)) 1.9 ( 1.2) months. Both SUV FDG PET-CT demonstrated excellent accuracy whilst CECT mural thickening showed good accuracy in the diagnosis of LVV. Both parameters showed a highly significant correlation. In hospitals without access to FDG PET-CT or in patients unsuitable for PET-CT ( e.g. uncontrolled diabetes) CECT offers a viable alternative for the assessment of LVV. Advances in knowledge: FDG PET-CT is a highly accurate test for the diagnosis of LVV. Aorta: liver SUV
