 To estimate the association between organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs) and multiple myeloma ( MM). The risk of MM from organochlorine compounds was examined in a population-based case-control study in British Columbia , Canada. Congeners of PCBs and pesticides or pesticide metabolites were measured in plasma of 325 cases and 327 controls. Most organochlorine analytes showed a significant association with MM. The strongest association ( highest vs lowest quartile) was oxychlordane ( OR = 7.44 95 % CI = 4.19-13.21). No heterogeneity was detected between organochlorines levels and MM subtypes. Only oxychlordane and β-hexachlorocyclohexane ( β-HCCH) were identified as significant independent predictors of MM. Our study provides evidence that organochlorines contribute to the risk of MM.
