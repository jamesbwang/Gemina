 This work presents a fault-tolerant ( FT) scheme based on the application of non-integer order observers also called fractional observers , the case of study is a double pipe countercurrent heat exchanger ( HE). The aim of the FT is to detect sensors faults as soon as possible , and to provide a healthy signal in order to replace the faulty sensor signal by the fractional observer estimation. To develop the FT scheme a bank of high gain fractional order observers ( HGFOO) is proposed. The Riemann-Liouville ( RL) fractional derivative definition is used to solve each fractional observer. Experimental measures from a HE were used to test the performance of the fractional observers and the control scheme. The results show the robustness of the proposed observers.
