 Even though chemically stable metal oxides ( MOs) , as substitutes for poly ( 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate ( PEDOT: PSS) , have been successfully adopted for improving device stability in solution-processed quantum dot light-emitting diodes ( QLEDs) , the efficiencies of QLEDs are at a relatively low level. In this work , a novel architecture of QLEDs has been introduced , in which inorganic/organic bilayer hole injection layers ( HILs) were delicately designed by inserting an amorphous WO
