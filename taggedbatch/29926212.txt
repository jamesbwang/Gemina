 Lateral mass screws combined with rods are the standard method for posterior cervical spine subaxial fixation. Several techniques have been described , among which the most used are Roy Camille , Magerl , Anderson and An. All of them are based on tridimensional angles. Reliability of freehand angle estimation remains poorly investigated. We propose a new technique based on on-site spatial references and compare it with previously described ones assessing screw length and neurovascular potential complications. Four different lateral mass screw insertion techniques ( Magerl , Anderson , An and the new described technique) were performed bilaterally , from C3 to C6 , in ten human spine specimens. A drill tip guide wire was inserted as originally described for each trajectory , and screw length was measured. Exit point was examined , and potential vertebral artery or nerve root injury was assessed. Mean screw length was 14.05 mm using Magerl 's technique , 13.47 mm using Anderson 's , 12.8 mm using An 's and 17.03 mm using the new technique. Data analysis showed significantly longer lateral mass screw length using the new technique ( p value < 0.00001). Nerve potential injury occurred 37 times using Magerl 's technique , 28 using Anderson 's , 13 using An 's and twice using the new technique. Vertebral artery potential injury occurred once using Magerl 's technique , 8 times using Anderson 's and none using either An 's or the new proposed technique. The risk of neurovascular complication was significantly lower using the new technique ( p value < 0.01). The new proposed technique allows for longer screws , maximizing purchase and stability , while lowering the complication rate.
