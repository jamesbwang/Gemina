 Malunion is a common complication of distal radius fractures , especially those treated conservatively. In clinical studies , a significant correlation between anatomic reduction and wrist function has been shown. Corrective osteotomy is the preferred treatment for symptomatic cases , notwithstanding the technical challenges. The use of computer simulation improves pre-operative understanding of the three-dimensional deformity. Patient-specific surgical guides , based on precise pre-operative planning , lead to superior perioperative accuracy and reproducibility. The pre-operative planning and surgical technique of distal radius corrective surgery using three-dimensional computer technology are described in detail. The preliminary results demonstrate the excellent clinical and radiographic outcome of this technique.
