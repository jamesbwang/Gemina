 Chronic inflammation<symptom> and immunosuppression lead to aging and tumorigenesis. T-helper 22 ( Th22) cells , interleukin 22 ( IL-22) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs) serve an important role in inflammatory-immune diseases and cancer. However , the status of Th22 cells , IL-22 and MDSCs in aging and elderly gastric cancer progression is unknown. In the present study , 39 elderly patients with gastric cancer ( EGC) , 32 elderly healthy controls ( HE) and 31 young healthy controls ( HY) were enrolled , and the peripheral Th22 , Th17 and Th1 cells , and MDSCs , were examined using flow cytometry. Plasma levels of IL-22 , IL-6 and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) were examined using ELISA. IL-22 protein levels in tumor tissues were examined using immunohistochemistry. There were increased numbers of peripheral Th22 and Th17 cells , and MDSCs , as well as increased plasma levels of IL-22 , IL-6 and TNF-α in EGC compared with HE and HY. However , HE exhibited significantly increased levels of peripheral Th22 and Th17 cells as well as IL-6 and TNF-α compared with HY. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that IL-22 protein accumulated in tumor cells and lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment. The results obtained demonstrated that peripheral Th22 and Th17 cells as well as IL-6 and TNF-α plasma levels increased with aging. Furthermore , Th22 and Th17 cells , MDSCs , and IL-22 may be used as prognostic markers for identifying gastric cancer in elderly patients.
