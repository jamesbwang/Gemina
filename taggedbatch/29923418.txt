 To characterize differences in the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of laryngomalacia in patients with and without craniosynostosis. A retrospective cohort study was performed comparing all patients with concomitant laryngomalacia and craniosynostosis seen at a tertiary care children 's hospital between 2000 and 2016 with a control group of patients with isolated laryngomalacia. Thirty-two patients with craniosynostosis ( 59 % male) and 68 control patients ( 56 % male) were included. There were no significant differences in age of diagnosis or incidence of prematurity. Symptom presentation , disease severity , swallowing function , comorbidities , treatment modalities , and outcomes were examined using logistic regression. Patients with craniosynostosis had increased odds of presenting with stertor ( odds ratio ( OR) = 3.41 , P = .022) , increased work of breathing ( OR = 18.8 , P = .007) , obstructive sleep apnea ( OR = 8.48 , P = .003) , dysphagia<symptom> ( OR = 3.40 , P = .008) , and aspiration ( OR = 40.2 , P < .001) and decreased odds of presenting with stridor ( OR = 0.0804 , P < .001) compared with controls. Patients with craniosynostosis had increased odds of severe laryngomalacia ( OR = 5.00 , P = .031) and other airway anomalies such as tracheomalacia ( OR = 5.73 , P = .004) , bronchomalacia ( OR = 15.5 , P = .013) , and subglottic stenosis ( OR = 2.75 , P = .028). Treatment of patients with craniosynostosis was more likely to include tracheostomy ( OR = 24.8 , P < .001) and gastrostomy tube ( OR = 88.4 , P < .001). There were no significant differences in rates of supraglottoplasty. Clinical presentations , comorbidities , and treatments of laryngomalacia are significantly different in the context of craniosynostosis.
