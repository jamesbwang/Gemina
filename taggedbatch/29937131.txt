 A complete discoid lateral meniscus ( DLM) has a high risk of horizontal tear. However , cellular phenotypes and extracellular matrix organizations in complete DLMs are still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate histological and cellular biological characteristics in both the intercondylar and central regions of complete DLM. Meniscal samples were obtained from the intercondylar and central regions of complete DLM ( n = 6). Blood vessels and aggregated cell ratio were measured in each region. Depositions of type I/II collagens and safranin O-stained proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix were assessed. Experiments in gene expression , morphology , proliferation , and effect of mechanical stretch were performed using cultured cells derived from each region. Blood vessel counts were significantly higher in the intercondylar region than in the central region. The ratio of aggregated cells was lower in the intercondylar region than in the central region. Deposition of type I collagen was comparable for both regions. The central region contained a larger quantity of type II collagen and safranin O staining density compared with the intercondylar region. Proliferation of the fibroblastic intercondylar cells was not affected by 5 %- stretching. However , stretching treatments decreased relative proliferation of the chondrocytic central cells. This study demonstrated that the central region of complete DLM had different cellular properties and collagen components compared with the intercondylar region. Our results suggest that the central region of complete DLM may have a low healing potential like the inner avascular region of the meniscus.
