 Numerous instruments are available to measure the impact of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> , yet most have been developed with little or no patient involvement. This study seeks to start bridging that gap by determining which health aspects or attributes ( to be included in a future instrument) are considered most important by people with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. The goal of this study was to reveal which attributes reflecting impact of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> are considered most important by people with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> and to analyze differences in importance according to gender , age categories , diagnostic subgroups , and pain intensity categories. This study used a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design: literature search , focus group meetings , and online survey. First , a literature search was performed to identify the attributes in existing instruments. In 68 instruments meeting inclusion criteria , 155 unique attributes were identified , 85 of which remained after applying the exclusion criteria. Second , 2 focus group meetings , with 6 and 4 patients , respectively , were held to verify that no attributes had been missed. Three attributes were subsequently added. Third , individuals with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> were then sent an online survey through several patient organizations. A total of 939 patients were asked to select the 8 attributes they deemed most important , which resulted in the following list: fatigue<symptom> , social life , cramped muscles , sleeping , housekeeping , concentration , not being understood , and control over pain. The importance assigned to these 8 attributes varied slightly according to age , gender , and diagnostic subgroup. Participation rate could not be established because of the online survey. Attributes reflecting impact of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> deemed most important by patients are revealed. Importance of impact differs according to subgroups. The `` patients-first '' methodology used here revealed attributes that were not comprehensively covered in currently available instruments for measuring the impact of chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>.
