 The complement C1q/TNF related protein ( CTRP) family is rapidly growing and currently comprises 15 members. Although CTRP proteins share a common structure composed of four distinct domains: a signal peptide at the N terminus , a short variable region , a collagenous domain , and a C-terminal globular domain , which is homologous to adiponectin , each CTRP has a unique tissue expression profile and varied function. In this review we focus on the biochemistry and pleiotropic functions of CTRPs as new molecular mediators regulating cardiovascular metabolic disorders and its related risk factors diseases.
