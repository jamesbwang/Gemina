 Optical imaging techniques for biofilm observation , like laser scanning microscopy , are not applicable when investigating biofilm formation in opaque porous media. X-ray micro-tomography ( X-ray CMT) might be an alternative but it finds limitations in similarity of X-ray absorption coefficients for the biofilm and aqueous phases. To overcome this difficulty , barium sulphate was used in Davit et al. ( 2011) to enable high-resolution 3D imaging of biofilm via X-ray CMT. However , this approach lacks comparison with well-established imaging methods , which are known to capture the fine structures of biofilms , as well as uncertainty quantification. Here , we compare two-photon laser scanning microscopy ( TPLSM) images of Pseudomonas<pathogen> Aeruginosa biofilm grown in glass capillaries against X-ray CMT using an improved protocol where barium sulphate is combined with low-gelling temperature agarose to avoid sedimentation. Calibrated phantoms consisting of mono-dispersed fluorescent and X-ray absorbent beads were used to evaluate the uncertainty associated with our protocol along with three different segmentation techniques , namely hysteresis , watershed and region growing , to determine the bias relative to image binarization. Metrics such as volume , 3D surface area and thickness were measured and comparison of both imaging modalities shows that X-ray CMT of biofilm using our protocol yields an accuracy that is comparable and even better in certain respects than TPLSM , even in a nonporous system that is largely favourable to TPLSM.
