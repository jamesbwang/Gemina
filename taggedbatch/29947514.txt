 The extracellular domains ( ECDs) of Cys-loop receptors contain many aromatic amino acids , but only relatively few have been well studied. Here we explore the roles of Tyr and Trp residues in the ECD of the glycine receptor and show that four such residues that have not been previously studied ( Y24 , Y58 , W170 , and Y197) contribute significantly to the function of the protein. The residues were studied by creating mutant receptors , characterizing them using two-electrode voltage clamp in Xenopus oocytes , and interpreting changes in receptor parameters using structural information about the open and closed states of the receptor. Alanine substitution of all these residues ablates function or increases the glycine EC
