 Oral submucous fibrosis<disease> ( OSF) could have a significant impact on daily life activities of affected individuals. The objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of OSF on oral health-related quality of life ( OHRQoL). A total of 206 clinically diagnosed OSF patients were recruited and subjected to the condition-specific OHRQoL-OSF instrument and global self-ratings of oral health and overall well-being. `` Discomfort and functional impairment '' dimension was highly prevalent among patients with all stages ( p < 0.001). OSF also has impacts on other domains , namely `` psychological wellness '' ( 82.35 %) and `` social wellness '' ( 61.16 %). Stage IV OSF ( 25.94 ± 4.05) patients reported higher OHRQoL-OSF scores as compared to stage III ( 16.20 ± 2.58) and stage II OSF ( 7.26 ± 1.70) patients. However , stage I OSF patients reported significantly better OHRQoL ( p < 0.001). A significant trend demonstrating overall OHRQoL-OSF scores increasing with advancing stages of OSF was observed. The majority of the participants rated their overall oral health status `` fair '' ( 34.95 %) to `` very poor '' ( 26.21 %) , whereas overall well-being was rated as moderate ( 33.00 %) to good ( 31.55 %). OSF has a significant impact on OHRQoL. Increasing severity of OSF is associated with the worsening QoL.
