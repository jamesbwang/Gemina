 To determine the efficacy and safety of transabdominal direct sac puncture embolization of type II endoleaks after endovascular abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> repair ( EVAR). This retrospective review included 30 patients ( 4 women , 26 men; mean age = 79.1 years) who underwent 33 transabdominal direct sac puncture embolization procedures for type II endoleaks after EVAR. Embolization agents included cyanoacrylate glue only ( 45.5 %) , glue/coils ( 36.4 %) , and Onyx with or without glue/coils ( 18.1 %). Technical success was defined as complete endoleak embolization on intraprocedural fluoroscopy. The primary outcome was freedom of aneurysm<disease> growth , which was defined as ≤ 5 % aneurysm<disease> sac volume change on follow-up computed tomography ( CT) imaging or ≤ 5 mm aneurysm<disease> sac diameter change on ultrasound without definite endoflow. Aneurysm<disease> sac volumes before and after embolization were manually segmented from CT images. The procedural complication rate was calculated. Technical success was achieved in 97 % of patients ( 29/30). Follow-up imaging was available in 27 patients ( 25 CT; 2 ultrasound) , and mean imaging follow-up duration was 15.5 months. Freedom of aneurysm<disease> growth was achieved in 85.2 % of patients ( 23/27) after 1 or more embolization procedures. Median fluoroscopic and procedure times were 11.3 minutes and 90 minutes , respectively. The complication rate was 9.1 % ( 3/33) and included 1 case of nontarget embolization with transient neuropraxia and 2 self-limiting rectus<pathogen> sheath hematomas relating to the percutaneous puncture site. No aneurysm-related mortality occurred during the follow-up period. Percutaneous transabdominal embolization is a safe and efficacious treatment for type II endoleak , with a short procedure time.
