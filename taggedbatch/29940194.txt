 The experience of our body as our own ( i.e. body ownership) involves integrating different sensory signals according to their contextual relevance ( i.e. multisensory integration). Until recently , most studies of multisensory integration and body ownership concerned only vision , touch and proprioception<symptom>; the role of other modalities , such as the vestibular system and interoception , has been neglected and remains poorly understood. In particular , no study to date has directly explored the combined effect of vestibular and interoceptive signals on body ownership. Here , we investigated for the first time how Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation ( left , right , sham) , tactile affectivity ( a reclassified interoceptive modality manipulated by applying touch at C-tactile optimal versus non-optimal velocities) , and their combination , influence proprioceptive and subjective measures of body ownership during a rubber hand illusion paradigm with healthy participants ( N = 26). Our results show that vestibular stimulation ( left GVS) significantly increased proprioceptive drift towards the rubber hand during mere visual exposure to the rubber hand. Moreover , it also enhanced participants ' proprioceptive drift towards the rubber hand during manipulations of synchronicity and affective touch. These findings suggest that the vestibular system influences multisensory integration , possibly by re-weighting both the two-way relationship between proprioception<symptom> and vision , as well as the three-way relationship between proprioception<symptom> , vision and affective touch. We discuss these findings in relation to current predictive coding models of multisensory integration and body ownership.
