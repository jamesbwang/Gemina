 Thermoelectric ( TE) energy conversion with nontraditional organic materials is promising in wearable electronics and roll-to-roll manufacturing because of mechanical flexibility , lightweight , and easy processing. Although typical organic materials have a benefit of low thermal conductivity that creates a large temperature gradient , relatively small thermopower ( or Seebeck coefficient) often requires copious number of TE legs<symptom> to fabricate practical TE devices. Here , we show that hybrids of poly ( 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)- tosylate ( PEDOT-Tos) and carbon nanotubes ( CNTs) can produce extremely large thermopower , ∼ 14 mV/K at room temperature by a chemical reduction. With decent electrical conductivity , an extraordinary power factor of ∼ 1200 μW/m K
