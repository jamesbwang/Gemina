 In the current study the collagen , texture , and sensory characteristics of meat from 712 yearling males of 10 local Spanish and French beef breeds raised in their typical production systems were described. The breed-production system affected collagen and texture variables but affected sensory variables only slightly. There was a large amount of intra breed-production system variation for all the variables. French breeds had lower values for collagen solubility ( ~ 12 %) than Spanish breeds ( ~ 40 %). Stress ( WB) varied from 36 N/cm To differentiate a product in the market , it is necessary to define its characteristics. Differentiation allows increasing the added value of products and , therefore , income of the farmers. In addition , it guarantees to the consumers that the product they purchase has the intrinsic and extrinsic quality features that they seek. For consumers , beef texture is one of the most important quality attributes sought , therefore , studying factors that can affect beef texture is a major interest for the industry.
