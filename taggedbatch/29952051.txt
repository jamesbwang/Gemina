 The synthesis of a highly twisted chrysene derivative incorporating two electron deficient o-carboranyl groups is reported. The molecule exhibits a complex , excitation-dependent photoluminescence , including aggregation-induced emission ( AIE) with good quantum efficiency and an exceptionally long singlet excited state lifetime. Through a combination of detailed optical studies and theoretical calculations , the excited state species are identified , including an unusual excimer induced by the presence of o-carborane. This is the first time that o-carborane has been shown to induce excimer formation ab initio , as well as the first observation of excimer emission by a chrysene-based small molecule in solution. Bis-o-carboranyl chrysene is thus an initial member of a new family of o-carboranyl phenacenes exhibiting a novel architecture for highly-efficient multi-luminescent fluorophores.
