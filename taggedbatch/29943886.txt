 Low serum chloride is common in patients with chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( CHF) and is associated with worse outcomes. We investigated the clinical and prognostic associations , including cause of death associations , of low serum chloride in patients referred to a secondary care clinic with suspected heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Patients with echocardiogram and serum chloride were evaluated ( n = 5613). CHF was defined as signs and symptoms of the disease and either left ventricular systolic dysfunction ( LVSD) worse than mild ( heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF)) or LVSD mild or better and raised amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP) levels ( > 125 ng/L) ( heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF)). Hypochloraemia was defined as greater than two standard deviations below the mean in the local normal distribution ( < 96 mmol/L). Of the 5613 patients referred , 908 patients did not have CHF , 1988 had HFrEF , and 2717 had HFpEF. Compared to patients in the fourth quartile ( median chloride 106 mmol/L) , patients in the first quartile ( median chloride 96 mmol/L) had more severe<symptom> symptoms<symptom> ( 38 % New<pathogen> York Heart Association class III or IV vs. 25 % , P < 0.001) and were more likely to take loop diuretics ( 79 % vs. 55 % , P < 0.001). The annual mortality rate for patients with CHF was 11 %. Hypochloraemia was associated with an increased risk of death independent of NT-proBNP. Patients in the first quartile had a two-fold increased risk of death compared to patients in the fourth quartile ( P < 0.001). Sudden death was a common mode of death amongst patients with hypochloraemia. Hypochloraemia is strongly related to an adverse prognosis and may be a therapeutic target in patients with CHF.
