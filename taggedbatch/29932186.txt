 Glutathione ( GSH) , whose thiol group dictates its redox chemistry , is oxidized to the thiyl radical ( GS˙) , which rapidly dimerizes to GSSG. Previously , we found that the oxidation rate of GSH by IrCl62- depends on the base ( B) concentration and the pKa of its conjugate acid BH + , so that collateral to a stepwise mechanism , the concerted pathway GSH + IrCl62- + B = GS˙ + IrCl63- + BH + was proposed as the rate determining step. Herein , this investigation is extended to include oxidant-base pairs that render exothermic and endothermic conditions of ΔG ° ' for electron transfer ( ET) and proton transfer ( PT). Experiments were conducted by the reaction of GSH with an electrogenerated oxidant M + and using digital simulations to infer the mechanism. Data analysis shows that despite parallel mechanisms , the concerted one seems to predominate for the oxidant-base pair that renders the most isoenergetic coupled state , whereby a PT with is capable of producing an ET with , as a result of the Nernstian shift of with pKa. In contrast , the stepwise PT-ET appears to dominate when GS- grows in stability as becomes more negative. Understanding the interplay between ET and PT will help in the design of catalysts for energy harvesting processes that rely on proton-coupled electron transfer.
