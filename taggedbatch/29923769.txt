 In anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis ( AAV) , toll like receptors ( TLRs) may be engaged by infection associated patterns and by endogenous danger signals , linking infection and innate inflammation<symptom> with this autoimmune disease. This study examined intrarenal TLR2 , TLR4 and TLR9 expression and renal injury in AAV , testing the hypothesis that increased TLR expression correlates with renal injury. Patients with AAV exhibited both glomerular and tubulointerstitial expression of TLR2 , TLR4 and TLR9 , with TLR4 being the most prominent in both compartments. Glomerular TLR4 expression correlated with glomerular segmental necrosis<symptom> and cellular crescents , with TLR2 expression correlating with glomerular segmental necrosis<symptom>. The extent and intensity of glomerular and tubulointerstitial TLR4 expression , and the intensity of glomerular TLR2 expression inversely correlated with the presenting eGFR. While myeloid cells within the kidney expressed TLR2 , TLR4 and TLR9 , TLR2 and TLR4 co-localized with endothelial cells and podocytes , whereas TLR9 was expressed predominantly by podocytes. The functional relevance of intrarenal TLR expression was further supported by the co-localization of TLRs with their endogenous ligands high mobility group box 1 and fibrinogen. Therefore , in AAV , the extent of intrarenal TLR4 and TLR2 expression and their correlation with renal injury indicates that TLR4 , and to a lesser degree TLR2 , may be potential therapeutic targets in this disease.
