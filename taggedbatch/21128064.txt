 Gastric cancer with Laur√®n diffuse types is increasing in the West<disease>. The raising trend is more evident when considering signet ring cells ( SRC) histology. However , to control the biologic potential of this GC subtype , some hypotheses of tailored therapeutic strategies for SRC cancers have been made. A review of the literature was performed using the key words `` signet ring cells '' AND `` gastric cancer ''. Results of literature review were descriptively reported. Endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD) , according to the Japanese extended criteria , could be a therapeutic option for early SRC tumours. However , according to the evidences from more recent studies , indications for ESD to these tumours types should be carefully considered. Concerning the optimal surgical treatment , considering the high lymphotropism and infiltrating behaviour of SRC histotype , the extension of gastric resection should be wider than for intestinal type cancer and laparoscopic surgery should be performed carefully. Moreover , D3 lymphadenectomy could provide a benefit in diffuse-type and SRC histology. The role of surgery in gastric cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis is still debated and studies on this topic should stratify the good results according to GC histotype. Finally , despite the evidences of chemoresistance in SRC , ongoing randomized trials suggest that multimodal therapy could be the best treatment. Based on the assumption that SRC tumours have specific features , they deserve a specific multimodal treatment. However , a preliminary step to generate strong evidences in this field is the standardization of terminology used to define signet ring cells carcinoma.
