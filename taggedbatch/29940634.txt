 Premalignant oral lesions<symptom> are among the most important risk factors for the development of oral squamocellular carcinoma. Recent population studies indicate a significant rise in the prevalence of leukoplakia , erythroplakia/erythroleukoplakia , actinic cheilitis , submucous fibrosis<disease> and erosive lichen planus. Since standard histopathological examination has numerous limitations regarding the accurate appreciation of potential malignant transformation , the present study aims to aid these evaluations using the transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) technique , which emphasizes ultrastructural changes pertaining to this pathology. Oral mucosa fragments collected from 43 patients that were clinically and histopathologically diagnosed with leukoplakia , erosive actinic cheilitis and erosive lichen planus have been processed through the classic technique for the examination using TEM and were examined using a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope. The electron microscopy study has confirmed the histopathological diagnosis of the tissue samples examined using photonic microscopy and has furthermore revealed a series of ultrastructural details that on the one hand indicate the tendency for malignant transformation , and on the other reveal characteristic features of tumor development. All the details furnished by TEM complete the overall picture of morphological changes , specific to these lesions<symptom> , indicating the importance of using these techniques in establishing both a correct diagnosis and prognosis.
