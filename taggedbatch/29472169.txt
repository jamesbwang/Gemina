 Nodular hidradenoma ( NH) is a benign adnexal tumor that arises from either eccrine or apocrine sweat<symptom> glands. NH can originate from any cutaneous site , but the most common sites are the head and anterior surface of the trunk , with very rare cases in the extremities. Long-standing NH has been reported to undergo malignant transformation to malignant NH ( MNH); however , its occurrence in the lower leg is extremely rare with only one other case reported to date. In this report , we present a rare case of MNH occurring in the lower leg which was resected with the intent to make a diagnosis. At the final follow-up after 11 months , no local recurrence or metastasis has been observed.
