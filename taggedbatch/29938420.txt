 Preterm delivery ( before 37 completed weeks of gestation) is a major determinant of infant mortality. The objective of study was to determine the efficacy of 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone in preventing delivery before 37 weeks of gestation in high risk women. This study , a randomized controlled trial was conducted in Obstetrics OPD , observing all scientific and ethical protocols. The women with less than 20 weeks gestation and with a past history of preterm delivery were included. A total of 132 women fulfilled the study requirements. Two groups made were as follows: Group A ( Treatment group received intramuscular 17-alpha hydroxy-progesterone) and Group B served as control ( The control group revived intramuscular Neurobion). A total of 66 women were assigned to each group. The data was recorded on a specially designed proforma for statistical analysis and comparison following the standard procedure. The criterion was strictly observed. The results showed a statistically significant ( p < 0.01) difference between group A as compared to group B. 17-Î±- Hydroxyprogesterone was found to be an effective drug in preventing delivery before 37 weeks in women at risk.
