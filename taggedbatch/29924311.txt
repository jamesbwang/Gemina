 Sore<symptom> throat<symptom> is a frequent presentation of acute<pathogen><disease><symptom> respiratory<disease><symptom> tract<symptom><disease> infections<disease> in general practice. Though these infections are often harmless and self-limiting , antibiotics are frequently prescribed. In Denmark , practice nurses manage an increasing part of patients with acute minor illnesses. We aimed ( i) to investigate Danish practice nurses ' and GPs ' management of patients presenting with a sore<symptom> throat<symptom> and ( ii) to explore to what extent management is according to current Danish guidelines. A cross-sectional study was conducted during winter 2017 , involving GPs and practice nurses in Danish general practices. Patients with a sore<symptom> throat<symptom> were registered according to the Audit Project Odense method. A total of 44 practices participated with the registration of 1503 patients presenting with a sore<symptom> throat<symptom>. Most patients had a strep A test performed , especially when managed by a practice nurse ( 84.6 % versus 61.8 % , χ2 = 90.1 , P < 0.05). In total , 40.6 % of performed strep A tests were not according to guideline recommendations. Antibiotics were prescribed for about one-third of patients , regardless whether managed by a practice nurse or a GP ( χ2 = 0.33 , P = 0.57). However , 32.4 % of these prescriptions were not in line with Danish guidelines. Patients with acute sore<symptom> throat<symptom> were managed similarly by GPs and practice nurses , apart from a higher use of strep A tests in patients seen by practice nurses. Importantly , this study demonstrated that there is still room for improvement of the management of these patients in Danish general practice.
