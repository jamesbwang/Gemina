 WHIM ( warts<disease> , hypogammaglobulinemia , infections , and myelokathexis) syndrome<pathogen><disease><symptom> is a genetic autoimmune disorder that results from gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding chemokine receptor CXCR4. A previous study characterized a patient with WHIM who underwent a chromothriptic event that resulted in spontaneous deletion of the WHIM allele in a single hematopoietic stem cell and subsequent cure of the disease. In this issue of the JCI , Gao et al. extend this work and show that Cxcl4-haplosufficient bone<disease> marrow has a selective advantage for long-term engraftment in murine WHIM models. Moreover , successful engraftment occurred without prior conditioning of recipients. Together , these results have important implications for improving hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell transplant not only for patients with WHIM but also for all patients who may require the procedure.
