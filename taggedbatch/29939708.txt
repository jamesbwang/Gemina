 Free-standing , high aspect ratio sulfur-doped carbon nanodots-based hybrid nanowires with a microtubular aspect were synthesized using self-recognition and self-assembly processes of tubulin , a biological molecule precursor of the cytoskeletal cellular and structural filaments. Physico-chemical characterizations ( e.g. , morphology , diameter , spectra absorbance etc.) of the user-synthesized hybrid bio-nanowires were performed using classical atomic and spectroscopic techniques , while bioactivity testing was demonstrated by mimicking cellular transport based on kinesin , a motor protein capable to recognize , bind onto and move onto cytoskeletal filaments. Our results indicate that user-synthesized hybrid nanowires could be manipulated in vitro under constant chemical energy of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP) and have the potential to be implemented in the next generation of synthetic applications from drug delivery to diagnosis systems , and photocatalytic to optical devices.
