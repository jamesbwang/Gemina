 The mean square error ( MSE) of a lagged ensemble of monthly forecasts of the Ni√±o 3.4 index from the Climate Forecast System ( CFSv2) is examined with respect to ensemble size and configuration. Although the real-time forecast is initialized 4 times per day , it is possible to infer the MSE for arbitrary initialization frequency and for burst ensembles by fitting error covariances to a parametric model and then extrapolating to arbitrary ensemble size and initialization frequency. Applying this method to real-time forecasts , we find that the MSE consistently reaches a minimum for a lagged ensemble size between one and eight days , when four initializations per day are included. This ensemble size is consistent with the 8-10 day lagged ensemble configuration used operationally. Interestingly , the skill of both ensemble configurations is close to the estimated skill of the infinite ensemble. The skill of the weighted , lagged , and burst ensembles are found to be comparable. Certain unphysical features of the estimated error growth were tracked down to problems with the climatology and data discontinuities.
