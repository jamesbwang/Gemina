 The Matilda effect illustrates how the contributions of women to science have been historically attributed to their male colleagues in some circumstances. This effect may perpetuate and even increase the gender gap we currently face. Recognizing the work of great women who led our way and committed their careers to transform society can offer the gender-positive role models required to speed up the movement toward gender equity in science. As a way to overcome the Matilda effect and begin to acknowledge the contributions of outstanding women scientists , I propose to embrace the Mathilde Krim effect , and commemorate how the will of a woman had such a profound impact on the fight against HIV<pathogen> and AIDS.
