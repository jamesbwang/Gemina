 The current investigation was conducted on gres porcelain stoneware , a robust , impermeable and aesthetically pleasing type of ceramic mainly used for flooring , characterizing its resistance to bending and low-velocity impact , both representative efforts to which flooring tiles are constantly subjected as a consequence of the fall of objects and microsubsidences. The mechanical characterization was made through experimental tests following an adapted low-velocity impact testing routine , and the model was by validated numerical simulation through the explicit code software LS-DYNA based on the Johnson ‚Åª Holmquist constitutive material model. Specimens were tested before and after an annealing cycle industrially used to allow porcelain folding. The thermal treatment demonstrated to infer a decrease in mechanical resistance on the material , understood as a consequence of its elevated maximum temperature and fast cooling rate. The numerical model calibrated successfully allows predicting the behavior of gres porcelain before and after annealing against low-velocity impact.
