 `` Quadrella '' index has been recently developed to assess oncological and functional outcomes after prostate brachytherapy ( PB). We aimed to evaluate this index at 1 , 2 , and 3 years , using validated questionnaires , assessed prospectively. From 08/2007 to 01/2013 , 193 patients underwent At 12 months , 90 patients were evaluable: 42/90 ( 46.7 %) achieved Quadrella. The main criteria for failure were as follows: ED in 77.1 % ( 37/48) of cases , RT in 20.8 % ( 10/48) of cases , and UT in 12.5 % ( 9/57) of cases. At 24 and 36 months , 59.3 % ( 48/81) and 61.1 % ( 44/72) of patients achieved Quadrella , respectively. The main cause of failure was ED in 69.7 % ( 23/33) and 85.7 % ( 24/28) of cases , while RT was involved in 21.2 % ( 7/33) and in 3.6 % ( 1/28) of cases , and UT in 9.1 % ( 3/33) and 3.6 % ( 1/28) of cases. Only one case of biochemical recurrence was observed ( i.e. , 1/28 = 3.6 % at 3 y). The Quadrella can be used at 1 , 2 , and 3 years after PB. It allows to take into account the urinary and RT specific to PB. ED was the main cause of failure. This index will be useful to assess midterm and long-term results.
