 Manganese dioxide magnetic nanoparticle ( MnO2-NP) with specific size range from 30 to 60 nm has widespread application in magnetic resonance imaging , medicine and drug delivery in exposed humans and animals. Manganese nanoparticles could affect hippocampus tissue and impose abnormal cognitive functions such as manganese ion. Therefore , to investigate whether MnO2-NP is damaging hippocampus tissue and inducing molecular and neurobehavioral abnormalities , we administrated different doses of synthesized nanoparticle to rats and measured behavioral , biochemical and histological parameters by standard methods. Results showed that the treatment of rats with MnO2-NP during 15 days induced oxidative stress and reduced catecholamine content in hippocampus tissue. MnO2-NP affected hippocampus tissue appearance by increasing the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells suggested that approved nanoparticle penetrated blood brain barrier and reached the hippocampal cells. Interestingly , all biochemical and histological effects of MnO2-NP were dose dependent. By considering that hippocampus plays an important role in cognitive function , behavioral abnormalities in intoxicated rats were predictable and nanoparticle administrated rats showed depression<symptom> like behavioral signs dose dependently. Based on our results and previous studies that confirmed neurotoxicity of MnO2-NP in Âµg dose rang , the application of this nanoparticles should be limited and their waste should be neutralized before their release to the environment ( Fig. 4 , Ref. 31).
