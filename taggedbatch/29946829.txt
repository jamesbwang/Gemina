 The impact of estradiol-based hormone therapy ( HT) on the incidence of stress urinary incontinence ( SUI) is unknown. Therefore , we compared the use of such HT regimens and tibolone in women with and without SUI. The women with a history of SUI operation ( N = 15,002) were identified from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Register , and the control women without such an operation ( N = 44,389) from the Finnish Central Population Register. The use of HT was traced from the National Drug Reimbursement Register , and the odd ratios ( ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CIs) for SUI were calculated by using the conditional logistic regression analysis. The cases had used any HT more often than the controls. The use of systemic estradiol-only or estradiol-progestin therapy was accompanied by an increased SUI risk ( OR 3.8 , 95 % CI: 3.6-4.0 and OR 2.7 , 95 % CI: 2.6-2.9 respectively). The use of estradiol with noretisterone acetate showed a higher risk of increase than that with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Age over 55 years at the initiation of systemic HT was accompanied by a higher SUI risk increase than that under 55 years of age. The use of tibolone , an estradiol + levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device , or vaginal estradiol also increased the risk. The use of HT regimens may predispose to the de novo development or worsening of pre-existing SUI. Thus , caution is needed when these regimens are prescribed to women with mild stress-related urine leakage or with established SUI risk factors.
