 Left lateral mitral isthmus ( LLMI) linear ablation is a safe and effective technique for treating left mitral flutter. LLMI linear ablation with pulmonary vein isolation may reduce the recurrence of persistent atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. However , epicardial ablation within the coronary sinus ( CS) is often required to create the LLMI block line. If the necessity for epicardial ablation is checked before ablation , complications may be reduced. We recruited 135 patients who underwent their first LLMI ablation and divided them into two groups , one group not requiring epicardial ablation for creating a conduction block at the LLMI ( Endo group) and another requiring it ( Epi group). These two groups were compared in terms of the electrogram characteristics of the CS. Bidirectional block through the LLMI was achieved in 94.8 % of patients. In 42 % of these patients , not only the endocardium but also the epicardium was ablated. As for the electrogram , the Endo group had lower atrium voltage and atrioventricular voltage ratios ( p = 0.009) than the Epi group before LLMI ablation. By contrast , there were no significant differences in the atrium voltage and the atrioventricular voltage ratio between these two groups after LLMI ablation. For creating a conduction block at the LLMI , the atrium voltage and the atrioventricular voltage ratio in the CS before ablation are important. The atrioventricular voltage ratio is a crucial criterion for determining whether epicardial ablation is necessary; furthermore , the atrioventricular voltage ratio in the CS must be reduced with or without epicardial ablation.
