 We theoretically investigate the electronic transport properties of curved graphene waveguides by employing non-equilibrium Green<symptom> 's function techniques. We systematically study the dependence of the confined waveguide modes on the potential difference , the width of waveguide and side barrier. Through two-terminal electronic transport calculations , we show that the conductance of confined waveguide modes is rather robust against the bending degree of waveguide , in consistence with the band insensitivity to the side barrier. This finding of the perfectly conducting channels strongly suggests the possibility of applying the graphene waveguide in the design of low-power nanoelectronics.
