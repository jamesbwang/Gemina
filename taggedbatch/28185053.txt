 Papillary thyroid cancer is a prevalent endocrine malignancy. Although alterations in glutamine metabolism have been reported in several types of hematological and solid tumors , little is known about the functions of glutamine and glutaminolysis-associated proteins in papillary thyroid cancer. Here , we demonstrated the glutamine dependence of papillary thyroid cancer cells , and with the use of RT PTC cells are glutamine-dependent , and GLS is aberrantly overexpressed in PTC. Inhibition of GLS suppressed glutaminolysis and reduced mitochondrial respiration<symptom>. Inhibition of GLS impairs the viability of PTC cells. GLS blockade causes deactivation of mTORC1 and induction of autophagy and apoptosis. GLS may be a potential therapeutic target for PTC.
