 Polar perovskite oxides are of considerable interest for developing advanced functional materials with exceptional electronic properties for their unique polar characters. A cleavage of polar perovskite oxides along the charged layers leads to an electrostatic instability on the cleaved surfaces , and a charge compensation is required to stabilize these surfaces. In this work , we have systemically studied 25 types of surface models of polar KTaO3 perovskite oxide , including ( 001) , ( 110) , and ( 111) surfaces with various types of surface terminations , using first-principles electronic structure calculations. The surface structural reconstruction , electronic structures , and thermodynamic properties including cleavage energy and surface energy are investigated. The phase stability diagrams of the ( 001) , ( 110) , and ( 111) surfaces are constructed with respect to the chemical potentials of component elements. The KO ( 001) , O ( 110) , and KO2 ( 111) terminations are more likely to be formed than other types of terminations in corresponding surfaces , consistent with experimental observations on KTaO3 ( 001) surfaces. This work provides useful guidance for accurate control of surface morphology for tailing functional properties of polar KTaO3 perovskite oxide.
