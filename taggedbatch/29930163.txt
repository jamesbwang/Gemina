 Inflammation<symptom> and B-cell hyperactivation have been associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma development. This prospective analysis aimed to further elucidate pre-diagnosis plasma immune marker profiles associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk. We identified 598 incident lymphoma cases and 601 matched controls in Nurses ' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study participants with archived pre-diagnosis plasma samples and measured 13 immune marker levels with multiplexed immunoassays. Using multivariable logistic regression we calculated odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals per standard deviation unit increase in biomarker concentration for risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and major histologic subtype , stratifying additional models by years ( < 5 , 5 to < 10 , ≥ 10) after blood draw. Soluble interleukin-2 receptor-α , CXC chemokine ligand 13 , soluble CD30 , and soluble tumor necrosis<symptom> factor receptor-2 were individually positively associated , and B-cell activating factor of the tumor necrosis<symptom> factor family inversely associated , with all non-Hodgkin lymphoma and one or more subtypes. The biomarker combinations associated independently with lymphoma varied somewhat by subtype and years after blood draw. Of note , the unexpected inverse association between B-cell activating factor and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma risk ( odds ratio: 95 % confidence interval: 0.51 , 0.43-0.62) persisted more than 10 years after blood draw ( odds ratio: 0.70; 95 % confidence interval: 0.52-0.93). In conclusion , immune activation precedes non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis by several years. Decreased B-cell activating factor levels may denote nascent chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> many years pre-diagnosis.
