 The present study planned to assess the medicinally important plants in the lower Margalla Hills of Islamabad , Pakistan using scanning electron microscopy of their pollens. Both quantitative and qualitative characters of the pollens were analyzed. The shapes of the pollen were prolate , spheroidal , elliptical , and oblate. Exine sculpturing showed rugulate , scabrate , psilate gemmate , and reticulate ornamentation. The people residing in the rural areas are thought to depend , primarily , on medicinal plant resources for many health care needs. A sample of 140 respondents was selected and interviewed by using a stratified random sampling technique. Results showed that the local communities of lower Margalla Hills are highly dependent on plants to treat various ailments , for example , respiratory ( 28 %) , digestive ( 46 %) nervous , circulatory and dermatological problems ( 6 % each) , and reproductive problems ( 8 %). The continuous dependence of the local community on ethnomedicinally important plants has led to serious degradation of the natural forest<disease> of lower Margalla Hills. Priority-based conservation and sustainable use of these forest<disease> resources are necessary , and use of alternative resources will also help in the forest<disease> conservation.
