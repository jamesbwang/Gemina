 Nine months after the implementation of a new electronic medical record ( EMR) system at a single institution , physicians ( MDs) , nurse practitioners ( NPs) , and physician assistants ( PAs) expressed frustration with its use. We aimed to test if an individually tailored training approach reduced time spent with the EMR and increased confidence. Two hours of training were conducted in a one-on-one manner with a trainer. Content was individualized according to the following: provider survey , EMR utilization profile , and shadowing in clinic. Surveys assessed confidence before training and immediately after training. Changes in time spent in various EMR activities before training and after training were compared. Three trainers delivered one-on-one training to 133 MDs , 42 NPs , and 10 PAs who specialized in medical oncology. Participants reported an increase in confidence across all activities , and almost all providers ( 98 %) who responded to our survey agreed that the training enhanced their efficiency. A non-statistically significant trend toward reduction in the overall time in the system was observed. Time in system was reduced primarily in activities such as documentation and ordering of laboratory tests , imaging , medications , and chemotherapy. A personalized and data-driven training approach was highly regarded by providers. EMR usage reports provided extensive data to identify and prioritize training content and were valuable to measure the impact of training on provider time in system. With the growth of EMR implementation and the reported relationship of EMR use to burnout , continuous and personalized training after EMR implementation is effective to reduce the time in system and increase confidence.
