 Chronic pruritus ( > 6 week 's duration) in the geriatric population ( â‰¥ 65 years old) , is an increasing health care problem. The pathophysiologic predisposing factors are abnormalities of the epidermal barrier , immune system , and nervous system. Causes can be dichotomized into histaminergic and nonhistaminergic pruritus. Topical treatments are generally safe. Systemic treatments are chosen depending on the condition , comorbid diseases , and drug interactions. Treatment options are limited. Progress has been made in identifying itch-selective mediators over the last decade. Numerous new medications are currently undergoing clinical trials and they are anticipated to enter the clinics in the near future.
