 Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive type of lysosomal storage disorder. The disease is very rare in Turkey , with an incidence of 0.54/ 100,000. The clinical manifestations of Tay-Sachs disease include progressive developmental delay , seizures<symptom> , deafness , blindness<symptom> , spasticity , and dystonia , which are caused by the accumulation of gangliosides in the central nervous system. To date , only one case indicating the association between Tay-Sachs disease and central precocious puberty has been reported. Although the mechanism of this association is not clear , it is thought to be due to ganglioside accumulation in the central nervous system or the inhibition of the hypothalamic inhibiting pathway. Herein , we report two patients with genetically proven Tay-Sachs disease who developed central precocious puberty during follow-up. Pubertal development in patients affected by Tay-Sachs disease should be carefully assessed.
