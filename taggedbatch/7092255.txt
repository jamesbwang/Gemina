 Sporotrichosis<disease> is the most common subcutaneous<disease> mycosis<disease>. It is caused by the dimorphic fungus Sporothrix<pathogen> schenckii<pathogen>. Ocular sporotrichosis<disease> is uncommon and has been rarely reported. We describe a 34-year-old female who presented with a nodule<disease> increasing in size near the medial angle of the left eye. Originally , she was misdiagnosed with a dacryocyst space-occupying lesion<symptom> , and the lesion<symptom> was removed by surgery. Findings of fungal structures in the histopathological examination contributed to the diagnosis of Sporothrix<pathogen> dacryocystitis. Further culture of conjunctival secretions and contact lens storage solution was positive for Sporothrix<pathogen>. She was treated with oral itraconazole , 200 mg by mouth<symptom> twice daily. After 3 months of treatment with oral itraconazole , culture of the conjunctival secretions was negative. It is of paramount importance to clinically suspect mycosis<disease> , even in unusual locations or in the absence of the typical epidemiological history.
