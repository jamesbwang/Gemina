 Rechargeable magnesium batteries have attracted increasing attention due to the high theoretical volumetric capacities , dendrite formation-free characteristic and low cost of Mg metal anodes. However , the development of magnesium batteries is seriously hindered by the lack of capable cathode materials with long cycling life and fast solid-state diffusion kinetics for highly-polarized divalent Mg
