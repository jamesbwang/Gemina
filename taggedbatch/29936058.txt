 Few studies have evaluated the expression of The Programmed cell death-1 and its ligand-1 ( PD-L1) in breast cancer. In this study we correlated differential expression of PD-L1 in breast cancer ( BC) and its microenvironment from a cohort of patients with BC , paired locally metastatic disease to regional lymph nodes ( LN) and non-paired distantly metastatic disease ( mets). PD-L1 expression was correlated with several pathologic and clinical parameters in tumor and tumor immune cells ( ICs) ( CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD20 and CD68) using the Ventana antibody ( SP263) in 41BC , 46 paired mets in LNs and 46 distant mets. There was 100 % agreement for PD-L1 expression on tumor and ICs between BC and matched LN. PD-L1 is differentially expressed in primary BC and regional nodal disease. Expression correlated with higher grade , hormone receptor negativity and highly proliferative tumors ( P < .001). In LNs , the high positivity rate was driven by triple negative status ( 70 % vs 5 %) ( P < .0001). In contrast there was significantly near total absence PD-L1 expression in distant mets compared to BC and LNs ( 2-4 % in Mets vs 17-20 % in BC and LN , P = .009). ICs density varied in BC and metastatic tumors with predominance of CD3 and CD68 and near total absence of CD20 cells. PD-L1 expression was mainly associated with CD68 cells. There were consistent higher numbers of CD3 ( CD8 > CD4) than CD20 cells in primary and metastatic tumors. Correlation of PD-L1 expression in BC and its microenvironment may be useful for development of new treatment strategies.
