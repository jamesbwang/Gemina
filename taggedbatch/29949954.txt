 Venn and Euler diagrams are extensively used for the visualization of relationships between experiments and datasets. However , representing more than three datasets while keeping the proportions of each region is still not feasible with existing tools. We present an algorithm to render all the regions of a generalized n-dimensional Venn diagram , while keeping the area of each region approximately proportional to the number of elements included. In addition , missing regions in Euler diagrams lead to simplified representations. The algorithm generates an n-dimensional Venn diagram and inserts circles of given areas in each region. Then , the diagram is rearranged with a dynamic , self-correcting simulation in which each set border is contracted until it contacts the circles inside. This algorithm is implemented in a C++ tool ( nVenn) with or without a web interface. The web interface also provides the ability to analyze the regions of the diagram. The source code and pre-compiled binaries of nVenn are available at https://github.com/vqf/nVenn. A web interface for up to six sets can be accessed at http://degradome.uniovi.es/cgi-bin/nVenn/nvenn.cgi. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
