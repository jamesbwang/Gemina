 Tolvaptan ( TLV) is known to increase electrolyte-free water clearance. However , TLV actions on renal electrolytes including urine sodium ( uNa) excretion and its consequences are less well understood. This subanalysis investigated the effect of add-on TLV compared to increased furosemide ( FUR) on both electrolyte-free water and electrolyte clearance in patients with congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( CHF) complicated by advanced chronic kidney disease ( CKD). The Kanagawa Aquaresis Investigators Trial of TLV on HF Patients with Renal Impairment ( K-STAR) was a multicenter , open-labeled , randomized , and controlled prospective clinical study. Eighty-one Japanese patients with CHF and residual signs of congestion<symptom> despite oral FUR treatment ( ≥ 40 mg/day) were recruited and randomly assigned to a 7-day add-on treatment with either ≤ 40 mg/day FUR or ≤ 15 mg/day TLV. Electrolyte-free water clearance , electrolyte osmolar clearance and electrolyte excretion were compared between the two groups before and after therapy. The change ( Δ) in electrolyte-free water clearance was significantly higher in the add-on TLV group than in the add-on FUR group. However , Δelectrolyte osmolar clearance was also higher in the add-on TLV group than in the increased FUR group. This was primarily because ΔuNa excretion was significantly higher in the add-on TLV group than in the increased FUR group , since Δurine potassium excretion was significantly lower in the add-on TLV group than in the increased FUR group. Add-on TLV may increase both renal water and Na excretion in CHF patients with advanced CKD to a greater degree than increased FUR.
