 The infliximab biosimilar has entered daily inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) practice. However , real-life outcomes beyond 1 year after switching are scarce. We aimed to investigate the long-term drug survival , immunogenicity , and pharmacokinetics 2 years after switching to CT-P13 in IBD patients. We performed a single-center prospective observational cohort study in all Remicade-treated IBD patients who previously switched to CT-P13. We systematically documented reasons for discontinuation , trough levels , and antidrug antibodies to infliximab ( ADAs) at baseline , week 16 , week 52 , and week 104. Clinical and biochemical disease activity ( HBI , SCCAI , CRP) and adverse events were registered. Eighty-three patients were enrolled , 57 had Crohn 's disease , 24 had ulcerative colitis<disease> , and 2 were IBD-unclassified. At week 104 , 55 of 83 ( 66 %) patients remained on CT-P13 , and 3 were lost to follow-up. Reasons for discontinuation were loss of response ( n = 10) , adverse events ( n = 8) , and disease remission ( n = 7). ADAs were present in 5/83 patients at baseline ( before switching) , in 2 patients before week 52 , and no subsequent ADAs were detected until week 104. Median trough levels and clinical and biochemical disease activity at baseline , week 16 , week 52 and week 104 did not significantly change. In a prospective cohort with > 2-year follow-up , 66 % of IBD patients continued CT-P13 after switching from Remicade. Two new cases with ADAs were observed in year 1 , but subsequently no immunogenicity was detected. These results are reassuring and suggest that switching to CT-P13 does not impact long-term clinical outcomes. 10.1093/ ibd/izy227 _ video1izy227.video15802479819001.
