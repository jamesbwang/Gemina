 Mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis<disease> ( MsPGN) , one of the most common glomerulonephritis<disease> pathological types , often leads to end-stage renal disease over a prolonged period. But the current treatment of MsPGN is non-specific and causes serious side effects , thus novel therapeutics and targeting strategies are urgently demanded. By combining the advantages of PEG-PLGA nanoparticles and the size selection mechanism of renal glomerulus , we designed and developed a novel PEG-PLGA nanoparticle delivery system capable of delivering dexamethasone acetate ( A-DEX) into glomerular mesangium. We determined that 90 nm was the optimum size to encapsulate A-DEX for glomerular mesangium targeting based on the size-selection mechanism of glomerulus. After intravenous administration in rats , 90 nm DiD-loaded NPs were found to accumulate to a greater extent in the kidney and kidney cortex compared with the free DiD solution. The 90 nm A-DEX NPs are also more stable at room temperature and showed a sustained release pattern. In rat glomerular mesangial cells ( HBZY-1) in vitro , we found that the uptake of 90 nm A-DEX NPs was both temperature-dependent and energe-dependent , and they were mostly engulfed via clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathways. In summary , we have successfully developed a glomerular mesangium-targeted PEG-PLGA NPs , which is potential for the treatment of MsPGN.
