 The concentration of diagnostic markers such as inflammatory biomarkers including procalcitonin ( PCT) and C-reactive protein ( CRP) increases in bacterial infections. The aim of this study was to compare serum PCT and CRP levels with CURB-65 ranking , in the patients with community-acquired pneumonia<disease> ( CAP). In a cross-sectional study , 93 hospitalized patients with a definite diagnosis of CAP , considering inclusion and exclusion criteria , were enrolled. Serum PCT and CRP levels and their relations with CURB-65 criteria were assessed. The mean serum levels of PCT and CRP were 3.64 ± 12.32 ng/mL and 75.01 ± 51.93 mg/L , respectively. There was a statistically significant association between CURB-65 criteria and serum levels of PCT ( According to the results , the serum level of PCT or CRP is a strong prognostic factor for evaluating severity of CAP and is a suitable factor for the CURB-65 criteria in the decision making of whether a patient with CAP in the ICU should be admitted.
