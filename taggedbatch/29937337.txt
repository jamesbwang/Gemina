 The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate the effect of a delayed diagnosis of Charcot foot on acute care cost and usage. We used International Classification of Disease , Ninth Revision , Clinical Modification codes , and the California Office for Statewide Health Planning and Development 2009 to 2012 public patient discharge files to identify patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and Charcot foot. The costs and length of stay were compared for those with a diagnosis of Charcot foot on admission compared with those who received a delayed diagnosis of Charcot foot before discharge. Patient demographic data , diagnoses often mistaken for Charcot foot , and procedures often performed for Charcot foot were assessed to determine the potential effect on costs and length of stay in Charcot foot subjects. A delayed Charcot foot diagnosis was associated with 10.8 % greater inpatient costs and 12.1 % longer length of stay. These patients required greater resource usage owing to the significantly greater number of procedures performed. A significantly greater number of patients underwent lower extremity amputation when the diagnosis was delayed , resulting in a 30.4 % increase in costs and 31.6 % longer length of stay. A greater rate of diabetic foot ulcers<disease><symptom> , foot infections , and osteomyelitis<disease> was also observed; however , the cost was only affected by osteomyelitis<disease> , and the length of stay was not significantly affected. A delayed diagnosis of Charcot foot at admission resulted in significantly increased acute care costs and longer lengths of stay.
