 Chemoradiotherapy ( CRT) is the standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer; however , the optimal chemotherapy sequence to administer simultaneously with radiotherapy remains unclear. We conducted a phase I/II study to test a new regimen , TEGAFIRI ( combination tegafur , uracil ( UFT) , leucovorin ( LV) , irinotecan) , for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. A total of 22 patients with locally advanced lower rectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled in the present study. The radiation dose was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. UFT ( 300 mg/m Dose-limiting toxicity was not observed at any dosing level. The most frequent adverse event was leukopenia<symptom> ( 50 %) , followed by diarrhea<disease><symptom> ( 45.5 %) , anal pain ( 31.8 %) , and neutropenia ( 27.3 %). All were well-managed with the appropriate drugs. The total pathologic complete response rate was 22.7 % , and the proportion of good responders was 28.6 % , 50 % , and 71.4 % at levels 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively. None of the patients experienced local recurrence. The 5-year relapse-free and overall survival rates were 80.4 % and 80.8 % , respectively. TEGAFIRI is a promising CRT regimen that results in marked tumor regression and good local control. Moreover , its adverse events are well-tolerated.
