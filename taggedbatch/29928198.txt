 Recent industrial developments in autonomous systems , or agents , which assume that humans and the agents share the same space or even work in close proximity , open for new challenges in robotics , especially in motion planning and control. In these settings , the control system should be able to provide these agents a reliable path following control when they are working in a group or in collaboration with one or several humans in complex and dynamic environments. In such scenarios , these agents are not only moving to reach their goals , i.e. , locations , they are also aware of the movements of other entities to find a collision-free path. Thus , this paper proposes a dependable , i.e. , safe , reliable and effective , path planning algorithm for a group of agents that share their working space with humans. Firstly , the method employs the Theta
