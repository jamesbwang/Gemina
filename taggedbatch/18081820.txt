 The frequent or regular use of analgesics and anti-migraine drugs can make headache<symptom> more frequent and induce the transformation of episodic to chronic<symptom> headache<symptom>. Chronic<symptom> headache<symptom> due to medication overuse is defined as headache<symptom> that is present on ≥ 15 days per month for at least three months in a patient who previously suffered from primary headaches<symptom> , and who takes analgesics on ≥ 15 days per month or anti-migraine drugs ( triptans or ergot alkaloids) , opioid drugs , or combined analgesics on ≥ 10 days per month. This review is based on pertinent articles published up to December 2017 that were retrieved by a selective search in PubMed employing the terms `` medication overuse AND headache<symptom> '' and `` medication overuse headache<symptom>. '' The prevalence of medication overuse headache<symptom> in the general population in Germany is 0.7 % -1 %. This disorder is more common in women and in persons suffering from comorbid mental disorders or other painful conditions. The treatment of medication overuse headache<symptom> consists of three steps. Patient education and counseling are given with the goal of reducing the intake of medication for acute<symptom> headache<symptom> treatment. The ensuing headache<symptom> prophylaxis is with topiramate , amitriptyline , or onabotulinum toxin A. If these treatment strategies fail , a drug holiday is recommended. This can be in the outpatient , day clinic , or inpatient setting , depending on the severity of the condition and its comorbidities. Patients who frequently take acute medication to treat headache<symptom> episodes must be identified early in order to avoid headache<symptom> chronification and medication overuse headache<symptom>. The suggested treatment algorithm is still in need of validation by randomized trials.
