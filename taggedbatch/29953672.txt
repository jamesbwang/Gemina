 Forkhead box M1 ( FOXM1) was initially identified as an oncogenic transcription factor , and multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that FOXM1 is abundantly expressed and plays an irreplaceable role in several types of human cancers. Also , evidence has shown the association of FOXM1 with gastric carcinoma metastasis and patients prognosis; however , the potential role and molecular mechanism of FOXM1 in gastric cancer cell apoptosis are still obscure. The current study indicates that FOXM1 is highly expressed in a variety of gastric carcinoma cell lines , such as BGC823 , MGC803 , AGS , and SGC-7901 , compared with the normal gastric mucosal epithelial cell lines CES-1. FOXM1 silence markedly inhibits AGS and SGC-7901 cell survival and proliferation , increases their apoptosis , and modulates apoptosis-related protein expression , including reduced Bcl-2 level and increased Bax and caspase-3 levels. Further study showed that FOXM1 depletion induced cell autophagy through increasing the level of beclin-1 and decreasing the P62 expression. We next corroborated that FOXM1 silence abolished the expression of Sirtuin 7 ( SIRT7) and increased the level of insulin-like growth factor 2 ( IGF2) and mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR). Finally , our data documented that the SIRT7/mTOR/IGF2 pathway was involved in the function of FOXM1 in AGS cell growth and apoptosis. In conclusion , these results confirmed that FOXM1 is involved in gastric carcinoma progression via the SIRT7/mTOR/IGF2 pathway.
