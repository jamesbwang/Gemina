 Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC) is the dominant histological type of esophageal cancer worldwide ( 90 %). We aimed to provide an update of the global temporal trends in the incidence of ESCC. Incidence data for ESCC were collected from 30 well-established cancer registries from 20 countries in Europe , Northern America , Australia , or Asia for 1970-2015. Time trends in annual age-standardized incidence rates of ESCC were assessed using joinpoint analysis and log-linear regression. Age-period-cohort analysis was used to estimate the influence of age , calendar-period , and birth-cohort on the observed time trends in incidence. The age-standardized incidence rates of ESCC varied more than eightfold in men and sevenfold in women across populations. In 2012 , the highest rate of ESCC in men was observed in Nagasaki , Japan ( 9.7/ 100,000 person-years) and in women in Scotland ( 2.7/ 100,000 person-years). In men , the incidence decreased globally during the study period , as well as during the last few years. In women , the incidence increased in Japan ( three regions) , the Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , and Switzerland , whereas it stabilized or decreased in other populations. Among ethnic groups in the United States , black men and women had more pronounced decreases in incidence than other groups. Generally , birth-cohort effects were stronger determinants of incidence trends than calendar-period effects. In men , the global ESCC incidence has decreased over time. In women , the incidence trends vary across populations , and the rates have increased in some countries. Changes in the prevalence of tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption may have contributed to these time trends.
