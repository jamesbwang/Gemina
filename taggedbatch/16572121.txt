 MALT1 controls several receptors-mediated signaling to nuclear factor κB ( NF-κB) through both its scaffold and protease function. MALT1 protease activity is shown to inactivate several negative regulators of NF-κB signaling and augment NF-κB activation ability. In this study , MALT1 was demonstrated to autoprocess itself in the presence of oligomerization-competent BCL10. Cleavage occurred after Arginine 781 located in the C-terminus of MALT1. Shortened MALT1 cleavage products showed attenuated binding ability with TRAF6. Its NF-κB activation ability was also weakened. Various MALT1 constructs including wild type , catalytically-inactive ( MALT1_C464A) , cleavage-defective ( MALT1_R781L) , or truncated ( MALT1_1-781) form of MALT1 was introduced into MALT1-knocked-down-Jurkat T cells. Cleavage-defective MALT1_R781L retained its proteolytic and initial IκBα phosphorylation activity as MALT1. Truncated MALT1_1-781 mutant showed weakness<symptom> in IκBα phosphorylation and the expression of NF-κB targets IL-2 and IFN-γ. Cleavage at R781 was detectable but marginal after activation with TPA/ionomycin or anti-CD3 antibody in lymphocytes. However , cleavage at R781 was evident in ABC-DLBCL cells such as OCI-Ly3 , HBL-1. HBL-1 cells with induced expression of catalytically-inactive MALT1_C464A or cleavage-defective MALT1_R781L exhibited characteristic of retarded-growth. These findings suggested that cleavage at R781 of MALT1 played a role in the survival of ABC-DLBCL cells.
