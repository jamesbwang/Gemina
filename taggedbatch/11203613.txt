 BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the load-bearing capacities of three-unit direct resin-bonded fiber-reinforced composite fixed dental prosthesis with different framework designs. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty mandibular premolar and molar teeth without caries<disease> were collected and direct glass fiber-resin fixed FDPs were divided into 6 groups ( n = 10). Each group was restored via direct technique with different designs. In Group 1 , the inlay-retained bridges formed 2 unidirectional FRC frameworks and pontic-reinforced transversal FRC. In Group 2 , the inlay-retained bridges were supported by unidirectional lingual and occlusal FRC frameworks. Group 3 , had buccal and lingual unidirectional FRC frameworks without the inlay cavities. Group 4 had reinforced inlay cavities and buccal-lingual FRC with unidirectional FRC frameworks. Group 5 , had a circular form of fiber reinforcement around cusps in addition to buccal-lingual FRC frameworks. Group 6 had a circular form of fiber reinforcement around cusps with 2 bidirectional FRC frameworks into inlay cavities. All groups were loaded until final fracture using a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. RESULTS Mean values of the groups were determined with ANOVA and Tukey HSD. When all data were evaluated , Group 6 had the highest load-bearing capacities and revealed significant differences from Group 3 and Group 4. Group 6 had the highest strain ( p > 0.05). When the fracture patterns were investigated , Group 6 had the durability to sustain fracture propagation within the restoration. CONCLUSIONS The efficiency of fiber reinforcement of the restorations alters not only the amount of fiber , but also the design of the restoration with fibers.
