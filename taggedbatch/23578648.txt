 The terahertz ( THz) frequency range corresponds to molecular vibrations or relaxation modes such as those for the hydrogen bond. Most biomolecules are activated only in aqueous solutions , thus , to understand the function and structure of biomolecules , it is necessary to investigate the characteristics of electromagnetic waves in hydrated samples. THz radiation causes little damage to the human body , thus it is expected that it can be applied for noninvasive examinations. However , spectrometry of the transmitted light is difficult , since the absorption of THz radiation in water is extremely high. In this study , we used sub-THz radiation ( frequencies near to 0.1 THz) , where the absorption is lower than for THz radiation , to measure the reflectance of a glucose water solution. We found that the reflectance decreases in proportion with the glucose concentration. These results suggest that sub-THz radiation can be used in the noninvasive measurement of blood glucose levels.
