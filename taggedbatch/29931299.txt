 Proteoglycans are among the most abundant and structurally complex biomacromolecules and play critical roles in connective tissues. They are composed of a core protein onto which glycosaminoglycan ( GAG) side chains are attached via a linker region. Biallelic mutations in B3GALT6 , encoding one of the linker region glycosyltransferases , are known to cause either spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia ( SEMD) or a severe pleiotropic form of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes<disease><symptom> ( EDS). This study provides clinical , molecular and biochemical data on 12 patients with biallelic B3GALT6 mutations. Notably , all patients have features of both EDS and SEMD. In addition , some patients have severe and potential life-threatening complications such as aortic dilatation and aneurysm<disease> , cervical spine instability , and respiratory insufficiency. Whole-exome sequencing , next generation panel sequencing , and direct sequencing identified biallelic B3GALT6 mutations in all patients. We show that these mutations reduce the amount of β3GalT6 protein and lead to a complete loss of galactosyltransferase activity. In turn , this leads to deficient GAG synthesis , and ultrastructural abnormalities in collagen fibril organization. In conclusion , this study redefines the phenotype associated with B3GALT6 mutations on the basis of clinical , molecular and biochemical data in 12 patients , and provides an in-depth assessment of β3GalT6 activity and GAG synthesis to better understand this rare condition.
