 Cellular senescence is the permanent cell cycle arrest induced either by chronological ageing or extrinsic stimuli. Recent researches have identified cellular senescence as an important mechanism for atherosclerosis , which is the essential pathophysiological contributor to cardiovascular diseases ( CVDs). The sirtuins are a family of cellular deacetylases with fundamental abilities to regulate cellular metabolism and a variety of physiological activities. Previous studies have revealed the anti-ageing functions of sirtuins as the longevity-associated proteins. These advances indicate the potential beneficial functions of sirtuins in atherosclerosis by affecting cellular senescence. Herein , we review the recent findings about sirtuins in regulating atherosclerotic cellular senescence , and discuss the possibility of activating sirtuins as a therapeutic strategy for combating atherosclerosis.
