 Objective: Interleukin-6 ( IL-6) is an inflammatory cytokine shown to be a strong factor for growth , proliferation and metastasis with many malignancies. The promoter single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs) -174 G > C ( rs1800795) can alter the transcriptional pattern of this gene. The present study was aimed at assessing effects of the IL-6 ( rs1800795) SNP on risk of benign prostate hyperplasia<disease> ( BPH) and prostatic adenocarcinoma ( PCa). Methods: The project was performed on 112 men with PCa , 118 with BPH and 250 healthy controls. After DNA extraction , genotyping of IL-6 ( rs1800795) was performed using PCR TaqMan Allelic Discrimination ( ABI MGB). Results: The G allele frequency for rs1800795 of the IL-6 gene was 74.1 % , 68.6 % and 67 % in PCa patients , BPH patients and healthy men , respectively. PCa and control groups showed significant differences ( P = 0.030 , OR = 1.73 , 95 % CI: 1.05-2.21). The GG genotype was more frequent in the PCa group , whereas the GC genotype was more common in the BPH in comparison to other groups. Conclusion: The current study identified IL-6 -174 G > C ( rs1800795) as a significant predictor of susceptibility for prostate cancer and bone metastasis in a northwest Iranian population.
