 To determine the diagnostic performance of macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer ( GCIPL) thickness measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT) for glaucoma detection in a Chinese population in comparison with optic nerve head ( ONH) and retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL) parameters measured by both SD-OCT and Heidelberg Retina Tomography 3 ( HRT-3). Adults aged 40 to 80 years were recruited from the population-based study ( n = 3353 , response rate 72.8 %). Macular cube 200x200 scan was performed with Cirrus SD-OCT ( version 6.0 , Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc , Dublin , CA) for GCIPL thickness measurement. ONH and RNFL imaging was performed with Cirrus SD-OCT and HRT-3 ( Heidelberg Engineering , Heidelberg , Germany). Glaucoma was defined according to International Society for Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology criteria. In total , 86 eyes of 60 subjects with glaucoma and 1709 eyes of 1001 non-glaucoma participants were included. The best performing parameters for Cirrus SD-OCT GCIPL , Cirrus SD-OCT ONH and HRT-3 were minimum GCIPL thickness ( Area under receiver-operating curve ( AUC) = 0.89 , 95 % CI 0.83-0.95) , vertical cup-disc ratio ( CDR) ( AUC = 0.94 , 0.91-0.98) and vertical CDR ( AUC = 0.86 , 0.81-0.92) , respectively. At 85 % specificity , vertical CDR measured using Cirrus OCT ONH scan showed the highest sensitivity ( 88.64 % , 95 % CI 75.4-96.2) compared to minimum GCIPL thickness with sensitivity of 60.53 % ( 95 % CI 46.4-73.0) ( p < 0.001). Inferior RNFL thickness ( AUC = 0.84 , 95 % CI 0.91-0.97) measured by Cirrus SD-OCT was also superior to Cirrus SD-OCT GCIPL ( p < 0.007). The diagnostic performance of macular GCIPL scan is inferior compared to vertical CDR measured by Cirrus OCT ONH scan. Cirrus OCT ONH scan showed the best ability in detecting glaucoma in a Chinese population , suggesting it could be a good glaucoma screening tool in an Asian population.
