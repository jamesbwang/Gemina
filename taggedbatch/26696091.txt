 Intraspinal human spinal cord-derived neural stem cell ( HSSC) transplantation is a potential therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS); however , previous trials lack controls. This post hoc analysis compared ambulatory limb-onset ALS participants in Phase 1 and 2 ( Ph1/2) open-label intraspinal HSSC transplantation studies up to 3 years after transplant to matched participants in Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials ( PRO-ACT) and ceftriaxone datasets to provide required analyses to inform future clinical trial designs. Survival , ALSFRS-R , and a composite statistic ( ALS/SURV) combining survival and ALS Functional Rating Scale revised ( ALSFRS-R) functional status were assessed for matched participant subsets: PRO-ACT Survival did not differ significantly between cohorts: Ph1/2 median survival 4.7 years , 95 % CI ( 1.2 , âˆž) versus PRO-ACT 2.3 years ( 1.9 , 2.5) , Comparison of Ph1/2 studies to historical datasets revealed significantly improved survival and function using ALS/SURV versus PRO-ACT controls. While results are encouraging , comparison against historical populations demonstrate limitations in noncontrolled studies. These findings support continued evaluation of HSSC transplantation in ALS , support the benefit of control populations , and enable necessary power calculations to design a randomized , sham surgery-controlled efficacy study.
