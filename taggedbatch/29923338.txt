 Several proteomic analyses have been performed on synaptic fractions isolated from cortex or even total brain , resulting in preparations with a high synaptic heterogeneity and complexity. Synaptoneurosomes ( SNs) are subcellular membranous elements that contain sealed pre- and post-synaptic components. They are obtained by subcellular fractionation of brain homogenates and serve as a suitable model to study many aspects of the synapse physiology. Here the proteomic content of SNs isolated from hippocampus of adult mice , a brain region involved in memory that presents lower synaptic heterogeneity than cortex , is reported. Interestingly , in addition to pre- and post-synaptic proteins , proteins involved in RNA binding and translation are overrepresented in this preparation. These results validate the protocol previously reported for SNs isolation , and , as reported by other authors , highlight the relevance of local synaptic translation for hippocampal physiology.
