 To explore the effects of hydrogen on liver injury in chronic intermittent hypoxia rats and the related oxidative stress mechanism. Twenty-four male adult SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups ( Compared with Norm group , the microstructure of liver cells was severely injured , and the serum levels of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase ( ALT) , glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase ( AST) were significantly higher in CIH group ( Pre-treatment with hydrogen could improve the liver injury caused by chronic intermittent hypoxia , and reducing oxidative stress level for protecting the liver cells damage.
