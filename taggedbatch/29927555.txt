 Here we provide instructions to measure topographic memory in mice using the Hamlet test , a complex environment. The apparatus mimics a small hamlet with a central agora and five houses , which are functionalized since mice can drink , eat pellets , hide within a small maze , run in an activity wheel , or interact with a stranger mouse behind a grid. The houses are interconnected through a network of streets in a five-arm star shape , and a video tracking system takes information from the activity in each house or follows a single mouse by trajectometry. Training the mice in the Hamlet , in groups for several hours per day over several days or weeks , allows consolidation of topographic memory ( i.e. , route learning involving both allocentric and egocentric strategies). Analysis of topographic memory can be performed a posteriori in a probe test by depriving mice of water or food and measuring their ability to efficiently reach the `` eat '' or `` drink '' house. Control groups include mice tested in non-deprived condition and mice naïve to the Hamlet and tested in deprived or non-deprived conditions. The present article details the apparatus , procedures , and protocols that can be used to reliably habituate mice in this complex environment and measure topographic memory. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
