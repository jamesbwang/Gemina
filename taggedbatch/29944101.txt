 A novel dopamine biosensor based on carbon fiber microelectrodes ( CFMEs) modified with copper ( I) sulfide functionalized nanocomposites of the reduced graphene oxide ( Cu2S/RGO) has been explored for the sensitive detection of dopamine and in vivo monitoring the neurotransmitters released by Drosophila 's brain. The as-prepared Cu2S/RGO decorated microelectrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) , and cyclic voltammetry ( CV). Our observations demonstrate that Cu2S/RGO-CFMEs exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity for dopamine with relatively low detection limit ( 24 nM) , wide linear range ( i.e. , from 0.1-20 Î¼M) and outstanding reproducibility. Furthermore , the as-prepared new dopamine biosensor with high sensitivity and good stability was readily used to detect the amount of dopamine in the brain of drosophila , indicating the potential and promising application in the in vivo measurement of neurotransmitters without other electrochemical interference such as histidine , ascorbic acid , uric acid , and others.
