 Renal insufficiency , as evidenced by an increase in creatinine , is associated with higher mortality in patients with acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( AHF). Conversely , hemoconcentration ( HC) in AHF is associated with lower mortality , but can also cause an increase in creatinine. Our aim was to assess the prognosis of HC in patients hospitalized for AHF presenting with or without worsening renal function ( WRF). A total of 618 consecutive patients admitted for AHF were included. WRF was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO) criteria and HC was defined as an elevation of hemoglobin during hospitalization compared to the admission value. Six-month all-cause mortality was analyzed. The patients ' mean age was 79 Â± 11 years; 58 % were women. Mortality at six months was 38 % and 49 % of patients had WRF. HC occurred in 38.9 % of patients with WRF and was associated with improved survival ( HR 1.6 , 95 % CI 1.10-2.34; p = 0.02) compared to WRF without HC. HC was associated with better survival in KDIGO stages 1 and 2 ( HR 1.8; 95 % CI 1.1-2.8; p = 0.01). For patients without chronic kidney disease ( CKD) with WRF in stages 1 and 2 , HC was associated with significantly better survival ( HR 2.3; 95 % CI 1.2-4.2; p = 0.01). In patients admitted for AHF without renal<symptom> failure<symptom> or CKD , WRF with HC is associated with a better prognosis , similar to that of patients without WRF , and should therefore be reclassified as ` pseudo-WRF '.
