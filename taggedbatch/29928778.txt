 Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia<symptom> of Charlevoix-Saguenay ( ARSACS) is an early-onset neurodegenerative human<disease> disease<disease> characterized in part by ataxia<symptom> and Purkinje cell loss in anterior cerebellar lobules. A knock-out mouse model has been developed that recapitulates several features of ARSACS. Using this ARSACS mouse model , we report changes in synaptic input and intrinsic firing in cerebellar Purkinje cells , as well as in their synaptic output in the deep cerebellar nuclei. Changes in firing are observed in anterior lobules that later exhibit Purkinje cell death , but not in posterior lobules that do not. Our results show that both synaptic and intrinsic alterations in Purkinje cell properties likely contribute to disease manifestation in ARSACS; these findings resemble pathophysiological changes reported in several other ataxias<symptom>. Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia<symptom> of Charlevoix-Saguenay ( ARSACS) is an early-onset neurodegenerative disease that includes a pronounced and progressive cerebellar dysfunction. ARSACS is caused by an autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutation in the Sacs gene that encodes the protein sacsin. To better understand the cerebellar pathophysiology in ARSACS , we studied synaptic and firing properties of Purkinje cells from a mouse model of ARSACS , Sacs
