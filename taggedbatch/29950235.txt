 To investigate the effect of blocking polypyrimidine complex binding to DNA site by using peptide nucleic acid ( PNA) on γ-globin gene expression. PYR-PNA , β-PNA and RS-PNA ( random sequence-PNA) were designed and synthesized , then were transfected into K562 cells with the cationic liposome lipofectamine 2000 used as vector. The expression of γ-globin gene at both the transcriptional and translational level was detected by RT-PCR and the Western blot respectively at 24 h , 48 h and 72 h after transfection with PNAs. Compared with RS-PNA and control groups , the expression of γ-globin gene at mRNA and protein levels in PYR-PNA group was significantly up-regulated ( P < 0.05) , especially at 48 h after tranfection , the levels of mRNA and protein in PYR-PNA group were increased by 2.0 and 2.5 times than those in control group , respectively. PYR-PNA can significantly up-regulate the expression of γ-globin gene in K562 cells , this study may provide a new research idea for gene therapy of β-thalassemia.
