 Ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) is a chronic<disease> inflammatory disorder of the large intestine histologically characterized by indistinct sustained inflammatory responses. Genetical susceptibility and environmental factors ' effects play the roles in disease occurrence and it can be life threatening if remains untreated. It seems that intensification of inflammatory responses in this condition is not restricted to a specific cell line of T lymphocytes. Our aim was to determine the number of T helper 9 ( Th9) cells in inflamed colonic biopsies of UC patients. We also correlated it with interleukin ( IL) -9 protein level in addition to certain genes expressions associated with Th9 phenotype. Expression of CD4 and IL-9 were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) was performed to determine the colonic expression of IL-9 protein and finally mRNA expressions of interferon regulatory factor 4 ( Irf4) , Smad2 , and Smad3 were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) as critical transcription factors of Th9 differentiation. Number of Th9 cells was significantly increased in inflamed samples as compared with normal tissues. Also quantitative measurement of IL-9 by ELISA and mRNA expressions of Irf4 , Smad2 , and Smad3 showed notable correlative enhancements in patient 's samples. Function and number of Th9 cells are up-regulated in the inflamed mucosa of UC patients as with the protein secretion of IL-9 and mRNA expressions of Irf4 , Smad2 , and Smad3 , so Th9 cells and IL-9 may become remarkable therapeutic targets for IBD treatment in the future.
