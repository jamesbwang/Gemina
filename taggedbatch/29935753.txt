 Parkinson 's disease ( PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder involving the basal ganglia , resulting in motor and extra-motor deficits. These extra-motor deficits may be reflective of a self-regulatory deficit impacting patients ' ability to regulate cognitive processes , thoughts , behaviors , and emotions. There is a need to further examine the prevalence and range of self-regulation ( SR) and executive functioning ( EF) impairments in PD. This study sought to do so in a sample of patients with PD ( N = 31) who underwent deep brain stimulation ( DBS) surgery for motor<symptom> symptom<symptom> treatment. Patients completed measures indicative of SR and EF including neurocognitive tests , heart rate variability ( HRV) , and self-report questionnaires to examine these constructs in PD. The highest prevalence of impairments were observed for total impulse control disorder ( ICD) symptoms ( 74 %) , depressive symptoms ( 48 %) , verbal fluency ( phonemic: 39 %; semantic: 36 %) , mental flexibility ( 32 %) , and self-reported SR impairments ( Metacognition: 32 %; Behavioral Regulation: 29 %). Correlations among theoretically related constructs ( i.e. , SR , EF) were modest and variable; challenging the idea that SR is a unitary construct for which different domains depend on a common resource. In patients with PD post-DBS , higher resting HRV , thought to be indicative of better autonomic functioning , was linked to better EF in some instances but not others and not significantly associated with self-report SR.. Overall , patients with PD exhibit various extra-motor deficits , ranging from subtle to severe. Health care professionals working with patients with PD should recognize the presence of extra-motor deficits , particularly ICDs , and obstacles that might arise from such impairments in patients ' daily lives.
