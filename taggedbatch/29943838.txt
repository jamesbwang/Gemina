 Onychomycosis is an uncommon condition in childhood , but prevalence in children is increasing worldwide.The objective was to review the efficacy and safety of systemic and topical antifungal agents to treat onychomycosis in children. Databases ( Pubmed , OVID , Scopus , clinicaltrials.gov , Cochrane Library) were searched. Seven studies were selected for inclusion. Only one was a randomized controlled trial. In total , 208 children were administered antifungal agents for the treatment of onychomycosis. Four reports of mild adverse events were documented ( 1.9 % of treated children) , one of which discontinued treatment ( 0.5 %). Limitations of this review are the lack of randomized controlled trials available in pediatric onychomycosis. These findings suggest that antifungal therapies used to treat onychomycosis in children are associated with a low incidence of adverse events. Current dosing regimens for antifungal drugs are effective and appear safe to use in children , notwithstanding that the Food and Drug Administration has not approved any of these agents for the treatment of onychomycosis in children. To our knowledge , this review is the most up-to-date , comprehensive summary of pediatric onychomycosis treatment.
