 Approximately 20-30 % of all intracranial metastases are located in the posterior fossa. The clinical evolution hinges on factors such as tumor growth dynamics , local topographic conditions , performance status , and prompt intervention. Fourth ventricle ( V4) compression with secondary life-threatening obstructive hydrocephalus<symptom> remains a major concern , often requiring acute surgical intervention. We have previously reported on the application of adaptive hypofractionated Gamma Knife Radiosurgery in the acute management of critically located metastases , a technique known to us as rapid rescue radiosurgery ( 3R). We report the results of 3R in the management of posterior fossa lesions<symptom> and ensuing V4 decompression. Four patients with V4 compression due to posterior fossa metastases were treated with 3R by three separate gamma knife radiosurgical sessions ( GKRS) over a period of seven days. Mean V4 volume was 1.02 cm For this series , 3R was effective in terms of rapid tumor ablation , V4 decompression , and limited radiation-induced toxicity. This surgical procedure may become an additional tool in the management of intractable posterior fossa metastasis with V4 compression.
