 In ovo research is a valuable option of preclinical research , but imaging studies are severely limited by the costs of dedicated equipment needed for small-size eggs. We sought to verify the feasibility of using larger eggs of ostrich ( Struthio camelus) for the imaging with PET/CT scanners used for routine clinical investigations.
