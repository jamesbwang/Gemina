 To date , the molecular mechanism underlying constitutive signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3) activation in gliomas is largely unclear. In this study , we report that Smad6 is overexpressed in nuclei of glioma cells , which correlates with poor patient survival and regulates STAT3 activity via negatively regulating the Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT3 ( PIAS3). Mechanically , Smad6 interacts directly with PIAS3 , and this interaction is mediated through the Mad homology 2 ( MH2) domain of Smad6 and the Ring domain of PIAS3. Smad6 recruits Smurf1 to facilitate PIAS3 ubiquitination and degradation , which also depends on the MH2 domain and the PY motif of Smad6. Consequently , Smad6 reduces PIAS3-mediated STAT3 inhibition and promotes glioma cell growth and stem-like cell initiation. Moreover , the Smad6 MH2 transducible protein restores PIAS3 expression and subsequently reduces gliomagenesis. Collectively , we conclude that nuclear-Smad6 enhances glioma development by inducing PIAS3 degradation and subsequent STAT3 activity upregulation.
