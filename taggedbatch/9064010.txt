 In this paper , we will present a case of a 63-year-old female with bifrontal epidermoid tumor who has gone under bilateral craniotomy. In a case report study , a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of progressive<symptom> headache<symptom> that has been admitted to Department of Neurosurgery was studied. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed for better evaluation. After detection of bifrontal epidermoid cyst<symptom> , the patient underwent surgery , and following the surgery , a cut of the tumor has been excised , sent for pathology sampling and reviewed for detection of cyst<symptom>. Microscopic review of the resected part reported normal brain tissue along with sections containing parts of cyst<symptom> wall covered by squamous epithelium and huge amount of irregularly stratified keratin within its lumen , which clearly emphasizes on diagnosis of a typical epidermoid tumor. Bifrontal epidermoid cyst<symptom> is rare , and according to our study , the clinical symptoms and patients imaging were consistent with other studies.
