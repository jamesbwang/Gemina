 Lung cancer is the number one cancer in terms of both mortality and incidence. Cancer cells differ from normal cells in that they can reprogram their metabolism to support a rapid proliferation rate and alter oxidative phosphorylation processes toward lactic acid fermentation , even under aerobic conditions. Therefore , we aimed to identify new compounds that might act as pyruvate kinase M2 isoform ( PKM2) activators and to investigate their anti-cancer efficacy in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) cells. The molecular docking method was applied to screen PKM2 activators from our virtual natural products library. Then , compounds with promising docking scores were examined for cytotoxic effects in a panel of NSCLC cells using the MTT assay. Functional effects and therapeutic mechanisms were investigated by in vitro enzyme assays , western blotting ( WB) , and flow cytometry. Molecular docking showed that 0089-0022 acts as a potential PKM2 activator by binding to the kinase pocket. An in vitro enzyme activity assay showed that 0089-0022 is a direct PKM2 activator and that it effectively induces apoptosis in A549 and H1975 cells through inhibition of AKT phosphorylation. Our results suggest that 0089-0022 activates PKM2 and thus is a promising anti-cancer therapeutic candidate in NSCLC.
