 Tranexamic acid ( TXA) is one of the debated therapies in the management of traumatic brain injury ( TBI). We conducted this study to evaluate the benefits of TXA in TBI on the mortality and its safety in these patients. This was a prospective randomized open-label trial including all patients , aged at 18 years or older , hospitalized in the emergency room during a 13-month period , for TBI. After the realization of the body CT scan , the patients were included if they had intracranial bleeding , and were then randomized according to their medical file number to receive or not the TXA. The eligibility criteria were based on the uncertainty principle , patients with significant extracranial bleeding were excluded since there was evidence that TXA improve their outcome. We enrolled 180 patients aged at 42 Â± 20 years , with an 88 % men-proportion. Subarachnoid haemorrhage was the most frequent lesion<symptom> in the brain CT-scan ( 67.5 %). After randomization , 96 patients were in the TXA group ( 53 %). Demographic data , clinical , biological and radiological features were statistically comparable in the two groups of patients ( ` TXA ' and ` noTXA '). The needs of transfusion or neurosurgery , the mortality rate , the in-hospital length of stay and the dependency at 28-post-traumatic day were similar in the two groups of patients. However , pulmonary embolism was statistically more frequent in ` TXA ' group ( 11.5 versus 2.4 % , p = 0.02). TXA is an interesting treatment in haemorrhagic shock<symptom>. Its efficiency in head trauma is still debated and controversial. Its impact on the mortality and the needs of transfusion or surgery were not demonstrated in this study. Nevertheless , its safety worth to be studied in larger samples as we found a higher rate of pulmonary embolism in the treated group.
