 Harmful algal blooms ( HAB) release microtoxins that contaminate drinking water supplies and risk the health of millions annually. Crystalline ferrate ( VI) is a powerful oxidant capable of removing algal microtoxins. We investigate in-situ electrochemically produced ferrate from common carbon steel as an on-demand alternative to crystalline ferrate for the removal of microcystin-LR ( MC-LR) and compare the removal efficacy for both electrochemical ( EC) and chemical dosing methodologies. We report that a very low dose of EC-ferrate in deionized water ( 0.5 mg FeO
