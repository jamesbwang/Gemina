 Exploiting high-efficiency and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER) and oxygen evolution reaction ( OER) has been actively encouraged because of their potential applications in the field of clean energy. In this paper , we reported a novel electrocatalyst based on an exfoliated two-dimensional ( 2D) MXene ( Ti
