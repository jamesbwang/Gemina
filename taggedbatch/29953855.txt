 We previously identified a set of the most frequently mutated cytoskeleton- and extracellular matrix-related proteins ( CECMPs) in numerous cancer datasets. In this report , we used a bioinformatics approach to assess the impact of amino acid ( AA) substitutions on the sensitivity of CECMPs to the ST14 protease ( matriptase I) , a transmembrane serine protease previously implicated in cancer development. Results indicated that AA substitutions in glioblastoma multiforme<pathogen> ( GBM) CECMPs are skewed toward increased resistance to the ST14 protease , in comparison to the wild-type peptide sequence. Furthermore , the protease resistant AA substitutions represent relatively high binding affinities to HLA class I proteins , when assessing the binding specificities using HLA class I alleles matched to the source of the mutant AA. Moreover , samples representing AA substitutions that increased protease sensitivity also represented reduced overall and disease-free survival periods for patients with glioblastoma. To assess tumor specimen immunogenicity , we identified T-cell receptor ( TCR) V ( D) J recombinations in GBM exome files. The overlap between ST14 protease sensitive mutant barcodes and the TCR V ( D) J recombination read positive barcodes represented significantly reduced survival.
