 Domoic acid ( DA) is a neurotoxin generated by several diatom species in harmful algae<pathogen> blooms ( HABs). We report the photo-induced transformation products ( TPs) and degradation mechanisms of DA in dissolved organic matter ( DOM)- rich freshwater and brackish water. High-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( QTOF-MS) and the multivariate statistical strategy orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis ( OPLS-DA) identified 36 and 23 potential TPs in DOM-rich freshwater and brackish water , respectively. The main reactive sites of DA are the conjugated double bond and proline ring. Isomerization is the predominant transformation pathway induced by excited-state triplet DOM (
