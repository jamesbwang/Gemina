 To determine whether laparoscopic surgery can be used in high-risk patients with gastric cancer. The clinicopathological data of 3743 patients with primary gastric adenocarcinoma , collected from January 2007 to December 2014 , were retrospectively analyzed. Patients who had ≥ 1 of the following conditions were defined as high-risk patients: ( 1) age ≥ 80 years; ( 2) BMI ≥ 30 kg/m A total of 1296 patients were included in PSM. After PSM , no significant difference in clinicopathological data was observed between the LG group ( n = 341) and the OG group ( n = 341). The operative time ( 181.70 vs. 266.71 min , p < 0.001) and blood<symptom> loss<symptom> during the operation ( 68.11 vs. 225.54 ml , p < 0.001) in the LG group were significantly lower than those in the OG group. In the LG and OG groups , postoperative complications occurred in 39 ( 11.4 %) and 63 ( 18.5 %) patients , respectively , p = 0.010. Multivariate analysis showed that laparoscopic surgery was an independent protective factor against postoperative complications ( p = 0.019). The number of risk factors was an independent risk factor for postoperative complications ( p = 0.021). The 5-year overall survival rate in the LG group was comparable to that in the OG group ( 55.0 vs. 52.0 % , p = 0.086). Hierarchical analysis further confirmed that the LG and OG groups exhibited comparable survival rates among patients with stages cI , pI , cII , pII , cIII , and pIII ( all p > 0.05). For high-risk patients with gastric cancer , LG not only exhibits better short-term efficacy than OG but also has a comparable 5-year survival rate to OG.
