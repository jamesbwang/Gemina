 Neisseria<pathogen> gonorrhoeae<pathogen> ( NG) has developed resistance to a wide range of antimicrobials. Population level data is essential to determine empiric treatment regimes. We sought to identify antimicrobial resistance patterns for NG in the Auckland region from 2008-2016 , and review the utility of current methods of antimicrobial resistance testing. Antimicrobial susceptibilities and demographic data from NG isolates derived from patients attending the Auckland Regional Sexual Health Service and Auckland City Hospital were analysed to determine resistance rates and trends over time. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by agar dilution using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI) interpretation criteria. Results for 2,302 isolates from 1,941 patients were analysed. While ciprofloxacin resistance increased between 2008 and 2011 , resistance rates for all antibiotics declined from 2013-2016. In 2016 , 22 % ( 53) of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin , 7 % ( 17) to penicillin , 31 % ( 76) to tetracycline and 0.8 % ( 2) exhibited decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone is still suitable as a component of gonorrhoea<disease> treatment in our region but resistance to other agents prohibits their use for empiric treatment regimens. Current methods of detecting antimicrobial resistance for NG needed to be updated so that they are fit for purpose.
