 The phenomenon of vanishing carcinomas , first described in context of prostatic carcinomas , has been documented in endometrial carcinomas as well. The archives of the department were searched for case files of endometrial carcinoma diagnosed on endometrial curetting/biopsy but which did not reveal any cancer on the subsequent hysterectomy specimen. Clinical and pathological correlation was established. A total of 5 cases were retrieved with biopsy-diagnosed endometrial carcinomas , 4 endometrioid and 1 serous type , which on subsequent hysterectomies did not reveal any tumor. These 5 cases represented 1.56 % of total hysterectomies in our series. All were Stage Ia tumors , which on follow-up ( mean = 18.2 months) did not show any local reoccurrence. Adjuvant therapy was instituted in 1 case in the form of pelvic irradiation in view of the serous histology. In all cases , the primary diagnosis was reconfirmed and any remote possibility of incorrect patient identification , laboratory errors , and institution of hormonal therapy were adequately ruled out along with an extensive endometrial sampling in hysterectomy. The recognition of `` vanishing endometrial carcinoma '' as a distinct entity is of utmost importance to avoid mislabeling them as medical errors.
