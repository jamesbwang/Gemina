 Fractured teeth with both enamel and dentin involvement might be treated with adhesive composite resin restorations. In cases where a perfect color match between the composite restoration and the remaining tooth structure is not achieved , a repair might be carried out to correct the color of restoration. This procedure avoids the restoration replacement , preserving tooth structure without compromising the esthetic outcome.
