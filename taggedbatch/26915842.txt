 The aim was to study the expectations of improvement in life and health following kidney transplantation ( KTx) in a population of wait-listed patients â‰¥ 65 years with end-stage kidney disease. Qualitative research with individual in-depth interviews. Patients on dialysis enlisted for a KTx from a deceased donor were included from an ongoing study of older patients ' perspectives on KTx. Qualitative face-to-face interviews were conducted in a safe and familiar setting , and were analysed thematically using the theoretical framework of lifespan. Fifteen patients ( median age 70 years , range 65-82) from all parts of Norway were interviewed. Informants were included consecutively until no new information was gained. Two main themes were evident: receiving a kidney is getting life back and grasp the chance. In addition , the themes ` hard to loose capacity and strength ' , ` reduced freedom ' and ` life on hold ' described the actual situation and thereby illuminated the informants ' expectations. The informants tried to balance positive expectations and realism towards KTx , and they were hoping to become free from dialysis and to live a normal life. This study shows that older KTx candidates comprise a heterogeneous group of patients who take individual approaches that allow them to maintain autonomy and control while waiting for a transplant. This study provides new knowledge about the older KTx candidates relevant for clinicians , patients and researchers.
