 Recent studies have shown that similar host glycan antigens are expressed by helminths such as Hydatid cyst<symptom> wall antigens were used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western immunoblotting and probed with pooled sera of hydatidosis patients and healthy controls. Sodium metaperiodate treatment was used to investigate glycan antigens. A band with molecular weight about 53 KDa reacted with both hydatid patients ' sera and also normal human sera. It has been shown that this band was a glycan antigen. A 53 KDa glycan antigen of hydatid cyst<symptom> wall that reacted with all human sera may have an important role for evasion from host immune system.
