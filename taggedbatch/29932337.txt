 Studying the accumulation position and forms of heavy metals ( HMs) in organisms and cells is helpful to understand the transport process and detoxification mechanism. As typical HMs , lead ( Pb) subcellular content , localization , and speciation of corn subcellular fractions were studied by a series of technologies , including transmission electron microscopy , inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry , and X-ray absorption near edge structure. The results revealed that the electrodense granules of Pb were localized in the cell wall , intercellular space , and plasma membranes<symptom>. About 71 % Pb was localized at the cell wall and soluble fraction. In cell walls , the total amount of pyromorphite and Pb carbonate was about 80 % and the remaining was Pb stearate. In the nuclear and chloroplast fraction , which demonstrated significant changes , major speciations were Pb sulfide ( 72 %) , basic Pb carbonate ( 16 %) , and Pb stearate ( 12 %). Pb is blocked by cell walls as pyromorphite and Pb carbonate sediments and compartmentalized by vacuoles , which both play an inportant role in cell detoxification. Besides , sulfur-containing compounds form inside the cells.
