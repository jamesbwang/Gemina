 Antimicrobial study of biofunctionalized silver nanoparticles has been done with the emphasis on its mechanism on both gram positive and negative bacteria. The biofunctionalized silver nanoparticles are employed considering their importance in green chemistry with respect to easy synthesis , usefulness , and economic synthetic procedure involved. The stability of these nanoparticles was determined by zeta potential analyzer. The probable mechanism of antibacterial activity was performed on
