 Various health benefits of carotenoids have been described. However , while human observational studies generally suggest positive health effects , supplementation with relatively high doses of individual carotenoids ( supplements) have partly produced adverse effects. In the present study , we investigated the effect of several carotenoids on the proteomic response of male Mongolian gerbils ( aged 6 weeks). Five groups of gerbils ( n = 6 per group) received either retinol ( vitamin A/53 mg per kg bw) , all-trans β-carotene ( pro-vitamin A/100 mg kg-1) , the non-pro vitamin A carotenoid lutein ( 100 mg kg-1) , the acyclic carotenoid lycopene ( 100 mg kg-1) or vehicle ( Cremophor EL) , via oral single gavage. Gerbils were 12 h post-prandially sacrificed and blood plasma , liver , and white adipose tissue were collected. For liver and adipose tissue , a 2D-DIGE ( difference gel electrophoresis) approach was conducted; for plasma , proteomic analyses were achieved by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Compared to controls ( vehicle) , various proteins were showing significant abundance variations in plasma ( 66) , liver ( 29) and adipose tissue ( 19) , especially regarding structure ( 22) , protein metabolism ( 15) and immune system/inflammation ( 19) functions , while proteins related to antioxidant effects were generally less abundant , suggesting no in vivo relevance. Surprisingly , a large overlap in protein regulation was found between lycopene and retinol exposure , while other carotenoids , including all-trans β-carotene , did not show this overlap. Mainly retinoid acid receptor co-regulated proteins may mechanistically explain this overlapping regulation. This overlapping regulation may be related to common nuclear hormone receptor mediated signalling , though further studies using synthetic ligands of retinoid receptors targeting protein regulation are needed for confirmation.
