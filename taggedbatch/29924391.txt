 Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a rare disease associated with high mortality and morbidity. Antenatal ultrasound screening identifies more than 70 % of cases , providing the opportunity for in utero referral to a tertiary care center for expert assessment and perinatal management. Additional genetic and morphologic assessment may be used to rule out associated anomalies. In isolated cases , the outcome may be predicted prenatally by medical imaging. The combination of lung size and liver herniation is a widely accepted method to stratify fetuses into groups with an increasing degree of pulmonary hypoplasia and corresponding mortality rates. Ultrasound measurement of the observed to expected lung-to-head ratio ( o/e LHR) is most widely used. The o/e LHR is an independent predictor of survival and short-term morbidity. Finally , evaluation of stomach position has recently been introduced as an indirect method to estimate severity of the disease in left-sided defects , as it has been shown to correlate with the proportion of intrathoracic liver. Herein , we propose a protocol for the standardized ultrasound assessment of fetuses with isolated CDH and individualized prediction of neonatal outcome.
