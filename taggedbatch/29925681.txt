 Inflammation<symptom> accompanies heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and is a mediator of cardiac fibrosis<disease>. CaMKIIδ plays an essential role in adverse remodeling and decompensation to heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. We postulated that inflammation<symptom> is the mechanism by which CaMKIIδ contributes to adverse remodeling in response to nonischemic interventions. We demonstrate that deletion of CaMKIIδ in the cardiomyocyte ( CKO) significantly attenuates activation of NF-κB , expression of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines , and macrophage accumulation induced by angiotensin II ( Ang II) infusion. The inflammasome was activated by Ang II , and this response was also diminished in CKO mice. These events occurred prior to any evidence of Ang II-induced cell death. In addition , CaMKII-dependent inflammatory gene expression and inflammasome priming were observed as early as the third hour of infusion , a time point at which macrophage recruitment was not evident. Inhibition of either the inflammasome or monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP1) signaling attenuated macrophage accumulation , and these interventions , like cardiomyocyte CaMKIIδ deletion , diminished the fibrotic response to Ang II. Thus , activation of CaMKIIδ in the cardiomyocyte represents what we believe to be a novel mechanism for initiating inflammasome activation and an inflammatory gene program that leads to macrophage recruitment and ultimately to development of fibrosis<disease>.
