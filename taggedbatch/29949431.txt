 ( 1) Review the anatomy and epidemiology of ectopic parathyroid adenomas ( EPAs) , ( 2) summarize the role of relevant imaging modalities in the localization of EPAs , and ( 3) characterize surgical approaches for various ectopic locations. Literature review of published English-language articles from 1995 through August 2017. Summary of the literature indicates that the prevalence of EPA is approximately 20 % in unexplored patients with primary hyperparathyroidism , but it is as high as 66 % in re-operative patients. EPAs may be located anywhere from the carotid bifurcation to the aorto-pulmonary window. Ultrasound has limited accuracy in identifying EPAs except near the thyroid and thyrothymic ligament and requires expert experience from the user. Among dual-phase EPAs pose challenges during both localization and surgical removal. High-volume experience and multidisciplinary care are necessary for optimal outcomes. CT = computed tomography; 4DCT = 4-dimensional CT; EPA = ectopic parathyroid adenoma; EPG = ectopic parathyroid gland; PHPT = primary hyperparathyroidism; RLN = recurrent laryngeal nerve; SPECT = single-photon emission computed tomography; TE = tracheo-esophageal.
