 Cell phones are susceptible to bacterial contamination. The aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial isolates and to explore their dispersion in five Intensive Care Units ( ICUs) over the time. We performed a secondary analysis of non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive cocci isolated from a 5-month observational cohort study developed among health care workers ' cell phones in five ICUs. Cell phones were sampled using a swab every 15 days. Antimicrobial resistance was determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration method. We constructed resistance phenotypes to group the isolates according to species and antimicrobial resistance pattern to explore dispersion through time. A total of 35 Cell phones are contaminated with highly harmful bacteria and potentially can maintain them for prolonged periods of time. These devices could be considered as a potential source of nosocomial infections in ICUs.
