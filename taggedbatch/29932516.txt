 Obesity and depression<symptom> frequently co-occur , and each increases risk for cardiovascular disease ( CVD). This study tested whether a combined treatment , targeting obesity and depression<symptom> simultaneously , would yield greater improvements in weight , mood , and CVD risk factors than treatments that targeted each disease individually. Seventy-six participants with obesity and major depression<symptom> were randomly assigned to ( 1) behavioral weight control ( BWC) , ( 2) cognitive behavioral therapy for depression<symptom> ( CBT-D) , or ( 3) BWC combined with CBT-D. Participants were provided 18 group treatment sessions over 20 weeks. Mood , weight , and CVD risk were assessed at baseline and weeks 8 and 20 , with a follow-up visit at week 46. At week 20 , participants in combined treatment lost significantly ( P < 0.02) more weight ( 5.2 % ± 1.2 %) than those assigned to CBT-D ( 0.8 % ± 1.3 %) and comparable amounts as those in BWC ( 3.5 % ± 1.3 %). Depression<symptom> scores decreased significantly from baseline levels in each group , with no significant differences between groups. All three groups showed significant improvements in 10-year CVD risk , with no significant differences between groups. Groups did not differ significantly on any of these measures at week 46. BWC yielded short-term improvements in weight , mood , and CVD risk , comparable to a combined treatment that incorporated CBT-D. Results require replication with a larger sample size.
