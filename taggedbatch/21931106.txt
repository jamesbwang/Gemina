 Detecting and treating dementia at an early stage are important. Although the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale ( HDS-R) is commonly used to detect dementia , it takes about 10 min to complete. In contrast , the 1-min animal test ( OMAT) takes only 1 min to complete and may be a helpful screening test for general practitioners in deciding whether to proceed with administering further diagnostic tests such as the HDS-R. We sought to examine the relationship between the OMAT and HDS-R scores , and determine the cut-off OMAT score that balanced the sensitivity and specificity in identifying HDS-R-positive patients. A total of 122 consecutive patients with diabetes who visited the outpatient clinic at the Fujiidera Municipal Hospital were enrolled. The patients underwent the OMAT and HDS-R on the same day. Tests were conducted in a single-blinded manner. The relationship between the OMAT and HDS-R scores was examined using Spearman 's rank correlation. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to identify the optimal cut-off score of OMAT that will determine whether to proceed with further diagnostic tests. A strong positive correlation between the OMAT and HDS-R scores was observed ( r = 0.70). The sensitivity and specificity of OMAT using cut-off scores of 12/13 , 13/14 , and 14/15 for HDS-R-positive patients were 0.87 and 0.66 , 1.00 and 0.51 , and 1.00 and 0.40 , respectively among all the subjects. Similar results were obtained in a subgroup of subjects aged ≥ 65 years. A cut-off score of 13/14 on the OMAT balanced the sensitivity closest to 1.00 and allowed for the highest specificity for the HDS-R not only among all the patients , but also among just the patients aged ≥ 65 years. The OMAT may be an optimal screening test to determine whether to proceed with further diagnosis using HDS-R.
