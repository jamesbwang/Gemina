 Fibroblasts play an important role in lung homeostasis and disease. In lung<disease> fibrosis<disease> , fibroblasts adopt a proliferative and migratory phenotype , with increased expression of α-smooth muscle actin ( αSMA) and enhanced secretion of extracellular matrix components. Comprehensive profiling of fibroblast heterogeneity is limited , due to a lack of specific cell-surface markers. We have previously profiled the surface proteome of primary human lung fibroblasts. Here , we sought to define and quantify a panel of cluster of differentiation markers in primary human lung fibroblasts and IPF lung tissue , using immunofluorescence and FACS analysis. Fibroblast function was assessed by analysis of replicative senescence. We observed presence of distinct fibroblast phenotypes in vivo , characterized by various combinations of Desmin , αSMA , CD36 , or CD97 expression. Most markers demonstrated stable expression over passages in vitro , but significant changes were observed for CD36 , CD54 , CD82 , CD106 , and CD140a. Replicative senescence of fibroblasts was observed from passage 10 onward. CD36- and CD97-positive , but αSMA-negative , cells were present in remodeled areas of IPF lungs. Transforming growth factor-β treatment induced αSMA and collagen I expression , but repressed CD36- and CD97 expression. We identified a panel of stable surface markers in human lung fibroblasts , applicable for positive cell isolation directly from lung tissue. TGF-β exposure represses CD36- and CD97 expression , while increasing αSMA expression; we therefore identified complex surface protein changes during fibroblast-myofibroblast activation. Co-existence of quiescence and activated fibroblast subtypes in the IPF lung suggests dynamic remodeling of fibroblast activation upon subtle changes to growth factor exposure in local microenvironmental niches.
