 The direct cyanomethylation of indoles at the 2- or 3-position was achieved via photoredox catalysis. The versatile nitrile synthon is introduced as a radical generated from bromoacetonitrile , a photocatalyst , and blue LED as a light source. The mechanism of the reaction is explored by determination of the Stern-Volmer quenching constants. By combining photophysical data and mass spectrometry to follow the catalyst decomposition , the catalyst ligands were tuned to enable synthetically useful yields of radical coupling products. A range of indole substrates with alkyl , aryl , halogen , ester , and ether functional groups participate in the reaction , affording products in 16-90 % yields. The reaction allows the rapid construction of synthetically useful cyanomethylindoles , products that otherwise require several synthetic steps.
