 OBJECTIVE To determine antinociceptive efficacy , behavioral patterns , and respiratory effects associated with dexmedetomidine administration in ball pythons ( Python regius). ANIMALS 12 ball pythons. PROCEDURES Antinociception was assessed by applying an infrared heat stimulus to the cranioventral surface of snakes during 2 experiments. Thermal withdrawal latency was measured at 0 , 2 , and 24 hours after SC injections of dexmedetomidine ( 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg) or saline ( 0.9 % NaCl) solution and at 0 to 60 minutes after injection of dexmedetomidine ( 0.1 mg/kg) or saline solution. Behaviors were recorded at 0 , 2 , and 24 hours after administration of dexmedetomidine ( 0.1 mg/kg) or saline solution. Tongue flicking , head flinch to the approach of an observer 's hand , movement , and righting reflex were scored. Respiratory frequency was measured by use of plethysmography to detect breathing-related movements after injection of dexmedetomidine ( 0.1 mg/kg) or saline solution. RESULTS Mean baseline withdrawal latency was 5 to 7 seconds; saline solution did not alter withdrawal latency. Dexmedetomidine increased withdrawal latency by 18 seconds ( 0.2 mg/kg) and 13 seconds ( 0.1 mg/kg) above baseline values at 2 hours. Increased withdrawal latency was detected within 15 minutes after dexmedetomidine administration. At 2 hours after injection , there were few differences in behavioral scores. Dexmedetomidine injection depressed respiratory frequency by 55 % to 70 % , compared with results for saline solution , but snakes continued to breathe without prolonged apnea. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Dexmedetomidine increased noxious thermal withdrawal latency without causing excessive sedation. Therefore , dexmedetomidine may be a useful analgesic drug in ball pythons and other snake species.
