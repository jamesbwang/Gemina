 This study aims to quantitatively compare T2 * measurements of the talar cartilage between chronic lateral ankle instability ( LAI) patients with lateral ligament injury and healthy volunteers , and to assess the association of T2 * value with American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ( AOFAS) score. Nineteen consecutive patients with chronic LAI ( LAI group) and 19 healthy individuals ( control group) were enrolled. Biochemical magnetic resonance examination of the ankle was performed in all participants using three-dimensional gradient-echo T2 * mapping. Total talar cartilage was divided into six subcompartments , including medial anterior ( MA) , central medial , medial posterior , lateral anterior , central lateral ( LC) , and lateral posterior regions. T2 * values of respective cartilage areas were measured and compared between the two groups using Student t test. AOFAS scoring was performed for clinical evaluation. Then , the association of T2 * value with AOFAS score was evaluated by Pearson correlation. The T2 * values of total talar cartilage , as well as MA and LC cartilage compartments , in the chronic LAI group were significantly higher than control values ( P < .001 , P = .039 , and P = .014 , respectively). Furthermore , the T2 * value of MA in the chronic LAI group was negatively correlated with AOFAS score ( r = -0.8089 , P < .001). Chronic LAI with lateral ligament injury may have a causal connection with early cartilage degeneration in the ankle joint , especially in MA and LC cartilage compartments , as assessed by quantitative T2 * measurements. The clinical score correlates highly with T2 * value of the MA cartilage compartment , indicating that MA may be the principal cartilage area conferring clinical symptoms.
