 The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to estimate the association between the two SNPs and PCa risk. Medline , Embase , Scopus , PubMed , Web of Science , Wan Fang Database and Chinese Zhi Wang Database were searched for the association of the two SNPs with susceptibility to PCa. The effect size was pooled by odds ratios ( ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CIs). Nine case-control studies , 5 on rs3787016 and 4 on rs2910164 , were included. As regards rs3787016 , an increased risk of PCa was identified in all genotype models ( T versus C: OR = 1.18 , 95 % CI 1.11-1.25; CT versus CC: OR = 1.17 , 95 % CI 1.08-1.26; TT versus CC: OR = 1.41 , 95 % CI 1.22-1.63; TT + CT versus CC: OR = 1.20 , 95 % CI 1.12-1.30; TT versus CT + CC: OR = 1.32 , 95 % CI 1.15-1.52). However , no significant association was found between rs2910164 and PCa risk in any genetic models , in fact a trend of reduced risk could be seen ( C versus G: OR = 0.91 , 95 % CI 0.79-1.05; GC versus GG: OR = 0.93 , 95 % CI 0.74-1.18; CC versus GG: OR = 0.70 , 95 % CI 0.47-1.02; CC + GC versus GG: OR = 0.90 , 95 % CI 0.73-1.12; CC versus GC + GG: OR = 0.78 , 95 % CI 0.56-1.08). Besides , in analysis of subgroups by source of controls , the decreased results were observed in studies using population-based controls. lncRNA
