 To evaluate the association of 12 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms ( tagSNPs) in three onco-long non-coding RNA ( lncRNA) genes ( Twelve tagSNPs covering the three onco-lncRNAs were genotyped by the KASP method in a total of 1338 samples , including 521 HCC patients and frequency-matched 817 controls. The samples were obtained from an unrelated Chinese population at the First Hospital of China Medical University from 2012-2015. The expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTL) analyses were conducted to explore further the potential function of the promising SNPs. Three SNPs in Specific lncRNA (
