 A wealth of literature has examined the association between breastfeeding and the development of cognitive abilities in childhood. In particular , at least some evidence exists suggesting that breastfed children perform better on measures of intelligence later in life. Although a correlation appears to be present , fewer observational studies have included appropriate adjustment for potentially confounding variables; maternal intelligence , maternal education , and cognitive stimulation provided by mothers being chief among them. As a result , we analyze a national sample of approximately 790 American respondents to test the association between breastfeeding and intelligence during childhood and adolescence using multiple intelligence tests and controlling for a range of key covariates. Our results suggest that the correlation between breastfeeding throughout the first six months of life and intelligence is statistically significant and consistent , yet of substantively minor impact.
