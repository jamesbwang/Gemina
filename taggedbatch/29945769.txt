 We previously showed that nicotine evoked kinetic tremor<symptom> by activating the inferior olive , which is implicated in the pathogenesis of essential tremor<symptom> , via Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Here , we evaluated the effects of various anti-tremor and anti-epileptic agents on nicotine-induced tremor<symptom> in mice to clarify the pharmacological characteristics of nicotine tremor<symptom>. Drugs effective for essential tremor<symptom> , propranolol , diazepam and phenobarbital , all significantly inhibited kinetic tremor<symptom> induced by an intraperitoneal ( i.p.) injection of nicotine ( 1 mg/kg). In contrast , none of the medications for Parkinson 's disease , l-DOPA , bromocriptine or trihexyphenidyl , affected the nicotine tremor<symptom>. Among the anti-epileptic agents examined , valproate , carbamazepine and ethosuximide , significantly inhibited nicotine-induced tremor<symptom>. In addition , a selective T-type Ca
