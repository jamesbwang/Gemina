 Quercetin ( QCT) has been known as a potential therapeutic strategy for gastrointestinal diseases because it contributes to the stabilization of mast cells , the prevention of histamine release and modulation of CaCC chloride channel. We investigated the laxative effect and action mechanism of QCT in Lop-induced constipation<symptom> model. Constipation<symptom> of SD rats was induced by subcutaneous injection of loperamide ( Lop) ( 4 mg/kg weight) in 0.5 % Tween 20 twice a day for three days. After 24 h , the constipation<symptom> group was further treated with 1 Ã— PBS ( Lop + Vehicle treated group) , 10 mg/kg of QCT ( Lop + LQCT treated group) , 20 mg/kg of QCT ( Lop + MQCT treated group) or 40 mg/kg QCT ( Lop + HQCT treated group) at once. At 24 h after QCT treatment , the constipation<symptom> phenotypes were measured and the transverse colon was collected from SD rats. The gastrointestinal motility , the number of stools<symptom> and histological structures were significantly recovered in Lop + QCT treated group compared with the Lop + Vehicle treated group. Also , above activity of epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells were regulated by the mRNA expression of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M2 and M3 ( mAChR M2 and M3) and some mediators of their downstream signalling pathway. Finally , laxative effects of QCT on mAChR signalling pathway were significantly inhibited by the treatment of mAChR antagonist in primary smooth muscle of rat intestine cells ( pRISMCs). This study provides the first strong evidence that QCT can be considered an important candidate for improving chronic constipation<symptom> induced by Lop treatment in animal models.
