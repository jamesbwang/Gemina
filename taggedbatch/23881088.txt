 We have previously shown that epidural dexmedetomidine , when used as an adjunct to levobupivacaine for control of postoperative pain after open colonic resection , improves recovery of gastrointestinal motility compared with morphine. Sixty patients undergoing laparoscopic colonic resection were enrolled and allocated randomly to treatment with dexmedetomidine ( group D) or morphine ( group M). Group D received an epidural loading dose of dexmedetomidine ( 5 mL , 0.5 μg/kg) , followed by continuous epidural administration of dexmedetomidine ( 80 μg) in 0.125 % levobupivacaine ( 240 mL) at a rate of 5 mL/h for 2 days. Group M received an epidural loading dose of morphine ( 5 mL , 0.03 mg/kg) followed by continuous epidural administration of morphine ( 4.5 mg) in 0.125 % levobupivacaine ( 240 mL) at a rate of 5 mL/h for 2 days. Verbal rating score ( VRS) of pain , postoperative analgesic requirements , side effects related to analgesia , and time to postoperative first flatus ( FFL) and first feces ( FFE) were recorded. VRS and postoperative analgesic requirements were not significantly different between the treatment groups. In contrast , FFL and FFE were significant delayed in group M compared with group D ( P < .05). Patients in group M also had a significantly higher incidence of nausea<symptom> , vomiting , and pruritus ( P < .05). No neurological deficits were observed in either group. Compared with morphine , epidural dexmedetomidine is a better adjunct to levobupivacaine for control of postoperative pain after laparoscopic colonic resection.
