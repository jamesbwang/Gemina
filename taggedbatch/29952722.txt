 Human skin is one of the most important organs in the human body since its main role is to protect the body against deleterious external factors such as ultraviolet ( UV) light , trauma , microorganisms and chemicals. It is composed of three layers: the hypodermis , dermis and epidermis ( Figure 1). The epidermis , which is the external layer , is a keratinized pluristratified epithelium composed of keratinocytes ( 90 %) , melanocytes ( 5 %) in the basal layer , Merkel cells and Langerhans cells. The dermis is a connective tissue that supports and nourishes the epidermis since the latter is not vascularized. It is mainly composed of elastin and fibrillar collagen I and III , whose levels vary with age. The dermo-epidermal junction secreted by keratinocytes and by fibroblasts contains collagen IV and VII and ensures the cohesion of the epidermis and dermis. The hypodermis is a loose connective tissue mainly composed of adipocytes and connected to the dermis by collagen fibers and elastin.
