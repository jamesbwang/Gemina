 Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation elicit lasting changes in gene expression and likely mediate gene-environment interactions that shape brain development , behavior , and emotional health. Myriad environmental factors influence DNA methylation , including methyl donor content in the paternal diet , could influence methylation in offspring via changes in the paternal germ line. The present study examines the effects of paternal methyl donor dietary deficiency on offspring 's emotional behaviors , including anxiety<symptom> , social interaction , and depression-like behavior. We previously found that rats bred to display high levels of anxiety<symptom>- and depression-like behavior exhibit diminished DNA methylation in the amygdala. We also observed that depleting dietary methyl donor content exacerbated the rats ' already high levels of anxiety<symptom>- and depression-like behavior. Here we sought to determine whether paternal dietary methyl donor depletion elicits intergenerational effects on first generation ( F1) offspring 's behavior ( potentially triggering a similar increase in anxiety<symptom>- and/or depression-like behavior). Thus , adult male rats prone to high anxiety/depression-like behavior , were fed either a methyl donor depleted ( DEP) or control ( CON) diet for 5 weeks prior to mating. They were paired with females and resultant F1 male offspring were subjected to a behavioral test battery in adulthood. F1-DEP offspring showed a similar behavioral profile to the F0 males , including greater depression-like behavior in the forced swim test ( FST) and increased anxiety-like behavior in the open field test ( OFT). Future work will interrogate molecular changes in the brains of F1 offspring that mediate these intergenerational effects of paternal methyl donor dietary content on offspring emotional behavior.
