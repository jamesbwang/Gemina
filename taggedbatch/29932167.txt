 In the present study , a scaffold-free tissue construct was developed as an approach for the regeneration of tissue defects , which produced good outcomes. We fabricated a scaffold-free tissue construct from human dental pulp stem cells ( hDPSCs construct) , and examined the characteristics of the construct. For its fabrication , basal sheets prepared by 4-week hDPSCs culturing were subjected to 1-week three-dimensional culture , with or without osteogenic induction , whereas hDPSC sheets ( control) were fabricated by 1-week culturing of basal sheets on monolayer culture. The hDPSC constructs formed a spherical structure and calcified matrix that are absent in the control. The expression levels for bone-related genes in the hDPSC constructs were significantly upregulated compared with those in the control. Moreover , the hDPSC constructs with osteogenic induction had a higher degree of calcified matrix formation , and higher expression levels for bone-related genes , than those for the hDPSC constructs without osteogenic induction. These results suggest that the hDPSC constructs with osteogenic induction are composed of cells and extracellular and calcified matrices , and that they can be a possible scaffold-free material for bone regeneration.
