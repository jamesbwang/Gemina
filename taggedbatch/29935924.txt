 Surgeons worldwide face unique time and practice pressures differentiating them from other types of physicians , specifically as clinician educators ( CEs). The purpose of this study is to identify and describe academic surgical clinician educators ( SCEs) in international graduate medical education systems , characterize their perceptions of roles , preparedness , and factors affecting job satisfaction and retention , as compared to nonsurgical international CEs. A cross-sectional survey of CEs was conducted June 2013-June 2014 at academic medical centers in Singapore , Qatar , and the United Arab Emirates that adopted competency-based graduate medical education and received accreditation by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-International. Two hundred seventy-six ( 76.3 %) of 359 eligible physicians responded; 64 ( 23.2 %) were SCEs. SCEs were predominantly male ( 80 %) , less than 50 years of age ( 83 %) , with 64 % having been in their current position less than 5 years. Overall , SCEs were significantly less confident , as compared to nonsurgical CEs , in aspects of educational programs , including curriculum development , assessment , and mentorship. SCEs spent significantly more time engaged in patient care activities , as compared to nonsurgeon colleagues. There were no significant differences between SCEs and nonsurgical CEs in terms of work-life balance<symptom> and satisfaction with responsibilities , position , or potential promotion , with most SCEs intending to stay in academic medicine. Academic SCEs working in the international programs reported overall job satisfaction with a desire to remain in academic medicine. However , SCEs have several faculty development needs. International surgical training programs can develop and expand offerings in teaching and education to improve skills and maintain SCE satisfaction and retention , necessary to successfully train the next generation of surgeons.
