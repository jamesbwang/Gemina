 The hematopoietic system plays a critical role in establishing the proper response against invading pathogens or in removing cancerous cells. Furthermore , deregulations of the hematopoietic differentiation program are at the origin of numerous diseases including leukemia<disease>. Importantly , many aspects of blood cell development have been conserved from human to Drosophila. Hence , Drosophila has emerged as a potent genetic model to study blood cell development and leukemia<disease> in vivo. In this chapter , we give a brief overview of the Drosophila hematopoietic system , and we provide a protocol for the dissection and the immunostaining of the larval lymph<symptom> gland , the most studied hematopoietic organ in Drosophila. We then focus on the various paradigms that have been used in fly to investigate how conserved genes implicated in leukemogenesis control blood cell development. Specific examples of Drosophila models for leukemia<disease> are presented , with particular attention to the most translational ones. Finally , we discuss some limitations and potential improvements of Drosophila models for studying blood cell cancer.
