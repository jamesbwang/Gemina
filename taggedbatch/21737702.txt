 Many broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bnAbs) bind to conserved areas of the hemagglutinin ( HA) stalk region and can inhibit the low pH induced HA conformational changes necessary for viral membrane fusion activity. We developed and evaluated a high-throughput virus-free and cell-free ELISA based low pH induced HA Conformational Change Inhibition Antibody Detection Assay ( HCCIA) and a complementary proteinase susceptibility assay. Human serum samples ( n = 150) were tested by HCCIA using H3 recombinant HA. Optical density ( OD) ratios of mAb HC31 at pH 4.8 to pH 7.0 ranged from 0.87 to 0.09. Our results demonstrated that low pH induced HA conformational change inhibition antibodies ( CCI) neutralized multiple H3 strains after removal of head-binding antibodies. The results suggest that HCCIA can be utilized to detect and characterize CCI in sera , that are potentially broadly neutralizing , and serves as a useful tool for evaluating universal vaccine candidates targeting the HA stalk.
