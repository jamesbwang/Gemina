 To explore the relationship between 16 symptom clusters ( SCs) , clinical and demographic influencing factors , and clinical outcomes over time in patients with pancreatic cancer ( PC) undergoing surgical resection. 143 patients with stage II PC undergoing surgical resection were recruited to participate in this longitudinal , exploratory study conducted at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital , a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. Quality of life was measured preoperatively and at three , six , and nine months postoperatively. Statistical methods included simple linear and Cox proportional hazard regression. Preoperative pain was significantly associated with the pain-gastrointestinal SC , and preoperative worry was significantly associated with the mood SC. The strongest negative association with emotional well-being across all study time points was found with the preoperative mood SC. The insomnia-digestive problems SC and the nutritional problems SC demonstrated a trend toward poor survival. Findings provide evidence that preoperative worry and pain are associated with SC severity and that SCs may have a detrimental effect on quality of life and survival in patients with PC undergoing surgical resection.
