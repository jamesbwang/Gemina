 In light of the modern surgical trend towards minimally invasive surgery , we aim to assess the feasibility of hand-assisted laparoscopic ( HAL) cytoreductive surgery ( CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC) in peritoneal surface malignancy ( PSM). Patients with PSM secondary to colorectal cancer or pseudomyxoma peritonei<pathogen> with peritoneal cancer index ( PCI) of â‰¤ 10 were considered for HAL CRS and HIPEC. One patient had PCI of 15 but based on the disease distribution laparoscopic-assisted CRS and HIPEC was thought to be feasible , thus was also included. These patients were compared to matched controls who underwent open CRS and HIPEC for similar pathologies. Matching was performed on age and PCI to reflect a comparable complexity of the operation , and tumor grade for comparable risk of disease recurrence. Eleven patients were included in each group. In both groups , mean PCI was 4.1 , mean age was 58.5 years , and 81.8 % were well-moderately differentiated tumors. Complete cytoreduction was achieved in all patients. Upon comparison , HAL patients had significantly less blood<symptom> loss<symptom> and 3-day shorter hospitalization. No difference was demonstrated in operative time , number of visceral resections , and rate of omentectomy/peritonectomy. Also , no difference was detected in morbidities and 30-day readmission rates. No intraperitoneal recurrences have been reported in the HAL group after a median follow-up of 11 months. HAL CRS and HIPEC is a feasible procedure and can be considered for PSM with low PCI. It offers very acceptable and comparable short-term outcomes to the conventional open approach.
