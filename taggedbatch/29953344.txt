 Fluorescence light microscopy is an indispensable approach for the investigation of cell biological mechanisms. With the development of cutting-edge tools such as genetically encoded fluorescent proteins and superresolution methods , light microscopy is more powerful than ever at providing insight into a broad range of phenomena , from bacterial fission to cancer metastasis. However , as with all experimental approaches , care must be taken to ensure reliable and reproducible data collection , analysis , and reporting. Each step of every imaging experiment , from design to execution to communication to data management , should be critically assessed for bias , rigor , and reproducibility. This Perspective provides a basic `` best practices '' guide for designing and executing fluorescence imaging experiments , with the goal of introducing researchers to concepts that will help empower them to acquire images with rigor.
