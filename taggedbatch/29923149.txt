 Recombinant Zymomonas mobilis ( pGEX-4T-3 BI 120-2) was constructed to encode endo-glucanase ( CelA) and endo-xylanase ( Xyn11) from Z. mobilis ZM4 ( ATCC 31821) and an uncultured bacterium<pathogen>. The recombinant was genetically engineered with the N-terminus of a predicted SecB-dependent ( type II) secretion signal from phoC of Z. mobilis to translocate the enzymes extracellularly. Both the enzymes were characterized regarding their functional optimum pH and temperature , with the highest multi-enzyme activities at pH 6.0 and a temperature of 30 Â°C , which approximates the optimum conditions for ethanol production by Z. mobilis. The crude intracellular and extracellular fractions of the recombinant were characterized in terms of substrate specificity using carboxymethyl cellulose ( CMC) , beechwood xylan , filter paper , Avicel , and pretreated rice straw. The crude extracellular and intracellular enzymes with cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities were more robustly produced and secreted from the recombinant strain compared to the wild-type and ampicillin-sensitive strains , using CMC and beechwood xylan as the substrates. Ethanol production by the recombinant strain was greater than the production by the wild-type strain when pretreated rice straw was used as a sole carbon source.
