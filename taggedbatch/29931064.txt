 Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> is a major fungal<disease> opportunistic pathogen for humans. In the treatment of C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> , azole drugs target the sterol 14Î±-demethylase ( CYP51) encoded by ERG11 gene. Most studies have focused on the fact that the ERG11 mutant results in drug resistance , but its mechanism of action as a drug target has not been described yet. Our results showed that deletion of ERG11 reduced filamentous and invasive growth , and impaired hyphal elongation in sensing serum. Lack of ERG11 increased susceptibility to H2O2 and was defective in clearing reactive oxygen species. ERG11 may affect oxidative stress adaptation by specifically downregulating CAT1 expression. In addition , C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> cells lacking ERG11 were more efficiently killed by macrophages and became avirulent in vivo. This study is the first to indicate that ERG11 plays an essential role in hyphal elongation , oxidative stress adaptation and virulence in C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen>. We speculated that azole drugs not only inhibit the growth of C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> , but also assist the host immune system in clearing the fungal organism. The new understanding of mechanisms of action of antifungal drugs should facilitate the development of treatment strategies for resistant fungal infections.
