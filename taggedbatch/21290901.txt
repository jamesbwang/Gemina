Of the selected studies for final inclusion in the systematic review , study quality was assessed using the critical appraisal worksheet for randomised controlled trials from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine ( CEBM 2005). Prevented fraction ( PF) , number needed to treat ( NNT) and relative risk ( RR) were calculated as outcome measures in each study. In addition , the published evidence on SDF was reviewed in order to formulate clinical recommendations on safety and effectiveness when treating root or coronal caries<disease> in an adult population with SDF , as well as treatment of dental hypersensitivity.ResultsThree randomised controlled trials were identified that addressed the effectiveness of SDF on root caries<disease> in older adults , but none addressed coronal caries<disease>. Root caries<disease> prevented fraction and arrest rate for SDF were significantly higher than placebo. The prevented fraction for caries<disease> prevention for SDF compared to placebo was 71 % in a three-year study and 25 % in a two-year study. The prevented fraction for caries<disease> arrest for SDF was 725 % greater in a 24-month study and 100 % greater than placebo in a 30-month study. No severe adverse effects were observed.ConclusionsExisting reports of SDF trials support effectiveness in root caries<disease> prevention and arrest , remineralisation of deep occlusal lesions<symptom> and treatment of hypersensitive dentine.
