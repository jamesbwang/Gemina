 We undertook a national survey to provide current information on antimicrobial resistance among Shigella<pathogen> isolated in New Zealand. Diagnostic laboratories are requested to refer all Shigella<pathogen> isolates to the Institute of Environmental Science and Research ( ESR) for epidemiological typing as part of the national surveillance of shigellosis<disease>. The antimicrobial susceptibility of 263 non-duplicate Shigella<pathogen> isolates referred to ESR in 2015 and 2016 was tested. The 263 Shigella<pathogen> comprised 141 ( 53.6 %) S.<pathogen> sonnei<pathogen> , 113 ( 43.0 %) S.<pathogen> flexneri<pathogen> , 7 ( 2.7 %) S.<pathogen> boydii<pathogen> and 2 ( 0.8 %) S.<pathogen> dysenteriae<pathogen>. Among the 141 S.<pathogen> sonnei<pathogen> , the majority were either biotype g ( 90) or biotype a ( 50). Rates of resistance to the two currently recommended first-line antibiotics , co-trimoxazole and fluoroquinolones<disease> , were relatively high at 56.7 % and 22.8 % , respectively. Azithromycin is considered a second-line treatment option , but 11.0 % of Shigella<pathogen> were categorised as having a non-wildtype ( NWT) azithromycin phenotype ( ie , having some mechanism of azithromycin resistance although not necessarily clinically resistant). There were several significant differences in resistance between the two most prevalent S.<pathogen> sonnei<pathogen> biotypes , with resistance being significantly more prevalent among biotype g isolates. Shigella<pathogen> from patients who had not travelled overseas were significantly more likely to be azithromycin NWT than isolates from patients who had recently travelled ( 20.7 vs 5.6 %). Azithromycin NWT was more prevalent among Shigella<pathogen> from males than females ( 13.9 vs 7.7 %). These results suggest there is an immediate need to revise the currently recommended first-line treatment for shigellosis<disease> , especially when treatment is given on an empirical basis. Equally concerning is the fact that resistance to the second-line antibiotic for shigellosis<disease> , azithromycin , appears to be emerging in New Zealand. As diagnostic laboratories increase their use of culture-independent testing , it is recommended that they should continue to culture specimens from all shigellosis<disease> cases so that isolates are available for susceptibility testing and epidemiological typing.
