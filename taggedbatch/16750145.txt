 Gestational diabetes increases the risk of congenital heart disease in the offspring , but the molecular mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. Therefore , the current study was conducted to assess the effects of induced gestational diabetes on expression of some involved genes in cardiac hypertrophy in the offspring of diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in 40 adult Wistar rats by intraperitoneal injection of 45 mg/kg of streptozotocin. The day of appearance of the vaginal plug was assumed as day zero of gestation for inducing diabetes. After pregnancy , the offspring was maintained until they reach the age of 12 weeks. Then , their hearts were excised and were sectioned for molecular study. We analyzed the expression pattern of some hypertrophic genes by the quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The mRNA expression levels of all studied genes including c-jun , c-fos , c-myc , alpha-myosin heavy chain ( α-MHC) , atrial natriuretic factor ( ANF) and β-MHC , which are important in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy , were higher in the offspring of the diabetic group compared to controls. Significant differences were found for β-MHC and c-myc with Gestational diabetes upregulates expression of c-jun , c-fos c-myc , α-MHC , ANF and β-MHC genes that are involved in cardiac hypertrophy in the offspring of diabetic rats.
