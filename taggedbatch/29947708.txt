 To evaluate the self-eye examination practice as a tool to promote the ocular self-evaluation. Quasi-experimental study developed in a university of Piauí with sample of 324 students between January and May 2014. A team of thirteen researchers made observations during the self-examination followed by an ocular screening. There was no agreement on the hypothesis of defense that the ocular exam could help to observe the eyes health , p-value > 0.3. However , the exam was considered as easy to accomplish ( 99.7 %) and that not only the physician can perform the eye exam ( 99.4 %). The awareness about eye care is identified as the main purpose of this booklet ( 97.6 %) , ( χ2 = 186.01; p = 0.001). The results highlight the booklet can be used in the teaching process of self-eye examination ( 84.6 %). Although the defense that its fulfilment can replace the consultation with the ophthalmologist ( 23.8 % %) can not be accepted ( χ2 = 46.34) , the self-exam must be done routinely ( 82.4 %). The results prove that the learning through virtual booklet is possible and supports self-care with the eyes by performing the self-exam.
