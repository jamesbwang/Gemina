 Hydroponic systems are a convenient platform for plant cultivation when treatments are applied to the roots because they provide precise control of the composition of the growth medium , ensuring the availability of different compounds. A problem arises when axenic conditions are needed but the treatment of choice ( exogenous organic acids or sugars) promote the growth of unwanted microorganisms. Moreover , axenic conditions are usually applied in liquid and semi-liquid growing systems , where oxygen availability can be compromised , if no aeration is provided. The driver for the development of this hydroponic system was the application of the organic acid pyruvate to the roots of plants grown under aerated axenic conditions. No contamination was detected in the nutrient solution , even after the addition of pyruvate. The system was validated in pea plants treated with either pyruvate or herbicides inhibiting amino acid biosynthesis. The effects on ethanol fermentation were compared by analysing the enzymatic activity , protein content and transcriptional levels in plants treated with either pyruvate or herbicides. The developed system enables the study of the exogenous application of organic acids in the nutrient solution under axenic conditions and without oxygen limitation. This system allows the study of the effect of any type of treatments applied to roots under aerated axenic hydroponic systems at physiological and molecular levels. The role of pyruvate in the induction of fermentation by herbicides can not be simply explained by an increase in substrate availability.
