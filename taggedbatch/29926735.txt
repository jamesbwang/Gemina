 A recent infection testing algorithm ( RITA) that includes a test for recent HIV<pathogen> infection and a viral load ( VL) test is the recommended strategy to estimate national HIV<pathogen> incidence , reducing false-recent misclassification to < 1 %. The inclusion of information on exposure to antiretroviral therapy ( ART) , as a supplement to VL testing , could improve RITA performance by further lowering false-recent misclassification of true long-term infection. In 2012 , Kenya and South Africa conducted national population-based surveys that collected information on HIV<pathogen> recency ( i.e. , HIV<pathogen> antibody seroconversion , on average , in the past 130 days) using the Limiting Antigen avidity ( LAg-Avidity) enzyme immunoassay , HIV<pathogen> RNA levels , and ART exposure among HIV-infected respondents aged 15-49 years. In Kenya , ART exposure was defined as testing positive for one or more antiretroviral ( ARV) drugs using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry , and , if not ARV-positive , self-reporting a history of ART exposure. In South Africa , ART exposure was defined as testing ARV-positive. Two RITA strategies were compared: RITA # 1 defined recent infection as testing LAg-Avidity-recent with unsuppressed VL ( HIV<pathogen> RNA â‰¥ 1,000 copies/ml) , and RITA # 2 defined recent infection as testing LAg-Avidity-recent with unsuppressed VL and , if unsuppressed , having no ART exposure. RITA-derived incidence among persons aged 15-49 years in Kenya was 0.9 % on RITA # 1 and 0.8 % on RITA # 2. In South Africa , RITA-derived incidence was 2.2 % on RITA # 1 and 1.7 % on RITA # 2. Among specimens testing recent with unsuppressed VL in Kenya and South Africa , 16.0 % and 19.7 % had evidence of ART exposure , respectively. Although the performance of a VL- and ART-based RITA was encouraging , additional research is needed across HIV-1 subtypes and subpopulations to calibrate and validate this algorithm.
