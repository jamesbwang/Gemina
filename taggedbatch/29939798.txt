 Investigation of bile acids ( BAs) as biomarkers for liver and kidney diseases has gained momentum recently to fulfill the needs in drug development and clinical practice , but a thorough and rapid profiling of BAs in human plasma has been hindered by the large interindividual variability and lack of selective methods. A selective and efficient UPLC-high resolution mass spectrometry method was developed and fully validated for the definitive profiling of 26 BAs in human plasma with a curve rage of 1-1000 ng/ml and a runtime of 7.2 min. Four BA combinations with good sensitivity and specificity show potential biomarker applications for liver injury and diseases.
