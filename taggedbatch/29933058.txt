 Group living reduces individual predation risk most effectively when group members are behaviorally and phenotypically similar. Group preferences are influenced by the individual , the members of the shoal , and the environmental conditions. While shoaling behavior has been studied extensively in the threespine stickleback ( Gasterosteus aculeatus<pathogen>) , it is unclear whether the sex of shoal mates influences the shoal preference of non-reproductive males and females and how this changes under increasing predation risk. Although non-reproductively active sticklebacks are sexually monochromatic in appearance , sex-related differences may result in sexual segregation when shoaling. Here we show that male and female sub-adult threespine sticklebacks had contrasting preferences for shoal mate sex , and that this preference was dependent on the level of predation risk during standardized experimental choice tests. In detail , test fish shoal with the opposite sex within low predation risk trials and with same-sex shoals within high predation risk trials. This difference might be linked to activity patterns; test males were more active than females. Our results demonstrate that differences between the sexes in a species with a sexually monochromatic non-reproductive stage can result in sex-related shoaling preferences. Most studies examining sexual segregation focus on sexually dimorphic species , but these results highlight the potentially widespread occurrence of sexual segregation beyond the sexually dimorphic reproductive stage.
