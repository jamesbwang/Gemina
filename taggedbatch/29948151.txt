 Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty ( DMEK) selectively removes diseased corneal endothelium and Descemet membrane and replaces them with healthy donor tissue. The DMEK technique represents the current gold standard for the treatment of corneal endothelial dysfunction. In this article the surgical technique for DMEK is presented by means of a video. The indications for surgery , patient education , anesthesia and patient positioning , postoperative treatment as well as possible complications and their management are described. The DMEK can be applied for the treatment of a wide range of corneal endothelial disorders. In addition to the operative implementation , the basis for the outstanding results of the surgical procedure are careful donor-patient allocation , thorough examination and follow-up of all patients and experience of the surgeon. The use of DMEK is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of corneal endothelial dysfunction. A standardized and individualized procedure provides the basis for optimal results compared to all previous transplantation procedures.
