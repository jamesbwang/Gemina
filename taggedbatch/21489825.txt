 Management of distal clavicle fractures remains controversial. Various treatment options have been described including open reduction and internal fixation with hook plate fixation , tension band wiring , screw fixation , and distal locking plates. Many of these techniques are associated with a high perioperative complication rate. We describe a surgical technique that allows indirect fixation of distal clavicle fractures and reconstruction of the CC ligaments without the use of prominent hardware.
