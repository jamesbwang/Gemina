 Allergic contact dermatitis<disease> ( ACD) is a common skin disease that results in significant cost and morbidity. Despite its high prevalence , therapeutic options are limited. Allergic contact dermatitis<disease> is regulated primarily by T cells within the adaptive immune system , but also by natural killer and innate lymphoid cells within the innate immune system. The chemokine receptor system , consisting of chemokine peptides and chemokine G protein-coupled receptors , is a critical regulator of inflammatory processes such as ACD. Specific chemokine signaling pathways are selectively up-regulated in ACD , most prominently CXCR3 and its endogenous chemokines CXCL9 , CXCL10 , and CXCL11. Recent research demonstrates that these 3 chemokines are not redundant and indeed activate distinct intracellular signaling profiles such as those activated by heterotrimeric G proteins and Î²-arrestin adapter proteins. Such differential signaling provides an attractive therapeutic target for novel therapies for ACD and other inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease>.
