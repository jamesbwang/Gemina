 Periodontal health is defined by absence of clinically detectable inflammation<symptom>. There is a biological level of immune surveillance that is consistent with clinical gingival health and homeostasis. Clinical gingival health may be found in a periodontium that is intact , i.e. without clinical attachment loss or bone loss , and on a reduced periodontium in either a non-periodontitis patient ( e.g. in patients with some form of gingival recession or following crown lengthening surgery) or in a patient with a history of periodontitis<disease> who is currently periodontally stable. Clinical gingival health can be restored following treatment of gingivitis<disease> and periodontitis<disease>. However , the treated and stable periodontitis<disease> patient with current gingival health remains at increased risk of recurrent periodontitis<disease> , and accordingly , must be closely monitored. Two broad categories of gingival diseases include non-dental plaque biofilm-induced gingival diseases and dental plaque-induced gingivitis<disease>. Non-dental plaque biofilm-induced gingival diseases include a variety of conditions that are not caused by plaque and usually do not resolve following plaque removal. Such lesions<symptom> may be manifestations of a systemic condition or may be localized to the oral cavity. Dental plaque-induced gingivitis<disease> has a variety of clinical signs and symptoms , and both local predisposing factors and systemic modifying factors can affect its extent , severity , and progression. Dental plaque-induced gingivitis<disease> may arise on an intact periodontium or on a reduced periodontium in either a non-periodontitis patient or in a currently stable `` periodontitis<disease> patient '' i.e. successfully treated , in whom clinical inflammation<symptom> has been eliminated ( or substantially reduced). A periodontitis<disease> patient with gingival inflammation<symptom> remains a periodontitis<disease> patient ( Figure 1) , and comprehensive risk assessment and management are imperative to ensure early prevention and/or treatment of recurrent/progressive periodontitis<disease>. Precision dental medicine defines a patient-centered approach to care , and therefore , creates differences in the way in which a `` case '' of gingival health or gingivitis<disease> is defined for clinical practice as opposed to epidemiologically in population prevalence surveys. Thus , case definitions of gingival health and gingivitis<disease> are presented for both purposes. While gingival health and gingivitis<disease> have many clinical features , case definitions are primarily predicated on presence or absence of bleeding on probing. Here we classify gingival health and gingival diseases/conditions , along with a summary table of diagnostic features for defining health and gingivitis<disease> in various clinical situations.
