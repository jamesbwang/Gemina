 We compared epinephrine and dopamine as a first-line vasoactive drug in 40 neonates ( enrolled in two gestational age strata ≤ 30 Epinephrine ( 0.2-0.4 μg/kg/min) and dopamine ( 10-20 μg/kg/min) had comparable efficacy and safety in neonatal septic shock.Clinical Trial registry name and registration number: The study was registered with Clinical Trial Registry of India CTRI/2015/10/ 006285. What is Known: • The choice of vasoactive drugs in neonatal septic shock<symptom> is empirical and dopamine is the conventional first-line vasoactive drug. • There are no randomized controlled trials comparing dopamine and epinephrine in neonatal septic shock<symptom>. What is New: • In this study , epinephrine and dopamine had comparable efficacy and safety as a first-line vasoactive drug in management of neonatal septic shock<symptom>. • On stratified analysis in a limited sample , epinephrine was associated with better outcomes in neonates ≤ 30
