 Heightened response to drug-related cues is a hallmark of addiction. Extended-release naltrexone ( XR-NTX) is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacotherapy for relapse prevention in patients with opioid use disorder ( OUD). In these patients , XR-NTX has been shown to reduce brain responses to opioid-related visual stimuli. To assess the biomarker potential of this phenomenon , it is necessary to determine whether this effect is limited to opioid-related stimuli and whether it is associated with key OUD symptoms. Using functional MRI ( fMRI) , we measured the brain responses to opioid-related and control ( i.e. , sexual and aversive) images in detoxified patients with OUD before , during and after XR-NTX treatment. Craving and withdrawal severity were evaluated using clinician- and self-administered instruments during each session. We included 24 patients with OUD in our analysis. During XR-NTX treatment , we found reduced responses to opioid-related stimuli in the nucleus accumbens ( NAcc) and medial orbitofrontal cortex ( mOFC). The reduction in mOFC response was specific to the opioid-related stimuli. The reduced NAcc and mOFC opioid cue reactivity was correlated with reduction in clinician-assessed and self-reported withdrawal symptoms , respectively. The study was not placebo-controlled owing to ethical , safety and feasibility concerns. Extended-release naltrexone reduces the NAcc and mOFC cue reactivity in patients with OUD. This effect is specific to opioid-related stimuli in the mOFC only. The reduction in neural response to opioid-related stimuli is more robust in patients with greater decline in withdrawal severity. Our results support the clinical utility of mesocorticolimbic cue reactivity in monitoring the XR-NTX treatment outcomes and highlight the link between opioid withdrawal symptomatology and neural opioid cue reactivity.
