 A novel pipeline for neoantigen-specific T cell receptor ( TCR) identification has been validated in ovarian cancer , making use of HLA-matched allogeneic healthy donor T cells. This workflow allows for the identification of tumor-specific TCRs two weeks after antigen-specific stimulation and eliminates problematic patient-to-patient variation in the selection of neoantigen-specific TCRs.
