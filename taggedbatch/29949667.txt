 The aim of this study was to identify if prolonged length of hospital stay was protective for certain post-discharge complications requiring readmission after pancreatectomy. Patients undergoing elective pancreatectomy from 2012 to 2013 were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program ( ACS-NSQIP). Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to elucidate the association of length of hospital stay ( LOS) , in-hospital complications , and post-discharge complications with 30-day hospital readmission. Mean LOS for the readmitted versus not readmitted cohort was 9.01 and 10.36 , respectively ( P < 0.001). Approximately half of hospital readmissions occur within 7 days of discharge from the hospital. The readmission rate ( after hospital discharge) for patients with any in-hospital complication was 13.2 %. On the other hand , the readmission rate for patients with any post-discharge complication was 70.8 %. Readmission rates were above 85 % for patients with the following post-discharge complications: organ/space surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> ( SSI) , pneumonia<disease> , ventilator dependence greater than 48 h , progressive renal insufficiency , sepsis<disease> , and septic shock<symptom>. In a multivariate logistic regression model , prolonged LOS reduced the odds of any post-discharge complication requiring readmission ( OR = 0.68 , P = 0.01). Specifically , prolonged LOS reduced the odds of a post-discharge organ/space SSI requiring readmission ( OR = 0.72 , P = 0.02). Readmission after pancreatectomy primarily occurs due to a new post-discharge event. Furthermore , increased LOS is protective for readmission for post-pancreatectomy complications , particularly those due to post-discharge organ space SSIs. Our findings suggest that solely focusing on reducing LOS in pancreatectomy may lead to the unintended consequence of increasing readmission rates.
