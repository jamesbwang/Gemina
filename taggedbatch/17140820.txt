 Endovascular treatment ( ET) of iliac occlusive disease ( IOD) is well established in literature. Use of stents in IOD has achieved long-term limb salvage and patency rates similar to those of open surgery , with lower morbidity and mortality rates. To report the long-term outcomes , particularly limb salvage and patency rates , of ET for IOD and the factors associated with these outcomes. This retrospective cohort study included patients with IOD who underwent iliac angioplasty ( IA) , between January 2009 and January 2015. Patients with critical limb ischemia or incapacitating claudication were included. In total , 48 IA procedures were performed in 46 patients , with an initial technical success rate of 95.83 %. Failure occurred in two patients , who were excluded , leaving 44 patients and 46 IA. The primary patency , secondary patency , limb salvage , and survival rates at 1200 days were 88 % , 95.3 % , 86.3 % , and 69.9 % , respectively. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression revealed that the primary patency rate was significantly worse in patients with TASC type C/D than in patients with TASC type A/B ( p = 0.044). Analysis of factors associated with major amputation using Cox regression showed that the rate of limb<symptom> loss<symptom> was greater in patients with TASC type C/D ( p = 0.043). Male gender was associated with reduced survival ( p = 0.011). TASC type C/D was associated with a higher number of reinterventions and with worse limb<symptom> loss<symptom> and primary patency rates. Male gender was associated with a worse survival rate after ET of IOD.
