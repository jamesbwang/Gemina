 Cardiac biomarkers are an integral part of the diagnostic work-up and risk stratification of patients with chest<symptom> pain<symptom>. Cardiac troponins are highly sensitive diagnostic biomarkers in patients with acute coronary syndrome<disease><symptom> and have prognostic value in a multitude of acute and chronic<disease> diseases<disease>. In patients with suspected pulmonary embolism ( PE) D‑dimer can be used together with the Wells score for exclusion of PE. In patients with confirmed PE , B‑type natriuretic peptide ( BNP) , N‑terminal pro-BNP ( NT-proBNP) and heart-type fatty acid binding protein ( h-FABP) can be used for risk stratification. Although normal D‑dimer levels largely decrease the possibility of acute aortic dissection , clinicians should not rely on D‑dimer alone to exclude the diagnosis of acute aortic syndrome<disease><symptom>. This continuing medical education article provides an overview of the most important biomarkers recommended in current guidelines for differential diagnoses of patients with chest<symptom> pain<symptom> with a focus on cardiac troponins in acute coronary syndrome<disease><symptom>.
