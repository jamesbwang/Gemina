 To investigate the excretion and conjugation profile of testosterone ( T) , Epitestosterone ( EpiT) , and other androgen metabolites in different phases of pregnancy and postpregnancy as a reflection of the `` androgenic exposure. '' Consecutive recruitment of pregnant women. Maternity outpatient low-risk pregnancy clinic. Seventy-seven pregnant women. Collection of urine for analyses of sulfate ( S) and glucuronide ( G) conjugates and metabolic ratios of androgens and androgen metabolites using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Excretion profiles and metabolic ratios of G and S conjugates of T , EpiT , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA) , androsterone ( A) , etiocholanolone ( Etio) , and dihydrotestosterone in relation to trimester and postpartum , body mass index , fetal sex , and ethnicity. T-S excretion increased significantly between the second and third trimester , whereas excretion of T-G did not change. In contrast , both conjugates of EpiT increased markedly , more so for the Pregnancy influences the androgen excretion profile , with the most profound change being an increase in EpiT excretion throughout the trimesters. EpiT may modulate the effect of T , but its exact role during pregnancy is not known. There were marked differences in the S/G conjugate ratios between androgens upstream and downstream from T in the metabolic network. These results are interesting to compare with the androgen disposition in women with endocrine disorders or abuse of steroids.
