 A fiber optic surface plasmon resonance ( FOSPR) sensor was developed for detection of Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 ( E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7) in water and juice , based on antimicrobial peptides ( AMP) , Magainin I , as recognition elements and silver nanoparticles-reduced graphene oxide ( AgNPs-rGO) nanocomposites assisted signal amplification. The uniform AgNPs-rGO was fixed on the surface of optical fiber and covered with gold film. Not only was the SPR response greatly enhanced , but also the AgNPs was prevented from being oxidized. The FOSPR showed a sensitivity of about 1.5 times higher than that fabricated only with gold film. In the assay , Magainin I , immobilized on the surface of gold film , could specifically capture E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 , resulting in the wavelength shift of the SPR absorption peak. Under the optimized conditions , the SPR resonance wavelength exhibited a good linear relationship with natural logarithm of the target bacteria concentration in the range of 1.0 Ã— 10
