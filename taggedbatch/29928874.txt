 Serum deprivation is a likely contributor to intervertebral disc ( IVD) degeneration ( IVDD) .17 Î²-estradiol ( E2) have been noted to protect nucleus pulposus cells ( NPCs) against apoptosis. Autophagy and apoptosis play a paramount role in maintaining the homeostasis of IVD. So far , little research has been published on whether autophagy plays a role for the E2 mediated protection of NPCs. The aim of this study is to understand whether autophagy is involved in the protective effect of E2 against serum deprivation-induced cell apoptosis and expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP) -3 and MMP-13. mCherry-GFP-LC3-adenovirus transfection is used to monitor autophagy detection. The expression levels of autophagy-related proteins were measured by Western blotting , Apoptosis and MMPs were detected by flow cytometry and Western blotting. Accordingly , Autophagy and apoptosis was detected in NP cells under serum deprivation conditions , the autophagy incidence began to reached a peak value at 48 h , the apoptosis and MMPs incidence began reached a minimum value treat with E2 ( 10
