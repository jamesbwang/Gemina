 Purpose of present study is to evaluate whether the Pre-Macular Bursa ( PMB) modifies Wall Shear Stress ( WSS) at the retinal surface during saccadic movements. We created a mathematical model consisting of 25,000 grid cells and simulated a horizontal saccade spanning 50 ° in 0.17 s , both in absence and in presence of the PMB. Wall Shear Stress SS was computed throughout the retinal surface and the posterior pole was divided into 3 Zones comprising 400 nodes each: Zone 1 ( radius 3.5 mm; 0 ° -17 °) corresponding to the PMB area; Zone 2 ( concentric annular area 5 mm in radius; 22 °) and Zone 3 ( concentric annular area 5.5 mm; 28 °). The PMB reduced WSS significantly at the macula and increased it in the immediate surroundings. Average WSS in Zone 1 was 1.53 ± 1.01 ( max 4.23 Pa) with PMB Vs 6.94 ± 9.23 ( max 35.83 Pa) without. Zone 2 WSS was 9.39 ± 10.33 ( max 48.36 Pa) with PMB Vs 6.95 ± 9.40 ( max 38.60 Pa) without Zone 3 WSS was 8.41 ± 10.03 ( max 43.16 Pa) with PMB Vs 6.88 ± 9.42 ( max 39.43 Pa) without ( p < 0.001 in all cases). The PMB significantly reduces WSS over the retinal surface underlying the bursa region; conversely , WSS slightly increases it in the immediate neighboring areas.
