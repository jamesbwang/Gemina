 To explore the morphological characteristics of bone<disease> marrow cells of multiple myeloma with non-bone-related extramedullary disease and thier clinical significance. Bone<disease> marrow smears , peripheral blood smears and bone<disease> marrow biopsy sections as well as thier examination results of 20 cases of multiple myloma with non-bone-related extramedullary disease were collected at initial diagnosis in First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from March 2013 to March 2016 , and morphological characterisistes of bone<disease> marrow cells were analysed in combination with clinical data. The morphology of plasma cells in 20 patients showed 2 cytologic subtypes: primitive cell type ( 16 cases) and pleomorphic type ( 4 cases). Immature plasma cells were found in the 5 patients ' peripheral blood smear , accounting for about 1 % -4 % of the number of peripheral blood cells. In bone<disease> marrow tissue , plasma cells hyperproliferated with nodular and packed type , and secondary myelofibrosis counted for 12 cases ( 60 %). 13 MM patients whose non-bone-related extramedullary disease occurred during therapy were divided into 2 groups according to the marrow fibrosis<disease> density. The median time from diagnosis of MM to extramedullary lesions<symptom> resulting from fibrosis<disease> 0-1 grade and 2-3 grade was 23.7 ± 3.7 months and 10.5 ± 3.2 months ahead of the former ( P = 0.025). Bone<disease> marrow plasma cell morphology of multiple myeloma with non-bone-related extramedullary disease at the initial diagnosis is mostly immature type , and plasma cells proliferate with nodular and packed type and accompanied by different degree of fibrosis<disease>. The degree of myelofibrosis indirectly reflects the degree of proliferation and malignancy of the bone<disease> marrow plasma cells , which maybe possess some value in predicting extramedullary disease in the early stages of the MM.
