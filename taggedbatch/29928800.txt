 The ability of RNA to sense , regulate , and store information is an attractive attribute for a variety of functional applications including the development of regulatory control devices for synthetic biology. RNA folding and function is known to be highly context sensitive , which limits the modularity and reuse of RNA regulatory devices to control different heterologous sequences and genes. We explored the cause and effect of sequence context sensitivity for translational ON riboswitches located in the 5 ' UTR , by constructing and screening a library of N-terminal synonymous codon variants. By altering the N-terminal codon usage we were able to obtain RNA devices with a broad range of functional performance properties ( ON , OFF , fold-change). Linear regression and calculated metrics were used to rationalize the major determining features leading to optimal riboswitch performance , and to identify multiple interactions between the explanatory metrics. Finally , partial least squared ( PLS) analysis was employed in order to understand the metrics and their respective effect on performance. This PLS model was shown to provide good explanation of our library. This study provides a novel multivariant analysis framework to rationalize the codon context performance of allosteric RNA-devices. The framework will also serve as a platform for future riboswitch context engineering endeavors.
