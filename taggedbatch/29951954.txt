 Autophagy is a catabolic process which is involved in the development of many diseases including diabetes mellitus and its complications. Hyposalivation is a common complication of diabetes mellitus , whereas its mechanism remains unclear. Here , we observed that the stimulated salivary flow rate of SMG was significantly decreased in db/db mice , a diabetic mice model. The expressions of aquaporin 5 ( AQP5) , a water channel protein , were decreased , whereas the mRNA level of AQP5 was increased in SMGs of both diabetic patients and mice. Under transmission electron microcope , more autophagosomes were detected in diabetic SMGs. Expressions of autophagy related proteins LC3II , Beclin-1 and ATG5 were increased , meanwhile autophagy substrate p62 was decreased in SMGs of diabetic patients and mice , indicating that autophagy was activated in diabetic SMG. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that the colocalization of AQP5 and LC3 was increased in SMGs of diabetic mice. In cultured SMG-C6 cells , high glucose ( HG) , but not high osmotic pressure , reduced AQP5 protein expression and induced autophagy. Moreover , inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenin , an autophagy inhibitor , or by autophagy-related gene 5 siRNA , decreased HG-induced AQP5 reduction in SMG-C6 cells. Additionally , the expression of p-p85 , p-Akt and p-mTOR were decreased in HG-treated SMG-C6 cells. Pretreatment with 740Y-P , a PI3K agonist , significantly suppressed HG-induced autophagy and AQP5 degradation. Taken together , these results indicate that autophagy plays a crucial role in AQP5 degradation in diabetic SMG via PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway , which contributes to the dysfunction of diabetic SMG. Our study provides a novel mechanism of diabetic hyposalivation.
