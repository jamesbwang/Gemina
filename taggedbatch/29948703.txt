 Spatial variations of Cr , Cu , Hg , Ni , Pb , and Zn in the surface sediments from 34 stations of the Kaohsiung coastal zone southwestern Taiwan were studied to address the current pollution status , sediment quality , and potential ecological risk. The study revealed that the concentrations of sediment metals in Kaohsiung Harbor were alarmingly high compared to the other region of Kaohsiung coast. The concentrations of Cr , Cu , Hg , Ni , Pb , and Zn in the harbor sediments were as high as 351 , 247 , 1.93 , 61.8 , 60.9 , and 940 mg kg
