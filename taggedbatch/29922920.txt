 We show that an inhomogeneous Bernoulli site percolation process running upon a fullerene 's dual ( Formula: see text) can be used for representing bivalents attached to the nuclear envelope in mouse Mus<pathogen> M. Domesticus 2n = 40 meiotic spermatocytes during pachytene. It is shown that the induced clustering generated by overlapping percolation domains correctly reproduces the probability distribution observed in the experiments ( data) after fine tuning the parameters.
