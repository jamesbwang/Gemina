 Alveolar bone cyst<symptom> enucleation can give rise to critical-size defects whose healing may be incomplete due to the loss of periosteum or bone walls and there is a paucity of studies investigating the use of immediate bone grafts. The aim of this study was to compare spontaneous healing versus a deproteinized bovine bone graft. In this prospective randomized clinical pilot study , twenty patients requiring the removal of a cyst<symptom> â‰¥ 20 mm in maximum diameter were randomly assigned to one of two groups: deproteinized bovine bone grafting ( test) or spontaneous healing ( control). Computed tomographies were obtained preoperatively and 12 months after surgery and the radiolucent volumes were compared. Residual radiological morphology and clinical outcomes at 7 days and 1 , 6 and 12 months after surgery were also assessed. The median percentage reduction in the volume of the defect was 98 % in the test group and 73 % in the control group ( P = 0.001) with an evidence of soft<disease> tissue invagination in the latter. There were no differences in the clinical parameters between the two groups. Within the limitations of this pilot study , the healing of critical-size alveolar bone defects is incomplete at 1 year observation and the use of deproteinized bovine bone graft did not influence the clinical outcomes.
