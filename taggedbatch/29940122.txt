 Subwavelength imaging requires the use of high numerical aperture ( NA) lenses together with immersion liquids in order to achieve the highest possible resolution. Following exciting recent developments in metasurfaces that have achieved efficient focusing and novel beam-shaping , the race is on to demonstrate ultrahigh-NA metalenses. The highest NA that has been demonstrated so far is NA = 1.1 , achieved with a TiO
