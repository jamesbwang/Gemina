 The analysis of the mental health in children under 14 years has become a research topic of global interest where the family can be a key factor for protection or risk against mental health problems. With this work , we intend to determine , employing binary logistic regression analysis , whether parental acceptance-rejection perceived by boys and girls can predict their mental health. Seven hundred sixty-two students participated , the average age was 12.23 years; 53.8 % ( n = 410) girls and 46.2 % ( n = 352) boys. We have used the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire ( SDQ) , self-reported version and the Affection Scale children version ( EA-H) for parental acceptance-rejection to assess mental health. The odds ratio ( OR) of the logistic models reports that there is a greater probability of having mental health problems in boys and girls when they perceive that they are highly criticized and rejected by their parents. With our work , we highlight the importance of the environment and family affection on mental health. The perception of the children about the rejection , aversion , and criticism of their parents constitutes a risk factor in the manifestation of mental health problems.
