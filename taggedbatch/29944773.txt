 Here we report a broadly applicable one-pot methodology for the facile transformation of linear peptides into tetracyclic peptides via a CEPS/CLIPS/CuAAC ( `` triple-C '') locking methodology. Linear peptides with varying lengths ( â‰¥ 14 amino acids) , comprising two cysteines and two azidohomoalanines ( Aha) , were efficiently cyclized head-to-tail using the peptiligase variant omniligase-1 ( CEPS). Subsequent ligation-cyclization using tetravalent ( T41/2) scaffolds containing two bromomethyl groups and two alkyne functionalities yielded isomerically pure tetracyclic peptides. Sixteen different functional tetracycles , derived from bicyclic inhibitors against urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA) and coagulation factor XIIa ( FXIIa) , were successfully synthesized and their bioactivities evaluated. Two of these ( FF-T41/ 2) exhibited increased inhibitory activity against FXIIa as compared to a bicyclic control peptide. The corresponding hetero-bifunctional variants ( UF/FU-T 41/2) , bearing a single copy of each inhibitory sequence , exhibited micromolar activities against both uPA and FXIIa , thus illustrating the potential of the `` bifunctional tetracycle peptide '' inhibitor concept.
