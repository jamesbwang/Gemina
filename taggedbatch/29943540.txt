 In order to improve the nutritional value and bio-availability of sheep bone enzymatic hydrolysates , we tried to ferment the hydrolysates with lactic acid bacteria ( LAB) to enhance free Ca ² ⁺ , to generate oligopeptide and antioxidative activity. First , we isolated 7 LAB strains from commercial starters and selected Lactobacillus<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> as the starter for its highest protease-producing ability. The content of released Ca ² ⁺ was evaluated when the fermenting conditions were optimized by the method of responsive surface design. When supplemented with 1 % maltose and inoculated 4 % L.<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> , at initial pH 5.5 and 37 ℃ for 14 h , Ca ² ⁺ content in the hydrolysates increased significantly ( P < 0.05) , as well as the generation oligopeptide ( P < 0.01) , and the content of hydroxyproline ( P < 0.01). The count of L.<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> in the fermented hydrolysates reached to 94.6 × 10 ⁸ CFU/mL. L.<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> fermentation significantly enhanced the ability to scavenge free radicals DPPH , · OH and O ₂ ⁻ · ( P < 0.01 , P < 0.05). Therefore , fermenting sheep bone hydrolysates by L.<pathogen> plantarum<pathogen> can increase free Ca ² ⁺ , oligopeptide and antioxidative ability.
