 Oral delivery is the most common method of drug administration with high safety and good compliance for patients. However , delivering therapeutic proteins to the target site via oral route involves tremendous challenge due to unfavourable conditions like biochemical barrier , mucus barrier and epithelial barriers. According to the functional differences of various protein drug delivery systems , the recent advances in pH responsive polymer-based drug delivery system , mucoadhesive polymer-based drug delivery system , absorption enhancers-based drug delivery system and composite polymer-based delivery system all were briefly summarised in this review , which not only clarified the clinic potential of these novel drug delivery systems , but also described the way for increasing oral bioavailability of therapeutic protein.
