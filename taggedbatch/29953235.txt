 To break free of the limitations imposed by three-dimensional ( 3D) perovskites , such as their lackluster stability , researchers have opened new frontiers into lower-dimensional perovskite derivatives. Thanks to advances in solvent-based synthesis methods , zero-dimensional ( 0D) inorganic perovskites , mainly Cs
