 Covering: 2000-2018In this review , we highlight recent examples of natural product total syntheses employing transition metal-mediated/catalyzed carbonylative cyclization strategies to build key ring systems. It mainly covers carbonylative cyclizations for the construction of O-heterocycles , N-heterocycles and carbocycles including cyclic ketones and phenols. The reaction types include carbonylation of epoxide to β-lactones , carbonylative ( macro) lactonization/lactamization , the Semmelhack reaction , tandem hydroformylation-cyclization , the Pauson-Khand reaction , carbonylative C-H activation cyclization , the Stille/Suzuki carbonylation , ( n + m + 1) carbonylative cycloaddition , the Dötz annulation , and others.
