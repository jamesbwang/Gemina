 To determine whether tetrabenazine ( TBZ) use is associated with an increased incidence of depression<symptom> and/or suicidal ideation. In this retrospective cross-sectional study of the Enroll-HD database , we used multiple logistic regression analyses to determine whether TBZ use is associated with an increased incidence of depression<symptom> and/or suicidal ideation. For both dependent variables ( depression<symptom> and suicidality) , separate analyses were conducted on ( 1) all participants , ( 2) only participants with a history of depression<symptom> , and ( 3) only participants with no history of depression<symptom>. Adjustments were made for CAG repeat length , total motor score , total functional capacity , Symbol Digit Modalities Test score , sex , disease duration , history of depression<symptom> ( when applicable) , antipsychotic use , and antidepressant use. Compared to participants who were not using TBZ ( n = 3,548) , TBZ users ( n = 543) did not have an increased risk of depression<symptom> ( odds ratio ( OR) = 0.78 , TBZ use was not associated with an increased incidence of depression<symptom> or suicidality. These findings suggest that TBZ may be safe to use in patients with Huntington disease who have a history of depression<symptom>.
