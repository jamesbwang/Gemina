 Ductility , i.e. , uniform strain achievable in uniaxial tension , diminishes for materials with very high yield strength. Even for the CrCoNi medium-entropy alloy ( MEA) , which has a simple face-centered cubic ( FCC) structure that would bode well for high ductility , the fine grains processed to achieve gigapascal strength exhaust the strain hardening ability such that , after yielding , the uniform tensile strain is as low as âˆ¼ 2 %. Here we purposely deploy , in this MEA , a three-level heterogeneous grain structure ( HGS) with grain sizes spanning the nanometer to micrometer range , imparting a high yield strength well in excess of 1 GPa. This heterogeneity results from this alloy 's low stacking fault energy , which facilitates corner twins in recrystallization and stores deformation twins and stacking faults during tensile straining. After yielding , the elastoplastic transition through load transfer and strain partitioning among grains of different sizes leads to an upturn of the strain hardening rate , and , upon further tensile straining at room temperature , corner twins evolve into nanograins. This dynamically reinforced HGS leads to a sustainable strain hardening rate , a record-wide hysteresis loop in load-unload-reload stress-strain curve and hence high back stresses , and , consequently , a uniform tensile strain of 22 %. As such , this HGS achieves , in a single-phase FCC alloy , a strength-ductility combination that would normally require heterogeneous microstructures such as in dual-phase steels.
