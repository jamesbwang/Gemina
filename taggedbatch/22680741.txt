 Thermoelectric materials are capable of converting waste heat into electricity. The dimensionless figure-of-merit ( ZT) , as the critical measure for the material 's thermoelectric performance , plays a decisive role in the energy conversion efficiency. Half-Heusler materials , as one of the most promising candidates for thermoelectric power generation , have relatively low ZTs compared to other material systems. Here we report the discovery of p-type ZrCoBi-based half-Heuslers with a record-high ZT of ∼ 1.42 at 973 K and a high thermoelectric conversion efficiency of ∼ 9 % at the temperature difference of ∼ 500 K. Such an outstanding thermoelectric performance originates from its unique band structure offering a high band degeneracy ( N
