 Endocan , a component of the endothelial glycocalyx ( EG) , has been linked with respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> in sepsis<disease>. This study explored the temporal patterns of three EG biomarkers , including endocan , and their relationships with inflammation<symptom> and respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom>. Plasma endocan , syndecan-1 , and hyaluronan concentrations were measured in Emergency Department ( ED) patients with sepsis<disease> due to pneumonia<disease> ( n = 44) on ED arrival ( T0) , 1 h ( T1) , 3 h ( T3) and 12-24 h ( T24) later , with change over time tested using mixed regression models. Biomarker associations with inflammatory cytokine concentrations and with respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> on days 1 , 2 or 3 , need for mechanical ventilation and 30-day mortality were also tested. Endocan concentration significantly decreased over time ( T0-T24 , P = 0.003) whereas both syndecan-1 ( T0-T3 , P = 0.010; T0-T24 , P < 0.001) and hyaluronan ( T0-T1 , P = 0.010; T0-T3 , P < 0.001; T0-T24 , P = 0.003) significantly increased over time. Increased syndecan-1 was significantly correlated with neutrophil activation biomarkers and significantly increased the odds of respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> ( OR 1.18 , 95 % CI 1.05-1.33 , P = 0.004) , need for mechanical ventilation ( OR 1.24 , 95 % CI 1.04-1.48 , P = 0.014) and 30-day mortality ( OR 1.29 , 95 % CI 1.07-1.55 , P = 0.008). Syndecan-1 , but not endocan , was associated with neutrophil activation and was the best EG biomarker predictor of adverse clinical outcomes.
