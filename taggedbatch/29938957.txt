 Trabecular microstructure is an important factor in determining bone strength and physiological function. Normal X-ray and computed tomography ( CT) can not accurately reflect the microstructure of trabecular bone. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography ( HR-pQCT) is a new imaging technique in recent years. It can qualitatively and quantitatively measure the three-dimensional microstructure and volume bone mineral density of trabecular bone
