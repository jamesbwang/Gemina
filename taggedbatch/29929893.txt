 There is increasing burnout incidence among medical disciplines , and physicians working in emergency settings seem at higher risk. Cardiac anesthesiology is a stressful anesthesiology subspecialty dealing with high-risk patients. The authors hypothesized a high risk of burnout in cardiac anesthesiologists. National survey conducted on burnout SETTING: Italian cardiac centers. Cardiac anesthesiologists. The authors administered via email an anonymous questionnaire divided into 3 parts. The first 2 parts evaluated workload and private life. The third part consisted of the Maslach Burnout Inventory test with its 3 constituents: high emotional exhaustion<symptom> , high depersonalization , and low personal accomplishment. The authors measured the prevalence and risk of burnout through the Maslach Burnout Inventory questionnaire and analyzed factors influencing burnout. Among 670 contacts from 71 centers , 382 cardiac anesthesiologists completed the survey ( 57 %). The authors found the following mean Maslach Burnout Inventory values: 14.5 ± 9.7 ( emotional exhaustion<symptom>) , 9.1 ± 7.1 ( depersonalization) , and 33.7 ± 8.9 ( personal accomplishment). A rate of 34 % , 54 % , and 66 % of respondents scored in `` high '' or `` moderate-high '' risk of burnout ( emotional exhaustion<symptom> , depersonalization , and personal accomplishment , respectively). The authors found that , if offered to change subspecialty , 76 % of respondents would prefer to remain in cardiac anesthesiology. This preference and parenthood were the only 2 investigated factors with a protective effect against all components of burnout. Significantly lower burnout scores were found in more experienced anesthesiologists. A relatively high incidence of burnout was found in cardiac anesthesiologists , especially regarding high depersonalization and low personal accomplishment. Nonetheless , most of the respondents would choose to remain in cardiac anesthesiology.
