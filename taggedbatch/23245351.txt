 The cancer-associated protein Anterior Gradient 2 ( AGR2) has been described , predominantly in adenocarcinomas. Increased levels of extracellular AGR2 ( eAGR2) have been correlated with poor prognosis in cancer patients , making it a potential biomarker. Additionally , neutralizing AGR2 antibodies showed preclinical effectiveness in murine cancer models suggesting eAGR2 may be a therapeutic target. We set out to identify a peptide by mRNA display that would serve as a theranostic tool targeting AGR2. This method enables the selection of peptides from a complex ( > 10
