 Controlled macrophage differentiation and activation in the initiation and resolution of inflammation<symptom> is crucial for averting progression to chronic<disease> inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Here we show a negative feedback mechanism for proinflammatory IFN-γ activation of macrophages driven by macrophage-associated matrix metalloproteinase 12 ( MMP12). Through C-terminal truncation of IFN-γ at 135Glu ↓ Leu136 the IFN-γ receptor-binding site was efficiently removed thereby reducing JAK-STAT1 signaling and IFN-γ activation of proinflammatory macrophages. In acute peritonitis<disease> this signature was absent in Mmp12
