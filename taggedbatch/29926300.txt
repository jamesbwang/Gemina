 South African guidelines for prevention-of-mother-to-child-transmission ( PMTCT) of HIV<pathogen> emphasize exclusive breastfeeding ( EBF). This study examined the impact of a PMTCT intervention and male involvement on EBF. In a two-phase cluster-randomized trial , rural South African community health centers were randomized to offer HIV-infected pregnant women PMTCT standard of care plus either: a behavioral PMTCT intervention , or a time-equivalent attention-control condition. Phase 1 women had non-participating male partners; Phase 2 women had participating partners. Pregnant women ( n = 1398) were assessed on HIV<pathogen> stigma , disclosure of HIV<pathogen> status to partner , male involvement , and family planning knowledge. Feeding practices were assessed 6 weeks postpartum ( 56 % retained). Reduced depressive symptomatology predicted EBF 6 weeks postpartum , adjusting for attrition ( AOR = 0.954 , p = 0.001). Neither male involvement in antenatal care , phase , HIV<pathogen> stigma , disclosure , nor family planning knowledge predicted EBF. Future studies and perinatal care should address depression<symptom> , which has important implications for infant health.
