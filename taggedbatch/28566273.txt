 Glycated hemoglobin ( A1c) is used to diagnose type 2 diabetes and monitor glycemic control. Specific genetic variants interfere with A1c and effects/frequencies of some variants vary by ancestry. In this review , we summarize findings from large trans-ethnic meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies ( GWAS) of A1c and describe some variants influencing erythrocyte biology and interfering with A1c. Recent GWAS meta-analyses have revealed 60 loci associated with A1c in multi-ethnic populations. The main A1c genetic driver in African Americans is rs1050828 ( G6PD). Some identified loci are located in/near genes known as monogenic causes of erythrocytic disorders ( ANK1 , SPTA1) or iron disorders ( TMPRSS6 , HFE). Uncommon genetic variants ( not revealed by GWAS) that are known to cause hemoglobinopathies may also influence A1C levels , partly by interfering with laboratory assays. Specific genetic variants that have a large impact on A1c levels may influence clinical practice , especially in individuals of African descent. Efforts to reveal novel A1c loci should focus on increasing representation of GWAS in non-European ancestries , and on using better genome-wide coverage of uncommon variants that are specific to each population.
