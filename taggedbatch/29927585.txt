 Dissociative bioorthogonal reactions allow for chemically controlling the release of bioactive agents and reporter probes. Here we describe 3-isocyanopropyl substituents as masking groups that can be effectively removed in biological systems. 3-Isocyanopropyl derivatives react with tetrazines to afford 3-oxopropyl groups that eliminate diverse functionalities. The study shows that the reaction is rapid and can liberate phenols and amines near-quantitatively under physiological conditions. The reaction is compatible with living organisms as demonstrated by the release of a resorufin fluorophore and a mexiletine drug in zebrafish embryos implanted with tetrazine-modified beads. The combined benefits of synthetic ease , rapid kinetics , diversity of leaving groups , high release yields , and structural compactness , make 3-isocyanopropyl derivatives attractive chemical caging moieties for uses in chemical biology and drug delivery.
