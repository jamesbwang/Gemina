 Osteosarcoma is a rare neoplasm in the lumbar spine. Although osteosarcoma can arise in any portion of the skeleton , it very rarely arises in the spinal canal , which accounts for < 0.1 % of all cases of adult sarcomas<disease>. Here , we describe a case of osteosarcoma arising in the L4-5 spinal canal. The present report describes the case of a 55-year-old female patient with osteosarcoma of the L4-5 spinal canal. The patient was initially diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis and underwent lumbar fusion at a local hospital. At the 4-month follow-up , the patient reported a marked increase in numbness and pain in the lumbar region and lower limbs. Based on magnetic resonance imaging , we diagnosed a postoperative infectious lesion<symptom> of the lumbar spine. The patient underwent surgery for complete removal of the mass lesion<symptom>. The mass measured 3 × 2.5 × 0.7 cm in size and was located in the L4-5 spinal canal. Based on histological and immunohistochemical findings , the diagnosis of osteosarcoma was confirmed by an expert pathology consultant. The patient then received chemotherapy. Postoperative follow-up at 6 months revealed no evidence of recurrent disease or residual side effects from therapy. Osteosarcoma in the L4-5 spinal canal is extremely rare and very difficult to distinguish histologically from benign nervous and fibrous tissue. This is a very valuable case , which highlights the need for orthopedic surgeons to consider this when diagnosing patients with spinal tumors.
