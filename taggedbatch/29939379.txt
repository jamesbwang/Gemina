 Nurses are the main providers of patient education in inpatient and outpatient settings. Unfortunately , nurses may lack knowledge of chronic medical conditions , such as heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. The purpose of this one-group pretest-posttest intervention was to determine the effectiveness of teaching intervention on nurses ' knowledge of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> self-care principles in an ambulatory care setting. The sample consisted of 40 staff nurses in ambulatory care. Nurse participants received a focused education intervention based on knowledge deficits revealed in the pretest and were then resurveyed within 30 days. Nurses were evaluated using the valid and reliable 20-item Nurses Knowledge of Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom> Education Principles Survey tool. The results of this project demonstrated that an education intervention on heart<symptom> failure<symptom> self-care principles improved nurses ' knowledge of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> in an ambulatory care setting , which was statistically significant ( p < .05). Results suggest that a teaching intervention could improve knowledge of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , which could lead to better patient education and could reduce patient readmission for heart<symptom> failure<symptom>.
