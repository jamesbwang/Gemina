 Health-related quality of life ( HRQL) preference-based scores are used to assess the health of populations and patients and for cost-effectiveness analyses. The National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS To produce societal preference-based scores for 7 PROMIS domains: Cognitive Function-Abilities , Depression<symptom> , Fatigue<symptom> , Pain Interference , Physical Function , Sleep Disturbance , and Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities. Online survey of a US nationally representative sample ( n = 983). Preferences for PROMIS health states were elicited with the standard gamble to obtain both single-attribute scoring functions for each of the 7 PROMIS domains and a multiplicative multiattribute utility ( scoring) function. The 7 single-attribute scoring functions were fit using isotonic regression with linear interpolation. The multiplicative multiattribute summary function estimates utilities for PROMIS multiattribute health states on a scale where 0 is the utility of being dead and 1 the utility of `` full health. '' The lowest possible score is -0.022 ( for a state viewed as worse than dead) , and the highest possible score is 1. The online survey systematically excludes some subgroups , such as the visually impaired and illiterate. A generic societal preference-based scoring system is now available for all studies using these 7 PROMIS health domains.
