 Nitric oxide ( NO) is a highly potent radical with a wide spectrum of physiological activities. Depending on the concentration , it can enhance endothelial cell proliferation in a growth factor-free medium , mediate angiogenesis , accelerate wound<disease><symptom> healing , but may also lead to tumor progression or induce inflammation<symptom>. Due to its multifaceted role , NO must be administered at a right dose and at the specific site. Many efforts have focused on developing NO-releasing biomaterials; however , NO short half-life in human tissues only allows this molecule to diffuse over short distances , and significant challenges remain before the full potential of NO can be realized. Here , an overview of platforms that are engineered to release NO via catalytic or noncatalytic approaches is presented , with a specific emphasis on progress reported in the past five years. A number of NO donors , natural enzymes , and enzyme mimics are highlighted , and recent promising developments of NO-releasing scaffolds , particles , and films are presented. In particular , key parameters of NO delivery are discussed: 1) NO payload , 2) maximum NO flux , 3) NO release half-life , 4) time required to reach maximum flux , and 5) duration of NO release. Advantages and drawbacks are reviewed , and possible further developments are suggested.
