 Functional pain syndromes<disease><symptom> , such as fibromyalgia and temporomandibular disorder , are associated with enhanced catecholamine tone and decreased levels of catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT; an enzyme that metabolizes catecholamines). Consistent with clinical syndromes<disease><symptom> , our lab has shown that sustained 14-day delivery of the COMT inhibitor OR486 in rodents results in pain at multiple body sites and pain-related volitional behaviors. The onset of COMT-dependent functional pain is mediated by peripheral Î²
