 In a recent study using a standard additive genetic model , we identified a TBC1D4 loss-of-function variant with a large recessive impact on risk of type 2 diabetes in Greenlanders. The aim of the current study was to identify additional genetic variation underlying type 2 diabetes using a recessive genetic model , thereby increasing the power to detect variants with recessive effects. We investigated three cohorts of Greenlanders ( B99 , n = 1401; IHIT , n = 3115; and BBH , n = 547) , which were genotyped using Illumina MetaboChip. Of the 4674 genotyped individuals passing quality control , 4648 had phenotype data available , and type 2 diabetes association analyses were performed for 317 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 2631 participants with normal glucose tolerance. Statistical association analyses were performed using a linear mixed model. Using a recessive genetic model , we identified two novel loci associated with type 2 diabetes in Greenlanders , namely rs870992 in ITGA1 on chromosome 5 ( OR 2.79 , p = 1.8 Ã— 10 We demonstrate the value of using a recessive genetic model in a historically small and isolated population to identify genetic risk variants. Our findings give new insights into the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes , and further support the existence of high-effect genetic risk factors of potential clinical relevance , particularly in isolated populations.
