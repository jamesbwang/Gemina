 The immunomodulatory pro-drug FTY720 , which acts as an agonist for S1P receptors ( S1PR) when phosphorylated , is proposed as a novel pain therapeutic. Here we assessed FTY720-mediated antinociception in the radiant heat tail-flick test and in the chronic constriction injury ( CCI) model of neuropathic pain in mice. FTY720 produced antinociception and anti-allodynia , respectively , and these effects were dose-dependent and mimicked by the S1PR1 selective agonist CYM-5442. Repeated administration of FTY720 for one week produced tolerance to acute thermal antinociception , but not to anti-allodynia in the CCI model. S1PR-stimulated (
