 Autophagy is a process the primary role of which is to clear up damaged cellular components such as long-lived proteins and organelles , thus participating in the conservation of different cells. Osteoporosis associated with aging is characterized by consistent changes in bone metabolism with suppression of bone formation as well as increased bone resorption. In advanced age , not only bone mass but also bone strength decrease in both sexes , resulting in an increased incidence of fractures. Clinical and animal experiments reveal that age-related bone loss is associated with many factors such as accumulation of autophagy , increased levels of reactive oxygen species , sex hormone deficiency , and high levels of endogenous glucocorticoids. Available basic and clinical studies indicate that age-associated factors can regulate autophagy. Those factors play important roles in bone remodeling and contribute to decreased bone mass and bone strength with aging. In this review , we summarize the mechanisms involved in bone metabolism related to aging and autophagy , supplying a theory for therapeutic targets to rescue bone mass and bone strength in older people.
