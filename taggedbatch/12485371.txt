 Intracellular calcium overload is known to be a precipitating factor of pancreatic cell injury in acute pancreatitis<disease> ( AP). Intracellular calcium homeostasis depends of Plasmatic Membrane Calcium ATPase ( PMCA) , Sarcoplasmic Endothelial Reticulum Calcium ATPase 2 ( SERCA 2) and the Sodium Calcium Exchanger ( NCX1). The antioxidant melatonin ( Mel) and Trisulfate Disaccharide ( TD) that accelerates NCX1 action could reduce the cell damage determined by the AP. To evaluate m-RNA expressions of SERCA2 and NCX1 in acute pancreatitis<disease> induced by sodium taurocholate in Wistar rats pre-treated with melatonin and/or TD. Wistar rats were divided in groups: 1) without AP; 2) AP without pre-treatment; 3) AP and Melatonin; 4) AP and TD; 5) AP and Melatonin associated to TD. Pancreatic tissue samples were collected for detection of SERCA2 and NCX1 m-R NA levels by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR). Increased m-RNA expression of SERCA2 in the melatonin treated group , without increase of m-RNA expression of the NCX1. The TD did not affect levels of SERCA2 and NCX1 m-RNA expressions. The combined melatonin and TD treatment reduced the m-RNA expression of SERCA2. The effect of melatonin is restricted to increased m-RNA expression of SERCA2. Although TD does not affect gene expression , its action in accelerating calcium exchanger function can explain the slightest expression of SERCA2 m-RNA when associated with Melatonin , perhaps by a joint action of drugs with different and but possibly complementary mechanisms.
