 Despite the discovery of key pattern recognition receptors and CD4 + T cell subsets in laboratory mice , there is ongoing discussion of the value of murine models to reflect human<disease> disease<disease>. Pneumocystis<pathogen> is an AIDS-defining illness , in which risk of infection is inversely correlated with peripheral CD4 + T cell counts. Due to medical advances in the control of HIV<pathogen> , the current epidemiology of Pneumocystis<pathogen> infection is predominantly due to primary human immunodeficiencies and immunosuppressive therapies. To this end , we found that every human genetic immunodeficiency associated with Pneumocystis<pathogen> infection that has been tested in mice recapitulated susceptibility. For example , humans with a loss-of-function IL21R mutation are severely immunocompromised. We found that IL-21R , in addition to CD4 + T cell intrinsic STAT3 signaling , were required for generating protective antifungal class-switched antibody responses , as well as effector T cell-mediated protection. Furthermore , CD4 + T cell intrinsic IL-21R/ STAT3 signaling was required for CD4 + T cell effector responses , including IL-22 production. Recombinant IL-22 administration to Il21r-/- mice induced the expression of a fungicidal peptide , cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide , which showed in vitro fungicidal activity. In conclusion , SPF laboratory mice faithfully replicate many aspects of human primary immunodeficiency and provide useful tools to understand the generation and nature of effector CD4 + T cell immunity.
