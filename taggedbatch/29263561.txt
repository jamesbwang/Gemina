 The evolution of Greenland glaciers in a warming climate depends on their depth below sea level , flow speed , surface melt , and ocean-induced undercutting at the calving front. We present an innovative mapping of bed topography in the frontal regions of Sermeq Avannarleq and Kujalleq , two major glaciers flowing into the ice-choked Torssukatak Fjord , central west<disease> Greenland. The mapping combines a mass conservation algorithm inland , multibeam echo sounding data in the fjord , and high-resolution airborne gravity data at the ice-ocean transition where other approaches have traditionally failed. We obtain a reliable , precision ( Â± 40 m) solution for bed topography across the ice-ocean boundary. The results reveal a 700 m deep fjord that abruptly ends on a 100-300 m deep sill along the calving fronts. The shallow sills explain the presence of stranded icebergs , the resilience of the glaciers to ocean-induced undercutting by warm Atlantic water , and their remarkable stability over the past century.
