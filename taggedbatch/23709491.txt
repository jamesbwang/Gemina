 Breast cancer remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Human papilloma virus 16 ( HPV16) may serve a function in the pathogenesis and development of breast cancer. However , the detection rate of HPV16 in breast carcinoma may vary by region. In the present study , the expression of HPV16 E7 in paraffin-embedded tissues from patients with breast cancer from North China was detected. Additionally , the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of HPV16 E7 in the proliferation of breast cancer cells were examined. The results demonstrated that the DNA of HPV16 E7 was detected in 30.5 % of the samples , and that HPV16 E7 promoted the proliferation of breast cancer cells
