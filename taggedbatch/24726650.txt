 Hypereosinophilic syndrome<disease><symptom> is defined as persistent eosinophilia ( > 1500/ÂµL for more than six months) associated with organ involvement , excluding secondary causes. It is a rare , potentially lethal disease that should be considered in cutaneous conditions associated with hypereosinophilia. We report a case of erythroderma as a manifestation of hypereosinophilic syndrome<disease><symptom>. A 36-year-old male with no comorbidities presented progressive erythroderma , pruritus , peripheral neuropathy , and eosinophilia in the previous seven months. No mutations were found in FIP1L1/PDGFRA. Patient experienced rapid remission in response to oral prednisone and hydroxyurea. Cutaneous manifestations may be the only evidence of hypereosinophilic syndrome<disease><symptom>. Genotyping excludes myeloproliferative disease , thereby orienting treatment and prognosis.
