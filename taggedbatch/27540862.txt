 Ferulate-mediated cross-linking of plant cell wall polymers has various implications on the quality of plant based food products , forage digestibility , and biomass utilization. Besides dehydrodiferulic acids ( DFA) , dehydrotriferulic acids ( TriFA) gained increasing interest over the past two decades , because they potentially cross-link up to three polymers. Here , we describe a separation strategy to obtain several TriFA as analytical standard compounds from a reaction mixture after radical coupling of ethyl ferulate. By using silica flash chromatography , Sephadex LH-20 chromatography , and reversed phase HPLC , six known TriFA as well as three previously unidentified ferulic acid trimers were obtained , and their structures were characterized by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy (
