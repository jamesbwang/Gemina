 Cellulolytic bacteria that produce cellulases , which are active over a range of pH and temperatures , can be used to catalyze hydrolysis of pretreated lignocellulosic material. This is important in the production of second generation biofuels among other biotechnological applications. In this investigation , bacteria isolated from sugarcane bagasse were identified as strains of
