 Although airborne fungal diversity in tropical countries is known to be considerable , aerobiological research to-date has identified only a part of the fungal mycobiota that may have an impact both on human health and on crops. Previous studies in Havana city identified only 30 genera and 5 spore types; therefore , new research is required in these latitudes. This study sought to investigate airborne spore levels in Havana , with a view to learning more about local fungal diversity and assessing its influence in quantitative terms. A Hirst type volumetric sampler was located on the rooftop of a building 35 meters above ground level , in a busy area of the city. Sampling was carried out continuously ( operating 24hours/day) , at 10 L per minute during the year 2015. The fungal spores were collected on a Melinex tape coated with a 2 % silicone solution. The results were expressed as spores per cubic meter ( spores/m <sup> 3 </sup>) of air when to referring to daily values , and spores count if referring to annual value. Fourteen new genera were identified in the course of volumetric sampling: six produce ascospores and eight conidia. Morphobiometric characteristics were noted for all genera , and airborne concentrations were calculated. These genera accounted for 56.4 % of relative fungal frequency over the study year. Many airbone fungi<pathogen> are primary causes of both respiratory<disease> disease<disease> and crop damage. These new findings constitute a major contribution to Cuba 's aerobiological database.
