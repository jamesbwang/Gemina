 In the forensic discipline of bloodstain pattern analysis , it has been suggested that there is a blurred boundary between characterising the features of a bloodstain pattern and determining the mechanism ( s) that led to its deposition. This study proposes that bloodstain pattern classification can become a distinct and logical process by implementing an automated approach. To do this , an automated bloodstain pattern recognition system was developed to enable the distinction of two types of spatter bloodstain patterns. First , global pattern features based on common bloodstain pattern properties were extracted from laboratory-generated impact spatter and cast-off bloodstain patterns. Following this , automated feature selection methods were used to identify the combination of features that best distinguished the two bloodstain pattern types. This eventually led to the training and testing of a Fisher quadratic discriminant classifier using separate subsets of the generated bloodstain patterns. When applied to the training dataset , a 100 % classification precision resulted. An independent dataset comprising of bloodstain patterns generated on paint and wallpaper substrates were used to validate the performance of the classifier. An error rate of 2 % was obtained when the classifier was applied to these bloodstain patterns. This automated bloodstain pattern recognition system offers considerable promise as an objective classification methodology which up to now , the discipline has lacked. With further refinement , including testing it over a wider range of bloodstain patterns , it could provide valuable quantitative data to support analysts in their task of classifying bloodstain patterns.
