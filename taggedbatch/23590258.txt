 We use two pore-forming proteins , alpha-hemolysin and aerolysin , to compare the polymer size-dependence of ionic current block by two types of ethyleneglycol polymers: 1) linear and 2) 3-arm star poly ( ethylene glycol) , both applied as a polydisperse mixture of average mass 1kDa under high salt conditions. The results demonstrate that monomer size sensitivity , as known for linear PEGs , is conserved for the star polymers with only subtle differences in the dependence of the residual conductance on monomer number. To explain this absence of a dominant effect of polymer architecture , we propose that PEG adsorbs to the inner pore wall in a collapsed , salted-out state , likely due to the effect of hydrophobic residues in the pore wall on the availability of water for hydration.
