 A simple , rapid , reliable and sensitive method based on liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection ( LC-FL) for the quantification of doxorubicin ( DOX) in human plasma and urine samples was developed. The assay was carried out after the solid-phase extraction procedure ( SPE) with hydrophilic-lipophilic balance<symptom> ( HLB) cartridges , and with daunorubicin hydrochloride ( DAU) used as the internal standard. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Discovery HS C18 column in isocratic elution mode , and the detection of the analytes set at excitation and emission wavelengths of 487 and 555 nm , respectively. The developed LC-FL method has been validated for accuracy , precision , selectivity , linearity , recovery and stability. The limits of detection and quantification for DOX were 0.5 and 1 ng/mL in both biological fluids , respectively. Linearity was confirmed in the range of 1-1000 ng/mL and 0.001-25 Î¼g/mL in plasma and urine samples , respectively , with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9994. The proposed LC-FL method is selective , precise and accurate , and has been successfully applied for drug monitoring in pediatric cancer patients treated with DOX as a component of OEPA ( Oncovin ( Vincristine)- Etoposide-Prednisone-Adriamycin) and IOA ( Ifosfamide-Oncovin-Adriamycin) chemotherapeutic schemes. Moreover , real exposure of hospital personnel to the anthracycline drugs in plasma and urine was evaluated in clinical practice.
