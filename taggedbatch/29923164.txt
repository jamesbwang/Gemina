 Portal vein thrombosis ( PVT) is caused by several conditions including infection , malignancies , surgery , medications , and coagulation disorders. However , PVT caused by low-energy injury is very rare. A 51-year-old man visited a clinic with a 2-day history of abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> following blunt abdominal trauma. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography ( CT) revealed thrombosis in both the portal vein and splenic vein , and he was transferred to our hospital with a diagnosis of PVT. Anticoagulant therapy was initiated using unfractionated heparin. A repeat CT scan revealed enlargement of the thrombus , which occluded the main trunk and first right branch of the portal vein. Laboratory data before heparin administration suggested low protein C activity. Anticoagulation therapy was continued with intermittent assessment of the size of the thrombus and degree of coagulation. On day 23 , enhanced CT showed marked shrinkage of the thrombus compared with that on day 8. On day 30 , the patient was discharged with a therapeutic prothrombin time-international normalized ratio. Here we present a case of PVT caused by low-energy trauma of the upper abdomen in a patient with a background of low protein C activity that was successfully treated without invasive surgery.
