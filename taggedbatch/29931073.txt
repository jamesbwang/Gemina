 Bacterial transcription termination proceeds via two main mechanisms triggered either by simple , well-conserved ( intrinsic) nucleic acid motifs or by the motor protein Rho. Although bacterial genomes can harbor hundreds of termination signals of either type , only intrinsic terminators are reliably predicted. Computational tools to detect the more complex and diversiform Rho-dependent terminators are lacking. To tackle this issue , we devised a prediction method based on Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis ( OPLS-DA) of a large set of in vitro termination data. Using previously uncharacterized genomic sequences for biochemical evaluation and OPLS-DA , we identified new Rho-dependent signals and quantitative sequence descriptors with significant predictive value. Most relevant descriptors specify features of transcript C > G skewness , secondary structure , and richness in regularly-spaced 5 ` CC/UC dinucleotides that are consistent with known principles for Rho-RNA interaction. Descriptors collectively warrant OPLS-DA predictions of Rho-dependent termination with a âˆ¼ 85 % success rate. Scanning of the Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> genome with the OPLS-DA model identifies significantly more termination-competent regions than anticipated from transcriptomics and predicts that regions intrinsically refractory to Rho are primarily located in open reading frames. Altogether , this work delineates features important for Rho activity and describes the first method able to predict Rho-dependent terminators in bacterial genomes.
