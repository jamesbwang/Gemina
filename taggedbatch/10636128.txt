 Spinal Schwannomas are benign nerve sheath tumors and the most common intradural extramedullary tumors of the spine , mainly occurring in the cervical and lumbar region. The location distinct from the spinal canal is very rare. We report a rare case of a 45 year old male with Schwannoma in the dorsal paraspinal musculature. Complete surgical excision of the lesion<symptom> was performed with clear margins and neuropathological analysis revealed a Schwannoma. There has been no recurrence after 6 months.
