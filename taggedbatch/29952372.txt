 This study aimed to identify the best graft-to-pulmonary artery ( PA) anastomosis angle measuring pulmonary blood flow , wall shear stress ( WSS) , and shunt flow. A tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia computer model was used to study three different modified Blalock-Taussig shunt ( mBTS) anastomosis angle configurations with three different PA diameter configurations. Velocity and WSS were analyzed , and the flow rates at the right PA ( RPA) and left PA ( LPA) were calculated. A 4-mm and 8-mm diameter of RPA and LPA , respectively with vertical shunt angle produces the highest total flow. In the RPA larger diameter than the LPA configutations , the left-leaning shunt produces the lowest total PA flow whereas in the LPA larger diameter than the RPA configuratios , the right-leaning shunt produces the lowest total PA flow. Therefore , the shunt anastomosis should not be leaned through the narrow side of PA to reach best flow. As the flow inside the shunt increased , WSS also increased due to enhanced velocity gradients. The anastomosis angle between the conduit and PA affects the flow to PA.. Vertical anastomosis configurations increase the total PA flow; thus , these configurations are preferable than the leaned configurations.
