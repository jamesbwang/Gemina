 The present study aimed to explore protective mechanisms of hypothermia<symptom> against mild cold and heat stress on highly proliferative homogeneous human Neural Precursor Cells ( NPCs) derived from Subventricular Zone ( SVZ) of human fetal brain. CD133 + ve enriched undifferentiated and differentiated human NPCs were exposed to heat stress at 42 Â°C. Then , Western-blot quantification was performed using Hsp-70 ( 70 kilodalton heat shock<symptom> proteins) recombinant protein. Finally , changes in pluripotency and Hsp-70 expression were measured using immunofluorescence staining and RT-qPCR ( Quantitative reverse transcription PCR) analysis , respectively. Heat stress resulted in abnormal neurospheres development. The apoptosis rate was enhanced during long-term in vitro culture of neurospheres. Neurogenic differentiation reduced and showed aberrent phenotypes during heat stress. After hypothermia<symptom> treatment significant improvement in neurospheres and neuronal cell morphology was observed. Mild-hypothermia treatment induces attenuated heat shock<symptom> response against heat stress resulting in induced HSP-70 expression that significantly improves structure and function of both undifferentiated human NPCs and differentiated neurons.
