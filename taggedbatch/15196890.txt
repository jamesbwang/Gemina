 8-Oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 ( OGG1) initiates the base excision repair pathway by removing one of the most abundant DNA lesions<symptom> , 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine ( 8-oxoG). Recent data showed that 8-oxoG not only is a pro-mutagenic genomic base lesion<symptom> , but also functions as an epigenetic mark and that consequently OGG1 acquire distinct roles in modulation of gene expression. In support , lack of functional OGG1 in Ogg1
