 Data on the relationship between gender and acute kidney injury ( AKI) in patients with myocardial infarction ( MI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) are conflicting and inconclusive. The contrast volume-to-estimated glomerular filtration rate ratio ( CV/GFR) was shown to predict AKI in patients with MI undergoing PCI. We assessed gender-based differences in AKI and evaluated the association between the CV/GFR and AKI in MI patients undergoing PCI. We retrospectively studied 4675 consecutive patients with MI who underwent PCI between January 2007 and December 2015. The incidence of AKI and CV/GFR in men and women were compared. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Women suffered more AKI than men ( 152 ( 10.5 %) women suffered AKI compared to 252 ( 7.8 %) men; p = 0.003). After adjustment for potential confounders , female gender was identified as an independent predictive factor for AKI. CV/GFR was higher in women ( 2.57 ± 1.95 in women vs. 2.25 ± 1.60 in men; p < 0.0001) and predicted AKI. AKI occurs more often in women than men with MI undergoing PCI. Female gender independently predicted AKI in our analysis. A high CV/GFR denotes a group of patients who are at higher risk of AKI after PCI. CV/GFR was significantly higher in women , which may help to explain their worse outcome as regards AKI.
