 Despite major advances in the contemporary management of peripheral arterial occlusive disease , acute ischemia of the lower limb is still characterized by an important morbidity , limb threat , and mortality , and continues to pose a challenge to the vascular surgeon. Ageing of the population increases the prevalence of acute<symptom> lower limb ischemia. The two principal etiologies of acute ischemia of the lower limbs are arterial embolism and in situ thrombosis of an atherosclerotic artery or of a bypass graft. Popliteal aneurysm<disease> thrombosis and vascular trauma are less common causes of severe<symptom> limb ischemia. Prompt recognition and treatment of acute<symptom> limb ischemia in an urgent setting are crucial , in order to shorten as much as possible the duration of the ischemia. This paper highlights diagnostic work-up ( staging of the severity of ischemia) and appropriate management of acute ischemia of the lower limb. Different procedures of revascularization ( operative clot removal , catheter-directed thrombolysis , bypass grafting are evaluated and their outcome results are compared.
