 The aim of this study was to compare the results of serological assays using pneumococcal proteins or polysaccharides for the detection of pneumococcal infection in childhood pneumonia<disease>. Serological assays measured IgG against eight pneumococcal proteins ( Ply,CbpA,PspA1,PspA2,PcpA,PhtD,StkP-C , PcsB-N) , C-polysaccharide ( in the whole study population , n = 183) , or 19 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides ( 1,2,4,5,6 B ,7 F ,8,9 V ,10 A ,11 A ,12 F ,14,15 B ,17 F ,18 C ,19 F ,20,23 F ,33 F) ( only in a subgroup of patients , n = 53) in paired serum samples of children aged < 5 years-old hospitalized with clinical and radiological diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia<disease>. We also performed an inhibition of binding test with the anti-capsular polysaccharide assay in order to confirm the specificity of the antibody responses detected. Invasive pneumococcal pneumonia<disease> was investigated by blood culture and PCR ( ply-primer). Among 183 children , the anti-protein assay detected antibody response in 77/183 ( 42.1 %) patients and the anti-C-polysaccharide assay in 28/183 ( 15.3 %) patients. In a subgroup of 53 children , the anti-protein assay detected response in 32/53 ( 60.4 %) patients , the anti-C-polysaccharide assay in 11/53 ( 20.8 %) patients , and the anti-capsular polysaccharide in 25/53 ( 47.2 %) patients. Simultaneous antibody responses against â‰¥ 2 different capsular polysaccharides were detected in 11/53 ( 20.8 %) patients and this finding could not be explained by cross-reactivity between different serotypes. Among 13 patients with invasive pneumococcal pneumonia<disease> , the sensitivity of the anti-protein assay was 92.3 % ( 12/13) , of the anti-C-polysaccharide assay 30.8 % ( 4/13) , and of the anti-capsular polysaccharide assay 46.2 % ( 6/13). The serological assay using pneumococcal proteins is more sensitive for the detection of pneumococcal infection in children with pneumonia<disease> than the assay using pneumococcal polysaccharides. Future studies on childhood pneumonia<disease> aetiology should consider applying serological assays using pneumococcal proteins.
