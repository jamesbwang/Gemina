 A total of 261 individuals of the four tropical eel species , Anguilla celebesensis , Anguilla marmorata , Anguilla bicolor pacifica and Anguilla interioris , were collected from 12 locations around Sulawesi Island , Indonesia , to gain knowledge about the riverine distribution of tropical eels. Anguilla marmorata was predominant in the lower reaches of Poso River ( 94 · 4 % of total eel catch in the sampling area) , Poso Lake ( 93 · 3 %) , three small inlet rivers of Tomini Bay ( 100 %) and Laa River ( 92 · 3 %). Anguilla celebesensis occurred frequently in the inlet rivers of Poso Lake ( 63 · 5 %). Anguilla bicolor pacifica and Anguilla interioris were rare ( 1.5 % and 0.4 % , respectively). Otolith Sr: Ca ratio electron-probe micro analysis ( EPMA) for individual migratory histories revealed that 15 A. celebesensis caught in Poso Lake and its inlet rivers were categorized into 14 river eels ( Sr: Ca < 2 · 5) showing upstream migration seemingly at their elver stage and only one sea eel ( Sr: Ca ≥ 6 · 0) that stayed in the marine habitat for the majority of its life after recruiting to Sulawesi Island before its late upstream migration. In A. marmorata , 19 examined eels from Poso Lake and its inlet rivers were all river eels , while 17 eels from the lower reaches of Poso River were two river eels , six sea eels and nine estuarine eels ( 2 · 5 ≤ Sr: Ca < 6 · 0) that mostly lived in the brackish water. The sex ratio of A. celebesensis was highly skewed towards a dominance of females ( 99 %). In A. marmorata , females were predominant in Poso Lake ( 95 · 2 %) , its inlet rivers ( 94 · 7 %) and Laa River ( 100 %) , while males were more frequent in the lower reaches of Poso River ( 76 · 5 %) and small inlet rivers of Tomini Bay ( 94 · 1 %). These results indicate that the riverine distribution pattern of tropical eels differs among species and between sexes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
