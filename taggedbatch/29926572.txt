 Venous thromboembolism is the third cardiovascular disease in Europe. The cornerstone of the treatment of deep vein thrombosis is anticoagulation. It aims at avoiding harmful complications: thrombosis extension and recurrence , pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome<disease><symptom>. Due to low molecular weight heparins , and recently , to direct oral anticoagulants , most of the patients can get treatment as outpatients. Unfortunately , despite guideline publications , the management of these patients may be complicated in real life and not correspond to evidence-based medicine. This paper aims at helping the practitian when dealing with this potentially dangerous and often misleading disease. The management of the patient after a 3 to 6-month coagulation treatment will be discussed later in a dedicated paper.
