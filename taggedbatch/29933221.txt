 The enantiomeric separation of a racemate of 7-oxa-bicyclo ( 2.2.1) heptene sulfonate ( OBHS) derivatives , a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator ( SERM) , was obtained using supercritical fluid chromatography in tandem with UV and mass spectrometry ( SFC/UV and SFC/MS , respectively). Supercritical CO
