 The influence of the macromolecular reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer ( macro-RAFT) agent<pathogen> architecture on the morphology of the self-assemblies obtained by aqueous RAFT dispersion polymerization in polymerization-induced self-assembly ( PISA) is studied by comparing amphiphilic AB diblock , ( AB)
