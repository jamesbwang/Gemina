 We introduce a coupled dipstick and microscopy device for analyzing urine samples. The device is capable of accurately assessing urine dipstick results while simultaneously imaging the microscopic contents within the sample. We introduce a long working distance , cellphone-based microscope in combination with an oblique illumination scheme to accurately visualize and quantify particles within the urine sample. To facilitate accurate quantification , we couple the imaging set-up with a power-free filtration system. The proposed device is reusable , low-cost , and requires very little power. We show that results obtained with the proposed device and custom-built app are consistent with those obtained with the standard clinical protocol , suggesting the potential clinical utility of the device.
