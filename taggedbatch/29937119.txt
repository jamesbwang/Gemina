 8-Aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate ( APTS) is one of the most frequently used reagent in capillary electrophoresis. Three sulfonate groups in APTS generate fast electrophoretic mobilities of derivatized glycans , therefore very suitable for CE-LIF applications. However , these groups also make separation with partition chromatography difficult. A novel column for hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography ( HILIC) with an anionic tetrazole functionalized polymer-based silica was examined for the separation of APTS-labeled glycans derived from specific glycoproteins. This separation mode has enhanced capability for the size resolution of neutral and acidic oligosaccharides. In addition , specific glycan isomers , which are usually difficult to separate with HILIC methods , were also separated. IgG-derived complex-type glycans that have an isomeric pair of monogalactosylated glycans , as well as differences in the number of galactose residues , are separable using this mode. We also utilized this column for the fractionation of APTS-labeled glycans from porcine thyroglobulin and examined their migration times with CE by co-migration with a mixture of glycoprotein glycans. Combinational modes of HILIC and anionic repulsion show promise for the separation and preparation of glycoprotein-derived glycans labeled with APTS.
