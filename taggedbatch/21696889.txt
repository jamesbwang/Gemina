 The neurotrophin nerve growth factor has a demonstrated role in pain transduction and pathophysiology. Two randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase 1 studies were conducted to evaluate safety , tolerability , and analgesic efficacy of single doses of tanezumab , a humanized anti-nerve growth factor monoclonal antibody , in chronic or acute<symptom> pain<symptom>. In the first study ( CL001) , patients with moderate<symptom> to severe<symptom> pain<symptom> from osteoarthritis ( OA) of the knee received a single intravenous infusion of tanezumab ( 3-1000 μg/kg) or placebo in a dose-escalation ( part 1; N = 42) or parallel-arm ( part 2; N = 79) study design. The second study ( CL002) was a placebo-controlled dose-escalation ( tanezumab 10-1000 μg/kg; N = 50) study in patients undergoing bunionectomy surgery. Adverse event rates were generally similar across treatments. Most adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and no patients discontinued as a result of adverse events. Adverse events of abnormal peripheral sensation were more common with higher doses of tanezumab ( ≥ 100 μg/kg) than with placebo. These were generally mild to moderate in severity. Tanezumab provided up to 12 weeks of effective analgesia for OA knee pain , with statistically significant improvements at doses ≥ 100 μg/kg ( The demonstration of a favorable safety profile and clinical efficacy in OA pain supports clinical development of tanezumab as a potential treatment for chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> conditions.
