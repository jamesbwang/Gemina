 Dual targeting of a nuclearly encoded protein into two different cell organelles is an exceptional event in eukaryotic cells. Yet , the frequency of such dual targeting is remarkably high in case of mitochondria and chloroplasts , the two endosymbiotic organelles of plant cells. In most instances , it is mediated by `` ambiguous '' transit peptides , which recognize both organelles as the target. A number of different approaches including in silico , in organello as well as both transient and stable in vivo assays are established to determine the targeting specificity of such transit peptides. In this review , we will describe and compare these approaches and discuss the potential role of this unusual targeting process. Furthermore , we will present a hypothetical scenario how dual targeting might have arisen during evolution.
