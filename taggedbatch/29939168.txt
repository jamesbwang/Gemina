 Erectile dysfunction ( ED) is defined as the inability to attain or keep an erection of the penis , and this has become a prevalent male sexual disorder. Rodents are employed by many studies to research the physiology/pathology of erectile function. Erectile function in rodents can be evaluated by measuring the intracavernosal pressure ( ICP). In practice , ICP can be monitored following electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerves ( CNs). The arterial pressure of the carotid artery ( the mean arterial pressure) is used as the reference for ICP. Using ICP recording protocols , many key parameters of erectile function can be measured from the ICP response curve. The ICP measurement provides more information than the apomorphine-induced penile erection test , and is cheaper than telemetric monitoring of the corpus spongiosum penis , making this method the most popular one to evaluate erectile function. However , compared to the easily-performed APO-induced erectile function test , successful ICP recordings require attention to detail , practice , and adherence to the operation method. In this work , an introduction to ICP recording in rats is provided to complement the procedure efficiently.
