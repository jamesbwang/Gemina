 An adequate maternal cobalamin status is crucial for fetal and infant neurodevelopment. Pregnancy-induced physiologic changes make evaluation of maternal cobalamin status in pregnancy difficult. We have investigated maternal cobalamin status during pregnancy in order to establish a maternal cobalamin concentration which secures an optimal infant cobalamin status during the first 6 mo of life. In an observational , prospective study , markers of cobalamin status including serum cobalamin , plasma total homocysteine ( tHcy) , and plasma methylmalonic acid ( MMA) were assessed in healthy pregnant women ( n = 114) from week 18 of pregnancy through 6 mo postpartum and related to infant cobalamin status at 6 mo.. Healthy , never-pregnant women aged 18-40 y ( n = 123) were included as controls. Compared to controls , all markers of cobalamin status were lower in pregnant women. Median serum cobalamin concentration progressively decreased from week 18 to week 36 of pregnancy ( 356 to 302 pmol/L , P < 0.001) and increased by > 40 % by 6 wk postpartum ( 518 pmol/L). The metabolic markers increased from week 18 of pregnancy to 6 wk postpartum: median plasma tHcy 3.9 to 7.7 μmol/L ( P < 0.001) , and MMA 0.13 to 0.17 μmol/L ( P < 0.001). The serum cobalamin concentration of infants at age 6 mo correlated with maternal serum cobalamin concentration during pregnancy and postpartum ( rho = 0.36-0.55 , P < 0.001). A maternal serum cobalamin concentration < 394 pmol/L during week 18 of pregnancy was associated with an increased risk ( OR: 4.2; 95 % CI: 1.5 , 11.5) of infant biochemical cobalamin deficiency at 6 mo ( defined as tHcy ≥ 6.5 μmol/L). The maternal serum cobalamin concentration in early pregnancy is a strong predictor for later maternal and infant cobalamin status. To secure an optimal infant cobalamin status during the first 6 mo of life , we recommend a maternal serum cobalamin concentration > 394 pmol/L at week 18 of pregnancy. This should be confirmed in an intervention study. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03272022.
