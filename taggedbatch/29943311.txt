 This commentary reports on a forum held in October 2017 in Hobart , Tasmania , attended by 20 Australasian medical physicists , to consider the future role of medical physics , as well as non-medical physics and allied disciplines , in oncology research. Attendees identified important areas of oncology research which physicists can be contributing to , with these evaluated in the context of a set of `` Provocative Questions '' recently generated by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. Primary perceived barriers to participation in research were identified , including a `` lack of knowledge of cancer science '' , together with potential solutions. Mechanisms were considered for engagement with the broader scientific community , consumers , advocates and policy makers. In considering future opportunities in oncology research for medical physicists , it was noted that a professional need to focus on the safety and accuracy of current treatments applied to patients , encouraging risk-aversion , is somewhat in competition with the role of physical scientists in the exploration and discovery of new concepts and understandings.
