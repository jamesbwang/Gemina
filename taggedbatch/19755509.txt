 The present study investigated the molecular mechanism by which the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) inhibitor cetuximab enhances the antitumor activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK) inhibitor AZD6244 in colorectal cancer HT29 cells. HT29 cells were treated with AZD6244 plus cetuximab and then subjected to the following assays: Cell Counting kit-8 , BrdU-incorporation , flow cytometric cell cycle distribution and apoptosis analysis , western blot analysis , and nude mouse xenografts. The combination of AZD6244 and cetuximab significantly reduced HT29 cell viability and proliferation compared with AZD6244 alone. The combination treatment reduced the IC
