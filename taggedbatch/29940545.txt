 Diabetes mellitus is currently a serious public health problem worldwide , that increases the risk of presenting microvascular and macrovascular complications. Although achieving the recommended blood glucose goals reduces the risk of microvascular complications , the effect of the drugs used to treat hyperglycemia on macrovascular complications and cardiovascular death is a cause for concern. In this context , the regulatory agencies have modified the regulations for the approval of new drugs in diabetes , by adding the need to demonstrate that they are capable of lowering blood glucose levels together with a solid assessment of cardiovascular safety. The objective of this study is to review the cardiovascular effects of the new families of non-insulin drugs , with special emphasis on their effect on the risk of major cardiovascular events. In recent years , it has finally been confirmed that some of the drugs used to treat diabetes are not only safe from a cardiovascular point of view , but have even shown capacity to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The evidence obtained determined the updating of some current therapeutic guidelines when cardiovascular risk should be considered a fundamental variable at the time of therapeutic choice in patients with diabetes.
