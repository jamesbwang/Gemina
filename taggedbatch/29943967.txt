 Acute liver failure is a critical condition characterized by global hepatocyte death and often time needs a liver transplantation. Such treatment is largely limited by donor organ shortage. Stem cell therapy offers a promising option to patients with acute liver failure. Yet , therapeutic efficacy and feasibility are hindered by delivery route and storage instability of live cell products. We fabricated a nanoparticle that carries the beneficial regenerative factors from mesenchymal stem cells and further coated it with the membranes<symptom> of red blood cells to increase blood stability. Unlike uncoated nanoparticles , these particles promote liver cell proliferation in vitro and have lower internalization by macrophage cells. After intravenous delivery , these artificial stem cell analogs are able to remain in the liver and mitigate carbon tetrachloride-induced liver failure in a mouse model , as gauged by histology and liver function test. Our technology provides an innovative and off-the-shelf strategy to treat liver failure.
