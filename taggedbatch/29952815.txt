 Despite clinical use spanning 50 + years , questions remain concerning the optimal use of mannitol. The published reviews with meta-analysis frequently focused on mannitol 's effects on a specific physiological aspect such as intracranial pressure ( ICP) in sometimes heterogeneous patient populations. A comprehensive review of mannitol 's effects , as well as side effects , is needed. The databases Medline ( OvidSP) , Embase ( OvidSP) , and NLM PubMed were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) comparing mannitol to a control therapy in either the critical care or perioperative setting. Meta-analysis was performed when feasible to examine mannitol 's effects on outcomes , including ICP , cerebral perfusion pressure , mean arterial pressure ( MAP) , brain relaxation , fluid intake , urine output , and serum sodium. Systematic literature search was also performed to understand mannitol-related complications. In total 55 RCTs were identified and 7 meta-analyses were performed. In traumatic brain injury , mannitol did not lead to significantly different MAP ( SMD ( 95 % confidence interval) , CI) = -3.3 ( -7.9 , 1.3) mm Hg; P = 0.16) but caused significantly different serum sodium concentrations ( SMD ( 95 % CI) = -8.0 ( -11.0 , -4.9) mmol/L; P < 0.00001) compared with hypertonic saline. In elective craniotomy , mannitol was less likely to lead to satisfactory brain relaxation ( RR ( 95 % CI) = 0.89 ( 0.81 , 0.98); P = 0.02) , but was associated with increased fluid intake ( SMD ( 95 % CI) = 0.67 ( 0.21 , 1.13) L; P = 0.004) , increased urine output ( SMD ( 95 % CI) = 485 ( 211 , 759) mL; P = 0.0005) , decreased serum sodium concentration ( SMD ( 95 % CI) = -6.2 ( -9.6 , -2.9) mmol/L; P = 0.0002) , and a slightly higher MAP ( SMD ( 95 % CI) = 3.3 ( 0.08 , 6.5) mm Hg; P = 0.04) compared with hypertonic saline. Mannitol could lead to complications in different organ systems , most often including hyponatremia , hyperkalemia , and acute kidney injury. These complications appeared dose dependent and had no long-term consequences. Mannitol is effective in accomplishing short-term clinical goals , although hypertonic saline is associated with improved brain relaxation during craniotomy. Mannitol has a favorable safety profile although it can cause electrolyte abnormality and renal impairment. More research is needed to determine its impacts on long-term outcomes.
