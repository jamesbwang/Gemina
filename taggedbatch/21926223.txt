 Single stranded DNA viruses have been previously shown to populate the oceans on a global scale , and are endemic in microbialites of both marine and freshwater systems. We undertook for the first time direct viral metagenomic shotgun sequencing to explore the diversity of viruses in the modern stromatolites of Shark Bay Australia. The data indicate that Shark Bay marine stromatolites have similar diversity of ssDNA<pathogen> viruses to that of Highbourne Cay , Bahamas. ssDNA<pathogen> viruses in cluster uniquely in Shark Bay and Highbourne Cay , potentially due to enrichment by phi29-mediated amplification bias. Further , pyrosequencing data was assembled from the Shark Bay systems into two putative viral genomes that are related to
