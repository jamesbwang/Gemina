 Transient technology is deemed as a paramount breakthrough for its particular functionality that can be implemented at a specific time and then totally dissolved. Hyperbolic metamaterials ( HMMs) with high wave-vector modes for negative refraction or with high photonic density of states to robustly enhance the quantum transformation efficiency represent one of the emerging key elements for generating not-yet realized optoelectronics devices. However , HMMs has not been explored for implementing in transient technology. Here we show the first attempt to integrate transient technology with HMMs , i.e. , transient HMMs , composed of multilayers of water-soluble and bio-compatible polymer and metal. We demonstrate that our newly designed transient HMMs can also possess high-k modes and high photonic density of states , which enables to dramatically enhance the light emitter covered on top of HMMs. We show that these transient HMMs devices loss their functionalities after immersing into deionized water within 5 min. Moreover , when the transient HMMs are integrated with a flexible substrate , the device exhibits an excellent mechanical stability for more than 3000 bending cycles. We anticipate that the transient HMMs developed here can serve as a versatile platform to advance transient technology for a wide range of application , including solid state lighting , optical communication , and wearable optoelectronic devices , etc..
