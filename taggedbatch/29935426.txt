 While the benefit of temporal predictability on sensorimotor processing is well established , it is still unknown whether this is due to efficient execution of an appropriate response and/or inhibition of an inappropriate one. To answer this question , we examined the effects of temporal predictability in tasks that required selective ( Simon task) or global ( Stop-signal task) inhibitory control of prepotent responses. We manipulated temporal expectation by presenting cues that either predicted ( temporal cues) or not ( neutral cues) when the target would appear. In the Simon task , performance was better when target location ( left/right) was compatible with the hand of response and performance was improved further still if targets were temporally cued. However , Conditional Accuracy Functions revealed that temporal predictability selectively increased the number of fast , impulsive errors. Temporal cueing had no effect on selective response inhibition , as measured by the dynamics of the interference effect ( delta plots) in the Simon task. By contrast , in the Stop-signal task , Stop-signal reaction time , a covert measure of a more global form of response inhibition , was significantly longer in temporally predictive trials. Therefore , when the time of target onset could be predicted in advance , it was harder to stop the impulse to respond to the target. Collectively , our results indicate that temporal cueing compounded the interfering effects of a prepotent response on task performance. We suggest that although temporal predictability enhances activation of task-relevant responses , it impairs inhibition of prepotent responses.
