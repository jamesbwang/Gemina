 The Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set ( HEDIS) measurements assess glycaemic goal attainment in patients with type 2 diabetes , incorporating factors including age and health status. Healthier patients are assigned a glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c) goal of < 7 % ( low-risk ( LR)) and individuals aged > 65 years or with comorbidities are assigned a goal of < 8 % ( high-risk ( HR)). This post-hoc analysis assessed the safety and efficacy of iGlarLixi , a fixed-ratio combination of insulin glargine 100 U/mL ( iGlar) and lixisenatide , in 1898 patients from the phase 3 LixiLan-L and LixiLan-O clinical trials , retrospectively classified as LR ( n = 1181) or HR ( n = 717). iGlarLixi was more effective in reducing HbA1c than comparators in both LR and HR patients across the LixiLan-L trial ( change from baseline , 1.1 % vs -0.6 % for iGlar in both groups; P < 0.001) and the LixiLan-O trial ( change from baseline , LR/HR -1.6 %/ -1.4 % vs -1.3 %/ -1.2 % for iGlar and -0.8 %/ -0.9 % for lixisenatide; P < 0.01). iGlarLixi treatment significantly reduced postprandial glucose in both LR and HR patients ( P < 0.001). The incidence of hypoglycaemia did not differ between risk categories in any treatment group.
