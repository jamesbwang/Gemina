 To establish a method for the simultaneous determination of 9 components , namely gardenoside , paeoniflorin , forsythoside A , baicalin , forsythin , glycyrrhizic acid , rhein , honokiol , and magnolol in Xiao'er Chiqiao Qingre granules （ XECQ Gra ）. Ultra performance liquid chromatography ( UPLC) was used on an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 C ₁₈ column ( 2.1 mm × 100 mm , 1.8 μm) with 0.1 % phosphoric acid acetonitrile ( A) -0.1 % phosphoric acid solution ( B) as mobile phase for gradient elution. The flow rate was 0.3 mL · min ⁻¹; the column temperature was set at 30 °C , and the determination wavelength was set at 220 nm. All the 9 compounds were well separated , and showed good linear relationship within their concentrations ( r > = 0.999). The average recoveries were between 95.84 % -101.4 % and the RSD values were all less than 3.0 %. The method is simple , reliable , and accurate , and could be used for the quality control of XECQ Gra.
