 In this perspective , we describe our efforts to innovate the current isotope-aided NMR methodology to investigate biologically important large proteins and protein complexes , for which only limited structural information could be obtained by conventional NMR approaches. At the present time , it is widely believed that only backbone amide and methyl signals are amenable for investigating such difficult targets. Therefore , our primary mission is to disseminate our novel knowledge within the biological NMR community; specifically , that any type of NMR signals other than methyl and amide groups can be obtained , even for quite large proteins , by optimizing the transverse relaxation properties by isotope labeling methods. The idea of `` TROSY by isotope labeling '' has been cultivated through our endeavors aiming to improve the original stereo-array isotope labeling ( SAIL) method ( Kainosho et al. , Nature 440:52-57 , 2006). The SAIL TROSY methods subsequently culminated in the successful observations of individual NMR signals for the side-chain aliphatic and aromatic
