 Agastache rugosa<pathogen> ( Fisch. & C.A.Mey.) Kuntze ( Korean mint) is used to treat diverse types of human disorders in traditional medicine. In recent years , its non-fermented leaf extract ( ARE) has been shown to possess protective properties against ultraviolet-B ( UV-B) radiation-induced photooxidative stress. The present work aimed to examine whether probiotic bacterial fermentation would potentiate the skin anti-photoaging activity of ARE or not , by comparing the protective properties of ARE and corresponding fermented extract ( ARE-F) against UV-B radiation-induced photooxidative stress in HaCaT keratinocytes. ARE-F was produced from ARE by the fermentation with Lactobacillus<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> HK-9 , a type of Gram-positive probiotic bacterial strain. Anti-photoaging activities were evaluated by analyzing reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , promatrix metalloproteinases ( proMMPs) , total glutathione ( GSH) and total superoxide dismutase ( SOD) in UV-B-irradiated HaCaT keratinocytes. Antiradical activity was determined using 2,2-azino-bis ( 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) ( ABTS) radical scavenging assay. ARE-F contained higher attenuating activity on the UV-B-induced ROS generation than ARE. Similarly , ARE-F was able to diminish the UV-B-induced proMMP-9 and -2 more effectively than ARE. ARE-F displayed higher tendencies to augment the UV-B-reduced total GSH content and SOD activity than ARE. However , there were no significant difference between ARE and ARE-F in ABTS radical scavenging activities. The findings suggest that the UV-B radiation-protective activity of ARE is enhanced by probiotic bacterial fermentation , which might improve the therapeutic and cosmetic values of A. rugosa<pathogen> leaves.
