 This report describes the case of a 58-year-old man with moderate traumatic brain injury ( TBI) and pre-accident brain disorders who had multiple persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms. NeuroQuant 速 2.0 and NeuroGage 速 2.0 MRI brain volume analyses were used during the chronic stage of injury ( > 1 year after injury) to help understand the effects of the TBI on his brain volume. NeuroQuant 速 showed widespread cross-sectional atrophy , especially in the frontal and temporal lobes , consistent with encephalomalacia seen on the MRIs. Several of his clinical symptoms were consistent with the volume abnormalities. NeuroGage 速 longitudinal analyses of volume change from the time 1 to time 2 magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormally rapid atrophy and ventricular enlargement. The high rates of volume change were much more consistent with the relatively recent effects of TBI than with effects of the much more chronic pre-accident brain disorders.
