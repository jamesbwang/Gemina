 Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis ( ABPA) is a condition characterized by a Th2 response , serum eosinophilia , and increased total serum IgE to A retrospective study to investigate the efficacy of omalizumab in the treatment of ABPA in CF patients was conducted at 3 CF centers in Israel and Belgium. Data were obtained from the digital archive. We measured 4 outcome parameters: forced expiratory volume in 1 second , body mass index , pulmonary exacerbations , and steroid sparing. The database was composed on the records of 9 patients. None of the outcome parameters showed any improvement. A favorable outcome was observed in patients with higher levels of posttreatment total IgE than those with lower levels. CF-related diabetes and male gender showed trends for poorer outcomes. No benefits were detected on treating ABPA in CF with omlaizumb. Monitoring the total IgE was not helpful. A prospective randomized double-blind study is needed.
