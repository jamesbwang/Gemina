 Pancreatic pseudocyst is a complication that can arise in both acute and chronic pancreatitis<disease>. Overtime , this encapsulated enzyme-rich fluid collection may erode into surrounding vasculature and result in the formation of a pseudoaneurysm. Pseudoaneurysms can rupture into the gastrointestinal tract and present as upper , lower , and biliary bleeding. Evaluation of pancreatic pseudocysts involves computed tomography imaging or magnetic resonance imaging for both identification and monitoring. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD) and endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS) can be done to further visualize the lesion<symptom>. In the presence of gastrointestinal bleed , management involves the combination of interventional radiology and surgery.
