 Whether regulatory T cells ( Tregs) are involved in immune disorders of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA) patients after return of spontaneous circulation ( ROSC) is still unknown. We aimed to observe the expression of circulatory Tregs in OHCA patients and investigate programmed cell death-1 ( PD-1) and human leucocyte antigen-DR ( HLA-DR) on Tregs to evaluate the induction and activity of Tregs. Sixty-seven consecutive OHCA patients who recovered from spontaneous circulation over 12 h were enrolled. Clinical and 28-day outcome data were collected. Peripheral blood samples collected on days 1 and 3 after ROSC were analysed to evaluate PD-1 and HLA-DR expression on Tregs. Fifty healthy individuals were enrolled as healthy controls. Compared with those in healthy individuals , circulatory Treg counts significantly decreased without changes of Treg/cluster-of-differentiation ( CD) 4 + lymphocyte<symptom> ratios on day 1 after ROSC , and the percentage of PD-1 + Tregs and HLA-DR + Tregs significantly rose. On day 3 , Treg/CD4 + lymphocyte<symptom> ratios rose with persistently low Treg counts , and the expression of PD-1 and HLA-DR on Tregs was not different from that on day 1. On day 1 , both circulatory Treg counts and Treg/CD4 + lymphocyte<symptom> ratios in non-survivors were lower than those in survivors , and Treg/CD4 + lymphocyte<symptom> ratios increased in non-survivors on day 3. No significant difference of PD-1 and HLA-DR expression on Tregs was found between survivors and non-survivors on day 1. After ROSC , despite decreased circulatory Treg counts , a relative increase of Treg percentage and enhanced activity of Tregs are involved in early immune regulation of OHCA patients.
