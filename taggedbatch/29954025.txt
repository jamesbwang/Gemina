 The sagittal split osteotomy ( SSO) is an indispensable tool in the correction of dentofacial abnormalities. In elective orthognathic surgery , it is important that surgeons inform patients about the risk of complications related to inferior alveolar nerve damage and unfavorable split. The purpose of this article is to describe a novel , hybrid technique to SSO by combining a reciprocating saw and piezoelectric devices with several advantages over traditional `` pure '' methods ( osteotomies performed by reciprocating saw or piezoelectric devices only) in terms of precision , rapidity , easier splitting , and decreased complications related to inferior alveolar nerve damage and bad split with reduced overall morbidity. The level of evidence was Level IV , therapeutic study.
