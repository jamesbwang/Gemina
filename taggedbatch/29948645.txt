 Although spine surgery ( SS) and spinal<disease> cord stimulators ( SCSs) can provide significant relief for patients with intractable pain , their effectiveness is variable. Previously , a number of pre-operative psychosocial risk factors have predicted suboptimal outcomes of these procedures. However , recent research has found that `` patient activation ''- the extent to which patients are engaged and active in their own health care-can predict positive surgical results. The purpose of the current investigation was to determine whether patient activation helps explain associations between established psychosocial risk factors and suboptimal outcomes. Candidates for SS and SCS ( n = 1254; 56.3 % women , mean age 50.4 years) consented to participate in an outcome study prior to their pre-surgical psychological evaluation. Of those , 46.3 % returned self-report measures an average of 180 days ( SD = 79.1) post-surgery. Bootstrapped mediation analyses indicated that patient activation mediates numerous associations between psychosocial risk factors and suboptimal outcomes. That is , patients ' involvement in obtaining information , decision making , and their resilience can explain why some patients do not experience adverse surgical results when pre-surgical psychosocial risk factors are present. Pre-surgical psychological evaluations should include examination of patient strengths in addition to psychosocial risk factors , so that treatments can be appropriately individualized and the most effective surgical results obtained.
