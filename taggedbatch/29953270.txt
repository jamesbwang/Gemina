 This article describes a study of the phenomenon of supporting patients who are learning to live with diabetes , from a diabetes specialist nurse ( DSN) perspective. Guided by principles of reflective lifeworld research , data from six interviews ( four in groups and two individual) with 16 DSNs were analysed. The results show that , in order to support learning , DSNs use a self-critical approach with the insight that they should not take over responsibility for their patients ' diabetes. The DSNs support , encourage and challenge the patients to self-reflect and take responsibility based on patients ' own goals and needs. To provide support , DSNs need to assume a tactful , critically challenging approach , dare to confront patients ' fears and other emotions and have the insight to know that the responsibility for learning and integration of the condition lies with the patient. To be able to support patients in this way , it is necessary that the DSN is mentored and supported in this role.
