 Protein fusions are of fundamental importance in the study of cellular biology and the elucidation of cell signaling pathways , and the importance of linkers for the proper function of protein fusions is well documented in the literature. However , there are few convenient methods available to experimentalists for the systematic implementation of linkers in protein fusions. In this work , we describe a universal approach to the creation and insertion of focused linker libraries into protein fusions. This process , deemed protaTETHER , utilizes reiterative oligomer design , PCR-mediated linker library generation , and restriction enzyme-free cloning methods in a straightforward , three-step cloning process. We utilize a fusion between the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A ( PKAc) and green fluorescent protein ( GFP) for the development of the protaTETHER method , implementing small linker libraries that vary by length , sequence , and predicted secondary structural elements. We analyze the impact of linker length and sequence on the expression , activity , and subcellular localization of the PKAc-GFP fusions , and use these results to select a PKAc-GFP fusion construct with robust expression and enzymatic activity. Based upon the results of both biochemical experiments and molecular modeling , we determine that linker flexibility is more important than linker length for optimal kinase activity and expression.
