 In this report , a UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of aflatoxins , ochratoxin A , zearalenone , deoxynivalenol , fumonisins , T-2 and HT-2 toxins , fusarenone X , diacetoxyscirpenol , and 3- and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol in feedstuffs was developed. A quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer detector ( QTOF-MS) operating in full scan mode was combined with the UPLC-ESI-MS/MS system to confirm the identity of detected mycotoxins and to identify other possible microbial metabolites occurring in samples. Sixty-two feed samples from the Spanish market were analyzed. Extraction of metabolites was carried out with acetonitrile-water-formic acid ( 80:19:1 , v/v/v). Method detection and quantification limits and performance criteria set by Commission Regulation ( EC) No 401/2006 were fulfilled. Relatively high levels of the main regulated mycotoxins and presence of non-regulated mycotoxins in feed samples were found. This is the first study in which mycotoxins and other microbial metabolites occurring in feed are studied using a UPLC-QTOF-MS system being therefore a reference report.
