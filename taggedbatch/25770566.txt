 Phosphate-based glasses have been attracting attention due to their possible medical applications arising from unique dissolution characteristics in the human body leading to the possibility of new tissue regeneration. In this study , the leaching kinetics of a series of melt-quenched Sr-doped phosphate glasses are presented. Regardless of the presence of Sr , all the glasses have an initial linear and sustained release of the ions followed by a plateau. To guarantee proper nutritional support to the growing tissue during regeneration and to mimic the 3-dimensional architecture of tissues , organic scaffold systems have been developed. However , their poor mechanical strength has limited their application. To overcome this problem , cross-linkers can be used although this then limits the solubility of the materials. To succeed in dealing with such a limitation , in this paper , by freeze-drying , the aforementioned soluble melt-quenched phosphate glasses were combined as powders with collagen fibres from bovine achilles tendon to make degradable scaffolds. The scaffolds were characterized by SEM , EDX and BET. Changes to the dissolution behaviour of the glasses arising from the presence of collagen interacting with the ions leached were reported. Furthermore , the ability of the scaffolds to induce hydroxyapatite ( HA) formation was evaluated: one the elaborated scaffold could grow an HA-like layer after a week in SBF. Based on the results obtained , a possible application in restorative dentistry is proposed for one or more materials.
