 The purpose of this study was to compare core muscle activation during a prone bridge ( plank) until failure and 6-RM back squats. Twelve resistance-trained males ( age 23.5 ± 2.6 years , body mass 87.8 ± 21.3 kg , body height 1.81 ± 0.08 m) participated in this study. Total exercise time and EMG activity of the rectus<pathogen> abdominis , external abdominal oblique and erector spinae were measured during 6-RM back squats and a prone bridge with a weight of 20 % of participants ' body mass on their lower back. The main findings showed non-significant differences between the exercises in the rectus<pathogen> abdominis or external oblique , but greater erector spinae activation in squatting. Furthermore , in contrast to the prone bridge , the erector spinae and rectus<pathogen> abdominis demonstrated increasing muscle activation throughout the repetitions while squatting , whereas the prone bride demonstrated increasing external oblique activation between the beginning and the middle of the set. It was concluded that since squatting resulted in greater erector spine activation , but similar rectus<pathogen> abdominis and oblique external activation as the prone bridge , high-intensity squats rather than isometric low intensity core exercises for athletes would be recommended.
