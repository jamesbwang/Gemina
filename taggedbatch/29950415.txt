 EBV latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1) is released from latently infected tumor cells in small membrane-enclosed extracellular vesicles ( EVs). Accumulating evidence suggests that LMP1 is a major driver of EV content and functions. LMP1-modified EVs have been shown to influence recipient cell growth , migration , differentiation , and regulation of immune cell function. Despite the significance of LMP1-modified exosomes , very little is known about how this viral protein enters or manipulates the host EV pathway. In this study , LMP1 deletion mutants were generated to assess protein regions required for EV trafficking. Following transfection of LMP1 or mutant plasmids , EVs were collected by differential centrifugation and the levels of specific cargo were evaluated by immunoblot analysis. The results demonstrate that together the N-terminus and transmembrane region 1 of LMP1 are sufficient for efficient sorting into EVs. Consistent with these findings , a mutant lacking the N-terminus and transmembrane domains 1 through 4 ( TM5-6) failed to be packaged into EVs and exhibited higher co-localization with endoplasmic reticulum and early endosome markers when compared to the wild-type protein. Surprisingly , TM5-6 maintained the ability to co-localize and form a complex with CD63 , an abundant exosome protein that is important for the incorporation of LMP1 into EVs. Other mutations within LMP1 resulted in enhanced levels of secretion , alluding to potential positive and negative regulatory mechanisms for extracellular vesicle sorting of LMP1. These data suggest new functions of the N-terminus and transmembrane domains in LMP1 intra- and extra-cellular trafficking that are likely downstream of an interaction with CD63.
