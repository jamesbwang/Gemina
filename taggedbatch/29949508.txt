 The debate comparing the benefits of measurement uncertainty ( uncertainty in measurement , MU) with total error ( TE) for the assessment of laboratory performance continues. The summary recently provided in this journal by members of the Task and Finish Group on Total Error ( TFG-TE) of the EFLM put the arguments into clear perspective. Even though there is generally strong support for TE in many laboratories , some of the arguments proposed for its on-going support require further comment. In a recent opinion which focused directly on the TFG-TE summary , several potentially confusing statements regarding ISO15189 and the Evaluation of measurement data- Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement ( GUM) were again promulgated to promote TE methods for assessing uncertainty in laboratory measurement. In this opinion , we present an alternative view of the key issues and outline our views with regard to the relationship between ISO15189 , uncertainty in measurement and the GUM.
