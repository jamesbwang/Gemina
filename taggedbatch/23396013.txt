 Tuberous sclerosis complex-associated renal cell carcinoma ( TSC-RCC) has distinct clinical and histopathologic features and is considered a specific subtype of RCC. The genetic alterations of TSC1 or TSC2 are responsible for the development of TSC. In this study , we assessed the mTOR pathway activation and aimed to evaluate molecular characteristics and pathogenic pathways of TSC-RCC. Two cases of TSC-RCC , one from a 31-year-old female and the other from an 8-year-old male , were assessed. The mTOR pathway activation was determined by immunohistochemistry. The mutational spectrum of both TSC-RCCs was evaluated by whole exome sequencing ( WES) , and pathogenic pathways were analyzed. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed by NanoString Technologies nCounter platform. The mTOR pathway activation and the germline mutations of TSC2 were identified in both TSC-RCC cases. The WES revealed several cancer gene alterations. In Case 1 , genetic alterations of CHD8 , CRISPLD1 , EPB41L4A , GNA11 , NOTCH3 , PBRM1 , PTPRU , RGS12 , SETBP1 , SMARCA4 , STMN1 , and ZNRF3 were identified. In Case 2 , genetic alterations of IWS1 and TSC2 were identified. Further , putative pathogenic pathways included chromatin remodeling , G protein-coupled receptor , Notch signaling , Wnt/Î²-catenin , PP2A and the microtubule dynamics pathway in Case 1 , and mRNA processing and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in Case 2. Additionally , the ALK and CRLF2 mRNA expression was upregulated and CDH1 , MAP3K1 , RUNX1 , SETBP1 , and TSC1 mRNA expression was downregulated in both TSC-RCCs. We present mTOR pathway activation and molecular characteristics with pathogenic pathways in TSC-RCCs , which will advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of TSC-RCC.
