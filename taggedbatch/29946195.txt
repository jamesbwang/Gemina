 Hard ticks of the order Ixodidae serve as vectors for numerous human pathogens , including the causative agent of Lyme<disease> Disease<disease> Borrelia<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen>. Tick-associated microbes can influence pathogen colonization , offering the potential to inhibit disease transmission through engineering of the tick microbiota. Here , we investigate whether B.<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> encounters abundant bacteria within the midgut of wild adult Ixodes<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> , its primary vector. Through the use of controlled sequencing methods and confocal microscopy , we find that the majority of field-collected adult I.<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> harbor limited internal microbial communities that are dominated by endosymbionts. A minority of I.<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> ticks harbor abundant midgut bacteria and lack B.<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen>. We find that the lack of a stable resident midgut microbiota is not restricted to I.<pathogen> scapularis<pathogen> since extension of our studies to I.<pathogen> pacificus<pathogen> , Amblyomma<pathogen> maculatum<pathogen> , and Dermacentor<pathogen> spp showed similar patterns. Finally , bioinformatic examination of the B.<pathogen> burgdorferi<pathogen> genome revealed the absence of genes encoding known interbacterial interaction pathways , a feature unique to the Borrelia<pathogen> genus within the phylum Spirochaetes. Our results suggest that reduced selective pressure from limited microbial populations within ticks may have facilitated the evolutionary loss of genes encoding interbacterial competition pathways from Borrelia<pathogen>.
