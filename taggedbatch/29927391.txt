 The solid-state structure of star-shaped 2,4,6-tris ( ( E) -2- ( 4- ( dimethylamino)- phenyl) ethenyl) -1,3,5-triazine is determined from a powder sample by exploiting the respective strengths of single-crystal three-dimensional electron diffraction and powder X-ray diffraction data. The unit-cell parameters were determined from single crystal electron diffraction data. Using this information , the powder X-ray diffraction data were indexed , and the crystal structure was determined from the powder diffraction profile. The compound crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric space group , P2
