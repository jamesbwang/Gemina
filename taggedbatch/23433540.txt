 Hematuria<symptom> is associated with chronic kidney disease ( CKD) , but has rarely been examined as a risk factor for CKD progression. We explored whether individuals with hematuria<symptom> had worse outcomes compared to those without hematuria<symptom> in the CRIC Study. Participants were a racially and ethnically diverse group of adults ( 21 to 74 years) , with moderate CKD. Presence of hematuria<symptom> ( positive dipstick) from a single urine sample was the primary predictor. Outcomes included a 50 % or greater reduction in eGFR from baseline , ESRD , and death , over a median follow-up of 7.3 years , analyzed using Cox Proportional Hazards models. Net reclassification indices ( NRI) and C statistics were calculated to evaluate their predictive performance. Hematuria<symptom> was observed in 1145 ( 29 %) of a total of 3272 participants at baseline. Individuals with hematuria<symptom> were more likely to be Hispanic ( 22 % vs. 9.5 % , respectively) , have diabetes ( 56 % vs. 48 %) , lower mean eGFR ( 40.2 vs. 45.3 ml/min/1 .73 m2) , and higher levels of urinary albumin > 1.0 g/day ( 36 % vs. 10 %). In multivariable-adjusted analysis , individuals with hematuria<symptom> had a greater risk for all outcomes during the first 2 years of follow-up: Halving of eGFR or ESRD ( HR Year 1: 1.68 , Year 2: 1.36) , ESRD ( Year 1: 1.71 , Year 2: 1.39) and death ( Year 1:1.92 , Year 2: 1.77) , and these associations were attenuated , thereafter. Based on NRIs and C-statistics , no clear improvement in the ability to improve prediction of study outcomes was observed when hematuria<symptom> was included in multivariable models. In a large adult cohort with CKD , hematuria<symptom> was associated with a significantly higher risk of CKD progression and death in the first 2 years of follow-up but did not improve risk prediction.
