 Current clinical diagnostic procedures have shortcomings in the differentiation of Staphylococcus<pathogen> argenteus from Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>. This article presents three cases of Staphylococcus<pathogen> argenteus obtained from clinical samples. The initial results from biochemical and molecular methods led to an incorrect identification of the isolates as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>. Whole genome sequencing and real-time PCR targeting the nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene led to their correct identification as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> argenteus. The study shows that real-time PCR can be used to differentiate the two species in routine diagnostics. For purposes of identification based on whole genome sequencing , the MinION portable sequencer is a simple and affordable approach which could be used by many laboratories.
