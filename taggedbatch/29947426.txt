 Ectopic ( or tertiary) lymphoid structures ( ELS) are organized aggregates of lymphocytes resembling secondary lymphoid organs and developing in chronically inflamed nonlymphoid tissues during persistent infections , graft rejection , autoimmune conditions , and cancer. In this review , we will first depict the mechanisms regulating ELS generation , focusing on the role played by lymphoid chemokines. We will then characterize ELS forming in target organs during autoimmune conditions , here exemplified by rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> , and cancer , highlighting the relevance of the tissue-specific factors. Finally , we will discuss the clinical significance of ELS and the therapeutic potential of their inhibition and/or enhancement depending on the disease considered.
