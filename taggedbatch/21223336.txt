 Salinity is one of the major obstacles in the agriculture industry causing huge losses in productivity. Several strategies such as plant growth regulators with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> ( AMF) have been used to decrease the negative effects of salt stress. In our experiment , 28-homobrassinolide ( HBL) with spraying intervals was combined with AMF (
