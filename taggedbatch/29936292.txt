 I study the effect of the 1973 expansions of Medicare coverage among individuals with end-stage renal disease ( ESRD) on insurance coverage , health care utilization , and mortality. I find that the expansions increased insurance coverage by between 22 and 30 percentage points , in models that include trends in age , with the increase explained by Medicare coverage , and increased physician visits by 25-35 percent. These expansions also decreased mortality due to kidney disease in the under 65 population by between 0.5 and 1.0 deaths per 100,000. Lastly , I provide evidence for two mechanisms that affected mortality: an increase in access to and use of treatment , which may be due to changes in insurance coverage; and an increase in entry of dialysis clinics and transplant programs.
