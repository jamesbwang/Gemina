 Immunoglobulin has been widely used in a variety of diseases , including primary and secondary immunodeficiency<disease> diseases<disease> , neuromuscular diseases , and Kawasaki disease. Although a large number of clinical trials have demonstrated that immunoglobulin is effective and well tolerated , various adverse effects have been reported. The majority of these events , such as flushing , headache<symptom> , malaise<symptom> , fever<symptom> , chills<symptom> , fatigue<symptom> and lethargy<symptom> , are transient and mild. However , some rare side effects , including renal impairment , thrombosis , arrhythmia , aseptic meningitis<disease><symptom> , hemolytic<symptom> anemia<symptom> , and transfusion-related acute lung injury ( TRALI) , are serious. These adverse effects are associated with specific immunoglobulin preparations and individual differences. Performing an early assessment of risk factors , infusing at a slow rate , premedicating , and switching from intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG) to subcutaneous immunoglobulin ( SCIG) can minimize these adverse effects. Adverse effects are rarely disabling or fatal , treatment mainly involves supportive measures , and the majority of affected patients have a good prognosis.
