 Baccalaureate-prepared nurses should be competent in accessing , evaluating , and implementing research evidence into nursing practice. The purpose of this study was to gain insight into nurses ' experiences in accessing , evaluating , and implementing research into practice. Researchers conducted a qualitative descriptive study. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and field notes. Thirteen nurses participated in individual interviews. Themes that emerged included awareness , motivation-empowering change , and barriers to evidence-based practice implementation ( EBP). Several experienced nurses expressed the importance of EBP in practice but could not provide clear definitions of EBP. Personal and organizational barriers negatively influence EBP implementation in clinical practice. Nurses could be motivated to use EBP if it were translated in an easy way to understand. The information derived from this study can be used to design learning opportunities that prepare practicing nurses to appropriately appraise research and integrate evidence into practice.
