 Telomere dysfunction drives chromosome instability through endless breakage-fusion-bridge ( BFB) cycles that promote the formation of highly rearranged genomes. However , reactivation of telomerase or ALT-pathway is required for genome stabilisation and full malignant transformation. To allow the unrestricted proliferation of cells at risk of transformation , we have established a conditional system of telomere deprotection in p16
