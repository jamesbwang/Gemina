 Metabolism and gene expression , which are two fundamental biological processes that are essential to all living organisms , reciprocally regulate each other to maintain homeostasis and regulate cell growth , survival and differentiation. Metabolism feeds into the regulation of gene expression via metabolic enzymes and metabolites , which can modulate chromatin directly or indirectly- through regulation of the activity of chromatin trans-acting proteins , including histone-modifying enzymes , chromatin-remodelling complexes and transcription regulators. Deregulation of these metabolic activities has been implicated in human<disease> diseases<disease> , prominently including cancer.
