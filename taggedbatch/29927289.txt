 The current study examines associations between marital conflict and negative parenting behaviors among fathers and mothers , and the extent to which internal working models ( IWMs) of attachment relationships may serve as sources of risk or resilience during family interactions. The sample consisted of 115 families ( mothers , fathers , and their 6-month-old infants) who participated in a controlled experiment. Couples were randomly assigned to engage in either a conflict or positive marital discussion , followed by parent-infant freeplay sessions and assessment of parental IWMs of attachment ( i.e. , secure base script knowledge). While no differences in parenting behaviors emerged between the conflict and positive groups , findings revealed that couple withdrawal during the marital discussion was related to more intrusive and emotionally disengaged parenting for mothers and fathers. Interestingly , secure base script knowledge was inversely related to intrusion and emotional disengagement for fathers , but not for mothers. Furthermore , only among fathers did secure base script knowledge serve to significantly buffer the impact of marital disengagement on negative parenting ( emotional disengagement). Findings are discussed using a family systems framework and expand our understanding of families , and family members , at risk. ( PsycINFO Database Record
