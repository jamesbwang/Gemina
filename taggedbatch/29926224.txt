 Auxin response factors ( ARFs) are one type of essential family of transcription factors that bind with auxin response elements ( AuxRE) , and play vital roles in variety of plant development and physiological processes. Brachypodium distachyon , related to the major cereal grain species , were recently developed to be a good model organism for functional genomics research. So far , genome-wide overview of the ARF gene family in B. distachyon was not available. Here , a systemic analysis of ARF gene family members in B. distachyon was performed. A comprehensive overview of the characterization of the BdARFs was obtained by multiple bioinformatics analyses , including the gene and protein structure , chromosome locations , conserved motifs of proteins , phylogenetic analysis , and cis-elements in promoters of BdARF. Results showed that all BdARFs contained conserved DBD , MR , and CTD could be divided into four classes , Ia , IIa , IIb , and III. Expression profiles of BdARF genes indicated that they were expressed across various tissues and organs , which could be clustered into three main expression groups , and most of BdARF genes were involved in phytohormone signal transduction pathways and regulated physiological process in responding to multiple environmental stresses. And predicted regulatory network between B. distachyon ARFs and IAAs was also discussed. Our genomics analysis of BdARFs could yield new insights into the complexity of the control of BdARF genes and lead to potential applications in the investigation of the accurate regulatory mechanisms of ARFs in herbaceous plants.
