 Obtaining adequate social support presents a challenge for many in addiction recovery. Increasingly , individuals in recovery use online forums to exchange support with peers , yet it is unclear which help-seeking strategies most effectively recruit peer support , and which forms of support are most valued by recipients. This study applied quantitative content analysis to examine social support solicitation and delivery in an online forum for alcohol use disorder ( AUD). We compared the frequency with which peers provided informational , emotional , and companionship support after solicitations that: ( 1) were direct or indirect , ( 2) disclosed positive or negative emotions , and ( 3) mentioned or did not mention recovery problems. We assessed likelihood that recipients would express gratitude after receiving each type of support , and assessed whether the `` match '' between solicitation and disclosure styles influenced rates of gratitude expression. Emotional disclosures , whether positive or negative , received the highest volume of supportive replies. Emotional support was the most common response to solicitations overall , and was disproportionately offered after recipients disclosed positive emotions. Informational support was disproportionately offered after recipients disclosed negative emotions or recovery problems , or explicitly requested help. Regardless of their solicitation style , recipients expressed more gratitude after receiving emotional support than other support types. Providing emotional support was common in an online AUD forum , and precipitated expressing gratitude from recipients to support providers. The results may be helpful in guiding participants to more effectively obtain and provide recovery support in online forums.
