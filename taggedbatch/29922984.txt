 The 22q11 .2 deletion syndrome<disease><symptom> ( 22q11 .2 DS) is a known risk factor for development of schizophrenia and is characterized by a complex neuropsychological profile. To date , a quantitative meta-analysis examining cognitive functioning in 22q11 .2 DS has not been conducted. A systematic review of cross-sectional studies comparing neuropsychological performance of individuals with 22q11 .2 DS with age-matched healthy typically developing and sibling comparison subjects was carried out. Potential moderators were analyzed. Analyses included 43 articles ( 282 effects) that met inclusion criteria. Very large and heterogeneous effects were seen for global cognition ( d =- 1.21) and in specific neuropsychological domains ( intellectual functioning , achievement , and executive function; d range =- 0.51 to- 2.43). Moderator analysis revealed a significant role for type of healthy comparison group used ( typically developing or siblings) , demographics ( age , sex) and clinical factors ( externalizing behavior). Results revealed significant differences between pediatric and adult samples , with isolated analysis within the pediatric sample yielding large effects in several neuropsychological domains ( intellectual functioning , achievement , visual memory; d range =- 0.56 to- 2.50). Large cognitive deficits in intellectual functioning and specific neuropsychological variables in individuals with 22q11 .2 DS represent a robust finding , but these deficits are influenced by several factors , including type of comparison group utilized , age , sex , and clinical status. These findings highlight the clinical relevance of characterizing cognitive functioning in 22q11 .2 DS and the importance of considering demographic and clinical moderators in future analyses.
