 Autophagy is an essential process of cellular waist clearance that becomes altered following spinal<disease> cord injury ( SCI). Details on these changes , including timing after injury , underlying mechanisms , and affected cells , remain controversial. Here we present a characterization of autophagy in the mice spinal<disease> cord before and after a contusive SCI. In the undamaged spinal<disease> cord , analysis of LC3 and Beclin 1 autophagic markers reveals important differences in basal autophagy between neurons , oligodendrocytes , and astrocytes and even within cell populations. Following moderate contusion , western blot analyses of LC3 indicates that autophagy increases to a maximum at 7 days post injury ( dpi) , whereas unaltered Beclin 1 expression and increase of p62 suggests a possible blockage of autophagosome clearance. Immunofluorescence analyses of LC3 and Beclin 1 provide additional details that reveal a complex , cell-specific scenario. Autophagy is first activated ( 1 dpi) in the severed axons , followed by a later ( 7 dpi) accumulation of phagophores and/or autophagosomes in the neuronal soma without signs of increased initiation. Oligodendrocytes and reactive astrocytes also accumulate phagophores and autophagosomes at 7 dpi , but whereas the accumulation in astrocytes is associated with an increased autophagy initiation , it seems to result from a blockage of the autophagic flux in oligodendrocytes. Comparison with previous studies highlights the complex and heterogeneous autophagic responses induced by the SCI , leading in many cases to contradictory results and interpretations. Future studies should consider this complexity in the design of therapeutic interventions based on the modulation of autophagy to treat SCI.
