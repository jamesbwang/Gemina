 The developing pituitary is a rapidly changing environment that is constantly meeting the physiological demands of the growing organism. During early postnatal development , the anterior pituitary is refining patterns of anterior hormone secretion in response to numerous genetic factors. Our lab previously developed a somatotrope leptin receptor ( LEPR) deletion mouse model that had decreased lean body mass , disrupted metabolism , decreased GH stores and was GH deficient as an adult<disease>. To understand how deletion of LEPR in somatotropes altered GH , we turned our attention to postnatal development. The current study examines GH , PRL , TSH , ACTH , LH , and FSH secretion during postnatal days 4,5,8,10 , and 15 and compares age and sex differences. The LEPR mutants have dysregulation of GH ( p < 0.03) and a reduced developmental prolactin peak in males ( p < 0.04) and females ( p < 0.002). There were no differences in weight between groups , and the postnatal leptin surge appeared to be normal. Percentages of immunolabeled GH cells were reduced in mutants compared with controls in all age groups by 35-61 % in males and 41-44 % in females. In addition , we measured pituitary expression of pituitary transcription factors , Pou1f1 and PROP1. Pou1f1 was reduced in mutant females at PND 10 ( p < 0.009) and PND 15 ( p < 0.02) but increased in males at PND 10 ( p < 0.01). PROP1 was unchanged in female mutants but showed developmental increases at PND 5 ( p < 0.02) and PND 15 ( p < 0.01). These studies show that the dysfunction caused by LEPR deletion in somatotropes begins as early as neonatal development and involves developing GH and prolactin cells ( somatolactotropes).
