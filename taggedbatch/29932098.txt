 Rice feeds 50 % of the world & rsquo; s population. Flooding is the most common irrigation system used for growing rice , a practice responsible for a large amount of water loss. Climate changes may affect water availability in irrigated agriculture , and it will be necessary to develop more sustainable irrigation practices. The aim of this work was to determine , in controlled conditions , the threshold when water potential begins to decrease plant growth. Two independent greenhouse experiments were conducted during middle summer and fall , in order to validate the results for high and low evapotranspiration conditions. Rice plants were grown in hydroponics and the water potential was adjusted with polyethylene glycol 6000 , varying from & minus; 0.04 MPa ( control) to & minus; 0.19 MPa. Leaf water potential , water use efficiency , leaf area , and root and shoot biomass were evaluated. All assayed parameters decreased as the water potential was decreased. The water potential threshold which starts to negatively affect rice growth was between & minus; 0.046 and & minus; 0.056 MPa , which are values close to those observed in the field in previous research. The definition of a critical value may help to improve water management in rice cultivation and to maintain productivity.
