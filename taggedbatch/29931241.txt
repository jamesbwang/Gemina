 Mitochondrial genomes of animals have long been considered to evolve under the action of purifying selection. Nevertheless , there is increasing evidence that they can also undergo episodes of positive selection in response to shifts in physiological or environmental demands. Vampire bats experienced such a shift , as they are the only mammals feeding exclusively on blood and possessing anatomical adaptations to deal with the associated physiological requirements ( e.g. ingestion of high amounts of liquid water and iron). We sequenced eight new chiropteran mitogenomes including two species of vampire bats , five representatives of other lineages of phyllostomids and one close outgroup. Conducting detailed comparative mitogenomic analyses , we found evidence for accelerated evolutionary rates at the nucleotide and amino acid levels in vampires. Moreover , the mitogenomes of vampire bats are characterized by an increased cytosine ( C) content mirrored by a decrease in thymine ( T) compared to other chiropterans. Proteins encoded by the vampire bat mitogenomes also exhibit a significant increase in threonine ( Thr) and slight reductions in frequency of the hydrophobic residues isoleucine ( Ile) , valine ( Val) , methionine ( Met) , and phenylalanine ( Phe). We show that these peculiar substitution patterns can be explained by the co-occurrence of both neutral ( mutational bias) and adaptive ( positive selection) processes. We propose that vampire bat mitogenomes may have been impacted by selection on mitochondrial proteins to accommodate the metabolism and nutritional qualities of blood meals.
