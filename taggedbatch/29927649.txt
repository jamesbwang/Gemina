 To assess the influence of hearing loss on child behavioral diagnoses , and socioemotional and behavior status. We analyzed US National Health Interview Survey ( NHIS) child data , years 2011 to 2015 , for associations between reported hearing loss and relevant NHIS items. Compared with hearing children , NHIS respondents with a deaf child were more likely to report developmental delays ( adjusted odds ratio ( AOR) = 11.1; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 3.8 , 32.4) , attention-deficit disorder ( AOR = 3.1; 95 % CI = 2.5 , 3.9) , autism diagnoses ( AOR = 2.9; 95 % CI = 1.8 , 4.9) , and minor to severe socioemotional difficulties ( AOR = 3.9; 95 % CI = 3.2 , 4.7). When asked if their child was well behaved , respondents were more likely to reply `` somewhat true '' or `` not true '' ( AOR = 2.7; 95 % CI = 2.2 , 3.4). Hearing loss increases likelihood of reporting child behavioral diagnoses , behavior issues , and socioemotional difficulties. Although etiology and professional misdiagnoses likely contribute to elevated prevalence , lack of attention toward language deprivation as a public health issue prevents any further epidemiological insights. Public Health Implications. Despite widespread use of cochlear implants , concerns about deaf children 's well-being remain significant. Language deprivation requires investigation and awareness as a social determinant of health.
