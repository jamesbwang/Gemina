 The zinc finger transcription factor Crz1 is an important downstream regulator of calcium-dependent signal transduction pathways in many organisms. The function of Crz1 in the wheat-head blight pathogen Fusarium<pathogen> graminearum remains unclear. In this study , we identified and functionally characterised FgCrz1A , a potential ortholog of yeast Crz1. The deletion mutant ΔFgCrz1A exhibited slower hyphal growth on basic medium , and conidia formation and sexual reproduction were completely blocked. ΔFgCrz1A also displayed increased sensitivity to metal cations Ca
