 Objective To review clinical and pre-clinical evidence supporting the role of visual pathways , from the eye to the cortex , in the development of photophobia<symptom> in headache<symptom> disorders. Background Photophobia<symptom> is a poorly understood light-induced phenomenon that emerges in a variety of neurological and ophthalmological conditions. Over the years , multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain its causes; however , scarce research and lack of systematic assessment of photophobia<symptom> in patients has made the search for answers quite challenging. In the field of headaches<symptom> , significant progress has been made recently on how specific visual networks contribute to photophobia<symptom> features such as light-induced intensification of headache<symptom> , increased perception of brightness and visual discomfort , which are frequently experienced by migraineurs. Such progress improved our understanding of the phenomenon and points to abnormal processing of light by both cone/rod-mediated image-forming and melanopsin-mediated non-image-forming visual pathways , and the consequential transfer of photic signals to multiple brain regions involved in sensory , autonomic and emotional regulation. Conclusion Photophobia<symptom> phenotype is diverse , and the relative contribution of visual , trigeminal and autonomic systems may depend on the disease it emerges from. In migraine , photophobia<symptom> could result from photic activation of retina-driven pathways involved in the regulation of homeostasis , making its association with headache<symptom> more complex than previously thought.
