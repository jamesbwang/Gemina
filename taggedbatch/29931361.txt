 Protein methylation is a very diverse , widespread and important post-translational modification affecting all aspects of cellular biology in eukaryotes. Methylation on the side chain of lysine residues in histones has received considerable attention due to its major role in chromatin structure and the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Since the turn of the 21st century , lysine methylation of non-histone proteins emerged as a very common modification contributing to the fine-tuned regulation of protein function. In plants , our knowledge in this field is much more fragmentary than in yeast and animal cells. In this review , we describe the plant enzymes involved in the methylation of non-histone substrates. Also , we review historical and recent advances in the identification of non-histone lysine-methylated proteins in photosynthetic organisms. Last , we discuss the current knowledge and future challenges about the role of protein lysine methylation in regulating molecular and cellular functions in plants.
