 Congenital hydronephrosis caused by ureteral anomalies , like ureteral duplicity , megaureter , ureteral ectopy and ureterocele , must be differentiated from ureteropelvic junction obstruction ( UJO) hydronephrosis and from the hydronephrosis caused by vesicoureteral reflux. These represent a differentiated branch of congenital abnormalities in children even if not so common , but this fact should not be disconsidered. Over a five years period , from 111 operated children in our Clinic , we performed 13 interventions for congenital hydronephrosis , 11 ( 84.61 %) being caused by ureteral abnormalities. Here , there were described particular cases , with diagnosis steps and treatment decisions. Ureteral ectopy can be manifested by loss of urine drops in cases where ureteral holes are located in the vagina , septum or urethra , inferior to the sphincter mechanism. Incontinence in boys never occurs because the ectopic ureter never opens under the sphincter mechanism. If the ureter opens in the genital<disease> tract , patients may clinically present with the epididymitis<symptom> symptom. From autopsy statistics in the US , the incidence of ureteral duplex is estimated to be less than 1 %. When the duplex is associated with urinary<disease> infection<disease> , the incidence of ureteral duplex increases up to 8 %.
