 Purpose To describe screening outcomes from BreastScreen Norway stratified by volumetric breast density ( VBD). Materials and Methods This retrospective study included data from 107 949 women aged 50-69 years ( mean age ± standard deviation , 58.7 years ± 5.6) who underwent 307 015 screening examinations from 2007 to 2015. Automated software classified mammographic density as nondense ( VBD < 7.5 %) or dense ( VBD ≥ 7.5 %). Rates and distributions of screening outcomes ( recall , biopsy , screen-detected and interval breast cancer , positive predictive values of recall and of needle biopsy , sensitivity , specificity , and histopathologic tumor characteristics) were analyzed and stratified by density. Tests of proportions , including propensity score and t tests , were used. Results In 28 % ( 87 021 of 307 015) of the screening examinations , the breasts<disease> were classified as dense. Recall rates for women with nondense versus dense breasts<disease> were 2.7 % ( 5882 of 219 994) and 3.6 % ( 3101 of 87 021); biopsy rates were 1.1 % ( 2359 of 219 994) and 1.4 % ( 1209 of 87 021); rates of screen-detected cancer were 5.5 ( 1210 of 219 994) and 6.7 ( 581 of 87 021) per 1000 examinations; and rates of interval breast cancer were 1.2 ( 199 of 165 324) and 2.8 ( 185 of 66 674) per 1000 examinations , respectively ( P < .001 for all). Sensitivity was 82 % ( 884 of 1083) for nondense breasts<disease> and 71 % ( 449 of 634) for dense breasts<disease> , whereas specificity was 98 % ( 160 973 of 164 440) and 97 % ( 64 250 of 66 225) , respectively ( P < .001 for both). For screen-detected cancers , mean tumor diameter was 15.1 mm and 16.6 mm ( P = .01) , and lymph node-positive disease was found in 18 % ( 170 of 936) and 24 % ( 98 of 417) ( P = .02) of women with nondense and dense breasts<disease> , respectively. Conclusion Screening examinations of women with dense breasts<disease> classified by using automated software resulted in higher recall rate , lower sensitivity , larger tumor diameter , and more lymph node-positive disease compared with women with nondense breasts<disease>.
