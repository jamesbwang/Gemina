 There are 400 thousand patients with long-term hemodialysis in China nowadays. Hemodialysis , as the most common alternative to renal replacement therapy , prolongs the life span of patients with end stage renal<symptom> failure<symptom>. However , there are still many complications of hemodialysis treatment. These complications reduce the quality of life of patients and may even endanger their life , and sometimes they are difficult to deal with. Classical prescriptions , commonly referred to as classical effective prescriptions in modern medicine , mainly indicating the formulas recorded in Treatise on Febrile Diseases and Synopsis of Golden Chamber , were relative to contemporary prescriptions emerging after Song and Yuan dynasties. Prescriptions corresponding to syndromes<disease><symptom> means one-to-one correspondence between syndromes<disease><symptom> and prescriptions , with many advantages and that is the key of clinical efficacy. Many complications of hemodialysis patients have typical clinical manifestations , which can match the syndromes<disease><symptom> corresponding to classical prescriptions , thus quickly relieving the symptoms of patients in clinical application. Six clinical cases of dialysis muscle spasm , disequilibrium syndrome<disease><symptom> , restless legs syndrome<disease><symptom> , uremic encephalopathy , post dialysis arrhythmia , and secondary hyperparathyroidism were used in this paper , to explore the intervention strategies for hemodialysis related complications.
