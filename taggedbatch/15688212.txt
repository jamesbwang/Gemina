 Nutrient cycling is greatly influenced by dominant plants that contribute high amounts of leaf litter to soils; however , less-dominant and rare species can play keystone roles in nutrient cycling if they have unique nutrient acquisition traits and provide high-quality litter. In many parts of the world , wildfire is likely to become more frequent and intense under a changing climate. The effect this will have on plant rarity and on species with unique nutrient acquisition traits , and thus nutrient cycling , remains poorly understood. Working within an Australian box-ironbark forest<disease> , we determined if a relationship existed between species rarity and the uniqueness of their leaf nutrient profiles , and if this relationship changed after prescribed burning. We created an index of species rarity from a data set of woody perennial species abundance in areas before and after autumn or spring burns , or left unburnt. We created indices of uniqueness for the leaf nutrient profiles of 42 woody perennial species occurring in the ecosystem , based on amounts of six macronutrients and four micronutrients found in fresh and senesced leaves of each species. Five nutrient acquisition strategies ( mycorrhizal , N-fixing , carnivorous , hemiparasitic and proteoid roots) were represented in the data set. There was no community-wide relationship between rarity and uniqueness of leaf nutrient profiles , and this did not change as a result of fire. However , two hemiparasitic species were relatively rare in the ecosystem studied , and differed greatly from other species due to high K and P in senesced leaves. Thus , some of the rarest species , such as hemiparasites , can be functionally unique. Understanding the functional characteristics of rare species is important so that unique functional contributors can be identified and conserved to prevent local extinction.
