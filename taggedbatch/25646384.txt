 Integrin subunit alpha 9 ( ITGA9) mediates cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion , cell migration , and invasion through binding different kinds of extracellular matrix ( ECM) components. However , its potential role and underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC). Here , we found that ITGA9 expression was obviously decreased in patients with HCC , which was negatively correlated with HCC growth and metastasis. ITGA9 overexpression significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration
