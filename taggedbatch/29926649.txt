 To investigate the effects of simulated 100 m Trimix conventional diving on tissue inflammatory cytokines in rabbits. Eight New Zealand rabbits were performed a simulated 100 m Trimix conventional diving program which was established according to the Haldane theory. The expression levels of interferon-gamma ( IFN- The expressions of IFN- The simulated 100 m Trimix conventional diving had significant impact on oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction in rabbits , the results of wet/dry ratio showed that the diving rabbits had no tissue edema<symptom> after decompression.
