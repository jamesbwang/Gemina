 Oral cancer is a cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide and the treatment of oral cancer includes radiation , surgery and chemotherapy. Quercetin is a component from natural plant products and it has been demonstrated that quercetin is able to induce cytotoxic effects through induction of cell apoptosis in a number of human cancer cell lines. However , there is no available information to demonstrate that quercetin is able to induce apoptosis in human oral cancer cells. In the present study , the effect of quercetin on the cell death via the induction of apoptosis in human oral cancer SAS cells was investigated using flow cytometry , Annexin V/propidium iodide ( PI) double staining , western blotting and confocal laser microscopy examination , to test for cytotoxic effects at 6-48 h after treatment with quercetin. The rate of cell death increased with the duration of quercetin treatment based on the results of a cell viability assay , increased Annexin V/PI staining , increased reactive oxygen species and Ca
