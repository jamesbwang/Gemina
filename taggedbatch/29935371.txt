 The concept of self-care in the elderly has been frequently associated with autonomy , independence and personal accountability. Self-care practices are a result of individual lifestyles and paths adapted to the circumstances and expectations of the elderly. Based on the model by Backman and Hentinen ( 1999) , the present study attempts to categorically describe the types of self-care of the elderly. This is an exploratory study , transversal , of a quantitative nature. The sample was comprised of 313 participants , randomly selected among Elderly Care Centres in the interior North of Portugal. The Portuguese version of Self-care of Home Dwelling Elderly was used for data collection. The results call for a replication of the study , using the theoretical derivation of the four self-care profiles ( responsible , formally guided , independent and abandoned).
