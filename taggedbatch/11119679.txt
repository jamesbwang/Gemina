 Treatment for musculoskeletal fibromatosis remains challenging. Surgical excision for fibromatosis is the standard therapy but recurrence remains high. Corticosteroids , an anti-fibrogenic compound , have been used to treat early stage palmar fibromatosis , but the mechanism is unknown. We investigated the inhibitory mechanism effect of corticosteroids in the murine model of fibromatosis nodule as well as in cultured FSCs. Quantitative reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) analysis and immunofluorescence ( IF) staining for markers of myofibroblasts ( α-smooth muscle actin and type III collagen) were used to examine the effect of dexamethasone on myofibroblasic differentiation of FSCs both in vitro and in vivo. Transforming growth factor-β1 ( TGF-β1) signaling and its downstream targets were examined using western blot analysis. TGF-β1 expression in FSCs before and after dexamethasone treatment was compared. In addition , inhibition of TGF-β1 expression was examined using RNA interference ( RNAi) on FSCs , both in vitro and in vivo. Treating FSCs with dexamethasone inhibited FSCs ' myofibroblastic differentiation in vitro. Treating FSCs with dexamethasone before or after implantation further inhibited formation of fibromatosis nodules<symptom>. Dexamethasone suppressed expression of TGF-β1 and pSmad2/3 by FSCs in vitro. TGF-β1 knockdown FSCs showed reducing myofibroblastic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Finally , addition of TGF-β1 abolished dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of myofibroblastic differentiation. Dexamethasone inhibits the myofibroblastic differentiated potential of FSCs both in vitro and in vivo through inhibition of TGF-β1 expression in FSCs. TGF-β1 plays a key role in myofibroblastic differentiation.
