 The role of illicit drug abuse in total joint arthroplasty is largely unknown and is likely underestimated. Patients with drug addictions often suffer from septic osteoarthritis or a necrosis<symptom> of the femoral head. Purpose of the study was to evaluate the operative management and clinical outcome of total hip replacement in patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse. This retrospective study included 15 patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse who underwent total hip arthroplasty. A total of 6 females and 9 males with an average age of 34.3 years were identified. Ten patients presented an acute bacterial coxitis ( Coxitis-group) and five an aseptic osteonecrosis of the femoral head ( Osteonecrosis-group). Ten patients with a bacterial coxitis underwent a two-staged total hip arthroplasty ( THA) , with temporary insertion of a drug-eluting spacer. Five patients with a necrosis<symptom> of the femoral head were primarily treated with THA. All patients developed multiple re-infections after insertion of a drug-eluting spacer or THA. Only two patients finally achieved a THA without infection in the period of 3.9 years follow-up. The other 13 patients underwent a Girdlestone arthroplasty ( 7 patients) or total joint replacement with a chronic fistula<disease> ( 6 patients). THA in patients with illicit drug abuse shows a low success rate. Following septic osteoarthritis or osteonecrosis in drug-addicted patients , we recommend a two-stage procedure with temporary insertion of a drug-eluting spacer. THA might follow only under strict premises.
