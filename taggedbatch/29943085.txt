 The health effects of individual criteria air pollutants have been well investigated. However , little is known about the health effects of air pollutant mixtures that more realistically represent environmental exposures. The present study was designed to evaluate the cardiac effects of inhaled simulated smog atmospheres ( SA) generated from the photochemistry of either gasoline and isoprene ( SA-G) or isoprene ( SA-Is) in mice. Four-month-old female mice were exposed for 4 h to filtered air ( FA) , SA-G , or SA-Is. Immediately and 20 h after exposure , cardiac responses were assessed with a Langendorff preparation using a protocol consisting of 20 min of global ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion. Cardiac function was measured by index of left-ventricular developed pressure ( LVDP) and cardiac contractility ( dP/dt) before ischemia. Pre-ischemic LVDP was lower in mice immediately after SA-Is exposure ( 52.2 Â± 5.7 cm H
