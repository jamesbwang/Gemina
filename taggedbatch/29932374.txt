 OBJECTIVE The optimal treatment strategy for patients with emergent large vessel occlusion ( ELVO) due to underlying severe intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis ( ICAS) is unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare treatment outcomes from intracranial angioplasty with or without stenting and intraarterial infusion of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor in patients with ELVO due to severe ICAS , and to investigate predictors of outcome after endovascular therapy in such patients. METHODS A total of 140 consecutive patients with ELVO attributable to severe ICAS underwent endovascular therapy at two stroke centers ( A and B). Intracranial angioplasty/stenting was primarily performed at center A and intraarterial infusion of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor ( tirofiban) at center B. Data from both centers were prospectively collected into a database and retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS Overall , successful reperfusion was achieved in 95 % ( 133/140) of patients and a good outcome in 60 % ( 84/140). The mortality rate was 7.9 %. Symptomatic hemorrhage<symptom> occurred in 1 patient. There were no significant differences in the rates of successful reperfusion , symptomatic hemorrhage<symptom> , 3-month modified Rankin scale score 0-2 , and mortality between the two centers. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed the only independent predictor of good outcome was a history of previous stroke or transient ischemic attack ( TIA) ( odds ratio 0.254 , 95 % confidence interval 0.094-0.689 , p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS Both intracranial angioplasty/stenting and intraarterial infusion of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor are effective and safe in the treatment of underlying severe ICAS in acute stroke patients with ELVO. In addition , a lack of a history of stroke/TIA was the only independent predictor of good outcome after endovascular therapy in such patients.
