 To evaluate renal fibrosis<disease> in immunoglobulin A nephropathy ( IgAN) using diffusion kurtosis imaging ( DKI). Twenty patients with biopsy-proven IgAN were enrolled. DKI was performed on a clinical 3 T magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) system , and region-of-interest measurements were conducted to determine mean kurtosis ( K) , mean diffusivity ( D) , and apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) of the kidney cortex. Renal biopsy specimens were scored based on the severity of renal fibrosis<disease>. The associations between the DKI data and clinicopathological parameters were investigated. Both the K and ADC were not only well correlated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate , but also significantly associated with the pathological scores of fibrosis<disease> , including the glomerular sclerosis index ( K: r = 0.759 , p < 0.001; ADC: r = -0.636 , p = 0.003) and the percentage of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis<disease> ( K: r = 0.767 , p < 0.001; ADC: r = -0.702 , p = 0.001). Further receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that K demonstrated better diagnostic performance in discriminating severe glomerulosclerosis ( area under curve ( AUC) 0.970 , sensitivity 81.8 % , specificity 100 %) , and ADC displayed better capabilities in identifying severe tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis<disease> ( AUC 0.976 , sensitivity 100 % , specificity 92.9 %). This DKI method can be used to detect renal fibrosis<disease> in IgAN in a non-invasive manner and may provide additional information for characterisation and surveillance.
