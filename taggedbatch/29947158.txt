 Chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD) is an X-linked ( XL) or autosomal recessive ( AR) primary immunodeficiency<disease> disease<disease>. Respiratory burst assessment by flow cytometry is a rapid test of granulocyte stimulation , and results predict the underlying genotype. This study aims to describe the immune-phenotypic profile of patients with CGD diagnosed in our center and correlate that with underlying genetic mutations. Immuno-phenotypic and genetic data on all patients with CGD diagnosed at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital ( SQUH) were reviewed. A total of 32 patients were diagnosed with CGD using molecular studies. Genetically confirmed individuals included 1 patient with XL-CGD ( a large deletion involving the CYBB and XK genes resulting in a McLeod phenotype) , 27 patients with AR-CGD with a c. 579G > A ( p.Trp193X) mutation at the NCF1 gene , and 4 patients with AR-CGD with a c. 784G > A ( p.Gly262Ser) mutation at the NCF1 gene. Flow cytometry and molecular results were available for comparison in 26 patients with AR-CGD. The patients with AR-CGD had a range of flow cytometry-generated fluorescent patterns as follows: reduced neutrophil stimulation with a sharp peak ( 12/26) , reduced neutrophil stimulation with a broad peak ( 11/26) , and a complete lack of neutrophil stimulation ( 3/26). No consistent flow cytometry-generated fluorescent pattern was observed in either of the 2 AR mutations identified in our patients. Flow cytometry is a robust test of CGD diagnosis. However , results should be interpreted with caution when predicting the underlying probable genotype , and results need to be complemented with definitive molecular studies.
