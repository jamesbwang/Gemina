 The aim of this study is to detect plasma ST2 levels in patients who were admitted to emergency department with chest<symptom> pain<symptom> and diagnosed with non st segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI) and to research the relationship between 28-day mortality and ST2 levels. The present study was conducted at Emergency Department of Celal Bayar University Hafsa Sultan Hospital between September 2015 and January 2016 as a prospective , single-center , cross-sectional study. Plasma ST2 levels were detected in patients who were diagnosed with NSTEMI based on physical examination , ECG and troponin. The eligible patients were followed up with regard to mortality during 28 days. A total of 88 patients diagnosed with NSTEMI were included in the study and followed up for 28 days. While 18 ( 20.5 %) patients died at the end of 28 days , 70 ( 79.5 %) patients survived. Mean ST2 level of surviving 70 patients was 651.37 ± 985.66 pg/mL and mean ST2 level of dying 18 patients was 2253.66 ± 1721.15 pg/mL ( p < 0.001). ST2 value was higher among the dying ( non-survivors) compared to the survivors at the end of 28 days and this was found related to mortality. ST2 cut-off value was found as 1000 pg/mL with 72.2 % sensitivity and 20.0 % specificity. Among the patients who were diagnosed with NSTEMI at the emergency department , ST2 levels on admission were found significantly higher among the non-survivors compared to the survivors. ST2 level was accepted as a reliable biomarker for prediction of 28 mortality in patients diagnosed with NSTEMI.
