 The formation of a primordial crust is a critical step in the evolution of terrestrial planets but the timing of this process is poorly understood. The mineral zircon is a powerful tool for constraining crust formation because it can be accurately dated with the uranium-to-lead ( U-Pb) isotopic decay system and is resistant to subsequent alteration. Moreover , given the high concentration of hafnium in zircon , the lutetium-to-hafnium (
