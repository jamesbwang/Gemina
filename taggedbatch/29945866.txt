 Many proliferative epithelia are pseudostratified because of cell cycle-dependent interkinetic nuclear migration ( IKNM , basal during G1 and apical during G2). Although most epithelia , including early embryonic neuroepithelia ( ≤ 100 µm thick) , undergo IKNM over the entire apicobasal extent , more apicobasally elongated ( 300 µm) neural progenitor cells ( radial glial cells) in the mid-embryonic mouse cerebral wall move their nuclei only within its apical ( 100 µm) compartment , leaving the remaining basal region nucleus-free ( fiber-like). How this IKNM range ( i.e. the thickness of a pseudostratified ventricular zone ( VZ)) is determined remains unknown. Here , we report external fencing of IKNM and the VZ by differentiating cells. When a tight stack of multipolar cells immediately basal to the VZ was ` drilled ' via acute neuron-directed expression of diphtheria<disease> toxin , IKNM of apicobasally connected progenitor cells continued further towards the basal region of the cell ( 200 µm). The unfencing-induced basally overshot nuclei stay in S phase for too long and do not move apically , suggesting that external limitation of IKNM is necessary for progenitors to undergo normal cytogenetic behaviors. Thus , physical collaboration between progenitors and differentiating cells , including neurons , underlies brain development.
