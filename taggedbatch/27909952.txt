 Ecological studies are increasingly considering phylogenetic relationships among species. The phylogeny is used as a proxy or filter to improve statistical tests and retain evolutionary elements , such as niche conservation. We used the phylogenetic topology to improve the model for occurrence of Trichoptera genera in Cerrado ( Brazilian Savanna) streams. We tested whether parameters generated by logistic models of occurrence , using phylogenetic signals , are better than models generated without phylogenetic information. We used a model with Bayesian updating to examine the influence of stream water pH and phylogenetic relationship among genera on the occurrence of Trichoptera genera. Then , we compared this model with the logistic model for each Trichoptera genus. The probability of occurrence of most genera increased with water pH , and the phylogeny-based explicit logistic model improved the parameters estimated for observed genera. The inferred relationship between genera occurrence and stream pH improved , indicating that phylogeny adds relevant information when estimating ecological responses of organisms. Water with elevated acidity ( low pH values) may be restrictive for the occurrence of Trichoptera larvae , especially if the regional streams exhibit neutral to alkaline water , as is observed in the Cerrado region. Using phylogeny-based modeling to predict species occurrence is a prominent opportunity to extend our current statistical framework based on environmental conditions , as it enables a more precise estimation of ecological parameters.
