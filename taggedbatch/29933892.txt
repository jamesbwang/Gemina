 Squamous cell carcinoma with pseudoangiosarcomatous features is a rare but well-recognized variant of squamous cell carcinoma. These tumors exhibit complex anastomosing channels lined by neoplastic cells , histologically mimicking a vasoformative mesenchymal tumor. Immunohistochemically , the published cases expressed epithelial markers and were consistently negative for vascular markers. Squamous cell carcinoma with pseudoangiosarcomatous features and aberrant expression of vascular markers has never been reported. Herein , we report two cases of metastatic poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with pseudoangiosarcomatous morphologic features which showed immunoreactivity for vascular markers ( CD31 , Fli-1 , and ERG). One case ( left thigh skin squamous cell carcinoma with abdominal wall metastasis) showed strong and diffuse positivity for vascular markers , and the final diagnosis was confirmed with electron microscopy. The second case ( squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary site with bone metastasis) showed patchy positivity for both squamous and vascular markers. This is the first report of squamous cell carcinoma with pseudoangiosarcomatous features and aberrant expression of vascular markers , which resembles angiosarcoma both morphologically and immunohistochemically , and may represent a potential diagnostic pitfall. It is of crucial importance for pathologists to be aware of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma with such unique features , so that misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment will be avoided.
