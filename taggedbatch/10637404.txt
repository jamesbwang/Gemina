 Cholinergic hypothesis has been advanced as an etiology of Alzheimer disease ( AD) on the basis of the presynaptic deficit found in the diseased brains , and cholinesterase inhibitors ( ChEIs) are the treatment of choice for these patients. However , only about half of treatment efficacy was found. Because increasing evidence supports an extensive interrelationship between thyroid hormones ( THs) , cortisol level and the cholinergic system , the aim of the present study was to evaluate thyroid function and cortisol level in patients with mild to moderate AD before and after ChEIs treatment , and to identify possible variations in response. This was a prospective , case-control , follow-up study. Levels of cortisol and THs were evaluated in 21 outpatients with mild to moderate AD and 20 normal controls. All patients were treated with 5 mg/day of donepezil ( DPZ) and were reevaluated after 24-26 weeks of treatment. The patients had worse cognitive function , higher cortisol level , and lower levels of triiodothyronine ( T These results suggest that relatively higher levels of T
