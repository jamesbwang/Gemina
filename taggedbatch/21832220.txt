 Primary intramedullary spinal<disease> cord lymphoma ( PISCL) is rare and constitutes only 1 % of central nervous system lymphomas. We report a case of PISCL in a 37-year-old man with advanced AIDS. To our knowledge , only 4 cases of PISCL in the setting of HIV/AIDS have been reported in the literature. Despite treatment , prognosis remains dismal.
