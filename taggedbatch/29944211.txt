 Pyruvate kinase ( PK) is a key enzyme in glycolysis and carbon metabolism. Here , we isolated a rice ( Oryza sativa) mutant , w59 , with a white-core floury endosperm. Map-based cloning of w59 identified a mutation in OsPKpα1 , which encodes a plastidic isoform of PK ( PKp). OsPKpα1 localizes to the amyloplast stroma in the developing endosperm , and the mutation of OsPKpα1 in w59 decreases the plastidic PK activity , resulting in dramatic changes to the lipid biosynthesis in seeds. The w59 grains were also characterized by a marked decrease in starch content. Consistent with a decrease in number and size of the w59 amyloplasts , large empty spaces were observed in the central region of the w59 endosperm , at the early grain-filling stage. Moreover , a phylogenetic analysis revealed four potential rice isoforms of OsPKp. We validated the in vitro PK activity of these OsPKps through reconstituting active PKp complexes derived from inactive individual OsPKps , revealing the heteromeric structure of rice PKps , which was further confirmed using a protein-protein interaction analysis. These findings suggest a functional connection between lipid and starch synthesis in rice endosperm amyloplasts.
