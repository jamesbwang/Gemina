 The combinations of oral fluoropyrimidines and cisplatin such as capecitabine and cisplatin ( XP) or S-1 and cisplatin ( SP) are regarded as a standard therapy against unresectable , recurrent , or advanced gastric cancer ( AGC). Especially , SP is the most common regimen against AGC in Japan. For patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 ( HER2)- positive AGC , trastuzumab , a monoclonal antibody targeting HER2 antibody , is additionally used in combination. Although trastuzumab in combination with XP ( trastuzumab-XP) have been widely accepted , the efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with SP ( trastuzumab-SP) lacks sufficient verification. The aim of the present study is to validate the comparability of trastuzumab-SP to trastuzumab-XP. Patients with HER2-positive AGC were assigned to the trastuzumab-XP or trastuzumab-SP group. We then retrospectively compared the efficacy and safety between both groups. As a first-line chemotherapy , trastuzumab in combination with XP or SP was administered to 58 patients: 28 with trastuzumab-XP and 30 with trastuzumab-SP. In the trastuzumab-XP group , response rate ( RR) , disease control rate ( DCR) , median progression-free survival ( mPFS) , and median overall survival ( mOS) were 39.3 % , 89.3 % , 7.9 months , and 20.0 months , respectively. In the trastuzumab-SP group , RR , DCR , mPFS and mOS were 50.0 % , 86.7 % , 6.9 months , and 16.7 months , respectively. No significant difference in efficacy was observed between both groups. Severe hand-foot syndrome<disease><symptom> was observed more frequently in the trastuzumab-XP group than in the trastuzumab-SP group ( 14.3 % vs. 0 % , p = 0.05). Trastuzumab in combination with SP is a potential first-line therapeutic option for patients with HER2-positive AGC.
