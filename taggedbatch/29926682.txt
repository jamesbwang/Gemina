 To investigate the effect of Astragalus injection on cardiomyocyte apoptosis , endoplasmic reticulum stress and connexin protein in cardiomyopathy rats induced by adriamycin. Thirty-six male Wister rats were randomly divided into control group ( Compared with control group , LVEDD , LVESD increased and LVEF decreased , myocardial fibers were disordered and edematous , infiltrated by lymphocytes , the mitochondria were destroyed and vacuolized , and the number of cardiomyocyte apoptosis was increased ( Astragalus injection may effectively improve the myocardial damage induced by adriamycin , its mechanism may be related to the inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ERS) and the decrease of phosphorylation of CX43 in cardiomyopathy rats induced by adriamycin.
