 Pneumoperitoneum is described as the presence of free air in the peritoneal cavity. In the majority of cases , it is the manifestation of abdominal viscus perforation , requiring an emergent surgical exploration. In rare cases , however , no evidence of perforation of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts can be found at exploration , and in such cases , the pneumoperitoneum is referred to as non-surgical pneumoperitoneum. We present a case of an 87-year-old man who developed a non-surgical pneumoperitoneum in the setting of gram-negative sepsis<disease>. The patient was admitted for treatment of obstructive uropathy and sepsis<disease> secondary to a gram-negative urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease>. Despite the initial resuscitation and antibiotic therapy , his hospital course was complicated by worsening abdominal<symptom> discomfort<symptom> , and a chest radiograph revealed free air under the diaphragm. He was taken to the operating room for an emergent surgical exploration that revealed no visceral perforation or other possible surgical causes. He tolerated and recovered from surgery well , and had a complete resolution of pneumoperitoneum in the early post-surgery period , per radiographic imaging. This interesting case highlights a rare case of idiopathic nonsurgical pneumoperitoneum in the setting of gram-negative sepsis<disease>. Additionally , we discuss considering non-surgical etiologies for patients without clinical signs or surgical evidence of perforation.
