 Here we report the first examples of 3d-4f compounds based on LnII cations. We have obtained a series of Ni2 ( LnCl6) isostructural compounds where LnII = Ce 1 , Eu 2 and Gd 3 which were characterized in a cubic crystalline system with a Fm3 ( combining macron) m space group. Magnetic and optical characterization was also performed on this new class of compounds.
