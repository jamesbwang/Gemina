 Mucins , the main component of the mucus secretions of goblet and epithelial cells , are known for exhibiting a different behaviour in accordance with their surrounding environment ( i.e. among others the environmental pH) , which induces a drastic change in their measured mechanical properties. In this work , we have first employed Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM) in Force Spectroscopy mode to evaluate the adhesion of porcine mucin films at the nanoscale , and the changes caused in this particular factor by a pH variation between 7.0 and 4.0 , both quite common values in biological conditions. Measurements also involved additional varying factors such as the indenting tip chemistry ( hydrophobic vs hydrophilic) , its residence time on the measured film ( 0 , 1 and/or 2 seconds) , and increasing pulling rates ( ranging from 0.1 up to 10 Âµm/s). A second approach regarded the macroscale behaviour of the films , due to their potential applicability in the development of a new set of stimuli-responsive biomaterials. This was possible by means of complementary Wilhelmy plate method ( to test the wetting properties) and cell proliferation studies on films previously exposed to the corresponding pH solution. According to our results , treatment with lowest pH ( 4.0) provides porcine mucin with a more hydrophilic character , showing a much stronger adhesion for analogous chemistries , as well as enhanced capability for cell attachment and proliferation , which opens new pathways for their future use and consideration as scaffold-forming material.
