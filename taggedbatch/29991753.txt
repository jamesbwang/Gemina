 The physical characteristics of tumours are intricately linked to the tumour phenotype and difficulties during treatment. Many factors contribute to the increased stiffness of tumours; from increased matrix deposition , matrix remodelling by forces from cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts , matrix crosslinking , increased cellularity , and the build-up of both solid and interstitial pressure. Increased stiffness then feeds back to increase tumour invasiveness and reduce therapy efficacy. Increased understanding of this interplay is offering new therapeutic avenues.
