 Coronary artery disease ( CAD) and aortic stenosis ( AS) frequently coexist. The presence of CAD has been consistently associated with an impaired prognosis in patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement during short- and long-term follow-up. Accordingly , current guidelines recommend coronary revascularisation of all significant stenoses in patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement. Conversely , the management of concomitant CAD in patients with severe AS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI) is still a matter of debate. The aim of this review article is to provide an overview on the role of coronary revascularisation in TAVI patients.
