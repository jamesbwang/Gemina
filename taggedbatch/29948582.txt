 A highly efficient , metal-free and solvent-free process is reported for the preparation of novel series of alkyl and aryl primary thiocarbamates and dithiocarbamates through the reaction of aliphatic alcohols , phenols and thiols with thiocyanate salts in the presence of 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid ( DBSA) as an inexpensive , readily available and amphipathic acid reagent. All reactions proceeded smoothly , and the products are obtained in good to excellent yields. Using this method , a wide range of structurally diverse primary thiocarbamates was prepared successfully.
