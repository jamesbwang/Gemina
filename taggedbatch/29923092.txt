 Mycophenolate , an immunosuppressant , is commonly used off-label for autoimmune neurological conditions. In CLN3 disease , a neurodegenerative disorder of childhood , preclinical and clinical data suggest secondary autoimmunity and inflammation<symptom> throughout the central nervous system are key components of pathogenesis. We tested the short-term tolerability of mycophenolate in individuals with CLN3 disease , in preparation for possible long-term efficacy trials of this drug. We conducted a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study of mycophenolate in 19 ambulatory individuals with CLN3 disease to determine the safety and tolerability of short-term administration ( NCT01399047). The study included two 8-week treatment periods with a 4-week intervening washout. Mycophenolate was well tolerated. 89.5 % of participants completed the mycophenolate arm , on the assigned study dose ( 95 % CI: 66.9-98.7 %) , and there were no significant differences in tolerability rates between mycophenolate and placebo arms ( 10.5 %; 95 % CI: -3.3-24.3 % , p = 0.21). All reported adverse events were mild in severity; the most common adverse events on mycophenolate were vomiting ( 31.6 %; 95 % CI: 12.6-56.6 %) , diarrhea<disease><symptom> ( 15.8 %; 95 % CI: 3.4-39.6 %) , and cough<symptom> ( 15.8 %; 95 % CI: 3.4-39.6 %). These did not occur at a significantly increased frequency above placebo. There were no definite effects on measured autoimmunity or clinical outcomes in the setting of short-term administration. Study of long-term exposure is needed to test the impact of mycophenolate on key clinical features and CLN3 disease trajectory.
