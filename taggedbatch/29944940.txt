 Arginase is one of the key enzymes responsible for maintaining the essential levels of nitrogen among plants , but biochemical and functional characterization of arginase among plants is limited. While screening for stable plant arginase , we found cilantro possessing an abundant and stable arginase. We purified arginase to apparent homogeneity ( 3300-fold purification) with a specific activity of 81,728 nmoles of urea formed/mg of protein/min and its eight-tryptic fragments had amino acid sequences identical to Arabidopsis thaliana arginase. Cilantro arginase exhibited absolute requirement for Mn
