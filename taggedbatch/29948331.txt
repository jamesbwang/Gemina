 It has been presumed that increased susceptibility in Mexicans to type 2 diabetes ( T2D) is attributed to the Native American genetic ancestry. Nonetheless , it is not known if there are private genetic variants that confer susceptibility to develop T2D in our population. The Maya indigenous group has the highest proportion of Native American ancestry ( 98 %) which makes it a representative group of the original peoples of Mexico. Thus , the aim of the present study is to identify new genetic variants associated with T2D in Maya families. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on DNA samples from Maya families with a third-generation family history of T2D only in one parental line. Four variants were identified for APOB , PPP1R3A , TPPP2 , and GPR1 genes , and were further tested for association with T2D in 600 unrelated Maya in a case-control study. For the first time , rs1799999 in PPP1R3A was associated with risk of T2D in Mayan Mexican individuals ( OR = 1.625 , P = 0.014). Interestingly , carriers of rs1799999 presented increased values of HOMA-IR. In addition , rs1801702 in APOB was associated with total cholesterol and LDL-C ( P = 0.019 and P = 0.020 , respectively) in normoglycemic individuals; rs3732083 in GPR1 with HOMA-IR ( P = 0.016) and rs9624 in TPPP2 with total cholesterol and triglycerides ( P = 0.002 and P = 0.005 , respectively) in T2D subjects. Overall , these findings support the idea that there are other genetic variants yet to be described , involved in T2D development in Maya population , being insulin resistance and lipid metabolism the main mechanisms implicated. Thus , these results can contribute to the understanding of diabetes genetic background in Mexican population.
