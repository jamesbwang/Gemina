 A computational study of F- ( CH3) 2XYF ( X = O , S , Se; Y = F , H) triads , with F- bound to the protons of the two methyl groups , found significant enhancement of the XY interactions relative to the neutral ( CH3) 2XYF dyads , more so for the XF than the XH interaction. A subsequent model study of anionic F- ( CH3) 2OYZ ( YZ = HF , CH3F , SiH3F , GeH3F , NF3 , OF2 , F2 , ClF) triads revealed a similar enhancement of all OY noncovalent interactions. The relative stabilities and associated properties of the OY Ïƒ-hole interactions were rationalized using the electronegativity difference between O and Y. Very strongly bound Z- ( CH3) 2X-F2 ( Z = F , Cl , Br; X = S , Se) clusters were also predicted and involve interactions between the anion Z- , Lewis base ( CH3) 2X and two F atoms sandwiching the central X atom to form a nearly linear F-X-F axis.
