 None A total of 279 stool<symptom> samples were screened using microscopy , culture ( Jones ' medium) , and polymerase chain reaction ( PCR)- based methods. Among the three , PCR is considered the gold standard test for detection of The sensitivity and specificity determined on the basis of microscopy were 36.2 % and 99.4 % , respectively. On the other hand , Jones ' medium showed 67.6 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity. Further , we documented various morphological and reproductive features of Although molecular diagnosis is a necessary tool for understanding the true epidemiology of
