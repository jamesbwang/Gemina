 β-Glucan has been shown to modulate immune system and potentially aid wound<disease><symptom> healing. A naturally-available β-glucan , paramylon , is available in the form of a film , which would be an ideal form to use in wound<disease><symptom> care. The aim of this study was to examine the therapeutic efficacy of paramylon film as a wound<disease><symptom> dressing. An acute<disease> wound<disease><symptom> was created on the skin of the posterior aspect of mice and wound<disease><symptom> healing was observed for 5 days. Mice were treated with either paramylon film or conventional cellulose film. The time course of changes in wound<disease><symptom> size revealed that paramylon film dressing application leads to significantly faster wound<disease><symptom> contraction than conventional cellulose film. The dressing suppressed elevation of the inflammatory cytokines interferon gamma , interleukin-6 , and vascular endothelial growth factor. β-Glucan paramylon film can facilitate wound<disease><symptom> healing by inhibiting inflammatory aggression and has potential application as a novel wound<disease><symptom> dressing.
