 The aim of this article was to investigate the use of laser Doppler flowmetry ( LDF) combined with a fast Fourier transformation ( FFT). LDF data in relation to three different scenarios were evaluated: ( a) LDF records of a right central upper incisor of one patient were used for FFT analysis. These records were obtained by means of 30 pre-manufactured splints , handled by dentists without any experience in LDF recording. ( b) Diurnal variations in one patient were analysed with LDF and FFT using 11 splints by one and same experienced investigator at four specific moments of the day. ( c) Pulpal status was analysed using 17 splints. Eleven for a patient , standing as case model and six splints for six other patients. In this specific group , each patient had one vital and one non-vital central maxillary incisor and was analysed separately by LDF and FFT. The data of assessment ( b) showed diurnal variations on LDF values of almost 80 % , indicating that LDF registration is best performed in the same time period of the day. Data verification with FFT confirmed the findings without FFT of assessment ( a) and ( b). In assessment , ( c) FFT demonstrated a clear distinction between a vital and a non-vital pulp for those cases with one vital tooth and one root canal treated tooth. In those cases with one vital incisor and the other traumatised , FFT was undeterminated. Considered that FFT was obtained after LDF recording and remained undeterminated for a decision in cases with decreasing pulpal blood flow in time , the added value of FFT in pulpal traumatology was minimal.
