 The corrosion products usually found on outdoor bronzes are generated by the interaction between the metal alloy and the atmospheric pollutants. To protect the external surface of bronzes , different organic materials ( natural or synthetic) can be applied , creating over time a patina consisting of a complex mixture of inorganic and organic degraded components. The correct chemical characterization of patina constituents is fundamental to define the state of conservation of a metal artwork and address proper restoration actions. In this paper , we evaluated the potentialities of near-infrared ( NIR) reflectance microscopy ( 4000-7500 cm
