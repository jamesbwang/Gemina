 We study the adhesion between differently processed glass and filled bromobutyl rubber in dry conditions , in water , and in silicone oil. The boundary line between contact and non-contact in adhesion experiments can be considered as a mode I crack , and we show that viscoelastic energy dissipation , close to the opening ( or closing) crack tip and surface roughness , strongly affects the work of adhesion. We observe strong adhesion hysteresis and , in contrast to the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts theory prediction for elastic solids , this results in a pull-off force ( and work of adhesion) which depends on the loading force and contact time. In particular , for the system immersed in water and silicone oil , we register very weak adhesive bonding. For glass ball with baked-on silicone oil , the pull-off force is nearly independent of the contact time , but this is not observed for the unprocessed glass surface.
