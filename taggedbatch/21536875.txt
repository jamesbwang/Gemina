 The Devonian period ended with one of the largest mass extinctions in the Earth history. It comprised a series of separate events , which eliminated many marine species and led to long-term post-extinction reduction in body size in some groups. Surprisingly , crinoids were largely unaffected by these extinction events in terms of diversity. To date , however , no study examined the long-term body-size trends of crinoids over this crucial time interval. Here we compiled the first comprehensive data sets of sizes of calyces for 262 crinoid genera from the Frasnian-Visean. We found that crinoids have not experienced long-term reduction in body size after the so-called Hangenberg event. Instead , size distributions of calyces show temporal heterogeneity in the variance , with an increase in both the mean and maximum biovolumes between the Famennian and Tournaisian. The minimum biovolume , in turn , has remained constant over the study interval. Thus , the observed pattern seems to fit a Brownian motion-like diffusion model. Intriguingly , the same model has been recently invoked to explain morphologic diversification within the eucladid subclade during the Devonian-early Carboniferous. We suggest that the complex interplay between abiotic and biotic factors ( i.e. , expansion of carbonate ramps and increased primary productivity , in conjunction with predatory release after extinction of Devonian-style durophagous fishes) might have been involved not only in the early Mississippian diversity peak of crinoids , but possibly also in their overall passive expansion into larger body-size niches.
