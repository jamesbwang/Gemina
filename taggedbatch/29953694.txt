 Objective screening tool for patients at a high risk of developing acute<symptom> brain injury ( ABI) is necessary for the proper treatment of carbon monoxide ( CO) poisoning<disease> patients. The aim of this study is to identify clinical factors that could predict ABI due to CO poisoning<disease> in patients with an altered<symptom> mental<symptom> status<symptom>. A prospectively collected CO poisoning<disease> registry at a single academic medical center was retrospectively analyzed. CO poisoning<disease> patients with an altered<symptom> mental<symptom> status<symptom> at the emergency department , defined as unalert on the alert/responsive to voice/responsive to pain/unresponsive scale and underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( DW-MRI) between January 1 , 2013 , and December 31 , 2015 , were included. ABI was defined as the presence of acute hypoxic brain lesions<symptom>. Clinical predictors of ABI were identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Of 180 patients , 67 ( 37.2 %) had ABI as revealed by DW-MRI. Multivariate analysis showed that CO exposure duration > 5 hours ( adjusted odds ratio ( AOR) = 7.082; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 3.463-15.014; p < 0.001) defined as the time between CO exposure and rescue , abnormal white blood cell count ( AOR = 2.568 , 95 % CI = 1.188-5.700 , p = 0.02) , and abnormal creatinine concentration ( AOR = 2.667 , 95 % CI = 1.110-6.605 , p = 0.03) were predictors of ABI. CO exposure duration had the highest predictive value ( area under the curve , 0.815) , and the optimal cutoff value was 5 hours. Moreover , increasing exposure durations ( quartile) indicated a stepwise increase in the risk of ABI. In CO poisoning<disease> patients with an altered<symptom> mental<symptom> status<symptom> , CO exposure duration was useful for predicting ABI , which may help clinicians or paramedics identify high-risk patients and provide treatment on priority.
