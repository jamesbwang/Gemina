 Oat crown rust caused by Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae<pathogen> is the most destructive foliar disease of cultivated oat. Characterization of genetic factors controlling resistance responses to Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae<pathogen> in non-host species could provide new resources for developing disease protection strategies in oat. We examined symptom development and fungal colonization levels of a collection of Brachypodium distachyon and B. hybridum accessions infected with three North American P. coronata f. sp. avenae<pathogen> isolates. Our results demonstrated that colonization phenotypes are dependent on both host and pathogen genotypes , indicating a role for race-specific responses in these interactions. These responses were independent of the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Expression analysis of several defense-related genes suggested that salicylic acid and ethylene-mediated signaling , but not jasmonic acid are components of resistance reaction to P. coronata f. sp. avenae<pathogen>. Our findings provide the basis to conduct a genetic inheritance study to examine if effector-triggered immunity contributes to non-host resistance to P. coronata f. sp. avenae<pathogen> in Brachypodium species.
