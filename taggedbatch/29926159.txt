 Progression through the cell cycle is driven by the activities of the cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK) family of enzymes , which establish an ordered passage through the cell cycle phases. CDK activity is crucial for the cellular transitions from G1 to S and G2 to M , which are highly controlled to promote the faithful duplication of the genetic material and the transmission of the genome into daughter cells , respectively. While oscillations in CDK activity are essential for cell division , how its specific dynamics may shape cellular processes remains an open question. Recently , we have investigated the potential role of CDK in establishing the profile of replication initiation along the chromosomes , also referred to as the replication program. Our results demonstrated that the timing and level of CDK activity at G1/S provide two critical and independent inputs that modulate the pattern of origin usage. In this review , we will present the conclusions of our study and discuss the implications of our findings for cellular function and physiology.
