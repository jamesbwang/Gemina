 Deficits in spatial navigation are characteristic and disabling features of typical Alzheimer 's disease ( tAD) and posterior cortical atrophy ( PCA). Visual cues have been proposed to mitigate such deficits; however , there is currently little empirical evidence for their use. The effect of visual cues on visually guided navigation was assessed within a simplified real-world setting in individuals with tAD ( Results illustrate marked deficits in patients ' navigational ability , with patient groups taking an estimated two to three times longer to reach target destinations than controls and exhibiting tortuous walking paths. There were no significant differences between tAD and PCA task performance. Overall , patients took less time to reach target destinations under cue conditions ( contrast-cue: 11.8 %; 95 % CI: ( 2.5 , 20.3)) and were more likely initially to fixate on targets. The study evaluated navigation to destinations within a real-world environment. There is evidence that introducing perceptual changes to the environment may improve patients ' navigational ability.
