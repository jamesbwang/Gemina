 As a central immune organ unique to birds , the bursa of Fabricius ( BF) provides a proper microenvironment for B-cell development. The bursal B-cells undergo rapid proliferation and differentiation at the embryonic stages , but 95 % of them undergo apoptosis after hatching. Few studies have focused on the cause of bursal B-cells apoptosis at the embryonic stages in birds. To explore the cause , we compared the transcriptional profiles of three characteristic embryonic stages in duck , including embryonic day 14 ( ED14) , 22 ( ED22) and 1 day after hatching ( D1). Our results showed that the apoptotic B-cells were first observed at ED22 while there were no apoptotic B-cells at ED14. By performing enrichment analysis for DEGs and qRT-PCR , our results demonstrated that both mitochondrial and Fas signaling pathways mediated bursal B-cell apoptosis during the duck embryonic development. Further , protein-protein interactions ( PPIs) and KEGG enrichment analysis together showed that BMP4 , FoxO1 and IGF-1 may regulate bursal B-cells apoptosis. In addition , the DEGs showed two stage-specific expression patterns. By analyzing the genes of two expression patterns , the results indicated that B-cell false differentiation may be one of the reasons of apoptosis in the duck embryonic BF. Overall , these data demonstrated that from ED14-ED22 , apoptosis of bursal B-cells was mediated by mitochondrial and Fas signaling pathways and could be regulated by BMP4 , FoxO1 and IGF-1 in duck. One of the primary causes of bursal B-cell apoptosis may be false differentiation in B-cells.
