 Cleidocranial dysplasia ( CCD) is a rare autosomal-dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasia that is predominantly associated with heterozygous mutations of RUNX2. However , no information is available regarding metabolic changes associated with CCD at present. We analyzed members of a CCD family and checked for mutations in the RUNX2 coding sequence using the nucleotide BLAST program. The 3D protein structure of mutant RUNX2 was predicted by I-TASSER. Finally , we analyzed metabolites extracted from plasma using LC-MS/MS. We identified a novel mutation ( c. 1061insT) that generates a premature termination in the RUNX2 coding region , which , based on protein structure prediction models , likely alters the protein 's function. Interestingly , metabolomics profiling indicated that 30 metabolites belonging to 13 metabolic pathways were significantly changed in the CCD patients compared to normal controls. The results highlight interesting correlations between a RUNX2 mutation , metabolic changes , and the clinical features in a family with CCD. The results also contribute to our understanding of the pathogenetic processes underlying this rare disorder. This study provides the first metabolomics profiling in CCD patients , expands our insights into the pathogenesis of the disorder , may help in diagnostics and its refinements , and may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to CCD.
