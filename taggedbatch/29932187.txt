 The first example of an N-heterocyclic carbene-catalyzed asymmetric desymmetrization of enal-tethered cyclohexadienones via an intramolecular homoenolate Michael addition/esterification reaction is described. This new protocol offers a direct entry to various functionalized tetrahydrofluorenones with three contiguous stereocenters in high yields , good diastereoselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities.
