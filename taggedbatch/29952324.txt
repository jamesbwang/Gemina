 The objectives of this study were to conduct an appropriate microbial evaluation of warm-water bidet toilet seats. Health-related advantages and disadvantages have been associated with using warm-water bidet toilet seats , which are classified according to the tank type , including tanks equipped with reservoir water heaters and on-demand tankless systems equipped with an instantaneous water heater. However , related bacterial research is sparse. Here , we performed a long-term survey of the behavior of microorganisms ( i.e. , the total viable count ( TVC) , heterotrophic plate counts ( HPCs) , and Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> count) in a university campus. We also examined the differences between the tank and on-demand types , and the origins of P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen>. A low TVC ( â‰¤ 1/mL) in the spray waters from both on-demand and tank-type warm-water bidet toilet seats showed low bacterial contamination , although there was an increase in HPC , i.e. , growth of biofilms , inside in the warm-water bidet toilet seats. When P.<pathogen> aeruginosa was detected in spray water over an extended duration , the P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> origin was considered as either from feces or tap water. Collectively our findings demonstrate that hygienic safety of warm-water bidet toilet seats is being maintained overall.
