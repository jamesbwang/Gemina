 Monosodium glutamate ( MSG) , the sodium salt of glutamic acid , is widely used in modern nutrition as flavor enhancer. However , it has been shown that curcumin has ability to induce apoptosis in the cells of the immune system. In the present study , we evaluate the potential protective effects of curcumin in MSG-induced apoptosis and signaling pathway which may be involved. Rat thymocytes were treated with increased ( 1 , 10 , 50 mM) MSG concentrations and/or curcumin ( 3 Î¼M). Cell apoptosis rate , reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production , mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP) , Bcl-2 , Bax protein expression and caspase-3 activity were determined after 24 hours of incubation. Treatment with MSG resulted with increased apoptosis , ROS production and caspase-3 activity , followed with decreased MMP and Bcl-2/ Bax protein ratio. Inhibition of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity reduced cell apoptosis , indicating the involvement of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Co-treatment with curcumin markedly reduced apoptosis and ROS production , together with increased MMP and Bcl2/Bax protein ratio. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway abolished protective effect of curcumin in MSG-induced toxicity in rat thymocytes. Obtained findings suggest that curcumin may attenuate the MSG-induced apoptosis through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway which could be useful in preventing the potential deficiencies in T cell-mediated immunity.
