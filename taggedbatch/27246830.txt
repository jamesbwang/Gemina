 Colorectal carcinoma ( CRC) is among the most common causes of death. Recent studies have shown that both STAT3 and miR-572 contribute to CRC progression. STAT3 plays an important role in miRNA expression. Moreover , MOAP-1 , which is a pro-apoptotic protein that induces cell death or apoptosis , has a direct correlation with miRNA. Therefore , the current study is designed to explore whether miR-572 and STAT3 are involved in a common pathway and the role of MOAP-1 in this process. The expressions of STAT3 , miR-572 , and MOAP-1 in human CRC tissues and multiple cell lines were estimated by qRT-PCR or Western blot. MTT , transwell migration , and invasion assays were used to assess cell growth , migration , and invasion , respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was applied to examine the association between miR-572 and MOAP-1. Elevated STAT3 levels were accompanied by increased miR-572 and decreased MOAP-1 levels in primary CRC specimens and cell lines. STAT3 promoted CRC cell growth , migration , and invasion via the upregulated expression of miR-572. Subsequently , miR-572 inhibited MOAP-1 protein expression through an interaction with its 3 ` UTR. Our study proposes a novel STAT3-miR-572-MOAP-1 pathway involved in the process of CRC progression , which might be a potential target for the development of new preventive and therapeutic approaches against human colorectal cancer.
