 Nanothechnology-mediated photothermal therapy ( PTT) is emerging as one of the inspiring alternative modality of cancer therapy that applies near-infrared radiation. High favorability of this approach is due to its minimum invasiveness , safety of non-targeted area , quick recovery , and capable simultaneous imaging. In this approach , photoabsorbing nanomaterials convert energy of infrared light to vibrational motion and generate heat. In the present study , a nanocomposite comprised nickel ferrite and carbon ( NiFe
