 Members of the viridans<pathogen> group streptococci ( VGS) are the cause of local and invasive<disease> infections<disease>. Due to the severity of these infections and taking into account that reports regarding epidemiological aspects are scarce , the aims of this work were the identification and the study of the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of the isolates recovered from patients that were hospitalized in order to find out about the resistance level and the epidemiology of infections in which VGS are involved. A hundred and thirty two isolates identified as VGS were isolated at Hospital de Clínicas `` José de San Martín '' during the period 2011-2015. The identification was performed by biochemical test and mass spectrometry by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization- Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry. Streptococcus<pathogen> anginosus<pathogen> group was prevalent ( 42 %) followed by Streptococcus<pathogen> mitis<pathogen> group ( 33 %). In the latter , isolates of Streptococcus<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> were excluded. All the VGS isolates were susceptible to ertapenem , meropenem , linezolid and vancomycin; 25.8 % were resistant ( I+R) to penicillin , being prevalent in the S.<pathogen> mitis<pathogen> group. Regarding ceftriaxone and cefepime 96.9 % of the isolates were susceptible. Only two isolates were resistant to levofloxacin , 27.2 % to tetracycline and it was not found high level resistance to gentamycin ( MIC range 0.5-32μg/ ml). Resistance to erythromycin was 17.4 % with no significant difference between M and MLS phenotypes. The most active antibiotics were in addition to ceftriaxone and cefepime , vancomycin , ertapenem , meropenem and linezolid. These results highlight the importance of the continuous surveillance of the infections caused by VGS in order to predict a correct antibiotic therapy.
