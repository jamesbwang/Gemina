 Sediment inflow to the reservoir is a key factor to calculate life of the reservoir. Flushing is a very useful technique in order to enhance the life of reservoir. From the literature review , 14 reservoirs were considered where flushing has already been practiced and only 6 reservoirs were found successful in flushing. The others were found partially flushed. In this research , data of three successfully flushed reservoirs namely Baira reservoir ( India) , Gebidem reservoir ( Switzerland) , and Gmund reservoir ( Austria) were used to run 1-D numerical model HEC-RAS. In the first phase , the longitudinal profiles of delta were modeled and calibrated with observed sediment depositions. In the presence of available data of discharges and respective reservoir levels , the modeled deltas were used for flushing the deltas. With the help of modeled delta and corresponding flushing discharges , sediment deposition and flushing durations were computed. The simulated flushed durations were 31 , 102 , and 180 h for Baira , Gebidem , and Gmund reservoirs , respectively. The simulated flushed durations were found close to observed durations. Hence , the use of 1-D numerical model HEC-RAS is encouraged for modeling of sediment deposits and flushing operations.
