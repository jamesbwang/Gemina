 Pressure-jump hardware permits direct observation of protein NMR spectra during a cyclically repeated protein folding process. For a two-state folding protein , the change in resonance frequency will occur nearly instantaneously when the protein clears the transition state barrier , resulting in a monoexponential change of the ensemble-averaged chemical shift. However , protein folding pathways can be more complex and contain metastable intermediates. With a pseudo-3D NMR experiment that utilizes stroboscopic observation , we measure the ensemble-averaged chemical shifts , including those of exchange-broadened intermediates , during the folding process. Such measurements for a pressure-sensitized mutant of ubiquitin show an on-pathway kinetic intermediate whose
