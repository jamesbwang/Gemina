 Metabolic incorporation of bioorthogonal functional groups into cellular nucleic acids can be impeded by insufficient phosphorylation of nucleosides. Previous studies found that 5- ( azidomethyl) -2 '- deoxyuridine ( AmdU) was incorporated into the DNA of HeLa cells expressing a low-fidelity thymidine kinase , but not by wild-type HeLa cells. Here we report that membrane-permeable phosphotriester derivatives of AmdU can exhibit enhanced incorporation into the DNA of wild-type cells and animals. AmdU monophosphate derivatives carrying either 5 '- bispivaloyloxymethyl ( POM) , 5 '- bisacetoxybenzyl ( AB) , or `` Protide '' protective groups were used to mask the phosphate group of AmdU prior to its entry into cells. The POM derivative `` POM-AmdU '' exhibited superior chemical stability , greater metabolic incorporation efficiency , and lower toxicity than `` AB-AmdU ''. Remarkably , the addition of POM-AmdU to the water of zebrafish larvae enabled the biosynthesis of azide-modified DNA throughout the body.
