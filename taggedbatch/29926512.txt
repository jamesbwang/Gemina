 Examination of maternal plasma cell-free DNA ( cfDNA) for noninvasive prenatal testing for fetal trisomy is a highly effective method for pregnant women at high risk. This can be also applied to fetal gender determination in female carriers of severe X-linked disease. Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) analysis is a relatively simpler and less expensive method of detecting Y chromosome-specific repeats ( Y-specific PCR; YSP) , but is limited by the risk of false-negative results. To address this , we have developed a combined strategy incorporating YSP and an estimation of the fetal DNA fraction. Multiplex PCR for 30 single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) loci selected by high heterozygosity enables the robust detection of the fetal DNA fraction in cfDNA. The cfDNA sample is first subjected to YSP. When the YSP result is positive , the fetus is male and invasive testing for an X-linked mutation is then required. When the YSP result is negative , the cfDNA sample is analyzed using multiplex PCR. If fetal DNA is then found in the cfDNA , invasive testing is not then required. If the multiplex PCR analysis of cfDNA is negative for fetal DNA , the fetal gender can not be determined and invasive testing is still required. Our technique provides a potentially effective procedure that can help to avoid unnecessary invasive prenatal testing in some female carriers of severe X-linked disease.
