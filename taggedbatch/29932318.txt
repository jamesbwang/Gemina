 While interactions between carbon monoxide ( CO) and mitochondria have been previously studied , the methods used to deliver CO ( gas or CO-releasing metal carbonyl compounds) lack subcellular targeting and/or controlled delivery. Thus , the effective concentration needed to produce changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics is yet to be fully defined. To evaluate the influence of mitochondrial-targeted versus intracellularly released CO on mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates , we developed and characterized flavonol-based CO donor compounds that differ at their site of release. These molecules are metal-free , visible light triggered CO donors ( photoCORMs) that quantitatively release CO and are trackable in cells via confocal microscopy. Our studies indicate that at a concentration of 10 Î¼M , the mitochondrial-localized and cytosolic CO-releasing compounds are similarly effective in terms of decreasing ATP production , maximal respiration<symptom> , and the reserve capacity of A549 cells. This concentration is the lowest to impart changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics for any CO-releasing molecule ( CORM) reported to date. The results reported herein demonstrate the feasibility of using a structurally tunable organic photoCORM framework for comparative intracellular studies of the biological effects of carbon monoxide.
