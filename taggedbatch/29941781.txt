 Conceptual frameworks for understanding animal welfare scientifically are widely influential. An early & ldquo; biological functioning & rdquo; framework still influences expert opinions prepared for Courts hearing animal cruelty cases , despite deficiencies in it being revealed by the later emergence and wide scientific adoption of an & ldquo; affective state & rdquo; framework. According to & ldquo; biological functioning & rdquo; precepts , indices of negative welfare states should predominantly be physical and/or clinical and any that refer to animals & rsquo; supposed subjective experiences , i.e. , their & ldquo; affective states & rdquo; , should be excluded. However , & ldquo; affective state & rdquo; precepts , which have secure affective neuroscience and aligned animal behaviour science foundations , show that behavioural indices may be utilised to credibly identify negative welfare outcomes in terms of negative subjective experiences , or affects. It is noted that the now very wide scientific acceptance of the & ldquo; affective state & rdquo; framework is entirely consistent with the current extensive international recognition that animals of welfare significance are & ldquo; sentient & rdquo; beings. A long list of negative affects is discussed and each one is described as a prelude to updating the concept of & ldquo; suffering & rdquo; or & ldquo; distress & rdquo; , often referred to in animal welfare legislation and prosecutions for alleged ill-treatment of animals. The Five Domains Model for assessing and grading animal welfare compromise is then discussed , highlighting that it incorporates a coherent amalgamation of & ldquo; biological functioning & rdquo; and & ldquo; affective state & rdquo; precepts into its operational features. That is followed by examples of severe-to-very-severe ill-treatment of dogs. These include inescapable psychological and/or physical abuse or mistreatment , excessively restrictive or otherwise detrimental housing or holding conditions , and/or seriously inadequate provision of the necessities of life , in each case drawing attention to specific affects that such ill-treatment generates. It is concluded that experts should frame their opinions in ways that include negative affective outcomes. Moreover , the cogency of such analyses should be drawn to the attention of the Judiciary when they are deliberating on suffering in animals , thereby providing a basis for them to move from a current heavy reliance on physical and/or clinical indices of cruelty or neglect towards including in their decisions careful evaluations of animals & rsquo; negative affective experiences.
