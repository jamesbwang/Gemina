 Coronary pseudoaneurysms ( CPAs) are rare complications developed after percutaneous coronary interventions. They may cause stent thrombosis , distal embolization , and coronary rupture leading to cardiac tamponade. Therefore , high-risk CPA should be promptly treated after diagnosis. They can be managed with percutaneous or surgical intervention. Herein , we aimed to present a patient who developed CPA 3 weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention and successfully treated with percutaneous intervention using a covered stent.
