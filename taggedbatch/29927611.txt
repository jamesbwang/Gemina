 The organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 transporter belongs to the solute carrier superfamily and is highly expressed at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes. Several clinical studies show drug-drug interactions involving OATP1B1 , thereby prompting the International Transporter Consortium to label OATP1B1 as a critical transporter that can influence a compound 's disposition. To examine OATP1B1 inhibition early in the drug discovery process , we established a medium-throughput concentration-dependent OATP1B1 assay. To create an in silico OATP1B1 inhibition model , deliberate in vitro assay enrichment was performed with publically known OATP1B1 inhibitors , noninhibitors , and compounds from our own internal chemistry. To date , approximately 1200 compounds have been tested in the assay with 60:40 distribution between noninhibitors and inhibitors. Bagging , random forest<disease> , and support vector machine fingerprint ( SVM-FP) quantitative structure-activity relationship classification models were created , and each method showed positive and negative predictive values > 90 % , sensitivity > 80 % , specificity > 95 % , and Matthews correlation coefficient > 0.8 on a prospective test set indicating the ability to distinguish inhibitors from noninhibitors. A SVMF-FP regression model was also created that showed an R
