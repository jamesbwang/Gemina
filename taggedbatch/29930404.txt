 To compare the effects of different sized titanium dioxide ( titanium dioxide , TiO Ninety 4-week-old clean-grade male ICR mice were divided into 18 groups , in which the mice were fed for different feed involving ordinary feed , nanometer TiO The change of body<symptom> weight in mice was only discovered in group fed for 1 month , which showed significant decrease of body<symptom> weight in treatment groups compared with control group. And there was no significant change of the liver coefficient in each group. Compared with control groups , nanometer TiO Long term peroral TiO
