 Canonical TGF-β1 signalling promotes tumor progression by facilitating invasion and metastasis , whereby release of TGF-β1 , by ( for example) infiltrating immune cells , induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT). PAX2 , a member of the Paired box family of transcriptional regulators , is normally expressed during embryonic development , including in the kidney , where it promotes mesenchymal to epithelial transition ( MET). PAX2 expression is silenced in many normal adult tissues. However , in contrast , PAX2 is expressed in several cancer types , including kidney , prostate , breast , and ovarian cancer. While multiple studies have implicated TGF-β superfamily members in modulating expression of
