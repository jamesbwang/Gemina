 Examination of urate crystal in synovial fluid ( SF) remains the gold standard for diagnosis of gout , but is not universally available. SF uric acid ( UA) level may be measured by the uricase method with an automated analyzer. The present study aimed to evaluate the utility of SF to serum UA ratio ( SSR) for diagnosis of gout. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the National Center for Rheumatic Diseases , Nepal. Patients presenting with acute ( < 1 day) joint<symptom> pain<symptom> and/or swelling were included. Aspiration was performed in all patients and fluid was subjected to testing for urate level , pH and cell counts and microscopy. Serum samples were also assessed for urate levels , and the SSR was calculated for each patient. A receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted to determine the cutoff value for indicating diagnosis of gout. The difference in SSR between gout and non-gout effusion<symptom> was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance. A total of 181 patients were included of which 77 had gout. The remaining cases included osteoarthritis , pseudogout , rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> and ankylosing spondylitis. SSR was significantly higher in gout patients than in any other group ( P < 0.05). An SSR of â‰¥ 1.01 had the highest sensitivity and specificity at 89.6 and 66.3 % , respectively , for identifying gout effusion<symptom>. The present results indicated that SSR may be used as an aid for gout diagnosis when polarizing microscopy is not available.
