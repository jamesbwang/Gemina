 The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of Cryptosporidium in cattle and sheep from the North Pioneer mesoregion of the state of Paraná. For this , 317 stool<symptom> samples were collected from cattle and sheep on 16 properties in six municipalities in the North Pioneer mesoregion of Paraná. For detection of Cryptosporidium species , molecular analysis was performed using nested-PCR techniques targeting the 18S rRNA gene. Of the 37 beef cows and 115 calves analyzed , four ( 10.8 %) and 14 ( 12.2 %) , respectively , were positive for Cryptosporidium. Of the 12 cows and 52 calves , one ( 8.3 %) and 14 ( 26.9 %) , respectively , were positive for Cryptosporidium; and of the 42 ewes and 59 lambs , six ( 14.3 %) and 12 ( 20.3 %) , respectively were positive for Cryptosporidium. Cattle ( 15.3 %) and sheep ( 17.8 %) were both susceptible to infection. All the properties of the municipalities of Assaí , Ibaiti and , Leópolis presented infected animals. The study showed that Cryptosporidium occurs in most municipalities assessed , that dairy calves had a higher risk ( Odds Ratio = 2,66 , p-value = 0,018) for infection than beef calves , and that sheep are just as susceptible to infection as are cattle , and that further Cryptosporidium studies are developed.
