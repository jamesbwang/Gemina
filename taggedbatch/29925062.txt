 Spleen tyrosine kinase ( SYK) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase which associates directly with extracellular receptors , and is critically involved in signal transduction pathways in a variety of cell types for the regulation of cellular responses. SYK is expressed ubiquitously in immune and nonimmune cells , and has a much wider biological role than previously recognized. Several studies have highlighted SYK as a key player in the pathogenesis of a multitude of diseases. Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> is an opportunistic gram-negative pathogen , which is responsible for systemic<disease> infections<disease> in immunocompromised individuals , accounting for a major cause of severe chronic lung<disease> infection<disease> in cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> patients and subsequently resulting in a progressive deterioration of lung function. Inhibition of SYK activity has been explored as a therapeutic option in several allergic disorders , autoimmune diseases , and hematological malignancies. This review focuses on SYK as a therapeutic target , and describes the possibility of how current knowledge could be translated for therapeutic purposes to regulate the immune response to the opportunistic pathogen P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen>.
