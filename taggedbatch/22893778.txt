 Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder that can manifest in childhood or adolescence by causing excessive sleepiness , hallucinations , sleep attacks , or cataplexy. There is often a significant delay in diagnosis with the mean time being 15 years from the onset of symptoms , which may lead to further exacerbations and a high comorbidity burden. Although narcolepsy is predominantly associated with loss of hypocretin ( orexin) , the role of genetics is poorly understood and , therefore , is complementary to the diagnosis but not confirmatory. We present the case of a child who was misdiagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia only to later uncover narcolepsy with cataplexy. Even though she did not meet strict criteria for narcolepsy type 1 , her history and objective data were consistent enough to make an official diagnosis. In addition , her clinical response to treatment was very positive , further supporting narcolepsy as the most likely underlying condition. This presentation highlights the importance of continued education and research to reduce the risk of delay in diagnosis or misdiagnosis.
