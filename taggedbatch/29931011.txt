 Differential Scanning Calorimetry ( DSC) , X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , Fourier Transform Infrared ( FTIR) and Broadband Dielectric ( BD) spectroscopies were applied to investigate the thermal , structural , photochemical and dynamical properties of a fulgide-type photochromic compound , Aberchrome 670 ( Ab670). In the original crystals , characterized by a pale yellow color , molecules take the E conformation. However , upon UV irradiation of either the crystalline or glassy compound , it isomerizes to the closed ( C) form , characterized by the intense red tone. Although , we have found that such conversion is not complete ( far below 100 %). It was shown that due to UV irradiation as well as heating of the studied fulgide to high temperature ( above the melting point) , the Z isomer is formed. Further FTIR measurements performed on the UV irradiated and molten compound indicated that upon annealing of the sample in the vicinity of the glass transition temperature the Z isomer reverts back to the original E form. The final confirmation of this supposition has come from BDS studies , where the strong shift of the structural relaxation process during time-dependent isothermal measurements was noticed. One can add that a similar pattern of behavior has been observed previously by some of us in the case of tautomerism or mutarotation ( Z. Wojnarowska et al. , J. Chem. Phys. , 2010 , 133 , 094507; W. Kossack et al. , J. Chem. Phys. , 2014 , 140 , 215101; P. Wlodarczyk et al. , J. Phys. Chem. B , 2009 , 113 , 4379-4383; P. Wlodarczyk et al. , J. Non-Cryst. Solids , 2010 , 356 , 738-742).
