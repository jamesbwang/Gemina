 Malnutrition is prevalent across acute care facilities , particularly in older patients , and contributes to poor surgical outcomes. Clinical practice guidelines recommend the early reintroduction of a full oral diet post-operatively. The present study aimed to compare estimated energy ( EEI) and protein ( EPI) intake of patients who received early diet upgrade with those who did not. Patients ≥ 65 years admitted post-operatively to general surgical wards were included. EEI and EPI were calculated and dichotomised as meeting ≥ 50 % or < 50 % estimated energy ( EER) and protein ( EPR) requirements. Mean intake and proportion of patients meeting < 50 % estimated requirements were compared between those who received early upgrade and those who did not at post-operative day ( POD) 2. Thirty-four patients ( mean ( SD) age 72.9 ( 5.7) years , 59 % male) were analysed at POD2 ( EEI: mean 4.2 ( 2.6) MJ day Although the majority of older patients received early diet upgrade and these patients consumed more energy and protein than those on fluid diets , as a whole , older patients ate poorly post-operatively. Fluid diets should therefore not be used indiscriminately and other approaches to improve post-operative intake of older patients , such as fortified diets , oral nutritional supplements and meal environment interventions , should be adopted.
