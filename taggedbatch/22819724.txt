 Traumatic brain injury ( TBI) is caused by physical damage to the brain and it induces blood-brain barrier ( BBB) breakdown and inflammation<symptom>. To diminish the sequelae of TBI , it is important to decrease haemorrhage and alleviate inflammation<symptom>. In this study , we aimed to determine the effects of 2-carba-cyclic phosphatidic acid ( 2ccPA) on the repair mechanisms after a stab wound<disease><symptom> injury as a murine TBI model. The administration of 2ccPA suppressed serum immunoglobulin extravasation after the injury. To elucidate the effects of 2ccPA on inflammation<symptom> resulting from TBI , we analysed the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines. We found that 2ccPA prevents a TBI-induced increase in the mRNA expression of Il-1β , Il-6 , Tnf-α and Tgf-β1. In addition , 2ccPA reduces the elevation of Iba1 levels. These data suggest that 2ccPA attenuates the inflammation<symptom> after a stab wound<disease><symptom> injury via the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines release from microglial cells. Therefore , we focused on the function of 2ccPA in microglial polarisation towards M1 or M2 phenotypes. The administration of 2ccPA decreased the number of M1 and increased the number of M2 type microglial cells , indicating that 2ccPA modulates the microglial polarisation and shifts them towards M2 phenotype. These data suggest that 2ccPA treatment suppresses the extent of BBB breakdown and inflammation<symptom> after TBI.
