 To investigate the effects of Coriaria Sinica Maxim 's extract ( CSME) on microcirculation and oxidative stress of wounds<disease><symptom> in rats with deep second-degree burn. One hundred and eighty rats were randomly divided into normal saline group ( NS) , white petroleum group ( WPL) , silver sulfadiazine group ( SSD) , Coriariasinica Maxim 's extract group which were divided into low dose ( CSME-L) , middle dose ( CSME-M) and high dose ( CSME-H). After anesthesia with burn instrument to burn the hair removal area of rats , these wounds<disease><symptom> were confirmed by pathological results with deep second degree burns.And then , those drugs were applied respectively on the wounds<disease><symptom> , such as NS 、 WPL 、 SSD and different concentrations of CSME. After injury at 48 h , 7 d , 14 d and 21 d , the healing rate ( HR) of wound<disease><symptom> was measured , and the microvessel density ( MVD) , tissue moisture ( TM) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) , model driven architecture ( MDA) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) and hydroxyproline ( HYP) were detected , too. All pathological sections of the wound<disease><symptom> tissue were observed. The HR of CSME groups were obviously increased with a dose-dependent manner , which was significantly higher than that of NS and WPL ( CSME can relieve tissue edema<symptom> , promote wound<disease><symptom> contraction , speed up the formation of eschar and accelerate the proliferation of granulation tissue , which are beneficial to the wound<disease><symptom> healing in the early stages. But , it can inhibit the hyperplasia<disease> of granulation tissue to prevent the excessive scar hyperplasia<disease> of burn wound<disease><symptom> in the later stages. Its mechanism is related to regulation what microcirculation , oxidativestress , NO and VEGF.
