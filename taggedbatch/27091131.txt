 Observational studies are prone to bias due to confounding either measured or unmeasured. While measured confounding can be controlled for with a variety of sophisticated methods such as propensity score-based matching , stratification and multivariable regression model , the unmeasured confounding is usually cumbersome , leading to biased estimates. In econometrics , instrumental variable ( IV) is widely used to control for unmeasured confounding. However , its use in clinical researches is generally less employed. In some subspecialties of clinical medicine such as pharmacoepidemiological research , IV analysis is increasingly used in recent years. With the development of electronic healthcare records , more and more healthcare data are available to clinical investigators. Such kind of data are observational in nature , thus estimates based on these data are subject to confounding. This article aims to review several methods for implementing IV analysis for binary and continuous outcomes. R code for these analyses are provided and explained in the main text.
