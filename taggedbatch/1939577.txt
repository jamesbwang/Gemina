 The purpose of the research is to characterize Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> colonization in healthy population of Algiers , to assess the impact on diagnostic performance of systematic additional broth enrichment , and to ascertain the additional benefits of multiple site screening. In order to more accurately determine the prevalence of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> colonization , the swab specimens from multiple screening sites were incubated in brain-heart broth before agar plating. From 2009 to 2011 , 1176 samples were collected from 459 participants ( 201 adults and 258 children). The additional enrichment detection step significantly increased S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> detection rates ( p < 0.0001). S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> nasal detection was positive in 37.8 % of adults , and the addition of throat<symptom> samplings significantly increased the S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> detection rate up to 54.7 % ( p < 0.001). S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> nasal detection was positive in 37.6 % of children. The addition of throat<symptom> samplings in children significantly increased the S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> detection rate up to 53.1 % ( p < 0.001) and that of anal samplings up to 59.7 %. The overall prevalence of methicillin-resistant S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> was 5.2 % ( 3 % of adults and 7 % of children). spa typing of all isolates revealed a diverse but strongly clonal S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> population structure. This approach involving multiple anatomical sampling sites and an additional enrichment of the swabs before conventional culture significantly increases the detection rate of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> carriers and may prove valuable to improve global S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> infection prevention.
