 TRPM8 has been implicated in nociception and pain and is currently regarded as an attractive target for the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain syndromes<disease><symptom>. A series of analogues of N , N '- dibenzyl tryptamine 1 , a potent TRPM8 antagonist , was prepared and screened using a fluorescence-based in vitro assay based on menthol-evoked calcium influx in TRPM8 stably transfected HEK293 cells. The tryptophan derivative 14 was identified as a potent ( IC
