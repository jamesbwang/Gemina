 ( Purpose) To clarify the relationship between white matter fiber damage and the Ability for Basic Movement Scale ( ABMS) II in patients with stroke in a diffusion tensor tract-based spatial statistic study. ( Subjects and Methods) Twelve patients with stroke ( seven men and five women , mean age ± SD: 61.6 ± 8.5 years) were evaluated using the ABMS II. The patients were divided into the ABMS II good group and the ABMS II poor group. Tract-based spatial statistical analysis was performed using diffusion tensor images in both groups. ( Results) Patients in the ABMS II good group had significantly higher fractional anisotropy values of the anterior thalamic radiation ( ATR) , superior longitudinal fasciculus ( SLF) , inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus ( IOF) , and uncinate fasciculus ( UF) of the lesion-containing hemisphere than patients in the ABMS II poor group. ( Conclusion) ATR , SLF , and IOF damage may affect ABMS II scores in patients with stroke.
