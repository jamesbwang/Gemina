 Survival of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) against oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom> is vital for effective stem cell therapy. The reactive oxygen species ( ROS) result in apoptosis and release of inflammatory mediators. Adipose-derived stem cells ( ASCs) have shown promise for stem cell therapy owing to their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activity. Previously , we showed the benefits of vitamin E against hydrogen peroxide ( H
