 Octopamine regulates feeding behavioral responses in Drosophila melanogaster , however the molecular and circuit mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here , we investigated the role of a subset of octopaminergic neurons , the OA-VPM4 cluster , in sucrose acceptance behavior. Thermogenetic activation of Gal4 lines containing OA-VPM4 promoted proboscis extension to sucrose , while optogenetic inactivation reduced extension. Anatomically , the presynaptic terminals of OA-VPM4 are in close proximity to the axons of sugar-responsive gustatory sensory neurons. Moreover , RNAi knockdown of a specific class of octopamine receptor , OAMB , selectively in sugar-sensing gustatory neurons decreased the behavioral response to sucrose. By calcium imaging experiments , we found that application of octopamine potentiates sensory responses to sucrose in satiated flies. Taken together , these findings suggest a model by which OA-VPM4 promotes feeding behavior by modulating the activity of sensory neurons.
