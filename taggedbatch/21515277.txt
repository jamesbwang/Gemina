 In the current study , Isospora sagittulae McQuistion and Capparella , 1992 ( Protozoa: Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae) is reported from white-shouldered fire-eyes Pyriglena leucoptera ( Vieillot , 1818) in the Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil. To date , this coccidian species was described from antbirds in Ecuador and Brazilian Amazon. In this sense , oocysts and measurements of the description of I. sagittulae from Amazonian antbirds were required from the deposit for comparison between samples from the Amazon and Atlantic Forest. The morphology was similar in all aspects , despite the polymorphism associated with the oocyst shape. DNA sequences for the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 ( cox1) locus of the oocysts had similarity of 100 %. Therefore , these strong morphological , molecular , and ecological equivalences ensure the unique identification of I. sagittulae. Finally , this finding reveals the wide distribution of I. sagittulae in the Neotropical region and indicates that other antbirds in the Brazilian Cerrado should disperse I. sagittulae to the Amazon and Atlantic Forest.
