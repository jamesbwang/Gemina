 To investigate suit-orthosis effects on postural sway during anticipatory and compensatory postural adjustments ( APA and CPA , respectively) in a seated reaching task performed by children with cerebral palsy ( CP). Twenty-nine children were divided according to Manual Ability Classification System ( MACS) I and II-III. Participants were instructed to reach forward toward an object both in a no-suit condition and in a suit-orthosis condition. Using the suit-orthosis , children at MACS II-III decreased velocity of center-of-pressure ( CoP) sway during APA , whereas children at MACS I increased the anterior-posterior CoP displacement during CPA. Suit-orthosis improved postural stability in children at MACS II-III during APA. The suit may assist with arm function control during postural sway when preparing to reach for objects. Suit-orthoses in therapy should be individually prescribed considering the intended activity and person 's motor impairment.
