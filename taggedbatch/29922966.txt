 The aim of this report was to illustrate a case of parathyroid carcinoma ( PC) in a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ( MEN1) along with a comprehensive literature review. A 61-year-old man presented with 9-cm PC causing primary hyperparathyroidism ( PHPT). His pre-operative corrected calcium and intact PTH serum levels were 2.92 mmol/L and 391.7 pg/mL , respectively. The neoplastic gland was removed in bloc with thyroid and central compartment lymph nodes. A literature review was run by searching PubMed MEDLINE from 1977 to 2018 for studies of all types , in the English language only , using the terms `` Parathyroid , carcinoma , Multiple endocrine neoplasia , type 1 , ( MEN1). '' Pathology confirmed PC. Post-operative calcium and PTH levels were normal. A diagnosis of MEN1 was established post-operatively. Seventeen cases of PC in patients with MEN1 have been reported in the literature. 59 % of patients were men , and median age at diagnosis was 50 years , with median serum PTH of 379 pg/mL and median serum calcium level of 3.2 mmol/L. The occurrence of PC in the context of MEN1 is extremely rare. Diagnosis and treatment may represent a challenge , so opportune identification or suspicion of malignancy and adoption of correct surgical approach may offer affected patients the best outcome.
