 Releasing all monosaccharides during acid hydrolysis for composition analysis of polysaccharides has been a time consuming process. In current study , an efficient ( 10 μL sample + 10 μL acid) , sensitive , and quick monosaccharide composition analysis of polysaccharides was accomplished by using microwave-assisted HCl hydrolysis ( 10 min) of the polysaccharides followed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography ( HPAEC) combined with pulsed amperometric detection ( PAD) analysis. Compared to the conventional hydrolysis procedure , this method is an efficient approach for monosaccharide composition analysis of acidic , basic , and neutral polysaccharides and particularly suited to polysaccharides that are difficult to hydrolyse fully such as chitosan , heparin and chondroitin sulfates.
