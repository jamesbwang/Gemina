 Establish oncologic safety using 50 Gy to sterilize tumor bearing bone before reimplantation in primary diaphyseal high grade extremity tumors , determine extracorporeal radiotherapy ( ECRT) graft survival , and analyze factors that affect union at osteotomy sites. Seventy non metastatic patients underwent reconstruction with intercalary ECRT grafts sterilized with 50 Gy. Diagnosis included osteosarcoma ( 38) and Ewing 's sarcoma<disease> ( 32). At last follow-up-49 patients were alive , 19 had died and 2 were lost to follow up. Survivors had minimum follow up of 3 years ( range 39-127 months). Ninty one percent metaphyseal osteotomies united without additional intervention compared to 71 % diaphyseal osteotomies. Additional small plate at diaphyseal osteotomy apparently reduced incidence of non-union ( 17 % vs 31 %) ( P = 0.49). Addition of morsellised allograft did not help union. There were seven ( 10 %) local recurrences , all in soft<disease> tissue. Seventeen of 69 patients ( 25 %) needed removal of ECRT graft. Five year survival for ECRT graft ( removal for all causes) was 79 % and 84 % ( excluding removal for local recurrence). Reimplanting sterilized tumor bone using 50 Gy for tumor ablation is an easily applicable , oncologically safe , biological reconstruction option for primary diaphyseal extremity tumors.
