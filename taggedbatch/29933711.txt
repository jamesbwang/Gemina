 One new quinolinic scandine-type monoterpeniod alkaloid , 3-oxo-scandine ( 1) , as well as seven known ones ( 2-8) , was isolated from the roots of Melodinus henryi. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis. All of the compounds were prepared and evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activities by measuring the inhibitory activity of nitric oxide ( NO) in vitro in RAW 264.7 mouse peritoneal macrophages. Compounds 6 and 7 showed significant activities with IC
