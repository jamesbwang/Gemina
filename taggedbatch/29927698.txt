 International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care implemented Opioid Price Watch ( OPW) to monitor availability , dispensing prices and affordability of opioids. We found that opioids with complex delivery mechanisms ( fentanyl transdermal ( TD) patches , sustained-release ( SR) morphine , and SR oxycodone) had lower dispensing prices than immediate-release ( IR) morphine formulations. Identify the extent that SR and TD formulations are dispensed at lower prices than generic IR morphine and the possible reasons to explain this observation. Using OPW data for 30-day treatment Defined Daily Dosages , we identified where SR and TD formulations are dispensed at lower prices than IR morphine. Then we analyzed national lists of essential medicines ( EML) in middle- and low-income countries to answer two questions: ( 1) Do they have opioids included? If yes , ( 2) Which ones? We then sought information on selection , budget allocation , and procurement for EML. OPW participants confirmed/verified the EML information. Eighteen countries reported higher dispensing prices for IR morphine ( oral and/or injectable) than TD or SR formulation. Injectable morphine was highest in seven and lowest in two ( range: $ 74- $ 742). SR morphine was the least expensive , while TD fentanyl was second. Median dispensing price for IR oral morphine was higher than SR morphine. The EML for 10 countries include opioids in TD and/or SR formulations. Opioids in expensive formulations are being favored over IR morphine both at the dispensing level and in their inclusion in national EML. Governments must take decisions based on efficacy , safety , and cost-effectiveness of medications.
