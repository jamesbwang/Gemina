 AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK) , an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinase , is known as the `` cellular energy regulator '' and a key molecule to maintain the energy balance<symptom> of cells and organism. Recent studies have shown that AMPK exerts anti-inflammatory effects mainly through activating SIRT1 , PGC-1α , p53 , FoxO3a and p300 , and down-regulating the activity of various inflammatory related proteins such as NF-κB and AP-1. This article reviews the molecular mechanisms of the anti- inflammatory effects of AMPK , and provides some clues for the development of AMPK-targeted therapeutics to treat inflammation<symptom> and related diseases.
