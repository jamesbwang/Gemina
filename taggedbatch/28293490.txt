 Symptomatic neuroma after major extremity amputation is a challenging clinical problem for which there are many described treatment options. Neuroma excision and implantation into the medullary canal of long bones offers durability and insulation , and minimizes chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Another challenge in amputees is impaired function and an ongoing need for accessible and functional prostheses that are `` bidirectional , '' in that they provide both fine motor control and sensory feedback. Drawing on clinical experience with neuroma implantation into the medullary canal of long bones , the authors propose a novel neural interface whereby a terminal nerve end is redirected into the medullary canal of a nearby long bone and interfaced with an electrode array. The osseointegrated neural interface aims to exploit electrical signals from peripheral nerves to control advanced prosthetic devices for amputees. The purpose of this article is to present 2 clinical cases of nerve translocation into bone that serve as the clinical foundation of the osseointegrated neural interface as an innovative interface for prosthetic control.
