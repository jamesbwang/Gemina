 Atlanto-occipital dislocation ( AOD) is a craniocervical injury that has serious neurological consequences and is often fatal. High-speed blunt trauma , such as motor vehicle accidents , that extend and put traction on the head can cause this injury. The current recommendation for diagnosis is to measure the condyle-C1 interval ( CCI) using a computed tomography ( CT) scan in the coronal plane and more recently in the sagittal plane. We report the case of a patient who suffered a motor vehicle accident and had concomitant AOD and atlanto-axial dislocation. In this particular case , the CCI method failed to diagnose AOD and the diagnosis was made using the basion-dens interval ( BDI) and other methodologies , as well as the presence of ligamentous disruption at the craniovertebral junction ( CVJ) on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). A 19-year-old female suffered a motor vehicle accident in which she was ejected from the car. Her neck was immobilized on the scene and she was brought to the emergency department complaining of neck<symptom> pain<symptom>. CT of the cervical spine showed concomitant atlanto-occipital and atlanto-axial dissociation. MRI of the cervical spine confirmed the diagnosis with total ligamentous disruption at the CVJ and distraction of the atlanto-axial joints bilaterally. While the CCI was normal , the BDI was diagnostic of AOD. The current recommendations for using the CCI interval method may not diagnose AOD in the presence of associated atlanto-axial dislocation. Other methodologies should be employed including BDI and basion-axial interval ( BAI) as well as MR imaging showing ligamentous disruption.
