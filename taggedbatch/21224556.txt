 To assess the diagnostic accuracy of whole-body MRI using diffusion-weighted sequence ( WB-DWI) to determine the peritoneal cancer index ( PCI) in correlation with surgical and histopathological findings. Twenty-seven patients underwent preoperative WB-MRI , followed by cytoreductive surgery for primary tumors of the appendix ( No statistical difference was found between the WB-DWI PCI and surgical PCI ( WB-DWI accurately predicted PCI before surgery in patients undergoing evaluation for cytoreductive surgery.
