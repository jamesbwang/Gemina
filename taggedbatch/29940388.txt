 Prescription tranquilizer/sedative ( e.g. , alprazolam , zolpidem) misuse ( i.e. , use in ways not intended by the prescriber or without a prescription) is understudied , with little research identifying misuse correlates. Identification of key correlates could identify subgroups more likely to engage in misuse , allowing for targeted treatment. This work examines tranquilizer/sedative use and misuse prevalence rates and misuse correlates across U.S. age cohorts , using nationally representative data. Data were from the 2015-16 National Survey on Drug Use and Health ( n = 114,043). Analyses used design-based logistic regression for past-year tranquilizer/sedative misuse correlates across participants or those engaged in past-year use; past-month misuse correlates were also examined in those with past-year misuse. Young adults ( 18-25 years) had the highest prevalence of past-year and past-month tranquilizer/sedative misuse , with 42.8 % of those with past-year use also engaged in misuse. Mental health correlates were associated with past-year misuse , while substance use , particularly opioid misuse , was associated with both past-year and past-month misuse. Substance use correlate strength was most likely to vary by age group , with older adults ( 65 years and older) having fewer significant correlates overall. This work highlighted young adults and those with other substance use as most likely to engage in tranquilizer/sedative misuse. In particular , those endorsing suicidality and reporting opioid misuse are a subgroup of concern , given their especially elevated rates of misuse and the increased risk for overdose imparted by tranquilizer/sedative medication. Workplace-based interventions for young adults and school-based universal prevention may be warranted to limit tranquilizer/sedative misuse in these groups.
