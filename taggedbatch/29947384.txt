 The internal isomerization , MNC ↔ MCN ( M = Cu , Ag , Au) , is investigated through quantum chemical computations. CuNC and AgNC are shown to be neither thermochemically nor kinetically stable against transformation to MCN. The free energy barrier ( ΔG ‡) for AuNC is somewhat considerable ( 7.1 kcal mol-1) , indicating its viability , particularly at low temperature. Further , the Ng inserted analogues , MNgCN ( M = Cu , Ag , Au; Ng = Xe , Rn) turn out to be thermochemically stable with respect to all possible dissociation channels but for two two-body dissociation channels , viz. , MNgCN → Ng + MCN and MNgCN → Ng + MNC , which are connected to the internal isomerization processes , MNgCN → NgMCN and MNgCN → NgMNC , respectively. However , they are kinetically protected by substantial ΔG ‡ values ( 11.8-15.4 kcal mol-1 for Cu , 9.8-13.6 kcal mol-1 for Ag , and 19.7-24.7 kcal mol-1 for Au). The pathways for such internal conversion are explored in detail. A thorough inspection of the bonding situation of the studied molecules , employing natural bond order , electron density , adaptive natural density partitioning , and energy decomposition analyses indicates that the M-Ng bonds in MNgCN and Ng-C bonds in AuNgCN can be represented as an electron-shared covalent bond. For the other Ng-C bonds , although an ionic description is better suited , the degree of covalent character is also substantial therein.
