 An occlusive overnight intensive patch medical device ( OIP) containing onion extract and allantoin has been developed for preventing and treating dermatologic scars and keloids. Here , we examined the efficacy and safety of the OIP for post-dermatologic surgery scars. This was an intra-individual randomized , observer-blind , controlled study in adults with post-dermatologic surgery scars. Two scars per subject were randomized to no treatment or overnight treatment with the OIP for 12-24 weeks. Scar quality was assessed using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale ( POSAS) and a Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale. A total of 125 subjects were included. The decrease in observer-assessed POSAS from baseline was significantly greater for treated than untreated scars at week 6 ( p < 0.001) and 24 ( p = 0.001). The decrease in patient-assessed POSAS was significantly greater for the treated scar than the untreated scar at week 12 ( p = 0.017) and 24 ( p = 0.014). Subject- and investigator-evaluated Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale scores were higher for the treated than the untreated scar at all visits. All subjects considered the global comfort of the OIP to be good or very good , and no safety concerns were identified. This study confirmed that the OIP safely promotes scar healing after minor dermatologic surgery. This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.
