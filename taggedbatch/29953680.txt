 Hypoxia-inducible factors ( HIFs) play a critical role in inflammatory properties of myeloid-derived cells. The effect of HIFs on myeloid-derived cell functions in organ transplantation remains unknown , however. We transplanted hearts into transgenic mice with myeloid cell-targeted deletions of HIF-1α or its negative regulator von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL) to investigate the effects of HIF-1α inactivation or HIF pathway activation , respectively , on ischemia-reperfusion injury ( IRI) and acute rejection. Deletion of VHL in myeloid cells enhanced mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory genes IDO , Arg-1 , and HO-1 in vitro. In vivo , VHL
