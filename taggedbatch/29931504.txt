 Sarcomas<disease> encompass a group of rare solid tumors responsible for approximately 1 % of all cancer-related deaths in the United States each year. Subtypes include , but are not limited to , soft<disease> tissue sarcomas<disease> ( STS) such as leiomyosarcoma , liposarcoma , pleomorphic sarcoma<disease> , and gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST). Treatment options for patients with STS vary depending on , among other factors , histological subtype. Data from a mix of phase 2 and phase 3 trials have suggested that the orally available multikinase inhibitor regorafenib may have efficacy in patients with STS who have progressed on previous lines of systemic therapy. Some clinical benefit of regorafenib has been shown in patients with leiomyosarcoma , synovial sarcoma<disease> , GIST , Ewing 's sarcoma<disease> , and other sarcoma<disease> subtypes , suggesting a broad spectrum of potential activity in this population. Studies have also shown that the safety profile of regorafenib is acceptable in these patients , with adverse events that can be managed through dose reductions and/or interruptions as well as other supportive measures.
