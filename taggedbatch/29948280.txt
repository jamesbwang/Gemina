 To determine the frequency of oral infection with potential for spread ( OIPS) and behavioural risk factors in patients referred to a regional tertiary care-centre for OIPS assessment and clearance. A database search of all referrals to the Oral and Maxillofacial Diseases unit of HUH in 2009 was performed. Of the 2807 referrals , 408 were due to a known or suspected OIPS. The electronic patient records of these patients were analysed for patient demographics , lifestyle factors , radiological findings and clinical oral findings. Risk factors for OIPS were analysed using logistic regression and using the significant factors in univariate analyses in the multivariate models. The mean age of the patients was 58 years. Most patients ( n = 270 , 66 %) were referred due to upcoming cancer or other immunosuppressive therapy. The majority ( n = 314 , 77 %) were diagnosed with one or more OIPS. In univariate analyses , smoking ( OR 3.2 , 95 % CI 1.6-6.4; p = 0.0006) , male gender ( OR 1.7 , 95 % CI 1.1-2.8; p = 0.02) , excessive alcohol use ( OR 3.0 , 95 % 1.1-7.9; p = 0.03) and irregular dental care ( OR 4.8 , 95 % CI 2.6-8.8; p < 0.0001) were risk factors for OIPS. However , in multivariate analyses , smoking was the only independent risk factor for OIPS ( OR 3.6 , 95 % CI 1.2-11.8; p = 0.02). OIPS are common in patients referred for OIPS clearance , and smoking was identified as an independent behavioural risk factor for them. These findings highlight the burden of disease in this patient group and the importance of smoking cessation encouragement. To identify patients at increased risk of OIPS.
