 We study the dynamics of a Skyrmion in a magnetic insulating nanowire in the presence of time-dependent oscillating magnetic field gradients. These ac fields act as a net driving force on the Skyrmion via its own intrinsic magnetic excitations. In a microscopic quantum field theory approach , we include the unavoidable coupling of the external field to the magnons , which gives rise to time-dependent dissipation for the Skyrmion. We demonstrate that the magnetic ac field induces a super-Ohmic to Ohmic crossover behavior for the Skyrmion dissipation kernels with time-dependent Ohmic terms. The ac driving of the magnon bath at resonance results in a unidirectional helical propagation of the Skyrmion in addition to the otherwise periodic bounded motion.
