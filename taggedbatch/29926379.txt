 Published literature on overdoses related to botulinum<pathogen> toxin A ( BtxA) agents is scarce. The aim of this study was to assess the BtxA drug class ' respective agents for associations with overdose. United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) adverse event reporting system ( FAERS) database was utilized to search for overdoses. The analysis was conducted on data between second quarter 2014 and third quarter 2017. BtxA cases were included when they were considered the `` Primary Suspect '' drug. Overdose was defined as presence of ` overdose ' being reported as an adverse event. Primary outcome was incidence of ` overdose ' compared within the respective agents. Additionally , a disproportionality analysis was conducted utilizing reporting odds ratio ( ROR) versus onabotulinumtoxinA as a referent while controlling for confounding variables. A total of 3,837,406 unique adverse events were reported during the study period for all drugs in the FAERS database. Of which , 13,078 were BtxA cases. The rate of adverse events involving overdose for abobotulinumtoxinA ( 20.2 %; 215/1065) was significantly higher than both onabotulinumtoxinA ( 0.4 %; 48/11 ,323; p < 0.0001) and incobotulinumtoxinA ( 0.1 %; 1/690; p < 0.0001). In the regression analysis , abobotulinumtoxinA ( ROR 73.26; 95 % CI 51.17-104.90) had a significant association with overdose , whereas incobotulinumtoxinA ( ROR 0.73; 95 % CI 0.10-5.36) did not , versus the referent onabotulinumtoxinA. The present analysis showed adverse events of abobotulinumtoxinA were significantly associated with overdose versus the other two BtxA agents. Overdose can be difficult to research , particularly for in-clinic administered drugs. Future studies should venture to confirm these results in new and novel ways.
