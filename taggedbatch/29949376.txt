 Amphiphilic poly ( N- ( 2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide) copolymers ( pHPMA) bearing cholesterol side groups in phosphate buffer saline self-assemble into nanoparticles ( NPs) which can be used as tumor-targeted drug carriers. It was previously shown by us that human serum albumin ( HSA) interacts weakly with the NPs. However , the mechanism of this binding could not be resolved due to overlapping of signals from the complex system. Here , we use fluorescence labeling to distinguish the components and to characterize the binding: On the one hand , a fluorescent dye was attached to pHPMA , so that the diffusion behavior of the NPs could be studied in the presence of HSA using fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy. On the other hand , quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA revealed the origin of the binding , which is mainly the complexation between HSA and cholesterol side groups. Furthermore , a binding constant was obtained.
