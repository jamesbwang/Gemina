 Neuronal apoptosis is a potentially fatal pathological process that occurs in early brain injury ( EBI) after subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( SAH). There is an urgent need to identify effective therapeutics to alleviate neuronal apoptosis. Tetramethylpyrazine ( TMP) , as an important component of the Chinese traditional medicinal herb Ligusticum wallichii , has been widely used in China to treat cerebral ischemic injury and confer neuroprotection. In the present work , we investigate whether TMP can reduce EBI following SAH in rats , specifically via inactivating the PERK/Akt signaling cascade. One hundred twenty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the present study. TMP was administered by intravenous ( i.v.) injection , and the Akt inhibitor MK2206 was injected intracerebroventricularly ( i.c.v.). SAH grade , neurological scores , and brain water content were measured 24 h after SAH. Neuronal apoptosis was visualized by Fluoro-Jade C ( FJC) staining. Western blotting was used to measure the levels of PERK , p-PERK , eIF2α , p-eIF2α , Akt , p-Akt , Bcl-2 , Bax , and cleaved caspase-3. Our results showed that TMP effectively reduced neuronal apoptosis and improved neurobehavioral deficits 24 h after SAH. Administration of TMP reduced the abundance of p-PERK and p-eIF2α. In addition , TMP increased the p-Akt level and the Bcl-2/ Bax ratio and decreased the level of cleaved caspase-3. The selective Akt inhibitor MK2206 abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of TMP at 24 h after SAH. Collectively , these results indicate that Akt-related anti-apoptosis through the PERK pathway is a major , potent mechanism of EBI. Further investigation of this pathway may provide a basis for the development of TMP as a clinical treatment.
