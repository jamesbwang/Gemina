 The role of recombinant A.<pathogen> fumigatus<pathogen> ( rAsp) antigens in the diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis ( ABPA) has not been systematically evaluated. Herein , we evaluate the utility of recombinant A.<pathogen> fumigatus<pathogen> ( rAsp) antigens in diagnosing ABPA. We systematically reviewed the PubMed , EmBase and Scopus databases for studies evaluating rAsp antigens in ABPA. The QUADAS-2 tool and the GRADE approach were used to assess the risk of bias and the quality of evidence , respectively. The diagnostic performance of IgE or skin test against rAsp f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 , f6 and their combination was evaluated separately for ABPA complicating asthma or cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) , using an HSROC model. The reference standard for diagnosing ABPA was the composite ( clinical , radiological , immunological) criteria. Our search yielded 26 studies ( n = 1694) and 17 studies ( n = 1131) for inclusion in the systematic review and meta-analysis , respectively. In asthmatics , the pooled sensitivity for diagnosing ABPA was best for IgE against a combination of rAsp f1 or f3 ( 96.7 %; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 87.6-99.2). The pooled specificity for diagnosing ABPA was highest ( 99.2 %; 95 % CI , 88.2-99.9) for IgE against a combination of f4 or f6. In CF patients , the pooled sensitivity of rAsp f1 or f3 was 93.3 % ( 95 % CI , 55.2-99.9) while the pooled specificity of rAsp f4 or f6 was 93.9 % ( 95 % CI , 68.8-99.9). The quality of evidence was low as per the GRADE approach. A combination of IgE against rAsp antigens ( f1 , f2 , f3 , f4 and f6) is likely to be helpful in the diagnosis of ABPA.
