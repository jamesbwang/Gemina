 Acidic beverages , such as soft drinks ( orange juice and cola) , can produce erosion of resin composites. The aim of this In this Mann-Whitney U-test showed that each material showed lower microhardness values after immersion in acidic solution ( The Filtek Supreme XTE , a nanofilled composite , and Admira Fusion , a nanohybrid ormocer-based composite , showed the best behavior. The Ceram X Universal ( nanoceramic composite) although reached lower hardness values than the previous materials , but resisted well to the 1 week immersion in soft-drink. Finally , the Gradia Direct achieved the most disappointing results: Low microhardness values are justified by the nature of its filling ( microfilled hybrid composite).
