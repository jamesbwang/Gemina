 We analyzed retrospectively the outcomes in long gap Gross type C esophageal atresia. We hypothesized that outcomes in type C ( long gap) atresia differ from type C ( normal gap) and be similar with outcomes in Gross type A and B esophageal atresia. Location of the distal tracheoesophageal fistula<disease> ( TEF) at the carina was chosen as the hallmark of type C atresia ( long gap). We compared the type of esophageal repair , major reoperations for anastomotic complications and gastroesophageal reflux , and long-term mucosal changes between type C ( normal gap) , type C ( long gap) , and type A/B. We analyzed the hospital charts of 247 successive patients from 1984 to 2014 who either underwent repair of esophageal atresia in our institution ( n = 232) or were referred from elsewhere because of anastomotic complications ( n = 15). Among the 232 patients of our institution , 181 had type C and 21 type A or B esophageal atresia. Twenty-two ( 12 %) of type C patients had TEF at the carina and were considered as type C ( long gap). The referred patients included a disproportionately high number ( 42 %) of patients with type C ( long gap). We attempted primary anastomosis in 98 % of patients with type C ( normal gap) , in 95 % with type C ( long gap) , and 53 % with type A/B underwent delayed primary anastomosis. Leakage after primary anastomosis occurred in 40 % of patients with type A/B and in 23 % with type C ( long gap) compared with 6 % in patients with type C ( normal gap) ( P < 0.05). Recalcitrant anastomotic stricture that eventually required esophageal resection occurred in 30 % of patients with type A/B and in 18 % with type C ( long gap) compared with 3 % in patients with type C ( normal gap) ( P < 0.05). The overall rate of major reoperations for anastomotic complications after primary anastomosis , type A/B ( 36 %) , type C ( long gap) ( 27 %) , and antireflux surgery , type A/B ( 100 %) and type C ( long gap) ( 61 %) were higher than in type C ( normal gap) , ( 9 % and 24 %) , ( P < 0.05 in both). Ten ( 47 %) patients with type A/B esophageal atresia ( primary anastomosis not possible n = 10) , three ( 14 %) with type C ( long gap) ( primary anastomosis not possible n = 1 , significant loss of esophageal length after complications n = 2) and two ( 1 %) with type C ( normal gap) ( significant loss of esophageal length after complications n = 2) underwent esophageal reconstruction. Endoscopic follow-up , median length 7.0 ( IQR: 3.0-14) years , disclosed gastric metaplasia in 31 % and 33 % of patients with type A/B and type C ( long gap) compared with 11 % in type C ( normal gap) ( P < 0.05). Intestinal metaplasia was found in one patient type C ( normal gap) ( 0.7 %) and one with type C ( long gap) ( 5.6 %) , ( P = 0.21) , only. The outcomes of type C ( long gap) esophageal atresia are associated with more frequent complications , gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal mucosal changes than outcomes in type C ( normal gap). Outcomes in type C ( long gap) esophageal atresia resemble those in type A/B. The percentage of patients who remain with their native esophagus is , however , higher in type C ( long gap) atresia ( 86 %) than in type A/B ( 53 %).
