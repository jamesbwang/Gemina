 Laccases are unable to oxidize the non-phenolic components of complex lignin polymer due to their less redox potential ( E0). Catalytic efficiency of laccases relies on the mediators that potentiates their oxidative strength; for breaking the recalcitrant lignin. Laccase from Bacillus<pathogen> sp.. SS4 was evaluated for its compatibility with natural and synthetic mediators. ( 2 mM). It was found that acetosyringone , vanillin , orcinol and veratraldehyde have no adverse effect on the laccase activity up to 3 h. Syringaldehyde , p-coumaric acid , ferulic acid and hydroquinone reduced the enzyme activity â‰¥ 50 % after 1.0 h , but laccase activity remained 100 to ~ 120 % in the presence of synthetic mediators HBT ( 1-Hydroxylbenzotrizole) and ABTS. ( 2,2 '- azino-bis ( 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) after 3 h. MgSO
