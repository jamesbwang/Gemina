 Cationic and anionic surfactant mixtures can form viscous films that dominate the rheology and stability of micrometer-sized droplet suspensions. In this work , we use micropipette aspiration to study the mechanical properties of mixed surfactant surface films of anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS) and cationic dodecylamine hydrochloride ( DAH) on alkane and lipid droplets. For octane droplets , SDS was found to decrease the surface tension until a minimum of 5 Â± 1 mJ/m
