 The pleiotropic hormone leptin has a pivotal role in regulating energy balance<symptom> by inhibiting hunger and increasing energy expenditure. Homozygous mutations found in the leptin gene are associated with extreme obesity , marked hyperphagia , and impaired immune function. Although these mutations have been characterized in vivo , a detailed understanding of how they affect leptin structure and function remains elusive. In the current work , we used NMR , differential scanning calorimetry , molecular dynamics simulations , and bioinformatics calculations to characterize the effects of these mutations on leptin structure and function and binding to its cognate receptor. We found that mutations identified in patients with congenital leptin deficiency not only cause leptin misfolding or aggregation , but also cause changes in the dynamics of leptin residues on the receptor-binding interface. Therefore , we infer that mutation-induced leptin deficiency may arise from several distinct mechanisms including ( i) blockade of leptin receptor interface II , ( ii) decreased affinity in the second step of leptin 's interaction with its receptor , ( iii) leptin destabilization , and ( iv) unsuccessful threading through the covalent loop , leading to leptin misfolding/aggregation. We propose that this expanded framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying leptin deficiency arising from genetic mutations may be useful in designing therapeutics for leptin-associated disorders.
