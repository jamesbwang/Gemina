 Sulfur ( S) can modulate plant responses to toxic heavy metals , but the underlying physiological and transcriptional regulation mechanisms remain largely unknown. To investigate the effects of S supply on lead ( Pb)- induced toxicity in poplars , Populus deltoides monilifera ( Aiton) Eckenw. saplings were exposed to 0 or 50 μM Pb together with one of the three S concentrations ( 0 ( low S) , 100 ( moderate S) or 1500 ( high S) μM Na2SO4). Populus deltoides roots absorbed Pb and it was partially translocated to the aerial organs , thereby decreasing the CO2 assimilation rate and leaf growth. Lead accumulation in poplars caused the overproduction of O2- and H2O2 to induce higher levels of total thiols ( T-SH) and glutathione ( GSH). Lead uptake by the roots and its accumulation in the aerial organs were repressed by low S application , but stimulated by high S supply. Lead-induced O2- and H2O2 production were exacerbated by S limitation , but alleviated by high S supply. Moreover , the concentrations of S-containing antioxidants including T-SH and GSH were reduced in S-deficient poplars , but increased in high S-treated plants , which corresponded well to the changes in the activities of enzymes involved in S assimilation and GSH biosynthesis. The transcript levels of both genes encoding sulfate transporters , i.e. , SULTR1 .1 and SULTR2 .2 , were elevated by low S application or high S supply in the roots , and the transcriptional upregulation of both genes was more pronounced under Pb exposure. Furthermore , the mRNA levels of several genes involved in S assimilation and the biosynthesis of GSH and phytochelatins , i.e. , ATPS1 , ATPS3 , GSHS1 , GSHS2 and PCS1 , were upregulated in poplar roots with high S supply , particularly under Pb exposure. These results indicate that a high S supply can stimulate Pb accumulation and reduce its toxicity in poplars by improving S assimilation and stimulating the biosynthesis of S-containing compounds including T-SH and GSH.
