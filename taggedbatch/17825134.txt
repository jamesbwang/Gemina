 Cardiovascular diseases ( CVDs) are the principal killers of women. In this review , we summarize data regarding CVD and mortality after hypertensive disorders of pregnancy ( HDP) , and highlight clinical , research and policy needs to mitigate this risk. Robust data indicate that women with HDP have substantially higher risk of future CVD , with a 3.7-fold increase in the risk of chronic hypertension , a 4.2-fold increase in the risk of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , an 81 % increase in the risk of stroke , and double the risk of atrial arrhythmias , coronary heart disease , and mortality when compared to women with normotensive pregnancies. Potential explanations include ( 1) the effect of pregnancy as a `` stress test '' in women destined to develop CVD , ( 2) mediation by conventional risk factors , ( 3) long-term vascular damage sustained during the preeclamptic episode , and ( 4) preexisting abnormalities in arterial health predisposing women to HDP , and , subsequently , CVD. Women with HDP have significantly increased risk of CVD and mortality. Risk scores including obstetric history are necessary to better estimate a woman 's cardiovascular risk. In addition , comprehensive policies promoting systematic risk assessment and modification after HDP are critically needed to improve health , wellness , and survival of affected women.
