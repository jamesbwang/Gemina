 Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia<symptom> ( CPVT) has been often misdiagnosed as long QT syndrome<disease><symptom> ( LQTS) type 1 ( LQT1) , which phenotypically mimics CPVT but has a relatively better prognosis.Methods and Results: The derivation and validation cohorts consisted of 146 and 21 patients , respectively , all of whom had exercise- or emotional stress-induced cardiac events. In the derivation cohort , 42 and 104 patients were first clinically diagnosed with CPVT and LQTS , respectively. Nine of 104 patient who had initial diagnosis of LQTS were found to carryRYR2mutations. They were misdiagnosed due to 4 different reasons: ( 1) transient QT prolongation after cardiopulmonary arrest; ( 2) QT prolongation after epinephrine test; ( 3) absence of ventricular arrhythmia after the exercise stress test ( EST); and ( 4) assumption of LQTS without evidence. Based on genetic results , we constructed a composite scoring system by modifying the Schwartz score: replacing the corrected QT interval ( QTc) at 4 min recovery time after EST > 480 ms with that at 2 min , or with ∆ QTc ( QTc at 2 min of recovery-QTc before exercise) > 40 ms and assigning a score of -1 for ∆ QTc < 10 ms or documented polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias. This composite scoring yielded 100 % sensitivity and specificity for the clinical differential diagnosis between LQT1 and CPVT when applied to the validation cohort. The modified Schwartz score facilitated the differential diagnosis between LQT1 and CPVT.
