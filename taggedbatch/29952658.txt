 Poor<symptom> athlete buy-in and adherence to training monitoring systems ( TMS) can be problematic in elite sport. This is a significant issue , as failure to record , interpret , and respond appropriately to negative changes in athlete wellbeing and training status may result in undesirable consequences , such as maladaptation and/or underperformance. This study examined the perceptions of elite athletes to their TMS , and their primary reasons for non-completion. Nine national team sprint athletes participated in semi-structured interviews on their perceptions of their TMS. Interview data was analysed qualitatively , based on grounded theory , and TMS adherence information was collected. Thematic analysis showed that athletes reported their main reason for poor buy-in to TMS was a lack of feedback on their monitoring data from key staff. Further , training modifications made in response to meaningful changes in monitoring data were sometimes perceived to be disproportionate , resulting in dishonest reporting practices. Perceptions of opaque or unfair decision-making on training programme modifications and insufficient feedback were the primary causes for poor athlete TMS adherence. Supporting TMS implementation with a behavioural change model that targets problem areas could improve buy-in and enable limited resources to be appropriately directed.
