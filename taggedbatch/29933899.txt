 Epidermolysis bullosa ( EB) is a group of hereditary disorders caused by mutations in the genes encoding structural molecules of the dermal-epidermal junction ( DEJ). Cell-based therapies such as allogeneic mesenchymal stem/stromal cell ( MSC) transplantation have recently been explored for severe EB types , such as recessive dystrophic EB ( RDEB). However , hurdles exist in current MSC-based therapies , such as limited proliferation from a single cell source and limited cell survival due to potential allogenic rejection. We aimed to develop MSCs from keratinocyte-derived induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs). Keratinocyte-derived iPSCs ( KC-iPSCs) of a healthy human and an RDEB patient were cultured with activin A , 6-bromoindirubin-3 '- oxime and bone morphogenetic protein 4 to induce mesodermal lineage formation. These induced cells were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis , flow cytometric analysis and RNA microarray analysis in vitro , and were injected subcutaneously and intravenously to wounded immunodeficient mice to assess their wound-healing efficacy. After their induction , KC-iPSC-induced cells were found to be compatible with MSCs. Furthermore , with the subcutaneous and intravenous injection of the KC-iPSC-induced cells into wounded immunodeficient mice , human type VII collagen was detected at the DEJ of epithelized areas. We successfully established iPSC-derived MSCs from keratinocytes ( KC-iPSC-MSCs) of a normal human and an RDEB patient. KC-iPSC-MSCs may have potential in therapies for RDEB.
