 High unmet need for family planning ( 32.4 %) characterized Burundi in 2010. However , there has not been any study examining the relationship between unmet need and associated factors in Burundi. The present study aims at determining the demographic , socioeconomic and other factors underlying the unmet need for contraception among married women aged 15-49 in Burundi. This study used data from the 2010 Burundi Demographic and Health Survey. Total unmet need , unmet need for spacing and for limiting were used as outcomes and demographic , socioeconomic and other factors as independent variables. After a descriptive analysis of the study population ( This study showed that the likelihood of total unmet need decreased with age after 35 + , with an adjusted Odds Ratio = 0.586 and 95 % CI = 0.423-0.811 , compared to women aged 15-24. Women with 4-5 and 6 + living children had higher odds ( aOR = 1.850 ( 1.322-2.590) and 2.390 ( 1.616-3.534) respectively). Odds of unmet need were lower among women with primary ( aOR = 0.741 ( 0.618-0.888)) and secondary education ( aOR = 0.555 ( 0.399-0.771)). Women whose husband desired more children than them ( aOR = 1.824 ( 1.411-2.358)) and those ignoring the husband 's desired children ( aOR = 2.700 ( 2.176-3.350)) had higher odds than those desiring the same number as the husband. Women who had experienced the death of 1 + sons had higher odds ( aOR = 1.285 ( 1.038-1.591)). Middle ( aOR = 0.670 ( 0.530-0.846)) and rich ( aOR = 0.664 ( 0.541-0.817)) compared to poor , women living in the North ( aOR = 0.611 ( 0.412-0.904)) compared to those from Bujumbura , had lower odds. Rural women had higher odds ( aOR = 1.373 ( 1.018-1.852)) and those who had visited a health facility ( aOR = 0.765 ( 0.608-0.961)) or had access to TV ( aOR = 0.562 ( 0.375-0.843)) had lower odds. Tackling the unmet need for FP in Burundi requires scaling-up male involvement , promoting spousal communication , client-centred services , greater use of media , women 's education , child survival , and pro-poor policies.
