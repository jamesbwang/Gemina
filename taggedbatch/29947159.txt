 To examine the efficacy of biweekly hyperimmunoglobulin ( HIG) administration to women with first trimester CMV infection for preventing maternal-fetal transmission of CMV. Subjects were 40 pregnant women with a primary CMV infection with a median gestational age at diagnosis of 9.6 weeks with a range of 5.1 to 14.3 weeks ' gestation. On average , HIG administration started at 11.1 weeks and continued until 16.6 weeks ' gestation. Within this interval , HIG was administered between 2 and 6 times. While CMV IgG monitoring showed periodic fluctuations during biweekly HIG administration cycles , high CMV IgG avidity indices remained stable over the whole treatment period. The results were compared with a historic cohort with first trimester CMV infection without treatment that also had an amniocentesis at about 20 weeks RESULTS: Each subject had amniocentesis performed. Maternal-fetal transmission before amniocentesis occurred in only one of the 40 cases ( 2.5 % , ( 95 % CI: 0- 13.2 %)). At delivery , two additional subjects had late gestation transmission. Considering all three cases with maternal-fetal transmission , the transmission rate was 7.5 % of 40 cases , ( 95 % CI: 1,6- 20.4 %)). All infected neonates were asymptomatic at birth. Matched historical controls were 108 pregnancies with 38 transmissions ( 35.2 % , ( 95 % CI: 26.2- 45.0 %)) , which was significantly higher than in the HIG administration group. After a primary maternal CMV infection in the first trimester , HIG administration prevents maternal-fetal transmission up to 20 weeks of gestation. This article is protected by copyright.
