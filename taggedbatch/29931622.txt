 Attenuation correction is known as a necessary step in positron emission tomography ( PET) system to have accurate and quantitative activity images. Emission-based method is known as a promising approach for attenuation map estimation on TOF-PET scanners. The proposed method in this study imposes additional histogram-based information as a mixture model prior on the emission-based approach using maximum a posteriori ( MAP) framework to improve its performance and make such a nearly segmented attenuation map. To eliminate misclassification of histogram modeling , a Median root prior is incorporated on the proposed approach to reduce the noise between neighbor voxels and encourage spatial smoothness in the reconstructed attenuation map. The joint-MAP optimization is carried out as an iterative approach wherein an alteration of the activity and attenuation updates is followed by a mixture decomposition of the attenuation map histogram. Also , the proposed method can segment attenuation map during the reconstruction. The evaluation of the proposed method on the numerical , simulation and real contexts indicate that the presented method has the potential to be used as a stand-alone method or even combined with other methods for attenuation correction on PET/MR systems.
