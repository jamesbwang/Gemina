 The efficacy of tocilizumab ( TCZ) , a monoclonal antibody to the interleukin ( IL) -6 receptor , in suppressing disease activity in glucocorticoid-naïve patients with new-onset polymyalgia rheumatica ( PMR) was studied. Its effect on a panel of cytokines and growth factors was evaluated. Three patients , fulfilling the PMR ACR/EULAR criteria , received TCZ at the dosage of 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks for three times followed by prednisone 0.2 mg/kg in case of inefficacy. Concentrations of IL-10 , IL-6 , tumour necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α , IL-1β , IL-10 , IL-17 , interferon ( IFN)- γ , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF) , and leukaemia inhibitory factor ( LIF) were measured at baseline , after 72 h of the first TCZ infusion and then at weeks 1 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 16 , and 22. A slight clinical improvement was seen only after the first TCZ infusion , but was largely inferior to that of conventional doses of GC administered subsequently. An ischaemic visual accident suggestive of GCA occurred in one patient during TCZ treatment. IL-6 was increased at baseline compared to controls , further increased after the first TCZ infusion , and was suppressed by GC. IL-17 production decreased during TCZ treatment and reverted to pre-treatment levels after GC. VEGF e PDGF showed a less constant pattern , but an increase of VEGF concentration antedated visual symptoms. The other cytokines were not detectable in patients and controls. In our small sample , TCZ was not able to suppress inflammation<symptom> at the same degree as GC. As a result , monotherapy with TCZ in PMR can not be recommended , although its efficacy as adjunctive treatment in GC-resistant patients should be further evaluated.
