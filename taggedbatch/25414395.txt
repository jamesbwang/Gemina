 Metabolic surgery is superior to lifestyle intervention in reducing weight and lowering glycemia and recently suggested as treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Especially Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB) has been focus for much research , but still the mechanisms of action are only partly elucidated. We suggest that several mechanisms might be mediated by sphingolipids like sphingomyelin. We measured serum sphingomyelin before and up to 2 years after RYGB surgery in 220 patients , divided before surgery in one non-diabetic subgroup and two diabetic subgroups , one of which contained patients obtaining remission of type 2 diabetes after RYGB , while patients in the other still had diabetes after RYGB. Pre- and postoperative sphingomyelin levels were compared within and between groups. Sphingomyelin levels were lower in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic patients before surgery. Following RYGB , mean sphingomyelin concentration fell significantly in the non-diabetic subgroup and the preoperative difference between patients with and without diabetes disappeared. Changes in diabetic subgroups were not significant. Relative to bodyweight , an increase in sphingomyelin was seen in all subgroups , irrespective of diabetes status. We conclude that RYGB has a strong influence on sphingomyelin metabolism , as seen reflected in changed serum levels. Most significantly , no differences between the two diabetic subgroups were detected after surgery , which might suggest that patients in both groups still are in a `` diabetic state '' using the non-diabetic subgroup as a reference.
