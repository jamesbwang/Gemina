 Common wheat is an allohexaploid ( BBAADD) that originated from the hybridization and polyploidization of the diploid Aegilops tauschii ( DD) with the allotetraploid Triticum turgidum ( BBAA). Phenotypic changes often arise with the formation and evolution of allopolyploid wheat , but little is known about the evolution of root traits in different wheat species with varying ploidy levels. Here , we reported that the lateral root number on the primary root ( LRNPR) of synthetic and natural allohexaploid wheats ( BBAADD) is significantly higher than that of their allotetraploid ( BBAA) and diploid ( AA and SS) progenitors , but is much lower than that of their diploid ( DD) progenitors. The expression of the wheat gene TaLBD16 , an ortholog of the Arabidopsis LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN16/ ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKE18 ( LBD16) , which is involved in lateral root development in Arabidopsis , was positively correlated with the LRNPR in diploid and allopolyploid wheats. In natural and synthetic allohexaploid wheats , the transcript of the TaLBD16 from the D genome ( TaLBD16-D) was relatively more abundant compared with TaLBD16-A and TaLBD16-B. Consistent with the observed variation in LRNPR , the divergence in the expression of TaLBD16 homoeologous genes occurred before the formation of polyploidy wheat. Collectively , our observations indicate that the D genome played a crucial role in the increased lateral root number of allohexaploid wheats compared with their allotetraploid progenitors , and that TaLBD16-D was one of the key genes involved in the formation of lateral root number during wheat evolution.
