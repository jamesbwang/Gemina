 A simple and rapid liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of acetaminophen and oxycodone in human plasma. Acetaminophen-d4 and oxycodone-d3 were used as internal standards. The challenge encountered in the method development that the high plasma concentration level of acetaminophen made the MS response saturated while the desired lower limit of quantification ( LLOQ) for oxycodone was hard to reach was well solved. The analytes were extracted by protein precipitation using acetonitrile. The matrix effect of the analytes was avoided by chromatographic separation using a hydrophilic C
