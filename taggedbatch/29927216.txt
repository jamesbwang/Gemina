 Diabetes and its complications continue to be an increasing global health problem. Hydrogen sulfide ( H2S) has emerged as the third gasotransmitter following the nitric oxide and carbon monoxide in the body , and plays an important role in both physiology and pathophysiology. Recent work has suggested important roles for H2S in the regulation of pancreatic Î²-cell function , as well as development of insulin resistance and diabetic complications. Targeting H2S represents a novel therapeutic approach in diabetes and its associated complications. This review article summarizes the current body of evidence regarding the role of H2S in diabetes mellitus , and especially in its associated vascular complications , as well as the underlying signaling mechanisms.
