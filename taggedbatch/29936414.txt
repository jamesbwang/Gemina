 Despite the well-established role for the thromboxane A We used a mouse keyhole limpet hemocyanin/peptide-based vaccination approach rationalized over the TPR ligand-binding domain ( ie , the C-terminus of the second extracellular loop). The biological activity of this vaccine was assessed in the context of platelets and thrombotic diseases , and using a host of in vitro and in vivo platelet function experiments. Our results revealed that the TPR C-terminus of the second extracellular loop vaccine , in mice: ( 1) triggered an immune response , which resulted in the development of a C-terminus of the second extracellular loop antibody; ( 2) did not affect expression of major platelet integrins ( eg , glycoprotein IIb-IIIa); ( 3) selectively inhibited TPR-mediated platelet aggregation , platelet-leukocyte aggregation , integrin glycoprotein IIb-IIIa activation , as well as dense and Î± granule release; ( 4) significantly prolonged thrombus formation; and ( 5) did so without impairing physiological hemostasis. Collectively , our findings shed light on TPR 's structural biological features , and demonstrate that the C-terminus of the second extracellular loop domain may define a new therapeutic target and a TPR vaccine-based approach that should have therapeutic applications.
