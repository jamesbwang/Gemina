 Although pseudoaneurysm ( PA) formation following primary and revision total hip arthroplasty ( THA) is rare , PA rupture may lead to severe complications that can result in a threat to life and limb. A 65-year-old man presented with acute<disease><symptom> hemorrhagic discharge for one day from the chronic hip sinus secondary to revision THA that had been performed 6 years ago , for which he had received multiple courses of debridement , antibiotics , and implant retention procedures owing to periprosthetic joint infection ( PJI). Radiographs showed septic loosening of both the femoral and acetabular components , with medial migration of the component beyond Kohler 's line. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis of the patient demonstrated a large PA of the right external iliac artery ( EIA) , measuring 6.1 cm Ã— 7.7 cm in diameter and 9.1 cm in length. A ball-shaped antibiotic-loaded cement spacer ( ALCS) was used to tamponade a bleeding PA , treat the coexisting PJI , and thus facilitate endovascular stent-graft repair ( ESGR) later on. The ESGR resulted in complete exclusion of the PA and successfully controlled the bleeding. The patient underwent a successful revision THA 6 months after stent insertion. Neither stent-graft infection nor recurrent PJI were detected at 18 months. Given the potential of a PA for causing significant morbidity and mortality , the surgeon should have an elevated index of suspicion in the presence of intrapelvic migration of the acetabular component. While facing a PA rupture with/without hemorrhagic shock<symptom> in patients with coexisting hip PJI , ALCS ball implantation and subsequent ESGR might be an effective method to save the patient 's life and limb.
