 The goal of this paper is to describe areas in prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV<pathogen> ( PMTCT) programs that could benefit from ehealth and to summarize current evidence of ehealth effectiveness in PMTCT. PMTCT programs require maternal retention , adherence to antiretroviral treatment ( ART) , and return for infant diagnosis of HIV<pathogen>. eHealth systems for PMTCT could either be integrated within MCH ehealth systems or within HIV<pathogen> adherence ehealth systems. PMTCT ehealth messages need to balance maternal concerns about pregnancy , childbirth , and infant care with need for clinic retention and ART adherence for PMTCT. Health approaches currently being assessed for effects on PMTCT outcomes include SMS , phone reminders , and integration of laboratory results and health worker reminders. Randomized trials are ongoing to determine effect of PMTCT ehealth interventions on retention , adherence , viral suppression , and early infant diagnosis ( EID). There is evidence that ehealth for PMTCT improves early retention and EID , while data on long-term outcomes are accruing. PMTCT ehealth interventions may be useful to enhance maternal retention and ART adherence and decrease risk of infant HIV<pathogen> infection. Ongoing clinical trials will be important to determine effectiveness of mhealth approaches in improving PMTCT outcomes.
