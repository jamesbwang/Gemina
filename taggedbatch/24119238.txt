 Cognitive impairments are well-established features of schizophrenia , but there is ongoing debate about the nature and degree of cognitive impairment in patients with schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder. We hypothesized that there is a spectrum of increasing impairment from bipolar disorder to schizoaffective disorder bipolar type , to schizoaffective disorder depressive type and schizophrenia. We compared performance on the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia ( MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery between participants with schizophrenia ( Cognitive impairments increased in severity from bipolar disorder to schizoaffective disorder bipolar type , to schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder depressive type. Participants with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder depressive type showed equivalent performance ( There were fewer participants with schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder than schizophrenia. Despite this , our analyses were robust to differences in group sizes , and we were able to detect differences between groups. Cognitive impairments represent a symptom dimension that cuts across traditional diagnostic boundaries.
