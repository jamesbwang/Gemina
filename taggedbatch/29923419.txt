 Pharmacy-led medication reconciliation in elective surgery patients is often performed at the preoperative screening ( POS). Because of the time lag between POS and admission , changes in medication may lead to medication errors at admission ( MEAs). In a previous study , a risk prediction model for MEA was developed. To validate this risk prediction model to identify patients at risk for MEAs in a university hospital setting. The risk prediction model was derived from a cohort of a Dutch general hospital and validated within a comparable cohort from a Dutch University Medical Centre. MEAs were assessed by comparing the POS medication list with the reconciled medication list at hospital admission. This was considered the gold standard. For every patient , a risk score using the risk prediction model was calculated and compared with the gold standard. The risk prediction model was assessed with receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) analysis. Of 368 included patients , 167 ( 45.4 %) had at least 1 MEA. ROC analysis revealed significant differences in the area under the curve of 0.535 ( P = 0.26; validation cohort) versus 0.752 ( P < 0.0001; derivation cohort). The sensitivity in this validating cohort was 66 % , with a specificity of 40 %. Conclusion and Relevance: The risk prediction model developed in a general hospital population is not suitable to identify patients at risk for MEA in a university hospital population. However , number of medications is a common risk factor in both patient populations and should , thus , form the basis of an adapted risk prediction model.
