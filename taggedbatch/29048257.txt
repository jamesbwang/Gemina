Initial assessment includes a detailed history and physical examination and completion of a frequency volume chart to help identify underlying causes , such as sleep disorders , bladder storage disorders , and polyuria. Treatment with alpha-blockers or antimuscarinic medications may help if the underlying cause is determined to be benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> or overactive bladder , respectively. Treatment options for nocturnal polyuria have been limited to behavioral therapy and off-label use of timed diuretics and desmopressin.
