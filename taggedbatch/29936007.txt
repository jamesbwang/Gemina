 In prior work , the authors demonstrated that two-dimensional speckle-tracking ( 2DST) correlated well but systematically overestimated global longitudinal strain ( LS) and circumferential strain ( CS) compared with two-dimensional cardiac magnetic resonance tagging ( 2DTagg) and had poor agreement on a segmental basis. Because three-dimensional speckle-tracking ( 3DST) has recently emerged as a new , more comprehensive evaluation of myocardial deformation , this study was undertaken to evaluate whether it would compare more favorably with 2DTagg than 2DST. In a prospective two-center trial , 119 subjects ( 29 healthy volunteers , 63 patients with left ventricular dysfunction , and 27 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy) underwent 2DST , 3DST , and 2DTagg. Global , regional ( basal , mid , and apical) , and segmental ( 18 and 16 segments per patient) LS and CS by 2DST and 3DST were compared with 2DTagg using intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICCs) and Bland-Altman analysis. Test-retest reproducibility of 3DST and 2DST was compared in 48 other patients. Both global LS and CS by 3DST agreed better with 2DTagg ( ICC = 0.89 and ICC = 0.83 , P < .001 for both; bias = 0.5 ± 2.3 % and 0.2 ± 3 %) than 2DST ( ICC = 0.65 and ICC = 0.55 , P < .001 for both; bias = -5.5 ± 2.5 % and -7 ± 5.3 %). Unlike 2DST , 3DST did not overestimate deformation at the regional and particularly the apical levels and at the segmental level had lower bias ( LS , 0.8 ± 2.8 % vs -5.3 ± 2.4 %; CS , -0.01 ± 2.8 % vs -7 ± 2.8 % , respectively) but similar agreement with 2DST ( LS: ICC = 0.58 ± 0.16 vs 0.56 ± 0.12; CS: ICC = 0.58 ± 0.12 vs 0.51 ± 0.1) with 2DTagg. Finally , 3DST had similar global LS , but better global CS test-retest variability than 2DST. Using 2DTagg as reference , 3DST had better agreement and less bias for global and regional LS and CS. At the segmental level , 3DST demonstrated comparable agreement but lower bias versus 2DTagg compared with 2DST. Also , test-retest variability for global CS by 3DST was better than by 2DST. This suggests that 3DST is superior to 2DST for analysis of global and regional myocardial deformation , but further refinement is needed for both 3DST and 2DST at the segmental level.
