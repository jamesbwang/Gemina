 Researchers , funders , and institutions are interested in understanding and quantifying research dissemination and impact , particularly related to communicating with the public. Traditionally , citations have been a primary impact measure; however , citations can be slow to accrue and focus on academic use. Recently altmetrics , which track alternate dissemination forms ( e. g. , social media) , have been suggested as a complement to citation-based metrics. This study examines the relationship between altmetrics and traditional measures: journal article citations and access counts. The researchers queried Web of Science and Altmetric Explorer for articles published in HPE journals between 2013-2015. They identified 2,486 articles with altmetrics. Data were analyzed using negative binomial and linear regression models. Blogging was associated with the greatest increase in citations ( 13 % increase) , whereas Tweets ( 1.2 %) and Mendeley ( 1 %) were associated with smaller increases. Journal impact factor ( JIF) was associated with a 21 % increase in citations. Publicly accessible articles were associated with a 19 % decrease , but the interactive effect between accessible articles and JIF was associated with a 12 % increase. When examining access counts , publicly accessible articles had an increase of 170 access counts whereas blogging was associated with a decrease of 87 accesses. This study suggests that several altmetrics outlets are positively associated with citations , and that public accessibility , holding all other independent variables constant , is positively related to article access. Given the scientific community 's evolving focus on dissemination these findings have implications for stakeholders , providing insight into the factors that may improve citations and access of articles.
