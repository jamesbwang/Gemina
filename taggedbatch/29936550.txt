 Apart from the characteristic and progressive<symptom> motor- and movement-related problems , Parkinson 's disease ( PD) patients also suffer from several non-motor symptoms , including gastrointestinal dysfunction. The fact that the enteric nervous system ( ENS) controls motility and that one of the typical PD hallmarks , Î±-synuclein-positive deposits , has also been found in the intestinal wall have rendered the ENS and the gut a popular subject of study in the context of PD. The possibility that these deposits could serve as an early biomarker is obviously of tremendous medical benefit but also the idea that the gut may possibly be a gateway via which the disease is initiated and progressively makes its way via the peripheral nerves to the central nervous system has increased the interest in the ENS-PD link. Furthermore , the fact that gastrointestinal symptoms are present in PD suggests that the ENS might be affected as well. However , despite a large body of literature on the topic , the actual role or the magnitude of involvement of the ENS in PD remains elusive. The multitudes of experimental approaches and animal models have complicated the interpretation of results and the outcome of different studies does not necessarily align well. In this review , we chose to highlight some elements of interest and some items of confusion<symptom> , particularly those where research should be focusing. We also list a number of open questions in the field that could serve as a guideline for future , preferably concerted research.
