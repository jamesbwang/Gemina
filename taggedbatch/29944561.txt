 The aim of this study is to describe a minimally invasive technique of en bloc resection of malignant tumors from lacrimal drainage system ( LDS). This was a noncomparative , retrospective chart review of the clinical and pathologic findings of patients presenting with a LDS malignant tumor who underwent endoscopic prelacrimal recess approach with a small external incision for en bloc excision of the LDS. A total of 12 patients from April 2010 to July 2017 were reviewed in this study. Of the 12 patients , 7 were males. The mean age was 51 years ( range , 38-66 years) , and all cases were unilateral. Histopathology revealed 3 adenoid cystic carcinomas , 2 squamous cell carcinomas , 2 melanomas , and 1 each of papilloma with carcinoma , papillary squamous cell carcinoma , mucoepidermoid carcinoma , B-cell lymphoma , and natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. Epiphora and a mass were the most common presentations. Adjuvant radiotherapy was given in 6 cases after surgery. Eleven patients remain alive and mean disease-free survival time was 25 months ( range , 3-78 months). Two cases with malignant melanoma showed recurrence and 1 patient died of metastatic involvement. Endoscopic endonasal approach combined with a small external incision is efficient method for the management of tumors arising from the LDS.
