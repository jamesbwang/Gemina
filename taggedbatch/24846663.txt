 Menopause is the most important sign of aging in women , and the ovary is the organ most sensitive to aging. Quercetin is a potential antioxidant and free radical scavenger that is widely found in fruits , vegetables , and leaves. However , the effect of quercetin on ovarian aging has not been elucidated , and the mechanism underlying its antioxidative effect remains unclear. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether quercetin protects ovarian function by decreasing oxidative stress. In an in vivo experiment , female menopausal rats ( 12 months old) were intragastrically administered quercetin at three doses ( 12.5 mg/kg , 25 mg/kg , and 50 mg/kg) for 90 days , and the estrous cycles were determined by vaginal smearing. In an in vitro experiment , rat primary ovarian granulosa<pathogen> cells were cultured and treated with H The in vivo results demonstrated that quercetin had no effects on ovarian morphology , hormone secretion , or the estrous cycle in menopausal rats. Although no significant changes were detected in the serum levels of T-AOC , SOD , GSH , GSH-PX , and GST between the quercetin and control groups , the mRNA and protein expression levels of the oxidative stress-related genes SOD-1 , CAT and GSS in menopausal rat ovaries were increased by low-dose quercetin. Moreover , the in vitro results demonstrated that quercetin significantly rescued the decrease in cell viability by H Together , the results of this study indicated that quercetin increased the antioxidant capacity of the ovary by upregulating the expression of some oxidative stress-related genes both in vivo and in vitro.
