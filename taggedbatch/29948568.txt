 No data are available about the effect of MS on oral nucleos ( t) ide analogues ( NUCs) treatment and clinical outcomes in chronic hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> B<pathogen> ( CHB) patients. We aimed to elucidate whether coexistence of MS and CHB affects the long-term prognosis of CHB patients with oral NUCs treatment. We performed a retrospective data analysis for a total of 587 CHB patients who started oral NUCs treatment for the first time in our institution from January 2006 to March 2016. Among the 587 patients , 70 ( 11.9 %) had MS , but 517 ( 88.1 %) had no evidence of MS when oral NUCs treatment was initiated. Cumulative occurrence rates of viral breakthrough , genotypic resistance , HCC , disease progression ( PD) , and overall adverse outcomes ( OAO) were significantly higher in CHB patients with MS than in those without MS , although HBV-DNA suppression and cumulative occurrence rates of HBeAg negative conversion and seroconversion were not significantly different between the two groups. The overall survival ( OS) was also significantly shorter in CHB patients with MS than in those without MS. Multivariate analysis indicated that the MS was an independent , poor prognostic factor for occurrence of genotypic resistance ( adjusted hazard ratio ( aHR) , 22.3; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 6.61-75.02; P < 0.001) , HCC ( aHR , 3.98; 95 % CI 2.07-7.66; P < 0.001) , PD ( aHR , 6.18; 95 % CI 3.43-11.14; P < 0.001) , OAO ( aHR , 8.10; 95 % CI 4.68-14.02; P < 0.001) , and OS ( aHR , 12.29; 95 % CI 2.25-67.24; P < 0.001). MS is an independent determinant of poor prognosis in CHB patients receiving oral NUCs treatment.
