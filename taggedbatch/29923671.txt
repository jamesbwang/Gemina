 Methanol mass poisoning<disease> is a global problem with high fatality rates and often severe sequelae in survivors. Patients typically present late to the hospital with severe metabolic acidosis followed by a rapid deterioration in their clinical status. The hypothesis ` Circulus hypoxicus ' describes the metabolic acidosis following methanol poisoning<disease> as a self-enhancing hypoxic circle responsible for methanol toxicity. We wanted to test the validity of this hypothesis by an observational study based on 35 patients from the methanol outbreaks in Norway ( 2004) and the Czech Republic ( 2012). Comprehensive laboratory values , including S ( serum)- methanol , S-formate , S-lactate , arterial blood gases , anion and osmolal gaps , were used in the calculations. Laboratory values and calculated gaps were compared to each other using linear regression. S-lactate and S-formate correlated better with the increased base deficit and anion gap than did S-formate alone. Base deficit rose to about 20 mmol/L and S-formate rose to 12 mmol/L prior to a significant rise in S-lactate- most likely caused by formate inhibition of mitochondrial respiration<symptom> ( type B lactacidosis). The further rise in S-lactate was not linear to S-formate most likely due to the self-enhancing pathophysiology , but may also be associated with hypotension<symptom> in critically ill patients and variable ethanol drinking habits. Our study suggests that the primary metabolic acidosis leads to a secondary lactic acidosis mainly due to the toxic effects of formate. The following decline in pH will further increase this toxicity. As such , a vicious and self-enhancing acidotic circle may explain the pathophysiology in methanol poisoning<disease> , namely the ` Circulus hypoxicus '.
