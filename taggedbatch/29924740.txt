 Exposure to high levels of glucose may cause glucotoxicity , leading to pancreatic β cell dysfunction , including cell apoptosis and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of cyanidin-3-rutinoside ( C3R) , a derivative of anthocyanin , on glucotoxicity-induced apoptosis in INS-1 pancreatic β cells. Glucose ( 30 mM) treatment induced INS-1 pancreatic β cell death , but glucotoxicity and apoptosis significantly decreased in cells treated with 50 μM C3R compared to that observed in 30 mM glucose-treated cells. Furthermore , hyperglycemia increased intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , lipid peroxidation , and nitric oxide ( NO) levels , while C3R treatment reduced these in a dose-dependent manner. C3R also increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes , markedly reduced the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins ( such as Bax , cytochrome c , caspase 9 and caspase 3) , and increased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein , Bcl-2 , in hyperglycemia-exposed cells. Finally , cell death was examined using annexin V/propidium iodide staining , which revealed that C3R significantly reduced high glucose-induced apoptosis. In conclusion , C3R may have therapeutic effects against hyperglycemia-induced β cell damage in diabetes.
