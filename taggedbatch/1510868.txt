 The aim of the study was to examine the characteristics of alpha wave peak frequency , power , and coherence in patients with schizophrenia. Thirty-one patients with schizophrenia and age- and sex-matched subjects with no psychopathology were enrolled. All study participants underwent quantitative electroencephalography ( QEEG). Alpha-related values , including peak frequency , power , and coherence , were evaluated. Alpha peak frequency on the Oz area was slower in the schizophrenia group than that in the control group. However , no differences in absolute or relative power were observed between the two groups. Significant reductions in absolute and relative coherence were observed at the C3-C4 and T3-T4 nodes in the patients with schizophrenia. Relative coherence was reduced at the P3-P4 nodes. This study focused on alpha variables detected in QEEG as intrinsic values to distinguish schizophrenia from a healthy control. The results suggest decreased alpha peak frequency of the occipital lobe and decreased coherence between the two hemispheres in patients with schizophrenia. A further study could elucidate the causal relationship and biological meaning of the variations in alpha waves in patients with schizophrenia.
