 In this work , an efficient microextraction method was applied for the extraction of some chlorophenols in water samples. This method , termed filter-based emulsification microextraction , is based on the dispersion of an extractant into an aqueous sample solution to accelerate the extraction process and the utilization of a Nylon syringe filter to break the emulsion. After phase separation , the method is coupled with gas chromatography as a final analyzer instrument. The overall derivatization/extraction time was about 90 s. The proposed method is centrifuge-free , and it also provides a suitable sample clean-up by filtration of the extracting phase. The effective parameters involved in the extraction method were optimized. Under the optimal experimental conditions , the method provided a good linearity in the range of 2.0-2000 ng/mL , extraction repeatabilities ( relative standard deviations) below 9.4 % , enrichment factors of 180-203 , and limits of detection between 0.5 and 1.2 ng/mL.
