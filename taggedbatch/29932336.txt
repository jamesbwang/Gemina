 The formation relationship between colloidal magic-size clusters ( MSCs) and conventional quantum dots ( QDs) has not been well established. Here , we report our systematic study on their formation pathways , using cadmium sulfide ( CdS) as a model system. Two Cd precursors were prepared from CdO with branched 2-methyloctadecanoic acid ( C
