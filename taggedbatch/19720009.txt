 The increase in human population and domestic pets , such as cats , are generating important consequences in terms of habitat loss and pathogen pollution of coastal ecosystems with potential to generate negative impacts in marine biodiversity. Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> is the etiological agent of zoonotic disease toxoplasmosis<disease> , and is associated with cat abundance and anthropogenic disturbance. The presence of T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> oocysts in the ocean has negatively affected the health status of the threatened Southern sea otter ( Enhydra lutris nereis) populations. The present study analyzed seroprevalence and presence of T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> DNA in American mink ( Neovison vison) , Southern river otters ( Lontra provocax) and domestic cats ( Felis<pathogen> silvestris catus) in four different areas in Southern Chile comprising studies in rivers and lakes in Andean foothills and mountains , marine habitat and island<disease> coastal ecosystems. Mean seroprevalence of T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> in the study was 64 % of 151 total animals sampled: 59 % of 73 American mink , 77 % of 13 Southern river otters , 68 % of 65 domestic cats and in two of two kodkods ( Leopardus guigna). Toxoplasma<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> DNA was detected in tissues from one American mink and one Southern river otter. The present study confirms the widespread distribution of T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> in Southern Chile , and shows a high exposure of semiaquatic mustelids and domestic cats to the parasite. Cats and anthropogenic disturbance have a role in the maintenance of T.<pathogen> gondii<pathogen> infection in ecosystems of southern Chile.
