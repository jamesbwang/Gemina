 Latino farmworkers are exposed to a number of carcinogens in the workplace. Cancer survival rates for Latinos are below average. This paper describes Mexican immigrant farmworkers ' knowledge of colorectal , breast , and testicular cancer , and compares farmworkers ' cancer knowledge to that of other Mexican immigrants. Survey interviews for this study were conducted with 100 farmworkers and 100 non-farmworkers in 2015 in North Carolina as part of an ongoing community-based participatory research project. We found low<symptom> to moderate levels of knowledge about colorectal , breast , and testicular cancer among farmworkers. Compared to non-farmworkers , farmworkers had similar levels of knowledge about breast and testicular cancer , but slightly lower knowledge about colorectal cancer ( p = 0.0087). Few studies have used quantitative methods to assess farmworkers ' knowledge of specific types of cancer. Our results demonstrate a need for increased dissemination of existing cancer education programs and further research to develop additional educational tools.
