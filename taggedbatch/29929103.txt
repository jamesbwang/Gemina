 During high-solids anaerobic digestion ( HS-AD) of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste ( OFMSW) , an important total solid ( TS) removal occurs , leading to the modification of the reactor content mass/volume , in contrast to ` wet ' anaerobic digestion ( AD). Therefore , HS-AD mathematical simulations need to be approached differently than ` wet ' AD simulations. This study aimed to develop a modelling tool based on the anaerobic digestion model 1 ( ADM1) capable of simulating the TS and the reactor mass/volume dynamics in HS-AD of OFMSW. Four hypotheses were used , including the effects of apparent concentrations at high TS. The model simulated adequately HS-AD of OFMSW in batch and continuous mode , particularly the evolution of TS , reactor mass , ammonia<pathogen> and volatile fatty acids. By adequately simulating the reactor content mass/volume and the TS , the HS-AD model might bring further insight about potentially inhibitory mechanisms ( i.e. NH
