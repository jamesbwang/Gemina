 Regional cerebral oximetry using near-infrared spectroscopy devices is commonly used for detecting cerebral ischemia during cardiopulmonary bypass , and aim to avoid poor cerebral perfusion which may result in perioperative neurological impairment. Today , several devices that can detect cerebral ischemia are commercially available. Although these devices operate on the same measurement principles , their algorithms for detecting and calculating cerebral ischemia are different and no criteria for directly comparing values measured by such different devices exist. From January 2017 to August 2017 , 80 adult cardiovascular surgery patients were enrolled in the prospective study. In each patient , preoperative regional cerebral oxygen saturation values were measured by two different devices and their correlations with various preoperative factors were evaluated. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation levels were significantly higher for values of FORE-SIGHT ELITE ( CAS Medical Systems , Branford , CT , USA) ( F value) than those of the INVOS 5100C ( Medtronic , Minneapolis , MN , USA) ( I value). Scalp-cortex distance , hemoglobin concentration , and the presence or absence of hemodialysis showed significant correlations with ratios of measured values specific to each device ( F/I). An appropriate device should be selected according to preoperative patient characteristics , and factors influencing regional cerebral oxygen saturation values should be considered to ensure the correct interpretation of measured values. This research was conducted with the approval of the ethics committee of our university ( approval number: B16-96).
