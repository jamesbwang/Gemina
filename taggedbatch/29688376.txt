 RNA-binding proteins ( RBPs) may play a critical role in gene regulation in various diseases or biological processes by controlling post-transcriptional events such as polyadenylation , splicing and mRNA stabilization via binding activities to RNA molecules. Owing to the importance of RBPs in gene regulation , a great number of studies have been conducted , resulting in a large amount of RNA-Seq datasets. However , these datasets usually do not have structured organization of metadata , which limits their potentially wide use. To bridge this gap , the metadata of a comprehensive set of publicly available mouse RNA-Seq datasets with perturbed RBPs were collected and integrated into a database called RBPMetaDB. This database contains 292 mouse RNA-Seq datasets for a comprehensive list of 187 RBPs. These RBPs account for only âˆ¼ 10 % of all known RBPs annotated in Gene Ontology , indicating that most are still unexplored using high-throughput sequencing. This negative information provides a great pool of candidate RBPs for biologists to conduct future experimental studies. In addition , we found that DNA-binding activities are significantly enriched among RBPs in RBPMetaDB , suggesting that prior studies of these DNA- and RNA-binding factors focus more on DNA-binding activities instead of RNA-binding activities. This result reveals the opportunity to efficiently reuse these data for investigation of the roles of their RNA-binding activities. A web application has also been implemented to enable easy access and wide use of RBPMetaDB. It is expected that RBPMetaDB will be a great resource for improving understanding of the biological roles of RBPs.Database URL: http://rbpmetadb.yubiolab.org.
