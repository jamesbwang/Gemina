 The utilization of wood-derived building blocks ( xylochemicals) to replace fossil-based precursors is an attractive research subject of modern polymer science. Here , we demonstrate that bisguaiacol ( BG) , a lignin-derived bisphenol analogue , can be used to prepare biobased polyesters with remarkable thermal properties. BG was treated with different activated diacids to investigate the effect of co-monomer structures on the physical properties of the products. Namely , derivatives of adipic acid , succinic acid , and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid were used. Moreover , a terephthalic acid derivative was used for comparison purposes. The products were characterized by
