 Mortality in hemodialysis ( HD) patients is high with significant proportion attributed to fatal arrhythmias. In a pilot study , we showed that intradialytic electrocardiographic ( ECG) monitoring can yield stable profiles of selected repolarisation descriptors and heart rate variability ( HRV) parameters. This study investigated the relationship of these ECG markers with major adverse cardiac events ( MACE) and mortality. Continuous ECGs were obtained during HD and repeated five times at 2-week intervals. The QRS-T angle calculated as Total Cosine R to T ( TCRT) and T-wave morphology dispersion ( TMD) were calculated in overlapping 10 s ECG segments. High- ( HF) and low ( LF)- frequency components and the LF/HF ratio of HRV were calculated every 5 min. These indices were averaged during the first hour of dialysis and subsequently overall recordings in each subject. All ECG parameters were available in 72 patients aged 61 ± 15 , 23 ( 31.9 %) females and 26 ( 36.1 %) diabetics. After a median follow up of 54.8 months , 16 patients died , 20 were transplanted , and 9 suffered MACE. TCRT ( in degrees) was higher and LF/HF was lower in patients who died compared to survivors ( 112 ± 30 vs. 73 ± 35 , p = 0.000 and 0.222 ± 0.418 vs. 0.401 ± 0.274 , p = 0.000 , respectively) and in MACE positive compared to negative ( 117 ± 40 vs. 77 ± 34 , p = 0.017 and 0.125 ± 0.333 vs. 0.401 ± 0.274 , p = 0.007 respectively). In multivariate Cox regression analysis of mortality risk adjusted for age , diabetes mellitus , and coronary artery disease , TCRT and LF/HF remained significant predictors ( p < 0.05). QRS-T angle and HRV may serve risk assessment in future prospective studies in HD patients.
