 The KBI ( kissing balloon inflation) technique is considered the default strategy for the two-stent approach in real world practice. Studies comparing KBI and No-KBI in patients undergoing the one-stent approach have reported conflicting results. The meta-analysis was performed to compare the clinical outcomes of the KBI strategy and the No-KBI strategy for coronary bifurcation lesions<symptom> in the one-stent approach. Five randomized studies were included , and a total of 1264 patients were involved in the meta-analysis. The primary outcome was cardiac death. The secondary end points were stent thrombosis , MI ( myocardial infarction) , target lesion<symptom> revascularization ( TLR) , target vessel revascularization ( TVR) , and main vessel and side branch restenosis. Compared with the No-KBI strategy , the KBI strategy was associated with a significant reduction in side branch restenosis ( OR: 0.44 , 95 % CI: 0.30-0.64 , p < 0.001). A high risk of main vessel restenosis was found in the KBI group ( OR: 2.96 , 95 % CI: 1.74-5.01 , p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in rates of cardiac death ( OR: 1.89 , 95 % CI: 0.60-5.95 , p = 0.28) , stent thrombosis ( OR: 0.98 , 95 % CI: 0.19-4.94 , p = 0.98) , MI ( OR: 0.68 , 95 % CI: 0.33-1.44 , p = 0.30) , TLR ( OR 1.14 , 95 % CI 0.68-1.90 , p = 0.62) , or TVR ( OR 1.27 , 95 % CI 0.75-2.16 , p = 0.38). Compared with the No-KBI strategy , the KBI strategy reduced the incidence of side branch restenosis and increased the risk of main branch restenosis in the one-stent approach. However , the clinical outcomes were similar between the KBI and No-KBI groups.
