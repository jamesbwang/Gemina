 Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR) polymorphism ( C677T , A1298C) has been implicated in increased plasma homocysteine ( Hcy) levels. The present study was designed to investigate the association between MTHFR polymorphism and increased Hcy levels in subarachnoid haemorrhage ( SAH) patients. A total of 150 subjects from North India were included in the study , comprising of 100 SAH patients and 50 healthy controls. Plasma Hcy levels was determined and MTHFR polymorphism ( C677T , A1298C) was screened by High resolution melting ( HRM) analysis. Plasma Hcy levels were found to be significantly higher ( p < 0.001) in SAH patients than in healthy controls. No significant difference in the genotype and allele frequency of MTHFR A1298C was observed. However , frequency of MTHFR C677T genotype , CT ( 53 % vs. 20 %; p < 0.001) and TT ( 15 % vs. 2 %; p < 0.05) was significantly higher in SAH group as compared to healthy controls. The frequency of T allele ( 41.5 % vs. 12 %; p < 0.001) was also found to be higher in SAH patients in comparison to healthy controls. Furthermore , Hcy levels were higher in SAH patients with TT genotype than in patients having CT genotype , whereas CC genotype had lower Hcy levels. The study suggests that higher frequency of MTHFR C677T allele may contribute to etiopathology of SAH through increase in Hcy levels.
