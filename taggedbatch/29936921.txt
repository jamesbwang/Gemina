 Ubiquinone is a lipid antioxidant , and a novel liquid ubiquinol ( a hydro-soluble , reduced form of coenzyme Q10) supplement was recently developed. The purpose of this study was to examine the levels of glucose , lipids and antioxidant capacity of type 2 diabetes patients after liquid ubiquinol supplementation. This study was designed as a randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial. In all , fifty participants were randomly assigned to a placebo ( n 25) or liquid ubiquinol ( 100 mg/d , n 25) group , and the intervention lasted for 12 weeks. Plasma coenzyme Q10 , glucose homoeostasis parameters , lipid profiles , oxidative stress and antioxidative enzyme activities were measured during the study. After 12 weeks of supplementation , glyco Hb ( HbA1c) value was significantly decreased in the liquid ubiquinol group ( P = 0 · 03) , and subjects in the liquid ubiquinol group had significantly lower anti-glycaemic medication effect scores ( MES) compared with those in the placebo group ( P = 0 · 03). The catalase ( P < 0 · 01) and glutathione peroxidase ( P = 0 · 03) activities were increased significantly after supplementation. Plasma coenzyme Q10 was correlated with the insulin level ( P = 0 · 05) , homoeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance ( P = 0 · 07) , quantitative insulin sensitivity check index ( P = 0 · 03) and the anti-hyperglycaemic agents ' MES ( P = 0 · 03) after supplementation. Lipid profiles did not change after supplementation; however , the subjects in the placebo group had a significantly lower level of HDL-cholesterol after 12 weeks of intervention. In conclusion , oral intake of 100 mg/d liquid ubiquinol might benefit type 2 diabetes patients by increasing antioxidant enzyme activity levels , reducing HbA1c levels and maintaining HDL-cholesterol levels.
