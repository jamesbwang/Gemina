 Nitrogen ( N) is a primary limiting nutrient for bacterial growth and productivity in the ocean. To better understand bacterial community and their N utilization strategy in different N regimes of the ocean , we examined bacterial diversity , diazotrophic diversity , and N utilization gene expressions in the northwestern Pacific Ocean ( NWPO) using a combination of high-throughput sequencing and real-time qPCR methods. 521 and 204 different operational taxonomic units ( OTUs) were identified in the 16s rRNA and nifH libraries from nine surface samples. Of the 16s rRNA gene OTUs , 11.9 % were observed in all samples while 3.5 and 15.9 % were detected only in N-sufficient and N-deficient samples.
