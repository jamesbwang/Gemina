 This study investigated the effect of consuming different commercial beverages with food ad libitum post-exercise on fluid , energy and nutrient recovery in trained females. On 4 separate occasions , 8 females ( body mass ( BM): 61.8 ± 10.7 kg; VO2max: 46.3 ± 7.5 mL · kg-1 · min-1) lost 2.0 ± 0.3 % BM cycling at ~ 75 % VO2max before completing a 4 h recovery period with ad libitum access to one of 4 beverages: Water , Powerade ® ( Sports Drink) , Up & Go Reduced SugarTM ( Lower Sugar ( LS)- MILK) or Up & Go EnergizeTM ( Higher Protein ( HP)- MILK). Participants also had 2 × 15 min opportunities to access food within the first 2 h of the recovery period. Beverage intake; total water/nutrient intake; and indicators of fluid recovery ( BM , urine output , plasma osmolality ( POSM)) , gastrointestinal ( GI) tolerance and palatability were assessed periodically. While total water intake ( from food and beverage) ( Water: 1918 ± 580g; Sports Drink: 1809 ± 338g; LS-MILK: 1458 ± 431g; HP-MILK: 1523 ± 472g; p = 0.010) and total urine output ( Water: 566 ± 314g; Sports Drink: 459 ± 290g; LS-MILK: 220 ± 53g<pathogen>; HP-MILK: 230 ± 117g; p = 0.009) differed significantly by beverage , the quantity of ingested water retained was similar across treatments ( Water: 1352 ± 462g; Sports Drink: 1349 ± 407g; LS-MILK: 1238 ± 400g; HP-MILK: 1293 ± 453g; p = 0.691). Total energy intake ( from food and beverage) increased in proportion to the energy density of the beverage ( Water: 4129 ± 1080kJ; Sports Drink: 5167 ± 643kJ; LS-MILK: 6019 ± 1925kJ; HP-MILK: 7096 ± 2058kJ; p = 0.014). When consumed voluntarily and with food , different beverages promote similar levels of fluid recovery , but alter energy/nutrient intakes. Providing access to food and understanding the longer-term dietary goals of female athletes are important considerations when recommending a recovery beverage.
