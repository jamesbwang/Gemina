 The AmpC enzyme normally is expressed constitutively in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , and its overproduction confers resistance to cefoxitin. A newly reported AmpC , the extended-spectrum AmpC ( ESAC) , is related to resistance to cefepime , a fourth-generation cephalosporin. This enzyme presents more flexibility in the active site due to insertions , replacements , and deletions on AA sequences. Many isolates producing ESAC were reported in human clinical isolates , but E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ESAC producers were reported in animals only in France. The animal E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strains can produce this enzyme and possibly disseminate it to human and production environments. In our study , 3 strains of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> from milk and feces bovine samples , collected in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , were suspected to produce ESAC. After excluding other mechanisms of resistance , the gene was sequenced to verify ESAC characteristics. These strains presented replacement of AA in omega and R2 loops , suggesting ESAC production. This is the first report to study ESAC E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> in dairy farms in Brazil.
