 Members of the Triatoma dimidiata complex are vectors of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi , the etiologic agent of Chagas disease. Morphological and genetic studies indicate that T. dimidiata complex has three principal haplogroups in Mexico. However , whether there are differences in the olfactory physiology among the haplogroups of this complex and a possible correlation with their antennal phenotype are not yet known. Antennal responses to 13 compounds released from the metasternal and Brindley 's glands , which are involved in the alarm and mating-related behaviours of T. dimidiata were investigated using electroantennography ( EAG). Overall , of the 13 compounds tested , seven triggered EAG responses in both sexes of three Mexican haplogroups. The sensitivity of the EAG responses show some relationship with the total number of chemo-sensilla present on the antennae. Antennal sensitivity was different between sexes and haplogroups of the T. dimidiata complex. Discriminant analysis of EAG sensitivity was significant , separating the three haplogroups. Our finding is consistent with morphological and genetic evidence for haplogroups distinction within the complex.
