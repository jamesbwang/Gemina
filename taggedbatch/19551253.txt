 Pro Kind is a German adaptation of the US Nurse Family Partnership program. It is an intervention based on home visits targeting first-time mothers from disadvantaged populations. Pro Kind was implemented as a randomized control trial from 2006 to 2012 with N = 755 first-time mothers ( TG n = 394 , CG n = 391). The 7-8-year follow-up aims to assess the mid-term effects of the program. Mid-term outcomes are being assessed by trained assessors. In a multimethod approach telephone interviews , on-site interviews , observations and developmental tests will be held in order to assess children 's and mothers ' life satisfaction , mental health , cognitive and social development , parenting behavior , signs of child abuse or neglect as well as the family 's socio-economic status. Furthermore , administrative data will be accessed to obtain information regarding the mother 's usage of pediatric health care , welfare usage and employment history. Results regarding the mid-term effects of the intervention from the Pro Kind Follow-up will provide a scientific basis for future primary prevention programs as well as help stakeholders legitimizing early childhood investments.
