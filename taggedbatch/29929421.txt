 It was recently shown that removal of GreA , a transcription fidelity factor , enhances DNA break repair. This counterintuitive result , arising from unresolved backtracked RNA polymerase impeding DNA resection and thereby facilitating RecA-loading , leads to an interesting corollary: error-free full-length transcripts and broken chromosomes. Therefore , transcription fidelity may compromise genomic integrity.
