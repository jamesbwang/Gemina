 Currently , treatment options for patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer remain limited. The current standard of care treatment for advanced endometrial carcinoma is a platinum doublet chemotherapy. Second-line treatment options overall are very limited. There is no optimal treatment option for patients who show disease progression with first-line therapy. Therefore , novel and more efficacious therapies for patients with advanced or recurrent disease are needed. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated a very impressive safety profile and anti-tumor activity in patients with programmed death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1) positive endometrial cancer who were pre-treated with chemotherapy. We have done a detailed review of the literature to emphasize the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer.
