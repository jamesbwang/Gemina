 The question of whether orthotopic neobladder ( ONB) reconstruction is superior to ileal conduit diversion ( ICD) with respect to health-related quality of life ( HRQoL) remains controversial. The goal of this study is to perform a meta-analysis to compare post-ICD and post-ONB HRQoL in patients with bladder cancer. A systematic search of Medline , Embase , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , and the annual congress abstracts of the European Association of Urology ( EAU) , the American Urological Association ( AUA) and the Société Internationale d'Urologie ( SIU) up to June 2017 was conducted to identify all relevant clinical trials using validated questionnaires to assess HRQoL. A systematic review and meta-analysis were then performed. A total of 2507 patients from 26 eligible studies were included. Meta-analyses showed significant differences favouring ONB patients in global health status ( WMD + 9.13 , p = 0.004) , physical functioning ( WMD + 11.57 , p = 0.0001) , role functioning ( WMD + 9.64 , p = 0.002) , and social functioning ( WMD + 6.81 , p = 0.03) based on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire and in the total score of FACT questionnaire ( WMD + 6.80 , p = 0.001). However , ONB patients were more likely to have postoperative urinary<symptom> symptoms<symptom> than ICD patients ( WMD- 22.19 , p = 0.0001). ONB patients are more likely to have a better global health status than ICD patients. Regardless of the type of urinary diversion ( UD) surgery , a gradual improvement in HRQoL over preoperative status tended to stabilise after 12 months postoperatively.
