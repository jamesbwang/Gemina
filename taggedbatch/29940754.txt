 The aim of this study was to assess breast self-examination ( BSE) practice in a representative sample of Greek midwives and midwifery students. Breast self-examination ( BSE) is infrequent in healthcare professionals , including physicians and nurses. All midwives ( n = 245) and graduating midwifery students ( n = 165) who attended a congress of midwives were eligible for participation in the study. A self-administered , anonymous questionnaire was developed to assess BSE practice. Midwives performed BSE more frequently than students ( p ent: BSE education should be included in the curricula of midwifery schools in order to increase BSE frequency , improve BSE accuracy and promote BSE teaching to patients.
