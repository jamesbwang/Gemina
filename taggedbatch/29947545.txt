 The endothelin axis ( endothelins and their receptors) is strongly involved in physiological and pathological processes. ET-1 plays a crucial role in particular in tumor diseases. Endothelin-1 receptors ( ET ( A) and ET ( B)) are deregulated and overexpressed in several tumors such as melanoma and glioma. We studied the binding of 24 monoclonal antibodies directed against human ET ( B) receptors ( hET ( B)) to different melanoma cell lines. Few of these mAbs bound to all the melanoma cell lines. One of them , rendomab B49 , bound to ET ( B) receptors expressed at the surface of human glioma stem cells. More recently , we produced new antibodies directed against human ET ( A) receptor ( hET ( A)). Several antibodies have been isolated and have been screened on different tumoral cells lines. As for the mAbs directed against the hET ( B) receptor only some of new antibodies directed against ET ( A) receptor are capable to bind the human tumoral cell lines. Rendomab A63 directed against hET ( A) is one of them. We report the specificity and binding properties of these mAbs and consider their potential use in diagnosis by an in vivo imaging approach.
