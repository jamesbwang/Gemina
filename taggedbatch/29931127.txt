 Differences in behavior and life history traits between females and males are the basis of divergent selective pressures between sexes. It has been suggested that a way for the two sexes to deal with different life history requirements is through sex-biased gene expression. In this study , we performed a comparative sex-biased gene expression analysis of the combined eye and brain transcriptome from five Heliconius species , H. charithonia , H. sara , H. erato , H. melpomene and H. doris , representing five of the main clades from the Heliconius phylogeny. We found that the degree of sexual dimorphism in gene expression is not conserved across Heliconius. Most of the sex-biased genes identified in each species are not sex-biased in any other , suggesting that sexual selection might have driven sexually dimorphic gene expression. Only three genes shared sex-biased expression across multiple species: ultraviolet opsin UVRh1 and orthologs of Drosophila Kr√ºppel-homolog 1 and CG9492. We also observed that in some species female-biased genes have higher evolutionary rates , but in others , male-biased genes show the fastest rates when compared with unbiased genes , suggesting that selective forces driving sex-biased gene evolution in Heliconius act in a sex- and species-specific manner. Furthermore , we found dosage compensation in all the Heliconius tested , providing additional evidence for the conservation of dosage compensation across Lepidoptera. Finally , sex-biased genes are significantly enriched on the Z , a pattern that could be a result of sexually antagonistic selection.
