 A new method for identifying people by their odor is proposed. In this approach , subjects are characterized by a GC Ã— GC-MS chromatogram of a sample of their hand odor. The method is based on the definition of a distance between odor chromatograms and the application of Bayesian hypothesis testing. Using a calibration panel of subjects for whom several odor chromatograms are available , the densities of the distance between chromatograms of the same person , and between chromatograms of different persons are estimated. Given the distance between a reference and a query chromatogram , the Bayesian framework provides an estimate of the probability that the corresponding two odor samples come from the same person. We tested the method on a panel that is fully independent from the calibration panel , with promising results for forensic applications.
