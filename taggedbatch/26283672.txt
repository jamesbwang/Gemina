 Care transitions programs have been shown to reduce hospital readmissions. The main objective of this study was to evaluate effects of the Mayo Clinic Care Transitions ( MCCTs) Program on potentially preventable and nonpreventable 30-day unplanned readmissions among high-risk elders. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients enrolled in MCCT following hospitalization and propensity score-matched controls receiving usual primary care. The subjects were primary care patients , who were 60 years or older , at high-risk for readmission , and hospitalized for any cause between January 1 , 2011 and June 30 , 2013. Hospital readmission within 30 days. The 3M algorithm was used to identify potentially preventable readmissions. Readmissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions , a subset of preventable readmissions identified by the 3M algorithm , were also assessed. The study cohort included 365 pairs of MCCT enrollees and propensity score-matched controls. Patients were similar in age ( mean 83 y) and other baseline demographic and clinical characteristics , including reason for index hospitalization. MCCT enrollees had a significantly lower all-cause readmission rate ( 12.4 % ( 95 % confidence interval: CI , 8.9-15.7) vs. 20.1 % ( 15.8-24.1); P = 0.004) resulting from a decrease in potentially preventable readmissions ( 8.4 % ( 95 % CI , 5.5-11.3) vs. 14.3 % ( 95 % CI , 10.5-17.9); P = 0.01). Few potentially preventable readmissions were for ambulatory care sensitive conditions ( 6.7 % vs. 12.0 %). The rates of nonpotentially preventable readmissions were similar ( 4.3 % ( 95 % CI , 2.2-6.5) vs. 6.7 % ( 95 % CI , 4.0-9.4); P = 0.16). Potentially preventable readmissions were reduced by 44 % ( hazard ratio , 0.56; 95 % CI , 0.36-0.88; P = 0.01) with no change in other readmissions. The MCCT significantly reduces preventable readmissions , suggesting that access to multidisciplinary care can reduce readmissions and improve outcomes for high-risk elders.
