 Although posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD; DSM-V 309.82) and anxiety<symptom> disorders ( DSM-V 300. xx) are widely spread mental disorders , the effectiveness of their therapy is still unsatisfying. Non-invasive brain-stimulation techniques like transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS) might be an option to improve extinction learning , which is a main functional factor of exposure-based therapy for anxiety<symptom> disorders. To examine this hypothesis , we used a fear conditioning paradigm with female faces as conditioned stimuli ( CS) and a 95-dB female scream as unconditioned stimulus ( UCS). We aimed to perform a tDCS of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC) , which is mainly involved in the control of extinction-processes. Therefore , we applied two 4 Ã— 4 cm electrodes approximately at the EEG-positions F7 and F8 and used a direct current of 1.5 mA. The 20-min stimulation was started during a 10-min break between acquisition and extinction and went on overall extinction-trials. The healthy participants were randomly assigned in two double-blinded process into two sham stimulation and two verum stimulation groups with opposite current flow directions. To measure the fear reactions , we used skin conductance responses ( SCR) and subjective ratings. We performed a generalized estimating equations model for the SCR to assess the impact of tDCS and current flow direction on extinction processes for all subjects that showed a successful conditioning (
