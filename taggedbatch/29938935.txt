 This review article describes the use of fibrin glue or fibrin sealants and their development over the past 5 years , with a focus on cardiac surgery. The roles of various types of sealants that are available in hemostasis control are reviewed briefly , together with the various potential risks and side effects of their use. The results of experimental work reported during the last 5 years , clinical data from the same period and the safety aspects of fibrin-based glues and sealants are summarized , showing many advantages of their clinical application over the use of synthetic glues or sealants that may be stronger in some cases , but less safe. It can be concluded that the widespread use of fibrin sealants is fully justified , as it benefits the patient as well as the surgeon through the improved control of hemostasis without increasing any adverse effects or complications during surgical procedures.
