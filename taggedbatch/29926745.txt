 Objective To investigate survival of cartilage repair in the knee by microfracture ( MFX; n = 119) or mosaicplasty osteochondral autograft transfer ( OAT; n = 84). Design For survival analyses , `` failure '' was defined as the event of a patient reporting a Lysholm score < 65 or undergoing an ipsilateral knee replacement. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for construction of a survival functions plot for the event `` failure. '' Log rank ( Mantel-Cox) test was used for comparison of survival distributions in the 2 groups. Results The long-term failure rate ( 62 % overall) was significantly higher in the MFX group ( 66 %) compared with the OAT group ( 51 % , P = 0.01). Furthermore , the mean time to failure was significantly shorter ( P < 0.001) in the MFX group , 4.0 years ( SD 4.1) compared with the OAT group , 8.4 years ( SD 4.8). In the OAT group , the survival rate stayed higher than 80 % for the first 7 years , and higher than 60 % for 15 years , while the survival rate dropped to less than 80 % within 12 months , and to less than 60 % within 3 years in the MFX group , log rank ( Mantel-Cox) 20.295 ( P < 0.001). The same pattern was found in a subgroup of patients ( n = 134) of same age ( < 51 years) and size of treated lesion<symptom> ( < 500 mm
