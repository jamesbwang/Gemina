 Smoking has been associated with depression<symptom> in the general population. Whether passive smoking is also associated with postpartum depression<symptom> ( PPD) is uncertain. From 2010 to 2012 , we recruited 8842 pregnant women in Tianjin , China. The mainland Chinese version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression<symptom> Scale was used to evaluate postpartum depressive symptoms after birth , with a score of > 9 defining postpartum depression<symptom>. Data were collected using specially-designed questionnaires or data from the electronic database of Tianjin Maternal and Child Health Information System. Odds ratios ( OR) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI) were obtained for the association of smoking status with PPD using binary logistic regression. Passive smoke exposure rates before and during pregnancy were 40.9 % and 52.1 % , respectively. A total of 8.5 % ( n = 747) of participants had PPD. Compared to those not exposed , women passively exposed to smoke before and during pregnancy had higher odds of PPD ( before pregnancy: OR: 1.24 , 95 % CI: 1.03-1.50; during pregnancy: OR: 1.43 , 95 % CI: 1.16-1.77) after adjustment for confounding factors. Passive smoking before and during pregnancy were associated with PPD in Chinese women. Reducing passive smoke exposure may reduce PPD in Chinese women; further longitudinal studies are warranted to replicate these findings.
