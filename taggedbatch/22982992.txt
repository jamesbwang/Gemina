 The goal of this study was to analyze the association between the FTO rs17817449 ( G > T) , G protein beta3 subunit ( GNB3) C825T and Melanocortin 4 receptor ( MC4R) A822G single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) with obesity in Saudi subjects. The subjects were divided into 2 groups according to BMI: Obese ( BMI > 29.9) and non- obese control ( BMI < 24.9). Genotyping of the target genes were determined by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis ( RFLP). We demonstrated the association of the FTO genotype TT with increased weight , BMI and leptin levels in both males and females. However , there was no association of genotype TT with fasting blood glucose , triglycerides and cholesterol levels. Regarding GNB3 rs5443 polymorphism , the likelihood of obesity was linked to the TT genotype which was also associated with increased leptin levels. On the other hand , the SNP of MC4R A822G did not exhibit any significant association with obesity among studied subjects and showed only the presence of homozygous AA genotype. The polymorphism of FTO gene rs17817449 and GNB3 gene rs5443 ( C825T) may be a genetic determinant of obesity in Saudi population whereas impact of MC4R Asn274Ser change could not be detected.
