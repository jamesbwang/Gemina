 Health-related quality of life ( HRQoL) measures provide patient-centred evaluations of response to treatment. In the 12-week , Phase III PSO-ABLE study , fixed-combination calcipotriol 50 Î¼g/g as hydrate ( Cal) plus betamethasone 0.5 mg/g as dipropionate ( BD) aerosol foam was significantly more effective for the treatment of psoriasis than Cal/BD gel. To compare HRQoL in mild-severe psoriasis vulgaris<pathogen> patients ( involving 2-30 % body surface area) over 12 weeks of treatment with Cal/BD foam or gel. HRQoL was assessed using: Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI) , EuroQoL-5D-5L-PSO ( EQ-5D) , and Psoriasis QoL ( PQoL-12) questionnaires ( baseline , Weeks 4 , 8 and 12); DLQI score of 0/1 ( range: 0-30) and weighted EQ-5D utility index score of 1 ( range: 0-1) indicates there is no impact on a patient 's QoL and perfect health , respectively. Itch , itch-related sleep loss , and work impairment were also assessed. In total , 463 patients were randomized to the study ( Cal/BD foam , n = 185; Cal/BD gel , n = 188; foam vehicle , n = 47; gel vehicle , n = 43). Significantly more Cal/BD foam patients achieved DLQI scores of 0/1 at Weeks 4 ( 45.7 % vs 32.4 %; p = 0.013) and 12 ( 60.5 % vs 44.1 %; p = 0.003) than Cal/BD gel patients. Cal/BD foam significantly improved EQ-5D utility index ( 0.09 vs 0.03; p < 0.001) and PQoL-12 scores ( -2.23 vs -2.07; p = 0.029) from baseline to Week 4 versus Cal/BD gel. Itch , itch-related sleep loss , and work impairment improved more with Cal/BD foam than gel. Cal/BD foam demonstrated greater HRQoL improvement in patients with psoriasis than Cal/BD gel over 12 weeks of treatment.
