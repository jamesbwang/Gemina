 In this article , we describe a Y2H interaction mapping protocol for systematically screening medium-to-large collections of open reading frames ( ORFs) against each other. The protocol is well suited for analysis of focused networks , for modules of interest , assembling genome-scale interactome maps , and investigating host-microbe interactions. The four-step high-throughput protocol has a demonstrated low false-discovery rate that is essential for producing meaningful network maps. Following the assembly of yeast expression clones from an existing ORFeome collection , we describe in detail the four-step procedure that begins with the primary screen using minipools , followed by secondary verification of primary positives , identification of candidate interaction pairs by sequencing , and a final verification step using fresh inoculants. In addition to this core protocol , aspects of network mapping and quality control will be discussed briefly. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
