 Cardiac hypertrophy is one of the major risk factors for chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. The role of endophilinA2 ( EndoA2) in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and clathrin-independent endocytosis is well documented. In the present study , we tested the hypothesis that EndoA2 protects against angiotensin II ( Ang II)- induced cardiac hypertrophy by mediating intracellular angiotensin II type 1 receptor ( AT1-R) trafficking in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes ( NRCMs). Cardiac hypertrophy was evaluated by using cell surface area and quantitative RT-PCR ( qPCR) analyses. For the first time , we found that EndoA2 attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis<disease> induced by Ang II. Moreover , EndoA2 inhibited apoptosis induced by excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ERS) , which accounted for the beneficial effects of EndoA2 on cardiac hypertrophy. We further revealed that there was an interaction between EndoA2 and AT1-R. The expression levels of EndoA2 , which inhibits AT1-R transport from the cytoplasm to the membrane , and the interaction between EndoA2 and AT1-R were obviously decreased after Ang II treatment. Furthermore , Ang II inhibited the co-localization of AT1-R with GRP-78 , which was reversed by EndoA2 overexpression. In conclusion , our results suggested that EndoA2 plays a role in protecting against cardiac hypertrophy induced by Ang II , possibly by inhibiting AT1-R transport from the cytoplasm to the membrane to suppress signal transduction.
