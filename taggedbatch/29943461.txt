 Currently , innovative methods to prevent photoaging are needed. Skin-derived precursors ( SKP) have been shown to play a crucial role in resisting UVB-induced apoptosis in vitro. The objective of this study was to explore the effect of SKP on preventing skin photoaging in vivo. Skin-derived precursors from neonatal BALB/c mice were isolated , identified and intradermally transplanted with a PKH26 label to track their survival. These were then injected at different concentrations into the buttock dermis of nude mice at 2-weekly intervals before UV irradiation. Photographs , assessment of live skin surface , histology with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the impact of SKP on wrinkles and other relevant indicators of skin photoaging. SKP exhibited a sphere-like structure and could survive for at least 2 weeks after intradermal transplantation. A large dose of SKP transplantation ( 10 We found that transplanted SKP exert a beneficial impact on preventing UV-induced wrinkles in vivo , suggesting that SKP transplantation is a promising candidate for preventing photoaging.
