 A rapid , highly sensitive and roubst spectrofluorimetric method was developed for trace analysis of silymarin ( SLM) in active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API) , pharmaceutical preparations and human plasma. The proposed method is based on reaction of SLM with a novel reagent; 3-amino-5-pyridin-3-yl-1,2,4-triazole ( 3-APT); in the presence of 0.04 M sodium hydroxide. The formed fluorescent product was formed within 5 min and was measured at 504 nm after excitation at 390 nm. All reaction parameters were optimized and the proposed method was validated according to ICH guidelines. The developed method was linearly correlated at the concentration range of 0.05-8 Î¼g mL
