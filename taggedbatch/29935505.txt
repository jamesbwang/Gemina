 We investigate the energetics of droplets sourced by the thermal fluctuations in a system undergoing a first-order transition. In particular , we confine our studies to two dimensions with explicit calculations in the plane and on the sphere. Using an isoperimetric inequality from the differential geometry literature and a theorem on the inequality 's saturation , we show how geometry informs the critical droplet size and shape. This inequality establishes a `` mean field '' result for nucleated droplets. We then study the effects of fluctuations on the interfaces of droplets in two dimensions , treating the droplet interface as a fluctuating line. We emphasize that care is needed in deriving the line curvature energy from the Landau-Ginzburg energy functional and in interpreting the scalings of the nucleation rate with the size of the droplet. We end with a comparison of nucleation in the plane and on a sphere.
