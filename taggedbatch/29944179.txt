 Through a mutualistic relationship with woody plant roots , ectomycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> provide growth-limiting nutrients , including inorganic phosphate ( Pi) , to their host. Reciprocal trades occur at the Hartig net , which is the symbiotic interface of ectomycorrhizas where the two partners are symplasmically isolated. Fungal Pi must be exported to the symbiotic interface , but the proteins facilitating this transfer are unknown. In the present study , we combined transcriptomic , microscopy , whole plant physiology , X-ray fluorescence mapping ,
