 We propose an optimized single-step assay of total nitrite and nitrate concentrations based on serum deproteinization by ultrafiltration. After deproteinization , the residual protein concentration was 0.0800 Â± 0.0007 mg/ml , which secured necessary transparency of the specimens in contrast to methanol deproteinization. The optimized assay for serum nitrite and nitrate ions is characterized by high reproducibility and accuracy ( variation coefficient < 7 %) and can be recommended for routine use in clinical practice.
