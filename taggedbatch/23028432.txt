 We sequenced the genome of Raoultella<pathogen> ornithinolytica<pathogen> strain Marseille-P1025 that caused a rare case of prosthetic joint infection in a 67-year-old immunocompetent male. The 6.7-Mb genome exhibited a genomic island<disease> ( RoGI) that was unique among R.<pathogen> ornithinolytica<pathogen> strains. RoGI was likely acquired by lateral gene transfer from a member of the Pectobacterium genus and coded for a type IVa secretion system found in other pathogenic bacteria and that may have conferred strain Marseille-P1025 an increased virulence. Strain Marseille-P1025 was also able to infect , multiply within , and kill Acanthamoaeba castellanii<pathogen> amoebae.
