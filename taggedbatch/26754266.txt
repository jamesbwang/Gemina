 When analyzing complex longitudinal data , especially data from different educational settings , researchers generally focus only on the mean part ( i.e. , the regression coefficients) , ignoring the equally important random part ( i.e. , the random effect variances) of the model. By using Project English Language and Literacy Acquisition ( ELLA) data , we demonstrated the importance of taking the complex data structure into account by carefully specifying the random part of the model , showing that not only can it affect the variance estimates , the standard errors , and the tests of significance of the regression coefficients , it also can offer different perspectives of the data , such as information related to the developmental process. We used xxM ( Mehta , 2013) , which can flexibly estimate different grade-level variances separately and the potential carryover effect from each grade factor to the later time measures. Implications of the findings and limitations of the study are discussed.
