 Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD) is an X-linked disorder characterized by progressive<symptom> muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> and multisystem involvement. Recent advances in management of individuals with DMD have prolonged survival. Lack of standardized care spurred an international collaboration to develop consensus-based care considerations for diagnosis and management. In this study , we evaluate adherence to considerations at selected sites. We collaborated with the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance , Tracking , and Research Network. Our sample included males with DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy < 21 years as of December 31 , 2010 , with 1 health care encounter on or after January 1 , 2012. We collected data from medical records on encounters occurring January 1 , 2012 , through December 31 , 2014. Adherence was determined when frequency of visits or assessments were at or above recommendations for selected care considerations. Our analytic sample included 299 individuals , 7 % of whom ( 20/299) were classified as childhood-onset Becker muscular dystrophy. Adherence for neuromuscular and respiratory clinician visits was 65 % for the cohort; neuromuscular assessments and corticosteroid side effect monitoring measures ranged from 16 % to 68 %. Adherence was 83 % for forced vital capacity and â‰¤ 58 % for other respiratory diagnostics. Cardiologist assessments and echocardiograms were found for at least 84 %. Transition planning for education or health care was documented for 31 % of eligible males. Medical records data were used to identify areas in which practice aligns with the care considerations. However , there remains inconsistency across domains and insufficiency in critical areas. More research is needed to explain this variability and identify reliable methods to measure outcomes.
