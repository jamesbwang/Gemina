 Ubiquitous expression of CD19 on B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma identified it as a potential target for immune-based therapies. Areas covered: This article reviews the current literature on anti-CD19 therapies currently in clinical trials including monoclonal antibodies ( mAb) , antibody targeted cytotoxic drug conjugates ( ADC) , bispecific antibodies , and chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) modified T cells. Expert opinion: Naked anti-CD19 mAbs have shown little clinical benefit in B cell lymphomas. Despite unusual toxicity profiles with many anti-CD19 ADCs slowing development , durable remissions in a substantial minority of patients with refractory aggressive lymphomas should encourage continued efforts in this area. Blinatumomab , an anti-CD19 bispecific T cell engager , has shown impressive responses in relapse/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL) , but is plagued by neurotoxicity issues and the need for continuous infusion. CD19 targeting CAR-T cell therapies are the most promising , with the potential for curing a third of refractory DLBCL patients. There is still much work to be done to address potentially life-threatening cytokine release syndrome<disease><symptom> and neurotoxicity , an extended production time precluding patients with rapidly progressive disease , and treatment expense. However , if the promise of CAR-T cell technology is confirmed , this will likely change the approach and prognosis for relapse/refractory aggressive lymphoma.
