 To report an unusual case of bilateral recurrent full-thickness macular holes ( FTMH) in both eyes of a single patient over a 15-year period , with a total of 3 FTMH in the right eye and 2 in the left eye. Each FTMH was successfully treated with vitreous surgery , resulting in hole closure and visual acuity improvement. During the previous 15 years , a 59-year-old female developed a total of 3 FTMH in the right eye and 2 FTMH in the left eye. The initial FTMH in each eye was surgically closed with pars plana vitrectomy ( PPV) , epiretinal membrane ( ERM) peeling , 14 % C This case illustrates that a rare individual may have more than one recurrent FTMH in both eyes. Final visual outcome can be favorable following closure of more than one recurrent FTMH.
