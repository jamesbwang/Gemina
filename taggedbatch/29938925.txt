 In `` CD4 + and B lymphocyte<symptom> expression quantitative traits at rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> risk loci in untreated early arthritis<disease><symptom>: implications for causal gene identification , '' Thalayasingam et al ( 1) reported that the 6p23 locus , associated with rheumatoid arthritis<disease><symptom> ( RA) , has a B cell-specific eQTL effect on CD83. The B cell-specific eQTL effect at this locus is robust and has also been reported in other studies ( 2) , and this locus presumably contributes to the pathogenesis of RA by decreasing the expression of CD83 on B cells. Here , we sought to determine the basis for the B cell-specific eQTL effect and the mechanism by which this eQTL effect contributes to the pathogenesis of RA.Publicly available epigenomic data showed that the RA GWAS lead SNP , rs12529514 ( 3) , resides near a DNase hypersensitivity<disease> site in B cells ( 4) ( Figure 1A).
