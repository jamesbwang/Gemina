 Current clinical risk assessment strategies have poor accuracy for identifying patients who will suffer adverse perioperative events. There is an ongoing need to integrate clinical variables with novel technology and biomarkers to accurately predict outcome after pediatric heart surgery. We tested the hypothesis that miRNAs-208a , -208 b , and -499 can serve as noninvasive biomarkers for the extent of myocardial damage and the postoperative clinical course of pediatric patients with congenital heart defects ( CHDs) at an early time point following surgery. Serum samples were obtained from 79 pediatric patients before and 6 , 12 , and 24 h after surgery. MiRNAs-208a , -208 b , and -499 were quantified by RQ-PCR. Correlations between the patient 's clinical variables and miRNA levels were tested. Our results show that the levels of the three miRNAs were elevated at 6 h after surgery , remained high at 12 h and declined at 24 h after the operation. The amount of all three miRNAs at 6 h after surgery correlated with surgical and laboratory parameters. Their amount at 12 h after surgery correlated with the length of stay at the hospital. Expression levels of miRNA-208a at 6 h were related to the appearance of cardiac complications , and could predict whether a patient will sustain complications or will be ventilated for more than 48 h after surgery. Circulating miRNA-208a is a predictor for the risk of developing cardiac complications during the postoperative course as early as 6 h after heart surgery for CHD in pediatric patients.
