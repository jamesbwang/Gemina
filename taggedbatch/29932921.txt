 Emerging evidence has shown that microRNAs ( miRNAs) play a mediatory role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy ( DN) , but the function of the involved miRNAs is still incomplete. Here , we found that miR-455-3p was down-regulated in the human mesangial cells ( HMC) and human proximal tubule epithelial cells ( HK-2) stimulated with high glucose ( HG) or transforming growth factor beta 1 ( TGF-β1). Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase 2 ( ROCK2) was identified as a directed target of miR-455-3p. Overexpression of ROCK2 significantly attenuated the inhibitory effects of miR-455-3p on cell proliferation , extracellular matrix ( ECM) synthesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) in HG-treated cells. Furthermore , the DN model was prepared by using high-fat feeding combined with Streptozotocin ( STZ) induced rats , and the DN group was treated by injecting miR-455-3p agomir. The results of periodic acid-Schiff ( PAS) and Masson staining showed that miR-455-3p overexpression improved the pathological changes of glomerular hypertrophy , mesangial amplification , and renal fibrosis<disease>. Additionally , miR-455-3p overexpression decreased ROCK2 , proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA) and Collagen I levels , and also reduced inflammatory cytokines TNF-α , MCP-1 and IL-1β levels in vivo. Altogether , these results suggest that miR-455-3p plays an essential role in the treatment of renal fibrosis<disease> through repressing ROCK2 expression; and miR-455-3p might be an effective therapy for DN.
