 To report on a clinical and genetic investigation of a large , multigenerational South African family of mixed ancestry with autosomal dominant congenital cataracts , coloboma , and nystagmus<symptom>. Ophthalmic examination was performed in 27 individuals from the same admixed South African family. DNA was sampled from either peripheral blood or buccal swabs in all 27 individuals , and whole genome sequencing was performed in six individuals. Sanger sequencing was used to validate the probable mutation in the remaining family members. Twenty-seven family members with 19 affected individuals were included in the study. The predominant phenotype , with highly variable expression , was congenital cataract ( 14 individuals) , posterior segment coloboma ( 17 individuals) , and nystagmus<symptom> ( 18 individuals). Other features present included high myopia , microcornea , and strabismus. An R208W mutation in None
