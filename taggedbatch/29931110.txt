 Some studies have demonstrated an association between poor continuity of care , high likelihood of ` inappropriate ' use of emergency departments ( EDs) and avoidable hospitalization. However , we lack data concerning primary care use after an ED visit. Identify the determinants of a visit to the general practitioner ( GP) after an ED visit. Observational study ( single-centre cohort). One emergency department in Paris , France. All adult patients who presented at the ED and were discharged. We collected data by the use of a standardized questionnaire , patients ' medical records and a telephonic follow-up. Descriptive analyses were performed to compare individuals with and without a GP. Then , for those with a GP , multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the determinants of the GP consultation. We included 243 patients ( mean age 45 years ( Â± 19)); 211 ( 87 %) reported having a GP. Among those who reported having a GP , 52 % had consulted their GP after the ED visit. Not having a GP was associated with young age , not having complementary health insurance coverage , and being single. GP consultation was associated with increasing age ( adjusted odds ratios ( aOR) = 1.03) , poor self-reported health status ( aOR = 2.25) , medical complaints versus traumatic injuries ( aOR = 2.24) and prescription for sick note ( aOR = 5.74). Not having a GP was associated with factors of social vulnerability such as not having complementary health insurance coverage. For patients with a GP , consultation in the month after an ED visit seems appropriate , because it was associated with poor health status and medical complaints.
