 Phloem failure has recently been recognized as one of the mechanisms causing tree mortality under drought , though direct evidence is still lacking. We combined 13C pulse-labelling of 8-year-old beech trees ( Fagus sylvatica L.) growing outdoors in a nursery with an anatomical study of the phloem tissue in their stems to examine how drought alters carbon transport and phloem transport capacity. For the six trees under drought , predawn leaf water potential ranged from -0.7 to -2.4 MPa , compared with an average of -0.2 MPa in five control trees with no water stress. We also observed a longer residence time of excess 13C in the foliage and the phloem sap in trees under drought compared with controls. Compared with controls , excess 13C in trunk respiration<symptom> peaked later in trees under moderate drought conditions and showed no decline even after 4 days under more severe drought conditions. We estimated higher phloem sap viscosity in trees under drought. We also observed much smaller sieve-tube radii in all drought-stressed trees , which led to lower sieve-tube conductivity and lower phloem conductance in the tree stem. We concluded that prolonged drought affected phloem transport capacity through a change in anatomy and that the slowdown of phloem transport under drought likely resulted from a reduced driving force due to lower hydrostatic pressure between the source and sink organs.
