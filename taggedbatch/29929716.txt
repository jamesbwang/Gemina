 Obese patients have increased rates of upper extremity injury , carpal tunnel syndrome<disease><symptom> , and upper extremity osteoarthritis. Preoperative considerations include cardiovascular disease , pulmonary disease , and diabetes mellitus. Intraoperative and anesthetic considerations include specialized equipment , patient positioning , and the physiology of obese patients. Postoperative considerations should include increased risk of cardiovascular complications as well as surgical<disease> site<disease> infections<disease> and malunion. Surgery of the hand and upper extremity may be less prone to the postoperative complications seen in other regions of the body.
