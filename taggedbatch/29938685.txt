 Visualization of viruses in the host cell during the course of infection by correlative light-electron microscopy ( CLEM) requires a specific labelling of the viral structures in order to recognize the nanometric viral cores in the intracellular environment. For Human<pathogen><disease> immunodeficiency<pathogen><disease> virus<pathogen> type 1 ( HIV-1) , the labelling approaches developed for fluorescence microscopy are generally not suited for transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) , so that imaging of HIV-1 particles in infected cells by CLEM is not straightforward. Herein , we adapt the labeling approach with a tetracystein tag ( TC) and a biarsenical resorufin-based label ( ReAsH) for monitoring the HIV-1 particles during the early stages of HIV-1 infection by CLEM. In this approach , the ReAsH fluorophore triggers the photo-conversion of 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride ( DAB) , generating a precipitate sensitive to osmium tetroxide staining that can be visualized by transmission electron microscopy. The TC tag is fused to the nucleocapsid protein NCp7 , a nucleic acid chaperone that binds to the viral genome. HeLa cells , infected by ReAsH-labeled pseudoviruses containg NCp7-TC proteins exhibit strong fluorescent cytoplasmic spots that overlap with dark precipitates in the TEM sections. The DAB precipitates corresponding to single viral cores are observed all over the cytoplasm , and notably near microtubules and nuclear pores. This work describes for the first time a specific contrast given by HIV-1 viral proteins in TEM images and opens new perspectives for the use of CLEM to monitor the intracellular traffic of viral complexes.
