 Patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis ( PC) of gastric origin have a poor prognosis of life with an average survival of 1-3 months. Systemic chemotherapy has improved the survival of those patients with gastric metastatic cancer at 7-10 months. However , this benefit could not be reproduced in those patients with PC. The current literature for the use of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC) for gastric PC has significant variation related to patient selection , treatment intent ( palliative vs. attempt at curative treatment) , surgical technique , intraperitoneal chemotherapy agent utilized , and systemic chemotherapy administered adjuvantly. From the perspective of patient selection for cytoreduction and HIPEC , patients with extensive PC are not candidates. In addition , unresectable location would make a patient a poor candidate for cytoreduction and HIPEC. Optimally , those with positive peritoneal cytology alone could benefit most. However , the role of cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC in patients with PC of gastric origin has not yet been clarified.
