 The rise in obesity prevalence worldwide has presented problems for practitioners treating patients in the ambulatory setting. As more procedures are being performed in office based suites , anesthesiologists are being asked to provide more anesthesia services for obese patients that may compromise safety. Conventional wisdom associates a higher bodymass index ( BMI) with the potential for more adverse outcomes. When combined with the limited resources available in officebased anesthesia ( OBA) locations , this prompts anesthesiologists to consider placing limits on BMI. However , not every OBA location is similar , thus contributing to the difficulty in establishing consensus BMI limits. Here , we review literature addressing obesity in ambulatory surgery and point out concerns that anesthesiologists should consider when treating obese patients in an OBA setting.
