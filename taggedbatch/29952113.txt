 This is the first study to investigate the therapeutic effects of Cordyceps<pathogen> cicadae ( C. cicadae) mycelia as well as its active compound N Forty 9-week-old mice were divided into normal control , diabetic control group and three C. cicadae mycelia treated diabetic groups. After nine weeks of continuous supplementation , oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT) and homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance index showed significant glucose tolerance with C. cicadae mycelia. Furthermore , the effect of HEA is similar to that of C. cicadae mycelia in an OGTT , suggesting that HEA could be the major factor responsible for the functional properties of C. cicadae mycelia. Based on these findings , it is suggested that the therapeutic effect of C. cicadae mycelia is may be driven by one of its active components , HEA , which could alleviate many diabetes complications in genetically obese mice and may offer promise as a supplement for diabetes management.
