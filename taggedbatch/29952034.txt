 Recently , commercial graphite and other carbon-based materials have shown promising properties as the anode for potassium-ion batteries. A fundamental problem related to those carbon electrodes , significant volume expansion , and structural instability/collapsing caused by cyclic K-ion intercalation , remains unsolved and severely limits further development and applications of K-ion batteries. Here , a multiwalled hierarchical carbon nanotube ( HCNT) is reported to address the issue , and a reversible specific capacity of 232 mAh g
