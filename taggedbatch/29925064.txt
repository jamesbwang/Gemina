 To determine the optimal dose of LB03002 , a sustained-release , once-weekly formulation of recombinant human growth hormone ( rhGH) , and to compare its efficacy and safety with daily rhGH in children with idiopathic short stature ( ISS). This multicenter , randomized , open-label , phase II study included GH-na√Øve , prepubertal children with ISS , randomized to receive daily rhGH 0.37 mg/kg/week ( control , n = 16) , LB03002 0.5 mg/kg/week ( n = 14) , or LB03002 0.7 mg/kg/week ( n = 16). The primary endpoint was height velocity ( HV) change at week 26. At week 26 , the least square ( LS) means for HV change ( cm/year) with control , LB03002 0.5 mg/kg/week , and LB03002 0.7 mg/kg/week were 5.08 , 3.65 , and 4.38 , and the LS means for the change in height standard deviation score were 0.65 , 0.49 , and 0.58 , respectively. The lower bound of the 90 % confidence interval for the difference between LB03002 0.7 mg/kg/week and the control in the LS mean for HV change ( -1.72) satisfied the noninferiority margin ( -1.75). Adverse events were generally mild and short-lived. A once-weekly regimen of LB03002 0.7 mg/kg demonstrated noninferiority to the daily regimen of rhGH 0.37 mg/kg/week in terms of HV increments. LB03002 was well tolerated and its safety profile was comparable with that of daily rhGH.
