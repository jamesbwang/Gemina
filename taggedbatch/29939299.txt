 Age is the most prominent risk factor for the development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. The present study investigated the role of CX3CL1-CX3CR1 signaling in age-related differences in surgery-induced cognitive deficits and neuroinflammation. Adult<disease> and aged male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to partial hepatectomy or partial hepatectomy with intracerebroventricular infusion of CX3CL1. On postoperative days 3 , 7 , and 14 , the rats were subjected to an open field test and the Morris water maze test. Hippocampal interleukin-1Î² , CX3CL1 , CX3CR1 , brain derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) , ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 ( Iba-1) , and Arginase-1 ( Arg1) levels were measured. Age exacerbated cognitive impairment and increased neuroinflammation following surgery. Surgery-induced decreases in CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 proteins were accompanied by increased microglial activation , as indicated by increased Iba-1 expression. Corresponding decline in Arg1 and BDNF levels were observed. Treatment with CX3CL1 decreased proinflammatory cytokines expression , increased BDNF and Arg1 levels in the brain , and enhanced behavioral recovery. The surgery-induced decreases in CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 expression exacerbated postoperative cognitive deficits and exaggerated neuroinflammatory responses in this rodent model. Treatment with CX3CL1 attenuated these effects , at least partly by inhibiting microglial activation , decreasing the associated production of proinflammatory cytokines , and enhancing BDNF expression.
