 The cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality in end-stage renal disease ( ESRD) patients. However , roles of statins are still controversial in dialysis-dependent ESRD patients regardless of having proven coronary artery occlusive disease. The aim of this study was to examine the benefit of statin following percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) in ESRD patients who have proven coronary artery occlusive disease. This study was based on the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort in South Korea. We included 150 ESRD patients on chronic hemodialysis who underwent PCI with stenting between 2002 and 2013. The primary outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction , stroke , and all-cause mortality. Multivariate time-dependent Cox regression analysis were performed , and statin therapy after PCI was treated as a time-dependent variable. During 3.15 ± 2.71 ( mean ± standard deviation) years of follow-up , there were 82 patients with primary outcome. The adjusted hazard ratio for statin use was 0.54 ( 0.33-0.90) compared to no statin use. This study showed that statin has significant benefit on reducing adverse events risk in dialysis-dependent ESRD patients after PCI.
