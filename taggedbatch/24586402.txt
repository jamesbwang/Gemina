 Since human Nucleoside Transporters ( hNTs) were identified by their activity as transport systems , extensive work has been done to fully characterize them at the molecular and physiological level. Many efforts have been addressed to the identification of their selectivity for natural substrates and nucleoside analogs used to treat several diseases. hNTs belong to two different gene families ,
