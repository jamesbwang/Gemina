 While glucocorticosteroids ( GCS) are widely used in patients with kidney disease , little is known about their effect on serum creatinine , the most commonly used endogenous marker of kidney function. We assessed the effect of GCS on the relationship between estimated GFR using the Schwartz equation ( eGFR) and measured GFR using a single-injection inulin clearance ( Cin) in children both in a paired analysis and a cross-sectional study. Primary outcome variable was the difference between eGFR and Cin ( ΔGFR) in a paired analysis involving 22 patients during and off GCS treatment ( mean GFR 103.8 ml/min/1 .73 m The paired analysis showed no significant difference in ΔGFR with or without GCS (- 23 ( SD 53) vs.- 9 ( SD 41) ml/min/1 .73 m GCS use had no significant effect on serum creatinine as a marker for kidney function in a mixed population of renal outpatient clinic children.
