 Some studies , mainly in Europe , have shown a low level of sensitization to house dust mite ( HDM) allergens at high altitude ( HA). Differently , some others in tropical countries have shown a higher level. The aim of this study was to evaluate allergens sensitization , including HDM , in children with severe asthma ( SA) , residents at HA in a tropical middle-income developing country. Observational , analytical , cross-sectional study in children aged 6-15 years old with SA at HA ( 2640 m). Skin prick tests ( SPT) , serum IgE , exhaled fraction of nitric oxide ( FE We included 61 children. Most patients were male ( 61.3 %) , median age: 10 years ( Interquartile range ( IQR): 8-12) , median BMI: 17 kg/m These children with SA living at HA in a tropical middle-income developing country have a high prevalence of HDM sensitization. One explanation for this might be that tropical conditions , such as temperature and humidity , could modify the effect of the altitude on asthma.
