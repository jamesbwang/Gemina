 Amphotericin B ( AmB) is an antifungal drug used for serious fungal infections and leishmaniosis. However , its clinical application is limited because of its high toxicity. To resolve this problem , herein we loaded AmB into methoxy poly ( ethylene glycol)- b-poly ( l-glutamic acid-co-l-phenylalanine) ( mPEG-b-P ( Glu-co-Phe)) nanoparticles ( l-AmB) via electrostatic , hydrophobic and π-π interactions. The l-AmB has excellent stability both in PBS and in plasma and shows a remarkably reduced hemolysis<symptom> ( 17.1 ± 1.5 % , 6 h) compared to the free AmB ( 94.2 ± 5.3 % , 6 h). The nephrotoxicity of l-AmB is significantly lower than that of free AmB. The maximum tolerance dose ( MTD) of l-AmB is 3.0 mg kg-1 , which is 3.75 fold that of free AmB ( MTD = 0.8 mg kg-1). The antimicrobial activity of the conjugate was retained in vivo , with l-AmB proving to be a more protective treatment for Aspergillus<pathogen> fumigatus<pathogen> infections in mice than AmB alone. These indicate that l-AmB is a formulation of AmB with low side effects.
