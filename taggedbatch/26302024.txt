 Alcoholic liver disease ( ALD) remains to be a worldwide health problem. It is generally accepted that oxidative stress plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of ALD , and antioxidant therapy represents a logical strategy for the prevention and treatment of ALD. Nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 ( NFE2L2 or Nrf-2) is essential for the antioxidant responsive element ( ARE)- mediated induction of endogenous antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase 1 ( HO-1) and glutamate-cysteine ligase ( GCL , the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of glutathione ( GSH)). Activation of Nrf-2 pathway by genetic manipulation or pharmacological agents has been demonstrated to provide protection against ALD , which suggests that targeting Nrf-2 may be a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of ALD. Herein , we review the relevant literature about the potential hepatoprotective roles of Nrf-2 activation against ALD.
