 Perianal fistulizing Crohn 's disease is a challenging clinical situation that requires proper management. Some features seen on the endoanal ultrasound can be helpful in discriminating between cryptoglandular and Crohn 's disease fistulas<disease>. The aim of this study was to define the diagnostic accuracy of 3-dimensional endoanal ultrasound in differentiating between Crohn 's disease and cryptogenic fistulas<disease>. This was a prospective observational study. The study was conducted in the colorectal unit of an IBD referral center. Consecutive patients referred for suspected perianal sepsis<disease> from September 2015 to December 2016 were included. Three-dimensional endoanal ultrasonography was the studied intervention. Sensitivity , specificity , and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 4 ultrasonographic features ( Crohn 's ultrasound fistula<disease> sign , the presence of a double track , debris or an abscess<symptom> within the fistula<disease> track , and the maximum width of the track) in discriminating between cryptoglandular and Crohn 's disease fistulas<disease> were calculated. The interobserver agreement for each feature was quantified. In this study , 158 patients , of whom 33 had a diagnosis of Crohn 's disease , were included. The interobserver agreement was good for all of the ultrasonographic features. All of these features were more frequent in cases of Crohn 's disease fistulas<disease> ( p = 0.0001). The maximum width of the fistula<disease> track was highly accurate for discriminating between cryptogenic and Crohn 's disease fistulas<disease> ( area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.922). The simultaneous presence of 2 features was suggestive of Crohn 's disease fistula<disease>. In particular , the presence of a track width > 4 mm in conjunction with either a double track or the Crohn 's ultrasound fistula<disease> sign showed very high specificity ( 1.00). Conversely , a fistula<disease> track width â‰¤ 3 mm had high sensitivity ( 0.97). Patients included in the cryptogenic group might be diagnosed as having Crohn 's disease at follow-up. The combination of specific endoanal ultrasonographic features allows for highly accurate discrimination between Crohn 's disease and cryptogenic fistulas<disease>.
