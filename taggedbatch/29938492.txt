 Bisphenol A ( BPA) detection has attracted much attention recently for its importance to food safety and environment. The DNA-functionalized solution-gated graphene transistors are integrated in microfluidic systems and used for recycling detections of BPA for the first time. In the presence of BPA , both single- and double-stranded DNA molecules are detached and released from the graphene surface in aqueous solutions , leading to the change of device electrical performance. The channel currents of the devices change monotonically with the concentration of BPA. Moreover , the devices modified with double-stranded DNA are more sensitive to BPA and show the detection limit down to 10 ng/mL. The highly sensitive label-free BPA sensors are expected to be used for convenient BPA detections in many applications.
