 The tailored chemical synthesis of binary and ternary alloy nanoparticles with a uniform elemental composition is presented. Their dual use as magnetic susceptors for induction heating and catalytic agent for steam reforming of methane to produce hydrogen at temperatures near and above 800 °C is demonstrated. The heating and catalytic performance of two chemically synthesized samples of CoNi and Cu ⊂ CoNi are compared and held against a traditional Ni-based reforming catalyst. The structural , magnetic , and catalytic properties of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction , elemental analysis , magnetometry , and reactivity measurements. For induction-heated catalysts , the conversion rate of methane is limited by chemical reactivity , as opposed to the case of traditional externally heated reformers where heat transport limitations are the limiting factor. Catalyst production by the synthetic route allows controlled doping with miniscule concentrations of auxiliary metals.
