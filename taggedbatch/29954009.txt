 Peroneus brevis muscle flap is a distinguished , distally based safe flap that can be manipulated to cover small defects in the leg and ankle. For large-sized defects , a more distal , larger flap is required either locally or distantly. Forty-two distally based peroneus brevis muscle flaps were elevated in 42 patients ( 30 males and 12 females) with major lower leg , ankle , and proximal foot defects of 6 to 15 cm in length and 6 to 12 cm in width. Anatomical findings were recorded as number , size , and sources of blood supply , entry sites , the lowermost two arterial supplies , internal distribution of blood supply to the muscle , the relationship between external and internal distribution of the blood vessels , the length of the muscle , the entry site of the main artery , and the splitting of the proximal portion of the peroneus brevis muscle<symptom> to increase its width to sufficiently cover large defects. The anatomical findings suggested that the muscle can be safely extended to cover a large defect in the leg , ankle , or proximal foot. In addition , the longitudinal splitting of the muscle increases its width by up to three times , making it an excellent long-surviving flap to cover a large defect. A distally based peroneus brevis muscle flap has a rich blood supply and safely reaches the proximal foot , with a secure splitting to cover large defects in the leg , ankle , and proximal foot.
