 Sulphite is commonly used to preserve lamb burger meat in the European Union. Nevertheless , its consumption has been related to certain health problems which have increased consumer demand of free-sulphite products. Natural compounds with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties may be a feasible alternative to preserve lamb burger meat. This study evaluated the antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of carvacrol , green tea and their combination in preserving lamb burger meat. Their effect was also compared with that of 400 ppm sulphite. Lamb burger meat was mixed with different concentrations of the extracts , packaged aerobically and displayed through 8 days at 4 Â°C. Total polyphenols , TBARS , colour , microbial and sensory analyses were performed. Both green tea and carvacrol avoided lipid oxidation even at 300 ppm , while only carvacrol , which showed a concentration-dependent action , delayed discolouration and microbial growth. Carvacrol and green tea also limited the development of oxidation odour and flavour , but the former brought about herbal odours and flavours to the meat. On the other hand , sulphite provided a higher colour stability and lower microbial counts than both natural compounds , but presented a higher lipid oxidation. Carvacrol seems to be a promising alternative to replace sulphite in lamb burger meat while green tea should be combined with an antimicrobial agent. This article is protected by copyright.
