 In the course of restoration of the middle ear , routine histological examinations are initiated in many cases , although a middle ear cholesteatoma can be clinically diagnosed in a normal case. To determine the correlation between the surgeons ' diagnosis and that of the pathologist and comparison with literature data. To check the rate of unexpected diagnoses. Analysis of the costs and survey of German ENT clinics with regard to handling of the histological examination in suspected cholesteatoma. Retrospective evaluation of cholesteatoma cases of the ENT Department of the University Medical Center of Mainz from 2010-2015. Germany-wide postal survey of ENT clinics.

A histological examination was conducted in 78.6 %. For first diagnoses , the sensitivity of the clinical assessment was 97.9 % , specificity 10 % , positive predictive value 96.3 % , and negative predictive value 16.7 %. Recurrences showed values of 100 % , 40 % , 97.1 % and 100 %. Unexpected malignant findings did not occur. This routine histological examination was performed by 58.6 % of German ENT hospitals. A total of 80 % of those questioned this to be useful. A histological examination cost an average of 14.06 $. Intraoperatively , there is a high degree of accuracy in diagnosing cholesteatoma. The cost factor of the histological examination is low and should not be the basis for the decision.
