 In insects , superoxide dismutases ( SODs) play a critical role in the scavenging of harmful reactive oxygen species ( ROS) and protecting against oxidative stress induced by various environmental stresses. The Asiatic rice borer , Chilo suppressalis ( Walker) ( Lepidoptera: Crambidae) , is an economically important insect pest of rice crops. In this study , a mitochondrial manganese SOD ( Cs-mMnSOD) gene was characterized in C. suppressalis. The deduced Cs-mMnSOD protein has typical highly conserved features of mitochondrial manganese SODs , including four manganese binding residues , the signature DVWEHAYY peptide , and a mitochondrial-targeting sequence at the N-terminus. Transcription of Cs-mMnSOD was detectable at all developmental stages , but highest in pupae. Furthermore , the mRNA level of Cs-mMnSOD was strongly upregulated ( more than twofold increase) following exposure to low and high temperatures ( 4 , 30 and 35 °C) , insecticides ( chlorpyrifos and chlorantraniliprole) , and chemical reagents ( cumene hydroperoxide , paraquat , H2O2 and CdCl2) , but slightly elevated ( less than twofold increase) in response to 8 °C , abamectin and CuSO4. Additionally , the Cs-mMnSOD transcription results were consistent with the enzymatic activity data of the protein product. Purified recombinant Cs-mMnSOD protein expressed in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> displayed SOD activity and thermostability. Furthermore , E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> cells overexpressing Cs-mMnSOD exhibited long-term resistance to the oxidative inducers cumene hydroperoxide and paraquat. Our findings indicate that Cs-mMnSOD plays an important role in protecting C. suppressalis against oxidative damage.
