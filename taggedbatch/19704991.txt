 This paper presents a novel manipulation method for micro-objects using acoustically oscillating bubbles with a controllable position based on the gas permeability of polydimethylsiloxane. The oscillating bubble trapped within the side channel attracts the neighboring micro-objects , and the position of the air-liquid interface is controlled by generating temporary pressure difference between the side channel and the air channel. To demonstrate the feasibility of the method in technological applications , polystyrene microparticles of 10
