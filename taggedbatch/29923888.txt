 Recent studies report that a single subtype of α1-adrenergic receptor ( α1-AR) , the α1A-subtype , mediates robust cardioprotective effects in multiple experimental models of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , suggesting that the α1A-subype is a potential therapeutic target for an agonist to treat heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Moreover , we recently found that the α1A-subtype is present in human heart. The goal of this study was to assess the inotropic response mediated by the α1A-subtype in human myocardium , and to determine if the response is down-regulated in myocardium from failing human heart. We measured in-vitro contractile responses of cardiac muscle preparations ( trabeculae) isolated from the right ventricle from non-failing and failing human hearts. Addition of the α1A-subtype agonist A61603 ( 100 nM) resulted in a large positive inotropic response ( force increased ≈ 2-fold). This response represented ≈ 70 % of the response mediated by the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol ( 1 μM). Moreover , in myocardium from failing hearts , α1A-subtype responses remained robust , and only slightly reduced relative to non-failing hearts. We conclude that α1A-subtype-mediated inotropy could represent a significant source of inotropic support in the human heart. Furthermore , the α1A-subtype remains functional in myocardium from failing human hearts and thus , might be a therapeutic target to support cardioprotective effects in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients.
