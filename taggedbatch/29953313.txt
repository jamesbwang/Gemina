 A central goal for reintroduced populations of threatened wood bison ( Bison bison athabascae) is to maintain them free of diseases of concern , particularly bovine tuberculosis<disease> ( caused by Mycobacterium<pathogen><disease> bovis<pathogen>) and brucellosis<disease> ( caused by Brucella<pathogen> abortus<pathogen>). A wood bison population in southwestern Yukon , Canada was reintroduced into the wild in 1988 , but no health assessment has been done since then. To provide an initial assessment of the health status and , hence , the conservation value of this population , we serologically tested 31 wood bison ( approximately 3 % of the population) for pathogens of interest and obtained histopathology results for select tissues. We found no evidence of exposure to M.<pathogen> bovis<pathogen> or Brucella spp. , but antibodies were present to bovine parainfluenza virus 3 , bovine coronavirus<pathogen> , Leptospira<pathogen> interrogans<pathogen> , and Neospora caninum , with seroprevalences of 87 , 7 , 61 , and 7 % of the tested animals , respectively. Reintroduced wood bison in southwestern Yukon may be of high value for wood bison recovery because it is a large and geographically isolated population with no bacteriologic , histopathologic , or serologic evidence of exposure to Brucella spp. or M.<pathogen> bovis<pathogen>.
