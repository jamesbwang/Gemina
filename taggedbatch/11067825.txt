 The size-dependent optical properties of quantum dots ( QDs) are frequently exploited for use in medical imaging and labelling applications. Similarly , presented here , they also elicit profound size-dependent anticoagulant properties. Cadmium telluride quantum dot ( QDs) ( 3.2 nm) were shown to have a dramatic anticoagulant effect centred on around the intrinsic coagulation pathway , compared to their 3.6 nm counterparts. Several clinically relevant diagnostic tests were carried out over a concentration range of the QDs and demonstrated that the 3.2 nm QDs elicited their response on the intrinsic pathway as a whole , yet the activity of the individual intrinsic coagulation factors was not affected. The mechanism appears also to be strongly influenced by the concentration of calcium ions and not cadmium ions leached from the QDs. Static and shear-based primary haemostasis assays were also carried out , demonstrating a profound anticoagulant effect which was independent of platelets and phospholipids. The data presented here suggest that the physical-chemical properties of the QDs may have a role in the modulation of haemostasis and the coagulation cascade , in a yet not fully understood mechanism. This study has implications for the use of similar QDs as diagnostic or therapeutic tools in vivo , and for the occupational health and safety of those working with such materials.
