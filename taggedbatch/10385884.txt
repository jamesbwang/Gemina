 Manganese is a natural contaminant of water sources. It is an essential oligo-element , which may exert toxicity at high doses , particularly via inhalation. Its toxicity by the oral route is less known , but epidemiological and experimental studies tend to support its neurodevelopmental toxicity in infants and children. This paper describes the method used by a middle-size public health institution to derive a Drinking Water Guideline ( DWG) for manganese. After reviewing the work done by major public health institutions , authors confirmed the use of experimental data to derive a point-of-departure ( POD) of 25 mg of manganese/kg/day , based on neurodevelopmental effects on pup rats. Then , a total uncertainty factor of 450 was applied to calculate a Toxicological Reference Value ( TRV) of 55 & micro; g/kg/day. The final DWG proposed for manganese is 60 & micro; g/L and is based on a relative source contribution ( RSC) of water of 20 % and an infant drinking scenario of 182 mL/kg of body<symptom> weight ( BW) of water ( 95th percentile of the ingestion rate distribution for 0 ‚Åª 6 months). Despite its limitations , e.g. , starting with the work done by other agencies , such an approach demonstrates in a transparent way the rationale and challenging choices made by regulators when deriving a DWG.
