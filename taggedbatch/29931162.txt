 Exposure to estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals ( EDCs) during in utero development has been linked to the increasing incidence of disorders of sexual development ( DSDs). Hypospadias , the ectopic placement of the urethra on the ventral aspect of the penis , is one of the most common DSDs affecting men , and can also affect women by resulting in the misplacement of the urethra. This study aimed to comprehensively assess the resulting hypospadias phenotypes in male and female mice exposed in utero from embryonic day 9.5 to 19.5 to the potent estrogenic endocrine disruptor , diethylstilbestrol ( DES) , at a high , clinically relevant dose , and a low , previously untested dose , administered via water. The anogenital distance of male pups was significantly reduced and hypospadias was observed in males at a high frequency. Females exhibited hypospadias and urethral-vaginal fistula<disease>. These results demonstrate the ability of an estrogen receptor agonist to disrupt sexual development in both male and female mice , even at a low dose , administered via drinking water.
