 This study was based on the complex environmental monitoring of the Danube River in Slovakia. Out of 23 monitored sites , three were chosen for the aim of this study. The three sites were sampled regularly three times per year during a 25-year period , which started in 1990 , 2 years before the Gabčíkovo waterworks became operational. Each site represented one of the main potamal types , which we recognised according to the habitat characteristics as eupotamal , parapotamal and plesiopotamal. In order to assess changes which occurred during the 25 years , we studied taxocoenoses of Ephemeroptera , Plecoptera and Trichoptera , which sensitively reflect anthropogenic impacts. The changes caused by the Gabčíkovo waterworks manifested in a decrease of the species diversity in eupotamal because of the disappearance of rheophilous taxa. In the parapotamal and plesiopotamal sites , the initial decrease was followed by a partial recovery of biodiversity due to the artificial floodings. After they were stopped , the decrease occurred again and until 2015 , the insect taxa became rare. Conversely , in the eupotamal site , there was an increasing trend in biodiversity since 2011 until 2015. Overall increase in the floodplain index values indicated a loss of connectivity between the floodplain habitats and their fauna with the main channel during the last 25 years. In this paper , we also extended the floodplain index with data on habitat values and indication weight for several stonefly species.
