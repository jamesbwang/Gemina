 Despite decades of emphasizing the delivery of adolescent preventive care visits and evidence that many preventive services reduce risk , little evidence links preventive visits to increased preventive service delivery. This study examined whether a preventive healthcare visit versus any nonpreventive healthcare visit was associated with higher rates of adolescent and young adult preventive services. Analyzed Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data ( 2013-2015) to determine whether those with a preventive versus nonpreventive healthcare visit had higher rates of past-year preventive services receipt; adolescents ( N = 8,474 , ages 10-17) and young adults ( N = 5,732 , ages 18-25). Bivariable and multivariable analyses adjusting for personal/sociodemographic covariates tested for differences in preventive services rates between preventive versus nonpreventive care groups. Adolescent services were blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , height and weight measured , and all three measured; and guidance given regarding healthy eating , physical activity , seatbelts and helmets , secondhand smoke , dental care , all six topics received , and time alone with provider. Young adult services were blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and cholesterol checked , received influenza<pathogen><disease> immunization , and all three services received. All preventive services rates were significantly higher in those attending preventive visits versus those with nonpreventive visits. Adolescent services increase ranged from 7 % to 19 % and young adults increase from 9 % to 14 % ( all bivariable and multivariable analyses , p < .001). However , most rates were low overall. Higher rates of preventive services associated with preventive visits support its clinical care value. However , low preventive services rates overall highlight necessary increased efforts to promote preventive care and improve the provider delivery of prevention for both age groups.
