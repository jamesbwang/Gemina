 Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy ( PIPAC) is a new tool in the treatment of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. The aerosol containing chemotherapeutic drugs is administered laparoscopically into the abdominal cavity to achieve a local treatment effect. This can be carried out in combination with systemic chemotherapy. Within the framework of a register study , we prospectively documented and evaluated the data of our first 111 PIPAC procedures. The analysis focused on perioperative patient safety and safety at the workplace. Perioperative clinical patient data were analyzed and the platinum concentration in the operating room was checked by wipe samples. A total of 62 patients were scheduled for PIPAC and 121 operations were carried out. In 9 procedures a secure access to the abdomen could not be found and 54 patients received 111 PIPAC treatments. One patient died as a result of intestinal perforation , six bowel lesions<symptom> were treated immediately and healed without further complications. A further patient developed a postoperative renal<symptom> failure<symptom>. Otherwise , there was no major complications and no cases of toxicity. The PIPAC procedure can be used as a supplement to systemic drug treatment for peritoneal carcinomatosis. An exact selection of suitable patients is important. The PIPAC is a low-risk procedure when performed under strict inclusion criteria and under standardized conditions , for the patients and also the surgical staff.
