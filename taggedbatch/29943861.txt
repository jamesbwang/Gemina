 To explore aspects related to the fulfillment of the role of nurses in Palliative Sedation ( PS). PS demands knowledge and a proper attitude for maintaining comfort , preserving dignity and contributing to a peaceful death. In some developed countries , nurses have a well-established role in PS. However , studies on their role and its fulfillment are limited , particularly in the developing world. An exploratory , mixed , qualitative and quantitative study was conducted. A self-administered questionnaire was used to examine the level of knowledge of PS and the level of confidence in skills and knowledge about PS. Also , focus groups were conducted to explore the emotional impact and the perceived role of nurses. Forty-one nurses from three advanced-care hospitals with palliative care units in Colombia completed the questionnaire. Also , 4 focus groups were conducted with 22 participants selected from the first phase. A high level of knowledge regarding PS was found , but the level of confidence in skills was higher than the confidence in knowledge. The participants expressed their belief that their knowledge was derived from experience but believed that it was not enough to fulfill their role with confidence. A negative emotional impact about the patients ' condition was found. For some , it served as motivation to provide better care. For others , it was difficult to face , especially when assisting children. They also expressed satisfaction and gratification about providing relief from suffering through sedation. The role of nursing is essential in PS. Although the nurses ' knowledge is adequate , it primarily derives from experience and not from formal training , which impacts on their perceived confidence and their distress. Formal training for the optimal fulfilling of the nursing role in PS is crucial to provide better end-of-life care , particularly in developing countries. This article is protected by copyright.
