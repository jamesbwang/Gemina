 Despite technological advances , the long-term outcomes of endovascular aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> repair ( EVAR) are still debatable. Although most endograft failures after EVAR can be corrected with endovascular techniques , open conversion may still be required. A 70-year-old male patient presented at the emergency unit with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom>. Twice , in the third and fourth years after the first repair , a stent graft had been placed over a non-adhesive portion of the stent graft due to type Ia endoleaks. In the most recent admission , a CT scan showed type III endoleak and ruptured aneurysm<disease> sac. On this occasion the patient underwent late open conversion. The failure was repaired with total preservation of the main endovascular graft body and interposition of a bifurcated dacron graft. This case demonstrates that lifelong radiographic surveillance should be considered in this subset of patients. Late open conversion following EVAR of ruptured abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysms<disease> can be performed safely.
