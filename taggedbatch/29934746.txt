 Atrazine induces the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , which are detoxified by enzymatic and nonenzymatic mechanisms in plants. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> improve on this first level of plant resistance to environmental stresses through the antioxidant defense system , but the way in which nonenzymatic antioxidants relate to atrazine in arbuscular mycorrhizal roots is not well-known. In this study , a symbiotic relationship between Funneliformis mosseae and Medicago sativa L. roots was established successfully. Then , a non-targeted metabolite analysis which was hypothesis-free concerning particular metabolites was used to provide a comprehensive metabolic fingerprint and to subsequently identify , quantify , and finally find different nonenzymatic antioxidants in mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots following atrazine addition. Tocotrienol , ( iso) flavonoids , and their derivate concentrations in F. mosseae-M. sativa mycorrhizal roots were significantly higher than in non-mycorrhizal roots. The majority of ( iso) flavonoids and their derivates increased significantly via methylation or glycosylation , but dehydroascorbic acid in its oxidized form decreased significantly in mycorrhizal roots. In general , F. mosseae colonization results in significantly greater nonenzymatic antioxidant tocotrienol and ( iso) flavonoids derivate concentrations in M. sativa roots , which may be associated with resistance to atrazine.
