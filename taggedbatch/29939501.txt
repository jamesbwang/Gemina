 To describe participation rates , results , and lessons learned from a lung cancer screening ( LCS) demonstration project. Prospective observational study at 1 of 8 centers participating in a national Veterans Health Administration LCS demonstration project. An electronic health record ( EHR) algorithm and tobacco pack-year ( TPY) information prompt identified patients potentially eligible for LCS. LCS invitation was planned to consist of shared decision-making materials , an invitation letter to call the LCS manager , a reminder letter , and an outreach phone call for nonresponders. The outreach call was subsequently dropped due to time constraints on the LCS manager. Lung nodules<symptom> and incidental findings on LCS low-dose computed tomography ( LDCT) were recorded in templated radiology reports and tracked with EHR notes. Of 6133 potentially eligible patients , we identified 1388 patients with eligible TPY information: 918 were invited for LCS and 178 ( 19 %) completed LCS. LCS completion was more likely in patients in the mailing-plus-call outreach group ( phase I) compared with the mail-only group ( phase II) ( 22 % vs 9 %; P < .001). Among those completing an LDCT , 61 % had lung nodules<symptom> requiring follow-up: 43 % of the nodules<symptom> were less than 4 mm in diameter , 12 patients required further diagnostic evaluation , and 2 had lung malignancies. There were 179 incidental LDCT findings in 116 patients , and 20 % were clinically significant. Important considerations in LCS are accurate identification of eligible patients , balancing invitation approaches with resource constraints , and establishing standardized methods for tracking numerous small lung nodules<symptom> and incidental findings detected by LDCT.
