 It is not easy to design structures with transparent solutions , especially in light projection three-dimensional ( 3D) printing , since the penetration of light in solution is limitless. Here , silk fibroin incorporated with melanin nanoparticles ( SFM) is used as a transparency modifier of poly ( ethylene glycol)- tetraacrylate ( PEG4A) solution. The incorporation of melanin into the SF hydrogel is performed in the range of 0.05-0.2 % ( w/v) , and the SFM was added to the PEG4A precursor solution at 0.25-1.0 % ( w/v). The printing accuracy was examined by comparing the printed and designed feature sizes. The addition of 1.0 % ( w/v) SFM to a 4 % ( w/v) PEG4A ( PEG4A/SFM) precursor solution effectively reduces the transparency of the solution and improves the printing resolution by confining the light beam to a designed region. This enables the fabrication of hard-to-express features such as hollow blood vessels or vacant tubes. Furthermore , the elastic modulus of the printed PEG4A/SFM composite hydrogel increases 2.5-fold higher than the PEG4A hydrogel without SFM. For the bio-ink , PEG4A/SFM-containing cells show non-cytotoxicity and improve the proliferation rate of embedded cells , confirming the high biocompatibility of PEG4A/SFM hydrogels.
