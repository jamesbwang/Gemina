 Acquired docetaxel ( Doc) resistance in hormone-refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC) remains an ongoing clinical challenge , resulting in failed chemotherapy and tumor recurrence. However , the mechanism of Doc-resistance development in prostate cancer cells is still unclear. Here , we observed a subpopulation of prostate cancer cells , in both Doc-resistant cell lines and the tumors of patients with HRPC , which show stem cell markers and greater tumorigenic potential. Those stem-like prostate cancer cells show high expression of ABCB1 , which encodes multidrug resistance-related protein P-glycoprotein , leading to the Doc-resistance in prostate cancer. Moreover , we found that Notch signaling pathway activation in Doc-resistant cell lines and tumor tissues of patients with HRPC correlated with tumorigenicity and the development of Doc resistance. Here , we revealed that a combination of Doc and a Notch signaling inhibitor overcomes Doc resistance and increases the survival of mice with Doc-resistant xenografts. Therefore , targeting the Notch signaling pathway may be a promising strategy to overcome the Doc-resistant cancer in the clinic.
