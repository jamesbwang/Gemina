 Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC) is a metastatic Epstein-Barr<disease> virus ( EBV)- associated cancer that expresses the viral oncogenic protein , latent membrane protein ( LMP) 1. During epithelial metastasis , detached cells must overcome anoikis-induced cell death and , gain the ability to reattach and restore growth potential. Anoikis assays have revealed cell survival mechanisms during suspension but few studies have tracked the fate of cells surviving anoikis-inducing conditions. In this study , a modified anoikis assay was used to examine if the expression of LMP1 confers the recovery of epithelial cells from anoikis. Cells expressing LMP1 mutants and strains were evaluated for distinguishing properties in survival during suspension , reattachment , and outgrowth potential. Expression of LMP1 promoted the outgrowth of the NPC cell line , HK1 , following anoikis induction that was not attributed to enhanced cell survival in suspension or reattachment. The mechanism of LMP1-induced outgrowth required Akt signaling and the conserved PxQxT motif on LMP1 that activates Akt. Deletion of any of the three LMP1 C-terminal activation regions ( CTAR) abrogated anoikis recovery , suggesting that additional LMP1-regulated signaling pathways are likely involved. Of the seven LMP1 strains , only B958 , China1 and Med + promoted HK1 outgrowth from anoikis. This distinguishing biological property segregates LMP1 strains into two categories ( anoikis recovering and non-recovering) and , proposes that LMP1 strain-specific sequences may be important in determining metastatic outgrowth potential in NPC tumors.
