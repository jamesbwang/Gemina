 Sensory suppression is a mechanism that attenuates selective information. As for long-latency suppression in auditory and somatosensory systems , paired-pulse suppression , observed as 2 identical stimuli spaced by approximately 500 ms , is widely known , though its mechanism remains to be elucidated. In the present study , we investigated the relationship between auditory and somatosensory long-latency suppression of change-related cortical responses using magnetoencephalography. Somatosensory change-related responses were evoked by an abrupt increase in stimulus strength in a train of current-constant square wave pulses at 100 Hz to the left median nerve at the wrist. Furthermore , auditory change-related responses were elicited by an increase in sound pressure by 15 dB in a continuous sound<symptom> composed of a train of 25-ms pure tones<symptom>. Binaural stimulation was used in Experiment 1 , while monaural stimulation was used in Experiment 2. For both somatosensory and auditory stimuli , the conditioning and test stimuli were identical , and inserted at 2400 and 3000 ms , respectively. The results showed clear suppression of the test response in the bilateral parisylvian region , but not in the postcentral gyrus of the contralateral hemisphere in the somatosensory system. Similarly , the test response in the bilateral supratemporal plane ( N100m) was suppressed in the auditory system. Furthermore , there was a significant correlation between suppression of right N100m and right parisylvian activity , suggesting that similar mechanisms are involved in both. Finally , a high test-retest reliability for suppression was seen with both modalities. Suppression revealed in the present study is considered to reflect sensory inhibition ability in individual subjects.
