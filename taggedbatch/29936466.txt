 This study aimed to examine the effects of nutritional intervention on the prognosis of patients with cardiopulmonary failure undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO) therapy in Taiwan. An institutional review board-approved retrospective study was conducted on patients receiving ECMO therapy in the intensive care unit of the China Medical University Hospital , Taiwan , from January 2013 to December 2013. The study included 102 patients with cardiopulmonary failure receiving ECMO therapy. The data indicated that higher survival rates were closely related to lower age and APACHE II scores among the patients. In addition , compared to patients who deceased , those who survived had a higher total calorie intake. Most patients could tolerate bolus feeding and polymeric formulas. Furthermore , patients who underwent nutritional therapy with nutritional goals greater than 80 % achieved a better outcome and lower mortality than other patients. Early nutritional intervention could benefit patients undergoing ECMO , and those who reached the delivery goal of 80 % had significantly better outcomes than other patients. Enteral feeding can begin early and was well tolerated by patients receiving ECMO therapy. Following individual nutrition goals is critical for better outcomes , and this analysis might be useful in establishing individualized nutrition goals for oriental population when caring for critically ill patients.
