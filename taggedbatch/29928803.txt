 The overexpression of AXL kinase has been described in many types of cancer. Due to its role in proliferation , survival , migration , and resistance , AXL represents a promising target in the treatment of the disease. In this study we present a novel compound family that successfully targets the AXL kinase. Through optimization and detailed SAR studies we developed low nanomolar inhibitors , and after further biological characterization we identified a potent AXL kinase inhibitor with favorable pharmacokinetic profile. The antitumor activity was determined in xenograft models , and the lead compounds reduced the tumor size by 40 % with no observed toxicity as well as lung metastasis formation by 66 % when compared to vehicle control.
