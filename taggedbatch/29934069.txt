 This study aims to describe cases of traumatic brain injury due to gunshot wounds<disease><symptom> in civilian population over 18 years of age , treated at a referral hospital in Cali , Colombia and compare the clinical outcomes at discharge. An observational , descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted by retrospectively collecting clinical data related to adult patients that presented traumatic brain injury due to civil gunshot-wounds and that consulted to the emergency room at Fundaci√≥n Valle del Lili Hospital in Cali , Colombia between January 2010 and February of 2016. A univariate analysis was performed to determine factors associated with death and adverse clinical outcomes. A total of 95 patients older than 18 years , with traumatic brain injury by gunshot were included in the civil context. The 91.6 % were male. The main context was interpersonal violence with 54.7 %. The most common method of transportation was by ambulance ( 79 %). The Glasgow score at admission was 3-8 in 64.2 % of cases; 9-12 in 6.32 % and 13-15 in 28.4 %. On admission , head CT scan was performed in 82 ( 86.3 %) patients within the first hour , finding a Marshall-Score between I-III in 60.9 % , of IV in 17.8 % of cases and a score between V-VI and in 4.1 %. The trajectory was non-transfixing penetrating in 43.2 % , transfixing in 27.3 % and tangential in 9.5 %. Mortality was 45.3 % in total , 39 % died within the first 24hours. A major compromise on admission determines an overall poorer prognosis and a high likelihood of death in the first 24-hours.
