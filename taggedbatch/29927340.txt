 Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori ( H.<pathogen> pylori) has an essential role in the pathogenesis of gastritis<disease> , peptic ulcer<disease><symptom> disease<disease> , mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and gastric cancer. The severity of the host inflammatory responses against the bacteria have been straightly associated with a special bacterial virulence factor , the cag pathogenicity island<disease> , which is a type IV secretion system ( T4SS) to deliver CagA into the host cells. Besides cag-T4SS , the chromosomes of H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> can encode another three T4SSs , including comB , tfs3 and tfs4. In this review , we systematically reviewed the four T4SSs of H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> and explored their roles in the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal diseases. The information summarized in this review might provide valuable insights into the pathogenic mechanism for H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen>.
