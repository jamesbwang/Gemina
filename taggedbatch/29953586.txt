 Detection of focal cortical dysplasia ( FCD) is of paramount importance in epilepsy presurgical evaluation. Our study aims at utilizing quantitative positron emission tomography ( QPET) analysis to complement magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) postprocessing by a morphometric analysis program ( MAP) to facilitate automated identification of subtle FCD. We retrospectively included a consecutive cohort of surgical patients who had a negative preoperative MRI by radiology report. MAP was performed on T1-weighted volumetric sequence and QPET was performed on PET/computed tomographic data , both with comparison to scanner-specific normal databases. Concordance between MAP and QPET was assessed at a lobar level , and the significance of concordant QPET-MAP A total of 104 patients were included. When QPET thresholds of SD = -1 , -2 , and -3 were used , complete resection of the QPET-MAP Our study demonstrates a practical and effective approach to combine quantitative analyses of functional ( QPET) and structural ( MAP) imaging data to improve identification of subtle epileptic abnormalities. This approach can be readily adopted by epilepsy centers to improve postresective seizure<symptom> outcomes for patients without apparent lesions<symptom> on MRI.
