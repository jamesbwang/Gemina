 The aim of this study was to propose an alternative approach to item response theory ( IRT) in the development of computerized adaptive testing ( CAT) in quality of life ( QoL) for patients with multiple sclerosis ( MS). This approach relied on decision regression trees ( DRTs). A comparison with IRT was undertaken based on precision and validity properties. DRT- and IRT-based CATs were applied on items from a unidi-mensional item bank measuring QoL related to mental health in MS. The DRT-based approach consisted of CAT simulations based on a minsplit parameter that defines the minimal size of nodes in a tree. The IRT-based approach consisted of CAT simulations based on a specified level of measurement precision. The best CAT simulation showed the lowest number of items and the best levels of precision. Validity of the CAT was examined using sociodemographic , clinical and QoL data. CAT simulations were performed using the responses of 1,992 MS patients. The DRT-based CAT algorithm with minsplit = 10 was the most satisfactory model , superior to the best IRT-based CAT algorithm. This CAT administered an average of nine items and showed satisfactory precision indicators ( R = 0.98 , root mean square error ( RMSE) = 0.18). The DRT-based CAT showed convergent validity as its score correlated significantly with other QoL scores and showed satisfactory discriminant validity. We presented a new adaptive testing algorithm based on DRT , which has equivalent level of performance to IRT-based approach. The use of DRT is a natural and intuitive way to develop CAT , and this approach may be an alternative to IRT.
