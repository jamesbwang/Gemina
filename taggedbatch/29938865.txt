 IL-35 modulates immune and inflammatory responses during infections. Here , we investigated IL-35 levels and a single nucleotide polymorphism , rs3761548 , in FOXP3 gene in Helicobacter pylori-infected patients with peptic ulcer<disease><symptom> ( PU) , to clarify possible associations. This study includes 100 H. pylori-infected PU patients , 100 H. pylori-infected asymptomatic subjects ( AS) , and 100 noninfected healthy subjects ( NHSs). Serum IL-35 levels and the genotyping were determined using ELISA and RFLP-PCR methods , respectively. In PU patients , the IL-35 levels were lower than AS and NHS groups ( P < .001). The IL-35 levels in CagA Decreased IL-35 levels could be involved in PU development in H. pylori-infected individuals. IL-35 levels are affected by CagA status of H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> , participants gender , and genetic variations at rs3761548. The AA genotype and A allele at rs3761548 could represent a risk factor for PU development.
