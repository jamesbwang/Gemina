 We consider the set of all initial states within a microcanonical energy shell of an isolated many-body quantum system , which exhibit an arbitrary but fixed nonequilibrium expectation value for some given observable A. On the condition that this set is not too small , it is shown by means of a dynamical typicality approach that most such initial states exhibit thermalization if and only if A satisfies the so-called weak eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( wETH). Here , thermalization means that the expectation value of A spends most of its time close to the microcanonical value after initial transients have died out. The wETH means that , within the energy shell , most eigenstates of the pertinent system Hamiltonian exhibit very similar expectation values of A.
