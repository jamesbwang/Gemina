 To locate the nuclei in hematoxylin-eosin ( HE) stained section images more simply , efficiently and accurately , a new method based on distance estimation is proposed in this paper , which shows a new mind on locating the nuclei from a clump image. Different from the mainstream methods , proposed method avoids the operations of searching the combined singles. It can directly locate the nuclei in a full image. Furthermore , when the distance estimation built on the matrix sequence of distance rough estimating ( MSDRE) is combined with the fact that a center of a convex region must have the farthest distance to the boundary , it can fix the positions of nuclei quickly and precisely. In addition , a high accuracy and efficiency are achieved by this method in experiments , with the precision of 95.26 % and efficiency of 1.54 second per thousand nuclei , which are better than the mainstream methods in recognizing nucleus clump samples. Proposed method increases the efficiency of nuclear location while maintaining the location 's accuracy. This can be helpful for the automatic analysis system of HE images by improving the real-time performance and promoting the application of related researches.
