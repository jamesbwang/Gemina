 Structural and functional abnormalities in the cerebral microvasculature have been observed in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) patients and animal models. One cause of hypoperfusion is the thickening of the cerebrovascular basement membrane ( CVBM) due to increased collagen-IV deposition around capillaries. This study investigated whether these and other alterations in the cerebrovascular system associated with AD can be prevented by long-term dietary supplementation with the antioxidant ubiquinol ( Ub) stabilized with Kaneka QH P30 powder containing ascorbic acid ( ASC) in a mouse model of advanced AD ( 3 × Tg-AD mice , 12 months old). Animals were treated from prodromal stages of disease ( 3 months of age) with standard chow without or with Ub + ASC or ASC-containing vehicle and compared to wild-type ( WT) mice. The number of β-amyloid ( Aβ) plaques in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex was higher in female than in male 3 × Tg-AD mice. Extensive regions of hypoxia were characterized by a higher plaque burden in females only. This was abolished by Ub + ASC and , to a lesser extent , by ASC treatment. Irrespective of Aβ burden , increased collagen-IV deposition in the CVBM was observed in both male and female 3 × Tg-AD mice relative to WT animals; this was also abrogated in Ub + ASC- and ASC-treated mice. The chronic inflammation<symptom> in the hippocampus and oxidative stress in peripheral leukocytes of 3 × Tg-AD mice were likewise reversed by antioxidant treatment. These results provide strong evidence that long-term antioxidant treatment can mitigate plasma oxidative stress , amyloid burden , and hypoxia in the AD brain parenchyma.
