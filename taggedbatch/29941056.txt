 The objective of this study was to provide real-world clinical laboratory-based data to supplement Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) reporting of Q fever<disease><symptom>. We analysed titre results of specimens submitted to a large US clinical laboratory for Coxiella<pathogen> burnetii<pathogen> IgG antibody testing from 2010 through 2016. Presumptive Q fever<disease><symptom> was defined as acute ( phase II IgG titre ⩾ 1:128 , phase I titre < 1:1024) or chronic ( phase I IgG titre ⩾ 1:1024) , based on the results from a single serum specimen. During 2010-2016 , an average of 328 presumptive acute Q fever<disease><symptom> cases were identified at Quest each year , nearly three times the annual average reported to the CDC ( 122). During the same period , the number of chronic cases identified annually at Quest Diagnostics ( 34) was similar to that reported to the CDC ( 29). These findings suggest that CDC data may underestimate the incidence of acute Q fever<disease><symptom>.
