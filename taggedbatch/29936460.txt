 To characterize baby hamster kidney fibroblast ( BHK 21/C13) cells and test the effects of antibodies against podoplanin and disodium cromolyn on BHK 21/C13 cell line-derived tumors grown on chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane ( CAM). BHK 21/C13 cell-derived fibrosarcomas developed in hamsters were implanted on CAM and treated with anti-podoplanin antibodies and disodium cromolyn. BHK 21/C13 cell immunophenotype was assessed. Fibrosarcoma cells were positive for vimentin , CD117 , smooth muscle actin , vascular endothelial growth factor epidermal growth factor receptor , homebox prospero gene 1 and negative for platelet-derived growth factor B , neuron-specific enolase , S100 , CD34 , Ewing sarcoma<disease> and podoplanin. CAM-grown fibrosarcomas were highly sensitive to disodium cromolyn and anti-podoplanin antibodies. Immunophenotyping BHK 21/C13 cells and their response to drugs represent the first step in revealing cell line utility and a reliable tool for experimental cancer research.
