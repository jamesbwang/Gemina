 The goal of this study was to investigate the fatigue<symptom> life , failure modes , and stress distribution of partial ultrafine restorations for posterior teeth in different ceramics. Sixty standard tabletop preparations in epoxy resin G10 received lithium-silicate-based zirconia-reinforced ( ZLS) or hybrid ceramic ( PIC) restorations in 0.5- or 1-mm thickness bonded with resin cement. The same cycling protocol was applied for all specimens , which consisted of 5000 cycles at 200N , followed by 450-N cycles until the specimens ' fracture or the suspension of the test after 1.5 × 10 Zirconium-reinforced lithium silicate restorations with 0.5-mm thickness ( ZLS .5) showed lower fatigue<symptom> strength compared with that of 1.0-mm hybrid ceramic restorations ( PIC1) , and both were similar to other restorations ( PIC .5 and ZLS1) ( log-rank test , χ PIC is more likely to be used in thinner thickness than indicated by the manufacturer , with fatigue<symptom> strength similar to that of thicker ZLS restorations.
