 Pediatric asthma is a common chronic condition that can be exacerbated by environmental exposures , and unconventional natural gas development ( UNGD) has been associated with decreased community air quality. This study aims to quantify the association between UNGD and pediatric asthma hospitalizations. We compare pediatric asthma hospitalizations among zip codes with and without exposure to UNGD between 2003 and 2014 using a difference-in-differences panel analysis. Our UNGD exposure metrics include cumulative and contemporaneous drilling as well as reported air emissions by site. We observed consistently elevated odds of hospitalizations in the top tertile of pediatric patients exposed to unconventional drilling compared with their unexposed peers. During the same quarter a well was drilled , we find a 25 % increase ( 95 % CI: 1.07 , 1.47) in the odds of being hospitalized for asthma. Ever-establishment of an UNGD well within a zip code was associated with a 1.19 ( 95 % CI: 1.04 , 1.36) increased odds of a pediatric asthma hospitalization. Our results further demonstrate that increasing specific air emissions from UNGD sites are associated with increased risks of pediatric asthma hospitalizations ( e.g. 2,2,4-trimethylpentane , formaldehyde , x-hexane). These results hold across multiple age groups and sensitivity analyses. Community-level UNGD exposure metrics were associated with increased odds of pediatric asthma-related hospitalization among young children and adolescents. This study provides evidence that additional regulations may be necessary to protect children 's respiratory health from UNGD activities.
