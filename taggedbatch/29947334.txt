 The accurate determination of the geometrical features of quasi one-dimensional nanostructures is mandatory for reducing errors and improving repeatability in the estimation of a number of geometry-dependent properties in nanotechnology. In this paper a method for the reconstruction of length and spatial orientation of single nanowires ( NWs) is presented. Those quantities are calculated from a sequence of scanning electron microscope ( SEM) images taken at different tilt angles using a simple 3D geometric model. The proposed method is evaluated on a collection of SEM images of single GaAs NWs. It is validated through the reconstruction of known geometric features of a standard reference calibration pattern. An overall uncertainty of about 1 % in the estimated length of the NWs is achieved.
