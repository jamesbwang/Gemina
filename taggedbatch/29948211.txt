 A glycosidase of the basidiomycete Bjerkandera<pathogen> adusta<pathogen> ( BadGluc) was found in screenings to possess a strong decolorizing ability towards malvidin-3-galactoside , an anthocyanin abundant in various berry fruits. The BadGluc was purified from the culture supernatant via FPLC , and the corresponding gene was identified which showed low similarity to other characterized glucosidases. Scanning the primary sequence with PROSITE no active site motif was detected. Eventually , a specific 18 aa consensus pattern was identified manually. The active site motif possessed an undescribed sequence which was only found in a few hypothetical proteins. The corresponding gene was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 yielding activities up to 100 U/L using 4-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside ( pNPG) as substrate. The enzyme possessed a good temperature ( 70 % after 1 h at 50 °C) and pH stability ( 70 % between pH 2 and 7.5) , and preferably catalysed the hydrolysis of delphinidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside , regardless of the position of the terminal Hexa-His tag. This novel glucosidase worked in aqueous solution as well as on pre-stained fabrics making it the first known candidate anthocyanase for applications in the detergent and food industries.
