 Vanishing white matter disease is a heterogeneous disorder caused by mutation in one of the five genes encoding subunits of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2B. It is a heterogeneous disorder due to phenotypic variation and a clear genotype-phenotype correlation could not be established so far. We describe a novel mutation in the EIF2B5 gene by analyzing the clinical phenotype and the progression of brain lesions<symptom> for 10 years. A novel mutation in the EIF2B5 gene was detected in the heterozygous state; c. 1688G > A ( p. Arg563Gln) mutation in exon 12 , accompanied by a previously detected c. 806G > A ( p. Arg269Gln) mutation in exon 6 , leading to substitution of arginine for a glutamine. This compound heterozygous mutation was associated with disease onset at early childhood and relatively slow progression of neurological deterioration. In contrast to previous findings indicated the association of c. 806G > A mutation and peripheral neuropathy in patients with vanishing white matter disease , electromyography of our case was normal. The corpus callosum inner rim was the affected area at early stages , which may be remarkable for early diagnosis of vanishing white matter disease. Serial follow-up magnetic resonance imaging revealed the white matter signal abnormality , subsequently cystic degeneration and decrease in white matter volume. The novel mutation c. 1688G > A in compound heterozygous state leads to intermediate phenotype of the vanishing white matter disease. In the early stages of the disease the signal abnormality in the corpus callosum inner rim might be remarkable.
