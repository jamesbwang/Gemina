 Bacteriophages play an important role in the evolution of bacterial pathogens. A phage-mediated transfer of stx-genes to atypical enteropathogenic E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( aEPEC) which are prevalent in different hosts , would convert them to enterohemorrhagic E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( EHEC). We decided to confirm this hypothesis experimentally to provide conclusive evidence that aEPEC isolated from different mammalian hosts are indeed progenitors of typical EHEC which gain the ability to produce Shiga-Toxin by lysogeny with stx-converting bacteriophages , utilizing the model phage Φ3538 Δstx
