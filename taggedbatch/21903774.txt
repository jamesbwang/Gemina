 Proton pump inhibitors ( PPIs) are metabolized by cytochrome P450. CYP2C19 is the main isoenzyme for the majority of PPI , whereas CYP3A family is a secondary enzyme for PPI biotransformation. The aim of the study was to find if Forty-eight gastric or duodenal ulcer<disease><symptom> patients ( 15 men , 33 women; mean age 55.0 Â± 15.3 years , age range 18-91 years) from Moscow region of Russia were enrolled. Peripheral venous blood was collected for DNA extraction , and real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for We found a connection between In CYP2C19 IMs + PMs , CYP3A activity was significantly lower than in CYP2C19 EMs and UMs.
