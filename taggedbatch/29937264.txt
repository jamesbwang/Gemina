 Anaerobic digestion is important for the management of livestock manure with high ammonia<pathogen> level. Although ammonia<pathogen> effects on anaerobic digestion have been comprehensively studied , the molecular mechanism underlying ammonia<pathogen> inhibition still remains elusive. In this study , based on metatranscriptomic analysis , the transcriptional profile of microbial community in anaerobic digestion under low ( 1500mgL
