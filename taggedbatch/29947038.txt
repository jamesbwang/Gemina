 An anode of self-supported FeP @C nanotube arrays on carbon fabric ( CF) is successfully fabricated via a facile template-based deposition and phosphorization route: first , well-aligned FeOOH nanotube arrays are simply obtained via a solution deposition and in situ etching route with hydrothermally crystallized ( Co , Ni) ( CO
