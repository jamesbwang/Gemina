 Pancreatitis<disease> following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( PEP) is thought to be provoked by pancreatic ductal hypertension , via unknown mechanisms. We investigated the effects of hydrostatic pressures on the development of pancreatitis<disease> in mice. We performed studies with Swiss Webster mice , B6129 mice ( controls) , and B6129 mice with disruption of the protein phosphatase 3 , catalytic subunit , beta isoform gene ( Cnab-/- mice). Acute pancreatitis<disease> was induced in mice by retrograde biliopancreatic ductal or intraductal infusion of saline with a constant hydrostatic pressure while the proximal common bile duct was clamped- these mice were used as a model of PEP. Some mice were given pancreatic infusions of AAV6-NFAT-luciferase , to monitor calcineurin activity or the calcineurin inhibitor FK506. Blood samples and pancreas were collected at 6 and 24 hrs and analyzed by ELISA , histology , immunohistochemistry , or fluorescence microscopy. Ca2 + signaling and mitochondrial permeability were measured in pancreatic acinar cells isolated 15 min after PEP induction. Ca2 +- activated phosphatase calcineurin within the pancreas was tracked in vivo over 24 hrs. Intraductal pressures of up to 130 mmHg were observed in the previously reported model of PEP; we found application of hydrostatic pressures of 100 and 150 mmHg for 10 min consistently induced pancreatitis<disease>. Pancreatic tissues had markers of inflammation<symptom> ( increased levels of interleukin 6 ( IL6) , IL1B , and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)) , activation of STAT3 , increased serum amylase and IL6 , and loss of tight junction integrity. Transiently high pressures dysregulated Ca2 + processing ( reduced Ca2 + oscillations and an increased peak plateau Ca2 + signal) and reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential. We observed activation of pancreatic calcineurin in the pancreas in mice. Cnab-/- mice , which lack the catalytic subunit of calcineurin , and mice given FK506 did not develop pressure-induced pancreatic inflammation<symptom> , edema<symptom> , or loss of tight junction integrity. Transient high ductal pressure produces pancreatic inflammation<symptom> and loss of tight junction integrity in a mouse model of PEP. These processes require calcineurin signaling. Calcineurin inhibitors might be used to prevent acute pancreatitis<disease> that results from obstruction.
