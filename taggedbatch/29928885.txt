 Bromodomain-containing protein 4 ( Brd4) is known to play a key role in tumorigenesis. It binds acetylated histones to regulate the expression of numerous genes. Because of the importance of brd4 in tumorigenesis , much research has been undertaken to develop brd4 inhibitors with therapeutic potential. As a result , various scaffolds for bromodomain inhibitors have been identified. To discover new scaffolds , we performed mid-throughput screening using two different enzyme assays , alpha-screen and ELISA. We found a novel bromodomain inhibitor with a unique scaffold , aristoyagonine. This natural compound showed inhibitory activity in vitro and tumor growth inhibition in a Ty82-xenograft mouse model. In addition , we tested Brd4 inhibitors in gastric cancer cell lines , and found that aristoyagonine exerted cytotoxicity not only in I-BET-762-sensitive cancer cells , but also in I-BET-762-resistant cancer cells. This is the first paper to describe a natural compound as a Brd4 bromodomain inhibitor.
