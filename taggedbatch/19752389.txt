 Chronic total occlusion ( CTO) is common in the presence of other significantly narrowed coronary arteries. The impact of total occlusion and its association with completeness of revascularization on patients with multivessel disease undergoing coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG) remains largely unknown. The aim of our study was to compare CABG operation characteristics , as well as 30-day mortality , incidence of post-operative major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events ( MACCE) between patients with and without CTO in right coronary artery ( RCA). A total of 156 consecutive patients were included in the analysis. CTO of RCA or right posterior descending artery ( RPD) was diagnosed in 57 patients ( CTO-RCA group). Coronary stenosis without CTO in RCA was diagnosed in 99 patients ( nonCTO-RCA group). Baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups. The majority of patients had class II ( 49.1 % vs. 46 % , Chronic total occlusion of RCA was found to be associated with smaller number of grafts performed during the CABG procedure. Although mortality between patients in the CTO-RCA and nonCTO-RCA groups did not differ , patients in the CTO-RCA group had higher incidence of post-operative MACCE.
