 In this study , a plastic microdevice based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification ( LAMP) was fabricated for the amplification and on-chip fluorescence detection of multiple pathogens. Papers infused with LAMP reagents and specific primers were embedded inside the multiple reaction chambers of the microdevice. A solution containing the target pathogens was injected into the sample chamber , located in the center of the microdevice , and evenly distributed to the reaction chambers simultaneously via centrifugal force. For detection , fisetin , a plant-derived fluorophore , was used as the DNA-intercalating dye. Purified DNAs of Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 ( E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7) , Salmonella<pathogen><disease> spp. , Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>) , and Cochlodinium polykrikoides were successfully amplified and directly detected on the microdevice , where as low as 0.13 and 0.12 ng μL-1 of the DNA of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> O157: H7 and S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , respectively , were identified. In addition , the potential of this microdevice for point-of-care testing was further examined by incorporating on-chip sample purification module and testing using a real sample- milk spiked with Salmonella<pathogen><disease> spp.. The thermally lysed milk sample was filtered using polydopamine-coated paper embedded inside a sample chamber and seamlessly transported into the reaction chambers by centrifugal force for subsequent LAMP followed by direct on-chip detection inside the reaction chambers in which fisetin-soaked papers were embedded. The limit of detection for Salmonella<pathogen><disease> spp. was determined to be approximately 1.7 × 102 CFU mL-1 using the microdevice. This microdevice is safe , easy to use , selective , and sensitive enough for point-of-care testing to identify foodborne pathogens as well as environmentally harmful microorganisms.
