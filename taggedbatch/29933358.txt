Effects of active and passive warm-ups on range of motion , strength , and muscle passive properties in ankle plantarflexor muscles. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of active and passive warm-ups on flexibility and strength of calf muscles. Fourteen healthy males ( age: 23.1 ± 2.6 years , height: 172.7 ± 5.6 cm , and body mass: 64.5 ± 7.0 kg) performed 3 types of warm-ups respectively for 10 minutes in a random order: an active warm-up by pedaling a cycling ergometer , an active warm-up doing repeated isometric contractions , and a passive warm-up in a hot water bath. To assess flexibility , range of motion ( ROM) of ankle dorsiflexion , passive torque of ankle plantarflexion , and muscle tendon junction ( MTJ) displacement were measured and then muscle tendon unit ( MTU) stiffness was calculated. After the flexibility assessment , peak torque during maximum voluntary isometric contraction was measured to assess the isometric strength. These data were compared before and after each warm-up. As a result , all 3 types of warm-ups increased ROM ( p < 0.05) and passive torque at terminal ROM ( p < 0.01) , but there were no significant changes in MTU stiffness or MTJ displacement. The active warm-up by pedaling a cycling ergometer increased peak torque during isometric contraction ( p < 0.05) , whereas the other warm-ups did not show significant alterations. In conclusion , the active warm-up with aerobic exercise increased flexibility and strength of the calf muscles.
