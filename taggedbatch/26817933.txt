 Recent studies in the US and abroad suggest that boys are undergoing puberty at a younger age. It is unknown if this secular trend extends to boys with central precocious puberty ( CPP) , who sit at the extreme end of the pubertal spectrum , and if neuroimaging should remain a standard diagnostic tool. Retrospective chart review of all boys with CPP seen by Endocrinology at a US pediatric hospital from 2001-2010. Fifty boys had pubertal onset at an average age of 7.31 years ( 95CI 6.83-7.89) , though many did not present until nearly one year thereafter , by which time 30 % were mid-to-late pubertal. Boys were predominantly non-Hispanic White and 64 % were overweight/obese. The majority ( 64 %) of boys had neurogenic CPP ( CNS-CPP) with neurofibromatosis type I being the most common diagnosis. Diagnosis of CPP led to discovery of a neurogenic lesion<symptom> in only 3 of 32 ( 9 %) CNS-CPP cases. The remaining boys , with idiopathic CPP ( 36 %) , were indistinguishable from those with CNS-CPP aside from four boys who endorsed a family history of PP ( 22 % vs. 0 % among CNS-CPP cases). Importantly , there was no change in the incidence of male CPP after accounting for the increase in clinic volume during this time period. In this contemporary Boston-based cohort of 50 boys with CPP , most cases were neurogenic , consistent with older literature. Several idiopathic cases had a family history of PP but were otherwise indistinguishable from CNS-CPP cases. Thus , neuroimaging remains a critical diagnostic tool. We find no evidence for an increase in the prevalence of male CPP.
