 The aims of this study were to analyze the presence of Streptococcus<pathogen> mutans<pathogen> ( SM)- DNA in cord blood ( CB) , maternal peripheral blood ( PB) , and maternal saliva ( SA) and compare with data collected in health surveys. Sixty-four healthy women with pregnancies to term and without complications attending for elective cesarean section in the Clinical Hospital of Ribeirao Preto , Sao Paulo were included. Samples of PB and unstimulated SA were obtained on the day of hospitalization and samples of CB were collected after the delivery section. Samples were investigated using polymerase chain reaction for the presence of SM-DNA using specific primers. The results show over 50 % of the sample of PB and CB showed SM-DNA detectable. There was a positive correlation between the SM detection in PB/CB and SA ( P < 0.05). Pregnant women , who reported tooth brushing more than three times a day , often showed detectable SM-DNA in PB and CB ( P < 0.05). In conclusion , the majority of children can have contact with SM-DNA during the intrauterine life by the CB. SM probably transferred from salivary habitat to PB and CB. The tooth brushing can be associated to S.<pathogen> mutans<pathogen> detection in blood samples.
