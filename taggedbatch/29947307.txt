 Although the DSM is a widely used diagnostic guide , lengthy criteria sets can be problematic and provide the primary motivation to identify short-forms. Using the 11 diagnostic criteria provided by the DSM-5 for alcohol use disorder ( AUD) , the present study develops a data-driven method to systematically identify subsets and associated cut-offs that yield diagnoses as similar as possible to use all 11 criteria. Relying on data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions ( NESARC-III) , our methodology identifies diagnostic short-forms for AUD by: ( 1) maximizing the association between the sum scores of all 11 criteria with newly constructed subscales from subsets of criteria; ( 2) optimizing the similarity of AUD prevalence between the current DSM-5 rule and newly constructed diagnostic short-forms; ( 3) maximizing sensitivity and specificity of the short-forms against the current DSM-5 rule; and ( 4) minimizing differences in the accuracy of the short-form across chosen covariates. Replication is shown using NESARC-Wave 2. More than 11 000 diagnostic short-forms for DSM-5 AUD can be created and our method narrows down the optimal choices to eight. Results found that ` Neglecting major roles ' and ` Activities given up ' could be dropped with practically no change in who is diagnosed ( specificity = 100 % , sensitivity ⩾ 99.6 %) or the severity of those diagnosed ( κ = 0.97). With a continuous improvement model adopted by the APA for DSM revisions , we offer a data-driven tool ( a SAS Macro) that identifies diagnostic short-forms in a systematic and reproducible way to help advance potential improvements in future DSM revisions.
