 This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on metabolic profiles in diabetic patients with coronary heart disease ( CHD). This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was performed among 60 diabetic patients with CHD , aged 40-85 years at a cardiology clinic in Kashan , Iran , from October 2017 through January 2018. Patients were randomly divided into two groups to take either probiotic supplements ( n = 30) or placebo ( n = 30) for 12 weeks. Fasting blood samples were taken at the beginning of the study and after the 12-week intervention to determine related markers. After 12-week intervention , probiotic supplementation significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose ( Î²- 20.02 mg/dL; 95 % CI- 33.86 ,- 6.17; Overall , we found that probiotic supplementation for 12 weeks had beneficial effects on glycemic control , HDL-cholesterol , total-/ HDL-cholesterol ratio , biomarkers of inflammation<symptom> and oxidative stress in diabetic patients with CHD.
