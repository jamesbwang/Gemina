 The protein kinase Aurora A ( AurA) is essential for the formation of bipolar mitotic spindles in all eukaryotic organisms. During spindle assembly , AurA is activated through two different pathways operating at centrosomes and on spindle microtubules. Recent studies have revealed that these pathways operate quite differently at the molecular level , activating AurA through multifaceted changes to the structure and dynamics of the kinase domain. These advances provide an intimate atomic-level view of the finely tuned regulatory control operating in protein kinases , revealing mechanisms of allosteric cooperativity that provide graded levels of regulatory control , and a previously unanticipated mechanism for kinase activation by phosphorylation on the activation loop. Here , I review these advances in our understanding of AurA function , and discuss their implications for the use of allosteric small molecule inhibitors to address recently discovered roles of AurA in neuroblastoma , prostate cancer and melanoma.
