 To investigate whether liver stiffness measured by acoustic radiation force impulse ( ARFI) sonoelastography always correlates with the liver perfusion parameters quantified by perfusion CT in patients with known liver cirrhosis. Sonoelastography and perfusion CT were performed in 50 patients ( mean age 65.5; range 45-87 years) with liver cirrhosis , who were classified according to Child-Pugh into class A ( 30/50 , 60 %) , B ( 17/50 , 34 %) , and C ( 3/50 , 6 %). For standardized ARFI measurements in the left liver lobe at a depth of 4 cm , a convex 6-MHz probe was used. CT examinations were performed using 80 kV , 100 mAs , and 50 ml of iodinated contrast agent injected at 5 ml/s. Using standardized region-of-interest measurements , we quantified arterial , portal venous , and total liver perfusion. There was a significant linear correlation between tissue stiffness and arterial liver perfusion ( p = 0.015) , and also when limiting the analysis to patients with histology ( p = 0.019). In addition , there was a positive correlation between the total blood supply ( arterial + portal-venous liver perfusion) to the liver and tissue stiffness ( p = 0.001; with histology , p = 0.027). Shear wave velocity increased with higher Child-Pugh stages ( p = 0.013). The degree of tissue stiffness in cirrhotic livers correlates expectedly-even if only moderately-with the magnitude of arterial liver perfusion and total liver perfusion. As such , liver elastography remains the leading imaging tool in assessing liver fibrosis<disease>.
