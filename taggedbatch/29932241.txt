 Proximal migration of colonic lesion<symptom> has been observed; however , risk factors of lesions<symptom> in the proximal colon remain uncertain. This study aimed to investigate risk factors of lesions<symptom> in the proximal colon. Consecutive subjects with complete colonoscopy were included. The primary outcome was risk factors associated with advanced neoplasm ( AN) and serrated lesion<symptom> in the proximal colon. Age , gender , first-degree relative ( FDR) with colorectal cancer ( CRC) , smoking , alcohol consumption , body mass index , hypertension , diabetes , ischemic heart disease , and the use of aspirin , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , and anticoagulants were fitted into a regression model , with reference to subjects without colonic finding. Results were measured by odds ratio ( OR) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI). Among 6218 subjects ( mean age 56.65 ± 6.15 years; 46.8 % male) , 352 ( 5.7 %) had AN; 809 ( 13.0 %) had serrated lesions<symptom> , and 3648 ( 58.7 %) had no colonic finding. There were 148 ( 2.4 %) and 235 ( 3.8 %) subjects having AN and serrated lesion<symptom> in the proximal colon. Age ≥ 50 ( OR: 13.30; 95 % CI: 1.85-95.76) , male gender ( OR: 1.82; 95 % CI: 1.26-2.62) , FDR with CRC ( OR: 2.12; 95 % CI: 1.43-3.15) , and hypertension ( OR: 1.86; 95 % CI: 1.30-2.68) were associated with AN in the proximal colon. Age ≥ 50 ( OR: 5.72; 95 % CI: 2.10-15.53) , male gender ( OR: 1.54; 95 % CI: 1.15-2.05) , and smoking ( OR: 1.85; 95 % CI: 1.23-2.79) increased risk of serrated lesions<symptom> in the proximal colon. Age ≥ 50 and male gender were associated with both proximally located AN and serrated lesion<symptom>; FDR with CRC and hypertension increased the risk of proximal AN , while ever smoking increased the risk of proximal serrated lesion<symptom>. FDR with CRC was not associated with serrated lesion<symptom>.
