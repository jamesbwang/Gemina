 Inappropriate angiogenesis and osteogenesis are considered as the crucial factors of osteoporotic fracture. Hypoxia is a primary driving force for regulating the angiogenic-osteogenic coupling process. Our recent results indicated that hypoxia could improve angiogenesis as well as differentiation and activity of osteoblastic cells via up-regulating VEGF through HIF-1Î± pathway. Here we demonstrated that in human osteoblastic MG-63 , U2-OS and Saos-2 cells , besides VEGF , the other two pro-angiogenic factors IL-6 and IL-8 were also up-regulated by hypoxia and CoCl
