 Traditionally , attention was thought to be directed by either top-down goals or bottom-up salience. Recent studies have shown that the reward history of a stimulus feature also acts as a powerful attentional cue. This is particularly relevant in schizophrenia , which is characterized by motivational and attentional deficits. Here , we examine the impact of reward on selective attention. Forty-eight people with schizophrenia ( PSZ) and 34 non-psychiatric control subject ( NCS) discriminated the location of a target dot appearing inside a left circle or right circle. The circles were different colors , one of which was associated with reward via pre-training. In the first 2 blocks , targets were equally likely to appear in the left or right circle. In the last 4 blocks , the target was 75 % likely on one side , thus allowing us to separately examine how attention was impacted by reward ( color) and probability ( location). PSZ had slower overall reaction times ( RTs) than NCS. Both groups showed robust effects of spatial probability and reward history , with faster RTs for the rewarded color and for the more probable location. These effects were similar in PSZ and NCS. Negative symptom severity correlated with overall RT slowing , but there were no correlations between symptoms and reward-associated biasing of attention. PSZ demonstrated RT slowing but normal reward history and spatial probability-driven RT facilitation. These results are conceptually similar to prior findings showing intact implicit reward effects on response bias , and suggest that implicit processing of reward and probability is intact in PSZ.
