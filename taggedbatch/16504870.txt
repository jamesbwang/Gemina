 To identify the prevalence and clinicopathological profile of calcifying odontogenic cysts<symptom> ( COC) stored at an oral pathology service , and to analyze the immunoexpression of cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX-2) and cyclin D1 ( CD1) in these cysts<symptom>. After a retrospective analysis ( 1990-2016) carried out to identify cases of COC , a sample of 12 cases was selected for immunohistochemical analysis of COX-2 and CD1 by the immunoperoxidase technique. Protein expression was evaluated semiquantitatively by attributing a score of 0 to 3 ( 0 = no staining; 1 = 1-25 %; 2 = 26-50 % , and 3 = > 51 % immunopositive cells). Twenty cases of COC were diagnosed over the study period. These cysts<symptom> were more common in the posterior mandible and in men ( male-to-female ratio of 1.2:1) , with a mean age of 29.9 years. Among the 12 cases analyzed , immunoexpression of COX-2 was observed only in the inflammatory infiltrate in 50 % of the cysts<symptom> ( n = 6). Protein CD1 was detected ( score 1) in 66.6 % of cases ( n = 8) , and COX-2 was negative in 50 % ( n = 6). The prevalence of COC among all odontogenic cysts<symptom> was 3.5 % , representing an uncommon lesion<symptom>. Immunohistochemical analysis suggested that COX-2 does not participate in lesion<symptom> progression. The cell proliferation index of COC was low , as demonstrated by the expression of CD1 , suggesting a proliferative profile compatible with more indolent lesions<symptom>.
