 The paper proposes that frameworks typical to metaphysics and art could be used in clinical treatment in somatic and psychiatric contexts to ensure improved care. The concept of the `` body electric '' of somatic patients which I introduced in previous work is developed further and paired with the `` mind electric '' of psychiatric patients. Both are defined as a patient 's personally generated metaphysical possibility of being healthy-within-illness which is experientially actualized. Both concepts are used here to explore the alternative and the serious challenges to treatment approaches focused on clinical categories , disease , provision , and promotion of standardized or `` black-box '' therapies. An argument against the idea implied by the hope for such mass treatments and corresponding overreliance on science , namely , that health comes from fixing and regularizing , is developed based on cultural history and the evidenced fact that personally assumed health , just like art and metaphysics , is transgressive of scientific data , and accommodates the untrue , the impossible or the irregular as actual and normal. Because normality is created only with the help of disorder and from within it for chronic patients , clinicians should offer them the metaphysical care they need to produce and actualize their possibility of irregular normality or their body/mind electric. Better treatments can only be provided when scientific advances will be matched with advances in the humanistic competence of clinicians.
