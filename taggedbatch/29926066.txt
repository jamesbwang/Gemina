 The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine ( DEX) on neuropathic pain in the chronic compression of dorsal root ganglion ( CCD) rat model and the underlying mechanism. Pain behavioral tests were applied to observe the effects of DEX on mechanical allodynia in Sprague Dawley ( SD) rats. Whole cell patch clamp was used to observe the influence of DEX on excitability and hyperpolarization-activated inward current ( I
