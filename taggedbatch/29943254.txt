 This study investigated the effects of the co-application of Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> and nanohydroxyapatite ( NHAP) on plant growth , soil cadmium ( Cd) dynamics , and the microbiological characteristics ( such as enzyme activity and bacterial species richness) of the rhizosphere soil. Rapeseed was used as a model plant in pot experiments. Different concentrations of B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> and 0.5 % NHAP were applied alone and in combination to Cd-contaminated soil. The Cd contents in soils and plants as well as the rhizospheric microorganism diversity were assessed. The addition of B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> or NHAP alone increased the soil Cd content and decreased the plant Cd content , while their co-application more effectively increased the soil and plant Cd contents than either treatment alone. B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> and NHAP reduced the plant Cd content by 43.15-57.04 % compared with that in the control. Rhizosphere community richness and bacterial diversity were significantly increased after co-application of B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> and NHAP. Co-application of B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> and NHAP effectively promoted rapeseed growth and improved Cd-contaminated soil remediation.
