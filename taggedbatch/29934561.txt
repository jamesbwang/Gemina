 Drug addiction is a worldwide societal problem and public health burden , and results from recreational drug use that develops into a complex brain disorder. The opioid system , one of the first discovered neuropeptide systems in the history of neuroscience , is central to addiction. Recently , opioid receptors have been propelled back on stage by the rising opioid epidemics , revolutions in G protein-coupled receptor research and fascinating developments in basic neuroscience. This Review discusses rapidly advancing research into the role of opioid receptors in addiction , and addresses the key questions of whether we can kill pain without addiction using mu-opioid-receptor-targeting opiates , how mu- and kappa-opioid receptors operate within the neurocircuitry of addiction and whether we can bridge human and animal opioid research in the field of drug abuse.
