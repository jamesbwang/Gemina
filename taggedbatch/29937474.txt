 This study analyzed the trend of construction accidents focused on the small-scale construction sites and the correlation between the ratios of official inspection by government and total fatality injuries per 10,000 people ( TFR) by construction size in Korea. The method is to analyze statistical data for the construction accidents and official safety inspection system. In construction , accidents rate and TFR are recently increasing unlike other industries. In addition , the smaller the scale of construction sites , the higher the TFR , and vice versa. The smaller the scale of construction sites , the greater the degree of difference in the TFR for each year , and vice versa. In small-scale construction sites , which have amounted less than $ 273,000 ( # 231,000) , approximately 45.7 % of deaths occurred on sites between $ 36,400 ( # 30,800) and $ 182,000 ( # 154,000). The ratio of inspection , which represents the ratio of official inspection proportion to site share , is in inverse proportion to the TFR by construction size. As the ratio approached zero , TFR became higher , and the higher the ratio , the lower TFR since the official inspection was mainly carried out in medium and large-scale construction sites. To get an effect of official inspection , the focus of official inspection should move onto the small-scale construction site.
