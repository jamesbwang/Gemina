 Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass and strength produced by aging or secondary to chronic<disease> diseases<disease> such as chronic liver disease ( CLD). Although not all types of sarcopenia involve the same features , the most common are decreased fiber diameter and myosin heavy chain ( MHC) levels , increased activity of ubiquitin-proteasome system ( UPS) and reactive oxygen species ( ROS). In this study , we aim to characterize the development of sarcopenia secondary to CLD induced by the hepatotoxin 5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine ( DDC). For this purpose , four-months-old male C57BL6 mice were fed with normal diet or DDC supplemented diet for 6 weeks. Functional tests to evaluate muscle strength , mobility , and motor skills were performed in alive mice. The muscle strength in isolated gastrocnemius was also assayed via electrophysiological measurements. Morphometric measures of fibers ' diameter , total and ubiquitinated protein levels of myosin heavy chain ( MHC) , E3 ubiquitin ligases , ROS , and oxidation-dependent modified proteins in gastrocnemius tissue were also determined. Our results demonstrated that mice fed the DDC diet developed muscle wasting as evidenced by a loss of muscle mass and decreased muscle strength. The muscles of mice fed with DDC diet have a decreased diameter of fibers and MHC levels , also as increased MuRF-1 and atrogin-1 protein levels , ROS levels , and oxidation-modified protein levels. Additionally , control and DDC mice have the same food and water intake as well as mobility. Our results demonstrate mice with CLD develop sarcopenia involving decreased levels of myofibrillar proteins , increased UPS , and oxidative stress , but not for impaired caloric intake or immobility.
