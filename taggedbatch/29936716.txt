 Purpose: The aims of the study were to estimate the prevalence of breast and cervical cancer screening among women in the South African general population and assess associated factors. Methods: Data from a national populationbased cross-sectional household survey in South Africa in 2012 for 10,831 women aged 30 + years were analysed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression. The outcome variables were cervical cancer screening ( Papanicolaou smear test) and breast cancer screening ( mammography). Exposure variables were sociodemographic factors , lifestyle variables , and chronic conditions. Results: The prevalences of Papanicolaou ( PAP) smear test and mammography participation were 52.0 % and 13.4 % , respectively. On multivariable logistic regression analysis , women with higher education , those who were non-black African , having medical aid and having chronic conditions were more likely to undergo a Pap smear test and mammography. Living in rural areas was related to a lower likelihood of receiving both types of screening. In addition , undertaking moderate or vigorous physical activity was associated with breast cancer screening. Conclusion: Screening for cervical cancer was relatively high but for breast cancer it was low , despite the latter being a major public health problem in South Africa. This may be attributed to the limited availability , affordability , and accessibility of breast cancer screening services among socio-economically disadvantaged individuals There are some socio-economic disparities in adopting both breast and cervical cancer screening guidelines that could be targeted by interventions.
