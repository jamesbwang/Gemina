 To investigate whether Artesunate ( ART) can inhibit the proliferation of THP-1 cells and to explore the potential mechanism of its anti-leukemia effect. THP-1 cells were treated with 5 concentrations of Artesunate for 24 h , 48 h or 72 h. The viability of cells was detected with CCK-8 assay , apoptosis was assessed by using flow cytometry , and the STAT3 , Caspase3 and Caspase8 protein levels were measured with Western blot. Compared with the control group , ART significantly inhibited the proliferation of THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner ( r = 0.9829 , P < 0.05). ART also increased the apoptosis of THP-1 cells. The results of Western blot showed that after treated with ART , the STAT3 protein expression in THP-1 cells was significantly down-regulated ( P < 0.01) , and the expressions of Caspase3 , cleaved Caspase3 and Caspase8 proteins were up-regulated ( P < 0.01). Artesunate can inhibit the proliferation of THP-1 cells , which may relate with the down-regulation of STAT3 expression and the activation of Capase3 and Caspase8.
