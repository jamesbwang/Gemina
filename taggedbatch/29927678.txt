 To examine the effectiveness of blind spot monitoring systems in preventing police-reported lane-change crashes. Poisson regression was used to compare crash involvement rates per insured vehicle year in police-reported lane-change crashes in 26 U.S. states during 2009-2015 between vehicles with blind spot monitoring and the same vehicle models without the optional system , controlling for other factors that can affect crash risk. Crash involvement rates in lane-change crashes were 14 % lower ( 95 % confidence limits -24 % to -2 %) among vehicles with blind spot monitoring than those without. Blind spot monitoring systems are effective in preventing police-reported lane-change crashes when considering crashes of all severities. If every U.S. vehicle in 2015 were equipped with blind spot monitoring that performed like the study systems , it is estimated that about 50,000 crashes could have been prevented.
