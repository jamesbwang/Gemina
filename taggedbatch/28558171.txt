 Finding new high-energy-density materials with desired properties has been intensely-pursued in recent decades. However , the contradictory relationship between high energy and low mechanical sensitivity makes the innovation of insensitive high-energy-density materials an enormous challenge. Here , we show how a materials genome approach can be used to accelerate the discovery of new insensitive high-energy explosives by identification of `` genetic '' features , rapid molecular design , and screening , as well as experimental synthesis of a target molecule , 2,4,6-triamino-5-nitropyrimidine-1,3-dioxide. This as-synthesized energetic compound exhibits a graphite-like layered crystal structure with a high measured density of 1.95 g cm
