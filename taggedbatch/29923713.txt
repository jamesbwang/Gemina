 The fabrication of supramolecular chiral nanostructures from achiral materials without the need of pre-existing chirality is a major challenge associated with the origin of life. Herein , supramolecular chiral twisted nanoribbons of achiral oligoaniline derivatives were prepared via simply performing the chemical oxidation of aniline in an alcohol/water mixed solvent. In particular , the supramolecular chirality of the twisted nanoribbons could be controlled by facilely tuning the alcohol content in the mixed solvent. A tetra-aniline derivative C
