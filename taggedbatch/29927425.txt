 Ependymoma is a central nervous system tumor that grows from ependymal cells lining the cerebral ventricles , central canal of the spinal<disease> cord , and filum terminale. Regardless of the histological type of ependymomas , they rarely have exophytic growth. Because of an extremely low occurrence rate of this phenomenon , we present two clinical cases of patients with classical intramedullary ependymomas ( Grade II) having an extramedullary component. The paper presents two clinical cases of patients with intramedullary-extramedullary ependymomas of the spinal<disease> cord. The surgical technique is described. After surgical treatment , the performance status of patients remained unchanged. Radical removal of complex ependymomas provides conditions for long-term disease-free survival and further neurological recovery.
