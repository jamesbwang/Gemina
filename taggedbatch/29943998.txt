 In anticipation of the introduction of the pre-exposure prophylaxis drugs as an additional HIV<pathogen> prevention tool , we mapped the different positions of Mozambicans ' willingness to use it. Overall , 507 adults indicated willingness to use under different conditions varying as a function of perceived susceptibility to and severity of infection , side effects , administration protocol , and cost. Three qualitatively different positions were found: Unwillingness irrespective of conditions ( 4 %) , depend on circumstances ( 76 %) , and unconditional willingness ( 8 %). A large majority of participants were willing to use pre-exposure prophylaxis drugs , provided that the administration is not too constraining , and the adverse side effects can be minimized.
