 Very recently one of the largest type 1 diabetes prevention trials using daily administration of oral insulin or placebo was completed. After 9 years of study enrollment and follow-up , the randomized controlled trial failed to delay the onset of clinical type 1 diabetes , which was the primary end point. The unfortunate outcome follows the previous large-scale trial , the Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 ( DPT-1) , which again failed to delay diabetes onset with oral insulin or low-dose subcutaneous insulin injections in a randomized controlled trial with relatives at risk for type 1 diabetes. These sobering results raise the important question , `` Where does the type 1 diabetes prevention field move next? '' In this Perspective , we advocate for a paradigm shift in which smaller mechanistic trials are conducted to define immune mechanisms and potentially identify treatment responders. The stage is set for these interventions in individuals at risk for type 1 diabetes as Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet has identified thousands of relatives with islet autoantibodies and general population screening for type 1 diabetes risk is under way. Mechanistic trials will allow for better trial design and patient selection based upon molecular markers prior to large randomized controlled trials , moving toward a personalized medicine approach for the prevention of type 1 diabetes.
