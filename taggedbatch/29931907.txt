 To study the effects of Chai Qin Cheng Qi Decoction ( CQCQD) ( Traditional Chinese Medicine) on severe<pathogen><disease><symptom> acute pancreatitis<disease> ( SAP) complicated liver damage in rats. Seventy-two SD rats were randomly divided into three groups ( Compared with sham group , the activities of AMS , ALT and AST and the serum level of IL-6 in SAP group were increased significantly. The levels of MCP-1 and IL-6 mRNA in pancreas and liver tissue were increased ( MCP-1 takes part in the progression of SAP complicated liver damage; CQCQD can significantly inhibit the expression of pancreas and liver MCP-1 , alleviate pathological damage of pancreas and liver in SAP and play a therapeutic role in SAP complicated liver damage.
