 To identify the effect of dyslipidemia on auditory function detected by Pure Tone Audiometry. To check if dyslipidemia worsens the hearing level in diabetics. This was a comparative study where 120 subjects between the age group of 20 and 50 years underwent pure tone audiometry , lipid profile and blood sugars. Group 1 consisted of 30 subjects with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia; Group 2 had 30 subjects with isolated diabetes; Group 3 had 30 with isolated dyslipidemia and Group 4 included 30 normal subjects as control. Significant hearing loss was seen only in the group with isolated diabetes ( 63 %). The most common type of hearing loss was high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. When comparison was made between the combinations of different lipid profiles , no association was found to the level of hearing. Diabetics are more prone to high frequency hearing loss. Altered lipid profile has no role in causing hearing loss.
