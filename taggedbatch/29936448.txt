 We present a rare case of intracerebral haemorrhage secondary to consumptive coagulopathy in relation to ongoing endoleak after thoracic endovascular aneurysm<disease> repair ( TEVAR). A 68-year-old man underwent elective TEVAR for an 18 cm diameter Crawford type II thoracoabdominal aneurysm<disease>. He was subsequently shown to have a type 1b endoleak and a short episode of disseminated intravascularcoagulation ( DIC) perioperatively. Two months after the procedure , he experienced a consumptive coagulopathy leading to intracerebral haemorrhage and ultimately his death. Endoleak-related DIC is an underappreciated phenomenon within the medical literature. Currently , management is reliant on general DIC principles and anecdotal experiences of others within the case report literature.
