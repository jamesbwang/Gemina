 To investigate the circadian rhythmic alterations of plasma hormone and peptide induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress ( CUMS). Sixty male SD rats were randomly divided into two groups , model group and control group ( Compared with control group , locomotor activity , rearing , weight gain and sucrose consumption in model group were decreased significantly. The values of the percentage of open-arm time ( OT) and open arm entries ( OE) were obviously lower in the model group than those in the control group. The circadian rhythm of plasma ACTH and CORT showed an obvious disorder , including phase advance and decrease in amplitude , and markedly blunted circadian rhythm. There also showed a markedly blunted circadian rhythm and decreased levels of plasma MT. VIP still had 24-hour rhythm , but the amplitude was significantly lower , peak phase also delayed for six hours , and expression was significantly higher. CUMS induces these peptides and hormones desynchronized from suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN) , manifested as the disturbed circadian rhythms and the abnormal hormone secretion of these synchronizers.
