 The nuclear genome decays as organisms age. Numerous studies demonstrate that the burden of several classes of DNA lesions<symptom> is greater in older mammals than in young mammals. More challenging is proving this is a cause rather than a consequence of aging. The DNA damage theory of aging , which argues that genomic instability plays a causal role in aging , has recently gained momentum. Support for this theory stems partly from progeroid syndromes<disease><symptom> in which inherited defects in DNA repair increase the burden of DNA damage leading to accelerated aging of one or more organs. Additionally , growing evidence shows that DNA damage accrual triggers cellular senescence and metabolic changes that promote a decline in tissue function and increased susceptibility to age-related diseases. Here , we examine multiple lines of evidence correlating nuclear DNA damage with aging. We then consider how , mechanistically , nuclear genotoxic stress could promote aging. We conclude that the evidence , in toto , supports a role for DNA damage as a nidus of aging.
