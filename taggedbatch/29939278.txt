 Diaphania angustalis Snellen ( Lepidoptera: Crambidae) has emerged as a very important pest of blackboard tree , Alstonia scholaris ( L.) R. Br. ( Apocynaceae) , in China during the last two decades. Understanding its biology and behavior is crucial for designing effective and environmentally friendly pest management strategies. Under laboratory conditions ( 25-28 °C , 12:12 ( L :D) h , 75-80 % RH) , adults emerged during both light and dark hours with peak emergence occurring between the first and fifth hours of scotophase , and unmated males and females lived for a mean ( ± SE) 5.4 ± 0.4 and 5.3 ± 0.7 d , respectively. Female calling behavior was observed only during scotophase ( peaking in the fifth hour) by 1- to 5-d-old females , and mating activities occurred 2-5 d after emergence , peaking on day 3. These behavioral characteristics could inform control programs targeting adults.
