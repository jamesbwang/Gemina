 Surgical<disease> site<disease> infections<disease> ( SSIs) are associated with considerable medical expenditure. While head and neck free flap reconstruction has gradually become routine management following an ablative oncologic resection , reports on factors contributing to the SSIs are lacking. We retrospectively analyzed 173 new patients with oral cancer without any antecedent treatment at a tertiary medical center from 2010 to 2015. We determined incidence rates of SSIs within 30 days postoperatively and identified independent risk factors using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Of 173 patients , 67 ( 38.7 %) had SSIs. Multivariate analysis demonstrated operative time ( odds ratio ( OR) = 1.199 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.036-1.389) , mandibulectomy ( OR = 2.759; 95 % CI = 1.245-6.111) , and oro-neck communication ( OR = 5.358; 95 % CI = 2.150-13.355) as independent predictors for SSIs. For patients with oral cancer undergoing free tissue reconstruction , mandibulectomy , oro-neck communication , and prolonged operative time were associated with increased incidence of SSIs.
