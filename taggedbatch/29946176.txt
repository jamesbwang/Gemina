 In the United States , the Acute Liver Failure Study Group ( ALFSG) registry lists approximately 11 % of cases as of indeterminate etiology ( IND-ALF) as determined by the respective local site principal investigator ( PI). Traditionally , IND-ALF has prompted concern that other viruses or toxins might be implicated. We hypothesized that many IND- ALF cases would have an identifiable etiology upon further investigation. Improving the identification process should reduce the number of truly indeterminate cases. Specific definitions for each etiology ( `` etiology-specific algorithms '') were developed by a Causality Adjudication Committee that included six reviewers ( each with 20 or more years of experience). Of 2718 patients with ALF , 303 initially deemed IND-ALF by site PIs underwent committee review guided by the algorithms. Acetaminophen ( APAP) protein adducts were measured in sera when available , additional HEV testing was performed , and viral sequences sought by microarray analysis and metagenomic next-generation sequencing ( mNGS). Study sites were asked to provide liver biopsy and/or explant reports and to update serological findings not reported previously. Nearly half ( 142 , 46.9 %) of the 303 IND-ALF cases could be reassigned to a single , defined etiology and rated as highly likely or probable; 11 additional cases , upon review , did not meet ALF criteria. Amongst reassigned etiologies , 45 were previously unrecognized APAP , 34 autoimmune hepatitis<pathogen><disease><symptom> ( AIH) , 24 drug-induced liver injury ( DILI) , 13 various viral causes , 12 ischemia , and 14 miscellaneous other etiologies. The remaining 150 , deemed true IND-ALF , represented just 5.5 %. The indeterminate etiology in ALF includes patients with a diagnosis that is discernible after closer examination. Revision of etiologic diagnoses of indeterminate cases using added testing and expert opinion is useful in understanding all aspects of ALF.
