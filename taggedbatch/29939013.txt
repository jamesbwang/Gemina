 Nanoscale topological imaging using atomic force microscopy ( AFM) combined with infrared ( IR) spectroscopy ( AFM-IR) is a rapidly emerging modality to record correlated structural and chemical images. Although the expectation is that the spectral data faithfully represents the underlying chemical composition , the sample mechanical properties affect the recorded data ( known as the probe-sample-interaction effect). Although experts in the field are aware of this effect , the contribution is not fully understood. Further , when the sample properties are not well-known or when AFM-IR experiments are conducted by nonexperts , there is a chance that these nonmolecular properties may affect analytical measurements in an uncertain manner. Techniques such as resonance-enhanced imaging and normalization of the IR signal using ratios might improve fidelity of recorded data , but they are not universally effective. Here , we provide a fully analytical model that relates cantilever response to the local sample expansion which opens several avenues. We demonstrate a new method for removing probe-sample-interaction effects in AFM-IR images by measuring the cantilever responsivity using a mechanically induced , out-of-plane sample vibration. This method is then applied to model polymers and mammary epithelial cells to show improvements in sensitivity , accuracy , and repeatability for measuring soft matter when compared to the current state of the art ( resonance-enhanced operation). Understanding of the sample-dependent cantilever responsivity is an essential addition to AFM-IR imaging if the identification of chemical features at nanoscale resolutions is to be realized for arbitrary samples.
