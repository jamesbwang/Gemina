 In this work , synergistic effect of solar photocatalysis integrated with adsorption process towards the degradation of Congo red ( CR) was investigated via two different approaches using a photocatalytic membrane reactor. In the first approach , sequential treatments were conducted through the adsorption by graphene oxide ( GO) and then followed by photocatalytic oxidation using Fe-doped ZnO nanocomposites ( NCs). In the second approach , however , CR solution was treated by photocatalytic oxidation using Fe-doped ZnO/rGO NCs. These nanocomposites were synthesized by a sol-gel method. The NCs were characterized by X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , photoluminescence ( PL) , Fourier transmission infrared ( FTIR) , ultraviolet-visible ( UV-vis) spectroscopy , and field emission scanning electron microscopy ( FESEM). It was observed that Fe-doped ZnO could enhance the photoactivity of ZnO under solar light. When Fe-doped ZnO were decorated on GO sheets , however , this provided a surface enhancement for adsorption of organic pollutants. The photocatalytic performances using both approaches were evaluated based on the degradation of CR molecules in aqueous solution under solar irradiation. Nanofiltration ( NF) performance in terms of CR residual removal from water and their fouling behavior during post-separation of photocatalysts was studied. Serious flux declined and thicker fouling layer on membrane were found in photocatalytic membrane reactor using Fe-doped ZnO/rGO NCs which could be attributed to the stronger π-π interaction between rGO and CR solution.
