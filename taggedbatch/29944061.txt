 Prior studies have not described strategies for implementing transitional care in skilled nursing facilities ( SNFs). As part of the Connect-Home study , we pilot tested the Transition Plan of Care ( TPOC) template , an implementation tool that SNF staff used to deliver transitional care. A retrospective chart review was used to describe the impact of the TPOC template on three implementation outcomes: reach to patients , staff adoption of the template , and staff fidelity to the intervention protocol for transition care planning. The template reached 100 % of eligible patients ( N = 68). Adoption was high , with documentation by four disciplines in 90.6 % of patient records ( N = 61). Fidelity to the intervention protocol was moderately high , with 73 % of documentation that was concordant with the protocol. Our findings suggest an electronic medical record ( EMR)- based implementation tool may increase the ability of staff to prepare older adults and their caregivers for self-care at home. Further research is needed to test the efficacy of the protocol on patient outcomes after transitions from SNF to home.
