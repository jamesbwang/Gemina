 Information regarding the prevalence and risk of osteoporosis among American Indian ( AI) women is limited. This study showed that with increasing AI blood quantum , the prevalence of osteoporosis at the hip based on BMD T-scores decreased and this appeared to be independent of other risk factors. This study was designed to investigate the effects of AI blood quantum ( BQ) on osteoporosis prevalence and risk in a cohort of AI women in Oklahoma. Women ( n = 301) , aged 50 years and older , were recruited to participate in the Oklahoma American Indian Women 's Osteoporosis Study. Baseline bone density , fracture history , bone biochemical markers , and potential risk factors were assessed. Participants were stratified by AI BQ into BQ1 â‰¤ 25 % , BQ2 = 25-49 % , BQ3 = 50-74 % , and BQ4 = 75-100 %. The effects of BQ on the prevalence and risk of osteoporosis were evaluated. Based on T-scores , one in approximately eight women in the study was osteoporotic at one or more sites. The prevalence of osteoporosis decreased ( p < 0.05) with increasing BQ , especially at the hip , trochanteric , and intertrochanter regions. No differences in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and C-telopeptide were observed across BQ that could account for the differences in bone density. 25-OH vitamin D decreased with increasing BQ , but mean for each BQ1-4 was > 40 ng/mL. Fracture history did not differ across BQ , and though 52 % of the population consumed less than the RDA for calcium , no effect of BQ was observed. In this cohort of women who identified as AI , greater Indian BQ was associated with a decrease in the prevalence of osteoporosis.
