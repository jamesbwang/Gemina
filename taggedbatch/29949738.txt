 There is strong retrospective data demonstrating that BIMA grafting leads to better long-term survival as compared to LIMA grafting. However , this survival advantage was not corroborated by the interim results of the Arterial Revascularization Trial ( ART). Today , there are barriers to widespread adoption of BIMA grafting. One of the main disadvantages of the use of BIMA grafts is the higher risk of DSWI. Deep sternal<disease> wound<disease><symptom> infections<disease> can be minimized by skeletonized harvesting of the IMA grafts , which preserves blood flow to the sternum. Also , utilizing the BIMA graft as a `` Y '' graft may lead to more complete revascularization compared to its in-situ use. BIMA grafting on average takes 25 minutes longer operating time with a higher in-hospital costs. We eagerly await the 10-year results of the ART trial to determine the truly unbiased randomized long-term effectiveness of BIMA grafting.
