 Infectious<disease> diseases<disease> remain one of the major causes of death worldwide in developing countries. While screening via conventional polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) is the gold standard in laboratory testing , its limited applications at the point-of-care have prompted the development of more portable nucleic acid detection systems. These include isothermal DNA amplification techniques , which are less equipment-intensive than PCR. Unfortunately , these techniques still require extensive sample preparation , limiting user accessibility. In this study , we introduce a novel system that combines thermophilic helicase-dependent amplification ( tHDA) with a Triton X-100 micellar aqueous two-phase system ( ATPS) to achieve cell lysis , lysate processing , and enhanced nucleic acid amplification in a simple , one-step process. The combined one-pot system was able to amplify and detect a target gene from whole-cell samples containing as low as 10
