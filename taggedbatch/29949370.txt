 Structural modifications of molecular cobalt catalysts have provided important insights into the structure-function relationship for the hydrogen evolution reaction. We have shown that replacement of equatorial pyridines with more basic and conjugate isoquinoline groups of a pentadentate ligand results in lower overpotential and higher catalytic activity for electro- and photolytic H
