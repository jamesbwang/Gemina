 The function of abscisic acid ( ABA) is mediated by its receptors termed RCARs/PYR1/PYLs. Modulation of ABA signaling is vital for plant growth and development. The RCAR-PP2C-SnRK2 regulatory modules have been defined as the core components in ABA signaling. However , it is still not clear whether and how the ABA receptors could be modified at the initial post-translational stage to fine-tune ABA transduction pathway. Here we identify and characterize the putative receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase ( RLCK) in Arabidopsis named CARK1 , which interacts with RCAR3 ( PYL8) and RCAR11 ( PYR1) in the manner of phosphorylation. Structural studies of CARK1 revealed the critical active site , N204 , which accounts for the kinase activity and the direct interaction with RCAR3/RCAR11. CARK1 phosphorylates RCAR3/RCAR11 at one conserved threonine site , T77/T78. Our genetic analyses further demonstrated that
