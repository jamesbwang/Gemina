 Pediatric low-grade gliomas ( PLGGs) consist of a number of entities with overlapping histological features. PLGGs have much better prognosis than the adult counterparts , but a significant proportion of PLGGs suffers from tumor progression and recurrence. It has been shown that pediatric and adult low-grade gliomas are molecularly distinct. Yet the clinical significance of some of newer biomarkers discovered by genomic studies has not been fully investigated. In this study , we evaluated in a large cohort of 289 PLGGs a list of biomarkers and examined their clinical relevance. TERT promoter ( TERTp) , H3F3A and BRAF V600E mutations were detected by direct sequencing. ATRX nuclear loss was examined by immunohistochemistry. CDKN2A deletion , KIAA1549-BRAF fusion , and MYB amplification were determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH). TERTp , H3F3A , and BRAF V600E mutations were identified in 2.5 , 6.4 , and 7.4 % of PLGGs , respectively. ATRX loss was found in 4.9 % of PLGGs. CDKN2A deletion , KIAA1549-BRAF fusion and MYB amplification were detected in 8.8 , 32.0 and 10.6 % of PLGGs , respectively. Survival analysis revealed that TERTp mutation , H3F3A mutation , and ATRX loss were significantly associated with poor PFS ( p < 0.0001 , p < 0.0001 , and p = 0.0002) and OS ( p < 0.0001 , p < 0.0001 , and p < 0.0001). BRAF V600E was associated with shorter PFS ( p = 0.011) and OS ( p = 0.032) in a subset of PLGGs. KIAA1549-BRAF fusion was a good prognostic marker for longer PFS ( p = 0.0017) and OS ( p = 0.0029). MYB amplification was also a favorable marker for a longer PFS ( p = 0.040). Importantly , we showed that these molecular biomarkers can be used to stratify PLGGs into low- ( KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or MYB amplification) , intermediate-I ( BRAF V600E and/or CDKN2A deletion) , intermediate-II ( no biomarker) , and high-risk ( TERTp or H3F3A mutation or ATRX loss) groups with distinct PFS ( p < 0.0001) and OS ( p < 0.0001). This scheme should aid in clinical decision-making.
