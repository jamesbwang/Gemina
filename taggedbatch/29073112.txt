 Formation of functional myelin sheaths within the central nervous system depends on expression of myelin basic protein ( MBP). Following process extension and wrapping around axonal segments , this highly basic protein is required for compaction of the multi-layered membrane sheath produced by oligodendrocytes. MBP is hypothesized to be targeted to the membrane sheath by mRNA transport and local translation , which ensures that its expression is temporally and spatially restricted. The mechanistic details of how this might be regulated are still largely unknown , in particular because a model system that allows this process to be studied
