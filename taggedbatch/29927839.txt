 Le fort I maxillary osteotomies and sagittal split mandibular osteotomies are performed to correct significant dentofacial deformities. The multidimensional skeletal movements , particularly those of large magnitude may result in contour irregularities and facial imbalances. Three dimensional images were reconstructed from computed tomographic ( CT) scans in patients unhappy with their appearances after Le Fort I advancement and/or bilateral sagittal split osteotomies ( BSSO). The data from these scans were used to computer design and computer manufacture ( CAD/CAM) alloplastic implants for surgical correction of contour irregularities and imbalances. These implants were surgically placed through intraoral and submental incisions and fixed using titanium screws. A total of 21 patients underwent CAD/CAM implant placement. One patient required removal of implants secondary to infection. All other patients were satisfied with their result. The use of CAD/CAM implants and surgical placement has effective in refining appearance in 21 patients over a seven year period with minimal morbidity.
