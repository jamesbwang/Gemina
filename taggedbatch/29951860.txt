 Garlic oil can disrupt the quorum sensing ( QS) pathways of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen>; however , the underlying mechanisms for this effect are unclear. Diallyl disulfide ( DADS) is one of the most abundant sulfur-containing compounds in garlic oil. This study investigated the effects of DADS on the growth , virulence factor production ( elastase , pyocyanin , biofilm , and swarming motility) , and essential gene expression of P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> PAO1 , particularly as they apply to QS and virulence. DADS at 1.28 mg/mL did not affect P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> PAO1 growth , although it decreased elastase and pyocyanin production , biofilm formation , and swarming motility. Each of these phenomena is regulated by the three QS systems of P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> PAO1 ( las , rhl , and pqs). Real-time q-PCR revealed that DADS down-regulated the transcription levels of several important QS genes ( lasI , lasR , rhlI , rhlR , pqsA , and pqsR) in the three systems. Furthermore , the transcription levels of QS-regulated virulence genes were also down-regulated. The lasB gene , encoding LasB elastase , is co-regulated by the las , rhl , and pqs systems , and thus the down-regulation of genes across the three systems further down-regulated lasB. Additionally , phzM ( encoding pyocyanin) , pslB ( responsible for the production of a biofilm matrix polysaccharide) , and chiC ( encoding chitinase) were positively activated by LasR , and a decrease in lasR transcription further down-regulated the transcription of phzM , pslB , and chiC. Hence , DADS inhibits P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> PAO1 virulence factors by inactivating the transcription of key genes across three different QS systems.
