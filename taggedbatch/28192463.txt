 Magneto-inductive ( MI) communication is a viable technology for wireless communications in underwater and underground environments. In this paper , a new design for an MI transmitter is presented. Unlike conventional MI transmitters that utilize coiled loops or solenoids to generate magnetic fields , we demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using a rotating permanent magnet. We also present and experimentally verify a modulation technique that does not involve changing the rotational speed of the magnet. By electrically changing the permeability of a surrounding shield , the fields from the rotating magnet are amplitude modulated. Our findings suggest that increased efficiency and bandwidth can be realized compared to conventional MI transmitters.
