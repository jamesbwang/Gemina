 Biogenic volatile organic compounds ( BVOCs) are major precursors of both ozone and secondary organic aerosols ( SOA) in the troposphere and represent a non-negligible portion of the carbon fixed by primary producers , but long-term ecosystem-scale measurements of their exchanges with the atmosphere are lacking. In this study , the fluxes of 46 ions corresponding to 36 BVOCs were continuously monitored along with the exchanges of mass ( carbon dioxide and water vapor) and energy ( sensible and latent heat) for an entire year in a poplar (
