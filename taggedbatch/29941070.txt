 Peptide nucleic acid ( PNA) is a synthetic analogue of DNA in which the natural nucleobases A , G , C , and T are linked to an achiral , charge neutral , pseudopeptide backbone. PNA strands can form double helices similar to DNA whose helical sense can be modulated by applying the ` sergeants-and-soldiers ' principle. Attachment of a chiral amino acid ( sergeant) at the C-terminus of PNA leads to the amplification of chirality of the sergeant onto the achiral PNA monomers ( soldiers) , resulting in an enantiomeric excess of either left- or right-handed PNA duplexes. In the present study we looked at the effect of an achiral N-terminal terpyridine ( soldier) on the helicity of the double helix that contains <small> L </small>- lysine. We have found that terpyridine interferes with the chiral induction effect of the <small> L </small>- lysines , an effect that can be reverted upon coordination of Cu2 + ions to terpyridine.
