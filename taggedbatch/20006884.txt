 To present the surgical and pathological results of robotic radical cystectomy ( RRC) operations performed in our clinic. A total of 18 patients , who underwent RRC and intracorporeal urinary diversion between October 2016 and September 2017 for clinically localized bladder cancer in our clinic , were included in the study. The results were evaluated under three headings. 1. operative outcomes ( total operation time , perioperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , postoperative hematocrit decrease) 2. recovery period ( pull-off drain day , hospitalization time) 3. oncological results ( pathologic stage , surgical margin , number , and characteristics of lymph nodes removed). Complications within the postoperative 30-day period , were evaluated and the Clavien classification system was used to classify the complications. The mean age of the patients was 64.4 ( 52-80) years. Seventeen male patients and one female patient underwent robotic cystectomy. At the operative outcomes , the mean blood<symptom> loss<symptom> was 325 mL , and the mean hematocrit decrease was 3.15 %. The mean duration of the surgery was 471 minutes ( 330-630) , while the median operative time was 450 minutes. Complications occured in 6 patients during the early postoperative period. Six of them ( 75 %) had minor complications ( Clavien grade 1) , two patients ( 25 %) had major complications ( Clavien grade 4). Our initial experience with RRC is that , this surgical technique has acceptable operative , oncological and short-term clinical outcomes. However , prospective randomized studies are needed to assess whether there is a clear advantage compared to open surgery.
