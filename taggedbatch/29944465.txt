 The diagnosis of diabetes in pre-school children poses a number of unique challenges related to everyday responsibility , and the continuous need for supervision and caregiving. This may affect both the child 's and the parents ' perceived burden caused by the condition. The aim of the study was to explore the lived experience of being mothers and fathers of a child with type 1 diabetes aged 1 to 7 years. The study is rooted in an interpretive phenomenological methodology as described by van Manen. In-depth interviews were carried out to collect data. We were able to identify one essential theme across the interviews: Striving to live an ordinary family life , yet feeling and living very differently-with interrelated sub-themes: A life-changing situation , Always on guard , and Struggling to let go. Parents described a profoundly changed situation , and they were indeed striving to live like a `` normal '' family. They were in need of support from health care professionals at the outpatient clinic , not only support and supervision in regard to practical tasks , but also concerning handling a changed life situation and emotional reactions , especially in the first year after diagnosis.
