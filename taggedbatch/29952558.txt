 The use of cell factories for the production of bulk and value-added compounds is nowadays an advantageous alternative to the traditional petrochemical methods. Nevertheless , the efficiency and productivity of several of these processes can improve with the implementation of micro-oxic or anoxic conditions. In the industrial setting , laccases are appealing catalysts that can oxidize a wide range of substrates and reduce O
