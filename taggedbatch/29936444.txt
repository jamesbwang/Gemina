 A 56-year-old right-handed woman was successfully treated by coil embolisation for a large unruptured paraclinoid aneurysm<disease> of the left internal carotid artery. Though she was discharged on day 3 after the intervention with uneventful clinical course , she was rehospitalised for continuous<symptom> headache<symptom> and right upper limb<symptom> weakness<symptom> 2 weeks after the treatment. Subsequent progression of cognitive dysfunction and right hemiparesis<symptom> were observed. Repeated MRI revealed diffuse leucoencephalopathy within the ipsilateral brain hemisphere. Clinical course , serological examination , and radiological findings were consistent with localised hypocomplemental vasculitis caused by delayed hypersensitivity<disease> reaction. Immunosuppressive treatments using prednisolone successfully improved her symptoms. After a washout period for immunosuppressant , skin reaction test was performed and revealed polyglycolic-polylactic acid , coating material of the coil , positive for delayed allergic reaction. Given the increased frequency of endovascular treatment for unruptured aneurysms<disease> , even such a rare complication should be recognised and treated properly to avoid neurological sequelae.
