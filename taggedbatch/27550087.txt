 Precision medicine requires the ability to predict the efficacies of different treatments for a given individual using high-dimensional genomic measurements. However , identifying predictive features remains a challenge when the sample size is small. Incorporating expert knowledge offers a promising approach to improve predictions , but collecting such knowledge is laborious if the number of candidate features is very large. We introduce a probabilistic framework to incorporate expert feedback about the impact of genomic measurements on the outcome of interest and present a novel approach to collect the feedback efficiently , based on Bayesian experimental design. The new approach outperformed other recent alternatives in two medical applications: prediction of metabolic traits and prediction of sensitivity of cancer cells to different drugs , both using genomic features as predictors. Furthermore , the intelligent approach to collect feedback reduced the workload of the expert to approximately 11 % , compared to a baseline approach.
