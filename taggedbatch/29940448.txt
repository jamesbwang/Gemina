 Water use efficiency ( WUE) and nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency ( NUE) of winter wheat are urgently needed to further improve in the North China Plain ( NCP). In this study , a 3-year field experiment was conducted during the 2014-2017 growing seasons to clarify the effect of traditional flood irrigation ( TI) , surface drip irrigation ( DI) , and micro-sprinkling irrigation ( MSI) on grain yield , WUE , and NUE of winter wheat. Across the 3 years , grain yield of DI and MSI improved by 9.79 % and 14.1 % , WUE of DI and MSI increased by 12.3 % and 17.7 % , and NUE of DI and MSI increased by 9.77 % and 14.0 % , respectively compared with those of TI. Wheat subjected to the micro-irrigation treatments ( DI and MSI) had higher chlorophyll content in flag leaves 10 days post-anthesis; this postponed senescence of the flag leaves , which increased dry matter accumulation post-anthesis , and increased 1000-grain weight and grain yield. The micro-irrigation treatments reduced pre-anthesis water consumption but increased post-anthesis water consumption and ensured the water supply in the top soil layer at the critical stage , thus increasing WUE. Root length density ( RLD) of TI in the 0-80-cm soil layer was significantly higher than that of micro-irrigation , whereas micro-irrigation had higher RLD than TI below the 80-cm soil layer , which promoted the absorption and utilization of water and nitrogen in deep soil. The micro-irrigation treatments increased total nitrogen accumulation of the plants , reduced soil nitrate nitrogen ( NO
