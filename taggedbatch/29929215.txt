 New restricted access materials based on microporous hypercrosslinked polystyrene have been developed. The materials are aimed to use as packings for solid-phase extraction cartridges to isolate low-molecular-weight analytes from biological fluids ( for instance , blood plasma or serum). Two features distinguish these polymers from all known restricted access materials. The first one consists of the microporous hypercrosslinked polystyrene that not only exclude proteins from the sorbent phase but also do not adsorb them on the bead outer surface , and so they do not cause coagulation of blood protein components. Therefore , these materials do not require any chemical modification. The second distinguishing feature is the ability of hypercrosslinked sorbents to take up a wide variety of polar and nonpolar organic compounds. The sorbents were obtained in the form of beads of 60-70 Î¼m in diameter by cross-linking styrene copolymers with 1 , 2 , and 3 % divinylbenzene with monochlorodimethyl ether to 100 , 150 , and 200 % cross-linking degree. The sorbents exhibit all typical properties of hypercrosslinked networks. They do not take up albumin , the major blood protein , and cytochrome C , representative of smaller protein molecules , but are capable of adsorbing drugs , vitamins , and phenyl carboxylic acids ( markers of sepsis<disease>) from model aqueous solutions.
