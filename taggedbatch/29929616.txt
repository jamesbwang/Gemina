 Prognosis in light-chain ( AL) and transthyretin ( ATTR) amyloidosis is influenced by cardiac involvement. ATTR amyloidosis has better prognosis than AL amyloidosis despite more amyloid infiltration , suggesting additional mechanisms of damage in AL amyloidosis. The aim of the study was to assess the presence and prognostic significance of myocardial edema<symptom> in patients with amyloidosis. The study recruited 286 patients: 100 with systemic AL amyloidosis , 163 with cardiac ATTR amyloidosis , 12 with suspected cardiac ATTR amyloidosis ( grade 1 on Myocardial T2 was increased in amyloidosis with the degree of elevation being highest in untreated AL patients ( untreated AL amyloidosis 56.6 ± 5.1 ms; treated AL amyloidosis 53.6 ± 3.9 ms; ATTR amyloidosis 54.2 ± 4.1 ms; each p < 0.01 compared with control subjects: 48.9 ± 2.0 ms). Left ventricular ( LV) mass and extracellular volume fraction were higher in ATTR amyloidosis compared with AL amyloidosis while LV ejection fraction was lower ( p < 0.001). Histological evidence of edema<symptom> was present in 87.5 % of biopsy samples ranging from 5 % to 40 % myocardial involvement. Using Cox regression models , myocardial T2 predicted death in AL amyloidosis ( hazard ratio: 1.48; 95 % confidence interval: 1.20 to 1.82) and remained significant after adjusting for extracellular volume fraction and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( hazard ratio: 1.32; 95 % confidence interval: 1.05 to 1.67). Myocardial edema<symptom> is present in cardiac amyloidosis by histology and cardiovascular magnetic resonance T2 mapping. T2 is higher in untreated AL amyloidosis compared with treated AL and ATTR amyloidosis , and is a predictor of prognosis in AL amyloidosis. This suggests mechanisms additional to amyloid infiltration contributing to mortality in amyloidosis.
