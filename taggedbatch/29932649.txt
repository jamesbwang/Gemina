 Mucoadhesion is defined as the adhesion of a material to the mucus gel covering the mucous<symptom> membranes<symptom>. The mechanisms controlling mucoadhesion include nonspecific electrostatic interactions and specific interactions between the materials and the mucins , the heavily glycosylated proteins that form the mucus gel. Mucoadhesive materials can be used to develop mucosal wound<disease><symptom> dressings and noninvasive transmucosal drug delivery systems. Spider silk , which is strong , biocompatible , biodegradable , nontoxic , and lightweight would serve as an excellent base for the development of such materials. Here , we investigated two variants of the partial spider silk protein 4RepCT genetically engineered in order to functionalize them with mucoadhesive properties. The pLys-4RepCT variant was functionalized with six cationically charged lysines , aiming to provide nonspecific adhesion from electrostatic interactions with the anionically charged mucins , while the hGal3-4RepCT variant was genetically fused with the Human Galectin-3 Carbohydrate Recognition Domain which specifically binds the mucin glycans Galβ1-3GlcNAc and Galβ1-4GlcNAc. First , we demonstrated that coatings , fibers , meshes , and foams can be readily made from both silk variants. Measured by the adsorption of both bovine submaxillary mucin and pig gastric mucin , the newly produced silk materials showed enhanced mucin binding properties compared with materials of wild-type ( 4RepCT) silk. Moreover , we showed that pLys-4RepCT silk coatings bind mucins through electrostatic interactions , while hGal3-4RepCT silk coatings bind mucins through specific glycan-protein interactions. We envision that the two new mucoadhesive silk variants pLys-4RepCT and hGal3-4RepCT , alone or combined with other biofunctional silk proteins , constitute useful new building blocks for a range of silk protein-based materials for mucosal treatments.
