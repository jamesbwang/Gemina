 Accurate and detailed description of a `` normal vulva '' is rare , even though few studies dealt with the topic of normal measurements of parts of the external female genitalia. This leads to a situation with a wide range of existing diagnoses concerning `` normal '' vulvar morphology. Cross-sectional prospective single center study. From August 2015 to April 2017 we included 657 women in our gynecological and uro-gynecological outpatient clinic of the Cantonal Hospital Lucerne. We recruited Caucasian women aged 15-84 years. Standardized defined measurements were taken of the clitoral gland , distance from the base of the gland to the urethral orifice , length of introitus , length of perineum , length of labia majora , length and width of labia minora. Furthermore we recorded baseline characteristics. The length of labia minora ( r = -.364 , p < .001 , n = 657) as well as the length of the perineum ( r = -.095 , p = .014 , n = 657) are inversely correlated with the age. A positive correlation between BMI and the length of the labia majora ( r = .150 , p < .001 , n = 657) and the length of the introitus ( r = .097 , p = .014 , n = 657) was found. We provide detailed-data on age-related dimensions and description of the external female genitalia in a homogenous group of caucasian women. With our data we present a baseline for the appearance of a normal caucasian vulva , which could set up standards for indication in gynecological cosmetic surgery.
