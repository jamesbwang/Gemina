 Non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma ( NCIE) is characterized by skin scaling with erythema. In this study , two Pakistani families with NCIE are genetically characterized through Whole Exome and Sanger sequencing to identify molecular basis of the disease. We identified a nonsense homozygous c. 2026C > T mutation of ALOXE3 , causing premature termination of the eLOX3 protein ( p.Q676X). In silico studies predicted impaired enzymatic activity of the premature truncated eLOX3 , leading to abnormal synthesis of specific hepoxilin derivatives , essential for epidermal barrier formation. It is the first ever study reporting homozygotes of p.Q676X mutation in ethnically distinct two Pakistani families; otherwise , heterozygotes of the said mutation have been reported in South Asian population only. Hence , mutation seems to be region-specific and may be useful for molecular diagnosis of NCIE. Moreover , our findings should help in genetic counseling and career screening.
